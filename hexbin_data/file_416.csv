3508,Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation with prone position ventilation successfully rescues infantile pertussis: a case report and literature review,2018-11-30,"BACKGROUND: Bordetella pertussis can cause fatal illness with severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and pulmonary hypertension (PHT). CASE PRESENTATION: A 6-month-old non-vaccinated boy with B. pertussis infection who developed ARDS was treated by extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). During his ECMO support stage, sudden occurred decreasing of ECMO flow implied increasing intrathoracic pressure. The airway spasm followed caused sudden drop of ventilator tidal volume as well as poor lung compliance. Prone position ventilation and bundle care were conducted as lung protection ventilator strategy. After 297-h of ECMO support, the patient was weaned off ECMO, and extubated one week later. CONCLUSIONS: In this patient with severe ARDS caused by Bordetella pertussis, ECMO was performed for cardiopulmonary support and rescued the infant with severe pertussis. During ECMO support period, prone position ventilation and care bundle nursing strategy contributed to the relief of continuous airway spasm.

4262,"Effect of prior receipt of antibiotics on the pathogen distribution: a retrospective observational cohort study on 27,792 patients",2020-01-06,"BACKGROUND: There have been no systematic studies of microbiological differences before and after antibiotics treatment. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of prior receipt of antibiotics on the microorganism distribution. METHODS: A retrospective, observational cohort study was conducted in a 3200-bed tertiary, referral, teaching hospital in eastern China. During a 2-year period, all hospitalized patients treated with antimicrobial agents were enrolled in this study. Among 48,692 patients evaluated, the 27,792 (57.1%) who were sampled within 2 days before or after administration of the first dose of antimicrobial agents were included. Distribution of clinical specimens and the microorganism were compared between before and after antibiotic drug treatment groups. RESULTS: Compared to specimens taken after antibiotics exposure, specimens taken before antibiotics exposure had a higher proportion of blood and urine specimens and a higher culture positive rate (all P < 0.001). Higher percentages of Staphylococcus aureus (9.9% vs. 8.5%, P = 0.041), non-fermenting bacteria (27.7% vs. 19.9%, P < 0.001), and fungi (8.4% vs. 4.0%, P < 0.001) were isolated from the group after antibiotics exposure, while the percentages of Streptococcus spp. (4.8% vs. 2.7%, P < 0.001), Haemophilus influenzae (2.3% vs. 0.8%, P < 0.001), and Moraxella catarrhalis (0.7% vs. 0.1%, P < 0.001) were higher in the group before antibiotics exposure. Further analysis found significant differences of microbes derived from respiratory secretions, blood or urine samples. We found, after antibiotics exposure, the separation rate of non-fermenting bacteria was significantly increased (all P < 0.05), and the separation rate of Candida spp. was higher, with statistical significance in airway secretion and urine samples (both P < 0.05), but the separation rate of Staphylococcus aureus among the three groups was not affected by antibiotics. In addition, the isolation rate of Streptococcus spp. in blood and urine samples decreased significantly (both P < 0.05) after antibiotics exposure. Interestingly, no statistical difference was found for microbes isolated from body fluid specimens between the two groups. CONCLUSIONS: The outcome revealed that antibiotic-insensitive organisms such as non-fermentative bacteria and fungi were more frequently isolated after antibiotics exposure. However, this trend might be specimen dependent and was not obvious in body fluid specimens.","Li, Leiqing; Xu, Lingcheng; Zhu, Rongsheng; Song, Jiaojiao; Wang, Xuanding",BMC Infect Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6945440/,416
4279,Prevalence of Toxocara and Toxascaris infection among human and animals in Iran with meta-analysis approach,2020-01-07,"BACKGROUND: Toxocariasis is a worldwide zoonotic parasitic disease caused by species of Toxocara and Toxascaris, common in dogs and cats. Herein, a meta-analysis was contrived to assess the prevalence of Toxocara/Toxascaris in carnivore and human hosts in different regions of Iran from April 1969 to June 2019. METHODS: The available online articles of English (PubMed, Science Direct, Scopus, and Ovid) and Persian (SID, Iran Medex, Magiran, and Iran Doc) databases and also the articles that presented in held parasitology congresses of Iran were involved. RESULTS: The weighted prevalence of Toxocara/Toxascaris in dogs (Canis familiaris) and cats (Felis catus) was 24.2% (95% CI: 18.0–31.0%) and 32.6% (95% CI: 22.6–43.4%), respectively. Also, pooled prevalence in jackal (Canis aureus) and red fox (Vulpes vulpes) was 23.3% (95% CI: 7.7–43.2%) and 69.4% (95% CI: 60.3–77.8%), correspondingly. Weighted mean prevalence of human cases with overall 28 records was 9.3% (95% CI: 6.3–13.1%). The weighted prevalence of Toxocara canis, Toxocara cati, and Toxascaris leonina was represented as 13.8% (95% CI: 9.8–18.3%), 28.5% (95% CI: 20–37.7%) and 14.3% (95% CI: 8.1–22.0%), respectively. CONCLUSION: Our meta-analysis results illustrate a considerable prevalence rate of Toxocara/Toxascaris, particularly in cats and dogs of northern parts of Iran. The presence of suitable animal hosts, optimum climate and close contact of humans and animals would have been the reason for higher seroprevalence rates of human cases in our region. Given the significance clinical outcomes of human Toxocara/Toxascaris, necessary measures should be taken.","Eslahi, Aida Vafae; Badri, Milad; Khorshidi, Ali; Majidiani, Hamidreza; Hooshmand, Elham; Hosseini, Hamid; Taghipour, Ali; Foroutan, Masoud; Pestehchian, Nader; Firoozeh, Farzaneh; Riahi, Seyed Mohammad; Zibaei, Mohammad",BMC Infect Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6947998/,416

We report a 23-year-old immunocompetent man presenting with painful progressive loss of vision, ophthalmoplegia and proptosis of the right eye suggestive of OAS. MRI with gadolinium contrast showed an enhancing heterogeneous mass filling the paranasal sinuses, extraconal space and extending up to the right orbital apex. A functional endoscopic biopsy reported as invasive sino-orbital aspergillosis. He was started on intravenous voriconazole and maximal surgical debridement was done. He gradually regained his vision to 20/30 in the right eye. A review of literature reported several such cases which were managed medically or surgically but with poor visual recovery. This case highlights the need for awareness among clinicians for early diagnosis and treatment to prevent vision loss and better survival.","Parija, Sucheta; Banerjee, Aparajita",BMJ Case Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7818795/,416
14929,Lower lumbar back pain occurring with transient hip osteoporosis: complication of prolonged suffering and neck of femur fracture in a 24-year-old pregnant patient,2021-01-20,"OBJECTIVE: Associations between self-reported sleep duration and obesity indices in children are well recognised; however, there are no studies on associations between objectively measured other sleep parameters and physical activity with body composition in preschoolers. Therefore, the aim of this study was to determine the associations between sleep parameters and moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) with body composition indices in preschoolers using objective measures. DESIGN: A cross-sectional study. PARTICIPANTS: The study group consisted of 676 children aged 5–6 years, who were enrolled in kindergartens in the 2017/2018 school year. OUTCOME MEASURES: Sleep parameters and MVPA were measured using accelerometers for 7 days. Bioelectrical impedance analysis was used to estimate body composition. RESULTS: Sleep duration and sleep efficiency were inversely associated with body fat percentage (BFP) (β=−0.013 and β from –0.311 to −0.359, respectively) and body mass index (BMI) (β from −0.005 to −0.006 and from −0.105 to –0.121, respectively), and directly associated with fat-free mass (FFM) (β from 0.010 to 0.011 and from 0.245 to 0.271, respectively) and muscle mass (β from 0.012 to 0.012 and from 0.277 to 0.307, respectively) in unadjusted and adjusted models. BFP was inversely associated with MVPA and positively associated with number of awakenings and sleep periods. Number of sleep periods was inversely associated with FFM, and positively with BMI and muscle mass. Correlation matrix indicated significant correlation between BFP, FFM and muscle mass with sleep duration, sleep efficiency, number of sleep periods and MVPA. CONCLUSIONS: Periodic assessment of sleep parameters and MVPA in relation to body composition in preschool children may be considered, especially in those who are at risk for obesity.","Wyszyńska, Justyna; Matłosz, Piotr; Asif, Muhammad; Szybisty, Agnieszka; Lenik, Paweł; Dereń, Katarzyna; Mazur, Artur; Herbert, Jarosław",BMJ Open,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7818825/,416
17555,Effective treatment of electrical storm by a wearable cardioverter defibrillator in a patient with severely impaired left ventricular function after myocardial infarction: a case report,2021-05-17,"BACKGROUND: Depression is a highly prevalent mental disorder with major public health effects globally. It impairs the quality of life and reduces the ability to work and function, leading to increasing costs of sick leaves and disability pensions. Current treatment strategies focus on biological and psychological pathways while understating the role of lifestyle factors. Epidemiological studies have shown convincing evidence of an inverse relationship between diet quality and depression. However, only limited data are available on the therapeutic effects of diet quality improvement on depression. Using a randomized controlled trial design, our primary aim is to investigate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of a behavioral nutrition group intervention compared to a social support intervention in the treatment of depression. METHODS: Participants (N=144, aged 20–65 years) with a diagnosis of moderate or severe depression recruited in collaboration with outpatient care units will be randomized into two arms: Food for Mind (FM) nutrition intervention (n=72) or Bring Good Mood (BGM) social support control group (n=72). Both arms will be provided with 6 group sessions over an 8-week period. FM involves improving diet quality by applying strength-based behavioral nutrition counseling and activities facilitated by a registered dietitian. The control arm comprises a befriending protocol. During the interventions, all participants will continue their treatment for depression as usual. Longitudinal data are collected at baseline, at 8 weeks, and at 6- and 12-month follow-ups. Depressive symptoms, diet quality, eating behavior, ability to work and function, and quality of life are assessed by self-reported questionnaires. A treatment expectancy questionnaire will be administered at baseline and an acceptability questionnaire at 8 weeks. The Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale is used as the primary endpoint at 1 year. The results will be analyzed with linear mixed-effects models. Economic evaluation includes both cost-effectiveness and cost-utility analysis. Two incremental cost-effectiveness ratios will be calculated to evaluate the incremental cost per QALY and the incremental cost per improvement in CES-D. DISCUSSION: If the intervention proves to be cost-effective and acceptable, it be can be implemented in healthcare to support the treatment of depression.

18166,Two-dose varicella vaccine effectiveness in China: a meta-analysis and evidence quality assessment,2021-06-09,"BACKGROUND: The economic consequences of abortion care and abortion policies for individuals occur directly and indirectly. We lack synthesis of the economic costs, impacts, benefit or value of abortion care at the micro-level (i.e., individuals and households). This scoping review examines the microeconomic costs, benefits and consequences of abortion care and policies. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Searches were conducted in eight electronic databases and applied inclusion/exclusion criteria using the PRISMA extension for Scoping Reviews. For inclusion, studies must have examined at least one of the following outcomes: costs, impacts, benefits, and value of abortion care or abortion policies. Quantitative and qualitative data were extracted for descriptive statistics and thematic analysis. Of the 230 included microeconomic studies, costs are the most frequently reported microeconomic outcome (n = 180), followed by impacts (n = 84), benefits (n = 39), and values (n = 26). Individual-level costs of abortion-related care have implications for the timing and type of care sought, globally. In contexts requiring multiple referrals or follow-up visits, these costs are multiplied. The ways in which people pay for abortion-related costs are diverse. The intersection between micro-level costs and delay(s) to abortion-related care is substantial. Individuals forego other costs and expenditures, or are pushed further into debt and/or poverty, in order to fund abortion-related care. The evidence base on the economic impacts of policy or law change is from high-income countries, dominated by studies from the United States. CONCLUSIONS: Delays underpinned by economic factors can thwart care-seeking, affect the type of care sought, and impact the gestational age at which care is sought or reached. The evidence base includes little evidence on the micro-level costs for adolescents. Specific sub-groups of abortion care-seekers (transgendered and/or disabled people) are absent from the evidence and it is likely that they may experience higher direct and indirect costs because they may experience greater barriers to abortion care.","Coast, Ernestina; Lattof, Samantha R.; van der Meulen Rodgers, Yana; Moore, Brittany; Poss, Cheri",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8189560/,416

20169,A five-component infection control bundle to permanently eliminate a carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii spreading in an intensive care unit,2021-08-19,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Novel noninvasive measures of vascular function are emerging as subclinical markers for cardiovascular disease (CVD) and may be useful to predict CVD events. The purpose of our prospective study was to assess associations between digital peripheral arterial tonometry (PAT) measures and first-onset major CVD events in a sample of FHS (Framingham Heart Study) participants. METHODS: Using a fingertip PAT device, we assessed pulse amplitude in Framingham Offspring and Third Generation participants (n=3865; mean age, 55±14 years; 52% women) at baseline and in 30-second intervals for 4 minutes during reactive hyperemia. The PAT ratio (relative hyperemia index) was calculated as the post-to-pre occlusion pulse signal ratio in the occluded arm, relative to the same ratio in the control (nonoccluded) arm, and corrected for baseline vascular tone. Baseline pulse amplitude and PAT ratio during hyperemia are measures of pressure pulsatility and microvascular function in the finger, respectively. We used Cox proportional hazards regression to relate PAT measures in the fingertip to incident CVD events. RESULTS: During follow-up (median, 9.2 years; range, 0.04–10.0 years), 270 participants (7%) experienced new-onset CVD events (n=270). In multivariable models adjusted for cardiovascular risk factors, baseline pulse amplitude (hazard ratio [HR] per 1 SD, 1.04 [95% CI, 0.90–1.21]; P=0.57) and PAT ratio (HR, 0.95 [95% CI, 0.84–1.08]; P=0.43) were not significantly related to incident composite CVD events, including myocardial infarction or heart failure. However, higher PAT ratio (HR, 0.76 [95% CI, 0.61–0.94]; P=0.013), but not baseline pulse amplitude (HR, 1.15 [95% CI, 0.89–1.49]; P=0.29), was related to lower risk for incident stroke. In a sensitivity analysis by stroke subtype, higher PAT ratio was related to lower risk of incident ischemic stroke events (HR, 0.68 [95% CI, 0.53–0.86]; P=0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Novel digital PAT measures may represent a marker of stroke risk in the community.","Cooper, Leroy L.; Wang, Na; Beiser, Alexa S.; Romero, José Rafael; Aparicio, Hugo J.; Lioutas, Vasileios-Arsenios; Benjamin, Emelia J.; Larson, Martin G.; Vasan, Ramachandran S.; Mitchell, Gary F.; Seshadri, Sudha; Hamburg, Naomi M.",Stroke,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8378441/,416

We introduce a methodology and a tool, Scam-V, to validate observational models for modern computer architectures. We combine symbolic execution, relational analysis, and different program generation techniques to generate experiments and validate the models. An experiment consists of a randomly generated program together with two inputs that are observationally equivalent according to the model under the test. Validation is done by checking indistinguishability of the two inputs on real hardware by executing the program and analyzing the side channel. We have evaluated our framework by validating models that abstract the data-cache side channel of a Raspberry Pi 3 board with a processor implementing the ARMv8-A architecture. Our results show that Scam-V can identify bugs in the implementation of the models and generate test programs which invalidate the models due to hidden microarchitectural behavior.","Nemati, Hamed; Buiras, Pablo; Lindner, Andreas; Guanciale, Roberto; Jacobs, Swen",Computer Aided Verification,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7363228/,416

42116,Risk factors associated with death in infants <120 days old with severe pertussis: a case-control study,2020-11-16,"BACKGROUND: Atraumatic Restorative Treatment (ART) and the Hall Technique (HT) are both minimally invasive, non-aerosol generating procedures (non-AGPs). They seem to have never been directly compared, nor has the HT been studied in a non-clinical setting. This study compared the HT and ART restorations placed in a school setting after 36 months. METHODS: Children (5–10 yo) who had a primary molar with a dentinal occluso-proximal, cavitated carious lesion were allocated to the ART (selective removal) or HT arms. Primary outcome: restoration survival over 36-months (using Kaplan–Meier survival analysis, log rank test, and Cox regression). Secondary outcomes: (1) occlusal vertical dimension (OVD) (1, 2, 3, 4 weeks) and (2) child self-reported discomfort; (3) treatment acceptability (immediately following interventions); (4) Child Oral Health Related Quality of Life (OHRQoL), before treatment and after 6 months and (5) a post hoc analysis of time to tooth exfoliation (1, 6, 12, 18, 24, 30, 36 months). RESULTS: One-hundred and thirty-one children (ART = 65; HT = 66) were included (mean age = 8.1 ± 1.2). At 36 months, 112 (85.5%) children were followed-up. Primary outcome: restoration survival rates ART = 32.7% (SE = 0.08; 95% CI 0.17–0.47); HT = 93.4% (0.05; 0.72–0.99), p < 0.001; Secondary outcomes: (1) OVD returned to pre-treatment state within 4 weeks; (2) treatment discomfort was higher for the HT (p = 0.018); (3) over 70% of children and parents showed a high acceptability for treatments, with crown aesthetics being a concern for around 23% of parents; (4) Child OHRQoL improved after 6 months; and (5) teeth treated with the HT exfoliated earlier than those in the ART group (p = 0.007). CONCLUSIONS: Both ART and the HT were acceptable to child participants and their parents and all parents thought both restorations protected their child’s tooth. However, the crown appearance concerned almost a quarter of parents in the HT arm. Children experienced less discomfort in the ART group. Although both treatments can be performed in a non-clinical setting and have the advantage of being non-aerosol generating procedures (non-AGPs), the HT had almost three times higher survival rates (93.4%) for restoring primary molar occluso-proximal cavities compared to ART (32.7%).

44151,360. A Case Control Study of COVID-19 in Patients with End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD),2020-12-31,"BACKGROUND: Correct personal protective equipment (PPE) use is key to prevent infection. Observations on a single unit at the Veterans Affairs (VA) Tennessee Valley Healthcare System (TVHS) prior to COVID-19 (October 2019-February 2020) showed low rates of correct PPE use among healthcare workers (HCWs) (Figure 1). In response to the COVID-19 epidemic, the VA implemented new PPE protocols. Based on our initial observations, we were concerned that incorrect use of PPE may increase the risk of COVID-19 exposure among HCWs. Resident physicians, who work at many sites, may be at high-risk for incorrect PPE use due to rapid turnover and limited site-specific PPE training. We aimed to assess and improve COVID-19 PPE use among internal medicine residents rotating at the VA TVHS. Figure 1: Pre-COVID-19 Observations of Adherence to Contact Precaution Protocols at the Veterans Affairs Tennessee Valley Healthcare System [Image: see text] METHODS: We used the plan, do, study, act (PDSA) model. Prior to starting VA rotations, residents were emailed PPE education to review. We implemented a 1-hour video conference PPE protocol review at rotation start followed by in-person PPE use evaluations for residents performed by infectious diseases fellows on day 2 and day 5-6 post-review to provide just-in-time educational intervention. Errors at each PPE don/doff step were tracked. Correct PPE use data from both observations were compared using McNemar’s test. Baseline and post-implementation resident surveys assessed PPE use knowledge and comfort. RESULTS: Pre-implementation survey response rate was 72% (21/29); 19/21(91%) reported knowing which PPE to use and 16/21(76%) reported knowing how to safely don/doff PPE. Twenty of 29 (69%) residents completed both observations. Errors decreased by 55% (p=0.0045) from 17/20 (85%) to 6/20 (30%) between initial and follow up observations. Errors in hand hygiene, inclusion of all donning/doffing steps, and PPE reuse decreased, but PPE don/doff order errors increased (Figure 2). Post-project survey response rate was 16/29 (55%). All 16 reported knowing which PPE to use and how to safely don/doff PPE, and 11/16 (69%) residents felt both online and in-person interventions were helpful. Figure 2: COVID-19 PPE Errors and Correction Types by Observation [Image: see text] CONCLUSION: Correct COVID-19 PPE use is essential to protect HCWs and patients.

We studied disruptions and restorations of health and nutrition services by frontline workers (FLWs) in India during COVID-19. METHODS: We conducted phone surveys with 5500 FLWs in seven states between August–October 2020, asking about service delivery during April 2020 (T1) and in the August-October period (T2) and analyzed changes between T1 and T2. We also analyzed publicly available administrative data (AD) from 704 districts including the pre-pandemic period (T0) to examine disruptions and restoration of services. RESULTS: Phone surveys suggest, in T1, opening of village centers, fixed day events, growth monitoring, and immunization services was <50% in several states. In T2, restorations of center-based services were seen, with increases of >33% in >= 3 states. Food supplementation was least disrupted both in T1 and T2. AD highlights geographic variability both in disruptions in T1 compared to T0 and restorations in T2. FLWs’ adaptations to ensure service provision included home delivery (60 to 96%), ensuring physical distancing (33 to 86%), coordinating with other FLWs (7 to 49%), and using phone (∼2 to 65%). Challenges included personal fears, walking long distances, and beneficiaries’ non-cooperation. CONCLUSIONS: Services to mothers and children were disrupted during lockdown and restored thereafter. Rapid policy guidance and local adaptations by a strong cadre of FLWs likely enabled service resumption. However, gaps remain, and more research is needed on use of services by clients.

One obtained stationary phase (SilprAprImCl) was derived from direct reaction between N-(3-aminopropyl)-imidazole and 3-chloropropylated silica gel. Other two materials (SilprAprImBF4 and SilprAprImTf2N) were obtained from SilprAprImCl by ion exchange reaction, respectively. Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy and elemental analysis afforded the proofs of successful imidazolium immobilization and satisfied bonding efficiency. Various polar compounds such as saccharides, nucleosides, and nucleobases were utilized to evaluate the retention behaviours of these materials in HILIC mode. Different effects from mobile composition, column temperature, imidazolium unite and paired anions (Cl-, BF4-, and Tf2N-) in imidazolium were proved and discussed. Separation mechanism and the role of the imidazolium ions were also investigated in mobile phases with different pH. Moreover, chromatographic stability was evaluated by consecutive injections. Finally, the reliability of these stationary phases was demonstrated by the separation of oligosaccharides in real fructooligosaccharides samples.","Guo, Dandan; Yang, Chenxi; Qiu, Ruchen; Huang, Shaohua",Journal of chromatography.

However, the loss of triangulation must be overcome before the technique can be popularized. This study reports the first 100 laparoscopic total extraperitoneal hernia repairs using a single incision. The study cohort comprised 68 patients with a mean age of 44 (range, 18 to 83): 36 unilateral and 32 bilateral hernias. Twelve patients also underwent umbilical hernia repair with the Ventralex patch requiring no additional incisions. A 2.5-cm to 3-cm crescentic incision within the confines of the umbilicus was performed. Standard dissecting instruments and 52-cm/5.5-mm/30(0) laparoscope were used. Operation times were 50 minutes for unilateral and 80 minutes for bilateral. There was one conversion to conventional 3-port laparoscopic repair and none to open surgery. Outpatient surgery was achieved in all (except one). Analgesic requirements were minimal: 8 Dextropropoxyphene tablets (range, 0 to 20). There were no intraoperative or postoperative complications with a high patient satisfaction score. Single-incision laparoscopic hernia repair is safe and efficient simply by modifying dissection techniques (so-called ""inline"" and ""vertical""). Comparable success can be obtained while negating the risks of bowel and vascular injuries from sharp trocars and achieving improved cosmetic results.","Tran, Hanh",JSLS : Journal of the Society of Laparoendoscopic Surgeons,https://doi.org/10.4293/108680811x13022985131174; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21902942/,416

Five turkey breeder flocks were selected. Faecal samples were collected from all flocks at 1 week of age and then every other week until the poults reached 9 weeks of age. The faecal samples were pooled in groups of five. Of the 193 pools (""samples"") tested by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, 47.2%, 30.6%, and 10.4% samples were positive for astrovirus, rotavirus, and reovirus, respectively. No coronavirus was detected in any of the samples. Overall, 118 (61.1%) samples were positive for one or more enteric viruses. Of the 118 samples, 70 (59.3%) were positive for a single virus and 48 (40.7%) for a combination of viruses. Phylogenetic analysis based on the polymerase gene showed that astroviruses clustered into two groups with sequence homology ranging from 85.6 to 100% at the nucleotide level. Based on NSP4 gene sequences, rotaviruses clustered in a group and had 96.3 to 99.9% sequence homology at the nucleotide level. The reoviruses, based on their S4 gene sequences, clustered in a single group with sequence homology of 96.9 to 100%. Differing amino acid sequences of all three viruses may affect the antigenicity and/or pathogenicity of these viruses and may merit further study.

This method has substantial advantages over three-dimensional molecular tracking methods based upon charge-coupled device cameras, including increased Z-tracking range (10 μm demonstrated here), substantially lower excitation powers (15 μW used here), and the ability to perform time-resolved spectroscopy (such as fluorescence lifetime measurements or fluorescence correlation spectroscopy) on the molecules being tracked. In particular, we show for the first time fluorescence photon antibunching of individual QD labeled proteins in live cells and demonstrate the ability to track individual dye-labeled nucleotides (Cy5-dUTP) at biologically relevant transport rates. To demonstrate the power of these methods for exploring the spatiotemporal dynamics of live cells, we follow individual QD-labeled IgE-FcεRI receptors both on and inside rat mast cells. Trajectories of receptors on the plasma membrane reveal three-dimensional, nanoscale features of the cell surface topology. During later stages of the signal transduction cascade, clusters of QD labeled IgE-FcεRI were captured in the act of ligand-mediated endocytosis and tracked during rapid (~950 nm/s) vesicular transit through the cell.","Wells, Nathan P; Lessard, Guillaume A; Goodwin, Peter M; Phipps, Mary E; Cutler, Patrick J; Lidke, Diane S; Wilson, Bridget S; Werner, James H",Nano letters,https://doi.org/10.1021/nl103247v; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20957984/,416

Neutrophils infiltrate BP skin lesions, however, their role in immune dysregulation remains unclear. We investigated whether BP involves aberrant neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) formation in skin lesions and circulation; and examined the triggers and deleterious immuno-inflammatory consequences. In the present study, we found that circulating NET-related biomarker levels increased in serum and blister fluid of BP patients and significantly correlated with disease severity. Additionally, circulating neutrophils from BP patients displayed enhanced spontaneous NETs formation than healthy controls. In vitro, BP180-NC16A immune complexes-induced NETosis in neutrophils from BP patients, which was abrogated by Fcγ receptor and/or NADPH pathway blockade. Furthermore, the elevated levels of NETs from BP patients boosted autoantibody production by inducing B-cell differentiation into plasma cells, mediated by MAPK P38 cascade activation. Together, our findings provide strong evidence that NETs are involved in a pathogenic loop, causing excessive differentiation of B cells and promotion of autoantibody production. Hence, targeting aberrant neutrophil responses will provide novel potential targets for the treatment of BP.","Fang, Hui; Shao, Shuai; Xue, Ke; Yuan, Xu; Qiao, Pei; Zhang, Jieyu; Cao, Tianyu; Luo, Yixin; Bai, Xiaocui; Li, Wenjing; Li, Caixia; Qiao, Hongjiang; Dang, Erle; Wang, Gang",FASEB journal : official publication of the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology,https://doi.org/10.1096/fj.202100145r; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34151465/,416
71886,Response to: 'Hydroxychloroquine ineffective for COVID-19 prophylaxis in lupus and rheumatoid arthritis' by Singer et al.,2020-08-05,"BACKGROUND SARS-CoV-2 caused one of the most devastating pandemics in the recent history of mankind. Due to various countermeasures, including lock-downs, wearing masks and increased hygiene, the virus has been controlled in some parts of the world. More recently, the availability of vaccines, based on RNA or Adenoviruses, have greatly added to our ability to keep the virus at bay; again, however, in some parts of the world only. While available vaccines are effective, it would be desirable to also have more classical vaccines at hand for the future. Key feature of vaccines for long-term control of SARS-CoV-2 would be inexpensive production at large scale, ability to make multiple booster injections and long-term stability at 4°C. METHODS Here we describe such a vaccine candidate, consisting of the SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding motif grafted genetically onto the surface of the immunologically optimized cucumber mosaic virus, called CuMVTT -RBM. RESULTS Using bacterial fermentation and continuous flow centrifugation for purification, the productivity of the production process is estimated to be >2.5 million doses per 1000-liter fermenter run. We demonstrate that the candidate vaccine is highly immunogenic in mice and rabbits and induces more high avidity antibodies compared to convalescent human sera, and antibodies induced are more cross-reactive to mutant RBDs for variants of concern (VOC). Furthermore, antibody responses are neutralizing and long-lived. In addition, the vaccine candidate was stable for at least 14 months at 4°C CONCLUSION: Thus, the here presented VLP-based vaccine may be a good candidate for use as conventional vaccine in the long-term.","Mohsen, Mona O; Balke, Ina; Zinkhan, Simon; Zeltina, Villija; Liu, Xuelan; Chang, Xinyue; Krenger, Pascal S; Plattner, Kevin; Gharailoo, Zahra; Vogt, Anne-Cathrine S; Augusto, Gilles; Zwicker, Marianne; Roongta, Salony; Rothen, Dominik A; Josi, Romano; da Costa, Joana J; Sobczak, Jan M; Nonic, Aleksandra; Brand, Lee-Anne; Nuss, Katja; Martina, Byron; Speiser, Daniel E; Kündig, Thomas; Jennings, Gary T; Walton, Senta M; Vogel, Monique; Zeltins, Andris; Bachmann, Martin F",Allergy,https://doi.org/10.1111/all.15080; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34496033/,416

We therefore report the validation of the DeLit Trial insulin infusion algorithm. METHODS Patients scheduled for major noncardiac surgery were randomized to a target intraoperative blood glucose concentration of 4.4-6.1 mmoL·L(-1) (80-110 mg·dL(-1)) intensive group or 10-11.1 mmoL·L(-1) (180-200 mg·dL(-1)) conventional group. Glucose was managed with a dynamic intravenous insulin infusion algorithm. We compared the randomized groups on glucose time-weighted average (TWA), proportion of time spent within target, number of severe (< 2.2 mmoL·L(-1) or < 40 mg·dL(-1)) or moderate (< 2.8 mmoL·L(-1) or < 50 mg·dL(-1)) hypoglycemic episodes, and within-patient variability in glucose concentrations expressed as standard deviation from the patient mean. RESULTS One hundred eighty-seven patients were assigned to intensive glucose control, and 177 patients were assigned to conventional glucose control. Median (lower quartile value [Q1], upper quartile value [Q3]) of intraoperative TWA for the intensive vs conventional groups was 6 [5.6, 6.7] mmoL·L(-1) vs 7.7 [6.9, 9.2] mmoL·L(-1), respectively; P < 0.001. The intensive group spent 49% (29, 71) of the time within target, substantially more time than the conventional group spent either within the intensive target or within its own target (both P < 0.001). The intensive group had slightly lower within-patient glucose variability than the conventional group (0.9 [0.7, 1.3] mmoL·L(-1) vs 1.3 [0.8, 1.8] mmoL·L(-1), respectively; P < 0.001). Three patients had moderate hypoglycemia (intensive group), but none experienced severe episodes. CONCLUSION Tight intraoperative glucose control in noncardiac surgery can be maintained successfully without serious hypoglycemic episodes.

The process, which first began in the United States and Canada, has now been implemented in numerous countries throughout the world, and often each geographic region or country develops locally specific recommendations. It is interesting to realize that guidelines from different regions often interpret the same evidence base differently, and guidelines differ from one country to another, even though the bacteriology of CAP is often more similar than different from one region to another. One of the unique contributions of the 2007 US guidelines is the inclusion of quality and performance measures. In addition, US guidelines emphasize management principles that differ from some of the principles in European guidelines because of unique epidemiological considerations. In addition, certain therapy principles apply in the United States that differ from those in other regions, including the need for all patients to receive routine therapy for atypical pathogens, the emergence of community-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus in some patients following influenza, and the need for all patients admitted to the intensive care unit to receive at least two antimicrobial agents. In the future, as guidelines evolve, there will be an important place for regional guidelines, particularly if these guidelines can recommend locally specific strategies to implement guidelines, which if successful, can lead to improved patient outcomes.","Niederman, Michael S; Luna, Carlos M",Seminars in respiratory and critical care medicine,https://doi.org/10.1055/s-0032-1315642; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22718216/,416

With this rapidly expanding number of websites, critical appraisal is needed to identify quality websites. The last major review of critical care websites was published in 2011, and thus a new review of the websites relevant to the critical care clinician is necessary. METHODS: A new assessment tool for evaluating critical care medicine education websites, the Critical Care Medical Education Website Quality Evaluation Tool (CCMEWQET), was modified from existing tools. A PubMed and Startpage search from 2007 to 2017 was conducted to identify websites relevant to critical care medicine education. These websites were scored based on the CCMEWQET. RESULTS: Ninety-seven websites relevant for critical care medicine education were identified and scored, and the top ten websites were described in detail. Common types of resources available on these websites included blog posts, podcasts, videos, online journal clubs, and interactive components such as quizzes. Almost one quarter of websites (n = 22) classified themselves as FOAM websites. The top ten websites most often included an editorial process, high-quality and appropriately attributed graphics and multimedia, scored much higher for comprehensiveness and ease of access, and included opportunities for interactive learning. CONCLUSION: Many excellent online resources for critical care medicine education currently exist, and the number is likely to continue to increase. Opportunities for improvement in many websites include more active engagement of learners, upgrading navigation abilities, incorporating an editorial process, and providing appropriate attribution for graphics and media.","Wolbrink, Traci A; Rubin, Lucy; Burns, Jeffrey P; Markovitz, Barry",Journal of intensive care medicine,https://doi.org/10.1177/0885066618759287; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29519206/,416

The aim of our study, carried out on 51 patients, was to assess the effectiveness of thoracic paravertebral block (TPVB) associated with GA, or as a sole anesthesiological technique for postoperative pain control and for the reduction of intra and postoperative opioids consumption. Materials and methods Fifty-one patients with neoplastic breast disease and elected as candidates for radical mastectomy were included in the study. The primary outcomes for this study were intra and postoperative opioid consumption and postoperative pain intensity. In 37 patients, TPVB was associated with GA while in 14 patients it was used as the sole anesthesiological technique. Data are reported as mean with standard deviation median with interquartile range, number, and percentage, depending on the underlying distribution. Results We did not use intra or postoperative opioids for any patient and the Numeric Rate Scale, assessed at time 0, at the end of the surgery, and 2, 6, 12, and 24 hrs after surgery, was >3 in seven patients only. Conclusions This study aims to show how TPVB can be used to carry out radical mastectomy procedures so that intra and postoperative opioids use can be avoided. In our study, TPVB was used in total mastectomy procedures in association with GA or as the sole anesthesiological technique, without the intra and postoperative use of opioids and with a significant reduction of local anesthetic dosages compared to those reported in the existing literature.","Santonastaso, Domenico P; de Chiara, Annabella; Russo, Emanuele; Musetti, Giovanni; Lucchi, Leonardo; Sibilio, Andrea; Maltoni, Roberta; Gamberini, Emiliano; Fusari, Maurizio; Agnoletti, Vanni",Journal of pain research,https://doi.org/10.2147/jpr.s211944; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31571975/,416

Although RIG-I and MDA5 have similar molecular structures, these two receptors have distinct features during activation. Further, the signaling domains of the N terminal CARD domains (CARDs) in RIG-I and MDA5 share poor similarity. Therefore, we wonder whether the CARDs of RIG-I and MDA5 play similar roles in signaling and antiviral function. Here we expressed porcine RIG-I and MDA5 CARDs in 293T cells and porcine alveolar macrophages and found that MDA5 CARDs exhibit higher expression and stronger signaling activity than RIG-I CARDs. Nevertheless, both RIG-I and MDA5 CARDs exert comparable antiviral function against several viruses. Transcriptome analysis showed that MDA5 CARDs are more effective in regulating downstream genes. However, in the presence of virus, both RIG-I and MDA5 CARDs exhibit similar effects on downstream gene transcriptions, reflecting their antiviral function.","Li, Shuangjie; Shao, Qi; Zhu, Yuanyuan; Ji, Xingyu; Luo, Jia; Xu, Yulin; Liu, Xueliang; Zheng, Wanglong; Chen, Nanhua; Meurens, François; Zhu, Jianzhong",Frontiers in microbiology,https://doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2021.677634; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34177861/,416

We examined the accuracy of AI ECG for identification of LVSD (defined as LVEF ≤40% by transthoracic echocardiogram [TTE]) in cardiac intensive care unit (CICU) patients. METHOD We included unique Mayo Clinic CICU patients admitted from 2007 to 2018 who underwent AI-ECG and TTE within 7 days, at least one of which was during hospitalization. Discrimination of the AI-ECG for LVSD was determined using receiver-operator characteristic curve (AUC) values. RESULTS We included 5680 patients with a mean age of 68 ± 15 years (37% females). Acute coronary syndrome (ACS) was present in 55%. LVSD was present in 34% of patients (mean LVEF 48 ± 16%). The AI-ECG had an AUC of 0.83 (95% confidence interval 0.82-0.84) for discrimination of LVSD. Using the optimal cut-off, the AI-ECG had 73%, specificity 78%, negative predictive value 85% and overall accuracy 76% for LVSD. AUC values were higher for patients aged <70 years (0.85 versus 0.80), males (0.84 versus 0.79), patients without ACS (0.86 versus 0.80), and patients who did not undergo revascularization (0.84 versus 0.80). CONCLUSIONS The AI-ECG algorithm had very good discrimination for LVSD in this critically-ill CICU cohort with a high prevalence of LVSD.

89576,Adherence to medication in patients with rheumatic diseases during COVID-19 pandemic.,2020-09-07,"Many speech-language pathologists (SLPs) recently adopted a live, synchronous online distribution of clinical services due to physical distancing measures aimed at bringing the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak under control. Few SLPs had received training in telepractice to prepare them for changes from an in-person service delivery model to synchronous telepractice. The new telepractice environment may alter vocal behaviors and communication interactions in such a way that negatively impacts voice production. Thus, delivering synchronous online clinical services may require that SLPs adopt novel prevention strategies for avoiding phonogenic voice problems. Guided by two complementary injury frameworks, the Haddon Matrix and the Haddon Countermeasures, this article provides an overview of potential factors associated with phonogenic voice problems among SLPs in telepractice and proposes possible prevention strategies to maintain optimal vocal health and function with synchronous modes of online clinical practice.","Knickerbocker, Kristie; Bryan, Cara; Ziegler, Aaron",Seminars in speech and language,https://doi.org/10.1055/s-0040-1722754; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33596606/,416

90508,Autoimmune Hepatitis-Primary Biliary Cholangitis Overlap Syndrome Triggered by COVID-19.,2021,"Mutations in PTPN11, which encodes the protein tyrosine phosphatase SHP2, contribute to ∼35% of cases of juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML). A common clinical picture in children with JMML is that it presents as a constitutive hyperinflammatory syndrome, partially reminiscent of chronic myelomonocytic leukemia in adults. Thus, a component of JMML is associated with a hyperinflammatory state and abundant innate immune cells such as neutrophils and monocytes. Recently, we showed that the evolutionarily conserved mouse lncRNA Morrbid is specifically expressed in myeloid cells and uniquely represses the expression of the proapoptotic gene Bim to regulate the lifespan of myeloid cells. However, its role in JMML has not been investigated. In this study, we characterized the role of Morrbid and its target Bim, which are significantly dysregulated in Shp2E76K/+-bearing myeloid cells, in driving JMML. Loss of Morrbid in a mouse model of JMML driven by the Shp2E76K/+ mutation resulted in a significant correction of myeloid and erythroid cell abnormalities associated with JMML, including overall survival. Consistently, patients with JMML who had PTPN11, KRAS, and NRAS mutations and high expression of MORRBID manifested poor overall survival. Our results suggest that Morrbid contributes to JMML pathogenesis.","Cai, Zhigang; Zhang, Chi; Kotzin, Jonathan J; Williams, Adam; Henao-Mejia, Jorge; Kapur, Reuben",Blood advances,https://doi.org/10.1182/bloodadvances.2020002123; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32697817/,416
90689,Successful experience of coronavirus disease-2019 pneumonia in a renal-transplant recipient.,2020,"BACKGROUND Congregate settings have been disproportionately affected by coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Our objective was to compare testing for, diagnosis of and death after severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection across 3 settings (residents of long-term care homes, people living in shelters and the rest of the population). METHODS We conducted a population-based prospective cohort study involving individuals tested for SARS-CoV-2 in the Greater Toronto Area between Jan. 23, 2020, and May 20, 2020. We sourced person-level data from COVID-19 surveillance and reporting systems in Ontario. We calculated cumulatively diagnosed cases per capita, proportion tested, proportion tested positive and case-fatality proportion for each setting. We estimated the age- and sex-adjusted rate ratios associated with setting for test positivity and case fatality using quasi-Poisson regression. RESULTS Over the study period, a total of 173 092 individuals were tested for and 16 490 individuals were diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection. We observed a shift in the proportion of cumulative cases from all cases being related to travel to cases in residents of long-term care homes (20.4% [3368/16 490]), shelters (2.3% [372/16 490]), other congregate settings (20.9% [3446/16 490]) and community settings (35.4% [5834/16 490]), with cumulative travel-related cases at 4.1% (674/16490). Cumulatively, compared with the rest of the population, the diagnosed cases per capita was 64-fold and 19-fold higher among long-term care home and shelter residents, respectively. By May 20, 2020, 76.3% (21 617/28 316) of long-term care home residents and 2.2% (150 077/6 808 890) of the rest of the population had been tested. After adjusting for age and sex, residents of long-term care homes were 2.4 (95% confidence interval [CI] 2.2-2.7) times more likely to test positive, and those who received a diagnosis of COVID-19 were 1.4-fold (95% CI 1.1-1.8) more likely to die than the rest of the population. INTERPRETATION Long-term care homes and shelters had disproportionate diagnosed cases per capita, and residents of long-term care homes diagnosed with COVID-19 had higher case fatality than the rest of the population. Heterogeneity across micro-epidemics among specific populations and settings may reflect underlying heterogeneity in transmission risks, necessitating setting-specific COVID-19 prevention and mitigation strategies.","Wang, Linwei; Ma, Huiting; Yiu, Kristy C Y; Calzavara, Andrew; Landsman, David; Luong, Linh; Chan, Adrienne K; Kustra, Rafal; Kwong, Jeffrey C; Boily, Marie-Claude; Hwang, Stephen; Straus, Sharon; Baral, Stefan D; Mishra, Sharmistha",CMAJ open,https://doi.org/10.9778/cmajo.20200213; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33037070/,416

Recently, biological network-based approaches have been proven to be effective in predicting chemical-gene interactions. RESULTS We present CGINet, a graph convolutional network-based method for identifying chemical-gene interactions in an integrated multi-relational graph containing three types of nodes: chemicals, genes, and pathways. We investigate two different perspectives on learning node embeddings. One is to view the graph as a whole, and the other is to adopt a subgraph view that initial node embeddings are learned from the binary association subgraphs and then transferred to the multi-interaction subgraph for more focused learning of higher-level target node representations. Besides, we reconstruct the topological structures of target nodes with the latent links captured by the designed substructures. CGINet adopts an end-to-end way that the encoder and the decoder are trained jointly with known chemical-gene interactions. We aim to predict unknown but potential associations between chemicals and genes as well as their interaction types. CONCLUSIONS We study three model implementations CGINet-1/2/3 with various components and compare them with baseline approaches. As the experimental results suggest, our models exhibit competitive performances on identifying chemical-gene interactions. Besides, the subgraph perspective and the latent link both play positive roles in learning much more informative node embeddings and can lead to improved prediction.","Wang, Wei; Yang, Xi; Wu, Chengkun; Yang, Canqun",BMC bioinformatics,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12859-020-03899-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33243142/,416

95586,Indicators of acute kidney injury as biomarkers to differentiate heatstroke from coronavirus disease 2019: A retrospective multicenter analysis.,2020-08-31,"BACKGROUND Prostate cancer can be treated with several different modalities, including radiation treatment. Various prognostic tools have been developed to aid decision making by providing estimates of the probability of different outcomes. Such tools have been demonstrated to have better prognostic accuracy than clinical judgment alone. METHODS A systematic review was undertaken to identify papers relating to the prediction of clinical outcomes (biochemical failure, metastasis, survival) in patients with prostate cancer who received radiation treatment, with the particular aim of identifying whether published tools are adequately developed, validated, and provide accurate predictions. PubMed and EMBASE were searched from July 2007. Title and abstract screening, full text review, and critical appraisal were conducted by two reviewers. A review protocol was published in advance of commencing literature searches. RESULTS The search strategy resulted in 165 potential articles, of which 72 were selected for full text review and 47 ultimately included. These papers described 66 models which were newly developed and 31 which were external validations of already published predictive tools. The included studies represented a total of 60,457 patients, recruited between 1984 and 2009. Sixty five percent of models were not externally validated, 57% did not report accuracy and 31% included variables which are not readily accessible in existing datasets. Most models (72, 74%) related to external beam radiation therapy with the remainder relating to brachytherapy (alone or in combination with external beam radiation therapy). CONCLUSIONS A large number of prognostic models (97) have been described in the recent literature, representing a rapid increase since previous reviews (17 papers, 1966-2007). Most models described were not validated and a third utilised variables which are not readily accessible in existing data collections. Where validation had occurred, it was often limited to data taken from single institutes in the US. While validated and accurate models are available to predict prostate cancer specific mortality following external beam radiation therapy, there is a scarcity of such tools relating to brachytherapy. This review provides an accessible catalogue of predictive tools for current use and which should be prioritised for future validation.","Raymond, Elspeth; O'Callaghan, Michael E; Campbell, Jared; Vincent, Andrew D; Beckmann, Kerri; Roder, David; Evans, Sue; McNeil, John; Millar, Jeremy; Zalcberg, John; Borg, Martin; Moretti, Kim",Radiation oncology,https://doi.org/10.1186/s13014-017-0786-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28327203/,416

METHODS This twin-center prospective study assessed major tympanomastoid surgery patients over a 6-month period. Patients were assessed postoperatively on Day 0 or Day 1 of surgery using a standardized proforma. A Weber's test was performed using a 512-Hz tuning fork, placed midline on the forehead to assess the direction of sound localization. This was directly compared with a scratch test, by asking the patient the following while scratching the head bandage in the midline: ""Can you hear this? And which side is loudest?"" RESULTS Fifty-six patients were assessed in total. Sixteen mastoid explorations, 14 tympanoplasties, 18 combined approach tympanoplasties, and 8 other procedures were included, all of which had standard external auditory canal packing and head bandage. Assessment with Weber's test found 41 patients to have sound lateralizing to the operated ear. In comparison, 50 patients lateralized sound to the operated ear with the scratch test. Overall, Weber's test had a sensitivity of 73.2% and specificity of 100% compared with a sensitivity of 89.3% and specificity of 100% for the ""Scratch Test."" No patients had a dead ear after surgery. CONCLUSION The scratch test proved to be more accurate than traditional postoperative tuning fork assessment and provides a quick, accurate, and simple solution for when such equipment is unavailable.","Iacovidou, Aphrodite; Giblett, Neil; Doshi, Jayesh; Jindal, Mundit","Otology & neurotology : official publication of the American Otological Society, American Neurotology Society [and] European Academy of Otology and Neurotology",https://doi.org/10.1097/mao.0000000000000357; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24643030/,416

However, the deployment of the self-gripping mesh is challenging due to its adhesive property. The purpose of this study was to introduce and describe an easy self-gripping mesh deployment method in laparoscopic inguinal hernia repair. METHODS The self-gripping mesh was folded bilaterally towards the center of the mesh and placed vertically to align with the inferior epigastric artery, centered on the internal defect, then unfolded in a horizontal-bilateral unfolding method, first laterally, then medially. RESULTS A total of 63 inguinal hernias were repaired laparoscopicly: 40 patients by TAPP or TEP technique with self-gripping mesh, and there were no perioperative complications. The average time of mesh placement was 186 s (45-250 s). The patients only feel minimal pain (less than VAS 3) the second postoperative morning, and most of the patients were discharged the next day postoperatively; the average postoperative hospital duration was 1 day (1-2 days).

The vascular biomaterial must support cell growth, be non-thrombogenic, minimize intimal hyperplasia, match the structural properties of native vessels, and allow for regeneration of arterial tissue. Electrospun recombinant human tropoelastin (rTE) as a medial component of a vascular graft scaffold was investigated in this study by evaluating its structural properties, as well as its ability to support primary smooth muscle cell adhesion and growth. rTE solutions of 9, 15, and 20 wt% were electrospun into sheets with average fiber diameters of 167 ± 32, 522 ± 67, and 735 ± 270 nm, and average pore sizes of 0.4 ± 0.1, 5.8 ± 4.3, and 4.9 ± 2.4 µm, respectively. Electrospun rTE fibers were cross-linked with disuccinimidyl suberate to produce an insoluble fibrous polymeric recombinant tropoelastin (prTE) biomaterial. Smooth muscle cells attached via integrin binding to the rTE coatings and proliferated on prTE biomaterials at a comparable rate to growth on prTE coated glass, glass alone, and tissue culture plastic.

METHODS A multidisciplinary team developed a database and user interfaces for Android and iOS operating systems. Branching logic and discrete fields were created to streamline provider data input. One hundred patients were randomly selected from the first four months of data collection (February to June 2015). Patients were limited to those undergoing anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction, meniscal repair, partial meniscectomy, or a combination of these procedures. Duplicate data on these 100 patients were collected through chart review. These two data sets were compared. Cohen's kappa statistic was used to assess agreement. RESULTS The database and smartphone data capture tool show almost perfect agreement (kappa > 0.81) for all data tested. In addition, data are more comprehensive with near-perfect provider completion (100% for all data tested). Furthermore, provider data entry is extremely efficient (median 151-second completion time).

However, there is a need to identify best practices in the use of digital technologies to effectively reach, support, and manage care for patients living with SMDs. In this review, we summarize recent studies using digital technology to manage symptoms and support clinical care for this patient population and discuss new opportunities to advance digital psychiatry research and practice in LMICs. RECENT FINDINGS Studies evaluating digital interventions for clinical populations living with SMDs in LMICs are limited. Yet, across recent articles surveyed, digital technology appears to yield diverse benefits for this at-risk patient population. These benefits include improved medication adherence, appointment adherence, reduced instances of relapse, and fewer re-hospitalizations. SUMMARY Continued rigorous research evaluating effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of digital technologies in reaching, treating, and managing symptoms and supporting clinical care for patients with SMDs in LMICs is vital. The urgency for remote approaches for delivering specialized psychiatric care is particularly pronounced because of the immediate and long-term impact of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic on access to in-person services. Future research should emphasize participatory approaches rooted in a process of codesign with target users, in order to achieve clinically effective remotely delivered digital mental health interventions.","Merchant, Rutvij; Torous, John; Rodriguez-Villa, Elena; Naslund, John A",Current opinion in psychiatry,https://doi.org/10.1097/yco.0000000000000626; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32520747/,416

Here, we have developed a simple mass spectrometry assay for SARS-CoV-2 in nasopharyngeal swab samples using common laboratory reagents. The method employs high sensitivity and selectivity targeted mass spectrometry detection, monitoring nine constitutive peptides representative of the three main viral proteins and a straightforward pellet digestion protocol for convenient routine applications. Absolute quantification of N, M, and S proteins was achieved by addition of isotope-labeled versions of best peptides. Limit of detection, recovery, precision, and linearity were thoroughly evaluated in four representative viral transport media (VTM) containing distinct total protein content. The protocol was sensitive in all swab media with limit of detection determined at 2 × 103 pfu/mL, corresponding to as low as 30 pfu injected into the LC-MS/MS system. When tested on VTM-stored nasopharyngeal swab samples from positive and control patients, sensitivity was similar to or better than rapid immunoassay dipsticks, revealing a corresponding RT-PCR detection threshold at Ct ∼ 24. The study represents the first thorough evaluation of sensitivity and robustness of targeted mass spectrometry in nasal swabs, constituting a promising SARS-CoV-2 antigen assay for the first-line diagnosis of COVID-19 and compatible with the constraints of clinical settings.

The objective of this study was to describe the association between neighborhood factors and number of COVID-19 cases. We hypothesized an association between disadvantaged neighborhoods and clusters of COVID-19 cases. METHODS We analyzed data on patients presenting to a large health care system in Boston during February 5-May 4, 2020. We used a bivariate local join-count procedure to determine colocation between census tracts with high rates of neighborhood demographic characteristics (eg, Hispanic race/ethnicity) and measures of disadvantage (eg, health insurance status) and COVID-19 cases. We used negative binomial models to assess independent associations between neighborhood factors and the incidence of COVID-19. RESULTS A total of 9898 COVID-19 patients were in the cohort. The overall crude incidence in the study area was 32 cases per 10 000 population, and the adjusted incidence per census tract ranged from 2 to 405 per 10 000 population. We found significant colocation of several neighborhood factors and the top quintile of cases: percentage of population that was Hispanic, non-Hispanic Black, without health insurance, receiving Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits, and living in poverty. Factors associated with increased incidence of COVID-19 included percentage of population that is Hispanic (incidence rate ratio [IRR] = 1.25; 95% CI, 1.23-1.28) and percentage of households living in poverty (IRR = 1.25; 95% CI, 1.19-1.32). CONCLUSIONS We found a significant association between neighborhoods with high rates of disadvantage and COVID-19. Policy makers need to consider these health inequities when responding to the pandemic and planning for subsequent health needs.","Samuels-Kalow, Margaret E; Dorner, Stephen; Cash, Rebecca E; Dutta, Sayon; White, Benjamin; Ciccolo, Gia E; Brown, David F M; Camargo, Carlos A",Public health reports,https://doi.org/10.1177/00333549211002837; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33729070/,416

This operation poses several advantages over traditional anal excision, which include better visibility of the rectum, more precise border excision, and a lower recurrence rate of benign and stage T1 malignant neoplasms. Introducing a SILS™ port (Covidien) into the anal canal (originally developed for single-incision laparoscopic surgery), instead of the TEM proctoscope, may further enhance the technique. We performed excisions of rectal lesions in 3 patients using a SILS port in TEM. In all cases, it was easy to maintain the rectum insufflated, and the visibility was excellent. The rectal lesions were successfully resected without significant intraoperative complications. Postoperative recovery was uneventful in both cases. TEM with a SILS port is a promising technique that may provide several advantages over the traditional TEM, including cost-effectiveness, and can be easily implemented in the setting of a community hospital.","Matz, Jacob; Matz, Alexander",Journal of laparoendoscopic & advanced surgical techniques.

Here, we present a method for the generation of suspended lipid bilayers with physiological relevant lipid compositions on microstructured Si/SiO2 chips that allow for high-throughput screening of both membrane transport and viral membrane fusion. Simultaneous observation of hundreds of single-membrane channels yields statistical information revealing population heterogeneities of the pore assembly and conductance of the bacterial toxin α-hemolysin (αHL). The influence of lipid composition and ionic strength on αHL pore formation was investigated at the single-channel level, resolving features of the pore-assembly pathway. Pore formation is inhibited by a specific antibody, demonstrating the applicability of the platform for drug screening of bacterial toxins and cell-penetrating agents. Furthermore, fusion of H3N2 influenza viruses with suspended lipid bilayers can be observed directly using a specialized chip architecture. The presented micropore arrays are compatible with fluorescence readout from below using an air objective, thus allowing high-throughput screening of membrane transport in multiwell formats in analogy to plate readers.","Kusters, Ilja; van Oijen, Antoine M; Driessen, Arnold J M",ACS nano,https://doi.org/10.1021/nn405884a; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24601516/,416

We report our initial experience and the technical details of dual microcatheter coil embolizations that were applied in these difficult lesions. METHOD AND RESULTS Eighty-five small aneurysms (<7 mm) that exhibited difficult configurations, such as a wide neck or an important branch vessel arising from the fundus, were successfully treated using a dual microcatheter technique. The packing attenuation, adverse events during the procedures, and angiographic occlusions from 21 very small aneurysm (≤3 mm) were recorded and compared with our coiling results of 64 small aneurysms (>3 mm, <7 mm). There were no significant differences in intraprocedural ruptures or procedure-related thromboembolisms between the two groups. At the last post-procedure clinical follow-up, a good clinical outcome (an modified Rankin Scale (mRS) of 0-2) was observed in 18 of the patients (85.7%). The recanalization rates at follow-up were significantly lower in the very small aneurysm group compared to the small aneurysm group (p < 0.05) and the mean packing density in the very small aneurysm group was significantly higher compared to the small aneurysm group (35.2% vs 24.8%, p < 0.05). CONCLUSION The dual technique was feasible, safe, and effective for coil embolization of aneurysms with difficult configurations and, in particular, it provided an alternative option for treating very small aneurysms.","Yin, Long; Wei, Ming; Ren, Hecheng","Interventional neuroradiology : journal of peritherapeutic neuroradiology, surgical procedures and related neurosciences",https://doi.org/10.1177/1591019915622166; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26769734/,416

To achieve this goal, one strategy is to reduce the number of drugs in the antiretroviral regimen. AREAS COVERED We review the recent evidence on the efficacy and safety of reduced drug regimens and their potential risks and benefits. There is currently strong evidence showing that some two-drug regimens have a comparable efficacy and short-term safety compared to standard three-drug regimens. The fixed-dose combination of dolutegravir/lamivudine is already an alternative for many treatment-naïve and virologically suppressed HIV-1 infected adults supported by large randomized clinical trials. The co-formulation dolutegravir plus rilpivirine is also a switch strategy for maintenance therapy. Long-acting injectable cabotegravir plus rilpivirine has already regulatory approval, and islatravir plus doravirine is an expected option in the near future. Some two-drug regimens, especially those including maraviroc, have not been as successful. EXPERT OPINION Long-term safety issues of these two-drug regimens remain to be determined, but with the overwhelming evidence available in virological control and short-term safety compared to three-drug regimens, the potential benefits of some of these two-drug regimens appear to outweigh the risks.","Cadiñanos, Julen; Montejano, Rocio; de Miguel Buckley, Rosa; Marcelo, Cristina; Arribas, Jose R",Expert opinion on drug safety,https://doi.org/10.1080/14740338.2021.1887135; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33557651/,416
118421,"Response to: 'High dosage of Methylprednisolone as a rescue, second-line treatment in COVID-19 patients who failed to respond to Tocilizumab' by Conticini et al.",2020-08-19,"BACKGROUND Whole-body vibration (WBV) induces reflex muscle activity and leads to increased muscle strength. However, little is known about the physiological mechanisms underlying the effects of whole-body vibration on muscular performance. Tonic vibration reflex is the most commonly cited mechanism to explain the effects of whole-body vibration on muscular performance, although there is no conclusive evidence that tonic vibration reflex occurs. The bone myoregulation reflex is another neurological mechanism used to explain the effects of vibration on muscular performance. Bone myoregulation reflex is defined as a reflex mechanism in which osteocytes exposed to cyclic mechanical loading induce muscle activity. AIMS The aim of this study was to assess whether bone tissue affected vibration-induced reflex muscle activity and vibration-induced muscle strength gain. STUDY DESIGN A prospective, randomised, controlled, double-blind, parallel-group clinical trial. METHODS Thirty-four participants were randomised into two groups. High-magnitude whole-body vibration was applied in the exercise group, whereas low-magnitude whole-body vibration exercises were applied in the control group throughout 20 sessions. Hip bone mineral density, isokinetic muscle strength, and plasma sclerostin levels were measured. The surface electromyography data were processed to obtain the Root Mean Squares, which were normalised by maximal voluntarily contraction. RESULTS In the exercise group, muscle strength increased in the right and left knee flexors (23.9%, p=0.004 and 27.5%, p<0.0001, respectively). However, no significant change was observed in the knee extensor muscle strength. There was no significant change in the knee muscle strength in the control group. The vibration-induced corrected Root Mean Squares of the semitendinosus muscle was decreased by 2.8 times (p=0.005) in the exercise group, whereas there was no change in the control group. Sclerostin index was decreased by 15.2% (p=0.031) in the exercise group and increased by 20.8% (p=0.028) in the control group. A change in the sclerostin index was an important predictor of a change in the vibration-induced normalised Root Mean Square of the semitendinosus muscle (R2=0.7, p=0.0001). Femoral neck bone mineral density was an important predictor of muscle strength gain (R2=0.26, p=0.035). CONCLUSION This study indicates that bone tissue may have an effect on vibration-induced muscle strength gain and vibration-induced reflex muscle activity.

As in the case of vasculitis, an approach to mimics based on the anatomic size of vessels can be useful. Infections can mimic vasculitis of any vessel size, including the formation of aneurysms and induction of ANCAs. Genetic disorders and vasculopathies are important considerations in large and medium vessel vasculitis. Cholesterol emboli, thrombotic conditions and calciphylaxis typically affect the medium and small vessels and, like vasculitis, can cause cutaneous, renal and CNS manifestations. Reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome is important to distinguish from primary angiitis of the CNS. As an incorrect diagnosis of vasculitis can result in harmful consequences, it is imperative that the evaluation of suspected vasculitis includes consideration of mimics. We discuss the above mimics and outline a systematic and practical approach for differentiating vasculitis from its mimics.","Maningding, Ernest; Kermani, Tanaz A",Rheumatology,https://doi.org/10.1093/rheumatology/keaa495; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33167039/,416

It is uncertain whether the usual dietary intake of flavonoids may benefit patients with NAFLD. This study evaluated the association between the usual intake of total flavonoids and their subclasses and the risk of progression in NAFLD. The prospective study included 2694 adults from the Guangzhou Nutrition & Health Study. Face-to-face interviews using a 79-item food frequency questionnaire were administered to assess habitual dietary flavonoid intake, while abdominal ultrasonography was conducted to evaluate the presence and degree of NAFLD, with measurements conducted three years apart. After adjustment for potential confounders, higher flavonoid intakes were gradely associated with reduced risks of worsen NAFLD status. The relative risks (95% CI) of worsening (vs. non-worsening) NAFLD in the highest (vs. lowest) quintile were 0.71 (0.54, 0.93) for total flavonoids, 0.74 (0.57, 0.95) for flavanones, 0.74 (0.56, 0.96) for flavan-3-ols, 0.90 (0.68, 1.18) for flavonols, 0.73 (0.56, 0.93) for flavones, 0.79 (0.61, 1.02) for isoflavones and 0.74 (0.57, 0.96) for anthocyanins. Sub-group analysis found that the beneficial associations were evident only in overweight/obese participants (P-interactions=0.015). An L-shaped (non-linear) relationship was observed between total flavonoid intake and the risk of NAFLD progression. Path analyses showed that the association between flavonoids and NAFLD progression was mediated by decreases in serum cholesterol and HOMA-IR.

Clustering of ANCA-associated vasculitis: single-centre observation of a spatiotemporal pattern'.,2021-03-31,"BACKGROUND Although breast cancer follow-up guidelines emphasize the importance of clinical examinations, prior studies suggest a small fraction of local-regional events occurring after breast conservation are detected by examination alone. Our objective was to examine how local-regional events are detected in a contemporary, national cohort of high-risk breast cancer survivors. METHODS A stage-stratified sample of stage II/III breast cancer patients diagnosed in 2006-2007 (n = 11,099) were identified from 1217 facilities within the National Cancer Data Base. Additional data on local-regional and distant breast events, method of event detection, imaging received, and mortality were collected. We further limited the cohort to patients with breast conservation (n = 4854). Summary statistics describe local-regional event rates and detection method. RESULTS Local-regional events were detected in 5.5 % (n = 265) of patients. Eighty-three percent were ipsilateral or contralateral in-breast events, and 17 % occurred within ipsilateral lymph nodes. Forty-eight percent of local-regional events were detected on asymptomatic breast imaging, 29 % by patients, and 10 % on clinical examination. Overall, 0.5 % of the 4854 patients had a local-regional event detected on examination. Examinations detected a higher proportion of lymph node events (8/45) compared with in-breast events (18/220). No factors were associated with method of event detection. DISCUSSION Clinical examinations, as an adjunct to screening mammography, have a modest effect on local-regional event detection. This contradicts current belief that examinations are a critical adjunct to mammographic screening. These findings can help to streamline follow-up care, potentially improving follow-up efficiency and quality.","Neuman, Heather B; Schumacher, Jessica R; Francescatti, Amanda B; Adesoye, Taiwo; Edge, Stephen B; Burnside, Elizabeth S; Vanness, David J; Yu, Menggang; Si, Yajuan; McKellar, Dan; Winchester, David P; Greenberg, Caprice C",Annals of surgical oncology,https://doi.org/10.1245/s10434-016-5483-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27491784/,416

135400,Patients with lupus are not protected from COVID-19.,2020-04-24,"The coronavirus disease (COVID-19), identified in Wuhan, China, on December 2019, was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization, on March, 2020. Since then, efforts have been gathered to describe its clinical course and to determine preventive measures and treatment strategies. Adults older than 65 years of age are more susceptible to serious clinical symptoms and present higher mortality rates. Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is a major receptor for some coronavirus infection, including SARS-COV-2, but is also a crucial determinant in anti-inflammation processes during the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) functioning - converting angiotensin II to angiotensin 1-7. The decline in ACE2 expression that occurs with aging has been associated to the higher morbidity and mortality rates in older adults. These observations highlight the importance of investigating the association between COVID-19 and age-related neurodegenerative disorders, i.e., Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases. A possible option to reduce the risk of COVID-19 is vitamin D supplementation, due to its anti-inflammatory and immune-system-modulating effects. It has also been suggested that vitamin D supplementation plays a role in slowing progression of Parkinson and Alzheimer. The present study is a literature review of articles published on the theme COVID-19, Parkinson and Alzheimer's diseases, and the role played by vitamin D.

135508,Coronavirus disease-2019: implications for the gastroenterologist.,2020-10-16,"Neuropsychiatric manifestations of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have been increasingly recognized. However, the pathophysiology of COVID-19 in the central nervous system remains unclear. Brain organoid models derived from human pluripotent stem cells are potentially useful for the study of complex physiological and pathological processes associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) as they recapitulate cellular heterogeneity and function of individual tissues. We identified brain organoid studies that provided insight into the neurotropic properties of SARS-CoV-2. While SARS-CoV-2 was able to infect neurons, the extent of neurotropism was relatively limited. Conversely, choroidal epithelial cells consistently showed a high susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Brain organoid studies also elucidated potential mechanism for cellular entry, demonstrated viral replication, and highlighted downstream cellular effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Collectively, they suggest that the neuropsychiatric manifestations of COVID-19 may be contributed by both direct neuronal invasion and indirect consequences of neuroinflammation. The use of high throughput evaluation, patient-derived organoids, and advent of ""assembloids"" will provide a better understanding and functional characterization of the neuropsychiatric symptoms seen in post-acute COVID-19 syndrome. With advancement of organoid technology, brain organoids offer a promising tool for unravelling pathophysiologic clues and potential therapeutic options for neuropsychiatric complications of COVID-19.","Ng, Jing-Han; Sun, Alfred; Je, Hyunsoo Shawn; Tan, Eng-King","The Neuroscientist : a review journal bringing neurobiology, neurology and psychiatry",https://doi.org/10.1177/10738584211015136; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34036855/,416
136385,COVID-19 Precipitating Euglycaemic Diabetic Ketoacidosis with SGLT2 Inhibitor Use.,2020,"BACKGROUND Midwives' roles in sexual and reproductive health and rights continues to evolve. Understanding the profession's role and how midwives can be integrated into health systems is essential in creating evidence-informed policies. Our objective was to develop a theoretical framework of how political system factors and health systems arrangements influence the roles of midwives within the health system. METHODS A critical interpretive synthesis was used to develop the theoretical framework. A range of electronic bibliographic databases (CINAHL, EMBASE, Global Health database, HealthSTAR, Health Systems Evidence, MEDLINE and Web of Science) was searched through to 14 May 2020 as were policy and health systems-related and midwifery organisation websites. A coding structure was created to guide the data extraction. RESULTS A total of 4533 unique documents were retrieved through electronic searches, of which 4132 were excluded using explicit criteria, leaving 401 potentially relevant records, in addition to the 29 records that were purposively sampled through grey literature. A total of 100 documents were included in the critical interpretive synthesis. The resulting theoretical framework identified the range of political and health system components that can work together to facilitate the integration of midwifery into health systems or act as barriers that restrict the roles of the profession. CONCLUSIONS Any changes to the roles of midwives in health systems need to take into account the political system where decisions about their integration will be made as well as the nature of the health system in which they are being integrated. The theoretical framework, which can be thought of as a heuristic, identifies the core contextual factors that governments can use to best leverage their position when working to improve sexual and reproductive health and rights.","Mattison, Cristina A; Lavis, John N; Wilson, Michael G; Hutton, Eileen K; Dion, Michelle L",Health research policy and systems,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12961-020-00590-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32641053/,416

An ""Environmental Protection Interview (EPI)"" is one of the campaign-style environmental governance methods that target local officials. In this paper, the causal relationship between the implementation of EPI and pollutant emission reduction was confirmed using the method of Time-Varying Difference-in-difference (Time-Varying DID) to compensate for endogeneity problem and ensure that the results are still valid after several robustness checks. Our regional heterogeneous analysis shows that the policy effects of EPI decrease from east to west in China and that they have different emission reduction effects on various types of pollutants. Unfortunately, the results also suggest that policy implementation only temporarily affects pollutant emission reduction, which could be attributed to the governance approaches of campaign-style enforcement according to the impact mechanism analysis. This paper implies that the EPI should be continued to be implemented in the future with some improvements on pollutant reduction mechanisms to ensure effective adoption.","Zhao, Yihang; Zhang, Xinlong; Wang, Yu",Environmental science and pollution research international,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11356-020-09243-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32418091/,416

Although dysmenorrhea has been reported to affect the ability of women to carry out daily activities, the impact of primary dysmenorrheic pain specifically on quality of life (QoL), has yet to be elucidated. We investigated whether QoL varies between women with and without severe primary dysmenorrhea, and whether QoL is impaired only during menstruation or also during pain-free phases of the menstrual cycle. Twelve women with severe primary dysmenorrhea and nine control women completed the quality of life enjoyment and satisfaction questionnaire (Q-LES-Q-SF) during menstruation and during the late follicular phase. Women with dysmenorrhea had a significant reduction in Q-LES-Q-SF scores (mean ± SD: 54 ± 18%, percentage of the total maximum possible score) when they were experiencing severe menstrual pain compared with their own pain-free follicular phase (80 ± 14%, p < 0.0001) and compared with controls during menstruation (81 ± 10%, p < 0.0001). They also rated their overall life satisfaction and contentment as poorer during menstruation.

Tension-free repair is proven to be superior to suture repair in abdominal wall reconstruction. Scaffolds are essential for tension-free repair. They are used to bridge a defect or reinforce the abdominal wall. A huge variety of scaffolds are now commercially available. Most of the synthetic scaffolds are composed of polypropylene. They provide strong tissue reinforcement, but cause a foreign body reaction, which can result in serious complications. Absorbable synthetic scaffolds, such as Dexon™ (polyglycolic acid) and Vicryl™ (polyglactin 910), are not suitable for abdominal wall reconstruction as they usually require subsequent surgeries to repair recurrent hernias. Composite scaffolds combine the strength of nonabsorbable synthetic scaffolds with the antiadhesive properties of the absorbable scaffold, but require long-term follow-up. Biological scaffolds, such as Permacol™, Surgisis(®) and Alloderm(®), are derived from acellular mammalian tissues. Non-cross-linked biological scaffolds show excellent biocompatibility and degrade slowly over time. However, remnant DNA has been found in several products and the degradation leads to recurrence. Randomized controlled trials with long-term follow-up studies are lacking for all of the available scaffolds, particularly those derived from animal tissue. This article provides an overview of the different types of scaffolds available, and presents the key clinical studies of the commercially available synthetic, composite and biological scaffolds for abdominal wall reconstruction.","Meintjes, Jennifer; Yan, Sheng; Zhou, Lin; Zheng, Shusen; Zheng, Minghao",Expert review of medical devices,https://doi.org/10.1586/erd.10.64; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21381916/,416

140735,Management of kidney transplant recipients with coronavirus disease 2019.,2020,"BACKGROUND Recent emergence of COVID-19 caused by a new human coronavirus (CoV) strain (SARS-CoV2), which originated from the China, poses future emergence of additional CoVs. In most of the cases of emergence of human CoVs bats, palm civets, raccoon dogs and camels have been identified as the sources of human infections and reservoir hosts. A review of comparative genomic and phenotypic characteristics of human CoV strains vis-à-vis their comparison with the corresponding animal isolates shall provide the clues regarding the potential genomic, phenotypic and molecular factors responsible for host-switching, which may lead to prospective emergence and reemergence of human CoV outbreaks in future. METHODS The seven known human strains of CoV were analyzed for the host and viral factors responsible for human outbreaks. The molecular factors responsible for host-susceptibility, virulence and pathogenesis were reviewed to predict emergence and re-emergence of additional human CoV strains. CoV spike protein was evaluated as a potential viral receptor for host switching and the target for pharmaceutical design. RESULTS Review of the factors associated with host-susceptibility, virulence and pathogenesis of seven known human CoV strains present significant possibilities for emergence of new CoV strain(s), leading to more human outbreaks. Continuous exposure of animals' handlers to the infected animals, environmental changes, improper sanitations, nondisposal of the solid waste and resumption of exotic animals markets provide favorable conditions for ""host switching"" and emergence of new and potentially more virulent human CoV strains. Mutations in target genes (like spike protein), which facilitate the viral entry into the host-cells, provide potential ""molecular switch"" for preferences of new hostreceptors, genetic diversity, genetic-recombination and high virulence. Additionally, the clinical and environmental factors, asymptomatic carriers, paucity of efficacious vaccines & therapeutics, inefficient disease management and infection control measures, lack of public awareness, and effective communication of information about more virulent human-adapted virus isolates are critical factors for emergence of new and virulent SARS-CoV strains with high mortality and varied incubation period in the near future. Small molecules binding with conserved druggable regions of the CoV spike proteins may be effective against multiple strains of CoVs. CONCLUSIONS High propensity of mutations and ""molecular adaptations"" in coronaviruses create the hot spots and high potential for ""host switching"" leading to emergence of more virulent strains human CoVs. The public/global health agencies, medical communities and research scientists should be prepared for emergence and reemergence of new human CoV strain(s) leading to potential disease outbreaks. The inhibitors binding with conserved druggable regions of spike proteins from multiple strains CoV may have utility as broad-spectrum antiviral drugs to combat future emergence of CoVs.","Ahmad, Fahim; Kamal, Mohammad A; Tekwani, Babu L",Current pharmaceutical design,https://doi.org/10.2174/1381612826666201216113146; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33327904/,416

Maintaining adequate staffing levels is critical to ensuring high-quality nursing home care and an effective response to the pandemic. We therefore sought to examine nursing home staffing levels during the first nine months of 2020 (compared with the same period in 2019), using auditable daily payroll-based staffing data from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. We found that the total number of hours of direct care nursing declined in nursing homes during the COVID-19 pandemic, as did the average nursing home census. When we accounted for changes in census, the number of nurse staff hours per resident day remained steady or, if anything, increased slightly during the pandemic. The observed increases in staff hours per resident day were small but concentrated in nursing homes operating in counties with high COVID-19 prevalence, in nursing homes with low Medicaid census (which typically have more financial resources), and in not-for-profit nursing homes (which typically invest more in staffing). These findings raise concerns that although the number of staff hours in nursing homes did not decline, the perception of shortages has been driven by increased stresses and demands on staff time due to the pandemic, which are harder to quantify.","Werner, Rachel M; Coe, Norma B",Health affairs,https://doi.org/10.1377/hlthaff.2020.02351; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33939511/,416

METHODS This retrospective, multicenter study compares EVT and best medical treatment for computed tomography (CT)-based selection of patients with extensive baseline infarcts (Alberta Stroke Program Early CT Score ≤5) attributed to anterior circulation stroke. Patients were selected from the German Stroke Registry and 3 tertiary stroke centers. Primary functional end points were rates of good (modified Rankin Scale score of ≤3) and very poor outcome (modified Rankin Scale score of ≥5) at 90 days. Secondary safety end point was the occurrence of symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage. Angiographic outcome was evaluated with the modified Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction Scale. RESULTS After 1:1 pair matching, a total of 248 patients were compared by treatment arm. Good functional outcome was observed in 27.4% in the EVT group, and in 25% in the best medical treatment group (P=0.665). Advanced age (adjusted odds ratio, 1.08 [95% CI, 1.05-1.10], P<0.001) and symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage (adjusted odds ratio, 6.35 [95% CI, 2.08-19.35], P<0.001) were independently associated with very poor outcome. Mortality (43.5% versus 28.9%, P=0.025) and symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage (16.1% versus 5.6%, P=0.008) were significantly higher in the EVT group. The lowest rates of good functional outcome (≈15%) were observed in groups of failed and partial recanalization (modified Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction Scale score of 0/1-2a), whereas patients with complete recanalization (modified Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction Scale score of 3) with recanalization attempts ≤2 benefitted the most (modified Rankin Scale score of ≤3:42.3%, P=0.074) compared with best medical treatment. CONCLUSIONS In daily clinical practice, EVT for CT-based selected patients with low Alberta Stroke Program Early CT Score anterior circulation stroke may not be beneficial and is associated with increased risk for hemorrhage and mortality, especially in the elderly. However, first- or second-pass complete recanalization seems to reveal a clinical benefit of EVT highlighting the vulnerability of the low Alberta Stroke Program Early CT Score subgroup.

Early sports specialization and extremely high activity levels have been linked to elevated risk of injury. PURPOSE To investigate for any relationships among quality of physical movement, quantity of physical activity, and degree of sports specialization in a healthy cohort of active children and adolescents. STUDY DESIGN Cross-sectional study with prospectively collected data. METHODS Healthy children between the ages of 10 and 18 years were recruited and completed the Hospital for Special Surgery Pediatric Functional Activity Brief Scale to assess quantity of physical activity and the Jayanthi scale to assess degree of sports specialization (high, score of 2 or 3; low, score of 0 or 1). Movement quality was assessed using motion analysis sensors during 5 repetitions of 4 different jumping and squatting motions, with a maximum score of 100 per participant. Independent-samples t tests were used to compare participants with high versus low specialization on physical activity and movement quality. A Spearman correlation was used to determine the relationship between quantity of physical activity and movement quality, and linear regression was used to assess for the effect of participant age on relevant covariables. RESULTS Final analyses included 147 participants (72% male) with a mean ± SD age of 13.4 ± 2.2 years. Participants who were highly specialized displayed better movement quality than did participants with low sports specialization (27.6 ± 14.0 vs 19.8 ± 10.1; P < .01). Participants who were highly specialized had significantly higher activity levels (24.6 ± 5.9 vs 18.1 ± 6.9; P < .001). Movement quality was moderately correlated with physical activity level (r = 0.335; P < .001). Physical activity; hours of organized sports activity; hours of free, unorganized physical activity; and specialization level were not significant predictors of movement quality when controlling for age. Age alone predicted 24.2% of the variance in the overall movement quality score (R2 = 0.242; B = 3.0; P < .001). CONCLUSION This study found that sports specialization and physical activity levels were not associated with movement quality when controlling for age, which was the most important variable predicting athletic movement quality. Although all participants displayed movement patterns that were associated with high risk for injury, overall movement quality improved with advancing chronological age.

155304,Onset of rheumatoid arthritis after COVID-19: coincidence or connected?,2021-03-01,"Reproductive hormones are implicated in moderating pain. Animal studies support both pronociceptive and antinociceptive actions of oestradiol and progesterone suggesting that the net effect of these hormones on pain is complex and likely depends on the interaction between hormones and the extent of fluctuation rather than absolute hormone levels. Several clinical pain conditions show variation in symptom severity across the menstrual cycle. Though, there is still no consensus on whether the menstrual cycle influences experimental pain sensitivity in healthy individuals. Comprehensive literature searches on clinical and experimental pain across the menstrual cycle, as well as gonadal hormones and pain were performed using the electronic databases PubMed, Google Scholar and the Cochrane Library. Full-text manuscripts were reviewed for relevancy and reference lists were cross-checked for additional relevant studies. Most of the more recent, well-controlled studies show that menstrual cycle phase has no effect on the perception of pain in healthy, pain-free women. Although recent studies investigating pain-related brain activation have shown differential activation patterns across the menstrual cycle in regions involved with cognitive and motor function, even in the absence of a behavioural pain response, suggesting that cognitive pain and bodily awareness systems are sensitive to menstrual cycle phase. The interaction between the gonadal hormones and pain perception is intricate and not entirely understood. We suggest further investigations on the association between female reproductive hormones and pain sensitivity by exploring the interaction between clinical and experimental pain and the hormone changes that characterize puberty, post-partum and the menopause transition.","Iacovides, S; Avidon, I; Baker, F C",European journal of pain,https://doi.org/10.1002/ejp.714; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25899177/,416

157713,Coronavirus Disease-2019 in Children with Nephrotic Syndrome.,2021,"INTRODUCTION The COVID-19 outbreak first occurred in China and has developed throughout the world, including Indonesia. The Indonesian government reports that up to May 22, 2020 there have been 21,430 confirmed cases. The purpose of this study is to describe the epidemiology, clinical symptoms and comorbidities of COVID-19 as well as the various government interventions to reduce the rate of incidence. METHODOLOGY A retrospective cohort study was designed. The population in this study is based data from the official Indonesian government website run by the Task Force for the Acceleration of Handling COVID-19. The sample was observed b March 2 to April 24, 2020. The total sample included 8,211 cases of patients diagnosed with COVID-19, among these 1,002 recovered and 689 died. Data analysis used percentages from various recorded epidemiological variables. RESULTS The results showed that COVID-19 epidemiological features were mostly observed in men (56.5%) and patients of productive age (31-59 of age) by 57.5%; most deaths were recorded in patients aged > 60 years (43.6%). The most recurrent clinical symptom was cough (77.8%), the most recurrent comorbidity was hypertension (52.4%), and the province with the highest COVID-19 incidence was DKI Jakarta (34.3%). CONCLUSIONS The combination of common sources and propagated source was observed during the COVID-19 outbreak in Indonesia. Special attention should be given to protecting vulnerable populations such as children, health care providers, and the elderly. The community is expected to participate in preventing the transmission of COVID-19 by complying with health protocols.","Hikmawati, Isna; Setiyabudi, Ragil",Journal of infection in developing countries,https://doi.org/10.3855/jidc.14240; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34106887/,416

Management strategies for pancreatic injuries include conservative, endoscopic, percutaneous and surgical intervention. Literature on the laparoscopic approach to management of pancreatic trauma is rare and poorly reviewed. We describe a case report of successful and uncomplicated laparoscopic distal pancreatosplenectomy (LDP) for a patient suffering from isolated traumatic pancreatic tail transection. A literature review was performed with regards to the indications for intervention and different modalities of treatment for traumatic pancreatic lacerations. A review and comparison was also made between the scarce pre-existing reports of the laparoscopic approach to pancreatic resection in the setting of trauma. The laparoscopic approach to pancreatic resection, in the setting of trauma, can be considered as a viable alternative to open surgery. Moving forward, further studies with larger patient numbers will be needed to compare the outcomes between the open and laparoscopic approach.","Chin, Ken Min; Koh, Ye-Xin; Goh, Brian K P",Annals of hepato-biliary-pancreatic surgery,https://doi.org/10.14701/ahbps.2019.23.4.408; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31825010/,416

The cat was imported from Spain 4 years earlier and was initially presented with chronic uveitis. Laboratory test results were negative for feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV), feline infectious peritonitis (FIP), feline leukaemia virus (FeLV) and Toxoplasma gondii, as well as for Bartonella haenselae and Leishmania spp. Twenty-one months later the cat was presented again because of development of keratitis and granulomatous blepharitis. Blood cell count revealed severe Pancytopenia; Cytology of fine needle aspirates of granulomatous lesions on both upper eyelids and of a corneal smear revealed intracytoplasmatic microorganisms. A preliminary diagnosis of leishmaniasis was supported by positive polymerase chain reaction from bone marrow and eyelid samples for Leishmania infantum DNA and by a high serum antibody titer for Leishmania spp. Treatment with Allopurinol (10 mg/kg, BID) orally led to rapid improvement of ocular signs, general condition and blood cell count with complete remission of lid and corneal lesions within 2 months of treatment.","Richter,; Schaarschmidt-Kiener,; Krudewig,",Schweizer Archiv fur Tierheilkunde,https://doi.org/10.1024/0036-7281/a000593; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24867242/,416

161666,Antirheumatic agents in covid-19: is IL-6 the right target?,2020-04-16,"BACKGROUND This retrospective study evaluated long-term weight loss, resolution of comorbidities, quality of life (QoL), and food tolerance after laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG). METHODS Between January 2003 and July 2008, 102 patients underwent LSG as a sole bariatric operation. A retrospective review of a prospectively collected database was performed. Demographics, complications, and percentage of excess weight loss (%EWL) were determined. Quality of life was measured using Medical Outcomes Survey Short Form 36 (SF-36) and Bariatric Analysis and Reporting Outcome System (BAROS) questionnaires, which were sent to all patients. The food tolerance score (FTS) was determined and compared with that of nonobese subjects. RESULTS A total of 83 patients (81.4%) were eligible for follow-up evaluation. Their mean initial body mass index (BMI) was 39.3 kg/m(2). No major complications occurred. At a median follow-up point of 49 months (range, 17-80 months), the mean %EWL was 72.3% ± 29.3%. For the 23 patients who reached the 6-year follow-up point, the mean %EWL was 55.9% ± 25.55%. The mean BAROS score was 6.5 ± 2.1, and a ""good"" to ""excellent"" score was observed for 75 patients (90.4%). In the comparison of patients with a %EWL greater than 50% and those with a %EWL of 50% or less, the SF-36 scores were statistically different only for ""physical functioning"" and ""general health perception."" The mean FTS was 23.8, and 95.2% of the patients described their food tolerance as acceptable to excellent. CONCLUSION Laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy is a safe and effective bariatric procedure, although a tendency for weight regain is noted after 5 years of follow-up evaluation. Resolution of comorbidity is comparable with that reported in the literature. The LSG procedure results in good to excellent health-related QoL. Food tolerance is lower for patients after LSG than for nonobese patients who had no surgery, but 95.2% described food tolerance as acceptable to excellent.","D'Hondt, Mathieu; Vanneste, Sofie; Pottel, Hans; Devriendt, Dirk; Van Rooy, Frank; Vansteenkiste, Franky",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-011-1572-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21359900/,416

It used historical-analytic key informant interview (KII) and direct observation methods to argue that the COVID-19 pandemic/period has exposed weaknesses immanent in human institutions globally. One of such exposed interstitial gaps is the seeming weak media-link in the rural areas. This situation results from lack of electricity non-access to reliable locally generated news by resident community members and the lack of know-how to use mobile phones to generate media contents. Rural dwellers constitute 49.66 percent of the total Nigerian population (national population commission [NPC] 2018) yet media focus in Nigeria is mostly urban-driven.

163491,Is nutritional follow-up in patients living with rheumatoid arthritis better with teleconsultation-experience before and after pandemic,2021,"The unprecedented COVID-19 outbreak at the end of 2019 has produced a worldwide health crisis. Scientific research, especially international research collaboration, is crucial to deal successfully with the epidemic. This article aims to review the response modes, and especially the international collaboration characteristic, of the academic community to similar public health events in the past. Based on relevant studies of four major public health emergencies in the past, the major public health emergencies were regarded as ‘new knowledge’ in the academic field. By using knowledge diffusion indicators, such as the breadth and speed of diffusion, and combined with the development characteristics of the event, this article explores the diffusion characteristics of the four major public health emergencies in the academic exchange system and then identifies the academic community’s response mode to the outbreaks. In addition, the characteristics of international collaboration in response to the public health events and the impact of international collaboration on the academic community’s response are analysed. Through the analysis of the international collaboration network, the cooperative groups and core countries in the research collaboration network related to the major public health emergencies are obtained. In terms of COVID-19, it is found that the response speed and intensity of scientists have been significantly improved, but more focus should be given to international collaboration. Our findings could be beneficial to both decision-makers and researchers in policy formulation and conducting research, respectively, to optimally deal with COVID-19 and possible outbreaks in the future.

165091,The effect COVID-19 has on the mental health of people living with rheumatic diseases. From data to interventions,2021,"Background: The coronavirus 2019 disease (COVID-19) is characterised by a heterogeneous clinical presentation and a wide range of imaging findings, depending on disease severity and time course. The pathophysiology is complex, involving immune and hematologic systems, epithelial cells and vascular system and to date reliable biomarkers aimed at stratifying patients and predicting worse outcomes have not been identified Objectives: The aim of this study was to describe clinical, serological and CT imaging features of a cohort of patients with COVID-19 pneumonia and identify possible relationships between the variables and disease outcomes (admission to intensive care unit (ICU) and/or death). Methods: We evaluated hospitalized patients with proven SARS-CoV-2 infection, clinical signs of COVID-19 and computed tomography (CT) scan-proven pulmonary involvement. Clinical and serological records of patients admitted to two COVID-19 Units in Italy with proven SARS-CoV-2 pulmonary involvement investigated with CT scan, assessed at the time of admission to the hospital, were retrospectively collected. Results: Sixty-one patients (22 females and 39 males) of median age 65 years were enrolled. Fifty-six patients were discharged while death occurred in 5 patients. None of the lung abnormalities detected by CT was different between discharged and deceased patients. No differences were observed in the features and extent of pulmonary involvement according to age and gender. Logistic regression analysis with age and gender as covariates demonstrated that ferritin levels over the 25th percentile were associated with the involvement of all 5 pulmonary lobes (OR=14.5, 95% CI=2.3-90.9, p=0.004), the presence of septal thickening (OR=8.2, 95% CI=1.6-40.9, p=0.011) and the presence of mediastinal lymph node enlargement (OR=12.0, 95% CI=1.1-127.5, p=0.039) independently of age and gender. Conclusion: We demonstrated that ferritin levels over the 25th percentile are associated with a more severe pulmonary involvement, independently of age and gender, but not with disease outcomes (admission to ICU/death). The identification of reliable biomarkers in patients with COVID-19 may help guiding clinical decision, tailoring therapeutic approaches and ultimately improving the care and prognosis of patients with this disease.","Carubbi, F.; Alunno, A.; Salvati, L.; Ferri, C.; Grassi, D.",Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases,https://doi.org/10.1136/annrheumdis-2021-eular.61,416

165302,Assessment of emotional well-being in rheumatic patients during COVID-19 lockdown through a web-based survey approach,2021,"In recent decades, the overpopulation on our planet has had an impact on environmental change. Addressing and understanding such changes in a reliable manner requires contemporary data-science knowledge and methodologies since the amount of information available online has been increasing at an exponential rate. Additionally, to draw meaningful conclusions and predict certain events in terms of environmental changes, one must be familiar with existing natural processes. Thus, combining data science with knowledge about global conditions in the world and how they impact Earth's biosphere, would highly benefit the understanding of possible consequences in the environment. Since our planet is a complex, dynamic system that is likely to change, one must be knowledgeable about the global climate system as a whole. As well, one must understand its processes and interactions with the environment to be able to understand and work on preventing the potential inevitable drastic circumstances for living. This paper addresses the issue of environmental changes and presents a solution in the form of academic education, which is currently in progress, and also related to the COVID-19 issues.

165563,The impact and outcome of COVID-19 on systemic sclerosis patients from the european scleroderma trial and research group (EUSTAR),2021,"The novel coronavirus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was identified in Wuhan City, China, in December 2019. Currently, the zoonotic origin of SARS-CoV-2 is unknown. However, one of the hallmarks in severe cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is hypoxemic respiratory failure. Management of severe cases involves procedures such as non-invasive ventilation and endotracheal intubation that have the potential to generate respiratory aerosols. During the current coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, we need to mitigate any risks related to resuscitation as best we can, even if this is disruptive or at some point proven to be overly cautious. Unless we are presented with new evidence, any maneuver performed during cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) should be considered an aerosol generating procedure. Limited data from the SARS epidemic suggests baseline risk of infection among health care workers may be 10%. Performing endotracheal intubation is associated with a 3-5 times higher risk. If causative, this represents an enormous potential for harm (an absolute risk increase of up 40%). Thus, performing endotracheal intubation during CPR should be treated as a very high-risk procedure and managed with the highest precautions, including donning appropriate full enhanced personal protective equipment before entering the scene, to guard against contact with both airborne and droplet particles. The aim of this systematic review snapshot was to identify and summarize in the form of a clinical synopsis the literature surrounding the potential risk of infection transmission associated with key interventions performed in the context of cardiac arrest. © Journal of Emergency and Critical Care Medicine.

It argues that despite implementation of gender-equality policies, the structural sources of gender equality have not been tackled. Most recently this has been reflected in merging gender equality with other initiatives, transforming it from a separate and stand-alone goal. The data is derived from senior managers who were responsible for gender equality during COVID-19 and an analysis of the strategic plans of all public universities. While such senior managers expressed a commitment to change, the university strategic plans revealed either an absence of gender-equality initiatives or their low priority. “Gender” has mostly been subsumed into crowded equity/diversity/inclusion portfolios, making gender inequality invisible. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Bönisch-Brednich, B.; White, K.",Palgrave Studies in Gender and Education,https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-69687-0_5,416

There is limited literature quantifying this interruption of care, particularly in vulnerable and racial/ethnic minorities. Methods: We compared the volume of cancer screening at the University of Illinois Hospital & Health Sciences System before and during the COVID-19 pandemic using data obtained from the electronic medical record. Modalities included mammogram, ultrasound, and MRI for breast;Pap test for cervical;colonoscopy, CT colonography, and flexible sigmoidoscopy for colorectal;low-dose CT for lung;and prostate-specific antigen test for prostate. Of note, screening and diagnostic tests could not be distinguished for colorectal cancer. We examined percent changes in cancer screening counts for each month from February 2020-August 2020, using January 2020 as a reference. Results were stratified by gender, race, and ethnicity. Results: Screening volume declined rapidly after January 2020, with the nadir for each cancer site occurring in April 2020: breast (n = 0, -100%), cervical (n = 169, -84%), colorectal (n = 35, -89%), lung (n = 0, -100%), and prostate (n = 108, -72%). Values recovered by August 2020 for most cancer sites except cervical cancer, which remained decreased (-23%). There were no differences in screening trends by gender. With respect to race, breast screening volume in Black patients decreased earlier and exhibited slower recovery compared to White patients. White patients had poorer cervical screening recovery than Black patients by August 2020 (-60% vs. -23%). Hispanics had poorer recovery of breast screening compared to non-Hispanics by August 2020 (-23% vs. 6%). Conclusions: We observed widely decreased cancer screening attributable to COVID-19. Breast cancer screening data specifically showed persistent disparities affecting Black and Hispanic patients. Despite the reassuring recovery of multiple screening methods by August 2020, an increase above baseline is needed to compensate for initial declines. Further studies will likely reveal long-term consequences of this unprecedented situation.","Khan, M.; Wright, M.; Watson, K.; Jain, S.",Journal of Clinical Oncology,https://doi.org/10.1200/jco.2021.39.15-suppl.10551,416
167593,A citizen science approach to capture poor mental health related to COVID-19 in rheumatic patients after confinement during pandemic in italy,2021,"The relationship between viral infection and obesity has been known for several decades but epidemiological data related to obesity is limited to only a few viral pathogens. To identify associations between viral infections and obesity, a high-throughput virome-wide serological profiling tool, VirScan, was used to measure antibody responses to a wide range of viruses. Serum specimens from 457 Qatari adults (lean=184;obese=273) and 231 Qatari children (lean=111;obese=120) were assessed by VirScan. Pediatric specimens were simultaneously tested by conventional serology for several herpesviruses to validate VirScan results. Viral association with obesity was determined by calculation of odds ratio (OR) and p-values from Fisher test, and by multivariate regression analysis to adjust for age and gender, with Bonferroni correction for multiple testing. Comprehensive serological profiling of Qatari adult population with VirScan revealed positive and negative associations (p<0.05) of antibody responses to members of Herpesviridae and Picornaviridae families, respectively, with obesity. After adjusting p-values for multiple comparisons, only herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) and Rhinovirus A were positively (OR=3.3; 95%CI 2.15-4.99; p=2.787E-08) and negatively (OR=0.4; 95%CI 0.26-0.65; p=1.175E-03) associated with obesity. At the peptide level, higher prevalence of antibodies against several peptide epitopes of HSV-1/2 was positively (OR=2.35-3.82; p≤3.981E-05) associated with obesity. No such associations were seen at the species or peptide levels in the pediatric population. By multivariate regression analysis, HSV-1 was independently associated with obesity irrespective of age and gender. These findings are in agreement with limited data on the adipogenic properties of HSV-1 observed in vitro. Importance The state of Qatar has one of the highest rates of obesity and associated morbidities in the world. Although obesity is predominantly caused by the intake of high calorie diet and reduced physical activities, other factors including infections with certain viruses have been reported. Among these viruses, human adenoviruses were widely studied but epidemiological data for other viruses in relation to human obesity are limited. Here, we studied the association of obesity in Qatari adults and children with a wide range of viral pathogens using VirScan, a virome-wide serological profiling tool. Our results indicate significant association HSV-1 with obesity in the adult population only. Furthermore, we have identified a set of HSV peptides as candidate obesogenic factors for future studies.","Hasan, Mohammad Rubayet; Rahman, Mahbuba; Khan, Taushif; Saeed, Amira; Sundaraju, Sathyavathi; Flores, Annaliza; Hawken, Philip; Rawat, Arun; Elkum, Naser; Hussain, Khalid; Tan, Rusung; Tang, Patrick; Marr, Nico",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.09.02.280503,416

However, there are uncertainties around when, how and for how long schools need to be closed. There is limited evidence for the impact of school closure on the number of cases and spread of COVID-19 to inform management of future outbreaks. Several databases were searched using an adapted search strategy to obtain studies that met the inclusion and exclusion criteria. A large number of studies were found and they were quality appraised. Eight good quality studies were identified and these were reviewed. The studies that contained the desired outcomes were three epidemiological studies, and five modelling studies using actual data that making assumptions about changes in transmission dynamics after school closure is applied. The results show that schools were closed for different timings related to the peak epidemics. School closure almost reduced the transmission of the COVID-19. Delay in closing schools and combinations with other control and management measures may affect the likelihood of drawing consistent conclusions about the effectiveness of school closure on COVID-19.","Muhammed, Z.

Purpose: The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of diabetes management on the severity and length of hospitalization in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Methods: This retrospective study used medical records from patients admitted to the University Medical Center, El Paso, TX with COVID-19 (n=369;Age 60.0 ± 0.8 years;BMI 30.3 ± 0.4 Kg/m2). Glycemia was assessed by glycated hemoglobin (A1c) level at the time of hospitalization. The severity of the COVID-19 outcome was assessed by quick sepsis-related organ failure assessment (qSOFA) and length of hospitalization was determined by the number of days spent in the hospital. Patients were categorized into normoglycemic (N: A1c <5.7%), prediabetes (Pre: 5.7% ≤ A1c < 6.5%), and diabetes mellitus (DM: A1c ≥ 6.5%) groups. DM group was further categorized for diabetes management with medication. One-way ANOVA and unpaired t-test were used to determine the statistical differences among/between groups as appropriate. Results: There was no significant difference among groups in severity of COVID-19 infection (qSOFA: N 0.24 ± 0.08, Pre 0.38 ± 0.07, D 0.28 ± 0.03;p>0.05) and length of hospitalization (N 5.6 ± 0.8, Pre 9.3 ± 1.0, DM 8.9 ± 0.6 days;p>0.05). However, patients with unmanaged diabetes (no medication) showed significantly greater severity (qSOFA: 0.44 ± 0.08 vs. 0.22 ± 0.03;p<0.05) and length of hospitalization (10.8 ± 1.6 vs. 8.2 ± 0.6 days;p<0.05) compared to patients who managed diabetes with medication. Conclusion: Unmanaged diabetes shows worsened severity and the rate of recovery in COVID-19 patients. Diabetes management should be considered in the treatment of COVID-19 patients.","Mossayebi, Ali Kreit Helen Cherukuri Sundar V.; Mandania, Roshni A.; Concha, Jeannie B.; Jung, Hyejin Wagler Amy E.; Gupte, Akshay A.; Deoker, Abhizith Bajpeyi Sudip",Diabetes,https://doi.org/10.2337/db21-845-p,416

Despite being large metropolises, Kinshasa, Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), and Brazzaville, Republic of the Congo (ROC), which possess populations of 14.3 million and 2.4 million, respectively, use no reference air pollution monitors at the time of writing. However, a few reference monitors have recently been deployed in other parts of sub-Saharan Africa, including a Met One Beta Attenuation Monitor (BAM-1020) at the U.S. Embassy in Kampala, Uganda, next to which a low-cost PM2.5 monitor, the PurpleAir, was collocated in August 2019. The raw PurpleAir data from September 2019 through February 2020 strongly correlated with the BAM-1020 measurements (R-2 = 0.88) but also exhibited a mean absolute error (MAE) of approximately 14 mu g m(-3). Employing two calibration models, namely, multiple linear regression and random forests, decreased the MAE to 3.4 mu g m(-3) and increased R-2 to 0.96. Given the similarity in climate and emissions, we applied the collocated field correction factors for Kampala to four PurpleAir units in Kinshasa and one in neighboring Brazzaville, which were deployed in April 2018. We estimated an average annual PM2.5 concentration of 43.5 mu g m(-3) in Kinshasa for 2019, which exceeds the World Health Organization (WHO)'s Interim Target 1 (10 mu g m(-3)) by 4 times. Finally, the surface PM2.5 level and the aerosol optical depth were about 40% lower during the COVID-19 lockdown in 2020 than the corresponding period in 2019, which cannot be attributed solely to changes in meteorology or wildfire emission. Hence, our results highlight the need to implement clean air solutions in the Congo.","McFarlane, C.; Isevulambire, P. K.; Lumbuenamo, R. S.; Ndinga, A. M. E.; Dhammapala, R.; Jin, X. M.; McNeill, V.

Due to environmental issues and quality of life concerns, communities are reclaiming street spaces for active modes and slowing the speeds in their downtown. Moreover, tactical urbanism, i.e., the use of street space for innovative purposes other than moving automobile traffic, is becoming attractive due to reduced automobile travel demand and the need for outdoor activities in the age of the COVID-19 pandemic. This study provides details of the modeling of an urban downtown network (in the City of San Jose) using microscopic traffic simulation. The model is then applied to evaluate the effectiveness of street design changes at varying demand scenarios. The microsimulation approach was chosen because it allows for the detailed modeling and visualization of the transportation networks, including movements of individual vehicles, bicyclists, and pedestrians. The street design change demonstrated here involves one-way to two-way street conversion, but the framework of network-wide impact evaluation may also be used for complete street conversions. The base conditions network was also tested under different travel demand reduction scenarios (10%, 20%, and 30%) to identify the corridors in the city network in which the tactical urbanism strategies (e.g., open-air dining) may be best accommodated. The study provides framework for the use of a microscopic model as part of a decision support system to evaluate and effectively implement complete streets/tactical urbanism strategies.","Liu, B.; Molan, A.

Additionally, we explored gender differences and the perceived usefulness of teaching. 201 students (48 men, 153 women;mean age = 22.900, SD = 2.830) participated in the study. They answered a Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support, a Brief Cope Scale, a Student-life Stress Inventory, a visual analog scale for usefulness, and a survey collecting their perceptions about learning across teaching types. Results point out a preference for classical teaching, followed by the hybrid and online formats. Online teaching was identified as more advantageous in terms of time management and seeking information. Denial and substance use were statistically associated with poor communication, bad time using, and impaired learning. Both stress and social support had ambivalent associations with learning perceptions. Gender differences were limited to behavioral disengagement and higher social support perceived by women. Although classical teaching was globally perceived as the most useful, online teaching was considered desirable by male urban respondents. These data may contribute to the strategic growth and refinement of web-based teaching methods in medical universities.","Popa-Velea, Ovidiu Pristavu Carmen Andreea Ionescu Claudiu Gabriel Mihăilescu Alexandra Ioana Diaconescu Liliana Veronica",Education Sciences,https://doi.org/10.3390/educsci11080414,416
170406,Impact of COVID-19 on initiation and renewal of biotherapies and targeted synthetic treatments,2021,"Severe pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) have been described in patients with severe COVID-19. Recently, early clinical data reported the efficacy of low doses of radiation therapy (RT) in the treatment of ARDS in patients with severe COVID-19. However, the involved mechanisms remained unknown. Here, we used airways-instilled lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and influenza virus (H1N1) as murine models of pneumonia, and Tolllike receptor (TLR)-3 stimulation in human lung macrophages. Low doses RT (0.5-1 Gy) decreased LPS induced pneumonia, and increased the percentage of Nerve- and Airway-associated Macrophages (NAMs) producing IL-10. During H1N1 viral infection, we observed decreased lung tissue damage and immune cell infiltration in irradiated animals. Low doses RT increased IL-10 production by infiltrating immune cells into the lung. Irradiation of TLR-3 ligand-stimulated human lung macrophages ex vivo increased IL-10 secretion and decreased IFNγ production in the culture supernatant. The percentage of human lung macrophages producing IL-6 was also decreased. Our data highlight one of the mechanisms by which low doses RT regulate lung inflammation and skew lung macrophages towards an anti-inflammatory profile. These data provide the preclinical rationale for the use and for the optimization of low doses RT in situations such as COVID-19-induced ARDS.","Meziani, Lydia; Robert, Charlotte; Classe, Marion; Da Costa, Bruno; Mondini, Michele; Clemenson, Céline; Mordant, Pierre; Ammari, Samy; Le Goffic, Ronan; Deutsch, Eric",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.11.077651,416

172433,"Is COVID 19, a beginning of new entity called chronic viral systemic inflammatory syndrome?",2021,"Clinical datasets are intrinsically imbalanced, dominated by overwhelming majority groups. Off-the-shelf machine learning models optimize the prognosis of majority patient types (e.g., healthy class), causing substantial errors on the minority prediction class (e.g., disease class) and minority subpopulations (e.g., Black or young patients). For example, missed death prediction is 36.6 times higher than non-death cases in a mortality benchmark. Racial and age disparities also exist. Conventional metrics such as AUC-ROC do not reflect these deficiencies. We design a double prioritized (DP) sampling technique to improve the accuracy for underrepresented subpopulations. We report our findings on four prediction tasks over two clinical datasets, and comparisons with eight existing sampling solutions. With DP, the recall of minority classes shows 35.4-130.4% improvement. Compared to the state-of-the-arts, DP sampling gives 1.2-58.8 times more balanced recalls and precisions. Our method trains customized models for specific race or age groups, a departure from the one-model-fits-all-demographics paradigm.

However, the transcription factors and gene regulatory networks underlying cellular identity in the human adult pancreas remain largely unexplored. Here, we integrate multiple single-cell RNA sequencing datasets of the human adult pancreas, totaling 7393 cells, and comprehensively reconstruct gene regulatory networks. We show that a network of 142 transcription factors forms distinct regulatory modules that characterize pancreatic cell types. We present evidence that our approach identifies key regulators of cell identity in the human adult pancreas. We predict that HEYL and JUND are active in acinar and alpha cells, respectively, and show that these proteins are present in the human adult pancreas as well as in human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived pancreatic cells. The comprehensive gene regulatory network atlas can be explored interactively online. We anticipate our analysis to be the starting point for a more sophisticated dissection of how transcription factors regulate cell identity in the human adult pancreas. Furthermore, given that transcription factors are major regulators of embryo development and are often perturbed in diseases, a comprehensive understanding of how transcription factors work will be relevant in development and disease biology.

Methods The Critical Care Asia federated registry platform enables ICUs to collect clinical, outcome and process data for aggregate and unit-level analysis. The evaluation used the standardised criteria of the Directory of Clinical Databases (DoCDat) and a framework for data quality assurance in medical registries. Six reviewers assessed structure, coverage, reliability and validity of the ICU registry data. Case mix and process measures on patient episodes from June to December 2020 were analysed. Results Data on 20,507 consecutive patient episodes from 97 ICUs in Afghanistan, Bangladesh, India, Malaysia, Nepal, Pakistan and Vietnam were included. The quality level achieved according to the ten prespecified DoCDat criteria was high (average score 3.4 out of 4) as was the structural and organizational performance -- comparable to ICU registries in high-income countries. Identified strengths were types of variables included, reliability of coding, data completeness and validation. Potential improvements include extension of national coverage.

Total calcium (TCa) measurement can be misleading in cases where the concentration of albumin is abnormal. We aimed to investigate which calcium level —ionized calcium (iCa) or TCa—may be more closely related to the QTc interval in COVID-19 patients in whom hypocalcemia and hypoalbuminemia are observed frequently. Adult patients hospitalized for COVID-19 were included in this study. ICa levels were obtained from the venous blood gas sample examined during the emergency department admission, and the TCa levels were obtained from the biochemistry results on admission. The pH-adjusted iCa (Corrected-iCa) and albumin-adjusted TCa (corrected-TCa) were calculated. The QT interval was measured from the admission ECG and corrected for heart rate using the Bazett formula. Hundred and thirty-two patients were included in the study. The mean age was 50±19 years, and 62 (47%) patients were female. Median iCa level was 1,13 mmol/L (1,08-1,18 interquartile range (IQR)), median TCa level was 2.13 mmol/L (2.02-2.22 IQR). 76 patients (57%) had hypocalcemia (iCa<1,16 mmol/L). The median QTc interva l was 431 ms (414-450 IQR).

We aimed to identify risk factors that may explain the burden of cases and help develop preventive strategies. Methods: We performed a case-control study comparing cases diagnosed with CAM and those who had recovered from COVID-19 without developing mucormycosis (controls). Information on comorbidities, glycemic control, and practices related to COVID-19 prevention and treatment was recorded. Results: 352 patients (152 cases and 200 controls) diagnosed with COVID-19 during April-May 2021 were included. In the CAM group, symptoms of mucormycosis began a mean 18.9 (SD 9.1) days after onset of COVID-19, and predominantly rhino-sinus and orbital involvement was present. All, but one, CAM cases carried conventional risk factors of diabetes and steroid use. On multivariable regression, increased odds of CAM were associated with the presence of diabetes (adjusted OR 3.5, 95%CI 1.1-11), use of systemic steroids (aOR 7.7,95% CI 2.4-24.7), prolonged use of cloth and surgical masks (vs no mask, aOR 6.9, 95%CI 1.5-33.1), and repeated nasopharyngeal swab testing during the COVID-19 illness (aOR 1.6,95% CI 1.2-2.2). Zinc therapy, probably due to its utility in immune function, was found to be protective (aOR 0.05, 95%CI 0.01-0.19). Notably, the requirement of oxygen supplementation or hospitalization did not affect the risk of CAM. Conclusion: Judicious use of steroids and stringent glycemic control are vital to preventing mucormycosis. Use of clean masks, preference for N95 masks if available, and minimizing swab testing after the diagnosis of COVID-19 may further reduce the incidence of CAM.","Arora, U.; Priyadarshi, M.; Katiyar, V.; Soneja, M.; Garg, P.; Gupta, I.; Bharadiya, V.; Berry, P.; Ghosh, T.; Patel, L.; Sarda, R.; Garg, S.; Agarwal, S.; Arora, V.; Ramprasad, A.; Kumar, A.; Garg, R.

In this study, ileum and bursa of Fabricius tissues of mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) infected with low-pathogenic avian influenza (LPAIV) were evaluated at various post-infection time points to determine genetic host factors associated with intraspecific variation in viral shedding. By analyzing transcriptome sequencing data (RNA-seq), we found that LPAIV-infected mallards do not exhibit differential gene expression compared to uninfected birds, but that gene expression was associated with viral shedding quantity early in the infection. In both tissues, immune genes were mostly up-regulated in higher shedding birds and had significant positive relationships with viral shedding. In the ileum, host genes involved in viral cell entry were down-regulated in low shedders one day post-infection (DPI), and host genes promoting viral replication were up-regulated in high shedders on two DPI. Our findings indicate that viral shedding is a key factor for gene expression differences in LPAIV-infected mallards, and the genes identified in this study could be important for understanding the molecular mechanisms driving intraspecific variation in pathogen shedding.","Dolinski, Amanda C.; Homola, Jared J.; Jankowski, Mark D.; Robinson, John D.; Owen, Jennifer C.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.08.23.457327,416
176946,The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on physical functioning and mental wellbeing in 824 patients with rheumatic disease over 8 months: Physical functioning declines,2021,"Purpose: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic has caused stress for everyone and impacted the lives of people globally. Such stress increases troubles for the employees. Therefore, the aim of the paper is to identify symptoms of health problems that employees face during the COVID-19 epidemic. Also, the aim of the paper is to examine if there are statistically significant differences in the physical, emotional and behavioral symptoms of health problems among employees before the COVID-19 epidemic and employees during the COVID-19 epidemic. Design/methodology/approach: The research is based on a survey of 950 employees in Slovenian companies. The factor analysis and the t-test for two independent samples were used to test the hypotheses of the research. Findings: The results show that physical, emotional and behavioral symptoms of health problems of employees during the COVID-19 epidemic are intensified as compared to the before COVID-19 epidemic era. Originality/value: The results highlight the measures with which companies can reduce the problem of different symptoms of employees during the COVID-19 epidemic. The results can be useful for employers and for managers who want to create an adequate working environment for employees during the COVID-19 epidemic. © 2021, Maja Rožman and Polona Tominc.","Rožman, M.; Tominc, P.",Employee Relations,https://doi.org/10.1108/er-10-2020-0469,416

News outlets began reporting what I had already concluded based on my own social media: in response, many people had started baking bread. Baking specialty bread, like sourdough, is a time-consuming process, which pre-COVID-19 was a leisure activity for some. Baking bread during isolation is an activity whose purposes are threefold: providing sustenance; filling newly available leisure time; and offering a way to demonstrate one’s skill and activities on social media. I consider the sudden attention given to this niche area of cooking, and the ways that bread-making-as-identity is already being disputed online, with attempts to frame an increased interest in what is, ultimately, successful completion of domestic labor, as a threat to ‘authentic’ interest in specialty bread as culinary capital.","Easterbrook-Smith, Gwyn",Leis.

Different methods have been established since the beginning to identify infected patients and restrict the spread of the virus. In addition to laboratory analysis, used as the gold standard, several applications have been developed to apply deep learning algorithms to chest X-ray (CXR) images to diagnose patients affected by COVID-19. The literature shows that convolutional neural networks (CNNs) perform well on a single image dataset, but fail to generalize to other sources of data. To overcome this limitation, we present a late fusion approach in which multiple CNNs collaborate to diagnose the CXR scan of a patient, improving the generalizability. Experiments on three datasets publicly available show that the ensemble of CNNs outperforms stand-alone networks, achieving promising performance not only in cross-validation, but also when external validation is used, with an average accuracy of 95.18%. © 2021 IEEE.","Guarrasi, V.; D039,; Amico, N.

182131,COVID 19 crisis: Rapid development of remote rheumatology medication clinics,2021,"Aim/Objectives: To ascertain the effect of migrant workers on the spread of COVID-19 in Odisha, India and to examine both local and global stability. Study Design: Out-migrants are diagnosed at compartment (A), those who were confirmed positive, they were sent to the infected compartment (I) for treatment and the remaining healthy individuals are sent to quarantine compartment (Q) for a period of twenty one days under surveillance or observation. Then basing on the principle of mathematical epidemiology, the set of ordinary (nonlinear) differential equations is formulated. Methodology/Approach: Jacobian Matrices are employed to find eigen values of the system for stability behaviour. Routh-Hurwitz Criterion and Poincare-Bendixson theorem are used for stability analysis. The set of ordinary (nonlinear) differential equations are solved using Runge-Kutta fourth order method. The simulation of numerical data is performed using MATLAB. Results: The study shows that the prevalence of COVID-19 would remain nearly 250 to 300 days in Odisha since the inception of entry of infected migrants to the state till the disease is stable. Further the study proves that it persists to endemic equilibrium for global stability when basic reproduction number greater than unity. The numerical and analytical results of the study establish that the disease free equilibrium is locally stable when basic reproduction number is less than unity and unstable when it is more than unity. Conclusions: As there is no specific treatment, vaccine or medicine available for the disease till the date, so the only intervention procedure called quarantine process is devised in this model to check the stability behaviour of the disease. Due to intervention of quarantine, lock-down, shutdown and other social distancing rules, the study shows that the system is stable after a certain period of time. This mathematical modelling embedded with important risk factor like migration could be adopted for each state that will be helpful for better prediction of the entire country and world. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Rauta, A.

While the GL protein associated with M rapidly and efficiently, newly synthesized M protein was incorporated into complexes at a slower rate, which implies that it interacts with GL molecules synthesized earlier. Analysis under nonreducing conditions revealed that the GL/M complexes consist of disulfide-linked heterodimeric structures. Pulse-chase experiments showed that virtually all GL monomers ended up in heterodimers, whereas a fraction of the M protein persisted as monomers. The M protein also formed covalently linked homodimers, but only the heterodimers were incorporated into virus particles.","de Vries, A A; Post, S M; Raamsman, M J; Horzinek, M C; Rottier, P J",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7609031/,416

199819,Antibody Responses and Clinical Outcomes in Adults Hospitalized with Severe COVID-19: A Post hoc Analysis of LOTUS China Trial,2020,"In the life cycle of plus-strand RNA viruses, the genome initially serves as the template for both translation of the viral replicase gene and synthesis of minus-strand RNA and is ultimately packaged into progeny virions. These various processes must be properly balanced to ensure efficient viral proliferation. To achieve this, higher-order RNA structures near the termini of a variety of RNA virus genomes are thought to play a key role in regulating the specificity and efficiency of viral RNA synthesis. In this study, we have analyzed the signals for minus-strand RNA synthesis in the prototype of the arterivirus family, equine arteritis virus (EAV). Using site-directed mutagenesis and an EAV reverse genetics system, we have demonstrated that a stem-loop structure near the 3' terminus of the EAV genome is required for RNA synthesis. We have also obtained evidence for an essential pseudoknot interaction between the loop region of this stem-loop structure and an upstream hairpin residing in the gene encoding the nucleocapsid protein. We propose that the formation of this pseudoknot interaction may constitute a molecular switch that could regulate the specificity or timing of viral RNA synthesis. This hypothesis is supported by the fact that phylogenetic analysis predicted the formation of similar pseudoknot interactions near the 3' end of all known arterivirus genomes, suggesting that this interaction has been conserved in evolution.","Beerens, Nancy; Snijder, Eric J",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17581985/,416
201796,Repeated negative serological testing in otherwise healthy patients with COVID-19,2020,"Bovine Coronavirus (BCoV) is widespread both in dairy and beef cattle throughout the world. The virus is one of the largest RNA virus and has specific tropism for intestinal and pulmonary epithelial cells. It is responsible for huge economic losses by causing winter dysentery in adult dairy cattle and respiratory and intestinal tract infections leading to pneumo-enteritis in young calves. Isolation of BCoV has been reported to be difficult. Studies regarding epidemiology, virus isolation and molecular detection from India are very few. In the present study Vero cell line was used for isolation of the BCoV from Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) positive samples. Direct florescent antibody technique (dFAT) and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) were used to confirm the isolated virus strains at antigenic and genomic levels, respectively. Out of the 15 positive fecal samples, virus from only seven was able to infect vero cell line. Subsequently BCoV got adapted to the vero cell line upto three passages, which was confirmed both at genomic and antigenic levels by dFAT and RT-PCR testing. It can be concluded that vero cell line can be used for isolation of BCoV, however due to the enormous stain diversity of the virus it is possible that many stains can't grow and get adapt in this cell line. Further studies are required for isolation of different viral strains, finding the susceptible cell lines and also to confirm the variations among the BCoV isolates at antigenic/genomic levels.","Hansa, A; Rai, R B; Dhama, K; Wani, M Y; Saminathan, M; Ranganath, G J",Pakistan journal of biological sciences : PJBS,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24511744/,416

CNWL is a large NHS provider and has approximately 7000 staff working across 150 locations, providing mental health and community health services. In response to the need to share learning across the organisation, a trustwide “Safety Conversation Day” took place to spotlight the work being done to promote safety and to act as a platform to share ideas and learning across the trust. This was the first ever virtual conference organised by the trust.MethodThe one-day conference included virtual posters and an all-day open access virtual conversation delivered via zoom. The day was divided into 6 safety themes: Safety tools;Safer Environments;Supporting and Involving Staff;Safer use of Medicines;See Think Act and Relational Security;and Prevention is Better than Cure. Frontline staff delivered 5-6 short presentations each hour highlighting new ways of working, quality improvement, local research etc.Staff were also encouraged to submit posters for the event, with webinars held on how to write a poster held prior to the safety conversation to promote engagement. Prizes were awarded for best posters in the different categories.A mentimeter survey was running throughout the day to get feedback from participants.ResultThis was the largest event of this kind held by the trust. 430 unique viewers logged in during the day to watch the presentations.Feedback was very positive on the mentimeter survey. 3 questions were asked on a likert scale of: Strongly Disagree – Strongly Agree (rated out of 5):– ‘I found the posters really useful': 4.5/5– ‘I found the presentations very useful': 4.6/5– ‘I will share what I've learnt about safety': 4.6/5Open space questions and word cloud responses also highlighted qualitative feedback with most frequent responses including ‘inspiring', ‘interesting and ‘stimulating’.174 posters were presented with good representation from all services and staff groups across the trust (18 on safer use of medicines, 15 on co-production, 52 on quality improvement, 50 on COVID and non-COVID safety, 16 on use of technology, 23 on supporting and involving staff).

202437,Early diagnosis and population prevention of coronavirus disease 2019,2020,"PURPOSE: Reported associations between vitamin 25(OH)D and exercise performance are equivocal, perhaps due to complex interplay with cortisol and testosterone. In this study, the authors investigated serum 25(OH)D and cortisol as moderators of the testosterone relationship with exercise performance in adolescent male athletes. METHODS: A total of 88 ice hockey players were assessed for serum 25(OH)D, cortisol, testosterone, body composition, and exercise performance, based on countermovement jump power and muscle torque. The authors tested independent relationships, before examining complex interactions via moderated regression analyses. RESULTS: Most athletes (62.5%) exhibited a suboptimal (20-30 ng·mL-1) serum 25(OH)D concentration, whereas 9.1% of athletes were deficient (<20 ng·mL-1). Serum 25(OH)D was not related to performance when controlling for testing year, age, and fat mass. Further modeling revealed a significant hormonal interaction. Specifically, in low-25(OH)D subjects, testosterone predicted countermovement jump power at a high (ß = 7.10, effect size = .43, P < .01), but not low (ß = -3.32, effect size = -.20, P = .09), cortisol concentration. CONCLUSIONS: Serum 25(OH)D was a poor predictor of exercise performance, but it did moderate (with cortisol) the testosterone link to muscle power. Notably, this relationship emerged among individuals with a 25(OH)D concentration (â¼22 ng·mL-1) approaching the deficiency cutoff. Viewing 25(OH)D as a moderating, rather than dose responsive, variable could help explain equivocal cross-sectional associations.","Crewther, Blair; Cook, Christian; Fitzgerald, John; Starczewski, Michal; Gorski, Michal; Orysiak, Joanna",Pediatr Exerc Sci,,416

We assessed the cell-type-specific expression of ACE2, TMPRSS2 and CTSL across 107 single-cell RNA-sequencing studies from different tissues. ACE2, TMPRSS2 and CTSL are coexpressed in specific subsets of respiratory epithelial cells in the nasal passages, airways and alveoli, and in cells from other organs associated with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) transmission or pathology. We performed a meta-analysis of 31 lung single-cell RNA-sequencing studies with 1,320,896 cells from 377 nasal, airway and lung parenchyma samples from 228 individuals. This revealed cell-type-specific associations of age, sex and smoking with expression levels of ACE2, TMPRSS2 and CTSL. Expression of entry factors increased with age and in males, including in airway secretory cells and alveolar type 2 cells. Expression programs shared by ACE2+TMPRSS2+ cells in nasal, lung and gut tissues included genes that may mediate viral entry, key immune functions and epithelial-macrophage cross-talk, such as genes involved in the interleukin-6, interleukin-1, tumor necrosis factor and complement pathways. Cell-type-specific expression patterns may contribute to the pathogenesis of COVID-19, and our work highlights putative molecular pathways for therapeutic intervention.","Muus, Christoph; Luecken, Malte D; Eraslan, Gökcen; Sikkema, Lisa; Waghray, Avinash; Heimberg, Graham; Kobayashi, Yoshihiko; Vaishnav, Eeshit Dhaval; Subramanian, Ayshwarya; Smillie, Christopher; Jagadeesh, Karthik A; Duong, Elizabeth Thu; Fiskin, Evgenij; Triglia, Elena Torlai; Ansari, Meshal; Cai, Peiwen; Lin, Brian; Buchanan, Justin; Chen, Sijia; Shu, Jian; Haber, Adam L; Chung, Hattie; Montoro, Daniel T; Adams, Taylor; Aliee, Hananeh; Allon, Samuel J; Andrusivova, Zaneta; Angelidis, Ilias; Ashenberg, Orr; Bassler, Kevin; Bécavin, Christophe; Benhar, Inbal; Bergenstråhle, Joseph; Bergenstråhle, Ludvig; Bolt, Liam; Braun, Emelie; Bui, Linh T; Callori, Steven; Chaffin, Mark; Chichelnitskiy, Evgeny; Chiou, Joshua; Conlon, Thomas M; Cuoco, Michael S; Cuomo, Anna S E; Deprez, Marie; Duclos, Grant; Fine, Denise; Fischer, David S; Ghazanfar, Shila; Gillich, Astrid",Nat Med,,416
206079,A Meta-analysis of the Relationship Between Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System Inhibitors and COVID-19,2020,"BACKGROUND: COVID-19 outbreaks have occurred in homeless shelters across the US, highlighting an urgent need to identify the most effective infection control strategy to prevent future outbreaks. METHODS: We developed a microsimulation model of SARS-CoV-2 transmission in a homeless shelter and calibrated it to data from cross-sectional polymerase chain reaction (PCR) surveys conducted during COVID-19 outbreaks in five homeless shelters in three US cities from March 28 to April 10, 2020. We estimated the probability of averting a COVID-19 outbreak when an exposed individual is introduced into a representative homeless shelter of 250 residents and 50 staff over 30 days under different infection control strategies, including daily symptom-based screening, twice-weekly PCR testing, and universal mask wearing. RESULTS: The proportion of PCR-positive residents and staff at the shelters with observed outbreaks ranged from 2.6 to 51.6%, which translated to the basic reproduction number (R0) estimates of 2.9-6.2. With moderate community incidence (~ 30 confirmed cases/1,000,000 people/day), the estimated probabilities of averting an outbreak in a low-risk (R0 = 1.5), moderate-risk (R0 = 2.9), and high-risk (R0 = 6.2) shelter were respectively 0.35, 0.13, and 0.04 for daily symptom-based screening; 0.53, 0.20, and 0.09 for twice-weekly PCR testing; 0.62, 0.27, and 0.08 for universal masking; and 0.74, 0.42, and 0.19 for these strategies in combination. The probability of averting an outbreak diminished with higher transmissibility (R0) within the simulated shelter and increasing incidence in the local community. CONCLUSIONS: In high-risk homeless shelter environments and locations with high community incidence of COVID-19, even intensive infection control strategies (incorporating daily symptom screening, frequent PCR testing, and universal mask wearing) are unlikely to prevent outbreaks, suggesting a need for non-congregate housing arrangements for people experiencing homelessness. In lower-risk environments, combined interventions should be employed to reduce outbreak risk.","Chapman, Lloyd A C; Kushel, Margot; Cox, Sarah N; Scarborough, Ashley; Cawley, Caroline; Nguyen, Trang Q; Rodriguez-Barraquer, Isabel; Greenhouse, Bryan; Imbert, Elizabeth; Lo, Nathan C",BMC Med,,416

211913,Meta-analysis of cardiac markers for predictive factors on severity and mortality of COVID-19,2021,"Model Driven Engineering (MDE) plays a very important role in improving the development of complex systems. It focuses more on modeling than on classical programming. In this sense, model transformation is at the heart of the Model Driven Architecture (MDA) approach which advocates the use of models throughout the software development cycle on two levels. The first being the transformation of Computing Independent Model (CIM) into Platform Independent Model (PIM) and the second concerning the transformation of PIM into Platform Specific Model (PSM). The latter has been dealt with in the majority of research works while the transformation from CIM to PIM which represents the highest level is rarely discussed in research topics. It is for this reason and in the spirit of improving the process of transforming the CIM model into PIM according to the MDA approach, that we have developed this research work in order to propose a new method and new transformation rules for optimization of the business process ""COVID-19 patient management"". Our contribution consists of the semi-automatic transformation of the CIM model presented by the BPMN (Business Process Model and Notation) source model into a PIM target model presented by a class diagram by using a set of transformation and correspondence rules that we performed manually using the language ATL (Atlas Transformation Language). This automatic transformation of the two source and target models is provided by the Eclipse Modeling Framework (EMF) which executes the transformation rules described manually in ATL and generates the PIM target model as an XMI (XML Metadata Interchange) file representing the target class diagram.","Amr, M.

We felt there was a need for rapid proof-of-concept human self-exposure, to inform future controlled research and promote informed discussion. A Fitzpatrick Skin Type II individual exposed their inner forearms to large radiant exposures from a filtered Krypton-Chloride (KrCl) far-UVC system (SafeZoneUVC, Ushio Inc., Tokyo, Japan) with peak emission at 222 nm. No visible skin changes were observed at 1500 mJ cm-2 ; whereas, skin yellowing that appeared immediately and resolved within 24 h occurred with a 6000 mJ cm-2 exposure. No erythema was observed at any time point with exposures up to 18 000 mJ cm-2 . These results combined with Monte Carlo Radiative Transfer computer modeling suggest that filtering longer ultraviolet wavelengths is critical for the human skin safety of far-UVC devices. This work also contributes to growing arguments for the exploration of exposure limit expansion, which would subsequently enable faster inactivation of viruses.","Eadie, Ewan; Barnard, Isla M R; Ibbotson, Sally H; Wood, Kenneth",Photochem. photobiol,,416

This response is thought to contribute to the pathogenicity of severe COVID-19. There is an initial weak interferon response and macrophage activation that results in delayed neutrophil recruitment leading to impeded viral clearance. This causes prolonged immune stimulation and the release of proinflammatory cytokines. Elevated inflammatory markers in COVID-19 (i.e., D-dimer, C-reactive protein, lactate dehydrogenase, ferritin, and interleukin-6) are reminiscent of ""cytokine storm"" seen in severe hyperinflammatory macrophage disorders. The dysfunctional immune response in COVID-19 also includes lymphopenia, reduced T-cells, reduced natural killer cell maturation, and unmitigated plasmablast proliferation causing aberrant immunoglobulin G levels. The progression to severe disease is accompanied by endotheliopathy, immunothrombosis, and hypercoagulability. Thus, both parts of the immune system-innate and adaptive-play a significant role in the cytokine storm, multiorgan dysfunction, and coagulopathy. This review highlights the importance of understanding the immunological mechanisms of COVID-19 as they inform the clinical presentation and advise potential therapeutic targets.","Chau, Alice S; Weber, Andrew G; Maria, Naomi I; Narain, Sonali; Liu, Audrey; Hajizadeh, Negin; Malhotra, Prashant; Bloom, Ona; Marder, Galina; Kaplan, Blanka",Arthritis rheumatol.

The first infection from epidemic coronaviruses in 2003 fostered the spread of an overwhelming amount of related scientific efforts. The manifold aspects that have been raised, as well as their redundancy offer precious information that has been underexploited and needs to be critically re-evaluated, appropriately used and offered to the whole community, from scientists, to medical doctors, stakeholders and common people. These efforts will favour a holistic view on the comprehension, prevention and development of strategies (pharmacological, clinical etc) as well as common intervention against the new coronavirus spreading. Here we describe a model that emerged from our analysis that was focused on the Renin Angiotensin System (RAS) and the possible routes linking it to the viral infection. because the infection is mediated by the viral receptor on human cell membranes Angiotensin Converting Enzyme (ACE2), which is a key component in RAS signalling. The model depicts the main pathways determining the disease and the molecular framework for its establishment, and can help to shed light on mechanisms involved in the infection. It promptly gives an answer to some of the controversial, and still open, issues concerning predisposing conditions and medical treatments that protect from or favour the severity of the disease (such as the use of ACE inhibitors or ARBs/sartans), or to the sex related biases in the affected population. The model highlights novel opportunities for further investigations, diagnosis and appropriate intervention to understand and fight COVID19.","Chiusano, Maria Luisa",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.11614v1.pdf,416

With social distancing becoming the new standard in this age of COVID-19, telemedicine emerges as a key tool in continuing patient care without interruption. In this pilot study, we examine the reliability of acne vulgaris diagnostic assessments made via patient-taken photos compared to in-office assessments in patients between the ages of 16 and 23 with mild to moderate acne. Fourteen patient encounters were clinically examined for three outcomes: inflammatory lesions, noninflammatory acne lesions, and facial nodules. On the same day patient outcomes were counted and recorded in-person, patients were instructed to photograph their faces. These images were reviewed 8&ndash;12 weeks later by investigators for the same assessment.

227579,Rapid recovery achieved by intensive therapy after preterm cesarean section for worsening COVID-19-induced acute respiratory failure: A case report and literature review,2021,"BACKGROUND: Pharmacists have long been involved in public health and emergency preparedness and response (EP&R), including through preventive measures such as screening, vaccinations, testing, medical and pharmaceutical countermeasures, as well as ensuring medication safety and access during natural disasters and pandemics. Pharmacy professionals are considered essential partners in response to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Community and hospital pharmacies are expanding services and hours to provide essential services, putting pharmacists and their co-workers at the frontlines for patient care and safety to improve public health. In addition, pharmacy professionals are increasingly integrating into global, national, state and local EP&R efforts, including into interprofessional teams, such as Medical Reserve Corps (MRCs). However, lacunae exist for further integration of pharmacists into public health and safety initiatives. There are increasing opportunities and recommendations that should be expanded upon to provide improved patient care and population health interventions, and to ensure healthcare worker and public health safety. OBJECTIVE: Develop a Pharmacy Emergency Preparedness and Response (PEPR) Framework and recommendations for pharmacy professional pathways towards full integration within public health EP&R efforts (such as the COVID-19 pandemic), and enhanced recognition of pharmacists' skills, roles and contributions as integral members of the interprofessional healthcare team. METHODS: This paper draws on the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists (ASHP) 2003 Statement on the Role of Health-System Pharmacists in Emergency Preparedness and lessons learned from previous and current public health emergencies, such as the 2009 H1N1 pandemic and the current COVID-19 pandemic, to provide expanded guidance for pharmacists and pharmacy professionals across all practice settings in EP&R. The proposed PEPR framework also incorporates information and recommendations from The Pharmacy Organizations' Joint Policy Recommendations to Combat the COVID-19 Pandemic (March 2020), CDC-NIOSH, International Pharmaceutical Federation (FIP) Guidance, health departments and emergency preparedness guidance and resources, Boards of Pharmacy, and other pharmacy professional organizations and educational institutions. RESULTS: Based on methods and resources utilized in developing this proposed PEPR Framework, five key focus areas were identified, as follows: CONCLUSION: Pharmacists and pharmacy professionals have been at the frontlines in responding to the COVID-19 pandemic. Yet, challenges remain, such as limited availability of personal protection equipment, high risk of infectious exposures inherent in healthcare professions, and legislative hurdles resulting in lack of provider status and related reimbursements. Recommendations to enhance pharmacy's scope as public health professionals involved in EP&R include targeted training and education on key framework areas and policymaking. Pharmacy professionals should further integrate with interdisciplinary public health teams. Additional research and dissemination on impacts and outcomes of EP&R can enhance recognition of pharmacy professionals' contribution and value during public health emergencies. The proposed PEPR Framework can be utilized to develop, implement, evaluate, and disseminate results in order to strengthen existing efforts and to establish new initiatives in EP&R.","Aruru, Meghana; Truong, Hoai-An; Clark, Suzanne",Res. soc. adm. pharm,,416

Such effects may be particularly pronounced amongst adolescents and young people living in contexts of precarity and constraint, including in South Africa. However, there are evidence gaps on the lived experiences of this group. We conducted telephonic semi-structured interviews with adolescents and young people in two South African provinces (n = 12, ages 18-25) in April 2020 to explore and document their experiences, challenges and coping strategies during strict COVID-19 lockdown. Participants described indirect effects of COVID-19 including food insecurity, lost livelihoods and changes to social service provisions such as municipal electricity services and sanitation. Psychosocial stressors related to uncertainty over education and work futures were also discussed. The aforementioned challenges were particularly present with young parents, 'working poor' participants, and those with pre-existing mental health challenges.

228220,[Acute pancreatitis in children with COVID-19-associated multisystem inflammatory syndrome]./ Pancreatitis aguda en paciente pediátrico afecto de síndrome inflamatorio multisistémico atribuido a COVID-19,2021,"BACKGROUND: In Italy, a nationwide full lockdown was declared between March and May 2020 to hinder the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. The potential individual health effects of long-term isolation are largely unknown. The current study investigated the arrhythmic consequences of the COVID-19 lockdown in patients with defibrillators (ICDs) living in the province of Ferrara, Italy. METHODS: Both the arrhythmias and the delivered ICD therapies as notified by the devices were prospectively collected during the lockdown period (P1) and compared to those occurred during the 10 weeks before the lockdown began (P2) and during the same period in 2019 (P3). Changes in outcome over the three study periods were evaluated for significance using McNemar's test. RESULTS: A total of 413 patients were included in the analysis. No differences were found concerning either arrhythmias or shocks or anti-tachycardia pacing. Only the number of patients experiencing non-sustained ventricular tachycardias (NSVTs) during P1 significantly decreased as compared to P2 (p = 0.026) and P3 (p = 0.009). The subgroup analysis showed a significant decrease in NSVTs during P1 for men (vs. P2, p = 0.014; vs. P3, p = 0.040) and younger patients (vs. P2, p = 0.002; vs. P3, p = 0.040) and for ischemic etiology (vs. P2, p = 0.003). No arrhythmic deaths occurred during P1. CONCLUSIONS: The complete nationwide lockdown, as declared by the Italian government during the first COVID-19 pandemic peak, did not impact on the incidence of arrhythmias in an urban cohort of patients with ICDs.","Sassone, Biagio; Virzì, Santo; Bertini, Matteo; Pasanisi, Giovanni; Manzoli, Lamberto; Myers, Jonathan; Grazzi, Giovanni; Muser, Daniele",Pacing Clin Electrophysiol,,416

Answer: towards our collective rational human condition right now and right here, namely, during the roll-out and fall-out of the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic, at The End of the World More precisely, we are claiming that the past 120 years of civilization have effectively driven humanity into a veritable cul de sac, a dead end for rational human civilization As a consequence, we most urgently need to retrace our steps, identify a philosophico-cultural version of Robert Frost's ""road not taken"" that briefly appeared between 1900 and 1940, and then correspondingly revolutionize our thinking towards a philosophy of the future that can and should extend beyond The End of the World and into the next four decades of the 21st century We call this philosophy of the future new wave organicism","Hanna, Robert Paans Otto",Cosmos and History-the Journal of Natural and Social Philosophy,,416

Several classes of maintenance drugs have attracted attention because of their potential to affect susceptibility to and severity of COVID-19. MethodsUsing claims data on 20% random sample of Part D Medicare enrollees from April to December 2020, we identified patients diagnosed with COVID-19. Using a nested case-control design, non-COVID-19 controls were identified by 1:5 matching on age, race, sex, dual-eligibility status and geographical region. We identified usage of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI), angiotensin-receptor blockers (ARB), warfarin, direct factor Xa inhibitors, clopidogrel, famotidine and hydroxychloroquine based on Medicare prescription claims data. Using extended Cox regression models with time-varying propensity score adjustment we examined the independent effect of each study drug on contracting COVID-19. For severity of COVID-19, we performed extended Cox regressions on all COVID-19 patients, using COVID-19-related hospitalization and all-cause mortality as outcomes. Covariates included gender, age, race, geographic region, low-income indicator and co-morbidities. To compensate for indication bias related to the use of hydroxychloroquine for the prophylaxis or treatment of COVID-19, we censored patients who only started on hydroxychloroquine in 2020. ResultsUp to December 2020, our sample contained 374,229 Medicare patients over 65 who were diagnosed with COVID-19. Among the COVID-19 patients, 209,208 (55.9%) were on at least one study drug. The three most common study drugs were ACEI 97,872 (26.1%), ARB 83,329 (22.3%) and clopidogrel 38,203 (10.2%). Current users of ACEI, ARB, warfarin, direct factor Xa inhibitor and clopidogrel were associated with reduced risk of getting COVID-19 (3-13%), and reduced risk of dying after a COVID-19 diagnosis (8-19%). Famotidine did not show consistent significant effects. Hydroxychloroquine did not show significant effects after censoring of recent starters. ConclusionsMaintenance use of ACEI, ARB, warfarin, direct factor Xa inhibitor and clopidogrel was associated with reduction in risk of acquiring COVID-19 and dying from it.","Fung, Kin Wah; Baik, Seo; Baye, Fitsum; Zheng, Zhaonian; Huser, Vojtech; McDonald, Clem",,,416

While there is an increase in the usage of cosmetic products, it is concerning whether the consumers are aware of the safety of the products. AIMS: This study aimed to widely explore consumers' perceptions and attitudes toward cosmetics within the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was carried out among adults in Selangor, Malaysia. Thirty-three questions divided into three dimensions (socio-demographic parameters, assessment of perception, and assessment of attitude) were developed and validated to be answered by cosmetics consumers. Descriptive and inferential statistical analysis was done using SPSS. RESULTS: A response rate of 87% was achieved, and the mean age of participants was 33 ± 7.2. The overall perception of consumers indicates low levels of perception and moderate level of attitude toward cosmetic products. There was a positive correlation and high relationship between participants' perception and attitude (p = 0.001, r = 0.72). A significant association was observed between demographic data of respondents and their attitude and perception toward cosmetic products. Participants were unaware that sharing of cosmetic products could lead to bacterial infection and possibly increased the chance of contracting COVID-19. CONCLUSION: This study displayed a nonchalant perception and attitude of Malaysian adults toward cosmetic products by focusing on aesthetics rather than health safety. Therefore, it is recommended to raise awareness on the composition and effects of cosmetic products, increase the practice of hygiene and dissuade the sharing of cosmetics to reduce transmissions of COVID-19.","Mohammed, Ali Haider; Blebil, Ali; Dujaili, Juman; Hassan, Bassam Abdul Rasool",J. cosmet. dermatol,,416

This is primarily attributed to the exaggerated immune response (inflammatory disease), which may prove detrimental to the host, as evidenced by SARS-CoV-2 infection. From the experiences of Novel Coronavirus Disease-19 to date, male patients are likely to suffer from high-intensity inflammation and disease severity than the female population. Hormones are considered the significant pillars of sex differences responsible for the discrepancy in immune response exhibited by males and females. Females appear to be better equipped to counter invading respiratory viral pathogens, including the novel SARS-CoV-2, than males. It can be hypothesized that females are more shielded from disease severity, probably owing to the diverse action/influence of estrogen and other sex hormones on both cellular (thymus-derived T lymphocytes) and humoral immunity (antibodies).","Vadakedath, Sabitha; Kandi, Venkataramana; Mohapatra, Ranjan K; Pinnelli, Venkata B K; Yegurla, Richa R; Shahapur, Praveen R; Godishala, Vikram; Natesan, Senthilkumar; Vora, Kranti S; Sharun, Khan; Tiwari, Ruchi; Bilal, Muhammad; Dhama, Kuldeep",J Med Virol,,416

Our analyses show a strong association between socioeconomic status and both COVID-19 outcomes and public health capacity. People living in municipalities with low socioeconomic status did not reduce their mobility during lockdowns as much as those in more affluent municipalities. Testing volumes may have been insufficient early in the pandemic in those places, and both test positivity rates and testing delays were much higher. We find a strong association between socioeconomic status and mortality, measured by either COVID-19-attributed deaths or excess deaths. Finally, we show that infection fatality rates in young people are higher in low-income municipalities.

We investigated whether patients seen in routine practice who meet common exclusion criteria recover differently from TKA compared to research-eligible patients. We hypothesized that research-ineligible patients would demonstrate poorer average postoperative function and slower rate of functional recovery compared to research-eligible patients. METHODS: Patient characteristics and exclusion criteria were extracted and summarized from trials included in the three most recent systematic reviews of TKA rehabilitation. Trial participant characteristics were compared to a clinical dataset of patient outcomes collected in routine TKA rehabilitation. Where possible, individual exclusion criterion from the trials were applied to the clinical dataset to determine ""eligible"" and ""ineligible"" groups for research participation. Postoperative functional outcomes including the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) and Timed Up and Go (TUG) were compared between ""eligible"" and ""ineligible"" groups using mixed effects models. RESULTS: 2,528 participants from 27 trials were compared to 474 patients from the clinical dataset. Research participants were older, with lower Body Mass Index than patients in the clinical dataset. Many patients in the clinical dataset would be ""ineligible"" for research participation based upon common exclusion criteria from the trials. Differences were observed in average postoperative functioning between some ""eligible"" and ""ineligible"" groups in the clinical dataset. However, no differences were observed in functional recovery rate between groups, except for patients with diabetes whose TUG recovered more slowly than their ""eligible"" counterparts. CONCLUSIONS: Many patients in the clinical dataset were ""ineligible"" for research participation based upon common TKA rehabilitation trial exclusion criteria. However, the postoperative recovery rate did not differ between ""eligible"" and ""ineligible"" groups based on individual exclusion criterion-except for individuals with diabetes. This suggests that both clinical and research populations may recover similarly from TKA.","Kittelson, Andrew J; Loyd, Brian J; Graber, Jeremy; Himawan, Michael A; Waugh, Dawn; Davenport, Jacqueline; Hoogeboom, Thomas J; Stevens-Lapsley, Jennifer",Journal of evaluation in clinical practice (Online),,416

Denoising using deep learning reconstruction (Advanced Intelligent Clear-IQ Engine [AiCE]) has been reported for CT and MR. The purpose of this study was to compare the contrast-to-noise ratio of endolymph to perilymph (CNREP) between the improved hybrid of reversed image of the positive endolymph signal and the native image of the perilymph signal multiplied with the heavily T2-weighted MR cisternography (iHYDROPS-Mi2) images, which used AiCE for the three source images (i.e. positive endolymph image [PEI], positive perilymph image [PPI], MR cisternography [MRC]) to those that did not use AiCE. We also examined if there was a difference between iHYDROPS-Mi2 images with and without AiCE for degree of visual grading of EH and in endolymphatic area [EL] ratios. METHODS: Nine patients with suspicion of EH were imaged on a 3T MR scanner. iHYDROPS images were generated by subtraction of PEI images from PPI images. iHYDROPS-Mi2 images were then generated by multiplying MRC with iHYDROPS images. The CNREP and EL ratio were measured on the iHYDROPS-Mi2 images. Degree of radiologist visual grading for EH was evaluated. RESULTS: Mean CNREP ± standard deviation was 1681.8 ± 845.2 without AiCE and 7738.6 ± 5149.2 with AiCE (P = 0.00002). There was no significant difference in EL ratio for images with and without AiCE. Radiologist grading for EH agreed completely between the 2 image types in both the cochlea and vestibule. CONCLUSION: The CNREP of iHYDROPS-Mi2 images with AiCE had more than a fourfold increase compared with that without AiCE. Use of AiCE did not adversely affect radiologist grading of EH.","Naganawa, Shinji; Nakamichi, Rei; Ichikawa, Kazushige; Kawamura, Mariko; Kawai, Hisashi; Yoshida, Tadao; Sone, Michihiko",,,416

With an unprecedented rate the different types of waste volume have up surged along with the COVID-19 contamination rate. As the situation has mandated people as well as the most infected persons to stay at home, the amount of generated hazardous waste is 3.40 kg that can be expected daily from each infected person. China and other countries have seen a massive increment in the hazardous waste generation (about 600 % increase in Hubei province) amount. While dealing with this sudden increase in waste amount, the conventional incineration facilities have been outstripped and waste management industry is facing an immense pressure over handling hazardous waste generated from COVID-19 infected patients. Alongside with the hazardous waste volume, single-use plastic items and personal protective equipment (PPEs) have induced a new type of ""PPE pollution"" in the land and aquatic environment.

Many researchers studied about its societal impacts in the countries that had implemented strong social distancing measures such as stay-at-home orders. Among them, human mobility has been studied extensively due to its importance in flattening the curve. However, mobility has not been actively studied in the context of mild social distancing. Insufficient understanding of human mobility in diverse contexts might provide limited implications for any technological interventions to alleviate the situation. To this end, we collected a dataset consisting of more than 1M daily smart device users in the third-largest city of South Korea, which has implemented mild social distancing policies. We analyze how COVID-19 shaped human mobility in the city from geographical, socio-economic, and socio-political perspectives. We also examine mobility changes for points of interest and special occasions such as transportation stations and the case of legislative elections. We identify a typology of populations through these analyses as a means to provide design implications for technological interventions.

To this end, we performed molecular dynamics simulations using crystal structures of apo and &#945;-ketoamide 13b-bound Mpro homodimer. Analysis of trajectories pertaining to apo Mpro revealed a new target site, which is located at the homodimer interface, next to the catalytic dyad. Thereafter, we performed ensemble-based virtual screening by exploiting the ZINC and DrugBank databases and identified three candidate molecules, namely eluxadoline, diosmin, and ZINC02948810 that could invoke local and global conformational rearrangements which were also elicited by &#945;-ketoamide 13b on the catalytic dyad of Mpro. Furthermore, ZINC23881687 stably interacted with catalytically important residues Glu166 and Ser1 and the target site throughout the simulation. However, it gave positive binding energy, presumably, due to displaying higher flexibility that might dominate the entropic term, which is not included in the MM-PBSA method. Finally, ZINC20425029, whose mode of action was different, modulated dynamical properties of catalytically important residue, Ala285. As such, this study presents valuable findings that might be used in the development of novel therapeutics against Mpro.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

247461,Mesenchymal stromal cell therapy for coronavirus disease 2019: which? when? and how much?,2021,"The current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has imposed new challenges and demands for health systems, especially in the development of new vaccine strategies. Vaccines for many pathogens were developed based on the display of foreign epitopes in the variable regions of the human adenovirus (HAdV) major capsid proteins (hexon, penton and fiber). The humoral immune response against the HAdV major capsid proteins was demonstrated to play a role in the development of an immune response against the epitopes in display. Through the immunoinformatic profiling of the major capsid proteins of HAdVs from different species, we developed a modular concept that can be used in the development of vaccines based on HAdV vectors. Our data suggests that different immunomodulatory potentials can be observed in the conserved regions, present in the hexon and penton proteins, from different species. Using this modular approach, we developed a HAdV-5 based vaccine strategy for SARS-CoV-2, constructed through the display of SARS-CoV-2 epitopes indicated by our prediction analysis as immunologically relevant. The sequences of the HAdV vector major capsid proteins were also edited to enhance the IFN-gamma induction and antigen presenting cells activation. This is the first study proposing a modular HAdV platform developed to aid the design of new vaccines by inducing an immune response more suited for the epitopes in display.","Porto, Pedro Soares; Anjos, Déborah; Dábilla, Nathânia; da Fonseca, Simone Gonçalves; Souza, Menira",Infect Genet Evol,,416

METHODS: We used data obtained from the Veterans Affairs Corporate Data Warehouse (CDW) between January 1st, 2020, and May 1st 2020 as an external validation cohort. The outcome measure was hospital mortality. Areas under the ROC (AUC) curves were used to evaluate discrimination of the four predictive models. The Hosmer-Lemeshow (HL) goodness-of-fit test and calibration curves assessed applicability of the models to individual cases. RESULTS: During the study period, 1634 unique patients were identified. The mean age of the study cohort was 68.8±13.4 years. Hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and heart disease were the most common comorbidities. The crude hospital mortality was 29% (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.27-0.31). Evaluation of the predictive models showed an AUC range from 0.63 (95% CI 0.60-0.66) to 0.72 (95% CI 0.69-0.74) indicating fair to poor discrimination across all models. There were no significant differences among the AUC values of the four prognostic systems. All models calibrated poorly by either overestimated or underestimated hospital mortality. CONCLUSIONS: All the four prognostic models examined in this study portend high-risk bias. The performance of these scores needs to be interpreted with caution in hospitalized patients with COVID-19.","El-Solh, Ali A; Lawson, Yolanda; Carter, Michael; El-Solh, Daniel A; Mergenhagen, Kari A",PLoS One,,416

In this study, we aimed to assess whether diabetes mellitus (DM) would increase the risk of severe infection and death in patients with COVID-19. METHODS: We systematically searched the PubMed, Web of Science, MedRxiv and COVID-19 academic research communication platform for studies reporting clinical severity and/or overall mortality data on DM in patients with COVID-19 published up to July 10, 2020. The primary outcome was to compare the severe infection rate and mortality rate in COVID-19 patients with and without DM, and to calculate the odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI). RESULTS: A total of 76 studies involving 31,067 patients with COVID-19 were included in our meta-analysis. COVID-19 patients with DM had higher severe infection and case-mortality rates compared with those without DM (21.4 vs. 10.6% and 28.5 vs. 13.3%, respectively, all p <0.01). COVID-19 patients with DM were at significantly elevated risk of severe infection (OR = 2.38, 95% CI: 2.05-2.78, p <0.001) and mortality (OR = 2.21, 95% CI: 1.83-2.66, p <0.001). CONCLUSION: DM is associated with increased risk of severe infection and higher mortality in patients with COVID-19. Our study suggests that clinicians should pay more attention to the monitoring and treatment of COVID-19 patients with DM.","Shang, Luxiang; Shao, Mengjiao; Guo, Qilong; Shi, Jia; Zhao, Yang; Xiaokereti, Jiasuoer; Tang, Baopeng",Arch Med Res,,416

259745,Simple 'Rule-of-6' predicts severe COVID-19 disease,2020,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has led to unprecedented challenges to healthcare systems worldwide. Orthopaedic departments have adopted business continuity models and guidelines for essential and non-essential surgeries to preserve hospital resources as well as protect patients and staff. These guidelines broadly encompass reduction of ambulatory care with a move towards telemedicine, redeployment of orthopaedic surgeons/residents to the frontline battle against COVID-19, continuation of education and research through web-based means, and cancellation of non-essential elective procedures. However, if containment of COVID-19 community spread is achieved, resumption of elective orthopaedic procedures and transition plans to return to normalcy must be considered for orthopaedic departments. The COVID-19 pandemic also presents a moral dilemma to the orthopaedic surgeon considering elective procedures. What is the best treatment for our patients and how does the fear of COVID-19 influence the risk-benefit discussion during a pandemic? Surgeons must deliberate the fine balance between elective surgery for a patient's wellbeing versus risks to the operating team and utilization of precious hospital resources. Attrition of healthcare workers or Orthopaedic surgeons from restarting elective procedures prematurely or in an unsafe manner may render us ill-equipped to handle the second wave of infections. This highlights the need to develop effective screening protocols or preoperative COVID-19 testing before elective procedures in high-risk, elderly individuals with comorbidities. Alternatively, high-risk individuals should be postponed until the risk of nosocomial COVID-19 infection is minimal. In addition, given the higher mortality and perioperative morbidity of patients with COVID-19 undergoing surgery, the decision to operate must be carefully deliberated. As we ramp-up elective services and get ""back to business"" as orthopaedic surgeons, we have to be constantly mindful to proceed in a cautious and calibrated fashion, delivering the best care, while maintaining utmost vigilance to prevent the resurgence of COVID-19 during this critical transition period.

The aim of this study was to develop a comprehensive model for the evaluation of websites of wood companies, as a review of the literature shows that such a model does not yet exist. In developing the model, we used an innovative approach and combined the analytic hierarchy process with R-TOPSIS (technique for order of preference by similarity to ideal solution), which is a novelty in this field. For the final website assessment, the Website Quality Index (WQI) was developed. The main difference to other indexes is that our model has a comprehensive content background (36 criteria and sub-criteria) and a strong mathematical basis, so that it can be used to independently evaluate a single website or to evaluate a larger group of websites from the same industry. We have tested the model on 60 websites of Slovenian wood industry companies with at least ten employees. The results show the low to moderate average quality of the websites, with an average WQI of all evaluated websites of 0.450, indicating only an acceptable website. It has proven to be easy to use, and the results show the reliability of the website rating. Additionally, the designed model is an im-portant tool for industry website developers and the basis for future studies in this field.

Recently, ACE2 was identified as the receptor of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the coronavirus that is causing the pandemic of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Since SARS-CoV-2 must bind with ACE2 before entering the host cells in humans, the distribution and expression of ACE2 may be critical for the target organ of the SARS-CoV-2 infection. Moreover, accumulating evidence has demonstrated the implication of ACE2 in the pathological progression in tissue injury and several chronic diseases, ACE2 may also be essential in the progression and clinical outcomes of COVID-19. Therefore, we summarized the expression and activity of ACE2 in various physiological and pathological conditions, and discussed its potential implication in the susceptibility of SARS-CoV-2 infection and the progression and prognosis of COVID-19 patients in the current review.","Li, Yanwei; Zhou, Wei; Yang, Li; You, Ran",Pharmacol Res,,416
266625,Safety and potential efficacy of cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors in coronavirus disease 2019,2020,"Fast and reliable tests for the new coronavirus are urgently needed. Current Polymerase Chain Reaction based virus detection approaches are typically time-consuming and expensive. Technologies capable of providing a fast, real-time and non-contact detection of virus contamination and real-time virus classification are not yet available. Here, we demonstrate the potential of a fluorescence detection technique along with machine-learning based classification for virus detection. The ultraviolet (UV) light irradiated virus emits a fluorescent signal with a characteristic spectrum, which is regarded as a fingerprint for the virus. We analyzed eight virus samples including a heat-inactivated SARS-CoV-2 (virus causing COVID-19) and collected a number of emission spectra. Machine learning techniques are applied to discriminate among the candidate viruses via classifying a number of spectra data collected. First, Principle Component Analysis (PCA) was applied to reduce spectra data dimensionality. Then support vector machine (SVM) with various kernel functions (kernel-SVM), k-nearest-neighbor (k-NN) and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) methods were used to classify these viruses with dimension-reduced data from PCA. We found that dimension-reduced data in 3 principal components (PCs) space performs better than that in 2 PCs space in the machine learning algorithms mentioned above. Variance ratio analysis is able to explain nearly 95% of variance which allows nearly 100% accuracy of predictions for 25% data test set randomly chosen from the whole dataset. Finally, cross validation (CV) analysis is applied to kernel-SVM and k-NN methods.","Huang, H. X.; Zhang, Y. L.; Gardner, R.; Kang, Z.

268650,Profiling Early Humoral Response to Diagnose Novel Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19),2020,"BACKGROUND: To the authors' knowledge, the impact of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic on cytopathology practices worldwide has not been investigated formally. In the current study, data from 41 respondents from 23 countries were reported. METHODS: Data regarding the activity of each cytopathology laboratory during 4 weeks of COVID-19 lockdown were collected and compared with those obtained during the corresponding period in 2019. The overall number and percentage of exfoliative and fine-needle aspiration cytology samples from each anatomic site were recorded. Differences in the malignancy and suspicious rates between the 2 periods were analyzed using a meta-analytical approach. RESULTS: Overall, the sample volume was lower compared with 2019 (104,319 samples vs 190,225 samples), with an average volume reduction of 45.3% (range, 0.1%-98.0%). The percentage of samples from the cervicovaginal tract, thyroid, and anorectal region was significantly reduced (P < .05). Conversely, the percentage of samples from the urinary tract, serous cavities, breast, lymph nodes, respiratory tract, salivary glands, central nervous system, gastrointestinal tract, pancreas, liver, and biliary tract increased (P < .05). An overall increase of 5.56% (95% CI, 3.77%-7.35%) in the malignancy rate in nongynecological samples during the COVID-19 pandemic was observed. When the suspicious category was included, the overall increase was 6.95% (95% CI, 4.63%-9.27%). CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in a drastic reduction in the total number of cytology specimens regardless of anatomic site or specimen type. The rate of malignancy increased, reflecting the prioritization of patients with cancer who were considered to be at high risk. Prospective monitoring of the effect of delays in access to health services during the lockdown period is warranted.","Vigliar, Elena; Cepurnaite, Rima; Alcaraz-Mateos, Eduardo; Ali, Syed Z; Baloch, Zubair W; Bellevicine, Claudio; Bongiovanni, Massimo; Botsun, Pavlina; Bruzzese, Dario; Bubendorf, Lukas; Büttner, Reinhard; Canberk, Sule; Capitanio, Arrigo; Casadio, Chiara; Cazacu, Eugeniu; Cochand-Priollet, Beatrix; D039,; Amuri, Alessandro; Eloy, Catarina; Engels, Marianne; Fadda, Guido; Fontanini, Gabriella; Fulciniti, Franco; Hofman, Paul; Iaccarino, Antonino; Ieni, Antonio; Jiang, Xiaoyin Sara; Kakudo, Kennichi; Kern, Izidor; Kholova, Ivana; Liu, Chinhua; Lobo, Anandi; Lozano, Maria D; Malapelle, Umberto; Maleki, Zahra; Michelow, Pamela; Musayev, Jamal; Özgün, Gonca; Oznur, Meltem; Peiró Marqués, Francisca Maria; Pisapia, Pasquale; Poller, David; Pyzlak, Michal; Robinson, Betsy; Rossi, Esther Diana; Roy-Chowdhuri, Sinchita; Saieg, Mauro; Savic Prince, Spasenija; Schmitt, Fernando C; Javier Seguí Iváñez, Francisco; Stoos-Veic, Tajana",Cancer Cytopathol,,416

A total of 2,020 participants provided responses to an online cross-sectional survey comprised of validated instruments including the Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support (MSPSS), the Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale (GAD-7), the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), the Brief Irritability Test (BITe) and the UCLA Loneliness Scale (UCLA-LS). Individuals experiencing self-isolation had significantly higher rates of depression, irritability and loneliness compared to those who were not. The risk for elevated levels of depression symptoms was 63% lower in individuals who reported higher levels of social support compared to those with low perceived social support. Similarly, those with high social support had a 52% lower risk of poor sleep quality compared to those with low social support. Social support was found to be significantly associated with elevated risk for depression and poorer sleep quality. The results contribute to our understanding of differential psychological outcomes for individuals experiencing anti-pandemic measures.","Grey, Ian; Arora, Teresa; Thomas, Justin; Saneh, Ahmad; Tohme, Pia; Abi-Habib, Rudy",Psychiatry Res,,416

We reported clinical and viroimmunological data of all HIV-positive patients admitted to our center with COVID-19 from March 1 to May 12, 2020. Overall, five patients were included: all were virologically-suppressed on antiretroviral therapy and CD4+ count was greater than 350 cell/mm3 in all but two patients. Although all patients had evidence of pneumonia on admission, only one developed respiratory failure. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) RNA was never detected from nasopharyngeal swabs in two patients, whereas in the others, viral clearance occurred within a maximum of 43 days. Immunoglobulin G production was elicited in all patients and neutralizing antibodies in all but one patient. Specific-T-cell response developed in all patients but was stronger in those with the more severe presentations. Similarly, the highest level of proinflammatory cytokines was found in the only patient experiencing respiratory failure. Despite a mild presentation, patients with more pronounced immunosuppression showed high degrees of both cytokines production and immune activation. Our study did not find an increased risk and severity of COVID-19 in PLWH. Adaptative cellular immune response to SARS-CoV-2 appeared to correlate to disease severity. The mild clinical picture showed in advanced HIV patients, despite a significant T-cell activation and inflammatory profile, suggests a potential role of HIV-driven immunological dysregulation in avoiding immune-pathogenetic processes. However, other possible explanations, as a protective role of certain antiretroviral drugs, should be considered. Further larger studies are needed to better clarify the impact of HIV infection on COVID-19.","Mondi, Annalisa; Cimini, Eleonora; Colavita, Francesca; Cicalini, Stefania; Pinnetti, Carmela; Matusali, Giulia; Casetti, Rita; Maeurer, Markus; Vergori, Alessandra; Mazzotta, Valentina; Gagliardini, Roberta; De Zottis, Federico; Schininà, Vincenzo; Girardi, Enrico; Puro, Vincenzo; Ippolito, Giuseppe; Vaia, Francesco; Capobianchi, Maria Rosaria; Castilletti, Concetta; Agrati, Chiara; Antinori, Andrea",J. med. virol,,416

Anxiety symptoms among older adults have been connected with various psychological outcomes, including social isolation and loneliness. During the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, many societies have demonstrated increased ageist attitudes, encouraging older adults to distance themselves from society. Accordingly, the current study examined the moderating role of COVID-19-related ageism in the connection between COVID-19 health worries and anxiety symptoms among older adults. Data were collected from 243 older adults (age range 60-92; M = 69.75, SD = 6.69), who completed scales assessing COVID-19-related health worries and ageism, as well as anxiety symptoms. The results demonstrated that both health worries and ageism were positively associated with anxiety symptoms. Moreover, the connection between health worries and anxiety symptoms was more pronounced among older adults with high ageism levels. The study highlights the vulnerability of older adults in general, and ageist older adults in particular, to the negative consequences of COVID-19-related health worries, and emphasizes the role of the increased ageist stance of society during the pandemic in this regard.","Bergman, Yoav S; Cohen-Fridel, Sara; Shrira, Amit; Bodner, Ehud; Palgi, Yuval",Int Psychogeriatr,,416

273828,Unusual Presentation of COVID-19 Disease Leading to Respiratory Distress and Coma,2021,"BACKGROUND: Diminished expression of human leukocyte antigen DR on circulating monocytes (mHLA-DR), measured by standardized flow cytometry procedure, is a reliable indicator of immunosuppression in severely injured intensive care unit patients. As such, it is used as stratification criteria in clinical trials evaluating novel immunostimulating therapies. Preanalytical constraints relative to the short delay between blood sampling and flow cytometry staining have nevertheless limited its use in multicentric studies. The objective of the present work was to compare mHLA-DR expression between whole blood samples simultaneously drawn in EDTA or Cyto-Chex BCT tubes. METHODS: In two university hospitals, mHLA-DR was assessed in fresh whole blood from septic patients (n = 12) and healthy donors (n = 6) simultaneously sampled on EDTA and Cyto-Chex BCT tubes. Staining was performed immediately after sampling and after blood storage at room temperature. RESULTS: We confirmed that samples collected in Cyto-Chex tube had substantially enhanced stability for mHLA-DR results (48-72 h) over those collected in EDTA. On baseline values, despite good correlation between tubes (r = 0.98, p < 0.001), mHLA-DR expression was systematically lower with Cyto-Chex BCT. CONCLUSION: The present reports confirms the potential of Cyto-Chex BCT tubes to stabilize mHLA-DR expression before staining and extends the work of Quadrini et al. [Cytometry B 2021;100:103-114]. In centers without rapid access to flow cytometry facilities, it enables to tolerate delays in mHLA-DR staining. However, a 30% gap exists between results obtained with EDTA and Cyto-Chex BCT tubes. As current thresholds for clinical decisions were obtained with EDTA samples, further studies are needed to confirm clinical thresholds with Cyto-Chex BCT tubes.","Hamada, Sarah; Jeannet, Robin; Gossez, Morgane; Cour, Martin; Argaud, Laurent; Francois, Bruno; Daix, Thomas; Venet, Fabienne; Monneret, Guillaume","Cytometry, Part B Clin. cytom",,416

275588,A Holistic Approach to Pathology Education During the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Pandemic,2021,"Background: Electroencephalographic (EEG) indicators for anaesthesia depth are being developed. Here, we propose novel EEG parameters created by using two kinds of waveforms discriminated by voltage thresholds from a new perspective. Methods: Six young-adult beagles and 6 senior beagles were anaesthetised with end-tidal sevoflurane (SEV) of 2.0%-4.0% in 0.5% intervals, and 2-channel EEG (256 Hz) was recorded. Two events were discriminated: a consecutive part ({\tau}) with a peak-to-peak potential difference (Vpp) within 1-6, 8, 12, or 20 mcrV, and another part (burst) with Vpp outside the threshold. Number of {\tau} (N{\tau}), mean {\tau} duration (M{\tau}), total percentage of {\tau} (SR{\tau}), mean burst duration (Mbst), and amplitude of burst (Abst) were evaluated as anaesthesia depth indicators using Pearsons correlation coefficients (r). Results: When Vpp was near the suppression wave threshold, N{\tau} had the highest correlation with SEV in both groups. As SEV was increased until onset of burst suppression, N{\tau} decreased, M{\tau} remained unchanged, and Mbst and Abst increased. In the young-adult group, mean |r| exceeded 0.95 for N{\tau} with Vpp of 4-6 mcrV, for Mbst with Vpp of 8-12 mcrV, and for Abst with Vpp of 4-12 mcrV. In the senior group, r exceeded 0.90 for N{\tau} with Vpp of 4 mcrV and for Abst with Vpp of 5-12 mcrV. Conclusion: We developed new EEG parameters that were almost perfectly correlated with volatile anaesthetic concentrations using traditional bipolar recording. This study suggests that the effect of anaesthetics on EEG can be investigated from two directions: pacemaker ({\tau}) and generator (burst).","Koyama, Chika; Haruna, Taichi; Hagihira, Satoshi; Yamashita, Kazuto",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1910.02768v1.pdf,416

Still, little is known about the impact of COVID-19-induced microscale damage in the lung on global lung dynamics. This review summarizes the key histological features of SARS-CoV-2 infected alveoli and links the findings to structural tissue changes and surfactant dysfunction affecting tissue mechanical behavior similar to changes seen in other lung injury. Along with typical findings of diffuse alveolar damage affecting the interstitium of the alveolar walls and blood-gas barrier in the alveolar airspace, COVID-19 can cause extensive microangiopathy in alveolar capillaries that further contribute to mechanical changes in the tissues and may differentiate it from previously studied infectious lung injury. Understanding microlevel damage impact on tissue mechanics allows for better understanding of macroscale respiratory dynamics. Knowledge gained from studies into the relationship between microscale and macroscale lung mechanics can allow for optimized treatments to improve patient outcomes in case of COVID-19 and future respiratory-spread pandemics.","Dimbath, Elizabeth; Maddipati, Veeranna; Stahl, Jennifer; Sewell, Kerry; Domire, Zachary; George, Stephanie; Vahdati, Ali",Life Sci,,416

Developing intelligent bioinformatics tools is a mandatory to aid in the analysis of the disease. One of these tools is local aligner which aims to find the longest common subsequence between two biological sequences. Fragmented local aligner technique (FLAT) was developed based on meta-heuristic algorithms to accelerating the alignment process, especially for sequences with huge length. In this paper, the performance of ions motion optimization (IMO) algorithm for implementing FLAT was measured. The performance was poor, and a chaotic parameter was added in the exploration equations of IMO to enhance its performance for FLAT. A set of real proteins having a product length which ranges from 250,000 to 9,000,000 were used as a dataset to test the performance of IMO and its developed version. Besides, COVID-19 virus was aligned using FLAT according to IMO and chaotic IMO to verify the enhancement of IMO. All results were compared to the results founded by Smith–Waterman approach. The tests prove the superiority of chaotic IMO over IMO for implementing FLAT on all datasets. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.","Issa, M.; Helmi, A.

Accordingly, a recent survey revealed that the majority of European healthcare professionals involved in stroke care are concerned that this lack of care will have a noticeable negative impact on functional outcomes. COVID-19 highlights an urgent need to rethink conventional neurorehabilitation and develop alternative approaches to provide high-quality therapy while minimizing hospital stays and visits. Technology-based solutions, such as, robotics bear high potential to enable such a paradigm shift. While robot-assisted therapy is already established in clinics, the future challenge is to enable physically assisted therapy and assessments in a minimally supervized and decentralized manner, ideally at the patient's home. Key enablers are new rehabilitation devices that are portable, scalable and equipped with clinical intelligence, remote monitoring and coaching capabilities. In this perspective article, we discuss clinical and technological requirements for the development and deployment of minimally supervized, robot-assisted neurorehabilitation technologies in patient's homes. We elaborate on key principles to ensure feasibility and acceptance, and on how artificial intelligence can be leveraged for embedding clinical knowledge for safe use and personalized therapy adaptation. Such new models are likely to impact neurorehabilitation beyond COVID-19, by providing broad access to sustained, high-quality and high-dose therapy maximizing long-term functional outcomes.","Lambercy, O.; Lehner, R.; Chua, K.; Wee, S.

285703,Epidemiology and clinical features of common community human coronavirus disease,2021,"PURPOSE: Physical distancing policies in the state of New South Wales (Australia) were implemented on March 23, 2020, because of the COVID-19 pandemic. This study investigated changes in physical activity, dietary behaviors, and well-being during the early period of this policy. METHODS: A cohort of young people aged 13-19 years from Sydney (N = 582) were prospectively followed for 22 weeks (November 18, 2019, to April 19, 2020). Daily, weekly, and monthly trajectories of diet, physical activity, sedentary behavior, well-being, and psychological distress were collected via smartphone, using a series of ecological momentary assessments and smartphone sensors. Differences in health and well-being outcomes were compared pre- and post-implementation of physical distancing guidelines. RESULTS: After the implementation of physical distancing measures in NSW, there were significant decreases in physical activity (odds ratio [OR] = .53, 95% confidence interval [CI] = .34-.83), increases in social media and Internet use (OR = 1.86, 95% CI = 1.15-3.00), and increased screen time based on participants' smartphone screen state. Physical distancing measures were also associated with being alone in the previous hour (OR = 2.09, 95% CI: 1.33-3.28), decreases in happiness (OR = .38, 95% CI = .18-.82), and fast food consumption (OR = .46, 95% CI = .29-.73). CONCLUSIONS: Physical distancing and social restrictions had a contemporaneous impact on health and well-being outcomes associated with chronic disease among young people. As the pandemic evolves, it will be important to consider how to mitigate against any longer term health impacts of physical distancing restrictions.","Munasinghe, Sithum; Sperandei, Sandro; Freebairn, Louise; Conroy, Elizabeth; Jani, Hir; Marjanovic, Sandra; Page, Andrew",J Adolesc Health,,416

But it is not clear yet whether BCG vaccination has a protective effect on COVID-19 infection on groups under risk such as healthcare workers (HCW) and elderly. In this study we evaluated the relation of BCG vaccination, tuberculosis skin test (TST) result and COVID-19 in HCW. Materials and methods: The study was designed as retrospective, case control study in the health care personnel working in pandemics clinics. The whole cases were divided to two groups as COVID-19 group (with a history of SARS CoV-2 infection) and control group (who did not suffer from COVID-19). Demographic data, TST, BCG scar and history for SARS CoV-2 infection were collected from hospital staff working in pandemics clinics between March 15, 2020 and November 15, 2020. In the cases suffered from COVID-19 the clinical and laboratory features and radiological severity of pneumonia -if present- and time for polymerase chain reaction (PCR) conversion in nasopharyngeal swab were recorded. All parameters were compared between two groups. Results: 148 HCW were included to the study. COVID-19 group included 68 (66.7%) females and 34 (33.3%) males (mean age: 36±9 years) and control group included 23 (50%) females and 23 (50%) males (mean age: 35±8 years). The mean value of TST for whole group was 6.3±7.6 mm and similar between groups. The number of cases with BCG scars were significantly more in COVID-19 group (p=0.04). In COVID-19 group 29 (28.4%) of the cases were hospitalized while only 1(1%) suffered from severe disease. None of the cases were died. No relation was found between TST value, positivity and presence of BCG scar with the laboratory parameters, clinical features, radiological severity and hospitalization rate (p&gt;0.05). The mean PCR conversion time was 10±3.7 days and similar in BCG and TST positive and negative cases(p&gt;0.05). Conclusion: BCG vaccination or a positive TST doesn’t have an effect on the susceptibility to and clinical course of COVID-19 in health care workers. © 2021 A. CARBONE Editore.

The characteristic clinical symptoms for Coronavirus (COVID-19) affected patients are high fever, dry-cough, dyspnoea, lethal pneumonia whereas some patients also show additional neurological signs such as headache, nausea, vomiting etc. The accumulative evidences suggest that SARS-CoV-2 is not only confined within the respiratory tract but may also invade the central nervous system (CNS) and peripheral nervous system (PNS) inducing some fatal neurological diseases. Here, we analyze the phylogenetic perspective of SARS-CoV-2 with other strains of ß-Coronaviridae from a standpoint of neurological spectrum disorders. METHODOLOGY: A Pubmed/Medline, NIH Lit Covid, Cochrane library and some open data bases (BioRxiv, MedRxiv,preprint.org and others) search were carried out by using keywords relevant to our topic of discussion. The extracted literatures are scrutinized by the authors. RESULTS: 58 literatures including original articles, case reports and case series were selected by the authors to analyze the differential distribution of neurological impairments in COVID-19 positive patients along with angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) expression dynamics in neuronal and non-neuronal tissue in CNS and PNS with neuroinvasive potential of SARS-CoV2. CONCLUSION: We discuss the need for modulations in clinical approach from a neurological point of view, as a measure towards reducing disease transmission, morbidity and mortality in SARS-CoV2 positive patients.","Lahiri, Durjoy; Mondal, Ritwick; Deb, Shramana; Bandyopadhyay, Deebya; Shome, Gourav; Sarkar, Sukanya; Biswas, Subhas C",Diabetes Metab Syndr,,416

On the basis of our analysis of hepatitis C virus and coronavirus replication, and the molecular structures and activities of viral inhibitors, we previously demonstrated that three nucleotide analogues (the triphosphates of Sofosbuvir, Alovudine, and AZT) inhibit the SARS-CoV RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). We also demonstrated that a library of additional nucleotide analogues terminate RNA synthesis catalyzed by the SARS-CoV-2 RdRp, a well-established drug target for COVID-19. Here, we used polymerase extension experiments to demonstrate that the active triphosphate form of Sofosbuvir (an FDA-approved hepatitis C drug) is incorporated by SARS-CoV-2 RdRp and blocks further incorporation. Using the molecular insight gained from the previous studies, we selected the active triphosphate forms of six other antiviral agents, Alovudine, Tenofovir alafenamide, AZT, Abacavir, Lamivudine, and Emtricitabine, for evaluation as inhibitors of the SARS-CoV-2 RdRp and demonstrated the ability of these viral polymerase inhibitors to be incorporated by SARS-CoV-2 RdRp, where they terminate further polymerase extension with varying efficiency. These results provide a molecular basis for inhibition of the SARS-CoV-2 RdRp by these nucleotide analogues. If sufficient efficacy of some of these FDA-approved drugs in inhibiting viral replication in cell culture is established, they may be explored as potential COVID-19 therapeutics.","Chien, Minchen; Anderson, Thomas K; Jockusch, Steffen; Tao, Chuanjuan; Li, Xiaoxu; Kumar, Shiv; Russo, James J; Kirchdoerfer, Robert N; Ju, Jingyue",J Proteome Res,,416

This study evaluated the impact of COVID-19 on GI fellowship training. Methods: A web-based questionnaire was sent out to GI fellows in Korea between 15 February and 15 March 2021. The questionnaire included questions regarding the characteristics of GI fellows, perception of COVID-19 outbreak, impact of COVID-19 outbreak, and telemedicine on the education of a GI fellowship. Results: Among 111 answers, 94 respondents were analyzed. The GI fellows were provided with sufficient information about the COVID-19 outbreak (74.7%), well educated, and provided with personal protective equipment use (74.7% and 83.9%, respectively). On the other hand, outpatient schedule and volume decreased in 25.5% and 37.8% of respondents, respectively. Moreover, endoscopy sessions and volume decreased in 51.1% and 65.6% of respondents, respectively. As a result, 78.9% of respondents were concerned that the COVID-19 outbreak adversely affected their education. Telemedicine utilization was introduced during the COVID-19 outbreak, but only 20.0% and 10.6% of respondents agreed that telemedicine has benefits from the patient's and doctor's perspectives, respectively. In addition, only 25.9% of respondents were willing to continue telemedicine if adequately reimbursed, and 68.2% of respondents were concerned that it adversely affected their education. Conclusions: The COVID-19 outbreak has adversely affected GI fellowship training in Korea for outpatient clinics, gastrointestinal endoscopy, educational conferences, and telemedicine. This study highlights that GI fellowship training needs more attention in the COVID-19 outbreak.","Shin, Hyun Phil; Cha, Jae Myung; Kim, Beom Kyung; Myung, Dae-Seong; Moon, Sung-Hoon; Song, Myeong Jun; Yoon, Seung Bae; Yoo, In Kyung; Lee, Jeong Hoon; Jun, Baek Gyu; Hyun, Jong Jin",Korean J Gastroenterol,,416
303583,Fallacies in medical practice: Renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibition and COVID-19 as a Paradigm,2020,"BACKGROUND: In March 2020, India declared a nationwide lockdown to control the spread of coronavirus disease 2019. As a result, control efforts against visceral leishmaniasis (VL) were interrupted. METHODS: Using an established age-structured deterministic VL transmission model, we predicted the impact of a 6- to 24-month programme interruption on the timeline towards achieving the VL elimination target as well as on the increase of VL cases. We also explored the potential impact of a mitigation strategy after the interruption. RESULTS: Delays towards the elimination target are estimated to range between 0 and 9 y. Highly endemic settings where control efforts have been ongoing for 5-8 y are most affected by an interruption, for which we identified a mitigation strategy to be most relevant. However, more importantly, all settings can expect an increase in the number of VL cases. This increase is substantial even for settings with a limited expected delay in achieving the elimination target. CONCLUSIONS: Besides implementing mitigation strategies, it is of great importance to try and keep the duration of the interruption as short as possible to prevent new individuals from becoming infected with VL and continue the efforts towards VL elimination as a public health problem in India.","Le Rutte, Epke A; Coffeng, Luc E; Muñoz, Johanna; de Vlas, Sake J",Trans R Soc Trop Med Hyg,,416

304504,"Epidemiological and clinical characteristics of 333 confirmed cases with coronavirus disease 2019 in Shanghai, China",2020,"To meet the educational, physical, social, and emotional needs of children, many U.S. schools opened for in-person learning during fall 2020 by implementing strategies to prevent transmission of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19 (1,2). To date, there have been no U.S. studies comparing COVID-19 incidence in schools that varied in implementing recommended prevention strategies, including mask requirements and ventilation improvements* (2). Using data from Georgia kindergarten through grade 5 (K-5) schools that opened for in-person learning during fall 2020, CDC and the Georgia Department of Public Health (GDPH) assessed the impact of school-level prevention strategies on incidence of COVID-19 among students and staff members before the availability of COVID-19 vaccines. Among 169 K-5 schools that participated in a survey on prevention strategies and reported COVID-19 cases during November 16-December 11, 2020, COVID-19 incidence was 3.08 cases among students and staff members per 500 enrolled students.§ Adjusting for county-level incidence, COVID-19 incidence was 37% lower in schools that required teachers and staff members to use masks, and 39% lower in schools that improved ventilation, compared with schools that did not use these prevention strategies. Ventilation strategies associated with lower school incidence included methods to dilute airborne particles alone by opening windows, opening doors, or using fans (35% lower incidence), or in combination with methods to filter airborne particles with high-efficiency particulate absorbing (HEPA) filtration with or without purification with ultraviolet germicidal irradiation (UVGI) (48% lower incidence). Multiple strategies should be implemented to prevent transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in schools (2); mask requirements for teachers and staff members and improved ventilation are important strategies that elementary schools could implement as part of a multicomponent approach to provide safer, in-person learning environments. Universal and correct mask use is still recommended by CDC for adults and children in schools regardless of vaccination status (2).","Gettings, Jenna; Czarnik, Michaila; Morris, Elana; Haller, Elizabeth; Thompson-Paul, Angela M; Rasberry, Catherine; Lanzieri, Tatiana M; Smith-Grant, Jennifer; Aholou, Tiffiany Michelle; Thomas, Ebony; Drenzek, Cherie; MacKellar, Duncan",MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep,,416
304629,ERACODA: the European database collecting clinical information of patients on kidney replacement therapy with COVID-19,2020,"BACKGROUNDCoronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is more benign in children compared with adults for unknown reasons. This contrasts with other respiratory viruses where disease manifestations are often more severe in children. We hypothesize that a more robust early innate immune response to SARS coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) protects against severe disease.METHODSClinical outcomes, SARS-CoV-2 viral copies, and cellular gene expression were compared in nasopharyngeal swabs obtained at the time of presentation to the emergency department from 12 children and 27 adults using bulk RNA sequencing and quantitative reverse-transcription PCR. Total protein, cytokines, and anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgA were quantified in nasal fluid.RESULTSSARS-CoV-2 copies, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, and TMPRSS2 gene expression were similar in children and adults, but children displayed higher expression of genes associated with IFN signaling, NLRP3 inflammasome, and other innate pathways. Higher levels of IFN-&#945;2, IFN-Î³, IP-10, IL-8, and IL-1ß protein were detected in nasal fluid in children versus adults. Children also expressed higher levels of genes associated with immune cells, whereas expression of those associated with epithelial cells did not differ in children versus adults. Anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgA and IgG were detected at similar levels in nasal fluid from both groups. None of the children required supplemental oxygen, whereas 7 adults did (P = 0.03); 4 adults died.CONCLUSIONThese findings provide direct evidence of a more vigorous early mucosal immune response in children compared with adults and suggest that this contributes to favorable clinical outcomes.FUNDINGNIH grants R01 AI134367, UL1 TR002556, T32 AI007501, T32GM007288, P30 AI124414; an Albert Einstein College of Medicine Dean's COVID-19 Pilot Research Award; and the Eric J.

305900,Pandemic Crises: The Anthropocene as Pathogenic Cycle,2020,"BackgroundThe World Health Organizations ""Coordinated Global Research Roadmap: 2019 Novel Coronavirus"" outlined the need for research that focuses on the impact of COVID-19 on pregnant women and children. More than one year after the first reported case, significant knowledge gaps remain, highlighting the need for a coordinated approach. To address this need, the Maternal, Newborn and Child Health Working Group (MNCH WG) of the COVID-19 Clinical Research Coalition conducted an international survey to identify global research priorities for COVID-19 in maternal, reproductive and child health. MethodThis project was undertaken using a modified Delphi method. An electronic questionnaire was disseminated to clinicians and researchers in three different languages (English, French and Spanish) via MNCH WG affiliated networks. Respondents were asked to select the five most urgent research priorities among a list of 17 identified by the MNCH WG. Analysis of questionnaire data was undertaken to identify key similarities and differences among respondents according to questionnaire language, location and specialty. Following elimination of the seven lowest ranking priorities, the questionnaire was recirculated to the original pool of respondents. Thematic analysis of final questionnaire data was undertaken by the MNCH WG from which four priority research themes emerged. ResultsQuestionnaire 1 was completed by 225 respondents from 29 countries. Questionnaire 2 was returned by 49 respondents. The four priority research themes were 1) access to healthcare during the COVID-19 pandemic, 2) the direct and 3) indirect effects of COVID-19 on pregnant and breastfeeding women and children and 4) the transmission of COVID-19 and protection from infection. ConclusionThe results of these questionnaires indicated a high level of concordance among continents and specialties regarding priority research themes. This prioritized list of research uncertainties, developed to specifically highlight the most urgent clinical needs as perceived by healthcare professionals and researchers, could help funding organizations and researchers to answer the most pressing questions for clinicians and public health professionals during the pandemic. It is hoped that these identified priority research themes can help focus the discussion regarding the allocation of limited resources to enhance COVID-19 research in MNCH globally.","Etti, Melanie; Alger, Jackeline; Salas, Sofia P; Saggers, Robin; Ramdin, Tanusha; Endler, Margit; Gemzell-Danielsson, Kristina; Alfven, Tobias; Ahmed, Yusuf; Callejas, Allison; Eskenazi, Deborah; Khalil, Asma; Doare, Kirsty Le",,,416

Various comorbidities are associated with worse disease prognosis. Understanding the impact of ethnicity on the disease outcome is an important public health issue but data from our region is lacking. Aim: We aim to identify comorbidities among patients hospitalized for COVID-19 that are associated with inhospital death. Also, to assess if ethnicity is correlated with increased risk of death. Patients and Method. The study is a single-centre, observational study in Shaikh Shakhbout Medical City, Abu Dhabi. Patients admitted with COVID-19, between 1st of March and the end of May, were enrolled. Records were studied for demography, comorbidity, and ethnicity. Ethnicity was divided into Arabs (Gulf, North Africa, and the Levant), South Asia (India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Nepal, and Afghanistan), Africans, the Philippines, and others. The study was approved by the Department of Health of Abu Dhabi. Results: 1075 patients (972 males) were enrolled. There were 24 nationalities under 5 ethnicity groups. Mean (average) age was 51 years (20-81). 101 (9.4%) died with deceased patients being significantly older. Death risk was not significantly influenced by sex. Duration of hospitalization among survivors was 6.2 days (0.2-40.4) with older patients and men staying longer (P < 0.01). Comorbidities of diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, chronic renal disease, liver disease, and malignancy were associated with higher risk of mortality univariate, but only liver disease reached statistical significance after adjustment for age. The highest percentage of death was seen in Arab Levant (21.2) followed by the Asian Afghan (18.8); however, differences among ethnicities did not reach statistical significance (P = 0.086).

METHODS: Key population-level disease projections in deaths, intensive care unit bed days, and non-intensive care unit bed days were taken from the Imperial College COVID-19 Response Team report of March 2020, which influenced the decision to introduce suppression policies in the United Kingdom. National income loss estimates were from a study that estimated the impact of a hypothetical pandemic on the UK economy, with sensitivity analyses based on projections that are more recent. Individual quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) loss and costed resource use inputs were taken from published sources. RESULTS: Imperial model projected suppression polices compared to an unmitigated pandemic, even with the most pessimistic national income loss scenarios under suppression (10%), give incremental cost-effectiveness ratios below £50 000 per QALY. Assuming a maximum reduction in national income of 7.75%, incremental cost-effectiveness ratios for Imperial model projected suppression versus mitigation are below 60 000 per QALY. CONCLUSIONS: Results are uncertain and conditional on the accuracy of the Imperial model projections; they are also sensitive to estimates of national income loss. Nevertheless, it would be difficult to claim that the hypothetical Imperial model-projected suppression policies are obviously cost-ineffective relative to the alternatives available. Despite evolving differences between government policy and Imperial model-projected suppression policy, it is hoped this article will provide some early insight into the trade-offs that are involved.","Zala, Darshan; Mosweu, Iris; Critchlow, Simone; Romeo, Renee; McCrone, Paul",Value Health,,416

We investigated the managers' views on their roles, challenges and developmental ideas in promoting good HH practice. METHODS: A descriptive cross-sectional study with an online survey of both medical and nursing managers was conducted within a single tertiary care hospital in Finland. Three open-ended questions were analyzed using inductive content analysis. RESULTS: A total of 78 managers out of 168 responded to the survey (response rate 46%). Managers helped promote HH practices by enabling the proper environment for adherence to good HH, visible commitment, and using various means to instruct staff about HH. Challenges included the acute hospital setting and practical problems related to the managers' numerous responsibilities.

324629,Case Report: Use of Anakinra in Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome During COVID-19 Pandemic,2020,"The coronavirus disease, named COVID-19, has become the largest global public health crisis since it started in early 2020. CT imaging has been used as a complementary tool to assist early screening, especially for the rapid identification of COVID-19 cases from community acquired pneumonia (CAP) cases. The main challenge in early screening is how to model the confusing cases in the COVID-19 and CAP groups, with very similar clinical manifestations and imaging features. To tackle this challenge, we propose an Uncertainty Vertex-weighted Hypergraph Learning (UVHL) method to identify COVID-19 from CAP using CT images. In particular, multiple types of features (including regional features and radiomics features) are first extracted from CT image for each case. Then, the relationship among different cases is formulated by a hypergraph structure, with each case represented as a vertex in the hypergraph. The uncertainty of each vertex is further computed with an uncertainty score measurement and used as a weight in the hypergraph. Finally, a learning process of the vertex-weighted hypergraph is used to predict whether a new testing case belongs to COVID-19 or not. Experiments on a large multi-center pneumonia dataset, consisting of 2,148 COVID-19 cases and 1,182 CAP cases from five hospitals, are conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed method. Results demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our proposed method on the identification of COVID-19 in comparison to state-of-the-art methods.","Di, Donglin; Shi, Feng; Yan, Fuhua; Xia, Liming; Mo, Zhanhao; Ding, Zhongxiang; Shan, Fei; Li, Shengrui; Wei, Ying; Shao, Ying; Han, Miaofei; Gao, Yaozong; Sui, He; Gao, Yue; Shen, Dinggang",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.04043v1.pdf,416

We simulate the 2018 CDC Vaccine Allocation guidelines using data from the American Community Survey under different assumptions on total vaccine supply. Black and Indigenous individuals combined receive a higher share of vaccines compared to their population share for all assumptions on total vaccine supply. However, their vaccine share under the 2018 CDC guidelines is considerably lower than their share of COVID-19 deaths and age-adjusted deaths. We then simulate one method to incorporate disadvantage in vaccine allocation via a reserve system. In a reserve system, units are placed into categories and units reserved for a category give preferential treatment to individuals from that category. Using the Area Deprivation Index (ADI) as a proxy for disadvantage, we show that a 40% high-ADI reserve increases the number of vaccines allocated to Black or Indigenous individuals, with a share that approaches their COVID-19 death share when there are about 75 million units. Our findings illustrate that whether an allocation is equitable depends crucially on the benchmark and highlight the importance of considering the expected distribution of outcomes from implementing vaccine allocation guidelines.","Pathak, Parag A.; Schmidt, Harald; Solomon, Adam; Song, Edwin; Sonmez, Tayfun; Unver, M.

This paper explores issues recruiting a representative resident cohort, as background to a study of residents, to acquire sociodemographic, health and disability data and trial an intervention designed to improve outcomes. METHODS: We planned approaching all Auckland/Waitemata District villages and, via managers, contacting residents ('letter-drop'; 'door-knocks'). In 'small' villages (n &#8804; 60 units), we planned contacting all residents, randomly selecting in 'larger' villages. We excluded those with doubtful or absent legal capacity. RESULTS: We approached managers of 53 of 65 villages. Thirty-four permitted recruitment. Some prohibited 'letter-drops' and/or 'door-knocks'. Hence, we recruited volunteers (23 villages) via meetings, posters, newsletters and word-of-mouth, that is representative sampling obtained from 11/34 villages. We recruited 578 residents (median age = 82 years; 420 = female; 217:361 sampled:volunteers), finding differences in baseline parameters of sampled vs. volunteers. CONCLUSION: Due to organisational/managers' policy, and national legislation restrictions, our sample does not represent our intended population well. Researchers should investigate alternative data sources, for example electoral rolls and censuses.","Joseph Connolly, Martin; Hikaka, Joanna; Bloomfield, Katherine; Broad, Joanna; Wu, Zhenqiang; Boyd, Michal; Peri, Kathy; Calvert, Cheryl; Tatton, Annie; Higgins, Ann-Marie; Bramley, Dale",Australasian journal on ageing (Online),,416

This review considers recent summaries of complications and looks toward strategies to improve practice using a coordinated approach. Recent Findings: A safety gap can exist between national recommendations and local practice. A lack of attention to end tidal carbon dioxide has repeatedly contributed to airway mismanagement. Clinicians must be trained in newer airway devices (videolaryngoscopes or supraglottic airways) to use them effectively. Time must be found to teach rarely performed skills (e.g., front-of-neck access). Both larger and smaller hospitals have benefitted from an airway lead or response team, coordinating education programs, ensuring the adoption of guidelines, standardizing equipment, and recognizing the role of human factors and ergonomics. Summary: Even in the twenty-first century, the incidence of airway-related morbidity and mortality can be reduced, by an institutionally supported, coordinated approach to the whole process of airway care.","Smith, Carolyn; McNarry, Alistair F",Curr Anesthesiol Rep,,416

Data on the clinical characteristics, laboratory parameters and prognosis of COVID-19 patients with or without cerebral stroke were collected and comparatively analysed. Of the 2474 COVID-19 patients, 113 (4.7%) patients had cerebral stroke, and 25 (1.0%) patients had new-onset stroke. Eighty-eight (77.9%) patients in the previous-stroke group had cerebral ischaemia, while 25 (22.1%) patients in the new-onset stroke group had cerebral ischaemia. Most COVID-19 patients with stroke were elderly with more comorbidities, such as hypertension, diabetes and heart diseases than patients without stroke. Laboratory examinations showed hypercoagulation and elevated serum parameters such as IL-6, cTnI, NT pro-BNP and BUN.

In addition, age, male sex and hypertension were independent predictors for new cerebral stroke in COVID-19 patients. In conclusion, the high risk of new-onset stroke must be taken into consideration when treating COVID-19 patients with an elderly age combined with a history of hypertension.

In addition, investigators included all patients &#8805; 18 years with a TB diagnosis in two different periods: from March 15th to June 30th of 2020 and March 15th to June 30th, 2019. Clinical variables and information about household contacts were retrospectively collected. RESULTS: Seven (70%) TB Units reported changes in the TB team usual operation. A total of 169 patients were diagnosed with active TB in both periods of study (90 in 2019 and 79 in 2020). Patients diagnosed in 2020 showed more frequently bilateral lesions in CXR compared with patients diagnosed in 2019 (p = 0·004). A higher percentage of LTBI and active TB among children household contacts of patients diagnosed in 2020 compared to patients diagnosed in 2019 (p = 0·001) was observed.

Spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 is cleaved into two segments, the S1 (res. 1-685) and the S2 (res. 686-1273) domain by furin protease. Nrp1 predominantly binds to the C-terminal RRAR motif (res. 682-685) of the S1 domain. In this study, we firstly modeled the association of a Nrp1 protein (consisting of domains a2-b1-b2) with the Spike protein. Next, we studied the separation of S2 from the S1 domain, with and without Nrp1 bound, by utilizing molecular dynamics pulling simulations. During the separation, Nrp1 stabilizes the S1 C-terminal region (res. 640-685) and thereby assists the detachment of S2 N-terminal region (res. 686-700). Without Nrp1 bound, S1 tends to become stretched and thus the bound Nrp1 stimulates the earlier separation of S2 from the S1 domain. The liberated S2 domain is known to mediate the fusion of virus and host membranes, thus Nrp1 likely increases virus infectivity by facilitating the S1/S2 separation. We further analyzed the possible topological structure of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein when bound with Nrp1 and ACE2. Understanding of such a Nrp1-assisted viral infection opens the gate for the generation of protein-protein inhibitors, such as antibodies, which could attenuate the infection mechanism and protect certain cells in a future Nrp1:ACE2 targeted combination therapy.","Zhen-Lu, Li; Matthias, Buck",Biophys. j,,416
337404,Review of Emerging Pharmacotherapy for the Treatment of Coronavirus Disease 2019,2020,"We present a narrow-band imaging survey of the Large Magellanic Cloud, designed to isolate the C II $\lambda\lambda$7231, 7236 emission lines in objects as faint as $m_{\lambda7400}\sim18$. The work is motivated by the recent serendipitous discovery in the LMC of the first confirmed extragalactic [WC11] star, whose spectrum is dominated by C II emission, and the realization that the number of such objects is currently largely unconstrained. The survey, which imaged $\sim$50$~$deg$^2$ using on-band and off-band filters, will significantly increase the total census of these rare stars. In addition, each new LMC [WC] star has a known luminosity, a quantity quite uncertain in the Galactic sample. Multiple known C II emitters were easily recovered, validating the survey design. We find 38 new C II emission candidates; spectroscopy of the complete sample will be needed to ascertain their nature. In a preliminary spectroscopic reconnaissance, we observed three candidates, finding C II emission in each. One is a new [WC11]. Another shows both the narrow C II emission lines characteristic of a [WC11], but also broad emission of C IV, O V, and He II characteristic of a much hotter [WC4] star; we speculate that this is a binary [WC]. The third object shows weak C II emission, but the spectrum is dominated by a dense thicket of strong absorption lines, including numerous O II transitions. We conclude it is likely an unusual hot, hydrogen-poor post-AGB star, possibly in transition from [WC] to white dwarf. Even lacking a complete spectroscopic program, we can infer that late [WC] stars do not dominate the central stars of LMC planetary nebulae, and that the detected C II emitters are largely of an old population.","Margon, Bruce; Massey, Philip; Neugent, Kathryn F.; Morrell, Nidia",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.04333v1.pdf,416

An incomplete understanding of immune correlates of protection represents a major barrier to the design of vaccines and therapeutic approaches to prevent infection or limit disease. This deficit is largely due to the lack of prospectively collected, pre-infection samples from individuals that go on to become infected with SARS-CoV-2. Here, we utilized data from genetically diverse Collaborative Cross (CC) mice infected with SARS-CoV to determine whether baseline T cell signatures are associated with a lack of viral control and severe disease upon infection. SARS-CoV infection of CC mice results in a variety of viral load trajectories and disease outcomes. Overall, a dysregulated, pro-inflammatory signature of circulating T cells at baseline was associated with severe disease upon infection. Our study serves as proof of concept that circulating T cell signatures at baseline can predict clinical and virologic outcomes upon SARS-CoV infection. Identification of basal immune predictors in humans could allow for identification of individuals at highest risk of severe clinical and virologic outcomes upon infection, who may thus most benefit from available clinical interventions to restrict infection and disease.","Graham, Jessica B; Swarts, Jessica L; Leist, Sarah R; Schäfer, Alexandra; Menachery, Vineet D; Gralinski, Lisa E; Jeng, Sophia; Miller, Darla R; Mooney, Michael A; McWeeney, Shannon K; Ferris, Martin T; Pardo-Manuel de Villena, Fernando; Heise, Mark T; Baric, Ralph S; Lund, Jennifer M",PLoS Pathog,,416

340269,When a pandemic intensifies racial terror,2020,"BACKGROUND: Physical-distancing interventions are being used in Canada to slow the spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, but it is not clear how effective they will be. We evaluated how different nonpharmaceutical interventions could be used to control the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and reduce the burden on the health care system. METHODS: We used an age-structured compartmental model of COVID-19 transmission in the population of Ontario, Canada. We compared a base case with limited testing, isolation and quarantine to scenarios with the following: enhanced case finding, restrictive physical-distancing measures, or a combination of enhanced case finding and less restrictive physical distancing. Interventions were either implemented for fixed durations or dynamically cycled on and off, based on projected occupancy of intensive care unit (ICU) beds. We present medians and credible intervals from 100 replicates per scenario using a 2-year time horizon. RESULTS: We estimated that 56% (95% credible interval 42%-63%) of the Ontario population would be infected over the course of the epidemic in the base case. At the epidemic peak, we projected 107 000 (95% credible interval 60 760-149 000) cases in hospital (non-ICU) and 55 500 (95% credible interval 32 700-75 200) cases in ICU. For fixed-duration scenarios, all interventions were projected to delay and reduce the height of the epidemic peak relative to the base case, with restrictive physical distancing estimated to have the greatest effect. Longer duration interventions were more effective. Dynamic interventions were projected to reduce the proportion of the population infected at the end of the 2-year period and could reduce the median number of cases in ICU below current estimates of Ontario's ICU capacity. INTERPRETATION: Without substantial physical distancing or a combination of moderate physical distancing with enhanced case finding, we project that ICU resources would be overwhelmed. Dynamic physical distancing could maintain health-system capacity and also allow periodic psychological and economic respite for populations.","Tuite, Ashleigh R; Fisman, David N; Greer, Amy L",CMAJ,,416
340432,Covid-19: Vaccine hesitancy fell after vaccination programme started,2021,"Importance: The pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) presents an unprecedented challenge to identify effective drugs for prevention and treatment. Given the rapid pace of scientific discovery and clinical data generated by the large number of people rapidly infected by SARS-CoV-2, clinicians need accurate evidence regarding effective medical treatments for this infection. Observations: No proven effective therapies for this virus currently exist. The rapidly expanding knowledge regarding SARS-CoV-2 virology provides a significant number of potential drug targets. The most promising therapy is remdesivir. Remdesivir has potent in vitro activity against SARS-CoV-2, but it is not US Food and Drug Administration approved and currently is being tested in ongoing randomized trials. Oseltamivir has not been shown to have efficacy, and corticosteroids are currently not recommended. Current clinical evidence does not support stopping angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers in patients with COVID-19. Conclusions and Relevance: The COVID-19 pandemic represents the greatest global public health crisis of this generation and, potentially, since the pandemic influenza outbreak of 1918. The speed and volume of clinical trials launched to investigate potential therapies for COVID-19 highlight both the need and capability to produce high-quality evidence even in the middle of a pandemic. No therapies have been shown effective to date.","Sanders, James M; Monogue, Marguerite L; Jodlowski, Tomasz Z; Cutrell, James B",JAMA,,416
341722,Operational Impacts of the coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) Pandemic and Early Recovery Trends: University of Washington Anatomic Pathology Experience,2020,"BACKGROUND: The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has caused significant stress and mental health problems among the general public. However, persons at greatest risk for poor mental health outcomes, such as people with serious mental illness, have been largely overlooked. OBJECTIVE: This paper presents the protocol for a study that aims to examine the mental health impact of COVID-19 and social distancing behaviors in people with serious mental illness and the behaviors undertaken to prevent COVID-19 infection in this group. METHODS: Participants will include individuals with serious mental illness (eg, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder) and nonpsychiatric control participants who are currently participating in or have previously participated in several ongoing parent observational studies. Data will be collected from April 2020 through August 2020. Participants will complete phone interviews at 2 time points to assess their current emotional functioning and discuss the measures they have taken to prevent COVID-19 infection. Baseline (pre-COVID-19) mental health, sampled by ecological momentary assessment over an extended period, will be compared with current mental health, also sampled by ecological momentary assessment over an extended period. Demographic, cognitive, and psychosocial factors at baseline will be used to examine risk and resilience to current mental health and coping. RESULTS: The inclusion of participants for the first round of telephone assessments started on April 3, 2020 and will be completed by May 31, 2020. As of April 30, 2020, 101 individuals had completed these first-round assessments. The second round of telephone assessments will likely occur between June 1, 2020, and August 31, 2020. Study results will be published in peer-reviewed scientific journals. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings will have broad implications for understanding the psychological consequences of COVID-19 among vulnerable persons with serious mental illness and will provide the opportunity to identify targets to reduce negative outcomes in the future. We also hope our efforts will provide a roadmap and resources for other researchers who would like to implement a similar approach.

El trabajo ocupa un lugar clave en la vida de la mujer, y a su vez comprende varias dimensiones. Dos de ellas son el trabajo doméstico no remunerado (TDNR) e invisibilizado, y el trabajo productivo remunerado (TPR) fuera dela casa. El objetivo de esta investigación fue comprender cómo es la percepción de salud en la mujer actual de clase media urbana con doble jornada laboral y cómo ella jerarquiza su TPR. Métodos. Investigación con enfoque cualitativo realizada en un hospital privado universitario de la Ciudad de Buenos Aires, mediante entrevistas individuales a mujeres adultas y alfabetas de 30 a 60 años de edad, seleccionadas a través del método de bola de nieve a partir de sus médicos de cabecera. Se utilizaron fichas demográficas estructuradas y entrevistas en profundidad. Se registraron datos personales y prácticas médicas realizadas en los últimos años. Se realizó un análisis de contenido. Resultados. Entrevistamos a 47 mujeres, la mayoría con hijos y la mitad, a cargo de las tareas domésticas en su hogar. Ninguna de ellas reconoció la tarea doméstica (TDNR) como trabajo, 76 % refirió no realizar controles habituales de salud,aunque más del 90 % hizo las prácticas preventivas recomendadas para su edad. Las mujeres entrevistadas expresaron diferentes significados atribuidos por ellas al TPR como independencia, desarrollo personal, mejoría en autoestima, calidad de vida, y sociabilidad. Sin embargo, ante su ausencia en el hogar se mostraron ambivalentes y con sentimientos de culpabilidad. Conclusiones. Este estudio permite reconocer que las mujeres con trabajo TDNR y TPR valoran positivamente a este último, pero se cuestionan que éste les quite tiempo a su participación en el ámbito familiar. Esto resulta en una mayor autoexigencia y perpetúa la invisibilidad del TDNR. En relación al autocuidado, sienten que no realizan sus cuidados médicos, pero tienen buenos indicadores de prácticas preventivas. Quizás sea necesario propiciar la reflexión acerca del rol que tiene el TPR en su bienestar. (AU)","Musarella, Nadia; Disacacciatti, Vilda",Evid. actual. práct. ambul,,416
345657,RILI model and the Covid-19 pneumonia: The radiation oncologist point of view,2020,"The author discusses the laser interference method to measure the size of small bio-particles: extracellular vesicles (EVs), exosomes and viruses of nanometer scale in flow cytometry. By introducing a new laser configuration in place of conventional optical system of the flow cytometry, the interference fringe (periodic intensity modulation) is created inside the flow which provides a calibrated scale for the size measurement. The fringe pitch is precisely determined by the crossing angle of laser beams and the wavelength. The transverse size of the beam spot can be much larger than wavelength, for example, 30 micro-meters, where the flow cell design in conventional system can be used with moderated dimensional tolerance. The interaction length of sample with laser becomes longer: ~30 micro-meter and thus the scattering light and fluorescent light in case of labeled particle becomes much higher. Importantly, those signals are modulated in MHz frequency range associated with the periodic intensity modulation of the interference fringe. By measuring modulation depth, we can determine the particle size. We may utilize a bandpass filter or the digital signal processing of FFT, and thus we can drastically improve S/N ratio. This is because of the narrow spectrum of signal and thus effectively eliminates noise from various debris contained in the sample, and also low frequency shot noise in the photo detector signal. Thanks to the above-mentioned merits, it will be possible to measure the size of EVs and exosomes in particle-by-particle basis in reliable dimensional scale at nano-meter resolution. It will be also possible to realize the fast virus detection system for screening passengers in the airport at the current pandemic of COVID-19 and in future.","Shintake, T.",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2105.11542v1.pdf,416
345773,Multi-system inflammatory syndrome associated with covid-19 in children,2020,"Previously it has been demonstrated that telehealth (TH) could help cover the gaps in health attention in remote locations. Today the expanded capabilities have transformed TH delivery, and from the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic, it has remained one of our biggest allies. Telehealth has become a central piece in patient healthcare delivery during COVID-19 pandemic era. Telehealth allows health care services to reach patients in their homes, keeping other patients safe through social distancing and maintaining self-quarantine. Within this administration of health, TH allows health care providers to focus more resources to pandemic usage and at the same time continue caring for the health of non COVID-19 patients. During this time, clinicians are expanding knowledge about TH capabilities, such as application of forward triage as a tool to avoid patient contact in emergency departments. While previously TH was mainly used for primary care needs, specialized and urgent care health is now being utilized more than ever before. These advantages comes with limitations, some of them include a limited physical exam, lack of access to diagnostic testing or imaging, and many other pitfalls and persistent unmet needs. The 2020 pandemic has led to significant improvements leading into the next generation of telemedicine.","Colbert, Gates B; Venegas-Vera, A Verner; Lerma, Edgar V",Rev Cardiovasc Med,,416

We evaluated the impact of two aerosol boxes (an early-generation box and a latest-generation box) on intubations in patients with severe coronavirus disease 2019 with an in-situ simulation crossover study. The simulated process complied with the Safe Airway Society coronavirus disease 2019 airway management guidelines. The primary outcome was intubation time; secondary outcomes included first-pass success and breaches to personal protective equipment. All intubations were performed by specialist (consultant) anaesthetists and video recorded. Twelve anaesthetists performed 36 intubations. Intubation time with no aerosol box was significantly shorter than with the early-generation box (median (IQR [range]) 42.9 (32.9-46.9 [30.9-57.6])s vs. 82.1 (45.1-98.3 [30.8-180.0])s p = 0.002) and the latest-generation box (52.4 (43.1-70.3 [35.7-169.2])s, p = 0.008). No intubations without a box took more than 1 min, whereas 14 (58%) intubations with a box took over 1 min and 4 (17%) took over 2 min (including one failure). Without an aerosol box, all anaesthetists obtained first-pass success. With the early-generation and latest-generation boxes, 9 (75%) and 10 (83%) participants obtained first-pass success, respectively. One breach of personal protective equipment occurred using the early-generation box and seven breaches occurred using the latest-generation box. Aerosol boxes may increase intubation times and therefore expose patients to the risk of hypoxia. They may cause damage to conventional personal protective equipment and therefore place clinicians at risk of infection. Further research is required before these devices can be considered safe for clinical use.","Begley, J L; Lavery, K E; Nickson, C P; Brewster, D J",Anaesthesia,,416

METHODS: A cross-sectional online survey was distributed to all consultant glaucoma specialists who are on the UK and Eire Glaucoma Society contact list. Participants were asked specific questions regarding preferences in glaucoma surgical practices and whether these had changed subsequent to the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS: Trabeculectomy was the procedure of choice for 61 (87%) glaucoma specialists. A total of 51 (73%) respondents reported performing minimally invasive glaucoma surgery (MIGS) procedures before the COVID-19 pandemic. The most commonly performed MIGS procedure was the iStent inject (51%), followed by XEN 45 (36%) and Preserflo (17%). Forty-three (61%) respondents reported modifying their glaucoma surgery practice subsequent to the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Of the glaucoma specialists who modified their surgical practices, 21 (43%) specifically reduced the number of trabeculectomies performed. In combination, diode laser (both micropulse and conventional trans-scleral cyclodiode) was the most common alternative procedure. Glaucoma drainage devices, deep sclerectomy and Preserflo were also commonly chosen alternatives. CONCLUSION: Although trabeculectomy remains the most commonly performed established glaucoma surgery, it is being performed with reduced frequency during the COVID-19 pandemic due to the number of postoperative visits and procedures required. Alternatives such as conventional and micropulse diode laser, glaucoma drainage devices, deep sclerectomy and Preserflo appear to be the favoured alternative procedures.","Holland, Lee Joseph; Mercieca, Karl J; Kirwan, James F",Br. j. ophthalmol,,416

The evaluation of urban resilience is a hybrid multiple attribute group decision-making problem involving both crisp and fuzzy indicators. In order to evaluate the urban resilience reasonably and quantitatively, an urban resilience evaluation index system is established, including four primary indicators of ecological environment, municipal facilities, economic development and social development, and 28 secondary indicators. An evaluation model based on the theory of intuitionistic fuzzy set and TOPSIS method is proposed. The intuitionistic trapezoidal fuzzy number is used to quantify the fuzzy index and determine the weights of experts. The weight of each index is determined based on the maximizing deviation method. The relevant data of Dalian City from 2013 to 2017 are collected to evaluate the city resilience, and a sensitivity analysis is carried out based on the proposed model. The results may provide insights for the further urban resilience promotion.","Xun, Xiaolin; Yuan, Yongbo",Nat Hazards (Dordr),,416

362160,Are my patients with rheumatic diseases at higher risk of COVID-19?,2020,"PURPOSE: We sought to assess the impact of disruptions due to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) on caregivers of childhood cancer survivors. METHODS: A 13-question survey containing multiple-choice, Likert-type, and free-text questions on experiences, behaviors, and attitudes during the COVID-19 outbreak was sent to childhood cancer caregivers and completed between April 13 and May 17, 2020. Ordered logistic regression was used to investigate relationships between demographics, COVID-related experiences, and caregiver well-being. RESULTS: Caregivers from 321 unique families completed the survey, including 175 with children under active surveillance/follow-up care and 146 with children no longer receiving oncology care. Overall, caregivers expressed exceptional resiliency, highlighting commonalities between caring for a child with cancer and adopting COVID-19 prophylactic measures. However, respondents reported delayed/canceled appointments (50%) and delayed/canceled imaging (19%). Eleven percent of caregivers reported struggling to pay for basic needs, which was associated with greater disruption to daily life, greater feelings of anxiety, poorer sleep, and less access to social support (p < .05). Caregivers who were self-isolating reported greater feelings of anxiety and poorer sleep (p < .05). Respondents who expressed confidence in the government response to COVID-19 reported less disruption to their daily life, decreased feelings of depression and anxiety, better sleep, and greater hopefulness (p < .001) CONCLUSIONS: Caregivers are experiencing changes to medical care, financial disruptions, and emotional distress due to COVID-19. To better serve caregivers and medically at-risk children, clinicians must evaluate financial toxicity and feelings of isolation in families affected by childhood cancer, and work to provide reliable information on how COVID-19 may differentially impact their children.","Wimberly, Courtney E; Towry, Lisa; Caudill, Caroline; Johnston, Emily E; Walsh, Kyle M",Pediatr Blood Cancer,,416

367230,Lipid-lowering therapy and renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors in the era of the COVID-19 pandemic,2020,"SARS-CoV-2 virus infection is responsible for coronavirus disease (COVID-19), which is characterised by a hyperinflammatory response that plays a major role in determining the respiratory and immune-mediated complications of this condition. While isolating peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from whole blood of COVID-19 patients by density gradient centrifugation, we noticed some changes in the floating properties and in the sedimentation of the cells on density medium. Investigating this further, we found that in early phase COVID-19 patients, characterised by reduced circulating lymphocytes and monocytes, the PBMC fraction contained surprisingly high levels of neutrophils. Furthermore, the neutrophil population exhibited alterations in the cell size and in the internal complexity, consistent with the presence of low density neutrophils (LDNs) and immature forms, which may explain the shift seen in the floating abilities and that may be predictive of the severity of the disease. The percentage of this subset of neutrophils found in the PBMC band was rather spread (35.4 ± 27.2%, with a median 28.8% and IQR 11.6-56.1, Welch's t-test early phase COVID-19 versus blood donor healthy controls P < 0.0001). Results confirm the presence of an increased number of LDNs in patients with early stage COVID-19, which correlates with disease severity and may be recovered by centrifugation on a density gradient together with PBMCs.","Manunta, Maria D I; Lamorte, Giuseppe; Ferrari, Francesca; Trombetta, Elena; Tirone, Mario; Bianco, Cristiana; Cattaneo, Alessandra; Santoro, Luigi; Baselli, Guido; Brasca, Manuela; Ostadreza, Mahnoosh; Erba, Elisa; Gori, Andrea; Bandera, Alessandra; Porretti, Laura; Valenti, Luca V C; Prati, Daniele",Sci Rep,,416

Method. - Negative sexual cognitions (NSC), positive sexual emotions (PSE) and negative sexual emotions (NSE) are assessed using a tool inspired by the Sexual Mode Questionnaire. Data are crossed with sociodemographic indicators, information on lockdown modalities, indices on sex life, information on psychological functioning and sexual satisfaction. Main results. - One third of the participants saw a decrease in the frequency of their sexual activities or in their sexual satisfaction. Changes in NSCs were found in 74.4% of subjects (increase: 38.4%;decrease: 36%). Emotional changes are found in between 50.7% (NSC: increase: 20.2%;decrease: 30.5%) and 60.9% (PSE: increase: 24.6%;decrease: 36.3%) of participants. The effect of lockdown on NSC, NSE, and PSE depends on gender at birth, intensity of depressive symptoms, and attachment styles. Women appear to be more vulnerable to lockdown than men. Insecure or depressed subjects also appear more vulnerable. The lockdown impact also depends on changes in the frequency of physical/digital intercourse during lockdown and the modalities of confinement. Changes in NSC, NSE, and PSE had a significant effect on sexual satisfaction during lockdown. Conclusion. - The lockdown impact on sexual emotions and cognitions is non-negligible and greater than the impact on sexual behaviors. Whether it is positive or negative, it asks about the post-confinement repercussions: what becomes of a positive impact with deconfinement? Will the negative impacts be one-off or will vulnerabilities be expressed over the long term? (C) 2021 Sexologies. Published by Elsevier Masson SAS.

374011,Why are COVID-19 fatality rates among medical doctors higher than those among medical nurses?,2021,"Three experiments investigated the role of prosodic structure for infants' recognition of embedded word sequences. Six-month-olds were familiarized with 2 versions of the same sequence, 1 corresponding to a well-formed prosodic unit and the other to a prosodically ill-formed sequence (although a successive word series). Next, infants heard 2 test passages. One included the well-formed unit, and the other included the ill-formed sequence. In Experiment 1, infants listened longer to the passage containing the well-formed unit, suggesting that such units, even when they are embedded, are better recognized. Experiments 2 and 3 showed that this better recognition does not depend on an acoustic match between the familiarized sequences and their later embeddings. This suggests that the advantage of the well-formed unit is at least partially due to infants' use of prosody to parse continuous speech.","Nazzi, Thierry; Kemler Nelson, Deborah G; Jusczyk, Peter W; Jusczyk, Ann Marie",Infancy,,416

Early analyses indicated that baseline quality was not predictive of nursing home cases, but a more nuanced study of the role of nurse staffing is needed to target resources and better respond to future outbreaks. We sought to understand whether baseline nurse staffing is associated with the presence of COVID-19 in nursing homes and whether staffing impacts outbreak severity. DESIGN: We analyzed Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) facility-level data on COVID-19 cases and deaths merged with nursing home and county characteristics. We used logistic regressions to examine the associations of staffing levels from Nursing Home Compare with the outcomes of any COVID-19 cases and, conditional on at least one case, an outbreak. Among facilities with at least one case, we modeled count of deaths using hurdle negative binomial-2 regressions. SETTING: All nursing homes in the CMS COVID-19 Nursing Home Dataset with reports that passed the CMS Quality Assurance Check as of June 25, 2020. PARTICIPANTS: Residents of nursing homes that met COVID-19 reporting requirements. MEASUREMENTS: A nursing home is defined as having at least one case is if one or more confirmed or suspected COVID-19 case among residents or staff is reported. Conditional on at least one case, we examine two outcomes: an outbreak, defined as confirmed cases/certified beds >10% or total confirmed and suspected cases/beds >20% or >10 deaths, and the total number of deaths attributed to COVID-19 among residents and staff. RESULTS: A total of 71% of the 13,167 nursing homes that reported COVID-19 data as of June 14 had at least one case among residents and/or staff. Of those, 27% experienced an outbreak. Higher registered nurse-hours are associated with a higher probability of experiencing any cases. However, among facilities with at least one case, higher nurse aide (NA) hours and total nursing hours are associated with a lower probability of experiencing an outbreak and with fewer deaths. The strongest predictor of cases and outbreaks in nursing homes is per capita cases in the county. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of COVID-19 in the community remains the strongest predictor of COVID-19 cases and deaths in nursing homes, but higher NA hours and total nursing hours may help contain the number of cases and deaths.","Gorges, Rebecca J; Konetzka, R Tamara",J Am Geriatr Soc,,416

Mathematical modeling of epidemics is critical for developing such policies, especially during these uncertain times. In this study, the reproduction number and model parameters were predicted using AR(1) (autoregressive time-series model of order 1) and the adaptive Kalman filter (AKF). The data sample used in the study consists of the weekly and daily number of cases amongst the Ziraat Bank personnel between March 11, 2020, and April 19, 2021. This sample was modeled in the state space, and the AKF was used to estimate the number of cases per day. It is quite simple to model the daily and weekly case number time series with the time-varying parameter AR(1) stochastic process and to estimate the time-varying parameter with online AKF. Overall, we found that the weekly case number prediction was more accurate than the daily case number (R2 = 0.97), especially in regions with a low number of cases. We suggest that the simplest method for reproduction number estimation can be obtained by modeling the daily cases using an AR(1) model.","Met, Iacute; lker, Özbek Levent Aksoy Himmet Erkoç Ayfer",Journal of Statistical and Econometric Methods,,416

380254,Pos-811 Impact of Coronavirus Infection on the Course of Chronic Kidney Disease,2021,"BACKGROUND: The rapid spread of COVID-19 virus from China to other countries and outbreaks of disease require an epidemiological analysis of the disease in the shortest time and an increased awareness of effective interventions. The purpose of this study was to estimate the COVID-19 epidemic in Iran based on the SIR model. The results of the analysis of the epidemiological data of Iran from January 22 to March 24, 2020 were investigated and prediction was made until April 15, 2020. METHODS: By estimating the three parameters of time-dependent transmission rate, time-dependent recovery rate, and timedependent death rate from Covid-19 outbreak in China, and using the number of Covid-19 infections in Iran, we predicted the number of patients for the next month in Iran. Each of these parameters was estimated using GAM models. All analyses were conducted in R software using the mgcv package. RESULTS: Based on our predictions of Iran about 29000 people will be infected from March 25 to April 15, 2020. On average, 1292 people with COVID-19 are expected to be infected daily in Iran. The epidemic peaks within 3 days (March 25 to March 27, 2020) and reaches its highest point on March 25, 2020 with 1715 infected cases. CONCLUSION: The most important point is to emphasize the timing of the epidemic peak, hospital readiness, government measures and public readiness to reduce social contact.","Zareie, Bushra; Roshani, Amin; Mansournia, Mohammad Ali; Rasouli, Mohammad Aziz; Moradi, Ghobad",Arch Iran Med,,416

383882,Homelessness: a ‘cause of the causes’ of cardiovascular disease?,2020,"INTRODUCTION: The aim of the study is to present the current state of knowledge on the influence of vitamin D levels on the severity of the course of COVID-19. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The latest available literature was reviewed until October 30, 2020 from the PubMed database. RESULTS: The literature reports that vitamin D has immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory effects. It reduces the expression of cytokines such as IL-6, TNF-&#945; and INF-Î³, regulates the activity of T helper lymphocytes, and other elements of the immune system at the molecular level. The deficiency of this vitamin promotes the activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, contributing to the development of acute respiratory distress syndrome. The severity of the course of SARS-CoV-2 infection depends on comorbidities, the development and course of which may also be affected by vitamin D levels (coagulopathies, pulmonary, cardiological, metabolic diseases). Most of the analyzed research studies from different countries indicated a relationship between insufficient vitamin D levels and a more severe course of COVID-19 and an increase in mortality due to it, especially among the elderly. Researchers agree that further analyzes are necessary concerning both the influence of the vitamin D blood serum levels on the morbidity and mortality due to COVID-19 as well as the use of its supplementation in the struggle against SARS-CoV-2 virus. There are reports of possible beneficial interactions of vitamin D with other substances, such as quercetin, estradiol, some microelements, and other vitamins. CONCLUSIONS: Maintaining an adequate level of vitamin D has a positive effect on the functioning of the immune system. At the moment, there is insufficient evidence to establish a clear relationship between vitamin D levels and the severity of COVID-19. It is necessary to conduct further research on a larger study group. The literature does not mention the use of vitamin D as a medication for COVID-19. People at risk of vitamin D deficiency should consider vitamin D supplementation at the current time of the pandemic.","Reka, Gabriela; Korzeniowska, Anna; Machowiec, Piotr; Maksymowicz, Marcela; Piecewicz-Szczesna, Halina",Przegl Epidemiol,,416

387387,Meralgia Paraesthetica after Prone Position Ventilation in a Patient with COVID-19,2020,"Within the past several decades, the emergence of new viral diseases with severe health complications and mortality is evidence of an age-dependent, compromised bodily response to abrupt stress with concomitantly reduced immunity. The new severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, SARS-CoV-2, causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). It has increased morbidity and mortality in persons with underlying chronic diseases and those with a compromised immune system regardless of age and in older adults who are more likely to have these conditions. While SARS-CoV-2 is highly virulent, there is variability in the severity of the disease and its complications in humans. Severe pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, lung fibrosis, cardiovascular events, acute kidney injury, stroke, hospitalization, and mortality have been reported that result from pathogen-host interactions. Hallmarks of aging, interacting with one another, have been proposed to influence health span in older adults, possibly via mechanisms regulating the immune system. Here, we review the potential roles of the hallmarks of aging, coupled with host-coronavirus interactions. Of these hallmarks, we focused on those that directly or indirectly interact with viral infections, including immunosenescence, inflammation and inflammasomes, adaptive immunosenescence, genomic instability, mitochondrial dysfunction, epigenetic alterations, telomere attrition, and impaired autophagy. These hallmarks likely contribute to the increased pathophysiological responses to SARS-CoV-2 among older adults and may play roles as an additive risk of accelerated biological aging even after recovery. We also briefly discuss the role of antiaging drug candidates that require paramount attention in COVID-19 research.","Salimi, Shabnam; Hamlyn, John M",J Gerontol A Biol Sci Med Sci,,416
387925,SARS-CoV-2 Transmission and the Risk of Aerosol-Generating Procedures,2020,"INTRODUCTION: Both fatty liver disease (FLD) and alcohol consumption have been reported to affect incident type 2 diabetes mellitus. The aim of this study was to evaluate the combined effect of FLD and alcohol consumption on incident type 2 diabetes. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: In this historical cohort study involving 9948 men, we investigated the influence of the presence of FLD and the grades of alcohol consumption on incident type 2 diabetes using Cox proportional hazards models. We categorized the participants into the following four groups: none or minimal alcohol consumption, <40 g/week; light, 40-140 g/week; moderate, 140-280 g/week; or heavy alcohol consumption, >280 g/week. FLD was diagnosed by abdominal ultrasonography. RESULTS: During the median 6.0-year follow-up, 568 participants developed type 2 diabetes. Heavy alcohol consumers with FLD showed a higher risk for developing type 2 diabetes compared with the other groups. Moderate alcohol consumers without FLD had a significantly higher risk for developing incident type 2 diabetes, compared with none or minimal and light alcohol consumers without FLD. In contrast, there was no apparent difference in the risk for incident type 2 diabetes between none or minimal, light, and moderate alcohol consumers with FLD. Furthermore, there was no statistically significant difference in the risk for incident type 2 diabetes between a moderate and heavy alcohol consumer without FLD and a none or minimal, light, and moderate alcohol consumer with FLD. CONCLUSIONS: To prevent incident type 2 diabetes, we should acknowledge that the impact of alcohol consumption may vary in the presence of FLD.","Okamura, Takuro; Hashimoto, Yoshitaka; Hamaguchi, Masahide; Obora, Akihiro; Kojima, Takao; Fukui, Michiaki",,,416

390236,An overview of mobile applications (apps) to support the coronavirus disease 2019 response in India,2020,"BACKGROUND: The new evere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is characterized by its high capacity to transmit. Health-care personnel is highly susceptible to becoming infected. This study aimed to determine the characteristics and known risk factors for contagion and severe outcomes of SARS-CoV-2 disease in health-care personnel of a pediatric coronavirus disease (COVID) center in Mexico City. METHODS: In the last week of March 2020 (at the beginning of phase 2 of the Ministry of Health's national campaign in Mexico), a study was conducted on healthcare workers of a pediatric COVID hospital in Mexico City. Using a virtual interview, we evaluated comorbidities, mobility, areas and functions where they carry out the activities, protection measures, contact history, and vaccination. According to their activities, healthcare workers were classified into the following areas: medical, nursing, other health-care personnel (researchers, nutritionists, rehabilitation, imaging, and laboratory), administrative, and other services. We compared the variables between the groups of healthcare workers with the X2 test. RESULTS: We included 812 participants. The mean age was 41 ± 11 years, and 33% were overweight or obese, 18% were over 60 years old, and 19% had high blood pressure. Medical and nursing personnel presented a higher proportion in the use of standard protection measures. CONCLUSIONS: Among healthcare workers, there are risk conditions for the development of complications in case of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Most medical and nursing personnel use standard protective measures.","Márquez-González, Horacio; Klünder-Klünder, Miguel; de la Rosa-Zamboni, Daniela; Ortega-Riosvelasco, Fernando; López-Martínez, Briceida; Jean-Tron, Guadalupe; Chapa-Koloffon, Gina; Ávila-Hernández, A Viridiana; Garduño-Espinosa, Juan; Villa-Guillén, Mónica; Nieto-Zermeño, Jaime",Bol Med Hosp Infant Mex,,416
391351,Pulmonary aspergillosis in critically ill patients with COVID-19: A case series,2020,"Abugida refers to a phonogram writing system where each syllable is represented using a single consonant or typographic ligature, along with a default vowel or optional diacritic(s) to denote other vowels. However, texting in these languages has some unique challenges in spite of the advent of devices with soft keyboard supporting custom key layouts. The number of characters in these languages is large enough to require characters to be spread over multiple views in the layout. Having to switch between views many times to type a single word hinders the natural thought process. This prevents popular usage of native keyboard layouts. On the other hand, supporting romanized scripts (native words transcribed using Latin characters) with language model based suggestions is also set back by the lack of uniform romanization rules. To this end, we propose a disambiguation algorithm and showcase its usefulness in two novel mutually non-exclusive input methods for languages natively using the abugida writing system: (a) disambiguation of ambiguous input for abugida scripts, and (b) disambiguation of word variants in romanized scripts. We benchmark these approaches using public datasets, and show an improvement in typing speed by 19.49%, 25.13%, and 14.89%, in Hindi, Bengali, and Thai, respectively, using Ambiguous Input, owing to the human ease of locating keys combined with the efficiency of our inference method. Our Word Variant Disambiguation (WDA) maps valid variants of romanized words, previously treated as Out-of-Vocab, to a vocabulary of 100k words with high accuracy, leading to an increase in Error Correction F1 score by 10.03% and Next Word Prediction (NWP) by 62.50% on average.","Ghosh, Sourav; Gothe, Sourabh Vasant; Sanchi, Chandramouli; Raja, Barath Raj Kandur",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.03916v1.pdf,416

393723,Can transmembrane protease serine 2 be attributed to coronavirus disease-2019 related acute kidney injury predominance in males?,2020,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has evolved into one of the most impactful health crises in modern history, compelling researchers to explore innovative ways to efficiently collect public health data in a timely manner. Social media platforms have been explored as a research recruitment tool in other settings; however, their feasibility for collecting representative survey data during infectious disease epidemics remain unexplored. OBJECTIVES: This study has two aims 1) describe the methodology used to recruit a nationwide sample of adults residing in the United States (U.S.) to participate in a survey on COVID-19 knowledge, beliefs, and practices, and 2) outline the preliminary findings related to recruitment, challenges using social media as a recruitment platform, and strategies used to address these challenges. METHODS: An original web-based survey informed by evidence from past literature and validated scales was developed. A Facebook advertisement campaign was used to disseminate the link to an online Qualtrics survey between March 20-30, 2020. Two supplementary male-only and racial minority- targeted advertisements were created on the sixth and tenth day of recruitment, respectively, to address issues of disproportionate female- and White-oriented gender- and ethnic-skewing observed in the advertisement's reach and response trends. RESULTS: In total, 6602 participant responses were recorded with representation from all U.S. 50 states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico. The advertisements cumulatively reached 236,017 individuals and resulted in 9609 clicks (4.07% reach). Total cost of the advertisement was $906, resulting in costs of $0.09 per click and $0.18 per full response (completed surveys). Implementation of the male-only advertisement improved the cumulative percentage of male respondents from approximately 20 to 40%. CONCLUSIONS: The social media advertisement campaign was an effective and efficient strategy to collect large scale, nationwide data on COVID-19 within a short time period. Although the proportion of men who completed the survey was lower than those who didn't, interventions to increase male responses and enhance representativeness were successful. These findings can inform future research on the use of social media recruitment for the rapid collection of survey data related to rapidly evolving health crises, such as COVID-19.","Ali, Shahmir H; Foreman, Joshua; Capasso, Ariadna; Jones, Abbey M; Tozan, Yesim; DiClemente, Ralph J",BMC Med Res Methodol,,416

A rapid expansion in cases affecting most countries around the globe led to major changes in the way people live their daily lives. In the United Kingdom, the Department of Health and Social Care directed healthcare providers to establish additional resources to manage the anticipated surge in cases that could overwhelm the health services. A priority area was testing for SARS-CoV-2 RNA and its detection by qualitative RT-PCR. DESIGN: A laboratory workflow twinning research environment with clinical laboratory capabilities was implemented and validated in the University of Birmingham within 4 days of the project initiation. The diagnostic capability was centred on an IVD CE-marked RT-PCR kit and designed to provide surge capacity to the nearby Queen Elizabeth Hospital. The service was initially tasked with testing healthcare workers (HCW) using throat swabs, and subsequently the process investigated the utility of using saliva as an alternative sample type. RESULTS: Between the 8th April 2020 and the 30th April 2020, the laboratory tested a total of 1282 HCW for SARS-CoV-2 RNA in throat swabs. RNA was detected in 54 % of those who reported symptoms compatible with COVID-19, but in only 4% who were asymptomatic.

This situation demands a productive solution for face mask (FM) waste management to solve several associated environmental issues. In the current study, a novel soil treatment method is proposed for the improvement of mechanical characteristics of fat clay by using FM as fiber reinforcement and silica fume (SF) as the cementitious agent in the form of a composite binary admixture (CBA). The performance of the proposed CBA is compared with SF and FM as the lone stabilizers by conducting extensive geotechnical testing. The SF treatment exponentially improves the strength characteristics of soil but it marginalizes the ductility of soil, inviting sudden failure and instability under dynamic loadings. It is observed that the proposed CBA not only improves the strength characteristics more than SF but also regulates the ductility and deformability of treated soil due to the presence of FM fibers. In addition, the policies and protocols on the logistics of collecting FM waste and making it ready for the proposed geotechnical application are reviewed; associated health risks, socioeconomic conditions and available technologies are the major governing factors to formulate and implement these policies.

397903,The Limits to Learning an SIR Process: Granular Forecasting for Covid-19,2020-06-11,"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) global pandemic has strikingly high mortality rate with hypercoagulability state being part of the imputed mechanisms. We aimed to compare the rates of in hospital mortality in propensity score matched cohorts of COVID-19 patients in chronic anticoagulation versus those that were not. METHODS: In this population-based study in the Veneto Region, we retrospectively reviewed all patients aged 65 years or older, with a laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis. We compared, after propensity score matching, those who received chronic anticoagulation for atrial fibrillation with those who did not. RESULTS: Overall, 4697 COVID-19 patients fulfilled inclusion criteria, and the propensity score matching yielded 559 patients per arm. All-cause mortality rate ratio was significantly higher among non-anticoagulated patients (32.2% vs 26.5%, p = 0.036). On time to event analysis, all-cause mortality was found lower among anticoagulated patients, although the estimate was not statistically significant. (HR 0.81, 95%CI 0.65-1.01, p = 0.054). CONCLUSION: Among elderly patients with COVID-19, those on chronic oral anticoagulant treatment for atrial fibrillation seem to be at lower risk of all-cause mortality compared to their propensity score matched non-anticoagulated counterpart. This finding needs to be confirmed in further studies.","Denas, Gentian; Gennaro, Nicola; Ferroni, Eliana; Fedeli, Ugo; Lorenzoni, Giulia; Gregori, Dario; Iliceto, Sabino; Pengo, Vittorio",Int. j. cardiol,,416

398680,Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome in Patients with Coronavirus Disease 2019: Two Cases and A Review of The Literature,2020,"Background: It has been suggested that sarcoidosis patients, especially those on immunosuppressive medications, are at increased risk for COVID-19 infection and more severe disease. Methods: A questionnaire was developed in four languages (English, Dutch, Italian, and Spanish). The questionnaire queried whether patients had been infected with COVID-19 and outcome of the infection. Risk factors for COVID-19 infection were collected. Results: A total of 5200 sarcoidosis patients completed the questionnaire with 116 (2.23%) reporting infection and 18 (15.8%) required hospitalization. Increased hazard ratio (HR) for COVID-19 infection were seen for those with a COVID-19 infected roommate (HR=27.44, p<0.0001), health care provider (HR=2.4, p=0.0001), pulmonary sarcoidosis (HR=2.48, p=0.001), neurosarcoidosis (HR=2.02, p<0.01), or rituximab treatment (HR=5.40, p<0.0001). A higher rate of hospitalization was found for those with underlying heart disease (HR=3.19 (1.297-7.855), p<0.02). No other feature including race, other immunosuppressive agent, age, or underlying condition was associated with a significant increased risk for infection or more severe disease. Conclusion: The overall rate of COVID-19 was 2.23%, suggesting an increased rate of COVID-19 infection. However, when an analysis of the questionnaires of sarcoidosis and non-sarcoidosis patients was performed in one localized area over this time period, the rate of COVID-19 infection was similar in both groups. Sarcoidosis patients who cohabitated with COVID-19 infected individuals, worked in health care, had pulmonary or neurologic sarcoidosis, or were treated with rituximab had an increased risk for COVID-19 infection. No significant increased risk for hospitalization could be identified based on age, race, gender or any specific immunosuppressive treatment.

399414,Novel Coronavirus Disease 2019 and Subarachnoid Hemorrhage: A Case Report,2020,"Any new pandemic has the potential to arouse considerable anxiety, with this anxiety associated in previous work with economic disruption and societal disruption. We examined anxiety, symptom awareness, trust and associated behavioural responses in the first three weeks of the SARS-CoV-2 (covid-19) outbreak in Thailand. We collected data on-street at randomly selected locations in Bangkok. Of 274 potential respondents, 203 (74.7%) responded. A four-item measure assessed anxiety, with open-ended questions assessing knowledge of symptoms, trusted information sources and measures taken to avoid infection. Respondents reported good awareness of the prime symptoms of the Coronovirus. Binary logistic regressions controlling for sex and age found the more anxious avoided the Chinese, people who were coughing, crowded places and public transport or flying. Younger respondents reported greater trust in foreign media and older populations information from national government. Trust in doctors online was positively associated with avoidance of coughing people and keeping fit; trust in national government with avoiding coughing people, keeping fit, and avoiding public transport . We conclude that anxiety can motivate both desirable and undesirable behaviours during pandemic outbreaks. Effective and targeted communication by trusted sources is needed to motivate preventive actions but also to limit unnecessary or disruptive behaviours.","Goodwin, Robin; Wiwattanapantuwong, Juthatip; Tuicomepee, Arunya; Suttiwan, Panrapee; Watakakosol, Rewadee",J Psychiatr Res,,416

400405,Rectal Cancer Care: Does One Size Fit All?,2021,"BACKGROUND: As young adults living with perinatal HIV (PHIV) or perinatal HIV exposure but uninfected (PHEU) age and manage challenges and competing demands of young adulthood, there is a need for new approaches to facilitate retention in longitudinal research and clinical care beyond in-person clinic visits. Sars-CoV-2, the novel coronavirus that causes COVID-19 disease, emerged in the United States in January 2020 and has underscored this need, as studies adapt to remote communication with and data collection from participants. However, there are limited data on communication preferences among young adults living with PHIV or PHEU. OBJECTIVE: The objectives of this qualitative study were to: 1) describe participants' perceptions and use of social media and technology communication in their personal lives and in the context of participating in longitudinal pediatric HIV research, and 2) describe implications for the use of technology and social media for communication and retention purposes within a longitudinal pediatric study about HIV. METHODS: We conducted 6 focus group discussions with 31 young adults living with PHEU and 13 in-depth interviews with 6 young adults living with PHIV and 7 living with PHEU. We asked about their preferences for the use of social media and digital technology in the Adolescent Master Protocol Up Protocol, a U.S.-based longitudinal cohort study of youth affected by HIV. RESULTS: Participants' willingness to use social media platforms, phone, texting, and video calls within the context of HIV research varied due to fears of HIV stigma and inadvertent disclosure. However, trusting relationships with clinical staff positively impacted their willingness to use these platforms. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings offer insight into how pediatric studies and clinics can communicate with participants as they age, even as new technologies and social media platforms emerge and replace old ones. Pediatric clinical staff should consider communication approaches offering flexible and tailored options for young adults participating in HIV research for optimal retention.","Berman, Claire Amanda; Kacanek, Deborah; Nichamin, Mindy; Wilson, Dominique; Davtyan, Mariam; Salomon, Liz; Patel, Kunjal; Reznick, Megan; Tassiopoulos, Katherine; Lee, Sonia; Bauermeister, Jose; Paul, Mary; Aldape, Theresa; Seage Iii, George",,,416

406000,Cases of coronavirus disease-2019 in HIV-infected transgender women,2020,"Pharmacogenomics, nutrigenomics, vaccinomics, and the nascent field of plant omics are examples of variability science. They are embedded within an overarching framework of personalized medicine. Across these public health specialties, the significance and biology of the placebo response have been historically neglected. A placebo is any substance such as a sugar pill administered in the guise of medication, but one that does not have pharmacological activity. Placebos do have clinical effects, however, that can be substantive in magnitude and vary markedly from person-to-person depending, for example, on the type of disease, symptoms, or clinical trial design. Research over the past several decades attests to a genuine neurobiological basis for placebo effects. All drugs have placebo components that contribute to their overall treatment effect. Placebos are used in clinical trials as control groups to ascertain the net pharmacological effect of a drug candidate. Not only less well known but also relevant to rational therapeutics and personalized medicine is the nocebo. A nocebo effect occurs when an inert substance is administered in a context that induces negative expectations, worsening patients' symptoms. With the COVID-19 pandemic, there are high public expectations for new vaccines and medicines to end the contagion, while at the same time antiscience, post-truth, and antivaccine movements are worrisomely on the rise. These social movements, changes in public health cultures, and conditioned behavioral responses can trigger both placebo and nocebo effects. Hence, in clinical trials, forecasting and explaining placebo and nocebo variability are more important than ever for robust science and personalized health care. Against this overarching context, this article provides (1) a brief history of placebo and (2) a discussion on biology, mechanisms, and variability of placebo effects, and (3) discusses three emerging new concepts: placebogenomics, nocebogenomics, and augmented placebo, that is, the notion of a ""placebo dose."" We conclude with a roadmap for placebogenomics, its synergies with the nascent field of social pharmacology, and the ways in which a new taxonomy of drug and placebo variability can be anticipated in the next decade.","Özdemir, Vural; Endrenyi, Laszlo",Omics,,416
406538,Benefit to Few Versus Risk to Many: An Ethical Dilemma During Coronavirus Disease 2019 Pandemic for Deceased-Donor Organ Transplant in a Resource-Limited Developing Country,2020,"Drawing on Kingdon's Multiple Streams Framework as a heuristic, this article reviews the three streams - problems, policies, and politics - as applied to the adoption of economic policies in response to the socioeconomic impacts of COVID-19. In doing so, we argue that we are currently presented with a window of opportunity to better address the social determinants of health. First, through assessing the problem stream, an understanding of inequity as a problem gained wider recognition through the disproportionate impacts of COVID-19. Second, in the policy stream, we demonstrate that appropriate and unprecedented policies can be enacted even in the face of changing evidence or evidentiary uncertainty, which are needed to address upstream factors that influence health. Lastly, in the politics stream, we demonstrate that addressing a public health 'problem' can be well-received by the public, making it politically viable. However, it is important to ensure the 'problem' is clearly relayed to the public and that this information is not perceived to change, as this can undermine trust. The social, political, and behavioural lessons presented by the COVID-19 pandemic should be drawn on in this pivotal moment for global public health.","Amri, Michelle M; Logan, Dilani",Glob Public Health,,416

As part of this, utilising biomarkers to risk stratify patients has become increasingly popular. During the COVID-19 pandemic the use of D-dimer has increased due to the evidence of COVID-19 induced thrombo-embolic disease. We evaluated the use of D-dimer on all hospital admissions during the peak of the pandemic and evaluated its sensitivity in diagnosing pulmonary embolic disease (PE). Patients without COVID-19 infection were as likely to have evidence of PE as their COVID-positive counterparts. However, the sensitivity of a D-dimer was higher in COVID-positive patients at a lower D-dimer level (>1,500 µg/L, sensitivity 81%, specificity 70%) than in those without clinical, immunological or radiological evidence of COVID-19 infection (D-dimer >2,000 µg/L, sensitivity 80%, specificity 76%).

407024,A case report of a large intracardiac thrombus in a COVID-19 patient managed with percutaneous thrombectomy and right ventricular mechanical circulatory support,2020,"AIMS: Cardiovascular disease has been recognized as a major determinant of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vulnerability and severity. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) 2 is a functional receptor for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and is up-regulated in patients with heart failure. We sought to examine the potential association between reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and the susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection. METHODS AND RESULTS: Of the 1162 patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) who underwent percutaneous coronary intervention between February 2014 and October 2018, we enrolled 889 patients with available clinical follow-up data. Follow-up was conducted by telephone interviews 1 month after the start of the French lockdown which began on 17 March 2020. Patients were divided into two groups according to LVEF 60;40% (reduced LVEF) (n = 91) or &#8805;40% (moderately reduced + preserved LVEF) (n = 798). The incidence of COVID-19-related hospitalization or death was significantly higher in the reduced LVEF group as compared with the moderately reduced + preserved LVEF group (9% vs. 1%, P 60; 0.001). No association was found between discontinuation of ACE-inhibitor or angiotensin-receptor blockers and COVID-19 test positivity. By multivariate logistic regression analysis, reduced LVEF was an independent predictor of COVID-19 hospitalization or death (odds ratio: 6.91, 95% confidence interval: 2.60 to 18.35, P 60; 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: In a large cohort of patients with previous ACS, reduced LVEF was associated with increased susceptibility to COVID-19.

408896,A Postmortem Portrait of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Pandemic: A Large Multi-institutional Autopsy Survey Study,2021,"As a means to counter the SARS-CoV­2 pandemic, schools were closed throughout Germany between mid-March and end of April 2020. Schooling was translocated to the students' homes where students were supposed to work on learning tasks provided by their teachers. Students' self-regulation and attributes of the learning tasks may be assumed to have played important roles when adapting to this novel schooling situation. They may be predicted to have influenced students' daily self-regulation and hence the independence with which they worked on learning tasks. The present work investigated the role of students' trait self-regulation as well as task difficulty and task enjoyment for students' daily independence from their parents in learning during the homeschooling period. Data on children's trait self-regulation were obtained through a baseline questionnaire filled in by the parents of 535 children (M age â¯= 9.69, SD age â¯= 2.80). Parents additionally reported about the daily task difficulty, task enjoyment, and students' learning independence through 21 consecutive daily online questionnaires. The results showed students' trait self-regulation to be positively associated with their daily learning independence. Additionally, students' daily learning independence was shown to be negatively associated with task difficulty and positively with task enjoyment. The findings are discussed with regard to students' daily self-regulation during the homeschooling period. Finally, implications for teaching practice during the pandemic-related school closures are derived.","Blume, Friederike; Schmidt, Andrea; Kramer, Andrea C; Schmiedek, Florian; Neubauer, Andreas B",Z Erziehwiss,,416

Generalized curves of lung opacity volume and density over time can be used as standardized references from well before symptoms develop to over a month after recovery, when residual lung opacities remain. 739 patients with COVID-19 underwent CT and RT-PCR in an outbreak setting between January 21st and April 12th, 2020. 29 of 739 patients had serial exams (121 CTs and 279 laboratory measurements) over 50 ± 16 days, with an average of 4.2 sequential CTs each. Sequential volumes of total lung, overall opacity and opacity subtypes (ground glass opacity [GGO] and consolidation) were extracted using deep learning and manual segmentation. Generalized temporal curves of CT and laboratory measurements were correlated. Lung opacities appeared 3.4 ± 2.2 days prior to symptom onset. Opacity peaked 1 day after symptom onset. GGO onset was earlier and resolved later than consolidation. Lactate dehydrogenase, and C-reactive protein peaked earlier than procalcitonin and leukopenia. The temporal relationships of quantitative CT features and clinical labs have distinctive patterns and peaks in relation to symptom onset, which may inform early clinical course in patients with mild COVID-19 pneumonia, or may shed light upon chronic lung effects or mechanisms of medical countermeasures in clinical trials.","Kassin, Michael T; Varble, Nicole; Blain, Maxime; Xu, Sheng; Turkbey, Evrim B; Harmon, Stephanie; Yang, Dong; Xu, Ziyue; Roth, Holger; Xu, Daguang; Flores, Mona; Amalou, Amel; Sun, Kaiyun; Kadri, Sameer; Patella, Francesca; Cariati, Maurizio; Scarabelli, Alice; Stellato, Elvira; Ierardi, Anna Maria; Carrafiello, Gianpaolo; An, Peng; Turkbey, Baris; Wood, Bradford J",Sci Rep,,416

Identifying the metabolic pathways that are altered early with viral infection and their association with disease severity is crucial to understand COVID-19 pathophysiology, and guide clinical decisions. This study aimed at assessing the critical metabolic pathways altered with disease severity in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Forty-nine hospitalized patients with COVID-19 pneumonia were enrolled in a prospective, observational, single-center study in Barcelona, Spain. Demographic, clinical, and analytical data at admission were registered. Plasma samples were collected within the first 48 h following hospitalization. Patients were stratified based on the severity of their evolution as moderate (N = 13), severe (N = 10), or critical (N = 26). A panel of 221 biomarkers was measured by targeted metabolomics in order to evaluate metabolic changes associated with subsequent disease severity. Our results show that obesity, respiratory rate, blood pressure, and oxygen saturation, as well as some analytical parameters and radiological findings, were all associated with disease severity. Additionally, ceramide metabolism, tryptophan degradation, and reductions in several metabolic reactions involving nicotinamide adenine nucleotide (NAD) at inclusion were significantly associated with respiratory severity and correlated with inflammation. In summary, assessment of the metabolomic profile of COVID-19 patients could assist in disease severity stratification and even in guiding clinical decisions.","Marín-Corral, Judith; Rodríguez-Morató, Jose; Gomez-Gomez, Alex; Pascual-Guardia, Sergi; Muñoz-Bermúdez, Rosana; Salazar-Degracia, Anna; Pérez-Terán, Purificación; Restrepo, Marcos I; Khymenets, Olha; Haro, Noemí; Masclans, Joan Ramon; Pozo, Oscar J",Int. j. mol. sci.

Methods: A cross-sectional study was performed by distributing a multidimensional survey to spine surgeons worldwide. Questions addressed demographics, impacts and perceptions of COVID-19, and the presence of surgeon comorbidities, which included cancer, cardiac disease, diabetes, obesity, hypertension, respiratory illness, renal disease, and current tobacco use. Multivariate analysis was performed to identify specific comorbidities that influenced various impact measures. Results: Across 7 global regions, 36.8% out of 902 respondents reported a comorbidity, of which hypertension (21.9%) and obesity (15.6%) were the most common. Multivariate analysis noted tobacco users were more likely to continue performing elective surgery during the pandemic (odds ratio [OR], 2.62; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.46–4.72; p = 0.001) and were less likely to utilize telecommunication (OR, 0.51; 95% CI, 0.31–0.86; p = 0.011), whereas those with hypertension were less likely to warn their patients should the surgeon become infected with COVID-19 (OR, 0.57; 95% CI, 0.37–0.91; p = 0.017). Clinicians with multiple comorbidities were more likely to cite personal health as a current stressor (OR, 1.32; 95% CI, 1.07–1.63; p = 0.009) and perceived their hospital’s management un-favorably (OR, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.60–0.91; p = 0.005). Conclusion: This is the first study to have mapped global variations of personal health of spine surgeons, key in the development for future wellness and patient management initia-tives.

The lockdown had serious implications on mental health, resulting in psychological problems including frustration, stress, and depression. In order to explore the impacts of this pandemic on the lifestyle of students, we conducted a survey of a total of 1182 individuals of different age groups from various educational institutes in Delhi - National Capital Region (NCR), India. The article identified the following as the impact of COVID -19 on the students of different age groups: time spent on online classes and self-study, medium used for learning, sleeping habits, daily fitness routine, and the subsequent effects on weight, social life, and mental health. Moreover, our research found that in order to deal with stress and anxiety, participants adopted different coping mechanisms and also sought help from their near ones. Further, the research examined the student's engagement on social media platforms among different age categories. This study suggests that public authorities should take all the necessary measures to enhance the learning experience by mitigating the negative impacts caused due to the COVID -19 outbreak.","Chaturvedi, Kunal; Kumar Vishwakarma, Dinesh",Child Youth Serv Rev,,416

We describe key features and early learnings of these programs in the hospital setting. METHODS: Relevant clinical and operational leadership from an academic medical center, pediatric teaching hospital, and safety net county health system met to share learnings shortly after deploying inpatient telemedicine. A summative analysis of their learnings was re-circulated for approval. RESULTS: All three institutions faced pressure to urgently standup new telemedicine systems while still maintaining secure information exchange. Differences across patient demographics and technological capabilities led to variation in solution design, though key technical considerations were similar. Rapid deployment in each system relied on readily available consumer-grade technology, given the existing familiarity to patients and clinicians and minimal infrastructure investment. Preliminary data from the academic medical center over one month suggested positive adoption with 631 inpatient video calls lasting an average (standard deviation) of 16.5 minutes (19.6) based on inclusion criteria. DISCUSSION: The threat of an imminent surge of COVID-19 patients drove three institutions to rapidly develop inpatient telemedicine solutions. Concurrently, federal and state regulators temporarily relaxed restrictions that would have previously limited these efforts. Strategic direction from executive leadership, leveraging off-the-shelf hardware, vendor engagement, and clinical workflow integration facilitated rapid deployment. CONCLUSION: The rapid deployment of inpatient telemedicine is feasible across diverse settings as a response to the COVID-19 pandemic.","Vilendrer, Stacie; Patel, Birju; Chadwick, Whitney; Hwa, Michael; Asch, Steven; Pageler, Natalie; Ramdeo, Rajiv; Saliba-Gustafsson, Erika A; Strong, Philip; Sharp, Christopher",J Am Med Inform Assoc,,416

The SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) pandemic has led to a surge in critical care capacity and prone positioning practices which may increase the risk of ocular complications. This article aims to review all ocular complications associated with prone positioning, with a focus on challenges posed by COVID-19. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A literature review using keywords of ""intensive care"", ""critical care"", ""eye care"", ""ocular disorders"", ""ophthalmic complications,"" ""coronavirus"", ""COVID-19,"" ""prone"" and ""proning"" was performed using the electronic databases of PUBMED, EMBASE and CINAHL. RESULTS: The effects of prone positioning on improving respiratory outcomes in critically unwell patients are well established; however, there is a lack of literature regarding the effects of prone positioning on ocular complications in the critical care setting. Sight-threatening ophthalmic disorders potentiated by proning include ocular surface disease, acute angle closure, ischemic optic neuropathy, orbital compartment syndrome and vascular occlusions. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 patients may be more susceptible to ocular complications with increased proning practices and increasing demand on critical care staff.

429460,Massive pulmonary embolism masked as an episode of acute agitation in a psychiatric patient: A case report,2021,"There is no vaccine or specific antiviral treatment for COVID-19, which is causing a global pandemic. One current focus is drug repurposing research, but those drugs have limited therapeutic efficacies and known adverse effects. The pathology of COVID-19 is essentially unknown. Without this understanding, it is challenging to discover a successful treatment to be approved for clinical use. This paper addresses several key biological processes of reactive oxygen, halogen and nitrogen species (ROS, RHS and RNS) that play crucial physiological roles in organisms from plants to humans. These include why superoxide dismutases, the enzymes to catalyze the formation of H2O2, are required for protecting ROS-induced injury in cell metabolism, why the amount of ROS/RNS produced by ionizing radiation at clinically relevant doses is ~1000 fold lower than the endogenous ROS/RNS level routinely produced in the cell and why a low level of endogenous RHS plays a crucial role in phagocytosis for immune defense. Herein we propose a plausible amplification mechanism in immune defense: ozone-depleting-like halogen cyclic reactions enhancing RHS effects are responsible for all the mentioned physiological functions, which are activated by H2O2 and deactivated by NO signaling molecule. Our results show that the reaction cycles can be repeated thousands of times and amplify the RHS pathogen-killing (defense) effects by 100,000 fold in phagocytosis, resembling the cyclic ozone-depleting reactions in the stratosphere. It is unraveled that H2O2 is a required protective signaling molecule (angel) in the defense system for human health and its dysfunction can cause many diseases or conditions such as autoimmune disorders, aging and cancer. We also identify a class of potent drugs for effective treatment of invading pathogens such as HIV and SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19), cancer and other diseases, and provide a molecular mechanism of action of the drugs or candidates.","Lu, Qing-Bin",,,416

However, no studies were conducted to explore the existence of the micro-structural changes in the central nervous system after infection. We aimed to identify the existence of potential brain micro-structural changes related to SARS-CoV-2. Methods: In this prospective study, diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and 3D high-resolution T1WI sequences were acquired in 60 recovered COVID-19 patients (56.67% male; age: 44.10 ± 16.00) and 39 age- and sex-matched non-COVID-19 controls (56.41% male; age: 45.88 ± 13.90). Registered fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity (MD), axial diffusivity (AD), and radial diffusivity (RD) were quantified for DTI, and an index score system was introduced. Regional volumes derived from Voxel-based Morphometry (VBM) and DTI metrics were compared using analysis of covariance (ANCOVA). Two sample t-test and Spearman correlation were conducted to assess the relationships among imaging indices, index scores and clinical information. Findings: In this follow-up stage, neurological symptoms were presented in 55% COVID-19 patients. COVID-19 patients had statistically significantly higher bilateral gray matter volumes (GMV) in olfactory cortices, hippocampi, insulas, left Rolandic operculum, left Heschl's gyrus and right cingulate gyrus and a general decline of MD, AD, RD accompanied with an increase of FA in white matter, especially AD in the right CR, EC and SFF, and MD in SFF compared with non-COVID-19 volunteers (corrected p value <0.05). Global GMV, GMVs in left Rolandic operculum, right cingulate, bilateral hippocampi, left Heschl's gyrus, and Global MD of WM were found to correlate with memory loss (p value <0.05). GMVs in the right cingulate gyrus and left hippocampus were related to smell loss (p value <0.05). MD-GM score, global GMV, and GMV in right cingulate gyrus were correlated with LDH level (p value <0.05).

430010,Selective Lobe Ventilation and a Novel Platform for Pulmonary Drug Delivery,2021,"OBJECTIVES: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is a pandemic with no specific therapeutic agents and substantial mortality, and finding new treatments is critical. Most cases are mild, but a significant minority of patients develop moderate to severe respiratory symptoms, with the most severe cases requiring intensive care and/or ventilator support. This respiratory compromise appears to be due to a hyperimmune reaction, often called a cytokine storm. Vagus nerve stimulation has been demonstrated to block production of cytokines in sepsis and other medical conditions. We hypothesize that non-invasive vagus nerve stimulation (nVNS) might provide clinical benefits in patients with respiratory symptoms similar to those associated with COVID-19. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Information on two case reports was obtained via email correspondence and phone interviews with the patients. RESULTS: Both patients reported clinically meaningful benefits from nVNS therapy. In case 1, the patient used nVNS to expedite symptomatic recovery at home after hospital discharge and was able to discontinue use of opioid and cough suppressant medications. In case 2, the patient experienced immediate and consistent relief from symptoms of chest tightness and shortness of breath, as well as an improved ability to clear his lungs. CONCLUSIONS: Preliminary observations and a strong scientific foundation suggest that nVNS might provide clinical benefits in patients with COVID-19 via multiple mechanisms.","Staats, Peter; Giannakopoulos, Georgios; Blake, Justyna; Liebler, Eric; Levy, Robert M",Neuromodulation,,416

Following small-scale optimization and screening studies, we demonstrate bioreactor productions of highly relevant vaccines and vaccine candidates against Ebola virus disease, HIV, and coronavirus disease 2019 in the Vero suspension system. rVSV-ZEBOV, rVSV-HIV, and rVSVInd -msp-SF -Gtc can replicate to high titers in the bioreactor, reaching 3.87 × 107 TCID50 /ml, 2.12 × 107 TCID50 /ml, and 3.59 × 109 TCID50 /ml, respectively. Furthermore, we compare cell-specific productivities, and the quality of the produced viruses by determining the ratio of total viral particles to infectious viral particles.","Kiesslich, Sascha; Kim, Gyoung N; Shen, Chun F; Kang, C Yong; Kamen, Amine A",Biotechnol Bioeng,,416
440697,The clinical characteristics of myocardial injury in severe and very severe patients with 2019 novel coronavirus disease,2020,"This article is a descriptive and reflective piece on the strategic adaptations that facilitated and enabled the teaching of anatomy and related basic medical sciences to medical students in an African medical school that never shut down during the COVID-19 induced lockdown of the year 2020. The article considers the roles of educational technology, innovations, media and how these were used to achieve learning objectives with optimal outcomes during the lockdown. Specific technologies and innovations including the Anatomage Table, Complete 3D Anatomy software, and the use of High-Fidelity Mannequin were deployed to facilitate effective teaching of anatomy and related basic medical sciences. This was aided by the robust use of a learning management system - Canvas, as well as internet facility for connection, videoconferencing, online sessions and online-based assessment in a strategically organised manner. This system was dynamic enough to respond to changes in COVID-19 related government policies including the lockdown and social distancing-related adjustments in the physical settings. The outcome was that the teaching of medical students did not stop, and optimal results were achieved. The article considers the roles of educational technology and innovations as well as the media and how these were used to achieve learning objectives with optimal outcomes during the lockdown. It is believed that this experiential piece would inspire and inform other medical schools on the benefit of building robustly dynamic medical school systems as well as the use of innovations in times of challenges. The article also considers both the limitations and benefits of technology in teaching anatomy. Very importantly, specific tools, innovations, and technologies were considered as used, and the information provided might be a guide for other potential users. Ultimately, the lesson learned would be of use to us and we believe we could also benefit many others.","Owolabi, J.; Bekele, A.",Adv Med Educ Pract,,416

440995,COVID-19 Related Ocular Hypertension Secondary to Anterior Uveitis as Part of a Multi-systemic Inflammatory Syndrome,2021,"In the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, countries across the globe undertook several stringent movement restrictions to prevent the virus spread. In April 2020, around 3.9 billion people in 90 countries were contained in their homes. Discourse on the ethical questions raised by such restrictions while historically rich is absent when it comes to pragmatic policy considerations by the decision-makers. Drawing from the existing literature, we present a unified ethical principles-pragmatic considerations-policy indicators framework flexibly applicable across different countries and contexts to assess the ethical soundness of movement-restricting policies. Our framework consolidates 11 unique but related ethical principles (harm, justifiability, proportionality, least restrictive means, utility efficiency, reciprocity, transparency, relevance, equity, accountability, and cost and feasibility). We mapped each ethical principle to answerable questions or pragmatic considerations to subsequently generate 34 policy indicators. These policy indicators can help policymakers and health practitioners to decide the ethically substantiated initiation of movement restrictions, monitor progress and systematically evaluate the imposed restrictions. As an example, we applied the framework to evaluate the first two phases of the largest lockdown (March-May 2020) implemented nationwide in India for its adherence to ethical principles. The policy indicators revealed ethical lapses in proportionality, utility efficiency and accountability for India's lockdown that should be focused on in subsequent restrictions. The framework possesses value towards ensuring that movement-restrictive public health interventions across different parts of the world in the ongoing pandemic and possible future outbreaks are ethically sound.","Zadey, Siddhesh; Dharmadhikari, Surabhi; Mukuntharaj, Pradeeksha",,,416

DESIGN: a population-based retrospective cohort study on prospectively collected data was conducted. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: the cohort included all swab positive cases aged 40 years older (No. 18,286) among residents in the territory of the Milan's Agency for Health Protection (ATS-MI) up to 27.04.2020. Data on comorbidities were obtained from the ATS administrative database of chronic conditions. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: to predict 30-day mortality risk, a multivariable logistic regression model, including age, gender, and the selected conditions, was developed following the TRIPOD guidelines. Discrimination and calibration of the model were assessed. RESULTS: after age and gender, the most important predictors of 30-day mortality were diabetes, tumour in first-line treatment, chronic heart failure, and complicated diabetes. The bootstrap-validated c-index was 0.78, which suggests that this model is useful in predicting death after COVID-19 infection in swab positive cases. The model had good discrimination (Brier score 0.13) and was well calibrated (Index of prediction accuracy of 14.8%). CONCLUSIONS: a risk prediction model for 30-day mortality in a large COVID-19 cohort aged 40 years or older was developed. In a new epidemic wave, it would help to define groups at different risk and to identify high-risk subjects to target for specific prevention and therapeutic strategies.","Andreano, Anita; Murtas, Rossella; Tunesi, Sara; Gervasi, Federico; Magnoni, Pietro; Russo, Antonio Giampiero",Epidemiol Prev,,416

Residencies must develop new strategies to provide patient care while ensuring the health and continued education of trainees. We aimed to describe the evolving impact of COVID-19 on orthopaedic surgery residents. METHODS: We surveyed five Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education-accredited orthopaedic residency programs within cities highly affected by the COVID-19 pandemic about clinical and curricular changes. An online questionnaire surveyed individual resident experiences related to COVID-19. RESULTS: One hundred twenty-one resident survey responses were collected. Sixty-five percent of the respondents have cared for a COVID-19-positive patient. One in three reported being unable to obtain institutionally recommended personal protective equipment during routine clinical work. All programs have discontinued elective orthopaedic cases and restructured resident rotations. Most have shifted schedules to periods of active clinical duty followed by periods of remote work and self-isolation. Didactic education has continued via videoconferencing. DISCUSSION: COVID-19 has caused unprecedented changes to orthopaedic training; however, residents remain on the front lines of inpatient care. Exposures to COVID-19 are prevalent and residents have fallen ill. Programs currently use a variety of strategies to provide essential orthopaedic care. We recommend continued prioritization of resident safety and necessary training accommodations.","An, Tonya W; Henry, Jensen K; Igboechi, Oduche; Wang, Pengcheng; Yerrapragada, Aditya; Lin, Carol A; Paiement, Guy D",J Am Acad Orthop Surg,,416

However, partly due to damages associated with the pandemic and the ensuing euphoria over vaccines' arrival, some of the challenges are mostly being ignored or not recognized. This paper identifies some pitfalls and drawbacks in vaccine delivery. We argue that the somewhat unique tension between the speed of vaccine delivery and its scale can create opportunities for corrupt behavior that are often at odds with effective means to check abuse. While data on instances of abuse will emerge over time, it is useful to point out different avenues of abuse so that some preventive government actions can be undertaken. Specifically, we argue that the potential for out of turn delivery of vaccines and the stockpiling by unauthorized agents creates incentives for corruption, with the public or bureaucrats initiating corrupt transactions. An understanding of the potential avenues for corruption should guide the formulation of appropriate corruption-control policies and similar challenges that will be faced by policy makers in addressing future pandemics.","Goel, Rajeev K; Nelson, Michael A; Goel, Viraat Y",Journal of policy modeling,,416

Understanding the severity and distribution in various regions will help in planning the controlling measures. Objectives: The objective was to assess the distribution and growth rate of COVID-19 infection in Tamil Nadu, India. Methods: The data on the number of infections of COVID-19 have been obtained from the media reports released by the Government of Tamil Nadu. The data contain information on the incidence of the disease for the first 41 days of the outbreak started on March 7, 2020. Log-linear model has been used to estimate the progression of the COVID-19 infection in Tamil Nadu. Separate models were employed to model the growth rate and decay rate of the disease. Spatial Poisson regression was used to identify the high-risk areas in the state. Results: : The models estimated the doubling time for the number of cases in growth phase as 3.96 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.70, 9.42) days and halving time in the decay phase as 12.08 (95% CI: 6.79, 54.78) days. The estimated median reproduction numbers were 1.88 (min = 1.09, max = 2.51) and 0.76 (min = 0.56, max = 0.99) in the growth and decay phases, respectively. The spatial Poisson regression identified 11 districts as high risk. Conclusion: The results indicate that the outbreak is showing decay in the number of infections of the disease which highlights the effectiveness of controlling measures.","Bhaskar, Adhin; Ponnuraja, Chinnaiyan; Srinivasan, Ramalingam; Padmanaban, Srinivasan",Indian J Public Health,,416

Complications such as hypertension, diabetes, COPD, cardiovascular disease, and cerebrovascular disease are major risk factors for patients with COVID-19. METHODS: No meta-analysis has explored if or not diabetes related to mortality of patients with COVID-19. Therefore, this meta-analysis first aims to explore the possible clinical mortality between diabetes and COVID-19, analyze if diabetes patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 are exposed to the worst clinical prognostic risk, and to evaluate the reliability of the evidence. RESULTS: Our results showed a close relationship between diabetes and mortality of COVID-19, with a pooled OR of 1.75 (95% CI 1.31-2.36; P = 0.0002). The pooled data were calculated with the fixed effects model (FEM) as no heterogeneity appeared in the studies. Sensitivity analysis showed that after omitting any single study or converting a random effect model to FEM, the main results still held. CONCLUSIONS: Our meta-analysis showed that diabetes increases the mortality of patients with COVID-19. These results indicated the disturbance of blood glucose in the COVID-19 patients. More importantly, this meta-analysis grades the reliability of evidence for further basic and clinical research into the diabetes dysfunction in COVID-19 patients.","Wu, Zeng-Hong; Tang, Yun; Cheng, Qing",Acta diabetol,,416

Preclinical studies have suggested that priming the immune system with various modalities in addition to checkpoint inhibition may overcome the relative T-cell exhaustion or senescence; however, in this small data set, radiotherapy with checkpoint inhibition did not appear to activate the antitumor immune response. BACKGROUND: Extramedullary disease (EMD) is recognized as an aggressive subentity of multiple myeloma (MM) with a need for novel therapeutic approaches. We therefore designed a proof-of-principle pilot study to evaluate the synergy between the combination of the anti-PD-L1, avelumab, and concomitant hypofractionated radiotherapy. METHODS: This was a single-arm phase II Simon two-stage single center study that was prematurely terminated because of the COVID-19 pandemic after enrolling four patients. Key eligibility included patients with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma (RRMM) who had exhausted or were not candidates for standard therapy and had at least one lesion amenable to radiotherapy. Patients received avelumab until progression or intolerable toxicity and hypofractionated radiotherapy to a focal lesion in cycle 2. Radiotherapy was delayed until cycle 2 to allow the avelumab to reach a study state, given the important observation from previous studies that concomitant therapy is needed for the abscopal effect. RESULTS: At a median potential follow-up of 10.5 months, there were no objective responses, one minimal response, and two stable disease as best response. The median progression-free survival (PFS) was 5.3 months (95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.5-7.1 months), and no deaths occurred. There were no grade &#8805;3 and five grade 1-2 treatment-related adverse events. CONCLUSION: Avelumab in combination with radiotherapy for patients with RRMM and EMD was associated with very modest systemic clinical benefit; however, patients did benefit as usual from local radiotherapy. Furthermore, the combination was very well tolerated compared with historical RRMM treatment regimens.","Kazandjian, Dickran; Dew, Alexander; Hill, Elizabeth; Ramirez, Elizabeth Gil; Morrison, Candis; Mena, Esther; Lindenberg, Liza; Yuan, Constance; Maric, Irina; Wang, Hao-Wei; Calvo, Katherine; Dulau-Florea, Alina; Roswarski, Joseph; Emanuel, Michael; Braylan, Raul; Turkbey, Baris; Choyke, Peter; Camphausen, Kevin; Stetler-Stevenson, Maryalice; Steinberg, Seth M; Figg, William D; C Jones, Jennifer",Oncologist,,416

469254,533. Demographic and Prognostic Indicators in COVID-19 Patients with ESRD: A Single Center Retrospective Study,2020,"The literature on the interplay between geographic communities and organizations has largely ignored the role of individual residents. In adopting a meso-perspective, we examine a potentially vital relationship between corporate conduct and pro-social behavior demanding sacrifice from individuals. Drawing on Weber (Economy and society: an outline of interpretive sociology. University of California Press, Berkeley, 1978 (Translation of Wirtschaft und Gesellschaft, Grundriss der verstehenden Soziologie, 1922)), we theorize that organizations in a community legitimize personal social conduct in three ways-by serving as role models, imparting norms and values, and routinizing forms of interaction. We study the relationship between corporate social responsibility (CSR) behavior by local firms and the social distancing (SD) of citizens in US counties during the Covid-19 pandemic, a core ethical outcome. We argue and find that the residents of communities in which firms exhibit higher levels of CSR engaged in more SD during the Covid-19 pandemic. This was true when firms were (a) long-established, (b) isomorphic in their CSR, and (c) major employers and vendors. Moreover, CSR relating to the treatment of employees as well as positive and negative extremes in CSR bore especially strong relationships with SD. Implications are drawn for the study of business ethics, as modeled by CSR, as a force for ethical personal behavior and public health in communities.","Miller, Danny; Tang, Zhenyang; Xu, Xiaowei; Le Breton-Miller, Isabelle",J Bus Ethics,,416

Rapid assessment and warning are crucial for an outbreak analysis in response to serious public health. SARS-CoV-2 shares highly homological sequences with SARS-CoVs causing highly lethal pneumonia with respiratory distress and clinical symptoms similar to those reported for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV infections. Notably, some COVID-19 patients also expressed neurologic signs like nausea, headache, and vomiting. Several studies have reported that coronaviruses are not only causing respiratory illness but also invade the central nervous system through a synapse-connected route. SARS-CoV infections are reported in both patients and experimental animals' brains. Interestingly, some COVID-19 patients have shown the presence of SARS-CoV-2 virus in their cerebrospinal fluid. Considering the similarities between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 in various aspects, it remains to clarify whether the potent invasion of SARS-CoV-2 may affect in COVID-19 patients. All these indicate that more detailed criteria are needed for the treatment and the prevention of SARS-CoV-2 infected patients. In the absence of potential interventions for COVID-19, there is an urgent need for an alternative strategy to control the spread of this disease.","Yashavantha Rao, H C; Jayabaskaran, Chelliah",J Med Virol,,416

472085,COVID-19 and Tuberculosis Coinfection in a 51-Year-Old Taxi Driver in Mexico City,2020,"OBJECTIVES: To investigate the association of risk of venous thromboembolism with 30-day mortality in COVID-19 patients. METHODS: A total of 1030 COVID-19 patients were retrospectively collected, with baseline data on demographics, sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score, and VTE risk assessment models (RAMs), including Padua prediction score (PPS), International Medical Prevention Registry (IMPROVE), and Caprini. RESULTS: Thirty-day mortality increased progressively from 2% in patients at low VTE risk to 63% in those at high risk defined by PPS. Similar findings were observed in IMPROVE and Caprini scores. Progressive increases in VTE risk were also associated with higher SOFA score. High risk of VTE was independently associated with mortality regardless of adjusted gender, smoking status and some comorbidities, with hazard ratios of 29.19, 37.37 and 20.60 for PPS, IMPROVE and Caprini RAM, respectively (P < 0.001 for all comparisons). The predictive accuracy of PPS (area under curve (AUC) 0.900), IMPROVE (AUC 0.917), or Caprini (AUC 0.861) RAM for risk of hospitalized mortality was unexpectedly strong. CONCLUSIONS: We established that the presence of a high risk of VTE identifies a group of COVID-19 patients at higher risk for mortality. Furthermore, there is a high accuracy of VTE RAMs to predict mortality in these patients.","Chen, Shujing; Zheng, Tianqi; Wang, Sihua; Yu, Yongfu; Wang, Peng; Song, Yuanlin; Jiang, Jinjun",Int J Infect Dis,,416
472590,Effectiveness and applicability of Non-Invasive Ventilation (NIV) in the Emergency Department in acute respiratory failure due to Sars-CoV-2 pneumonia,2020,"PURPOSE: To examine possible changes in the emergency patient volume and reasons for presentation to an oral and maxillofacial surgery department during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and the resulting contact prohibitions. We hypothesized that the pandemic would lead to fewer patients presenting with emergent conditions. METHODS: A total of 939 patients, who presented to the Department for Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery of Hannover Medical School during the first 4 weeks of contact prohibitions in Germany, starting from March 23, 2020 until April 19, 2020, and in comparable periods were examined. The number of patients, reason for presentation, and required treatments were documented and compared to the years 2018 and 2019. Special attention was paid to the changes in trauma cases. RESULTS: We found that the number of patients in 2020 was significantly lower (P(2019) < .001, P(2018) < .01), but sex and age distributions were comparable to those in the previous years. Both the absolute and relative frequencies of dental diagnoses were significantly lower in 2020 (P(2019) < .001, P(2018) < .001), while the proportion of patients who presented with trauma was significantly higher (P(2019) < .001, P(2018) < .001). A significant decrease in patient number to the hospital, despite private practices being closed, was presumably due to patients' infection-related concerns. Trauma cases were more frequent in private settings, and traumatic events under the influence of alcohol were frequent. The circumstances and not the absolute number of trauma events had changed. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study suggest that the COVID-19 pandemic has important effects on the use of emergency services concerning oral and maxillofacial surgery in Germany.","Lentge, Fritjof; Jehn, Philipp; Zeller, Alexander Nicolai; Spalthoff, Simon; Rahlf, Björn; Korn, Philippe",J. oral maxillofac. surg,,416

474814,A case of coronavirus disease 2019 with twice negative nucleic acid testing within 8 days,2020,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the virus SARS-CoV-2, is an acute respiratory disease that has been classified as a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO). The sudden spike in the number of infections and high mortality rates have put immense pressure on the public healthcare systems. Hence, it is crucial to identify the key factors for mortality prediction to optimize patient treatment strategy. Different routine blood test results are widely available compared to other forms of data like X-rays, CT-scans, and ultrasounds for mortality prediction. This study proposes machine learning (ML) methods based on blood tests data to predict COVID-19 mortality risk. A powerful combination of five features: neutrophils, lymphocytes, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), and age helps to predict mortality with 96% accuracy. Various ML models (neural networks, logistic regression, XGBoost, random forests, SVM, and decision trees) have been trained and performance compared to determine the model that achieves consistently high accuracy across the days that span the disease. The best performing method using XGBoost feature importance and neural network classification, predicts with an accuracy of 90% as early as 16 days before the outcome. Robust testing with three cases based on days to outcome confirms the strong predictive performance and practicality of the proposed model. A detailed analysis and identification of trends was performed using these key biomarkers to provide useful insights for intuitive application. This study provide solutions that would help accelerate the decision-making process in healthcare systems for focused medical treatments in an accurate, early, and reliable manner.","Karthikeyan, Akshaya; Garg, Akshit; Vinod, P K; Priyakumar, U Deva",Front Public Health,,416

In addition, we examined whether statin therapy affects hospital mortality among COVID-19 patients. The National Health Insurance Service (NHIS)-COVID-19 database in South Korea was used for data extraction for this population-based cohort study. A total of 122,040 adult individuals, with 22,633 (18.5%) in the statin therapy group and 101,697 (91.5%) in the control group, were included in the analysis. Among them, 7780 (6.4%) individuals were diagnosed with COVID-19 and hospital mortality occurred in 251 (3.2%) COVID-19 cases. After propensity score matching, logistic regression analysis showed that the odds of developing COVID-19 were 35% lower in the statin therapy group than in the control group (odds ratio: 0.65, 95% confidence interval: 0.60 to 0.71; p < 0.001). Regarding hospital mortality among COVID-19 patients, the multivariable model indicated that there were no differences between the statin therapy and control groups (odds ratio: 0.74, 95% confidence interval: 0.52 to 1.05; p = 0.094). Statin therapy may have potential benefits for the prevention of COVID-19 in South Korea. However, we found that statin therapy does not affect the hospital mortality of patients who are diagnosed with COVID-19.","Oh, Tak Kyu; Song, In-Ae; Jeon, Young-Tae",,,416

Our objective was to estimate the prevalence and correlates of post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC). METHODS: We employed a population-based probability survey of adults with COVID-19 in Michigan. Living non-institutionalized adults aged 18+ in the Michigan Disease Surveillance System with COVID-19 onset through mid-April 2020 were eligible for selection (n=28,000). Among 2,000 selected, 629 completed the survey between June - December 2020. We estimated PASC prevalence, defined as persistent symptoms 30+ (30-day COVID-19) or 60+ days (60-day COVID-19) post COVID-19 onset, overall and by sociodemographic and clinical factors, including self-reported symptom severity and hospitalization status. We used modified Poisson regression to produce adjusted prevalence ratios (aPR) for potential risk factors. RESULTS: The analytic sample (n=593) was predominantly female (56.1%), aged 45 and older (68.2%), and Non-Hispanic White (46.3%) or Black (34.8%). 30- and 60-day COVID-19 were highly prevalent (52.5% and 35.0%), even among non-hospitalized respondents (43.7% and 26.9%) and respondents reporting mild symptoms (29.2% and 24.5%). Respondents reporting very severe (vs. mild) symptoms had 2.25 times higher prevalence of 30-day COVID-19 ([aPR] 2.25, 95% CI 1.46-3.46) and 1.71 times higher prevalence of 60-day COVID-19 (aPR 1.71, 95% 1.02-2.88). Hospitalized (vs. non-hospitalized) respondents had about 40% higher prevalence of both 30-day (aPR 1.37, 95% CI 1.12-1.69) and 60-day COVID-19 (aPR 1.40, 95% CI 1.02-1.93). CONCLUSIONS: PASC is highly prevalent among cases reporting severe initial symptoms, and, to a lesser extent, cases reporting mild and moderate symptoms.","Hirschtick, Jana L; Titus, Andrea R; Slocum, Elizabeth; Power, Laura E; Hirschtick, Robert E; Elliott, Michael R; McKane, Patricia; Fleischer, Nancy L",Clin. infect. dis,,416
479406,128 Attitudes Towards the COVID-19 Vaccine in an Inner-City Dialysis Population,2021,"BACKGROUND: Impairments of the forearm, wrist, and hand affect a sizable proportion of individuals and impose a significant economic burden on health care systems. FEPSim is a medical device for hand and wrist rehabilitation. The FEPSim device could be part of the standard of care for upper extremity rehabilitation during therapeutic activities to increase range of motion, dexterity, and strength. FEPSim has not yet been tested in a health care setting; therefore, a trial of the effectiveness of FEPSim in upper extremity rehabilitation is warranted. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to assess the feasibility of conducting a definitive trial in terms of recruitment, eligibility criteria, the type and number of diagnoses included, the length and dosage of the intervention, and data collection methods. This study also aims to gather clinical and statistical information as well as information related to the cost and usability, which allows for an economic evaluation of the device. METHODS: The trial will use a randomized controlled design comprising 47 intervention participants and 47 control group participants. Participants will be adults (age&#8805;18 years) attending outpatient rehabilitation with limitations in their forearm, wrist, or hand function due to distal radial or ulnar fractures, stroke, or osteoarthritis. This study's primary outcome variables are related to patients' range of motion and strength, specifically active and passive wrist flexion and extension range of motion; active and passive forearm pronation and supination range of motion; grip strength; and pinch strength. The secondary outcome variables are related to patients' perceived wrist pain and disability in activities of daily living. The patients' perceived wrist pain and disability in activities of daily living will be measured using the patient-rated wrist evaluation questionnaire. The control group will receive the standard of care at each of the 2 hospital facilities (Glenrose Rehabilitation and Royal Alexandra Hospitals). The intervention group will receive the same standard of care as the control group at each facility and will use the FEPSim device for therapeutic activities to increase strength, range of motion, resistance, and dexterity. All the participants will be assessed at baseline (week 0); weeks 2, 4, and 8; and postintervention (week 10). RESULTS: The FEPSim study was launched in April 2020. This study is currently on hold because of the global COVID-19 pandemic. The recruitment process is expected to resume by September 2020, and the primary impact analysis is expected to be conducted by December 2020. CONCLUSIONS: This study will provide valuable information on the measurement of comparative intervention effects, technology acceptance by hand therapists, and how associated treatment and product costs will contribute to the evidence planning process, which will be crucial for the future adoption of FEPSim.

Direct economic loss is expected to be much more than that of SARS outbreak in 2003. The risk factors of COVID-19 epidemic at the early stage incluede the misjudgment of the epidemic, delay in reporting this emerging infectious disease, nosocomial infection-caused transmission of the virus into local communities, and weak public health interventions. The infection rate (or the incidence) reflects the prophylactic effect in population. Case fatality reflects the therapeutic effect of clinical intervention. There were sufficient medical resources at the national top levels accumulated in Wuhan. Furthermore, medical professionals and sufficient medical supplies from other provinces have been assigned to join in the fighting against the epidemic in Wuhan. However, the case fatality in Wuhan has being kept the highest in China, indicating that clinical treatment for this virus-caused emerging infectious disease, whose pathogenesis remains to be elucidated, had a limited effect in controlling this epidemic. The unusual, extremely costly public health interventions including the temporarily city quarantine and transportation ban issued by the central government are crucial in controlling this epidemic. The control of epidemic indicates the importance of public health measures but also reflected its insufficient capacity in China. Recently, profit-seeking mechanism run in Chinese health service system disorganized the balance of clinical service and public health service patterns in China, promoting the vicious circle of ""attaching importance to clinical treatment and despising disease prophylaxis"" , damaging the infrastructure of public health capacity, thus contributing to the formation of the inevitability in various fortuities of public health emergency. To strength the capacity of our medical service system to respond to public health emergency efficiently, two key issues should be considered. First, public health service, which should be fixed as the health section of the governments' public services by the law, must be greatly improved to meet the increasing health needs of the publics. Second, the vicious circle of profit-seeking-caused ""attaching importance to clinical treatment and despising disease prophylaxis"" should be immediately broken to optimize the national health service system in China by increasing the investment in public health service.","Cao, G W; Zhang, B X; Chen, X P",Zhonghua Liu Xing Bing Xue Za Zhi,,416

While hospitals were aware of the potential of COVID-19, the volume of critically ill patients that flooded the hospitals in the New York City area was clearly not anticipated. Hospital staff worked quickly to create COVID-19-free areas, but were overcome with the volume of COVID-positive critically ill patients. Many newly admitted patients required respiratory support with mechanical ventilation. As Governor Cuomo issued executive orders to stay at home in mid-March, some patients were afraid to go into hospitals despite symptoms of respiratory distress. Once these patients came to the hospital, they were often critically ill. Emergency departments and intensive care units filled rapidly, overwhelming staff and equipment needs with such things as pumps, dialysis machines, medications, and personal protective equipment. Plans for the day were disrupted with frequent rapid response calls and the need for additional beds.

It evaluates the Global Reporting Initiative's (GRI) framework, designed as a guide for best-practice in sustainability reporting, for its applicability to cover COVID-19 issues and, more generally, issues arising in crisis conditions. Design/methodology/approach The GRI's COVID-19 communications and the GRI framework are reviewed using three common theories of reporting, namely, institutional, stakeholder and legitimacy theory. For each theory, the authors contrast expectations under business-as-usual conditions against crisis conditions to identify gaps and avenues to guide COVID-19 responses. Findings This commentary opines the GRI framework risks perpetuating incremental change towards the ""new normal"", rather than motivating the urgent responses needed in a crisis. The GRI can play a significant normative role to guide immediate and short-term best practice in COVID-19 reporting. Findings motivate the need to report for vulnerable rather than powerful stakeholders and to recognise and celebrate proactive change. Originality/value This paper commentates on the suitability of a major sustainability reporting framework and its role in improving responses to the current COVID-19 crisis.

Here, the association of older adults' expectations concerning the pandemic's duration and impact with perceived stress (PS) and negative affect (NA) are investigated. Based on the stress and coping framework, PS is expected to mediate the association between COVID-19 expectations and NA. METHOD: 714 residents of the US and aged 60 and older completed an anonymous online survey in late March 2020 reporting PS, NA, and expectations regarding the pandemic. RESULTS: Regression analyses controlling for demographic factors revealed that more dire pandemic expectations significantly predicted PS and NA directly, and the effects on NA were significantly mediated by PS. DISCUSSION: Findings provide evidence that expectations about a pandemic influence the extent to which older adults experience stress and NA in the midst of a pandemic event.

488390,Risk of Severe Coronavirus Disease 2019 in Patients With Inflammatory Bowel Disease in the United States: A Multicenter Research Network Study,2020,"The rapid outbreak of COVID-19 threatens humans life all around the world. Due to insufficient diagnostic infrastructures, developing an accurate, efficient, inexpensive, and quick diagnostic tool is of great importance. As chest radiography, such as chest X-ray (CXR) and CT computed tomography (CT), is a possible way for screening COVID-19, developing an automatic image classification tool is immensely helpful for detecting the patients with COVID-19. To date, researchers have proposed several different screening methods; however, none of them could achieve a reliable and highly sensitive performance yet. The main drawbacks of current methods are the lack of having enough training data, low generalization performance, and a high rate of false-positive detection. To tackle such limitations, this study firstly builds a large-size publicly available CT-scan dataset, consisting of more than 13k CT-images of more than 1000 individuals, in which 8k images are taken from 500 patients infected with COVID-19. Secondly, we propose a deep learning model for screening COVID-19 using our proposed CT dataset and report the baseline results. Finally, we extend the proposed CT model for screening COVID-19 from CXR images using a transfer learning approach. The experimental results show that the proposed CT and CXR methods achieve the AUC scores of 0.886 and 0.984 respectively.","Dialameh, Maryam; Hamzeh, Ali; Rahmani, Hossein; Radmard, Amir Reza; Dialameh, Safoura",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.14204v2.pdf,416

488511,Choroidal melanoma treatment in times of coronavirus disease 2019,2021,"BACKGROUND: The first wave of COVID-19 swept over France during the first quarter of 2020, leading to saturation of the health care system. We wished to study, in a French military medical unit assisting one of the country's largest armed forces populations, the impact of teleconsultation and the systematic isolation of all possible, probable and confirmed cases of COVID-19. METHODS: This is a retrospective study carried out from March 9 to May 31, 2020 on the basis of our activity register. The variables collected included type of medical consultation procedure, occupational status, classification of cases and date of onset of first symptoms. We have paralleled our activity with that of SOS Médecins and the emergency departments of the Île-de-France region. RESULTS/DISCUSSION: During this period, 1719 episodes of care (teleconsultations or physical consultations) were recorded, of which 91% (n=1561) were linked to COVID-19. We identified 598 ""suspected"" (possible and probable) and confirmed cases. ""Isolated"" teleconsultations (not followed by a face-to-face medical consultation, sample taking or necessitating the dispatch of prompt assistance) represented 86% of episodes of care (n=1482). Comparison of our activity and the number of new cases with the databases of SOS Médecins and the Île-de-France emergency services suggests that our isolation strategy was timely and effective. CONCLUSION: The contribution of teleconsultation was substantial and reassuring. Teleconsultation makes it possible to absorb a large volume of patients, is easy to implement, and entails no nosocomial risk. Isolation of infected patients should be a priority during an outbreak. Once it has become a priority to rapidly bring an epidemic under control, this attitude must be extended to all symptomatic patients.","Allonneau, A; Villeneuve, J-P; Sempere, H; Couderc, A; Nicaise, A; Soula, M; Kerrien, C; Minaberry, S; Bertrand, M; Mourougou, M; Coste, S",Rev Epidemiol Sante Publique,,416

Medical personnel, especially those in direct contact with COVID-19 patients, could have increased levels of stress, anxiety, and depression. The objective of this study was to explore the mental health status of medical personnel in Serbia during the pandemic by assessing stress levels, symptoms of anxiety, and depression. METHODS: This cross-sectional study was conducted as an online-based survey, in the period from 8 April to 14 April 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic. The study included 1678 participants, and the snowball sampling technique was used to reach healthcare professionals. The level of stress and symptoms of depression and anxiety were assessed among medical personnel in Serbia by the 10-item Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), the Beck Depression Inventory IA (BDI-IA), and the 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale (GAD-7), respectively. RESULTS: A total of 1678 participants completed the survey, with a mean age of 40.38 ± 10.32 years, of which 1,315 (78.4%) were women, and 363 (21.6%) were men. Out of these, 684 (40.8%) participants were medical personnel, and 994 (59.2%) were people of other professions. Frontline medical personnel reported higher scores on all measurement tools than second-line medical personnel (e.g., mean PSS scores: 19.12 ± 5.66 versus 17.53 ± 5.71; p = .006; mean GAD-7 scores: 8.57 ± 6.26 versus 6.73 ± 5.76; p = .001; mean BDI-IA scores: 9.25 ± 8.26 versus 7.36 ± 7.28; p = .006). Binary logistic regression showed that the probability of developing more severe anxiety symptoms doubles in frontline medical personnel. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that frontline medical personnel is under an increased psychological burden during the COVID-19 pandemic, having higher levels of stress, anxiety, and depression than second-line medical personnel. Adequate measures should be taken to relieve this burden and preserve the mental health of frontline medical personnel.","Antonijevic, Jovana; Binic, Iva; Zikic, Olivera; Manojlovic, Snezana; Tosic-Golubovic, Suzana; Popovic, Nikola",Brain Behav,,416

The principle of selecting the content of language education is presented (interaction of cultural, moral and professional aspects of language education, learning the culture, norms and etiquette of the studied language within the conceptualization of the content of education, etc.). To create and sustain a cultural environment in part of the content of language education we have identified and tested three its phases, including: the interaction of cultural, moral and professional aspects of language education in the course of conceptualization of the content of education;the implementation stage involved the active involvement and immersion of students in the study of culture;at the final stage, there was a summing up of the studied topics and an analysis of the results achieved. The optimal methods of language teaching (critical thinking development, communicative and immersion methods) are specified, which are aimed at improving the level of students' knowledge of culture and language, as well as their self-identification.

505228,Panic in the Pandemic: When Should Kidney Transplant Programs Close?,2021,"PURPOSE: We calculated the dosimetric indices and estimated the tumor control probability (TCP) considering six degree-of-freedom (6DoF) patient setup errors in stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) using a single-isocenter technique. METHODS: We used simulated spherical gross tumor volumes (GTVs) with diameters of 1.0 cm (GTV 1), 2.0 cm (GTV 2), and 3.0 cm (GTV 3), and the distance (d) between the target center and isocenter was set to 0, 5, and 10 cm. We created the dose distribution by convolving the blur component to uniform dose distribution. The prescription dose was 20 Gy and the dose distribution was adjusted so that D95 (%) of each GTV was covered by 100% of the prescribed dose. The GTV was simultaneously rotated within 0°-1.0° (Î´R) around the x-, y-, and z-axes and then translated within 0-1.0 mm (Î´T) in the x-, y-, and z-axis directions. D95, conformity index (CI), and conformation number (CN) were evaluated by varying the distance from the isocenter. The TCP was estimated by translating the calculated dose distribution into a biological response. In addition, we derived the x-y-z coordinates with the smallest TCP reduction rate that minimize the sum of squares of the residuals as the optimal isocenter coordinates using the relationship between 6DoF setup error, distance from isocenter, and GTV size. RESULTS: D95, CI, and CN were decreased with increasing isocenter distance, decreasing GTV size, and increasing setup error. TCP of GTVs without 6DoF setup error was estimated to be 77.0%. TCP were 25.8% (GTV 1), 35.0% (GTV 2), and 53.0% (GTV 3) with (d, Î´T, Î´R) = (10 cm, 1.0 mm, 1.0°). The TCP was 52.3% (GTV 1), 54.9% (GTV 2), and 66.1% (GTV 3) with (d, Î´T, Î´R) = (10 cm, 1.0 mm, 1.0°) at the optimal isocenter position. CONCLUSION: The TCP in SRS for multiple brain metastases with a single-isocenter technique may decrease with increasing isocenter distance and decreasing GTV size when the 6DoF setup errors are exceeded (1.0 mm, 1.0°). Additionally, it might be possible to better maintain TCP for GTVs with 6DoF setup errors by using the optimal isocenter position.","Nakano, Hisashi; Tanabe, Satoshi; Sasamoto, Ryuta; Takizawa, Takeshi; Utsunomiya, Satoru; Sakai, Madoka; Nakano, Toshimichi; Ohta, Atsushi; Kaidu, Motoki; Ishikawa, Hiroyuki",J. appl. clin. med. phys,,416

In the first half of the lockdown, migrant workers were stranded with no food and money with severe restrictions on movement when a mass exodus of workers back to their hometowns and villages began. In the second half, the workers' woes were compounded with a series of chaotic travel orders and gross mismanagement of the repatriation process. In this article, we draw on the work of Stranded Workers Action Network (SWAN) with more analysis and perspective. SWAN was a spontaneous relief effort that emerged soon after the lockdown was announced in March 2020. In addition to providing relief, SWAN concurrently documented the experiences of over 36,000 workers through the lockdown. We highlight the inadequacy of the government and judicial response to the migrant worker crisis. We present quantitative data elaborating the profile of workers that reached out to SWAN, the extent of hunger, loss of livelihoods and income. We also present qualitative insights based on interactions with workers and discuss multiple, non-exhaustive, dimensions of vulnerability to which migrant workers were exposed.","Adhikari, Anindita; Goregaonkar, Navmee; Narayanan, Rajendran; Panicker, Nishant; Ramamoorthy, Nithya",Indian J Labour Econ,,416

A 31-year-old patient who underwent bilateral lung transplantation for cystic fibrosis in 2012 was admitted for severe acute lower limb pain. He had a confirmed exposure to COVID-19 and a 3-week history of upper respiratory tract infection. Whole-body computed tomography (CT) angiography revealed an occlusion of the 2 common femoral arteries. CT angiography detected an intracardiac thrombus in the left ventricle. Chest CT angiography showed ground-glass opacities consistent with COVID-19. A bilateral femoral surgical embolectomy using Fogarty catheter was successfully performed. Specific reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 performed on an extracted thrombus was negative, but IgM antibodies specific for COVID-19 were detected. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated a subendocardial and almost transmural late gadolinium enhancement in the mid and distal inferolateral and inferior wall segments, consistent with a nonrecent myocardial infarction and an apical centimetric thrombus adjacent to the lesion. Thrombophilia laboratory tests found the presence of a positive lupus anticoagulant. Treatment with low-molecular-weight heparin and aspirin was prescribed. On day 13, the patient was discharged from the hospital. This case underlines the need to be vigilant with respect to the thrombotic complications of COVID-19 and raises the issue of thrombosis prevention in COVID-19 patients.","Renaud-Picard, Benjamin; Gallais, Floriane; Ohana, Mickael; Zeyons, Floriane; Kretz, Benjamin; Andre, Jocelyn; Sattler, Laurent; Hirschi, Sandrine; Kessler, Romain",Transplant Proc,,416

Its effects on the respiratory system of the susceptible population have been less characterized. This study aimed to estimate the association of short-term PM2.5 exposure with respiratory outcomes of the retired adults, and to examine whether these associations were stronger among the subjects with GSTT-null genotype. 32 healthy subjects (55-77 years) were recruited for five follow-up examinations. Ambient concentrations of PM2.5 were monitored consecutively for 7 days prior to physical examination. Pulmonary outcomes including forced vital capacity (FVC), forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1), peak expiratory flow (PEF), and fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO), and nasal fluid concentrations of 8-epi-prostaglandin F2 alpha (8-epi-PGF2&#945;), tumor necrosis factor-&#945; (TNF-&#945;), interleukin-8 (IL-8) and IL-1ß were measured. A linear mixed-effect model was introduced to evaluate the associations of PM2.5 concentrations with respiratory outcomes. Additionally, GSTT1 genotype-based stratification was performed to characterize modification on PM2.5-related respiratory outcomes. We found that a 10 µg/m3 increase in PM2.5 was associated with decreases of 0.52 L (95% confidence interval [CI]: -1.04, -0.002), 0.64 L (95% CI: -1.13, -0.16), 0.1 (95% CI: -0.23, 0.04) and 2.87 L/s (95% CI: -5.09, -0.64) in FVC, FEV1, FEV1/FVC ratio and PEF at lag 2, respectively. Meanwhile, marked increases of 80.82% (95% CI: 5.13%, 156.50%) in IL-8, 77.14% (95% CI: 1.88%, 152.40%) in IL-1ß and 67.87% (95% CI: 14.85%, 120.88%) in 8-epi-PGF2&#945; were observed as PM2.5 concentration increased by 10 µg/m3 at lag 2. Notably, PM2.5-associated decreases in FVC and PEF and increase in FeNO were stronger among the subjects with GSTT1-null genotype. In summary, short-term exposure to PM2.5 is associated with nasal inflammation, oxidative stress and lung function reduction in the retired subjects. Lung function reduction and inflammation are stronger among the subjects with GSTT1-null genotype.","Sun, Beibei; Song, Jie; Wang, Ya; Jiang, Jing; An, Zhen; Li, Juan; Zhang, Yange; Wang, Gui; Li, Huijun; Alexis, Neil E; Jaspers, Ilona; Wu, Weidong",Environ Pollut,,416
515430,Preventing Coronavirus Disease 2019 in Kidney Transplant Recipients: Where Should We Begin?,2021,"Tahun 2020 dunia menghadapi bencana pandemi global COVID-19 dan krisis kesehatan terbesar sejak Perang Dunia ke 2. Untuk mengatasi penyebaran wabah, hampir seluruh dunia menerapkan kebijakan “lockdown” atau penutupan negara atau kota dari migrasi termasuk pembatasan masuknya barang dan jasa. Krisis kesehatan mengakibatkan terhentinya aktivitas sosial, budaya, keagamaan, pendidikan, bisnis, dll, yang mempengaruhi perekonomian nasional secara signifikan. Untuk mencapai tujuan bersama mengatasi COVID-19, sangat diperlukan kerjasama internasional. Dunia dapat mengatasi krisis ini melalui Organisasi Kesehatan Dunia (WHO), yang berfokus mengatasi masalah kesehatan masyarakat dan penyebaran COVID-19. Untuk mengatasi isu keuangan global, kerjasama dapat dilakukan melalui Organisasi keuangan dunia termasuk G-20, yang merupakan kelompok negara-negara yang memiliki perekonomian kuat dan berpengaruh signifikan dalam skala global. Sayangnya kerjasama yang diharapkan belum sepenuhnya berhasil, diakibatkan perbedaan kepentingan, kurangnya koordinasi dan komunikasi diantara negara-negara anggota. Tidak ada satu negarapun yang mengantisipasi munculnya wabah COVID-19 sehingga diperlukan kerjasama internasional yang diawali dengan implementasi diplomasi yang efektif. Tidak saja aktor pemerintah yang terlibat tetapi juga aktor aktor non-pemerintah termasuk media massa. Artikel ini menganalisis diplomasi multijalur untuk menghadapi “the great lockdown”, dengan menerapkan konsep diplomasi multijalur dalam mendukung kebijakan pemerintah. Kehadiran aktor-aktor non-pemerintah yang memiliki sifat yang lebih fleksibel dibandingkan dengan aktor pemerintah diharapkan dapat mengatasi masalah koordinasi dan komunikasi yang seringkali menghambat efektivitas kerjasama. Diplomasi multijalur mengandaikan pemerintah yang berperan sebagai inisiator dan perancang kebijakan, melibatkan, menggerakkan, dan memberdayakan aktor-aktor non-pemerintah. Dengan berjalannya mekanisme diplomasi multijalur, maka semua elemen dan pemangku kepentingan dapat menjalankan peran yang optimal. Perlunya diplomasi multijalur dalam menerapkan kerjasama internasional agar tujuan bersama mengatasi COVID19 tercapai. Kesimpulan yang dapat ditarik dari situasi saat ini adalah minimnya keterlibatan aktor-aktor non-negara dalam kerjasama internasional menyebabkan kurang berhasilnya upaya-upaya penanggulangan COVID-19 secara optimal dalam tataran global. Ketika kerjasama global sudah berhasil mengatasi pandemic ini, perlu dipikirkan untuk merancang mekanisme baru untuk mengantisipasi berulangnya bencana serupa di masa mendatang.

519671,Impact of coronavirus disease 2019 on organ donation and transplantation in France,2020,"BACKGROUND: Pediatric diabetes clinics around the world rapidly adapted care in response to COVID-19. We explored provider perceptions of care delivery adaptations and challenges for providers and patients across nine international pediatric diabetes clinics. METHODS: Providers in a quality improvement collaborative completed a questionnaire about clinic adaptations, including roles, care delivery methods, and provider and patient concerns and challenges. We employed a rapid analysis to identify main themes. RESULTS: Providers described adaptations within multiple domains of care delivery, including provider roles and workload, clinical encounter and team meeting format, care delivery platforms, self-management technology education, and patient-provider data sharing. Providers reported concerns about potential negative impacts on patients from COVID-19 and the clinical adaptations it required, including fears related to telemedicine efficacy, blood glucose and insulin pump/pen data sharing, and delayed care-seeking. Particular concern was expressed about already vulnerable patients. Simultaneously, providers reported 'silver linings' of adaptations that they perceived as having potential to inform care and self-management recommendations going forward, including time-saving clinic processes, telemedicine, lifestyle changes compelled by COVID-19, and improvements to family and clinic staff literacy around data sharing. CONCLUSIONS: Providers across diverse clinical settings reported care delivery adaptations in response to COVID-19-particularly telemedicine processes-created challenges and opportunities to improve care quality and patient health. To develop quality care during COVID-19, providers emphasized the importance of generating evidence about which in-person or telemedicine processes were most beneficial for specific care scenarios, and incorporating the unique care needs of the most vulnerable patients.","Sarteau, Angelica Cristello; Souris, Katherine Janine; Wang, Jessica; Ramadan, Amira A; Addala, Ananta; Bowlby, Deborah; Corathers, Sarah; Forsander, Gun; King, Bruce; Law, Jennifer R; Liu, Wei; Malik, Faisal; Pihoker, Catherine; Seid, Michael; Smart, Carmel; Sundberg, Frida; Tandon, Nikhil; Yao, Michael; Headley, Terry; Mayer-Davis, Elizabeth",Pediatr. diabetes,,416
519672,Impact of coronavirus disease 2019 on organ donation and transplantation in France,2020,"Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV [SARS-COV-2]) was detected in humans during the last week of December 2019 at Wuhan city in China, and caused 24 554 cases in 27 countries and territories as of 5 February 2020. The objective of this study was to estimate the risk of transmission of 2019-nCoV through human passenger air flight from four major cities of China (Wuhan, Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou) to the passengers' destination countries. We extracted the weekly simulated passengers' end destination data for the period of 1-31 January 2020 from FLIRT, an online air travel dataset that uses information from 800 airlines to show the direct flight and passengers' end destination. We estimated a risk index of 2019-nCoV transmission based on the number of travellers to destination countries, weighted by the number of confirmed cases of the departed city reported by the World Health Organization (WHO). We ranked each country based on the risk index in four quantiles (4th quantile being the highest risk and 1st quantile being the lowest risk). During the period, 388 287 passengers were destined for 1297 airports in 168 countries or territories across the world. The risk index of 2019-nCoV among the countries had a very high correlation with the WHO-reported confirmed cases (0.97). According to our risk score classification, of the countries that reported at least one Coronavirus-infected pneumonia (COVID-19) case as of 5 February 2020, 24 countries were in the 4th quantile of the risk index, two in the 3rd quantile, one in the 2nd quantile and none in the 1st quantile. Outside China, countries with a higher risk of 2019-nCoV transmission are Thailand, Cambodia, Malaysia, Canada and the USA, all of which reported at least one case. In pan-Europe, UK, France, Russia, Germany and Italy; in North America, USA and Canada; in Oceania, Australia had high risk, all of them reported at least one case. In Africa and South America, the risk of transmission is very low with Ethiopia, South Africa, Egypt, Mauritius and Brazil showing a similar risk of transmission compared to the risk of any of the countries where at least one case is detected. The risk of transmission on 31 January 2020 was very high in neighbouring Asian countries, followed by Europe (UK, France, Russia and Germany), Oceania (Australia) and North America (USA and Canada). Increased public health response including early case recognition, isolation of identified case, contract tracing and targeted airport screening, public awareness and vigilance of health workers will help mitigate the force of further spread to naïve countries.","Haider, Najmul; Yavlinsky, Alexei; Simons, David; Osman, Abdinasir Yusuf; Ntoumi, Francine; Zumla, Alimuddin; Kock, Richard",Epidemiol Infect,,416
520097,Delayed manifestation of COVID-19 presenting as lower extremity multilevel arterial thrombosis: a case report,2020,"OBJECTIVE: To elucidate whether Amazon's virtual assistant, Alexa, provides evidence-based support as a supplement to provider-facilitated prenatal care, during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Using a conceptual content analysis approach, a query of 40 questions, relating to all phases of pregnancy, was collected from Alexa by two independent investigators, using two unique devices, over a one-week period between May 20, 2020 and May 27, 2020. Alexa's responses were matched to the evidence-based content from the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) and reviewed by a Certified Nurse Midwife for completeness and currency. RESULTS: Of the 40 questions asked of Alexa, it was unable to answer 14 questions (35%). A total of 21 out of the 40 responses (52%) were not evidence-based and three COVID-specific questions (about 1%) were answered incorrectly or insufficiently. Four questions (10%) were answered accurately. CONCLUSION: Alexa was largely unable to provide evidence-based answers to commonly asked pregnancy questions and, in many cases, supplied inaccurate, incomplete, or completely unrelated answers that could further confuse health consumers. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: Ensuring that mobile health (mhealth) tools, such as Amazon Alexa, are evidence-based and credible in answering common prenatal questions has important implications for this pandemic and future consumer needs.","Schindler-Ruwisch, Jennifer; Palancia Esposito, Christa",Patient educ. couns,,416

520647,Case Report: Pediatric Patient with COVID-19 and Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children,2020,"The quarantine of identified close contacts has been vital to reducing transmission rates and averting secondary infection risk before symptom onset and by asymptomatic cases. The effectiveness of this contact tracing strategy to mitigate transmission is sensitive to the adherence to quarantines, which may be lower for longer quarantine periods or in vaccinated populations (where perceptions of risk are reduced). This study develops a simulation model to evaluate contact tracing strategies based on the sequential testing of identified contacts after exposure as an alternative to quarantines, in which contacts are isolated only after confirmation by a positive test. The analysis considers different number and types of tests (PCR and lateral flow antigen tests (LFA)) to identify the cost-effective testing policies that minimize the expected infecting days post-exposure considering different levels of testing capacity. This analysis suggests that even a limited number of tests can be effective at reducing secondary infection risk: two LFA tests (with optimal timing) avert infectiousness at a level that is comparable to 14-day quarantine with 90\% adherence; adding a third test (PCR or LFA) reaches the efficiency of a 95\% quarantine adherence. These results are robust to the exposure dates of the contact, which suggests that simple testing rules can be effective for improving contact tracing in settings where strict quarantine adherence is difficult to implement.","Foncea, Patricio; Mondschein, Susana; Olivares, Marcelo",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2108.12938v1.pdf,416

Methods: A total of 204 Malaysian parents of children aged 2 to 11 years old were recruited for this study using a combination of purposive and snowball sampling approaches. Parents were required to fill an online questionnaire hosted on Google Forms, which consisted of socio-demographic characteristics (including child's gender, age, and ethnicity, as well as parental income during the MCO) and a 35-item list from the Children's Eating Behaviour Questionnaire (CEBQ). Data analysis was conducted by further stratifying the children's eating behaviour according to socio-demographic characteristics. Results: No significant differences were observed in the eating behaviour of the children across age and parental income groups during the MCO. Malaysian Indian children had significantly lower mean scores for the food responsiveness (2.50±0.64) and emotional over-eating (2.13±0.72) subscales than Malaysian Chinese children. Girls had a significantly higher mean score for the slowness in eating subscale during the MCO than boys.

As a tool to monitor public awareness, internet search engines have been widely used in public health emergencies. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to use online search data (Baidu Index) to monitor the public's attention and verify internet search engines' function in public attention monitoring of public health emergencies. METHODS: We collected the Baidu Index and the case monitoring data from January 20, 2020, to April 20, 2020. We combined the Baidu Index of keywords related to COVID-19 to describe the public attention's temporal trend and spatial distribution, and conducted the time lag cross-correlation analysis. RESULTS: The Baidu Index temporal trend indicated that the changes of the Baidu Index had a clear correspondence with the development time node of the pandemic. The Baidu Index spatial distribution showed that in the regions of central and eastern China, with denser populations, larger internet user bases, and higher economic development levels, the public was more concerned about COVID-19. In addition, the Baidu Index was significantly correlated with six case indicators of new confirmed cases, new death cases, new cured discharge cases, cumulative confirmed cases, cumulative death cases, and cumulative cured discharge cases. Moreover, the Baidu Index was 0-4 days earlier than new confirmed and new death cases, and about 20 days earlier than new cured and discharged cases while 3-5 days later than the change of cumulative cases. CONCLUSIONS: The national public's demand for epidemic information is urgent regardless of whether it is located in the hardest hit area. The public was more sensitive to the daily new case data that represents the progress of the epidemic, but the public's attention to the epidemic situation in other areas may lag behind. We could set the Baidu Index as the sentinel and the database in the online infoveillance system for infectious disease and public health emergencies. According to the monitoring data, the government needs to prevent and control the possible outbreak in advance and communicate the risks to the public so as to ensure the physical and psychological health of the public in the epidemic.","Gong, Xue; Han, Yangyang; Hou, Mengchi; Guo, Rui",JMIR Public Health Surveill,,416

Despite advances in understanding acute gastrointestinal infections, important issues concerning epidemiology, diagnosis, treatment and control of most persistent digestive symptomatologies remain to be elucidated. Helminths and intestinal protozoa are considered to play major roles, but the full extent of the aetiologic spectrum is still unclear. We provide an overview of pathogens causing digestive disorders in the tropics and evaluate available reference tests. METHODS: We searched the literature to identify pathogens that might give rise to persistent diarrhoea, chronic abdominal pain and/or blood in the stool. We reviewed existing laboratory diagnostic methods for each pathogen and stratified them by (i) microscopy; (ii) culture techniques; (iii) immunological tests; and (iv) molecular methods. Pathogen-specific reference tests providing highest diagnostic accuracy are described in greater detail. RESULTS: Over 30 pathogens may cause persistent digestive disorders. Bacteria, viruses and parasites are important aetiologic agents of acute and long-lasting symptomatologies. An integrated approach, consisting of stool culture, microscopy and/or specific immunological techniques for toxin, antigen and antibody detection, is required for accurate diagnosis of bacteria and parasites. Molecular techniques are essential for sensitive diagnosis of many viruses, bacteria and intestinal protozoa, and are increasingly utilised as adjuncts for helminth identification. CONCLUSIONS: Diagnosis of the broad spectrum of intestinal pathogens is often cumbersome. There is a need for rapid diagnostic tests that are simple and affordable for resource-constrained settings, so that the management of patients suffering from persistent digestive disorders can be improved.","Becker, Sören L; Vogt, Jürg; Knopp, Stefanie; Panning, Marcus; Warhurst, David C; Polman, Katja; Marti, Hanspeter; von Müller, Lutz; Yansouni, Cedric P; Jacobs, Jan; Bottieau, Emmanuel; Sacko, Moussa; Rijal, Suman; Meyanti, Fransiska; Miles, Michael A; Boelaert, Marleen; Lutumba, Pascal; van Lieshout, Lisette; N’Goran, Eliézer K; Chappuis, François; Utzinger, Jürg",BMC Infect Dis,https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2334-13-37; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23347408/,416

Herein, we report an eco-friendly and efficient electrochemical strategy for inactivating the SARS-CoV-2 using in-situ formed nickel oxide hydroxide as anode catalyst and sodium carbonate as electrolyte. At a voltage of 5 V, the SARS-CoV-2 viruses can be rapidly inactivated with disinfection efficiency reaching 95% in only 30 s and 99.99% in 5 min. Mass spectrometry analysis and theoretical calculations indicate that the reactive oxygen species generated on the anode can oxidize the peptide chains and induce cleavage of the peptide backbone of the receptor binding domain of the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein, and thereby disables the virus. This strategy provides a sustainable and highly efficient approach for the disinfection of the SARS-CoV-2 viruliferous aerosols and wastewater.","Tu, Yunchuan; Tang, Wei; Yu, Liang; Liu, Zheyi; Liu, Yanting; Xia, Huicong; Zhang, Haiwei; Chen, Shiyun; Wu, Jia; Cui, Xiaoju; Zhang, Jianan; Wang, Fangjun; Hu, Yangbo; Deng, Dehui",Sci Bull (Beijing),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33520336/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2095927320307702; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2095927320307702; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scib.2020.12.025,416

598280,Impact of COVID-19 prevention measures on Clostridioides difficile infections in a regional acute care hospital,2021-08-26,"COVID-19 poses an immense and immediate threat to global public health. Population level interventions (PLIs) impact this threat, with estimable large effects on reducing mortality. Many countries worldwide have currently zero/low mortality and many have yet to implement such PLIs. The importance of timing of PLI implementation on mortality outcomes is poorly understood. We extracted cumulative country-specific COVID-19 mortality for France, Germany, Italy, Spain and the UK to examine country-specific mortality trends and found that all five countries experienced COVID-19 mortality epidemics initially of exponential nature. We estimated the magnitude of effect on mortality of the nationwide PLI implemented on day 18 of Italy's mortality epidemic and assessed the importance of timing of PLI implementation by computing the effect of implementation of a PLI of this magnitude at various times on subsequent mortality. The nationwide PLI in Italy saved an estimated 6,170 lives by day 30 of the Italian epidemic. Implementing a PLI with this effect magnitude in a country of 60 million people on the day of the first death, and on days 7, 10, 14 and 17 thereafter, compared to implementation on day 18, resulted in substantially greater numbers of lives saved. Implementation on day 1 resulted in an additional 3,477 lives saved, 6,955 intensive care unit admissions and 52,162 hospital admissions prevented, beyond that achieved by implementation on day 18. PLI implementation earlier than day 18 substantially enhances benefit.

In response to this need, researchers have developed participatory surveillance technologies that allow individuals to report emerging symptoms daily so that their data can be extrapolated and disseminated to local health care authorities. OBJECTIVE: This study uses a framework synthesis to evaluate existing self-reported symptom tracking programs in the United States for COVID-19 as an early-warning tool for probable clusters of infection. This in turn will inform decision makers and health care planners about these technologies and the usefulness of their information to aid in federal, state, and local efforts to mobilize effective current and future pandemic responses. METHODS: Programs were identified through keyword searches and snowball sampling, then screened for inclusion. A best fit framework was constructed for all programs that met the inclusion criteria by collating information collected from each into a table for easy comparison. RESULTS: We screened 8 programs; 6 were included in our final framework synthesis. We identified multiple common data elements, including demographic information like race, age, gender, and affiliation (all were associated with universities, medical schools, or schools of public health). Dissimilarities included collection of data regarding smoking status, mental well-being, and suspected exposure to COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: Several programs currently exist that track COVID-19 symptoms from participants on a semiregular basis. Coordination between symptom tracking program research teams and local and state authorities is currently lacking, presenting an opportunity for collaboration to avoid duplication of efforts and more comprehensive knowledge dissemination.","Koehlmoos, Tracey Pérez; Janvrin, Miranda Lynn; Korona-Bailey, Jessica; Madsen, Cathaleen; Sturdivant, Rodney",J Med Internet Res,https://doi.org/10.2196/23297; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33006943/,416
599949,Sex- and age-specific clinical and immunological features of coronavirus disease 2019,2021-03-26,"Declared a global pandemic in March 2020, COVID-19 is unequivocally changing individuals' daily lives. Research suggests that for many people, the current pandemic is stressogenic, propelling myriads of disturbing affective experiences resulting in greater symptoms of depression and anxiety. Little is known, however, about how this ecologically grounded stress is experienced and managed within people's romantic relationships. Guided by the systemic transactional model of dyadic coping, the current study tested 4 preregistered hypotheses examining the effects of dyadic coping processes on partners' daily mood and relational outcomes near to the outbreak of COVID-19 (During May 2020). Using daily diary data collected from 72 Israeli couples over 21 days, the results showed COVID-related stress to be associated with lower daily positive, and higher daily negative, mood. Stress communication (i.e., disclosing stress to one's partner) was not associated with mood or relational outcomes; however, perceived positive and negative forms of dyadic coping (perceived partner's constructive and destructive behaviors in response to one's stress) were associated with poorer daily relational outcomes. Negative dyadic coping also exacerbated the effect of stress on one's negative mood. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to examine the effects of daily dyadic coping and COVID-related stress on people's affective and relational outcomes. The findings may shed light on the ways in which partners can help each other to adaptively cope with global health crises.

This paper explores how threats and risks are anticipated and acted on in biobanking, which builds research repositories for biomedical samples and data. Focusing on the biggest harmonisation cluster of biomedical research in Europe, BBMRI-ERIC, the paper analyses different logics of risk in the anticipatory discourse on biobanking. Based on document analysis, interviews with ELSI experts, and field research, three types of framing of risk are reconstructed: data security, privacy, and data misuse. The paper finds that these logics downplay the broader social and political context and reflects on the limits of the practices of anticipatory governance in biobanking. It argues that this regime of governance can make it difficult for biobanks to address possible future challenges, such as access to biomedical data by authorities, pressures for integrating biobank data with other type of personal data, or their use for profiling beyond medical purposes. To address potential controversies and societal implications related to the use of big data in health research and medicine, the paper suggests to expand the vocabulary and practices of anticipatory governance, in the biobanking community and beyond.","Rychnovská, Dagmar",Sci Eng Ethics,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11948-021-00305-w; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33881646/,416

Antibiotics of the complestatin–kistamycin group have a structural motif similar to that of the peptide core of antibacterial antibiotics of the vancomycin–teicoplanin group though no amino acid component in the chloropeptin–kistamicin antibiotics is identical to an amino acid incorporated in the peptide core of the antibiotics of the vancomycin–teicoplanin group. Chloropeptins and the hydrophobic several derivatives of antibacterial antibiotics are inhibitors of HIV and some other viruses. They interfere with the viral (i.e. HIV) entry process. Chemical modifications of natural glycopeptide antibiotics led to the compounds with antiviral properties whereas antibacterial properties were lost.

We investigated whether hydroxychloroquine could prevent SARS-CoV-2 in healthcare workers at high risk of exposure. METHODS: We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial of healthcare workers with ongoing exposure to persons with SARS-CoV-2, including those working in emergency departments, intensive care units, Covid-19 hospital wards, and first responders. Participants across the United States and in the Canadian province of Manitoba were randomized to hydroxychloroquine 400mg once weekly or twice weekly for 12 weeks. The primary endpoint was confirmed or probable Covid-19-compatible illness. We measured hydroxychloroquine whole blood concentrations. RESULTS: We enrolled 1483 healthcare workers, of which 79% reported performing aerosol-generating procedures. The incidence of Covid-19 (laboratory-confirmed or symptomatic compatible illness) was 0.27 events per person-year with once-weekly and 0.28 events per person-year with twice-weekly hydroxychloroquine compared with 0.38 events per person-year with placebo. For once weekly hydroxychloroquine prophylaxis, the hazard ratio was 0.72 (95%CI 0.44 to 1.16; P=0.18), and for twice-weekly was 0.74 (95%CI 0.46 to 1.19; P=0.22) as compared with placebo. Median hydroxychloroquine concentrations in whole blood were 98 ng/mL (IQR, 82-120) with once-weekly and 200 ng/mL (IQR, 159-258) with twice-weekly dosing. Hydroxychloroquine concentrations did not differ between participants who developed Covid-19-compatible illness (154 ng/mL) versus participants without Covid-19 (133 ng/mL; P=0.08). CONCLUSIONS: Pre-exposure prophylaxis with hydroxychloroquine once or twice weekly did not significantly reduce laboratory-confirmed Covid-19 or Covid-19-compatible illness among healthcare workers.","Rajasingham, Radha; Bangdiwala, Ananta S; Nicol, Melanie R; Skipper, Caleb P; Pastick, Katelyn A; Axelrod, Margaret L; Pullen, Matthew F; Nascene, Alanna A; Williams, Darlisha A; Engen, Nicole W; Okafor, Elizabeth C; Rini, Brian I; Mayer, Ingrid A; McDonald, Emily G; Lee, Todd C; Li, Peter; MacKenzie, Lauren J; Balko, Justin M; Dunlop, Stephen J; Hullsiek, Katherine H; Boulware, David R; Lofgren, Sarah M",Clin Infect Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33068425/; https://doi.org/10.1093/cid/ciaa1571,416

We aimed to evaluate the intervention, including differences between them and observers. The intervention was organized for sixth-year medical students at a Polish medical university. The study protocol assumed a pre-post analysis of students’ attitudes and self-efficacy of communication skills and their opinions about the intervention. Complete questionnaire pairs were returned by 126 students. The pre-post analysis revealed a significant improvement in their self-efficacy levels of almost all skills as well as their affective attitudes and belief in outcomes of communication learning. The improvement was significant among both the active participants and observers. It also showed a decrease in the motivation score, significant only in females. Regardless of their roles, students had positive opinions about the course and its particular aspects. The modified GOSCE may be an enjoyable and effective learning experience for students, especially in the light of limited resources.

However, it has been reported that intakes of some vitamins do not meet the nutrition reference values even in high-income countries. In this case, vitamin-fortified foods and/or vitamin supplements are helpful to fix insufficient/deficient status. However, it is not clear whether consumers are aware of their nutritional status or whether they use these products efficiently. To address this issue, we conducted an online cross-sectional questionnaire survey among 14,741 Japanese adults (over 20 years old, 7489 males and 7252 females) concerning the perceptions and prevalence of vitamin-fortified food and/or vitamin supplements. Differences in distribution among groups were compared using the chi-squared test. According to dietary habits, 33.2% of the participants consumed a well-balanced diet every day, but 25.5% could not because of time (41.6%) or money (36.9%) constraints. The perception of each vitamin varied: the highest was for vitamin C (93.2%) and the lowest was for biotin (41.9%). In addition, only a portion of the participants believed that they took sufficient amounts of each vitamin; the highest was vitamin C (22.3%) and the lowest was biotin (5.2%). Despite this situation, most did not use vitamin-fortified food and/or vitamin supplements due to economic reasons. Among vitamin-fortified food and/or vitamin supplement users, the purposes for the usage of these products were varied, such as maintaining health (80.5%), supplementation of nutrients (47.8%), beauty-related purposes (27.5%), and to prevent infectious disease (23.2%).

The clinical specificity was assessed on 215 prepandemic sera (including some from patients with viral infections or autoimmune disorders). The clinical sensitivity was evaluated on 710 sera from 564 patients whose SARS-CoV-2 infection was confirmed by quantitative reverse transcription-PCR (qRT-PCR) and whose antibody response was compared to that measured by five other commercial tests. The kinetics of the antibody response were also analyzed in seven symptomatic patients. The specificity of the test (BioS) on prepandemic specimens was 98.1% (95% confidence interval [CI], 96.2% to 99.4%). When tested on the 710 pandemic specimens, BioS showed an overall clinical sensitivity of 86.0% (95% CI, 0.83 to 0.89), with good concordance with the Euroimmun assay (overall concordance of 0.91; Cohen’s kappa coefficient of 0.62). Due in part to simultaneous detection of IgM and IgG for both S1 and N proteins, BioS exhibited the highest positive percent agreement at ≥11 days post-symptom onset (PSO). In conclusion, the BioS IgM/IgG rapid test was highly specific and demonstrated a higher positive percentage of agreement than all the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay/chemiluminescence immunoassay (ELISA/CLIA) commercial tests considered in this study. Moreover, by detecting the presence of antibodies prior to 11 days PSO in 78.2% of the patients, the BioS test increased the efficiency of the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the early stages of the disease.","Plebani, Mario; Parčina, Marijo; Bechri, Issam; Zehender, Gianguglielmo; Terkeš, Vedrana; Abdel Hafith, Balqis; Antinori, Spinello; Pillet, Sylvie; Gonzalo, Sylvie; Hoerauf, Achim; Lai, Alessia; Morović, Miro; Bourlet, Thomas; Torre, Alessandro; Pozzetto, Bruno; Galli, Massimo",J Clin Microbiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33218990/; https://doi.org/10.1128/jcm.02240-20,416

HCoVs have large genomes that encode a fixed array of structural and nonstructural components, as well as a variety of accessory proteins that differ in number and sequence even among closely related CoVs. Thus, in addition to recombination and mutation, HCoV genomes evolve through gene gains and losses. In this review we summarize recent findings on the molecular evolution of HCoV genomes, with special attention to recombination and adaptive events that generated new viral species and contributed to host shifts and to HCoV emergence.

However, performance concerns have emerged recently, notably regarding sensitivity. We hypothesized that the clinical, biological, and radiological characteristics of patients with a false-negative first RT-PCR test and a final diagnosis of COVID-19 might differ from those of patients with a positive first RT-PCR test. We conducted a multicenter matched case–control study in COVID-19 patients. Patients with a negative first RT-PCR test were matched to patients with a positive first RT-PCR test on age, sex, and initial admission unit (ward or intensive care). We included 80 cases and 80 controls between March 30, and June 22, 2020. Neither mortality at hospital discharge nor hospital stay length differed between the two groups (P = 0.80 and P = 0.54, respectively). By multivariate analysis, two factors were independently associated with a lower risk of a first false-negative test, namely, headache (adjusted OR [aOR], 0.07; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 0.01–0.49]; P = 0.007) and fatigue/malaise (aOR, 0.16; 95% CI, 0.03–0.81; P = 0.027); two other factors were independently associated with a higher risk of a first false-negative test, namely, platelets > 207·10(3) mm(−3) (aOR, 3.81; 95% CI, 1.10–13.16]; P = 0.034) and C-reactive protein > 79.8 mg·L(−1) (aOR, 4.00; 95% CI, 1.21–13.19; P = 0.023). Patients with suspected COVID-19 whose laboratory tests indicating marked inflammation were at higher risk of a first false-negative RT-PCR test. Strategies involving serial RT-PCR testing must be rigorously evaluated.","Lascarrou, Jean-Baptiste; Colin, Gwenhael; Le Thuaut, Aurélie; Serck, Nicolas; Ohana, Mickael; Sauneuf, Bertrand; Geri, Guillaume; Mesland, Jean-Baptiste; Ribeyre, Gaetane; Hussenet, Claire; Boureau, Anne Sophie; Gille, Thomas",Sci Rep,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-82192-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33504923/,416

METHODS: Our article comprehensively searched PubMed, FMRS, EMbase, CNKI, WanFang databases, and VIP databases to collect literatures about the CT imaging features of COVID‐19 from 1 January to 16 March 2020. Three reviewers independently screened literature, extracted data, and assessed the risk of bias of included studies, and then, this meta‐analysis was performed by using Stata12.0 software. RESULTS: A total of 34 retrospective studies involving a total of 4121 patients with COVID‐19 were included. The results of the meta‐analysis showed that most patients presented bilateral lung involvement (73.8%, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 65.9%‐81.1%) or multilobar involvement (67.3%, 95% CI: 54.8%‐78.7%) and just little patients showed normal CT findings (8.4%). We found that the most common changes in lesion density were ground‐glass opacities (68.1%, 95% CI: 56.9%‐78.2%). Other changes in density included air bronchogram sign (44.7%), crazy‐paving pattern (35.6%), and consolidation (32.0%). Patchy (40.3%), spider web sign (39.5%), cord‐like (36.8%), and nodular (20.5%) were common lesion shapes in patients with COVID‐19. Pleural thickening (27.1%) was found in some patients. Lymphadenopathy (5.4%) and pleural effusion (5.3%) were rare. CONCLUSION: The lung lesions of patients with COVID‐19 were mostly bilateral lungs or multilobar involved.

611851,Acute haemorrhagic oedema of infancy as a manifestation of COVID-19,2021-03-29,"BACKGROUND: Point-of-care arterial blood gas (ABG) is a blood measurement test and a useful diagnostic tool that assists with treatment and therefore improves clinical outcomes. However, numerically reported test results make rapid interpretation difficult or open to interpretation. The arterial blood gas algorithm (ABG-a) is a new digital diagnostics solution that can provide clinicians with real-time interpretation of preliminary data on safety features, oxygenation, acid-base disturbances and renal profile. The main aim of this study was to clinically validate the algorithm against senior experienced clinicians, for acid-base interpretation, in a clinical context. METHODS: We conducted a prospective international multicentre observational cross-sectional study. 346 sample sets and 64 inpatients eligible for ABG met strict sampling criteria. Agreement was evaluated using Cohen’s kappa index, diagnostic accuracy was evaluated with sensitivity, specificity, efficiency or global accuracy and positive predictive values (PPV) and negative predictive values (NPV) for the prevalence in the study population. RESULTS: The concordance rates between the interpretations of the clinicians and the ABG-a for acid-base disorders were an observed global agreement of 84,3% with a Cohen’s kappa coefficient 0.81; 95% CI 0.77 to 0.86; p < 0.001. For detecting accuracy normal acid-base status the algorithm has a sensitivity of 90.0% (95% CI 79.9 to 95.3), a specificity 97.2% (95% CI 94.5 to 98.6) and a global accuracy of 95.9% (95% CI 93.3 to 97.6). For the four simple acid-base disorders, respiratory alkalosis: sensitivity of 91.2 (77.0 to 97.0), a specificity 100.0 (98.8 to 100.0) and global accuracy of 99.1 (97.5 to 99.7); respiratory acidosis: sensitivity of 61.1 (38.6 to 79.7), a specificity of 100.0 (98.8 to 100.0) and global accuracy of 98.0 (95.9 to 99.0); metabolic acidosis: sensitivity of 75.8 (59.0 to 87.2), a specificity of 99.7 (98.2 to 99.9) and a global accuracy of 97.4 (95.1 to 98.6); metabolic alkalosis sensitivity of 72.2 (56.0 to 84.2), a specificity of 95.5 (92.5 to 97.3) and a global accuracy of 93.0 (88.8 to 95.3); the four complex acid-base disorders, respiratory and metabolic alkalosis, respiratory and metabolic acidosis, respiratory alkalosis and metabolic acidosis, respiratory acidosis and metabolic alkalosis, the sensitivity, specificity and global accuracy was also high. For normal acid-base status the algorithm has PPV 87.1 (95% CI 76.6 to 93.3) %, and NPV 97.9 (95% CI 95.4 to 99.0) for a prevalence of 17.4 (95% CI 13.8 to 21.8). For the four-simple acid-base disorders and the four complex acid-base disorders the PPV and NPV were also statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS: The ABG-a showed very high agreement and diagnostic accuracy with experienced senior clinicians in the acid-base disorders in a clinical context. The method also provides refinement and deep complex analysis at the point-of-care that a clinician could have at the bedside on a day-to-day basis. The ABG-a method could also have the potential to reduce human errors by checking for imminent life-threatening situations, analysing the internal consistency of the results, the oxygenation and renal status of the patient.","Rodríguez-Villar, Sancho; Poza-Hernández, Paloma; Freigang, Sascha; Zubizarreta-Ormazabal, Idoia; Paz-Martín, Daniel; Holl, Etienne; Pérez-Pardo, Osvaldo Ceferino; Tovar-Doncel, María Sherezade; Wissa, Sonja Maria; Cimadevilla-Calvo, Bonifacio; Tejón-Pérez, Guillermo; Moreno-Fernández, Ismael; Escario-Méndez, Alejandro; Arévalo-Serrano, Juan; Valentín, Antonio; Do-Vale, Bruno Manuel; Fletcher, Helen Marie; Lorenzo- Fernández, Jesús Medardo",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33690724/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0248264,416

A retrospective, medical records-based cohort study was conducted in March to May 2020 in a Swedish district hospital. All adult patients with severe COVID-19, those who received oxygen in the ward and had no ICU-admission during their hospital stay, were included. Data were collected on the oxygen flow-rates provided to the patients throughout their stay in hospital, and summary measures of oxygen provision calculated. One-hundred and twenty six patients were included. Their median age was 70 years and 43% were female. On admission, 27% had a peripheral oxygen saturation of <=91% and 54% had a respiratory rate of >=25/min. The mean oxygen flow-rate to patients while receiving oxygen therapy was 3.0 l/min (SD 2.9) and the mean total volume of oxygen provided per patient admission was 16,000 l (SD 23,000). In conclusion, the provision of oxygen to severely ill COVID-19-patients was lower than previously estimated. Further research is required before global estimates are adjusted.","Hvarfner, A.; Al-Djaber, A.; Ekstrom, H.; Enarsson, M.; Castegren, M.; Baker, T.; Schell, C.

Globally, it has affected 40,373,228 individuals and resulted in 1,119,568 deaths as of October 19, 2020. Research studies have demonstrated that geriatric population is vastly vulnerable to COVID-19 morbidity and mortality given their age and preexisting chronic comorbidities such as cardiovascular disease, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, chronic pulmonary and chronic kidney disease The data regarding susceptibility of elderly population to COVID-19 is accruing and suggests that factors like age, gender, chronic comorbidity, inflammaging, immunosenescence and renin angiotensin system may be the contributing risk factors towards COVID-19 and associated mortality in elderly population. Based on updated scientific literature, this narrative review précises the clinical presentations and underlying risk factors that might be associated with COVID-19 morbidity in geriatric population and provides informed insights, and discusses clinical presentation, psychosocial impact, mortality and potential corticosteroid treatment and prevention strategies of COVID-19 in older adults.","Mohamad Al-Zahrani, Jamaan",Saudi J Biol Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33169063/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1319562X20305635; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.sjbs.2020.11.001; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1319562X20305635?v=s5,416

DESIGN: Data of 39 208 Brazilian adults from a Behaviour Web Survey were used. Unhealthy nutrition habits were eating fruits or vegetables for <5 d/week and ultra-processed food (sugary foods, snacks, ready-to-eat frozen foods and embedded foods) for ≥5 d/week. For incidence indicators, we only considered participants without unhealthy behaviour before the quarantine. We created four categories of change in TV-viewing and computer/tablet use, considering a cut-off point of 4 h/d for each behaviour (1 – consistently low, 2 – become low during the quarantine, 3 – become high during the quarantine or 4 – consistently high). Analyses were adjusted for sex, age group, highest academic achievement, per capita income, working status during the quarantine, skin colour and adherence to the quarantine. SETTING: Brazil. PARTICIPANTS: Brazilian adults (nationally representative). RESULTS: Logistic regression models revealed that high TV-viewing and computer/tablet use incidence were associated with higher odds for elevated frequency of ultra-processed food consumption (TV-viewing: OR 1·70; 95 % CI 1·37, 2·12; computer/tablet: OR 1·73; 95 % CI 1·31, 2·27) and low consumption of fruit and vegetables (TV-viewing: OR 1·70; 95 % CI 1·29, 2·23; computer/tablet: OR 1·53; 95 % CI 1·08, 2·17) incidence. Consistent high computer/tablet use also presented higher odds for incidence of elevated frequency of ultra-processed food consumption. CONCLUSIONS: Participants with incidence of sedentary behaviours were also more likely to present incidence of unhealthy diet during the COVID-19 pandemic quarantine.","Werneck, André O; Silva, Danilo R; Malta, Deborah C; Gomes, Crizian Saar; Souza-Júnior, Paulo RB; Azevedo, Luiz O; Barros, Marilisa BA; Szwarcwald, Célia L",Public health nutrition,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33087204/; https://doi.org/10.1017/s1368980020004188,416

We aimed to describe the clinical characteristics of non-survivors with COVID-19. Methods For this retrospective, single-center study, we included 36 non-survivors with COVID-19 in the Fifth Hospital of Wuhan. Cases were confirmed by real-time RT-PCR between Jan 21 and Feb 10, 2020 according to the recommended protocol. The epidemiological, demographic, clinical, laboratory, radiological and treatment data were collected and analyzed. Outcomes were followed up until Feb 14, 2020. This study was approved by the ethics commissions of the Fifth Hospital of Wuhan, with a waiver of informed consent due to a public health outbreak investigation. Results We included 36 patients who died from COVID-19. The mean age of the patients was 69.22 years (SD 9.64, range 50-90). 25(69.44%) patients were males, and 11 (30.56%) female. 26 (72.22%) patients had chronic diseases, mainly including hypertension, cardiovascular disease and diabetes. Patients had common clinical symptoms of fever (34 [94.44%] patients), cough (28 [77.78%] patients), shortness of breath (21 [58.33%] patients), and fatigue (17 [47.22%] patient). Chest computed tomographic scans showed that 31 (96.88%) patients had bilateral pneumonia. Lymphopenia occurred in 24 patients (70.59%), decreased albumin (30.18, [SD, 4.76]) in 25 patients (80.65%), elevated D-dimer (8.64 [IQR, 2.39-20]) in 27 patients (100%), and elevated lactate dehydrogenase (502.5 U/L [IQR, 410-629]) in 26 patients (100%). Nearly all of the patients have elevated CRP (106.3 mg/L [IQR, 60.83-225.3]), PCT (0.61 ng/ml [IQR, 0.16-2.10]) and IL-6 (100.6 pg/ml [IQR, 51.51-919.5]). Most patients received antiviral therapy and antibiotic therapy, and more than half of patients received glucocorticoid therapy (25 [69.44%]). All the patients had acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The median time from onset to ARDS was 11 days. One (2.78%) patient presented with acute renal injury. The median time from onset to death was 17 days. Interpretation Lots of patients died from COVID-19 till now. The median survival time of these non-survivors from onset to death was about 2 weeks. Most patients were older males with comorbidities. They finally progressed to ARDS. The median time from onset to ARDS was 11 days. Gradually decreased lymphocytes and increased inflammation biomarkers were common, and need to be monitored in the routine treatment.","Huang, Ying; Yang, Rui; Xu, Ying; Gong, Ping",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.27.20029009,416

617675,Myasthenia gravis and covid-19 in pregnancy: a review of the literature and case series report,2021,"The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic remains a global health issue for several reasons, such as the low vaccination rates and a lack of developed herd immunity to the evolution of SARS-CoV-2, as well as its potential inclination to elude neutralizing antibodies. It should be noted that the severity of the COVID-19 disease is significantly affected by the presence of co-infections. Comorbid conditions are caused not only by pathogenic and opportunistic microorganisms but also by some representatives of the environmental microbiome. The presence of patients with moderate and severe forms of the disease in hospitals indicates the need for epidemiological monitoring of (1) bacterial pathogens circulating in hospitals, especially the ESKAPE group pathogens, and (2) the microbiome of various surfaces in hospitals. In our study, we used combined methods based on PCR and NGS sequencing, which are widely used for epidemiological monitoring. Through this approach, we identified the DNA of pathogenic bacteria (Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, CoNS, and Achromobacter spp.) on various surfaces. We also estimated the microbiome diversity of surfaces and identified the potential reservoirs of infections using 16S rRNA profiling. Although we did not assess the viability of identified microorganisms, our results indicate the possible risks of insufficient regular disinfection of surfaces, regardless of department, at the Infectious Diseases Hospital. Controlling the transmission of nosocomial diseases is critical to the successful treatment of COVID-19 patients, the rational use of antimicrobial drugs, and timely decontamination measures.","Pochtovyi, Andrei A.; Vasina, Daria V.; Kustova, Daria D.; Divisenko, Elizaveta V.; Kuznetsova, Nadezhda A.; Burgasova, Olga A.; Kolobukhina, Ludmila V.; Tkachuk, Artem P.; Gushchin, Vladimir A.; Gintsburg, Alexander L.",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18179042; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34501634/,416

Research Design and Methods. We analyzed data from 489,769 adults enrolled in the UK Biobank—a population-based cohort study. The exposures of interest are BMI categories and central obesity (e.g., larger waist circumference). Using genome-wide genotyping data, we also computed polygenic risk scores (PRSs) that represent an individual's overall genetic risk for each obesity trait. The outcome was severe COVID-19, defined by hospitalization for laboratory-confirmed COVID-19. RESULTS: Of 489,769 individuals, 33% were normal weight (BMI, 18.5–24.9 kg/m(2)), 43% overweight (25.0–29.9 kg/m(2)), and 24% obese (≥30.0 kg/m(2)). The UK Biobank identified 641 patients with severe COVID-19. Compared to adults with normal weight, those with a higher BMI had a dose-response increases in the risk of severe COVID-19, with the following adjusted ORs: for 25.0–29.9 kg/m(2), 1.40 (95%CI 1.14–1.73; P = 0.002); for 30.0–34.9 kg/m(2), 1.73 (95%CI 1.36–2.20; P < 0.001); for 35.0–39.9 kg/m(2), 2.82 (95%CI 2.08–3.83; P < 0.001); and for ≥40.0 kg/m(2), 3.30 (95%CI 2.17–5.03; P < 0.001). Likewise, central obesity was associated with significantly higher risk of severe COVID-19 (P < 0.001). Furthermore, larger PRS for BMI was associated with higher risk of outcome (adjusted OR per BMI PRS Z-score 1.14, 95%CI 1.05–1.24; P = 0.004). CONCLUSIONS: In this large population-based cohort, individuals with more-severe obesity, central obesity, or genetic predisposition for obesity are at higher risk of developing severe-COVID-19.","Zhu, Zhaozhong; Hasegawa, Kohei; Ma, Baoshan; Fujiogi, Michimasa; Camargo, Carlos A.; Liang, Liming",Metabolism,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0026049520302092?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.metabol.2020.154345; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0026049520302092; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32835759/,416

The two aims of this work were to assess the performances of SOFIA(®)RSV tests in “real-life-laboratory” conditions (study 1) and implemented at point-of-care testing in a pediatric emergency department (ED, study 2), during two consecutive winter seasons. METHODS: In study 1, fresh nasopharyngeal swabs from patients of all ages were sampled in 1.5 ml of Universal virological Transport Medium (UTM) and prospectively tested using SOFIA(®)RSV tests. In study 2, conducted in a pediatric ED, nasopharyngeal swabs were placed in 3 ml of UTM. All SOFIA(®)RSV tests were confirmed by molecular testing, considered as reference method. The epidemiological and clinical features of tested patients, as well as the care of these patients after obtaining quick results were evaluated. RESULTS: The sensitivities of SOFIA(®)RSV in infants (aged under 24 months) performed in the laboratory and in the pediatric ED were respectively 95% (95% CI: 86.8–98.1) and 74.8% (95% CI: 68.0–80.9) compared to PCR. In study 1, the sensitivity among children (from 2 to 15 years old) and adults (above 15 years old) dropped to 45% (95% CI: 23.1–68.5) and 59% (95% CI: 32.9–81.6), respectively. In study 2, there were some differences in bed-management of SOFIA(®)RSV positive compared to SOFIA(®)RSV negative infants. CONCLUSIONS: SOFIA(®)RSV tests performed in the laboratory and in the pediatric ED show high and satisfactory sensitivities among young children under 24 months, which supports its robustness and reliability. However, the impact of these tests on patient care at point-of-care cannot be clearly assessed when considering the limits of the study 2 design.

The world convened in international efforts, experiences and technologies in order to fight the emerging pandemic. Isolation, hygiene measure, diagnosis, and treatment are the most efficient ways of prevention and intervention nowadays. The health organizations and global care systems screened the available resources and offered recommendations of approved and proposed medications.

Due to limited therapeutic options, there is a compelling need for new antiprotozoal agents. In a previous study, O-tigloylcyclovirobuxeine-B was recovered from a B. sempervirens L. (common box; Buxaceae) leaf extract by bioactivity-guided isolation. This nor-cycloartane alkaloid was identified as possessing strong and selective in vitro activity against the causative agent of malaria tropica, Plasmodium falciparum (Pf). The purpose of this study is the isolation of additional alkaloids from B. sempervirens L. to search for further related compounds with strong antiprotozoal activity. In conclusion, 25 alkaloids were obtained from B. sempervirens L., including eight new natural products and one compound first described for this plant. The structure elucidation was accomplished by UHPLC/+ESI-QqTOF-MS/MS and NMR spectroscopy. The isolated alkaloids were tested against Pf and Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense (Tbr), the causative agent of East African sleeping sickness. To assess their selectivity, cytotoxicity against mammalian cells (L6 cell line) was tested as well. Several of the compounds displayed promising in vitro activity against the pathogens in a sub-micromolar range with concurrent high selectivity indices (SI). Consequently, various alkaloids from B. sempervirens L. have the potential to serve as a novel antiprotozoal lead structure.","Szabó, Lara U.; Kaiser, Marcel; Mäser, Pascal; Schmidt, Thomas J.",Antibiotics (Basel),https://doi.org/10.3390/antibiotics10060696; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34200688/,416

627328,A Bibliometrics Analysis of Metformin Development From 1980 to 2019,2021-04-28,"BACKGROUND: Data on breakthrough SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant infections in vaccinated individuals are limited. METHODS: We studied breakthrough infections among Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccinated healthcare workers in an infectious diseases hospital in Vietnam. We collected demographic and clinical data alongside serial PCR testing, measurement of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, and viral whole-genome sequencing. FINDINGS: Between 11(th)–25(th) June 2021 (7-8 weeks after the second dose), 69 staff tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. 62 participated in the study. Most were asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic and all recovered. Twenty-two complete-genome sequences were obtained; all were Delta variant and were phylogenetically distinct from contemporary viruses obtained from the community or from hospital patients admitted prior to the outbreak. Viral loads inferred from Ct values were 251 times higher than in cases infected with the original strain in March/April 2020. Median time from diagnosis to negative PCR was 21 days (range 8–33). Neutralizing antibodies (expressed as percentage of inhibition) measured after the second vaccine dose, or at diagnosis, were lower in cases than in uninfected, fully vaccinated controls (median (IQR): 69.4 (50.7-89.1) vs. 91.3 (79.6-94.9), p=0.005 and 59.4 (32.5-73.1) vs. 91.1 (77.3-94.2), p=0.002). There was no correlation between vaccine-induced neutralizing antibody levels and peak viral loads or the development of symptoms. INTERPRETATION: Breakthrough Delta variant infections following Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccination may cause asymptomatic or mild disease, but are associated with high viral loads, prolonged PCR positivity and low levels of vaccine-induced neutralizing antibodies. Epidemiological and sequence data suggested ongoing transmission had occurred between fully vaccinated individuals.

629401,295 Complementary Medicine (CAM) Beliefs and Attitudes Towards COVID-19 in Inner-City Kidney Patients,2021-04-30,"In late 2019, a new Coronavirus disease, referred to as Corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19), emerged in Wuhan city, Hubei, China, and resulted in a global pandemic---claiming a large number of lives and affecting billions all around the world. The current global standard used in diagnosis of COVID-19 in suspected cases is the real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test. Although the RT-PCR remains the standard reference for diagnosis purposes, it is a time-consuming and expensive test, and moreover, it usually suffers from high rates of false-negatives. Several early works have reported that the sensitivity of the chest Computed Tomography (CT) and the chest X-ray imaging are noticeably greater than that of the RT-PCR test at the initial representations of the disease, making them great candidates for developing new and sophisticated methodologies for analysis and classification of COVID-19 cases. In this paper, we establish the use of a rapid, non-invasive and cost-effective X-ray-based method as a key diagnosis and screening tool for COVID-19 at early and intermediate stages of the disease. To this end, we develop a novel and sophisticated deep learning-based signal and image processing technique as well as classification methodology for analyzing X-ray images specific to COVID-19 disease. Specifically, we consider a semi-supervised learning methodology based on AutoEncoders to first extract the infected legions in chest X-ray manifestation of COVID-19 and other Pneumonia-like diseases (as well as healthy cases). Then, we utilize this highly-tailored deep architecture to extract the relevant features specific to each class (i.e., healthy, non-COVID pneumonia, and COVID-19) and train a powerful yet efficient classifier to perform the task of automatic diagnosis. Furthermore, the semi-supervised nature of the proposed framework enables us to efficiently exploit the limited available dataset on COVID-19 while exploiting the vast amount of available X-ray dataset for healthy and non-COVID classes. Moreover, such a semi-supervised approach does not require an expert-annotated lesion area for each class. Our numerical investigations demonstrate that the proposed framework outperforms the state-of-the-art methods for COVID-19 identification while employing approximately ten times fewer training parameters as compared to other existing methodologies for classification of the COVID-19 from X-ray images (facilitating efficient training in a limited data regime). We further develop explainable artificial intelligence tools that can explain the diagnosis by using attribution maps while providing an indispensable tool for the radiologist in triage state. We have made the codes of our proposed framework publicly available to the research and healthcare community.","Khobahi, Shahin; Agarwal, Chirag; Soltanalian, Mojtaba",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.14.20065722,416

Currently, there is no effective vaccine or drugs against the ASFV. How to effectively control the virus is challenging. In this study, we have analyzed all the publicly available ASFV genomes and demonstrated that there was a large genetic diversity of ASFV genomes. Interestingly, the genetic diversity was mainly caused by extensive genomic insertions and/or deletions (indels) instead of the point mutations. Further analyses showed that the indels may be attributed much to the homologous recombination, as supported by significant associations between the occurrence of extensive recombination events and the indels in the ASFV genomes. Besides, the homologous recombination also led to changes of gene content of ASFVs. Finally, repeated elements of dozens of nucleotides in length were observed to widely distribute and cluster in the adjacent positions of ASFV genomes, which may facilitate the occurrence of homologous recombination. This work highlighted the importance of homologous recombination in shaping the genetic diversity of the ASFVs, and could help understand the evolution of the virus.","Zhu, Zhaozhong; Xiao, Chao-Ting; Fan, Yunshi; Cai, Zena; Lu, Congyu; Zhang, Gaihua; Jiang, Taijiao; Tan, Yongjun; Peng, Yousong",Veterinary Microbiology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vetmic.2019.08.003; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31500735/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0378113519304183; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378113519304183,416

To examine the prevalence of CCoV infection among Vietnamese dogs, 201 serum samples were analyzed by virus-neutralization (VN) test. The results showed that antibody against CCoV-II was present in 87 dogs (43.3%). To detect genes of CCoV, fecal samples collected from 30 diarrheic and 50 healthy dogs were examinated by RT-PCR, confirming that 2 diarrheic dogs and 5 healthy dogs were positive for CCoV. Nucleotide sequences of N-terminal region of spike (S) gene indicated that CCoV strains were divided into two subgenotypes, CCoV-IIa and -IIb, respectively. Furthemore, we succeeded in isolating CCoV/dog/HCM47/2015, the isolate was plaque-purified three times, and 3’-terminal one-third of the genome was analyzed. Interestingly, the plaque-purified virus had a large deletion in ORF3abc and E genes (1,165 nt), and a short deletion in ORF7b gene (60 nt), suggesting that these regions are not necessary for in vitro replication of CCoV. Next, the antigenicity between the isolated CCoV-IIb and the other CCoV-IIa was compared by VN test, revealing that antigenicty of the isolated CCoV is equal or higher than that of the other CCoV. In summary, two subgenotypes of CCoV-II are spreading among Vietnamese dogs. The isolated virus with a large deletion after in vitro passage may be useful for the development of vaccine, owing to its antigenicity and efficient viral growth in vitro.","van NGUYEN, Dung; TERADA, Yukata; MINAMI, Shohei; YONEMITSU, Kenzo; NAGATA, Nao; LE, Thanh Dinh Ha; KUWATA, Ryusei; SHIMODA, Hiroshi; MAEDA, Ken",J Vet Med Sci,https://doi.org/10.1292/jvms.16-0538; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27840394/,416

Thus, we sought to determine the clinical roles of ACE2 (the cell entry receptor of SARS-CoV-2) in ccRCC (clear cell renal cell carcinoma). TCGA, GEO and TIP datasets, and immunohistochemistry and western blot results were used to determine the prognostic and clinicopathological characteristics of ACE2. ACE2 expression was down-regulated in ccRCC tissues and cell lines. The multivariate Cox regression analysis results indicated that increased ACE2 expression was independent predictor of longer OS (HR: 0.8259, 95%CI: 0.7734-0.8819, P<0.0001) and RFS (HR: 0.8023, 95%CI: 0.7375-0.8729, P<0.0001) in ccRCC patients. Lower ACE2 expression was also associated with advanced tumor stage, higher histological grade and pathological stage, and metastasis. Besides, ACE2 expression was significantly positively and negatively correlated with CD4 Naïve infiltration and CD4 Memory infiltration, respectively. Moreover, higher CD4 Naïve and lower CD4 Memory infiltration levels were associated with better pathological features and longer OS and RFS. Furthermore, high ACE2 expression group in decreased CD4 Naïve, enriched CD4 Naïve and enriched CD4 memory cohort had favorable prognosis. These findings identified that AEC2 was significantly reduced in ccRCC, and decreased ACE2 was related to worse pathological features and poor prognosis. Low ACE2 expression in ccRCC may partially affect the prognosis due to altered immune cells infiltration levels.","Yang, Wuping; Li, Lei; Zhang, Kenan; Ma, Kaifang; Xie, Haibiao; Gong, Yanqing; Zhou, Jingcheng; Gong, Kan",Int J Biol Sci,https://doi.org/10.7150/ijbs.51969; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33390830/,416

Targeting eight villages in Nam Et-Phou Louey (NEPL) National Park in northern Lao PDR, we draw on survey data with 255 households, 93 semi-structured interviews, and meso-level data on village conditions to examine how residents navigate associated livelihood dilemmas. A cluster analysis reveals five livelihood types with divergent capacities to engage in market development and cope with enforcement pressures. We show how market linkages, historical conservation interventions, and local access conditions shape livelihoods and differences between villages. Our approach yields a nuanced picture of how global conservation efforts result in an uneven distribution of costs and benefits at local scales.

Like the SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 also employs a receptor-binding motif (RBM) of its envelope spike protein for binding the host angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) to gain viral entry. Currently, extensive efforts are being made to produce vaccines against a surface fragment of a SARS-CoV-2, such as the spike protein, in order to boost protective antibody responses. It was previously unknown how spike protein-targeting antibodies would affect innate inflammatory responses to SARS-CoV-2 infections. Here we generated a highly purified recombinant protein corresponding to the RBM of SARS-CoV-2, and used it to screen for cross-reactive monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). We found two RBM-binding mAbs that competitively inhibited its interaction with human ACE2, and specifically blocked the RBM-induced GM-CSF secretion in both human monocyte and murine macrophage cultures. Our findings have suggested a possible strategy to prevent SARS-CoV-2-elicited “cytokine storm”, and provided a potentially useful criteria for future assessment of innate immune-modulating properties of various SARS-CoV-2 vaccines.","Qiang, Xiaoling; Zhu, Shu; Li, Jianhua; Wang, Ping; Tracey, Kevin J.; Wang, Haichao",bioRxiv,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32908979/; https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.09.04.280081,416
635423,Lives and Costs Saved by Expanding and Expediting COVID-19 Vaccination,2021-05-06,"PURPOSE: COVID-19 has spread rapidly worldwide since its initial appearance, creating the need for faster diagnostic methods and tools. Due to the high rate of false-negative RT-PCR tests, the role of chest CT examination has been investigated as an auxiliary procedure. The main goal of this work is to establish a well-defined strategy for 3D segmentation of the airways and lungs of COVID-19 positive patients from CT scans, including detected abnormalities. Their identification and the volumetric quantification could allow an easier classification in terms of gravity, extent and progression of the infection. Moreover, these 3D reconstructions can provide a high-impact tool to enhance awareness of the severity of COVID-19 pneumonia. METHODS: Segmentation process was performed utilizing a proprietary software, starting from six different stacks of chest CT images of subjects with and without COVID-19. In this context, a comparison between manual and automatic segmentation methods of the respiratory system was conducted, to assess the potential value of both techniques, in terms of time consumption, required anatomical knowledge and branch detection, in healthy and pathological conditions. RESULTS: High-quality 3D models were obtained. They can be utilized to assess the impact of the pathology, by volumetrically quantifying the extension of the affected areas. Indeed, based on the obtained reconstructions, an attempted classification for each patient in terms of the severity of the COVID-19 infection has been outlined. CONCLUSIONS: Automatic algorithms allowed for a substantial reduction in segmentation time. However, a great effort was required for the manual identification of COVID-19 CT manifestations. The developed automated procedure succeeded in obtaining sufficiently accurate models of the airways and the lungs of both healthy patients and subjects with confirmed COVID-19, in a reasonable time.","Bertolini, Michele; Brambilla, Alma; Dallasta, Samanta; Colombo, Giorgio",Int J Comput Assist Radiol Surg,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11548-021-02466-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34357524/,416

Abrupt onset shoulder pain, followed by motor weakness, paresthesia and hypoesthesia, is usually reported, lasting several months with variable recovery. The etiology of the disease may be idiopathic or triggered by an underlying autoimmune disease in genetically susceptible individuals. Our report addresses a unique case of Parsonage-Turner Syndrome in a patient suffering from concurrent Hashimoto Thyroiditis. A previously healthy A 22 year-old female was referred to the Department of Neurology after complaints of sudden-onset motor weakness in her left upper limb. On physical examination, the patient could not make an “Ok sign” with her thumb and distal phalanx or form a complete fist, revealing weakness within the anterior interosseous branch of the median nerve. Further testing with electromyography demonstrated muscular atrophy within the arm's anterior compartment, forearm, and triceps brachii of the posterior compartment. Additional imaging and physical examination were unremarkable, confirming our diagnosis of PTS. Furthermore, lab reports revealed elevated levels of anti-thyroglobulin and anti-thyroid peroxidase antibodies and our patient was concurrently diagnosed with Hashimoto's thyroiditis. This case aims to highlight the rare co-occurrence of Hashimoto's thyroiditis with Parsonage-Turner Syndrome in an otherwise healthy patient. A 2014 study published by Nugent et al. had also shed light on brachial neuritis in a patient suffering from autoimmune connective tissue disease, and through this case study, we hope to add to the growing literature regarding the correlation between PTS and autoimmune diseases.

Bien que la maladie affecte principalement le système respiratoire, des manifestations gastro-intestinales peuvent également survenir. Cependant, on sait peu de choses sur le développement de la pancréatite aiguë dans COVID-19. Méthode et résultat Nous rapportons une série de six patients atteints de COVID-19 présentant une pancréatite aiguë sans aucun autre facteur de risque ni alcoolisme, ni biliaire, dont deux ont présenté de la fièvre, une toux sèche, une dyspnée et des vomissements avec sensibilité épigastrique, le reste ont présenté une douleur épigastrique lancinante sévère irradiant dans le dos.

Discussion et conclusion La pancréatite virale a été bien décrite dans la littérature, le plus souvent à cause des oreillons, de la rougeole, de la coxsackie, du virus d’Epstein–Barr et du virus de l’hépatite A. Les coronavirus (CoV) sont une grande famille de virus à ARN simple brin, avec une infectivité chez l’homme et l’animal, provoquant plusieurs symptômes.

641457,"Clinical improvement, outcomes, antiviral activity, and costs associated with early treatment with remdesivir for patients with COVID-19",2021-07-15,"BACKGROUND: The outbreak of the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has led to a significant reduction in the number of patients treated in elective medicine in hospitals in spring 2020. Up until now, there are no corresponding data for university policlinics. MATERIAL AND METHODS: With the help of the data of the clinic’s electronic medical record system (IS-H/i.s.h.med from SAP, Cerner Corporation, North Kansas City, MO, United States of America and SAP SE, Walldorf, Germany) and the time recording and management software TimeElement (Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany), which was codeveloped at our clinic, all patient contacts of the COVID-19 shutdown were evaluated over a period of approximately 7 weeks from 18 March 2020 to 8 May 2020 and compared with the same period in 2019. In addition, quarterly revenues for the first and second quarters of 2019 and 2020 were put into perspective via SAP. RESULTS: During the COVID-19 period the total number of patient contacts was reduced by 59.5% compared to the previous year. The number of lockdown period cases decreased by 74.8% compared to the same period in 2019. In particular, the university outpatient/self-paying sector recorded the largest number of lost patient contacts with a reduction to 17.2% of the 2019 baseline. The reduced patient contacts and case numbers resulted in a significant financial loss of at least € 218,000. Via TimeElement there was a 69.4% decrease in all special diagnostic services, with visual field examinations in particular also reduced by 75.3%. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) measurements recorded a decrease of 60.3%. Patient tracking revealed a reduction of average patient attendance times by approximately 23% (COVID 19: 145.8 ± 88.8 min versus 189.6 ± 97.2 min in 2019). DISCUSSION: The COVID-19 shutdown caused the work performance of our policlinic to drop to only about 40% of patient contacts and that of functional diagnostic examinations to only about 30%, compared to the performance in 2019; however, the reduction in the number of patients also led to a significant reduction in the time patients were present at the clinic compared to the regular workload. The associated financial losses are considerable and obviously not compensated by legally regulated compensation payments as in the inpatient sector.","Framme, C.; Gottschling, J.; Buley, P.; Rohwer-Mensching, K.; Junker, B.; Dittberner, M.; Volkmann, I.",Ophthalmologe,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00347-021-01374-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33881590/,416

The S1 protein is thought to contain the serotype-specific neutralization epitopes and to be the main target of antigenic variation. An alignment with sequences of three strains published previously showed that from the 545 amino acid residues only 243 have been conserved. Clustering of substitutions suggests that most serotype determinants are located within the first 300 amino acid residues of S1. A phylogenetic tree of the S1 sequences showed very variable rates of divergence. Differences in topology with a tree based on RNAse-T1 fingerprint data indicate that some of the IBV strains have arisen by genetic recombination.","Kusters, J. G.; Niesters, H.G.M.; Lenstra, J.

We intend, with this systematic analysis and meta-analysis, to clarify the prevalence of the various strains of coronavirus in different animal species. For this purpose, we carried out an electronic survey using Pubmed's Veterinary Science search tool to conduct a systematic assessment of published studies reporting the prevalence of different strains of coronavirus in different animal species between 2015 and 2020. We conducted different analysis to assess sensitivity, publication bias, and heterogeneity, using random and fixed effects. The final meta-analysis included 42 studies for systematic review and 29 in the meta-analysis. For the geographic regions with a prevalence greater than or equal to 0.20 (Forest plot overall; prevalence = 0.20, p < 0.01, Q = 10476.22 and I2 = 100%), the most commonly detected viruses were: enteric coronavirus (ECoV), pigeon-dominant coronavirus, (PdCoV), Avian coronavirus M41, Avian coronavirus C46, Avian coronavirus A99, Avian coronavirus JMK, MERS-CoV, Bovine coronavirus, Ro-BatCoV GCCDC1, Alphacoronavirus, Betacoronavirus, Deltacoronavirus, Gamacoronavirus and human coronaviruses (HCoVs). The wide presence of different strains of coronavirus in different animal species on all continents demonstrates the great biodiversity and ubiquity of these viruses. The most recent epidemiological crises caused by coronavirus demonstrates our unpreparedness to anticipate and mitigate emerging risks, as well as the need to implement new epidemiological surveillance programs for viruses. Combined with the need to create advanced training courses in One Health, this is paramount in order to ensure greater effectiveness in fighting the next pandemics.","Faustino, R.; Faria, M.; Teixeira, M.; Palavra, F.; Costa, M.

Although the release of these technologies has great potential for generating health-related information, it is important to acknowledge the repercussions of consumer-targeted biometric monitoring technologies (BioMeTs), which in practice, are often used for medical decision making. BioMeTs are bodily connected digital medicine products that process data captured by mobile sensors that use algorithms to generate measures of behavioral and physiological function. These BioMeTs span both general wellness products and medical devices, and consumer-targeted BioMeTs intended for general wellness purposes are not required to undergo a standardized and transparent evaluation process for ensuring their quality and accuracy. The combination of product functionality, marketing, and the circumstances of the global SARS-CoV-2 pandemic have inevitably led to the use of consumer-targeted BioMeTs for reporting health-related measurements to drive medical decision making. In this viewpoint, we urge consumer-targeted BioMeT manufacturers to go beyond the bare minimum requirements described in US Food and Drug Administration guidance when releasing information on wellness BioMeTs. We also explore new methods and incentive systems that may result in a clearer public understanding of the performance and intended use of consumer-targeted BioMeTs.","Bent, Brinnae; Dunn, Jessilyn P",JMIR Mhealth Uhealth,https://doi.org/10.2196/25137; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33315580/,416

By limited protease digestion we defined a monomeric C-terminal domain of P that can bind to N-RNA. The atomic structure of this domain was determined and previously described mutations that interfere with binding of P to N-RNA could now be interpreted. There appears to be two features involved in this activity situated at opposite surfaces of the molecule: a positively charged patch and a hydrophobic pocket with an exposed tryptophan side-chain. Other previously published work suggests a conformational change in P when it binds to N-RNA, which may imply the repositioning of two helices that would expose a hydrophobic groove for interaction with N. This domain of rabies virus P is structurally unrelated to the N-RNA binding domains of the phosphoproteins of Sendai and measles virus that are members of the same order of viruses, the non-segmented negative strand RNA viruses. The implications of this finding for the evolution of this virus group are discussed.","Mavrakis, Manos; McCarthy, Andrew A.; Roche, Stéphane; Blondel, Danielle; Ruigrok, Rob W.H.",Journal of Molecular Biology,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S002228360401071X; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15476803/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S002228360401071X,416

En août 2020, le retour d’expérience de la 1ere vague nous a conduit à l’acquisition d’appareils d’oxygénothérapie haut débit (OHD) pour certains services non habitués à leur usage comme celui des maladies infectieuses (MI). Dans ce contexte, la pratique de l’OHD en service d’hospitalisation conventionnelle (HC) s’est imposée comme alternative dans la prise en charge des patients ayant une pneumopathie grave à SARS-CoV-2 en attente de lit ou récusés de réanimation. Matériels et méthodes Nous présentons une analyse descriptive rétrospective de 32 patients qui ont bénéficié d’une OHD dans le cadre d’une aggravation de leur pneumopathie hypoxémiante à SARS-CoV-2 dans le service de MI d’un centre hospitalier général entre le 20/08/2020 et 15/02/2021. L’objectif de cette étude était d’étudier la mortalité en HC des patients ayant bénéficié d’OHD. Résultats Des 32 patients mis sous OHD en HC, 18 (56 %) étaient éligibles à la réanimation. Treize sur 18 (72,2%) ont pu être transférés en réanimation dans un délai de 24h après la mise en place de l’OHD (3jours pour une patiente). Cinq (27,8 %) patients sont restés en HC avec une durée moyenne d’OHD de 3jours et une durée moyenne d’hospitalisation de 12jours. Il n’y a pas eu de décès chez ces patients. Quatorze patients (44 %) n’avaient pas d’indication à un transfert en réanimation pour critère d’âge (>80 ans). Le sex-ratio était de 1/1, leur moyenne d’âge de 86 ans (80–94 ans). La durée d’hospitalisation moyenne était de 15jours (3–39jours) et la durée moyenne d’OHD de 5jours (1–15jours). Le taux de mortalité en HC des personnes récusées de réanimation sous OHD était de 71 %. Conclusion La pratique de l’OHD en HC a permis d’éviter 5 transferts en réanimation sur 18 patients graves éligibles aux soins continus avec une évolution favorable pour tous. Quant aux personnes de plus de 80 ans, non éligibles à la réanimation, la mortalité restait très élevée (71 %). Le taux de mortalité suite à la COVID en population gériatrique varie entre 11 et 44 % selon les études quel que soit le tableau clinique. Le taux de mortalité des patients de plus de 80 ans avec des signes de gravité reste très élevé mais n’est pas clairement établi.

However, its management by an unprepared team is difficult and carries poor outcomes. Hypoglycemia as the cause of sudden cardiac arrest is rarely reported. This case illustrates lifesaving procedures for sudden cardiac arrest secondary to hypoglycemia during cesarean delivery under spinal anesthesia. CASE SUMMARY: We report a case, from rural Ethiopia of sudden cardiac arrest secondary to hypoglycemia during cesarean delivery under spinal anesthesia. The case was successfully managed by a team of anesthetists and other operating teams. The mother and newborn were discharged from the hospital on the 7th postoperative day. CONCLUSION: Hypoglycemia during cesarean delivery under spinal anesthesia can cause sudden cardiac arrest. Therefore, identifying patients at risk of developing hypoglycemia, monitoring the patient’s condition, and initiating prompt intervention at the first sign of cardiovascular instability is advisable. Determining serum blood glucose levels at admission to the labor ward and monitoring blood glucose levels during spinal anesthesia should be routine practices.","Tilahun, Temesgen; Gudina, Guteta",J Med Case Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34321075/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s13256-021-02976-2,416

It is a global pandemic disease and has reached a new dimension with a higher death ratio. On 2 June 2020, World Health Organization (WHO) data showed more than 6,194,500 confirmed and 376,300 deaths globally due to the COVID-19. There are currently no approved medications or vaccines which have been claimed to be effective in COVID-19 prevention or treatment. Drug repurposing of available drugs and research studies for the search of new therapeutic agents are underway in various countries to try different combinations to treat their patients. It is too early to be sure of them as safe treatments because some reports seem to suggest some alarming side effects. However, a lot of work needs to be done to achieve a successful treatment result and the full safety and efficacy of the trial drugs will take some time to be developed.

648767,Application Value of Vital Signs Telemetry System for 2019 Novel Coronavirus Disease Suspected Cases in Isolation Wards,2020-08-24,"We previously reported in randomized controlled trials that maoto, a traditional herbal medicine, showed clinical and virological efficacy for seasonal influenza. In this study, a culturing system for influenza was used to test the effect of maoto. A549 cells in the culture were infected with influenza virus A (PR8) and followed after treatment with maoto; the virus titers in the culture supernatant, intracellular viral proteins, and viral RNA were determined. When infected cells were cultured with maoto for 24 hr, the virus titer and protein were significantly reduced compared with medium only. Other subtypes, A/H3N2, H1N1pdm, and B, were also inhibited by maoto. Proliferation of viral RNA in a 6 hr culture was inhibited by maoto in the early phase, especially in the first 30 min. Focusing on the entry step of the influenza virus, we found that endosomal pH, regulated by vacuolar-type H(+) ATPase (V-ATPase) located in the membrane, was increased when treated with maoto. We also found that uncoating of influenza viruses was also inhibited by maoto, resulting in the increase of the number of virus particles in endosomes. These results strongly suggest that the inhibition of endosomal acidification by maoto results in blocking influenza virus entry to cytoplasm, probably through the inhibition of V-ATPase. The present study provides evidence that supports the clinical use of maoto for the treatment of influenza.","Masui, Shinta; Nabeshima, Shigeki; Ajisaka, Kazuhiko; Yamauchi, Kei; Itoh, Ryota; Ishii, Kazunari; Soejima, Toshinori; Hiromatsu, Kenji",Evid Based Complement Alternat Med,https://doi.org/10.1155/2017/1062065; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28904550/,416
650778,Visual Snow-Like Symptoms and Posterior Uveitis following COVID-19 Infection,2021-05-29,"BACKGROUND: Major depressive disorder and associated mood syndromes are amongst the most common psychiatric disorders. To date, electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is considered the most effective short-term treatment for patients with severe or treatment-resistant depression. In clinical practice, there is considerable variation in the ECT dosing schedule, with the number of sessions typically ranging from 6 to 12, with early antidepressant effects being predictive of increased positive outcomes. We describe here an unusual case of a female patient with severe depression who did not respond to ECT until the 11th session, after which she had shown a drastic improvement in her mental state. CASE PRESENTATION: A 75-year-old female presented to the old age psychiatry inpatient unit with new onset dysphoric mood, anhedonia, and severe negativity. She scored 23 on the 17-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D), and was rated 6 on Clinical Global Impression severity (CGIS) by the responsible clinician. She suffered from post-natal depression fifty years ago and was successfully treated with ECT. She was therefore initiated on a course of ECT treatment. Her condition initially deteriorated, displaying features of catatonia and psychosis, unresponsive to ECT treatment or concurrent psychotropic medications. After 11th ECT session, she started to show signs of clinical improvement and returned close to her baseline mental state after a total of 17 ECT sessions. She remained well 3 months post-treatment, scoring 4 on HAM-D, Clinical Global Improvement or change (CGI-C) rated as 1 (very much improved). The diagnosis was ICD-10 F32.3 severe depressive episode with psychotic symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: we describe here an unusual case of delayed response to electroconvulsive therapy in the treatment of severe depressive disorder. Studies have shown the number of acute ECT treatments to be highly variable, affected by a number of factors including treatment frequency, condition treated and its severity, the ECT technical parameters, as well as concurrent use of pharmacological treatment. This may call for re-consideration of the current ECT treatment guidelines, requiring more research to help stratify and standardize the treatment regime.","Chen, Fangyue; Sidhom, Emad; Yang, Sharon; Ruiz-Mendoza, Eladia; Essem, Julius",BMC Psychiatry,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12888-021-03053-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33478427/,416

METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional survey of MERS survivors who required hospitalization in Saudi Arabia during 2016–2017, approximately 1 year after diagnosis. The Short-Form General Health Survey 36 (SF-36) was administered by telephone interview to assess 8 quality of life domains for MERS survivors and a sample of survivors of severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) without MERS. We compared mean SF-36 scores of MERS and non-MERS SARI survivors using independent t-test, and compared categorical variables using chi-square test. Adjusted analyses were performed using multiple linear regression. RESULTS: Of 355 MERS survivors, 83 were eligible and 78 agreed to participate. MERS survivors were younger than non-MERS SARI survivors (mean ± SD): (44.9 years ±12.9) vs (50.0 years ±13.6), p = 0.031. Intensive care unit (ICU) admissions were similar for MERS and non-MERS SARI survivors (46.2% vs. 57.1%), p = 0.20. After adjusting for potential confounders, there were no significant differences between MERS and non-MERS SARI survivors in physical component or mental component summary scores. MERS ICU survivors scored lower than MERS survivors not admitted to an ICU for physical function (p = 0.05), general health (p = 0.01), vitality (p = 0.03), emotional role (p = 0.03) and physical component summary (p < 0.02).

Methods: We searched electronic databases and the bibliographies of pertinent papers for articles. We considered studies in which the core result was the number of patients with bacterial (S. aureus) co-infection. We performed random effects meta-analysis (REM) because the studies included were sampled from a universe of different populations and high heterogeneity was anticipated. Using the Cochran’s Q statistic, the observed dispersion (heterogeneity) among effect sizes was assessed. The percentage of total variability in the estimates of the effect size was calculated with the I(2) index. To check for publication bias, the Egger weighted regression, Begg rank correlation and meta-funnel plot were used. We conducted meta-regression analysis to evaluate the variability between our outcomes and the covariates using computational options such as “methods of moments” and then “maximum likelihood” ratio. Results: We included 18 studies and retrieved data for 63,370 patients hospitalized with influenza-like illness, of which about 14,369 (22.67%) tested positive for COVID-19 by rRT-PCR. Of this number, 8,249 (57.4%) patient samples were analyzed. Bacterial, fungal and viral agents were detected in 3,038 (36.8%); S. aureus in 1,192 (39.2%). Five studies reported MRSA co-infection. Study quality ranged from 6 to 9 (median 7.1) on a JBI scale. From the meta-analysis, 33.1% patients were found to be coinfected (95%, CI 18.0 to 52.6%, Q=3473: df=17, I(2)=99·48%, p=0.00). The rate of S. aureus /COVID-19 co-infection was 25.6% (95% CI: 15.6 to 39.0, Q=783.4, df=17, I(2)=97.702%, p=0.003).The proportion of COVID-19/S. aureus co-infected patients with MRSA was 53.9% (95% CI, 24.5 to 80.9, n=66, 5 studies, Q=29.32, df=4, I(2)=86.369%, p=0.000). With the multivariate meta-regression model, study type (p=0.029), quality (p=0.000) and country (p=0.000) were significantly associated with heterogeneity. Conclusions: The pooled rates of S. aureus among COVID-19 patients documented in this study support the concern of clinicians about the presence of S. aureus in co-infections.

We propose as a putative randomized controlled trial that high-dose methotrexate with leucovorin (HDMTX-LR) rescue can abolish ‘PANIC’, thereby ‘left-shifting’ severe COVID-19 patients to the group majority of those infected with the SARS-CoV-2 virus, who are designated as having mild, even asymptomatic, disease. HDMTX-LR is endowed with broadly pleiotropic properties and is a repurposed, generic, inexpensive, and widely available agent which can be administered early in the course of severe COVID-19 thus rescuing the critical and irreplaceable gas-exchange alveoli. Further, we describe a preventative treatment intervention regimen for those designated as having mild to moderate COVID-19 disease, but who exhibit features which herald the transition to the severe variant of this novel Coronavirus. Both of our proposed hypothesis-driven questions should be urgently subjected to rigorous assessment in the context of randomized controlled trials, in order to confirm or refute the contention that the approaches characterized herein, are in fact capable of exerting mitigating, if not abolishing, effects upon the SARS-CoV-2 triggering of the ‘PANIC Attack’. Confirmation of our immunotherapy hypothesis would have far-reaching ramifications for the current pandemic, along with yielding invaluable lessons from which we can more effectively prepare for the next challenge to global health.","Frohman, Elliot M.; Cruz, Roberto Alejandro; Longmuir, Reid; Steinman, Lawrence; Zamvil, Scott S.; Villemarette-Pittman, Nicole R.; Frohman, Teresa C.; Parsons, Matthew S.",J Neurol Sci,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022510X20302720?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0022510X20302720; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32534807/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jns.2020.116935,416

Just as student nurses are taught to reflect on their practice to effectively meet clients’ needs, educators also need to be well versed in self-reflection to enhance their teaching methods. Self-reflection is the deliberate consideration of experiences, which when guided by the literature helps an individual gain insight and improve practice. Educators should not only opt for personal reflection but should also seek the views of their students and peers. Self-reflection becomes critical when it goes beyond mere reflection, questioning teaching assumptions, and addressing their social and political context. Given the remarked benefits of using self-reflection in education, and the current COVID-19 global repercussions which have urged faculties to try alternative methods of teaching, a concise guide to self-reflection is hereby provided for use by nurse educators.","Grech, Joseph",Teach Learn Nurs,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1557308720301037; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.teln.2020.09.001; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33013247/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1557308720301037,416

Drawing on interviews with port-based support organizations and various other international organizations, we outline how pre-existing structural marginalizations of seafarers in distant water fishing has made them particularly vulnerable to the negative impacts of pandemic management policies for seafarers. We focus our analysis on obstacles to crew change and reduced access to crucial shore services. The basis of these longer term marginalizations includes the exclusion of fishing from the Maritime Labour Convention, the marginal status of fishing among global organizations concerned with seafarers, the dispersed ownership of fishing vessels compared to concentrated corporate ownership in shipping, lack of unionization, and frequent inaccessibility of consular assistance in fishing ports. We also highlight differences among important fishing ports, showing that repatriation of crew and access to shore services is the outcome of negotiation among a constellation of port-based actors.","Vandergeest, Peter; Marschke, Melissa; MacDonnell, Mallory",Mar Policy,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0308597X21004073?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34539041/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.marpol.2021.104796; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0308597X21004073,416

Although some artificially synthesized MAWs have deleterious effects, there is still a lack of a strategy for the classification of non-occurring sequences as potentially malicious or benign. In this work, by using Markovian models with multiple-testing correction, we reveal significant absent oligomers, which are statistically expected to exist. This suggests that their absence is due to negative selection. We survey genomes and proteomes covering the diversity of life and find thousands of significant absent sequences. Common significant MAWs are often mono- or dinucleotide tracts, or palindromic. Significant viral MAWs are often restriction sites and may indicate unknown restriction motifs. Surprisingly, significant mammal genome MAWs are often present, but rare, in other mammals, suggesting that they are suppressed but not completely forbidden. Significant human MAWs are frequently present in prokaryotes, suggesting immune function, but rarely present in human viruses, indicating viral mimicry of the host. More than one-fourth of human proteins are one substitution away from containing a significant MAW, with the majority of replacements being predicted harmful. We provide a web-based, interactive database of significant MAWs across genomes and proteomes.","Koulouras, Grigorios; Frith, Martin C",Nucleic Acids Res,https://doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkab139; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33693858/,416

Introduction: Many healthcare facilities in low-and middle-income countries are inadequately resourced and may lack optimal organization and governance, especially concerning surgical health systems. COVID-19 has the potential to decimate these already strained surgical healthcare services unless health systems take stringent measures to protect healthcare workers from viral exposure and ensure the continuity of specialized care for the patients. Inclusion criteria: This review will preferentially consider systematic reviews of experimental and quasi-experimental studies, as well as individual studies of such designs, evaluating the effect of different PPE on the risk of COVID-19 infection in healthcare workers (HCWs) involved in emergency trauma surgery. Methods: We will conduct several searches in the LOVE (Living OVerview of Evidence) platform for COVID-19, a system that performs automated regular searches in PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), and over thirty other sources. The search results will be presented according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) flow diagram. Critical appraisal of the eligible studies for methodological quality will be conducted. Data will be extracted using the standardized data extraction tool in Covidence.

As it stands now, Afghanistan seems to be ill-prepared to embrace a successful implementation of the COVID-19 vaccination program because of a spate of challenges. These include, but are not limited to, the insufficient number of vaccinators, a dearth of fully integrated functioning cold chain, challenging geographical barriers, cultural issues, insecurity, and protracted conflict. The COVID-19 infodemic along with vaccine mistrust in the country will lead to a pervasive public vaccine hesitancy in Afghanistan, which will present serious obstacles to the COVID-19 immunization efforts. The politicization of the Ministry of Public Health (MoPH) and the complaints of embezzlement and misuse of the pandemic aid have already eroded public trust during the pandemic. To ensure a large-scale and equitable distribution of COVID-19 vaccines, the cold chain infrastructure should be strengthened, and the immunization personnel trained. Antivaccination propaganda and misinformation should be tackled with effective communication approaches and effective community engagement, which consider culturally relevant messages appropriate to the culture and people.

This universal SARS‐CoV‐2 enrichment probe set contains 502 120nt ssDNA biotin‐labeled probes designed based on all available SARS‐CoV‐2 viral sequences and it can be used to enrich for SARS‐CoV‐2 sequences without prior knowledge of type or subtype. Following the CDC health and safety guidelines, marked enrichment was demonstrated in a virus strain sample from a cell culture, three nasopharyngeal swab samples (cycle threshold [Ct] values: 32.36, 36.72, and 38.44) from patients diagnosed with COVID‐19 (positive control) and four throat swab samples from patients without COVID‐19 (negative controls), respectively. Moreover, based on these high‐quality sequences, we discuss the heterozygosity and viral expression during coronavirus replication, and its phylogenetic relationship with other selected high‐quality samples from The Genome Variation Map (GVM). Therefore, this universal SARS‐CoV‐2 enrichment probe system can capture and enrich SARS‐CoV‐2 viral sequences selectively and effectively in different samples, especially clinical swab samples with a relatively low concentration of viral particles.

656827,A novel optical biosensor for the early diagnosis of sepsis and severe Covid-19: the PROUD study,2020-11-19,"BACKGROUND: The severity of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a multifactorial condition. An increasing body of evidence argues for a direct implication of vitamin D deficiency, low serum calcium on poor outcomes in COVID-19 patients. This study was designed to investigate the relationship between these two factors and COVID-19 in-hospital mortality. MATERIALS: This is a prospective study, including 120 severe cases of COVID-19, admitted at the department of Reanimation-Anesthesia. Vitamin D was assessed by an immuno-fluoroassay method. Total serum calcium by a colorimetric method, then, corrected for serum albumin levels. The association with in-hospital mortality was assessed using the Kaplan-Meier survival curve, proportional Cox regression analyses and the receiver operating characteristic curve. RESULTS: Hypovitaminosis D and hypocalcemia were very common, occurring in 75% and 35.8% of patients. When analyzing survival, both were significantly associated with in-hospital mortality in a dose-effect manner (p(Log-Rank) = 0.009 and 0.001 respectively). A cutoff value of 39 nmol/l for vitamin D and 2.05 mmol/l for corrected calcemia could predict poor prognosis with a sensitivity of 76% and 84%, and a specificity of 69% and 60% respectively. Hazard ratios were (HR = 6.9, 95% CI [2.0–24.1], p = 0.002 and HR = 6.2, 95% CI [2.1–18.3], p = 0.001) respectively. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates the high frequency of hypocalcemia and hypovitaminosis D in severe COVID-19 patients and provides further evidence of their potential link to poor short-term prognosis. It is, therefore, possible that the correction of hypocalcemia, as well as supplementation with vitamin D, may improve the vital prognosis.","Bennouar, Salam; Cherif, Abdelghani Bachir; Kessira, Amel; Bennouar, Djamel-Eddine; Abdi, Samia",Journal of the American College of Nutrition,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33434117/; https://doi.org/10.1080/07315724.2020.1856013,416

In its early years, global sourcing was examined mostly from “in-house” development and procurement perspectives; and in the last several years, research focus has shifted to “outsourcing” activities. Along with this shift from internal to external focus on global sourcing, many researchers and business practitioners have applied a core competency argument to justify increased levels of outsourcing activities on a global basis. Although the beneficial aspects of outsourcing are assumed in most cases, no consensus exists in reality as to the effect of outsourcing. Furthermore, the increased instability of the exchange rate environment in the last several years has also led to increased difficulties in managing globally scattered operations that were once fashionable in the 1980s-90s under the rubric of global strategy. In this article, the authors explore potential limitations and negative consequences of outsourcing strategy on a global scale.","Kotabe, Masaaki; Murray, Janet Y.",Industrial Marketing Management,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0019850103001056; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0019850103001056,416

This study thus aimed to (1) compare psychological distress (including fear of COVID-19 infection, stress, anxiety, and depression), perceived weight stigma, and problematic internet-related behaviors between schoolchildren with and without overweight; (2) assess whether perceived weight stigma and problematic internet-related behaviors explained psychological distress. METHODS: Schoolchildren (n = 1357; mean age = 10.7 years) with overweight (n = 236) and without overweight (n = 1121) completed an online survey assessing their fear of COVID-19 infection, stress, anxiety, depression, perceived weight stigma, problematic smartphone application use, problematic social media use, and problematic gaming. RESULTS: Schoolchildren with overweight had significantly higher levels of COVID-19 infection fear, stress, depression, perceived weight stigma, and problematic social media use than those without overweight. Regression models showed that perceived weight stigma and problematic internet-related behaviors were significant predictors of psychological distress among schoolchildren with overweight. CONCLUSION: Strategies to manage perceived weight stigma and problematic internet-related behaviors may have a positive influence on mental health among schoolchildren with overweight under health-threatening circumstances, such as the current COVID-19 pandemic.","Chen, Chao-Ying; Chen, I-Hua; O’Brien, Kerry S.; Latner, Janet D.; Lin, Chung-Ying",Int J Obes (Lond),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33495523/; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41366-021-00741-5,416

However, the presence of SARS-CoV-2 has not been detected in the human eye to date. We undertook this study to analyze the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in human post-mortem ocular tissues. Methods: The expression of SARS-CoV-2 RNA was assessed by RT-PCR in corneal and scleral tissues from 33 surgical-intended donors who were eliminated from a surgical use per Eye Bank Association of America (EBAA) donor screening guidelines or medical director review or positive COVID-19 test. Ocular levels of SARS-CoV-2 RNA (RT-PCR), Envelope and Spike proteins (immunohistochemistry) and anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgM antibodies (ELISA) in blood were evaluated in 10 COVID-19 donors. Findings: Of 132 ocular tissues from 33 surgical-intended donors, the positivity rate for SARS-CoV-2 RNA was ~13% (17/132). Of 10 COVID-19 donors, six had PCR positive post-mortem nasopharyngeal swabs whereas eight exhibited positive post-mortem anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG levels. Among 20 eyes recovered from 10 COVID-19 donors: three conjunctival, one anterior corneal, five posterior corneal, and three vitreous swabs tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA. SARS-CoV-2 spike and envelope proteins were detected in epithelial layer of the corneas that were procured without Povidone-Iodine (PVP-I) disinfection. Interpretations: Our study showed a small but noteworthy prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in ocular tissues from COVID-19 donors. These findings underscore the criticality of donor screening guidelines, post-mortem nasopharyngeal PCR testing and PVP-I disinfection protocol to eliminate any tissue harboring SARS-CoV-2 being used for corneal transplantation.","Sawant, O.

SARS-CoV-2 emerging from Wuhan, China took only three months to cover > 200 countries worldwide by infecting more than 2.4 million people and killing more than 150000 people. Though, this infection at the early stage creates seasonal flu-like symptoms with a higher illness, it eventually causes a higher mortality. Epidemiological studies not only find the causes of many health issues, but also suggest preventive measures. This study aimed to see the link between environment temperature and COVID-19 cases. Study design The monthly average environment temperature (MAET) and various COVID-19 cases of a country were collected, and analyzed to see the relationship between these parameters. Methods Univariate analysis and statistical modeling were used to determine the relationship between environment temperature and different COVID-19 cases. Results This study found that the majorities of the countries having higher COVID-19 cases are located in the higher latitude (colder region) in the globe. As of 20th April data available, statistical analyses by various methods have found that strong negative correlations with statistical significance exist between MAET and several COVID-19 cases including total cases, active cases and cases per million of a country [Spearman correlation coefficients were -0.45, -0.42, and -0.50 for total cases, active cases and cases/per million, respectively]. Analysis by statistical log-linear regression model further supports that the chance of COVID-19 patients is fewer in warmer countries than in colder countries.

663544,POS-529 COVID 19 INFECTION AMONG HAEMODIALYSIS PATIENTS OF A SPECIALISED KIDNEY HOSPITAL IN BANGLADESH,2021-04-30,"BACKGROUND: Indonesia has the second largest tuberculosis (TB) burden globally. Attempts to scale-up TB control efforts have focused on TB households. However, in most high burden settings, considerable Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) transmission occurs outside TB households. A better understanding of transmission dynamics in an urban setting in Indonesia will be crucial for the TB Control Program in scaling up efforts towards elimination of TB in a more targeted way. Therefore, the study aims to measure TB prevalence and incidence in household contacts and neighbourhoods in the vicinity of known TB cases and to assess their genomic and epidemiological relatedness. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: Individuals (~1000) living in the same household as a case diagnosed with pulmonary TB (n = 250) or in a neighbouring household (~4500 individuals) will be screened for TB symptoms and by chest x-ray. Two sputum samples will be collected for microbiological analysis from anyone with a productive cough. Any person found to have TB will be treated by the National TB Control Program. All those with no evidence of TB disease will have a repeat screen at 12 months. Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) and social network analysis (SNA) will be conducted on Index cases and contacts diagnosed with TB.","Alisjahbana, Bachti; Koesoemadinata, Raspati Cundarani; Hadisoemarto, Panji Fortuna; Lestari, Bony Wiem; Hartati, Sri; Chaidir, Lidya; Huang, Chuan-Chin; Murray, Megan; Hill, Philip Campbell; McAllister, Susan Margaret",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34388190/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0256043,416

664712,Personalized therapy approach for hospitalized patients with COVID-19,2020-07-10,"Alternative splicing (AS) of RNA is a key mechanism that results in the expression of multiple transcript isoforms from single genes and leads to an increase in the complexity of both the transcriptome and proteome. Regulation of AS is critical for the correct functioning of many biological pathways, while disruption of AS can be directly pathogenic in diseases such as cancer or cause risk for complex disorders. Current short-read sequencing technologies achieve high read depth but are limited in their ability to resolve complex isoforms. In this review we examine how long-read sequencing (LRS) technologies can address this challenge by covering the entire RNA sequence in a single read and thereby distinguish isoform changes that could impact RNA regulation or protein function. Coupling LRS with technologies such as single cell sequencing, targeted sequencing and spatial transcriptomics is producing a rapidly expanding suite of technological approaches to profile alternative splicing at the isoform level with unprecedented detail. In addition, integrating LRS with genotype now allows the impact of genetic variation on isoform expression to be determined. Recent results demonstrate the potential of these techniques to elucidate the landscape of splicing, including in tissues such as the brain where AS is particularly prevalent. Finally, we also discuss how AS can impact protein function, potentially leading to novel therapeutic targets for a range of diseases.","De Paoli-Iseppi, Ricardo; Gleeson, Josie; Clark, Michael B.",Front Mol Biosci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34409069/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fmolb.2021.711733,416

Uncertainty around its effects and transmission in aerosol generating procedures (AGP’s) has led to disagreement within maxillofacial surgeons into the safety of orthognathic surgery during the pandemic. We present a local case series of orthognathic surgery undertaken during the Covid-19 pandemic. To our knowledge no such similar study has been reported worldwide. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data was collected from the 1(st) June to 30(th) November 2020 for all patients undergoing orthognathic surgery by a single consultant. All procedures and inpatient stays were performed ‘off site’ at the local Spire Healthcare Group plc© facility. A strict pre-operative 2-week self-isolation period and negative Covid-19 testing was mandatory. All procedures were classified as AGP’s and personal protective equipment (PPE) was worn in line with local guidelines. The primary outcome was 30-day Covid-19 infection among patients, with day 0 the date of surgery. Secondary outcome measures included duration of stay, return to theatre and complications. RESULTS: 59 patients were identified. 42/59 had bimaxillary procedures and 17/59 single jaw. 9/17 had maxillary and 8/17 had mandibular procedures. 3/59 had simultaneous genioplasty. Median duration of stay was 1 night (range 1-3). Immediate and late complications were seen in 3% (2/59) and 3% (2/59) respectively. 1% (1/59) returned to theatre. Zero patients tested positive in the 30-day post-operative period. No staff members tested positive for the duration of the study. CONCLUSION: Adopting strict safety protocols, orthognathic surgery can be safely delivered during the pandemic without detriment to the patient or staff.","Glen, P.; Aurora, F.; Thomas, S.; Kissun, D.",Br J Oral Maxillofac Surg,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0266435621000243?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bjoms.2021.01.005; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0266435621000243; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33579540/,416

By considering the most up to date information on GDP and carbon intensity of production, this paper represents one of the first attempts to estimate the CO2 emissions change that have taken place in Europe during the first six months of 2020. Results show that more than 195,600 thousand tons of CO2 have been avoided between January and June 2020, compared to the same period of the previous year, representing a -12.1% emissions change. The largest reductions have taken place in the Manufacturing, Wholesale, Retail Trade, Transport, Accommodation and Food Service sectors, accounting for more than 93.7% of total CO2 change. Spain, Italy and France have been the most affected areas with -106,600 thousand tons emissions drop. In line with the results provided by previous studies, this paper highlights that the geographical and the sectoral distribution of the CO2 emissions change has been largely influenced by the magnitude of the COVID-19 impacts. In addition, the carbon intensity of production, characterizing the most affected economic activities, has been the main element of differentiation compared to the previous 2008 crisis. By providing preliminary estimation of the CO2 emissions change that have taken place across geographical and sectoral activities, this paper contributes to the existing climate policy debate and can support future estimation of CO2 variations both in a context of confinement release as well as in a context of reintroduced COVID-19 restrictions.","Andreoni, Valeria",Sci Total Environ,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.145115; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33477052/,416

Positive psychology has for several years been dealing with this concept, which is well known to the general public, but which has been the subject of major conceptual development in the field of science. It seems to us that the concept of optimism can be particularly useful in understanding and influencing the behaviour of our fellow citizens during the period of confinement that is currently imposed on everyone, in the same way that we must consider the consequences in the short, medium and long term, both economically and in terms of the moral and physical health of our fellow citizens, that is, after the period of confinement. Traditionally, being optimistic means being confident in the positive outcome of an event, whereas pessimism means expecting the worst. The uncertainty that this virus imposes on us and the new situations that it brings about, forces us to think the world in uncertain terms, which can be destabilizing. Understanding the contribution of the concept of optimism in the potential of the adaptive processes that each of us may or may not be able to mobilize to face and adapt to this unprecedented and unprecedented health crisis is essential. This will undoubtedly be a major challenge for the social sciences and psychology. This is why we believe that the concept of optimism can help to provide additional insights that will enable us to better grasp the rational (or non-rational) behaviours that we may face in the future, and in which we are already involved.","Martin-Krumm, Charles; Tarquinio, Cyril; Tarquinio, Camille",Annales medico-psychologiques,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32836302/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003448720301839?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0003448720301839; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.amp.2020.06.004,416
668391,Severe clinical spectrum with high mortality in pediatric patients with COVID-19 and multisystem inflammatory syndrome,2020-08-14,"Due to the COVID-19 virus being highly transmittable, frequently cleaning and disinfecting facilities is common guidance in public places. However, the more often the environment is cleaned, the higher the risk of cleaning staff getting infected. Therefore, strong demand for sanitizing areas in automatic modes is undoubtedly expected. In this paper, an autonomous disinfection vehicle with an Ultraviolet-C (UVC) lamp is designed and implemented using an ultra-wideband (UWB) positioning sensor. The UVC dose for 90% inactivation of the reproductive ability of COVID-19 is 41.7 J/m(2), which a 40 W UVC lamp can achieve within a 1.6 m distance for an exposure time of 30 s. With this UVC lamp, the disinfection vehicle can effectively sterilize in various scenarios. In addition, the high-accuracy UWB positioning system, with the time difference of arrival (TDOA) algorithm, is also studied for autonomous vehicle navigation in indoor environments. The number of UWB tags that use a synchronization protocol between UWB anchors can be unlimited. Moreover, this proposed Gradient Descent (GD), which uses Taylor method, is a high-efficient algorithm for finding the optimal position for real-time computation due to its low error and short calculating time. The generalized traversal path planning procedure, with the edge searching method, is presented to improve the efficiency of autonomous navigation. The average error of the practical navigation demonstrated in the meeting room is 0.10 m. The scalability of the designed system to different application scenarios is also discussed and experimentally demonstrated. Hence, the usefulness of the proposed UWB sensor applied to UVC disinfection vehicles to prevent COVID-19 infection is verified by employing it to sterilize indoor environments without human operation.","Huang, Shih-Ping; Neo, Jin-Feng; Chen, Yu-Yao; Chen, Chien-Bang; Wu, Ting-Wei; Peng, Zheng-An; Tsai, Wei-Ting; Liou, Chong-Yi; Sheng, Wang-Huei; Mao, Shau-Gang",Sensors (Basel),https://doi.org/10.3390/s21155223; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34372460/,416

MATERIALS AND METHODS: This is a prospective, cross‐sectional study of 114 COVID‐19 positive patients diagnosed using RT‐PCR‐based testing over a 6‐week period. The 2‐item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ‐2) and the 2‐item Generalized Anxiety Disorder questionnaire (GAD‐2) were used to measure depressed mood and anxiety level, respectively, at enrollment and for participants’ baseline, pre‐COVID‐19 state. Severity of smell loss, loss of taste, nasal obstruction, rhinorrhea/mucus production, fever, cough and shortness of breath (SOB) during COVID‐19 were assessed. RESULTS: PHQ‐2 and GAD‐2 significantly (p<0.001) increased from baseline to enrollment. PHQ‐2 was associated with smell loss (adjusted incidence rate ratio [aIRR]=1.40, 95%CI: 1.10‐1.78, p=0.006), age (aIRR=1.02, 95%CI: 1.01‐1.04, p=0.006), and baseline PHQ‐2 score (aIRR=1.39, 95%CI: 1.09‐1.76, p=0.007). GAD‐2 score was associated with smell loss (aIRR=1.29, 95%CI: 1.02‐1.62, p=0.035), age (aIRR=1.02, 95%CI: 1.01‐1.04, p=0.025) and baseline GAD‐2 score (aIRR=1.55, 95%CI: 1.24‐1.93, p<0.001). Loss of taste also exhibited similar associations with PHQ‐2 and GAD‐2. PHQ‐2 and GAD‐2 scores were not associated with severities of any other symptoms during the COVID‐19 course. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the occurrence of symptoms—such as SOB—associated with severe manifestations of COVID‐19, only the severities of smell and taste loss were associated with depressed mood and anxiety. These results may raise the novel possibility of emotional disturbance as a CNS manifestation of COVID‐19 given trans‐olfactory tract penetration of the central nervous system (CNS) by coronaviruses.","Speth, Marlene M.; Singer‐Cornelius, Thirza; Oberle, Michael; Gengler, Isabelle; Brockmeier, Steffi J.; Sedaghat, Ahmad R.",Laryngoscope,https://doi.org/10.1002/lary.28964; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32617983/,416
670895,CONVALESCENT PLASMA FOR COVID19 – HOW LONG SHOULD A DONOR BE EXCLUDED FROM DONATION?,2020-07-15,"This paper deals with one of the key problems of e-healthcare which is the security. Patients are worried about the confidentiality of their electronic medical record (EMR) which could be used to expose their identities. It is high time to revisit the confidentiality and security issues of the existing telehealth system. Intruders can perform sniffing, spoofing, or phishing operations effortlessly during the online exchange of the EMR using a digital platform. The EMR must be transmitted anonymously with a high degree of hardness of encryption by protecting the authentication, confidentiality, and integrity criteria of the patient. These requirements recommend the security of the current system to be improved. In this paper, a neural synchronization-guided concatenation of header and secret shares with the ability to transmit the EMR with an end-to-end security protocol has been proposed. This proposed methodology breaks down the EMR into the n number of secret shares and transmits to the n number of recipients. The original EMR can be reconstructed after the amalgamation of a minimum k (threshold) number of secret shares. The novelty of the technique is that one share should come from a specific recipient to whom a special privilege is given to recreate the EMR among such a predefined number of shares. In the absence of this privileged share, the original EMR cannot be reconstructed. This proposed technique has passed various parametric tests. The results are compared with existing benchmark techniques. The results of the proposed technique have shown robust and effective potential.","Sarkar, Arindam; Singh, Moirangthem Marjit; Mandal, Jyotsna Kumar",Arab J Sci Eng,https://doi.org/10.1007/s13369-020-05136-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33425644/,416

However, adoption of these measures varies greatly. We aimed to improve health messaging to increase adherence to public health behaviours to reduce COVID-19 transmission by: 1) determining attitudes towards public health measures and current behaviours; 2) identifying barriers to following public health measures; and, 3) identifying public health communication strategies. We recruited participants from a random panel of 3000 phone numbers across Alberta to fill a predetermined quota: age (18–29; 30–59; 60+ years), geographic location (urban; rural), and whether they had school-age children. Two researchers coded and themed all transcripts. We performed content analysis and in-depth thematic analysis. Nine focus groups were conducted with 2–8 participants/group in August-September, 2020. Several themes were identified: 1) importance of public health measures; 2) compliance with public health measures; 3) critiques of public health messaging; and 4) suggestions for improving public health messaging. Physical distancing and masking were seen as more important than using a contact tracing app. There were mixed views around willingness to take COVID-19 vaccine. Current public health messaging was perceived as conflicting. Participants felt that consistent messaging and using social media to reach younger people would be helpful. In conclusion, these findings provide insights that can be used to inform targeted (e.g., by age, current behaviour) public health communications to encourage behaviors that reduce COVID-19 transmission.","Benham, Jamie L.; Lang, Raynell; Kovacs Burns, Katharina; MacKean, Gail; Léveillé, Tova; McCormack, Brandi; Sheikh, Hasan; Fullerton, Madison M.; Tang, Theresa; Boucher, Jean-Christophe; Constantinescu, Cora; Mourali, Mehdi; Oxoby, Robert J.; Manns, Braden J.; Hu, Jia; Marshall, Deborah A.",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33606782/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0246941,416

Unfortunately, randomized trials failed mainly because the septic patient was considered as a homogeneous entity. All this creates a sort of therapeutic impotence in everyday clinical practice in treating patients with septic shock. The need to customize therapy on each patient with sepsis has now become an established necessity. In this scenario, adjuvant therapies can help if interpreted as modulators of the immune system. Indeed, the host's immune response differs from patient to patient based on the virulence of the pathogen, comorbidity, infection site, and prolonged hospitalization. In this review, we summarize the rationale for using immunoglobulins as an adjunctive treatment.

We examined the serologic response in healthcare workers up to 12 weeks after a well-documented and contained outbreak and compared results with findings from earlier serologic testing in the same population. METHODS: This study followed 166 health care workers of the University Perinatal Care Center, Regensburg, Germany, for up to 12 weeks. 27 of the subjects had previously tested positive for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 by PCR testing and developed COVID-19. Serologic responses were tested with two independent commercially available test kits. RESULTS: 77.8% of COVID-19 study subjects developed a specific IgG-response over the course of the 12-week study, while none of the COVID-19 contact groups had a detectable IgG response. Amongst most COVID-19 patients the values of detectable IgG-responses significantly increased over time as confirmed with both tests, while that of positive IgA responses decreased. Between the number of reported symptoms and antibody responses in COVID-19 patients no correlation was found and no new cases of seroconversion were identified in asymptomatic coworkers with negative PCR during the outbreak. CONCLUSIONS: Immune response after COVID-19 increases significantly over time but still approximately 22% of COVID-19 patients did not mount a measurable serologic immune response within 60 days. Exposed co-workers did not develop any relevant antibody levels at all. We conclude that immunity after infection increases over time, but the antibody response does not develop reliably in all infected people.","Malfertheiner, Sara Fill; Brandstetter, Susanne; Roth, Samra; Harner, Susanne; Buntrock-Döpke, Heike; Toncheva, Antoaneta A.; Borchers, Natascha; Gruber, Rudolf; Ambrosch, Andreas; Kabesch, Michael; Häusler, Sebastian",J Clin Virol,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcv.2020.104575; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32805631/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1386653220303176; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1386653220303176?v=s5,416

METHODS: 206 serum samples were collected from patients who were treated in the General Hospital of the Central Theater Command of the PLA between January 18 and April 4, 2020. 270 serum samples from healthy blood donors were used as control. IgM and total antibodies (Ab) against SARS-CoV-2 were detected by Chemiluminescence Microparticle Immunoassay (CMIA). RESULTS: Among the 206 patients, the positive rate of IgM and Ab were 149/206 (72.3 %) and 187/206 (90.8 %), respectively. And the specificity of IgM and Ab detection were 99.3 % and 98.9 %, respectively. The sensitivity of CMIA for Ab detection was significantly higher than that of IgM. An increase of the positive rate and S/CO value for detecting IgM and Ab accompanied with the increasing of days post-disease onset (d.p.o.) were observed. The positive rate of Ab detected by CMIA increased rapidly after 7 d.p.o., while that of IgM was obviously increased after 14 d.p.o.. In addition, the age and gender of these patients did not affect the seroconversion and titer of antibodies during the whole course. The disease-severity of patients had no effect on the seroconversion of antibodies. However, the critical patients possessed a much higher antibody titers than the no-critical cases after 14 d.p.o.. CONCLUSIONS: The CMIA can provide important complementation to nucleic acid assay and help to enhance the accuracy and capacity of diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Liu, Wanbing; Kou, Guomei; Dong, Yaoyu; Zheng, Yaqiong; Ding, Yinjuan; Ni, Wenxu; Wu, Wanlei; Tang, Shi; Xiong, Zhou; Zhang, Ying; Liu, Lei; Zheng, Shangen",J Clin Virol,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcv.2020.104576; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1386653220303188; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32763810/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1386653220303188?v=s5,416

The current study aimed to identify industry and workplace characteristics associated with the use of this COVID-19 contact tracing app. Methods: This cross-sectional study of full-time workers used an online survey. Multiple logistic regression analysis was used to evaluate the associations of industry and workplace characteristics with contact tracing app use. Results: Of the 27,036 participants, 25.1% had downloaded the COCOA. Workers in the public service (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 1.29, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.14-1.45) and information technology (aOR = 1.38, 95% CI: 1.20-1.58) industries were more likely to use the app than were those in the manufacturing industry. In contrast, app usage was less common among workers in the retail and wholesale (aOR = 0.87, 95% CI: 0.76-0.99) and food/beverage (aOR = 0.81, 95% CI: 0.70-0.94) industries, but further adjustment for business size attenuated these associations. Workers at larger companies were more likely to use the app. Compared with permanent employees, the odds of using the app were higher for managers and civil servants but lower for those who were self-employed. Conclusions: One possible reason for the under-implementation of the contact tracing app in the retail and wholesale and food/beverage industries is small business size, as suggested by the fully adjusted model results. An awareness campaign should be conducted to promote the widespread use of the contact tracing app in these industries.","Ishimaru, T.; Ibayashi, K.; Nagata, M.; Hino, A.; Tateishi, S.; Tsuji, M.; Ogami, A.; Matsuda, S.; Fujino, Y.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.04.01.21254744v1?rss=1; https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.04.01.21254744,416
681300,Impact of coronavirus disease 2019 on the clinical diagnosis and treatment of breast cancer in China,2021-03-05,"Landscape modification represents one of the most severe threats to biodiversity from local to global scales. Conversion of forest to agricultural production generally results in patches of habitat that subdivide or isolate populations, alter the behavior of species, modify interspecific interactions, reduce biodiversity, and compromise ecosystem processes. Moreover, conversion may increase exposure of humans to zoonoses to which they would otherwise rarely be exposed. We evaluated the effects of forest conversion to agriculture, and its subsequent successional dynamics, on bat communities in a region of the Amazon that was predominantly closed-canopy rainforest. Based on a nonmanipulative experiment, we quantified differences in species composition, community structure, and taxonomic biodiversity among closed-canopy forest (bosque), agricultural lands (chacra), and secondary forest (purma) for two phyllostomid guilds (frugivores and gleaning animalivores) during the wet and dry seasons. Responses were complex and guild-specific. For frugivores, species composition (species abundance distributions) differed between all possible pairs of habitats in both wet and dry seasons. For gleaning animalivores, species composition differed between all possible pairs of habitats in the dry season, but no differences characterized the wet season. Ecological structure (rank abundance distributions) differed among habitats in guild-specific and season-specific manners. For frugivores, mean diversity, evenness, and dominance were greater in bosque than in purma; mean dominance was greater in bosque than in chacra, but local rarity was greater in chacra than in bosque, and no differences were manifest between purma and chacra. For gleaning animalivores, mean diversity and evenness were greater in bosque than in purma, but no differences were manifest between chacra and bosque, or between purma and chacra. Such results have important implications for management, conservation, and the epidemiology of zoonotic diseases. La actual modificación del paisaje, a escalas que van de lo local a lo global, es una de las amenazas más severas a la biodiversidad. De manera general, la conversión de bosques a áreas agrícolas produce parches de hábitat que subdividen o aíslan poblaciones, alteran la conducta de las especies, modifican las interacciones interespecíficas, reducen la biodiversidad y comprometen las funciones de los ecosistemas. Más aún, la transformación de estos ambientes puede incrementar la probabilidad de que las poblaciones humanas interactúen con zoonosis con las que de otra manera raramente entrarían en contacto. Evaluamos los efectos de la conversión de hábitat en comunidades de murciélagos en una región de Amazonia en la que la vegetación dominante es un bosque lluvioso de copas cerradas, y en la cual los efectos de la conversión a usos agrícolas sobre la biodiversidad, y la subsecuente dinámica sucesional, son aún poco comprendidos. Por medio de un experimento no-manipulativo, cuantificamos las diferencias en composición de especies, estructura de la comunidad y diversidad taxonómica entre bosque cerrado (bosque), áreas agrícolas (chacra) y bosque secundario (purma) para dos gremios tróficos de murciélagos filostómidos (frugívoros y forrajeadores de sustrato) durante dos temporadas (secas y lluvias). Las respuestas fueron complejas y diferentes para cada gremio. Para los frugívoros, la composición de especies (distribución de las abundancias) fue diferente para todos los posibles pares de hábitats tanto para secas como para lluvias. Para los forrajeadores de sustrato, la composición de especies difirió entre todos los posibles pares de hábitats en la temporada seca, pero no en la de lluvias. La estructura ecológica (distribuciones rango-abundancia) fue también específica para gremios y temporadas. Para los frugívoros, la diversidad promedio, equidad y dominancia fueron mayores en bosque que en purma; la dominancia promedio fue mayor en bosque que en chacra, pero la rareza local fue mayor en chacra que en bosque, y no se encontraron diferencias entre purma y chacra. Para los forrajeadores de sustrato, la diversidad promedio y la dominancia fueron mayores en bosque que en purma, pero no se detectaron diferencias entre chacra y bosque, o entre purma y chacra. Estos resultados tienen importantes implicaciones para el manejo, conservación y epidemiología de zoonosis.","Willig, Michael R; Presley, Steven J; Plante, Jean-Luc; Bloch, Christopher P; Solari, Sergio; Pacheco, Victor; Weaver, Scott C",Journal of Mammalogy,https://doi.org/10.1093/jmammal/gyz023; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30846887/,416

METHODS: Mamás del Río is a community-based, MNH programme with comprehensive supervision covering monthly meetings with community health workers (CHW), community leaders and health facilities. With the onset of the lockdown, supervisors made telephone calls to discuss measures against COVID-19, governmental support, CHW activities in communities and provision of MNH care and COVID-19 preparedness at facilities. As part of the programme’s ongoing mixed methods evaluation, we analysed written summaries of supervisor calls collected during the first 2 months of Peru’s lockdown. RESULTS: Between March and May 2020, supervisors held two rounds of calls with CHWs and leaders of 68 communities and staff from 17 facilities. Most communities banned entry of foreigners, but about half tolerated residents travelling to regional towns for trade and social support. While social events were forbidden, strict home isolation was only practised in a third of communities as conflicting with daily routine. By the end of April, first clusters of suspected cases were reported in communities. COVID-19 test kits, training and medical face masks were not available in most rural facilities. Six out of seven facilities suspended routine antenatal and postnatal consultations while two-thirds of CHWs resumed home visits to pregnant women and newborns. CONCLUSIONS: Home isolation was hardly feasible in the rural Amazon context and community isolation was undermined by lack of external supplies and social support. With sustained community transmission, promotion of basic hygiene and mask use becomes essential. To avoid devastating effects on MNH, routine services at facilities need to be urgently re-established alongside COVID-19 preparedness plans. Community-based MNH programmes could offset detrimental indirect effects of the pandemic and provide an opportunity for local COVID-19 prevention and containment.","Reinders, Stefan; Alva, Angela; Huicho, Luis; Blas, Magaly M",BMJ Open,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33376182/; https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2020-044197,416

683963,Ability of procalcitonin to distinguish between bacterial and nonbacterial infection in severe acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary syndrome in the ICU,2021-03-06,"BACKGROUND: Mucosal immunity, including secretory IgA (sIgA), plays an important role in early defenses against respiratory pathogens. Salivary testing, the most convenient way to measure sIgA, has been used to characterize mucosal immune responses to many viral infections including SARS, MERS, influenza, HIV, and RSV. However, its role has not yet been characterized in the COVID-19 pandemic. Here, we report development and validation of a rapid immunoassay for measuring salivary IgA against the SARS-CoV-2 virus, and report quantitative results in both pre-COVID-19 and muco-converted subjects. METHODS: We developed and refined a specific test for salivary IgA against SARS-CoV-2 on the Brevitest platform, a rapid immunoassay system designed for point-of-care use. A qualitative test was validated as per FDA guidelines with saliva obtained from subjects prior to the emergence of COVID-19, and from PCR-confirmed COVID-19 patients. We also generated a quantitative measure of anti-SARS-CoV-2 salivary IgA. Time taken for saliva self-collection was measured and its ease-of-use assessed. RESULTS: We successfully validated a qualitative salivary assay for SARS-CoV-2 IgA antibodies, with positive and negative predictive values of 92% and 97%, respectively, and no observable cross-reactivity with any of seven potential confounders. Pre-COVID-19 saliva samples showed an 8-fold range of IgA concentrations, suggesting a broad continuum of natural antibody resistance against the novel virus, though at levels lower than that observed in COVID-19 PCR-confirmed subjects. Samples from muco-positive subjects also shown a ~9-fold variation in salivary IgA levels, with elevated salivary IgA observed beyond three months after onset of symptoms. We observed a correlation (r=0.4405) between salivary IgA levels and COVID-19 disease severity. In anecdotal observations, we observed individuals who exhibited antibodies early in the course of their disease, contemporaneously with a positive PCR test, as well as individuals who muco-converted despite no known direct exposure to a COVID-19 patient, no symptoms, and negative molecular and/or serum antibody tests. Salivary collection took 5–10 minutes, and was reported as being easy (mean of 1.1 on a scale of 1 to 10). IMPLICATIONS: Mucosal immunity, including secretory IgA, plays an important role in host defense against respiratory pathogens, and our early data suggest it may do so in COVID-19. Salivary IgA, an accessible marker of mucosal immunity, may be a useful indicator of several key parameters including individual and community immune response, disease severity, clinical risk, and herd immunity. The non-invasive nature and ease of saliva collection facilitates its potential use as a biomarker for ongoing patient assessment and management, as well as a community surveillance tool. By measuring mucosal immune responses directly and systemic immune responses indirectly, salivary IgA could be useful in developing and deploying a vaccine(s) against COVID-19. Quantitative IgA assessment could also potentially serve as a tool to segment the population into different risk categories and inform individual and collective decisions relating to appropriate activities and vaccine prioritization/delivery. These data reinforce the importance of further investigation into the role of mucosal immunity and IgA in host responses against COVID-19.","Varadhachary, Atul; Chatterjee, Dev; Garza, Javier; Garr, R.

Here, we analyse the viral genome on maternal and newborns nasopharyngeal swabs, vaginal swabs, maternal and umbilical cord plasma, placenta and umbilical cord biopsies, amniotic fluids and milk from 31 mothers with SARS-CoV-2 infection. In addition, we also test specific anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies and expression of genes involved in inflammatory responses in placentas, and in maternal and umbilical cord plasma. We detect SARS-CoV-2 genome in one umbilical cord blood and in two at-term placentas, in one vaginal mucosa and in one milk specimen. Furthermore, we report the presence of specific anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG antibodies in one umbilical cord blood and in one milk specimen. Finally, in the three documented cases of vertical transmission, SARS-CoV-2 infection was accompanied by a strong inflammatory response. Together, these data support the hypothesis that in utero SARS-CoV-2 vertical transmission, while low, is possible.

First, we are dealing with time-series data. Typical time-series data describe behavior of a single object over time. In medical data, we are dealing with time-series data belonging to multiple entities. Thus, there may be multiple subsets of records such that records in each subset, which belong to a single entity are temporally dependent, but the records in different subsets are unrelated. Moreover, the records in a subset contain different types of attributes, some of which must be grouped in a particular manner to make the analysis meaningful. Anomaly detection techniques need to be customized for time-series data belonging to multiple entities. Second, anomaly detection techniques fail to explain the cause of outliers to the experts. This is critical for new diseases and pandemics where current knowledge is insufficient. We propose to address these issues by extending our existing work called IDEAL, which is an LSTM-autoencoder based approach for data quality testing of sequential records, and provides explanations of constraint violations in a manner that is understandable to end-users. The extension (1) uses a novel two-level reshaping technique that splits COVID-19 data sets into multiple temporally-dependent subsequences and (2) adds a data visualization plot to further explain the anomalies and evaluate the level of abnormality of subsequences detected by IDEAL. We performed two systematic evaluation studies for our anomalous subsequence detection. One study uses aggregate data, including the number of cases, deaths, recovered, and percentage of hospitalization rate, collected from a COVID tracking project, New York Times, and Johns Hopkins for the same time period. The other study uses COVID-19 patient medical records obtained from Anschutz Medical Center health data warehouse. The results are promising and indicate that our techniques can be used to detect anomalies in large volumes of real-world unlabeled data whose accuracy or validity is unknown.","Homayouni, Hajar; Ray, Indrakshi; Ghosh, Sudipto; Gondalia, Shlok; Kahn, Michael G.",SN Comput Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34027432/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s42979-021-00658-w,416

METHODS: Our data were from network-based survey, and 17,876 participants completed the questionnaire. t test, one-way ANOVA and multiple linear regression model were performed using PANAS (Positive and Negative Affect Schedule) score as the dependent variable. RESULTS: Of 17,876 participants, the mean score of PA was 25.5 ± 7.3, while NA was 19.1 ± 7.1. Multiple linear regression models showed that there are some common determinants of PA and NA, such as education, health literacy on communicable diseases, satisfaction with measures for epidemic prevention and control, risk of infection, impact of the outbreak on daily life, sleep duration and frequency of hand washing in the past 2 weeks. Besides, whether the student is a medical major and whether outing in the past 2 weeks were specific determinants of PA, and frequency of masks wearing was specific determinant of NA.

I propose that the conditions under which it is rational to trust and defer to experts depend on the competences of the layperson and the expert, and the degree of interest alignment.

It is currently unknown if the experience of lockdown leads to long term changes in individual’s eating behaviors. The objectives of this study were: i) to derive longitudinal trajectories of change in eating during UK lockdown, and ii) to identify risk factors associated with eating behavior trajectories. Method Data from 22,374 UK adults from the UCL COVID-19 Social study (a panel study collecting weekly data during the pandemic) were analyzed from 28th March to 29th May 2020. Latent Class Growth Analysis was used to derive trajectories of change in eating. These were then associated with prior socio-economic, heath-related and psychological factors using multinomial regression models. Results Analyses suggested five trajectories, with the majority (64%) showing no change in eating. In contrast, one trajectory was marked by persistently eating more, whereas another by persistently eating less. Overall, participants with greater depressive symptoms were more likely to report any change in eating. Loneliness was linked to persistently eating more (OR= 1.07), whereas being single or divorced, as well as stressful life events, were associated with consistently eating less (OR= 1.69). Overall, higher education status was linked to lower odds of changing eating behavior (OR= 0.54-0.77). Secondary exploratory analyses suggest that participants self-reported to have overweight were most common amongst the consistently overeaters, whereas underweight participants persistently ate less. Conclusion In this study, we found that one third of the sample report changes in quantities eaten throughout the first UK lockdown period. Findings highlight the importance of adjusting public health programs to support eating behaviors in future lockdowns both in this and potential future pandemics.

The entry process involves priming of the S protein by TMPRSS2 and ADAM17, which collectively mediate the binding and promote ACE2 shedding. In this study, microarray and RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) expression data were utilized to profile the expression pattern of ACE2, ADAM17, and TMPRSS2 in type 2 diabetic (T2D) and non-diabetic human pancreatic islets. Our data show that pancreatic islets express all three receptors irrespective of diabetes status. The expression of ACE2 was significantly increased in diabetic/hyperglycemic islets compared to non-diabetic/normoglycemic. Islets from female donors showed higher ACE2 expression compared to males; the expression of ADAM17 and TMPRSS2 was not affected by gender. The expression of the three receptors was statistically similar in young (≤40 years old) versus old (≥60 years old) donors. Obese (BMI > 30) donors have significantly higher expression levels of ADAM17 and TMPRSS2 relative to those from non-obese donors (BMI < 25). TMPRSS2 expression correlated positively with HbA1c and negatively with age, while ADAM17 and TMPRSS2 correlated positively with BMI. The expression of the three receptors was statistically similar in muscle and subcutaneous adipose tissues obtained from diabetic and nondiabetic donors. Lastly, ACE2 expression was higher in sorted pancreatic β-cell relative to other endocrine cells. In conclusion, ACE2 expression is increased in diabetic human islets. More studies are required to investigate whether variations of ACE2 expression could explain the severity of COVID-19 infection-related symptoms between diabetics and non-diabetic patients.","Taneera, Jalal; El-Huneidi, Waseem; Hamad, Mawieh; Mohammed, Abdul Khader; Elaraby, Esraa; Hachim, Mahmood Yaseen",Biology (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32784802/; https://doi.org/10.3390/biology9080215,416
