A Multiple-Case Study",2020-05-09,"The current problem of increasing antibiotic resistance and the resurgence of numerous infections indicate the need for novel vaccination strategies more than ever. In vaccine development, the search for and the selection of adequate vaccine antigens is the first important step. In recent years, bacterial outer membrane proteins have become of major interest, as they are the main proteins interacting with the extracellular environment. Trimeric autotransporter adhesins (TAAs) are important virulence factors in many Gram-negative bacteria, are localised on the bacterial surface, and mediate the first adherence to host cells in the course of infection. One example is the Neisseria adhesin A (NadA), which is currently used as a subunit in a licensed vaccine against Neisseria meningitidis. Other TAAs that seem promising vaccine candidates are the Acinetobacter trimeric autotransporter (Ata), the Haemophilus influenzae adhesin (Hia), and TAAs of the genus Bartonella. Here, we review the suitability of various TAAs as vaccine candidates.","Thibau, Arno; Dichter, Alexander A.; Vaca, Diana J.; Linke, Dirk; Goldman, Adrian; Kempf, Volkhard A.

However, the neural mechanisms that coordinate these distinct motor programs remain poorly understood. Here, we examine how the distinct motor programs of the nematode C. elegans are coupled together across behavioral states. We describe a new imaging platform that permits automated, simultaneous quantification of each of the main C. elegans motor programs over hours or days. Analysis of these whole-organism behavioral profiles shows that the motor programs coordinately change as animals switch behavioral states. Utilizing genetics, optogenetics, and calcium imaging, we identify a new role for dopamine in coupling locomotion and egg-laying together across states. These results provide new insights into how the diverse motor programs throughout an organism are coordinated and suggest that neuromodulators like dopamine can couple motor circuits together in a state-dependent manner.","Cermak, Nathan; Yu, Stephanie K; Clark, Rebekah; Huang, Yung-Chi; Baskoylu, Saba N; Flavell, Steven W",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7347390/,625

An Italian Survey,2020-09-12,"In 2019, an ‘influenza pandemic’ and ‘vaccine hesitancy’ were listed as two of the top 10 challenges to global health by the WHO. The skin is a unique vaccination site, due to its immune-rich milieu, which is evolutionarily primed to respond to challenge, and its ability to induce both humoral and cellular immunity. Vaccination into this dermal compartment offers a way of addressing both of the challenges presented by the WHO, as well as opening up avenues for novel vaccine formulation and dose-sparing strategies to enter the clinic. This review will provide an overview of the diverse range of vaccination techniques available to target the dermal compartment, as well as their current state, challenges, and prospects, and touch upon the formulations that have been developed to maximally benefit from these new techniques. These include needle and syringe techniques, microneedles, DNA tattooing, jet and ballistic delivery, and skin permeabilization techniques, including thermal ablation, chemical enhancers, ablation, electroporation, iontophoresis, and sonophoresis.","Hettinga, Johanna; Carlisle, Robert",Vaccines (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7564253/,625

In a departure from the existing literature on carbon labeling that heavily relies on interviews or questionnaire surveys, this study forms a hybrid of an auction experiment and a consumption experiment to observe university students’ purchase intention and willingness to pay for a carbon-labeled food product. In this study, students from a university in a city (Chengdu) of China, the largest carbon emitter, are taken as the experimental group, and cow’s milk is selected as the experimental food product. The main findings of this study are summarized as follows: (1) the purchase of carbon-labeled milk products is primarily influenced by price; (2) the willingness to pay for carbon-labeled milk products primarily depends on the premium; and (3) the students are willing to accept a maximum price premium of 3.2%.

Recent studies support the notion that metabolic processes correlate with sleep. The study of metabolite biomarkers (metabolomics) in a large-scale manner offers unique opportunities to provide insights into the pathology of diseases by revealing alterations in metabolic pathways. This review aims to summarize the status of metabolomic analyses-based knowledge on sleep disorders and to present knowledge in understanding the metabolic role of sleep in psychiatric disorders. Overall, findings suggest that sleep-wake disorders lead to pronounced alterations in specific metabolic pathways, which might contribute to the association of sleep disorders with other psychiatric disorders and medical conditions. These alterations are mainly related to changes in the metabolism of branched-chain amino acids, as well as glucose and lipid metabolism. In insomnia, alterations in branched-chain amino acid and glucose metabolism were shown among studies. In obstructive sleep apnea, biomarkers related to lipid metabolism seem to be of special importance. Future studies are needed to examine severity, subtypes and treatment of sleep-wake disorders in the context of metabolite levels.","Humer, Elke; Pieh, Christoph; Brandmayr, Georg",Int J Mol Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7583860/,625
13486,Roma Health: An Overview of Communicable Diseases in Eastern and Central Europe,2020-10-20,"SIMPLE SUMMARY: How tourist camp activities affect individual elephant welfare is an important and highly debated topic. Saliva and fecal samples were collected monthly for 1 year from 44 female Asian elephants that participated in three programs (saddle-, bareback-, or no-riding), and analyzed for glucocorticoids (GC) and immunoglobulin A (IgA). The hypothesis was that better welfare would be associated with low GC and high IgA concentrations. Both biomarkers showed significant variation with respect to camp size, riding activities, tourist-to-elephant ratios and seasonality, but not always consistently between feces and saliva, and not always in the predicted direction. However, there was no clear indication that riding per se negatively affected these two biomarkers. The lack of consistent responses highlights the difficulty in interpreting physiological data in relation to management factors, and suggests more work is needed to differentiate between potential chronic (feces) and acute (saliva) responses. ABSTRACT: Asian elephants have been an important part of wildlife ecotourism in Thailand for over two decades. Elephants in tourist camps are exposed to a variety of management styles and daily activities that can potentially affect health and welfare. This study investigated relationships between a novel welfare biomarker, immunoglobulin A (IgA), and daily camp activities, and compared results to glucocorticoid (GC) measures. Often no-riding camps are portrayed as providing better welfare than camps that offer riding. Therefore, we predicted that elephants at no-riding camps would have lower GC and higher IgA concentrations, and a low GC/IgA ratio. Forty-four female elephants from six elephant camps were divided into three groups based on riding activities: saddle-riding, bareback-riding, and no-riding. Fecal and salivary samples were collected monthly for 1 year along with evaluations of body condition, foot health, and wounding. Camp environment and management varied among camps, although the major difference was in riding activities. Concentrations of GCs and IgA varied among the working groups, but not always consistently between sample matrices. Overall fecal glucocorticoid metabolite concentrations were lowest in the saddle-riding group. Only in one bareback-riding camp did the elephants exhibit a potentially positive welfare response with a low GC/IgA ratio over time. Other results varied between the two biomarkers, with considerable variability across camps, suggesting there is more to good welfare than whether elephants participate in riding or not. Several other human-induced stressors, like chaining, ankus use, and limited social opportunities are likely to be impacting well-being and should be considered to ensure management practices meet physical and psychological welfare needs.","Kosaruk, Worapong; Brown, Janine L.; Plangsangmas, Tithipong; Towiboon, Patcharapa; Punyapornwithaya, Veerasak; Silva-Fletcher, Ayona; Thitaram, Chatchote; Khonmee, Jaruwan; Edwards, Katie L.; Somgird, Chaleamchat",Animals (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7589861/,625

EVs have therefore attracted broad interest as new and refined potential therapeutic systems in many diseases, including cancer, due to their low immunogenicity, non-toxicity, and elevated bioavailability. They might serve as safe and effective vehicles for the transport of therapeutic molecules to specific tissues and cells. In this review, we focus on EVs as a vehicle for gene therapy in cancer.

13531,Well-Being at Work after Return to Work (RTW): A Systematic Review,2020-10-15,"SIMPLE SUMMARY: In our systematic review and meta-analysis of eight observational studies including a total of 1016 patients, we demonstrated excellent pooled inter-observer agreement among Genito-Urinary radiologists when adopting the novel Vesical Imaging-Reporting and Data System (VI-RADS) criteria in the pre-trans-urethral resection of bladder tumor (TURBT) assessment for non-muscle (NMIBC) vs. muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC) detection. ABSTRACT: The Vesical Imaging-Reporting and Data System (VI-RADS) has been introduced to provide preoperative bladder cancer staging and has proved to be reliable in assessing the presence of muscle invasion in the pre-TURBT (trans-urethral resection of bladder tumor). We aimed to assess through a systematic review and meta-analysis the inter-reader variability of VI-RADS criteria for discriminating non-muscle vs. muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC, MIBC). PubMed, Web of Science, Cochrane, and Embase were searched up until 30 July 2020. The Quality Appraisal of Diagnostic Reliability (QAREL) checklist was utilized to assess the quality of included studies and a pooled measure of inter-rater reliability (Cohen’s Kappa [κ] and/or Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs)) was calculated. Further sensitivity analysis, subgroup analysis, and meta-regression were conducted to investigate the contribution of moderators to heterogeneity. In total, eight studies between 2018 and 2020, which evaluated a total of 1016 patients via 21 interpreting genitourinary (GU) radiologists, met inclusion criteria and were critically examined. No study was considered to be significantly flawed with publication bias. The pooled weighted mean κ estimate was 0.83 (95%CI: 0.78–0.88). Heterogeneity was present among the studies (Q = 185.92, d.f. = 7, p < 0.001; I2 = 92.7%). Meta-regression analyses showed that the relative % of MIBC diagnosis and cumulative reader’s experience to influence the estimated outcome (Coeff: 0.019, SE: 0.007; p= 0.003 and 0.036, SE: 0.009; p = 0.001). In the present study, we confirm excellent pooled inter-reader agreement of VI-RADS to discriminate NMIBC from MIBC underlying the importance that standardization and reproducibility of VI-RADS may confer to multiparametric magnetic resonance (mpMRI) for preoperative BCa staging.","Del Giudice, Francesco; Pecoraro, Martina; Vargas, Hebert Alberto; Cipollari, Stefano; De Berardinis, Ettore; Bicchetti, Marco; Chung, Benjamin I.; Catalano, Carlo; Narumi, Yoshifumi; Catto, James W.

14089,Verification of the Mediating Effect of Social Support on Physical Activity and Aging Anxiety of Korean Pre-Older Adults,2020-11-02,"Polyethylene (PE) is one the most used plastics worldwide for a wide range of applications due to its good mechanical and chemical resistance, low density, cost efficiency, ease of processability, non-reactivity, low toxicity, good electric insulation, and good functionality. However, its high flammability and rapid flame spread pose dangers for certain applications. Therefore, different flame-retardant (FR) additives are incorporated into PE to increase its flame retardancy. In this review article, research papers from the past 10 years on the flame retardancy of PE systems are comprehensively reviewed and classified based on the additive sources. The FR additives are classified in well-known FR families, including phosphorous, melamine, nitrogen, inorganic hydroxides, boron, and silicon. The mechanism of fire retardance in each family is pinpointed. In addition to the efficiency of each FR in increasing the flame retardancy, its impact on the mechanical properties of the PE system is also discussed. Most of the FRs can decrease the heat release rate (HRR) of the PE products and simultaneously maintains the mechanical properties in appropriate ratios. Based on the literature, inorganic hydroxide seems to be used more in PE systems compared to other families. Finally, the role of nanotechnology for more efficient FR-PE systems is discussed and recommendations are given on implementing strategies that could help incorporate flame retardancy in the circular economy model.","Rezvani Ghomi, Erfan; Khosravi, Fatemeh; Mossayebi, Zahra; Saedi Ardahaei, Ali; Morshedi Dehaghi, Fatemeh; Khorasani, Masoud; Neisiany, Rasoul Esmaeely; Das, Oisik; Marani, Atiye; Mensah, Rhoda Afriyie; Jiang, Lin; Xu, Qiang; Försth, Michael; Berto, Filippo; Ramakrishna, Seeram",Molecules,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7664228/,625
14238,Relationship between Bell’s Palsy and Previous Statin Use: A Case/Non-Case Study,2020-11-13,"Oral vaccination is a practical method for the active immunization of farmed fish in the matter of animal welfare and handling costs. However, it always shows insufficient protective immunity, mainly due to antigen degradation in the gastrointestinal tract (GIT). Bacillus subtilis spores have been shown to be able to protect surface-display heterologous antigens against degradation. Neverthless, the spores can germinate in GIT, which causes loss of the antigens with spore coat disassembly. Here, we developed a novel surface display system using the B. subtilis spore coat proteins CotB and CotC as anchors for the heterogenous antigen, and the germination-controlling genes cwlJ and sleB as the ectopic integration sites for the fusion genes. Using this display system, we engineered germination-arrest spores displaying the model antigen Vp7 of grass carp reovirus (GCRV) on their surface. Oral vaccination of the engineered spores could confer immune protection against GCRV in grass carp (Ctenopharyngodon idella) via eliciting adaptive humoral and cellular immune responses. Most importantly, the germination-arrest spores were shown to significantly augment immunogenicity and protection above the engineered spores based on the existing surface display system. Therefore, the presently reported antigen expression strategy opens new and promising avenues for developing oral vaccines for the immunization of farmed fish species.","Sun, Rui; Zhang, Miao; Chen, Hui; Wei, Yao; Ning, Degang",Genes (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7696455/,625
14262,"Exploring Vector-Borne Disease Surveillance and Response Systems in Beijing, China: A Qualitative Study from the Health System Perspective",2020-11-17,"Introduction. The acquired muscle paralysis associated with modern critical care can be of neurogenic or myogenic origin, yet the distinction between these origins is hampered by the precision of current diagnostic methods. This has resulted in the pooling of all acquired muscle paralyses, independent of their origin, into the term Intensive Care Unit Acquired Muscle Weakness (ICUAW). This is unfortunate since the acquired neuropathy (critical illness polyneuropathy, CIP) has a slower recovery than the myopathy (critical illness myopathy, CIM); therapies need to target underlying mechanisms and every patient deserves as accurate a diagnosis as possible. This study aims at evaluating different diagnostic methods in the diagnosis of CIP and CIM in critically ill, immobilized and mechanically ventilated intensive care unit (ICU) patients. Methods. ICU patients with acquired quadriplegia in response to critical care were included in the study. A total of 142 patients were examined with routine electrophysiological methods, together with biochemical analyses of myosin:actin (M:A) ratios of muscle biopsies. In addition, comparisons of evoked electromyographic (EMG) responses in direct vs. indirect muscle stimulation and histopathological analyses of muscle biopsies were performed in a subset of the patients. Results. ICU patients with quadriplegia were stratified into five groups based on the hallmark of CIM, i.e., preferential myosin loss (myosin:actin ratio, M:A) and classified as severe (M:A < 0.5; n = 12), moderate (0.5 ≤ M:A < 1; n = 40), mildly moderate (1 ≤ M:A < 1.5; n = 49), mild (1.5 ≤ M:A < 1.7; n = 24) and normal (1.7 ≤ M:A; n = 19). Identical M:A ratios were obtained in the small (4–15 mg) muscle samples, using a disposable semiautomatic microbiopsy needle instrument, and the larger (>80 mg) samples, obtained with a conchotome instrument. Compound muscle action potential (CMAP) duration was increased and amplitude decreased in patients with preferential myosin loss, but deviations from this relationship were observed in numerous patients, resulting in only weak correlations between CMAP properties and M:A. Advanced electrophysiological methods measuring refractoriness and comparing CMAP amplitude after indirect nerve vs. direct muscle stimulation are time consuming and did not increase precision compared with conventional electrophysiological measurements in the diagnosis of CIM. Low CMAP amplitude upon indirect vs. direct stimulation strongly suggest a neurogenic lesion, i.e., CIP, but this was rarely observed among the patients in this study. Histopathological diagnosis of CIM/CIP based on enzyme histochemical mATPase stainings were hampered by poor quantitative precision of myosin loss and the impact of pathological findings unrelated to acute quadriplegia. Conclusion. Conventional electrophysiological methods are valuable in identifying the peripheral origin of quadriplegia in ICU patients, but do not reliably separate between neurogenic vs. myogenic origins of paralysis. The hallmark of CIM, preferential myosin loss, can be reliably evaluated in the small samples obtained with the microbiopsy instrument. The major advantage of this method is that it is less invasive than conventional muscle biopsies, reducing the risk of bleeding in ICU patients, who are frequently receiving anticoagulant treatment, and it can be repeated multiple times during follow up for monitoring purposes.","Marrero, Humberto D.J.

14272,Towards a New System for the Assessment of the Quality in Care Pathways: An Overview of Systematic Reviews,2020-11-20,"The sooner disruptive emergent behaviors are detected, the sooner preventive measures can be taken to ensure the resilience of business processes execution. Therefore, organizations need to prepare for emergent behaviors by embedding corrective control mechanisms, which help coordinate organization-wide behavior (and goals) with the behavior of local autonomous entities. Ongoing technological advances, brought by the Industry 4.0 and cyber-physical systems of systems paradigms, can support integration within complex enterprises, such as supply chains. In this paper, we propose a reference enterprise architecture for the detection and monitoring of emergent behaviors in enterprises. We focus on addressing the need for an adequate reaction to disruptions. Based on a systematic review of the literature on the topic of current architectural designs for understanding emergent behaviors, we distill architectural requirements. Our architecture is a hybrid as it combines distributed autonomous business logic (expressed in terms of simple business rules) and some central control mechanisms. We exemplify the instantiation and use of this architecture by means of a proof-of-concept implementation, using a multimodal logistics case study. The obtained results provide a basis for achieving supply chain resilience “by design”, i.e., through the design of coordination mechanisms that are well equipped to absorb and compensate for the effects of emergent disruptive behaviors.","Bemthuis, Rob; Iacob, Maria-Eugenia; Havinga, Paul",Sensors (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7700700/,625

In the medical and dental field, every patient is unique and, therefore, AM has significant potential in personalized and customized solutions. This review explores what additive manufacturing processes and materials are utilized in medical and dental applications, especially focusing on processes that are less commonly used. The processes are categorized in ISO/ASTM process classes: powder bed fusion, material extrusion, VAT photopolymerization, material jetting, binder jetting, sheet lamination and directed energy deposition combined with classification of medical applications of AM. Based on the findings, it seems that directed energy deposition is utilized rarely only in implants and sheet lamination rarely for medical models or phantoms. Powder bed fusion, material extrusion and VAT photopolymerization are utilized in all categories. Material jetting is not used for implants and biomanufacturing, and binder jetting is not utilized for tools, instruments and parts for medical devices. The most common materials are thermoplastics, photopolymers and metals such as titanium alloys. If standard terminology of AM would be followed, this would allow a more systematic review of the utilization of different AM processes.

One form of LSG is multifunctional autonomy, in which citizens can comprehensively manage their communities with government support. This study clarified the effect of multifunctional autonomy on healthy life expectancy by assessing related advantages and challenges in rural Japanese communities, using a mixed-methods approach. Disability-free life expectancy from 65 years (DFLE-65) was assessed to compare healthy life expectancies between two rural Japanese cities (with/without multifunctional autonomy). Comparisons revealed better DFLE-65 only among older men in a city with multifunctional autonomy. A cost-effectiveness analysis investigated the relationship between the budget and DFLE-65 change using questionnaire data. Cost-effectiveness analysis of multifunctional autonomy indicated 61,147 yen/DFLE-65. Thematic analysis revealed that multifunctional autonomy created new roles for older men, improving community relationships. However, sustainable multifunctional autonomy in LSG communities may be hindered by a generally aging society, generation gap, and lack of mutual understanding between rural communities and local governments. To ensure the sustainability of multifunctional autonomy, collaborations between local communities and governments and among various generations are critical.","Ohta, Ryuichi; Ryu, Yoshinori; Kataoka, Daisuke; Sano, Chiaki",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7827779/,625

As erythropoietin (EPO) is emerging for its benefits in neurodegenerative diseases, here, we test the protective effect driven by EPO in in vitro (SH-SY5Y cells challenged by MPP(+)) and in vivo (C57BL/6J mice administered with MPTP) PD models. EPO restores cell viability in both protective and restorative layouts, enhancing the dopaminergic recovery. Specifically, EPO rescues the PD-induced damage to mitochondria, as shown by transmission electron microscopy, Mitotracker assay and PINK1 expression. Moreover, EPO promotes a rescue of mitochondrial respiration while markedly enhancing the glycolytic rate, as shown by the augmented extracellular acidification rate, contributing to elevated ATP levels in MPP(+)-challenged cells. In PD mice, EPO intrastriatal infusion markedly improves the outcome of behavioral tests. This is associated with the rescue of dopaminergic markers and decreased neuroinflammation. This study demonstrates cellular and functional recovery following EPO treatment, likely mediated by the 37 Kda isoform of the EPO-receptor. We report for the first time, that EPO-neuroprotection is exerted through restoring ATP levels by accelerating the glycolytic rate. In conclusion, the redox imbalance and neuroinflammation associated with PD may be successfully treated by EPO.","Rey, Federica; Ottolenghi, Sara; Giallongo, Toniella; Balsari, Alice; Martinelli, Carla; Rey, Robert; Allevi, Raffaele; Giulio, Anna Maria Di; Zuccotti, Gian Vincenzo; Mazzucchelli, Serena; Foresti, Roberta; Samaja, Michele; Carelli, Stephana",Antioxidants (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7830512/,625

Ideally a physical activity intervention may be considered actually efficacious when it outgrows the research setting and becomes embedded in a system, ensuring maintenance and sustainability of its health benefits. Physicians need specific skills to improve patients’ exercise habits. These range from traditional clinical competencies, to technical competencies to correctly prescribe exercise, to competencies in behavioral medicine to motivate the subject. From a behavioral and medical point of view, an exercise prescription may be considered correct only if the subject actually performs the prescribed exercise and this results in an improvement of physiological mechanisms such as endocrine, immunological and autonomic controls. Here we describe a model of intervention intended to nurture exercise prescription in everyday clinical setting.

Currently, there are two classes of antiviral drugs available that are chemosynthetic and approved against influenza A virus for prophylactic and therapeutic treatment, but the appearance of drug-resistant virus strains is a serious issue that strikes at the core of influenza control. There is therefore an urgent need to develop new antiviral drugs. Many reports have shown that the development of novel bioactive plant extracts and microbial extracts has significant advantages in influenza treatment.

The contribution of patients’ dispositional optimism on caregiver burden is a poorly investigated topic. The present study aimed at investigating whether older adults’ multidimensional frailty and optimism might contribute to the burden of their family caregivers. The Caregiver Burden Inventory was used to measure the care-related burden of caregivers. The multidimensional frailty status of each patient was evaluated by calculating a frailty index, and the revised Life Orientation Test was used to evaluate patients’ dispositional optimism. The study involved eighty family caregivers (mean age 64.28 ± 8.6) and eighty older patients (mean age 80.45 ± 7.13). Our results showed that higher frailty status and lower levels of optimism among patients were significantly associated with higher levels of overall burden and higher burden related to the restriction of personal time among caregivers. Patients’ frailty was additionally associated with caregivers’ greater feelings of failure, physical stress, role conflicts, and embarrassment.

Additionally, GSEA exhibited an overrepresentation of circadian clock and antiaging signaling gene sets by melatonin derivatives and upregulation of extension of telomere signaling in HEKs, which was subsequently confirmed by increased telomerase activity in keratinocytes, indicating possible antiaging properties of metabolites of melatonin. Furthermore, Gene Ontology (GO) showed the activation of a keratinocyte differentiation program by melatonin, and GSEA indicated antitumor and antilipidemic potential of melatonin and its metabolites. IPA also indicated the role of Protein Kinase R (PKR) in interferon induction and antiviral response. In addition, the test compounds decreased lactate dehydrogenase A (LDHA) and lactate dehydrogenase C (LDHC) gene expression. These results were validated by qPCR and by Seahorse metabolic assay with significantly decreased glycolysis and lactate production under influence of AFMK or 6(OH)Mel in cells with a low oxygen consumption rate. In summary, melatonin and its metabolites affect keratinocytes’ functions via signaling pathways that overlap for each tested molecule with some distinctions.","Stefan, Joanna; Kim, Tae-Kang; Schedel, Fiona; Janjetovic, Zorica; Crossman, David K.; Steinbrink, Kerstin; Slominski, Radomir M.; Zmijewski, Jaroslaw; Tulic, Meri K.; Reiter, Russel J.; Kleszczyński, Konrad; Slominski, Andrzej T.",Antioxidants (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8073250/,625
17478,Walkability and Greenness Do Not Walk Together: Investigating Associations between Greenness and Walkability in a Large Metropolitan City Context,2021-04-21,"Sleep is very important for overall health and quality of life, while sleep disorder has been associated with several human diseases, namely cardiovascular, metabolic, cognitive, and cancer-related alterations. Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is the most common respiratory sleep-disordered breathing, which is caused by the recurrent collapse of the upper airway during sleep. OSA has emerged as a major public health problem and increasing evidence suggests that untreated OSA can lead to the development of various diseases including neurodegenerative diseases. In addition, OSA may lead to decreased blood oxygenation and fragmentation of the sleep cycle. The formation of free radicals or reactive oxygen species (ROS) can emerge and react with nitric oxide (NO) to produce peroxynitrite, thereby diminishing the bioavailability of NO. Hypoxia, the hallmark of OSA, refers to a decline of tissue oxygen saturation and affects several types of cells, playing cell-to-cell communication a vital role in the outcome of this interplay. Red blood cells (RBCs) are considered transporters of oxygen and nutrients to the tissues, and these RBCs are important interorgan communication systems with additional functions, including participation in the control of systemic NO metabolism, redox regulation, blood rheology, and viscosity. RBCs have been shown to induce endothelial dysfunction and increase cardiac injury. The mechanistic links between changes of RBC functional properties and cardiovascular are largely unknown. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are secreted by most cell types and released in biological fluids both under physiological and pathological conditions. EVs are involved in intercellular communication by transferring complex cargoes including proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids from donor cells to recipient cells. Advancing our knowledge about mechanisms of RBC-EVs formation and their pathophysiological relevance may help to shed light on circulating EVs and to translate their application to clinical practice. We will focus on the potential use of RBC-EVs as valuable diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers and state-specific cargoes, and possibilities as therapeutic vehicles for drug and gene delivery. The use of RBC-EVs as a precision medicine for the diagnosis and treatment of the patient with sleep disorder will improve the prognosis and the quality of life in patients with cardiovascular disease (CVD).","Khalyfa, Abdelnaby; Sanz-Rubio, David",Int J Mol Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8122484/,625
18210,Exploring the Association between Sleep Quality and Heart Rate Variability among Female Nurses,2021-05-22,"The aim of this scoping review is to synthesize the available evidence on the prevalence rates of healthcare workers being victims of violence perpetrated by patients and visitors in Italy. PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science and CINAHL were systematically searched from their inception to April 2021. Two authors independently assessed 1182 studies. All the scientific papers written in English or in Italian reporting primary quantitative and/or qualitative data on the prevalence of aggression or sexual harassment perpetrated by patients or visitors toward healthcare workers in Italy were included. Thirty-two papers were included in the review. The data extracted were summarized in a narrative synthesis organized in the following six thematic domains: (1). Methodology and study design; (2). Description of violent behavior; (3). Characteristics of health care staff involved in workplace violence (WPV); (4). Prevalence and form of WPV; (5). Context of WPV; and (6). Characteristics of violent patients and their relatives and/or visitors. The proportion of studies on WPV differed greatly across Italian regions, wards and professional roles of the healthcare workers. In general, the prevalence of WPV against healthcare workers in Italy is high, especially in psychiatric and emergency departments and among nurses and physicians, but further studies are needed in order to gather systematic evidence of this phenomenon. In Italy, and worldwide, there is an urgent need for governments, policy-makers and health institutions to prevent, monitor and manage WPV towards healthcare professionals.","Civilotti, Cristina; Berlanda, Sabrina; Iozzino, Laura",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8198045/,625

In this study, we revealed that cyclovirobuxine D (CVB-D), a natural compound derived from Buxus microphylla, was able to provoke mitophagy in lung cancer cells. CVB-D-induced mitophagy potentiates apoptosis by promoting mitochondrial dysfunction. Mechanistically, CVB-D initiates mitophagy by enhancing the expression of the mitophagy receptor BNIP3 and strengthening its interaction with LC3 to provoke mitophagy. Our results further showed that p65, a transcriptional suppressor of BNIP3, is downregulated upon CVB-D treatment. The ectopic expression of p65 inhibits BNIP3 expression, while its knockdown significantly abolishes its transcriptional repression on BNIP3 upon CVB-D treatment. Importantly, nude mice bearing subcutaneous xenograft tumors presented retarded growth upon CVB-D treatment. Overall, we demonstrated that CVB-D treatment can provoke mitophagy and further revealed that the p65/BNIP3/LC3 axis is one potential mechanism involved in CVB-D-induced mitophagy in lung cancer cells, thus providing an effective antitumor therapeutic strategy for the treatment of lung cancer patients","Zeng, Cheng; Zou, Tingting; Qu, Junyan; Chen, Xu; Zhang, Suping; Lin, Zhenghong",Int J Mol Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8199090/,625

This study aimed to assess the effect of glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) and duration of diabetes on lung function in type 2 diabetic patients and assess whether duration or high HbA1c is more noxious to damage the lung functions. A total of 202 participants, 101 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), and 101 age-, gender-, height-, and weight-matched controlled subjects were recruited. The HbA1c was measured through a clover analyzer, and lung function test parameters were recorded by spirometry. The results revealed a significant inverse correlation between HbA1c and Vital Capacity (VC) (r = −0.221, p = 0.026), Forced Vital Capacity (FVC) (r = −0.261, p = 0.008), Forced Expiratory Volume in First Second (FEV1) (r = −0.272, p = 0.006), Forced Expiratory Flow 25% (FEF-25%) (r = −0.196, p = 0.050), Forced Expiratory Flow 50% (FEF-50%) (r = −0.223, p = 0.025), and Forced Expiratory Flow 75% (FEF-75%) (r = −0.169, p = 0.016). Moreover, FEV1 (p = 0.029), FEV1/FVC% (p = 0.006), FEF-50% (p = 0.001), and FEF-75% (p = 0.003) were significantly lower in the diabetic group with duration of disease 5–10 and >10 years compared to the control group. The overall results concluded that high HbA1c or uncontrolled diabetes mellitus has a more damaging effect on lung function impairment compared to the duration of diabetes mellitus. Physicians must regularly monitor the HbA1c level while treating diabetic patients, as good glycemic control is essential to minimize the complications of DM, including lung function impairment in patients with T2DM.","Maan, Hawra Bin; Meo, Sultan Ayoub; Al Rouq, Fawziah; Meo, Imran Muhammad Umar; Gacuan, Milagros E.; Alkhalifah, Joud Mohammed",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8297156/,625
19384,Selected Approaches to the Assessment of Environmental Noise from Railways in Urban Areas,2021-07-02,"SIMPLE SUMMARY: Chronic heat-stress exposure directly affects broiler immune response. Immunosuppression was demonstrated in broiler exposed to chronic heat stress with deterioration in humoral and cell-mediated immune responses. Natural immune modulator material is considered as a safe material for human consumption of poultry products. Citrullus colocynthis (CC) is a natural herb plant that has traditionally been used in folk remediation. Anti-diabetic, antioxidant, and anti-inflammatory attributes are some of the CC medical properties. The present study aims to investigate the immune modulator potentials of CC seeds supplementation to chronically heat- stressed-exposed broilers. Results demonstrated that CC seeds supplementation to heat-stressed broilers was able to alleviate the negative impacts of heat stress on broiler immune responses and antioxidant status. Thus, CC seeds are suggested to be added to broilers reared under heat stress in order to improve the immune response and consequently ameliorate productivity. ABSTRACT: There is an extensive search for natural products that can be introduced to broiler rations to improve performance, especially during the unfavorable breeding conditions. Under heat-stress conditions, the immune response seriously deteriorates, which consequently impairs broiler production performance. Thus, the present study aimed to investigate the potentials of Citrullus colocynthis seeds (CCs) supplementation to modulate the immune response of broilers subjected to chronic heat stress. A total of 300 Cobb-500 male broiler chickens aged 21 days were randomly divided into two equal groups and reared under either thermo-neutral condition (24 ± 1 °C) or subjected to cyclic heat stress (34 ± 1 °C for 8 h). Each group was further divided into two groups (5 replicate × 15 chicks) and was fed either the basal diet or the basal diet with 0.1% CCs supplementation. The results showed that heat stress impaired the production performance by lowering the final body weight and feed intake as well as impairing feed conversion. The levels of stress markers (i.e., malondialdehyde, tumor necrosis factor-α and corticosterone) increased (p < 0.05), whereas the activity of antioxidant enzymes decreased in broilers exposed to heat stress. Further, heat stress caused direct suppression of broiler humoral and cell-mediated immune responses. The stimulating index of T and B lymphocytes proliferation, as well as the antibody titer against sheep red blood cells, were significantly (p < 0.05) reduced by heat-stress exposure. However, CCs supplementation to broilers subjected to heat stress improved (p < 0.05) the final body weight, feed intake, and feed conversion ratio (FCR), compared to the non-supplemented stressed group. The cellular and cell-mediated immune response indicators significantly enhanced (p < 0.05) with CCs supplementation. Supplementation of CCs to broilers reared under similar environmental conditions elevated the total white blood cells (TWBCs) count and the broiler stimulating index of T and B lymphocytes. It can be concluded that CC seeds can be effectively used to stimulate the immune response and improve the production performance of broilers reared under heat-stress condition.","Alzarah, Mohamed I.; Althobiati, Fayez; Abbas, Ahmed O.; Mehaisen, Gamal M.

19828,Health Literacy and Frailty in Community-Dwelling Older Adults: Evidence from a Nationwide Cohort Study in South Korea,2021-07-27,"Anaphylaxis is a severe, acute, life-threatening multisystem allergic reaction resulting from the release of a plethora of mediators from mast cells culminating in serious respiratory, cardiovascular and mucocutaneous manifestations that can be fatal. Medications, foods, latex, exercise, hormones (progesterone), and clonal mast cell disorders may be responsible. More recently, novel syndromes such as delayed reactions to red meat and hereditary alpha tryptasemia have been described. Anaphylaxis manifests as sudden onset urticaria, pruritus, flushing, erythema, angioedema (lips, tongue, airways, periphery), myocardial dysfunction (hypovolemia, distributive or mixed shock and arrhythmias), rhinitis, wheezing and stridor. Vomiting, diarrhea, scrotal edema, uterine cramps, vaginal bleeding, urinary incontinence, dizziness, seizures, confusion, and syncope may occur. The traditional (or classical) pathway is mediated via T cells, Th2 cytokines (such as IL-4 and 5), B cell production of IgE and subsequent crosslinking of the high affinity IgE receptor (FcεRI) on mast cells and basophils by IgE-antigen complexes, culminating in mast cell and basophil degranulation. Degranulation results in the release of preformed mediators (histamine, heparin, tryptase, chymase, carboxypeptidase, cathepsin G and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), and of de novo synthesized ones such as lipid mediators (cysteinyl leukotrienes), platelet activating factor (PAF), cytokines and growth factors such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Of these, histamine, tryptase, cathepsin G, TNF-α, LTC(4), PAF and VEGF can increase vascular permeability. Recent data suggest that mast cell-derived histamine and PAF can activate nitric oxide production from endothelium and set into motion a signaling cascade that leads to dilatation of blood vessels and dysfunction of the endothelial barrier. The latter, characterized by the opening of adherens junctions, leads to increased capillary permeability and fluid extravasation. These changes contribute to airway edema, hypovolemia, and distributive shock, with potentially fatal consequences. In this review, besides mechanisms (endotypes) underlying IgE-mediated anaphylaxis, we also provide a brief overview of IgG-, complement-, contact system-, cytokine- and mast cell-mediated reactions that can result in phenotypes resembling IgE-mediated anaphylaxis. Such classifications can lead the way to precision medicine approaches to the management of this complex disease.","Nguyen, Samantha Minh Thy; Rupprecht, Chase Preston; Haque, Aaisha; Pattanaik, Debendra; Yusin, Joseph; Krishnaswamy, Guha",Int J Mol Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8346007/,625

Indeed, apart from EVs secreted by blood cells, EVs of diverse origins travel in the bloodstream. We present the numerous types of EVs that have been found in circulation. Besides, the implications of blood-derived EVs in both physiological and pathological processes are summarized, highlighting their potential as biomarkers for the diagnosis, treatment monitoring, and prognosis of several diseases, and also as indicators of physiological modifications. Finally, the applications of EVs introduced in the circulatory system are discussed. We describe the use of EVs from distinct origins, naturally produced or engineered, autologous, allogeneic, or even from different species and the effects they have when introduced in circulation. Therefore, the present work provides a comprehensive overview of the components, effects, and applications of EVs in blood.","Alberro, Ainhoa; Iparraguirre, Leire; Fernandes, Adelaide; Otaegui, David",Int J Mol Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8347110/,625

Data from hospital admissions in mainland Portugal from 2008 to 2017 were used to forecast inpatient hospital admissions for March to May 2020. The observed number of hospitalizations and their characteristics were compared to forecasted values. Variations were compared by hospital and region. Statistical analysis was used to investigate whether patterns of variations existed according to hospital characteristics. There were 119,315 fewer hospitalizations than expected during March to May 2020 in Portugal, which represented a 57% reduction. Non-COVID-19 hospitalizations had a higher mean length of stay and proportion of inpatient deaths than forecasted values. Differences between observed and forecasted values varied greatly among regions and hospitals. These variations were not associated with COVID-19 hospital admissions, region, forecasted number of hospitalizations, type of hospital, or occupation rate. The impact on inpatient hospital admissions for each hospital was not consistent or proportional to the expected use across Portugal, as indicated by variations between forecasted and observed values.

56100,Athletic Identity in Youth Athletes: A Systematic Review of the Literature,2021-07-08,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Currently, there is a large body of research on multi-agent systems addressing their different system theoretic aspects. Aerial swarms as one type of multi-agent robotic systems have recently gained huge interest due to their potential applications. However, aerial robot groups are complex multi-disciplinary systems and usually research works focus on specific system aspects for particular applications. The purpose of this review is to provide an overview of the main motivating applications that drive the majority of research works in this field, and summarize fundamental and common algorithmic components required for their development. RECENT FINDINGS: Most system demonstrations of current aerial swarms are based on simulations, some have shown experiments using few 10 s of robots in controlled indoor environment, and limited number of works have reported outdoor experiments with small number of autonomous aerial vehicles. This indicates scalability issues of current swarm systems in real world environments. This is mainly due to the limited confidence on the individual robot’s localization, swarm-level relative localization, and the rate of exchanged information between the robots that is required for planning safe coordinated motions. SUMMARY: This paper summarizes the main motivating aerial swarm applications and the associated research works. In addition, the main research findings of the core elements of any aerial swarm system, state estimation and mission planning, are also presented. Finally, this paper presents a proposed abstraction of an aerial swarm system architecture that can help developers understand the main required modules of such systems.","Abdelkader, Mohamed; Güler, Samet; Jaleel, Hassan; Shamma, Jeff S.",Curr Robot Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8294305/,625

METHODS The guideline committee comprised local gastroenterologists from public and private sectors with particular expertise in aspects of HRM and PHM, and it was tasked to produce evidence-based statements on the indications, performance and reporting of these tests. Each committee member performed literature searches to retrieve relevant articles within the context of domains to which they were assigned. RESULTS Twelve recommendation statements were created and summarised. CONCLUSION Standardising key aspects of HRM and PHM is imperative to ensure the delivery of high-quality care. We reported the development of recommendations for the performance and interpretation of HRM and ambulatory reflux monitoring in Singapore.","Ong, Andrew Ming Liang; Soh, Alex Yu Sen; Wang, Yu Tien; Wong, Reuben K; Chia, Christopher Tze Wei; Siah, Kewin; Ang, Daphne","Annals of the Academy of Medicine, Singapore",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34472558/,625

On physical examination, a 10-cm-diameter, ulcerated, round, firm, and pigmented mass at the level of the left maxillary canine tooth was noticed. All other organ systems examined were within normal limits. Multiple biopsies of the mass were collected and fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin. Histopathologic evaluation of the biopsies revealed a malignant dermal melanoma. Hematologic and plasma biochemical parameters were within normal reference ranges. Thoracic radiographs taken 3 days following initial presentation showed no evidence of metastasis of the tumor. Computed tomography of the skull and neck was performed to evaluate local tumor invasion and to plan for hypofractionated radiation therapy. Therapy included four weekly treatments of 8 gray external-beam hypofractionated radiation and four bimonthly immunotherapy treatments. Following this treatment regime, the tumor size was reduced by 50%, and surgical excision was performed. No major side effects associated with radiation or immunotherapy were seen. Six months after diagnosis, hematologic and plasma biochemical parameters were within normal limits, thoracic radiographs showed no evidence of metastasis, and the lion showed no clinical signs of disease. The lion will continue to receive immunotherapy every 6 mo for the rest of its life. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first report of a successful treatment of a malignant dermal melanoma with external-beam hypofractionated radiation, immunotherapy, and surgical excision in an African lion.","Steeil, James C; Schumacher, Juergen; Baine, Katherine; Ramsay, Edward C; Sura, Patricia; Hodshon, Rebecca; Donnell, Robert L; Lee, Nathan D",Journal of zoo and wildlife medicine : official publication of the American Association of Zoo Veterinarians,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24063101/,625

Given the role of CCR5 in immune cell migration and inflammation, we investigated the impact of CCR5 blockade via the CCR5-specific antibody leronlimab on clinical, immunological and virological parameters in patients with severe COVID-19 disease. METHODS: In March 2020, ten terminally-ill, critical COVID-19 patients received two doses of leronlimab via individual emergency use indication (EIND). We analyzed changes in clinical presentation, immune cell populations, inflammation as well as SARS-CoV-2 plasma viremia before and 14 days after treatment. RESULTS: Over the 14 day study period 6/10 patients survived, 2 extubated, and 1 patient was discharged. We observed complete CCR5 receptor occupancy in all donors by day 7. Compared to baseline, we observed a concomitant statistically significant reduction of plasma IL-6, restoration of the CD4/CD8 ratio, and resolution of SARS-CoV2 plasma viremia (pVL) compared to controls. Further, the increase in CD8% was inversely correlated with reduction in pVL (r = -0.77, p = 0.0013).

They are classified into two types: acute (<48 hours) and persistent (>48 hours). COVID-19 is the defining health crisis of our generation. Although there are common symptoms of the disease (e.g. fever, cough), several atypical presentations have appeared as the pandemic has evolved. Here, we present a patient with COVID-19 presenting with fever, sore throat, and persistent hiccups. METHODS AND RESULTS: A 48-year-old man presented to the hospital with a seven-day history of persistent hiccups, fever, and sore throat. Physical examination was unremarkable and abdominal ultrasound showed gaseous abdominal distension. Laboratory values were remarkable for elevated C-reactive protein, ferritin, and lactate dehydrogenase levels. Computed tomography of the chest showed bilateral subpleural areas of ground-glass attenuation and crazy-paving pattern. A COVID-19 test was positive, and hydroxychloroquine, oseltamivir, baclofen, and symptomatic treatment were initiated. The hiccups improved, and the patient was discharged home after ten days. CONCLUSION: Physicians should maintain a high level of suspicion and be aware of atypical presentations of COVID-19.","Bakheet, Nader; Fouad, Rabab; Kassem, Abdel Meguid; Hussin, Wessam; El-Shazly, Mostafa",Respiratory investigation (Online),,625

223496,"Knowledge, Attitudes, and Practices Related to COVID-19 Among Malawi Adults: A Community-Based Survey",2021,"COVID-19 can be divided into three clinical stages, and one can speculate that these stages correlate with where the infection resides. For the asymptomatic phase, the infection mostly resides in the nose where it elicits a minimal innate immune response. For the mildly symptomatic phase, the infection is mostly in the psuedostatified stratified epithelium of the larger airways and is accompanied by a more vigorous innate immune response. In the conducting airways, the epithelium can recover from the infection, because the keratin V basal cells are spared and they are the progenitor cells for the bronchial epithelium. There may be more severe disease in the respiratory bronchioles where the club cells are likely infected. The devastating third phase is in the gas exchange units of the lung, where ACE2 expressing alveolar type II cells and perhaps type I cells are infected. The loss of type II cells results in respiratory insufficiency due to the loss of pulmonary surfactant, alveolar flooding, and loss of normal repair, since type II cells are the progenitors of type I cells. The loss of type I and type II cells will also block normal active resorption of alveolar fluid. Subsequent endothelial damage leads to transudation of plasma proteins, formation of hyaline membranes, and an inflammatory exudate, characteristic of ARDS. Repair might be normal, but if the type II cells are severely damaged, alternative pathways for epithelial repair may be activated, which would result in some residual lung disease.","Mason, Robert J","Am. j. physiol., lung cell. mol. physiol",,625

We also analyze structures for glycoforms representing those present in the nascent glycoproteins (prior to enzymatic modifications in the Golgi), as well as those that are commonly observed on antigens present in other viruses. These models were subjected to molecular dynamics (MD) simulation to determine the extent to which glycan microheterogeneity impacts the antigenicity of the S glycoprotein. Lastly, we have identified peptides in the S glycoprotein that are likely to be presented in human leukocyte antigen (HLA) complexes, and discuss the role of S protein glycosylation in potentially modulating the innate and adaptive immune response to the SARS-CoV-2 virus or to a related vaccine. The 3D structures show that the protein surface is extensively shielded from antibody recognition by glycans, with the notable exception of the ACE2 receptor binding domain, and also that the degree of shielding is largely insensitive to the specific glycoform. Despite the relatively modest contribution of the glycans to the total molecular weight of the S trimer (17% for the HEK293 glycoform) they shield approximately 40% of the protein surface.","Grant, Oliver C; Montgomery, David; Ito, Keigo; Woods, Robert J",Sci Rep,,625

In a recent systematic review, it has been reported that isolated cases of Guillain-Barre Syndrome (GBS) have occurred secondary to COVID-19 infection. GBS is defined as a rare, but potentially fatal, immune mediated disease of peripheral nerves and nerve roots that is usually triggered by infections. The incidence of GBS can therefore increase during outbreaks of infectious diseases, as was seen during the Zika virus epidemics in 2013 in French Polynesia and 2015 in Latin America. While several cases of GBS secondary to COVID-19 infection have been reported in Italy, only one case has been reported in the United States (US). The reported case in the US was a 54- year old male.

The aim of the study was to assess the impact of a rehabilitation program at the Mental Health Support Centre in Tarnowskie Góry (Poland) on reducing severity of anxiety and depression symptoms, as well as improving overall quality of life during the COVID-19 pandemic. The study involved 35 patients, examined with an authors' questionnaire on sociodemographic data, the Hospital Scale of Anxiety and Depression (HADS) and the Short Form Health Survey (SF-36). Data was obtained during the first national lockdown and compared to data gathered before the pandemic on the same study group. Imposed restrictions, negative emotional state during lockdown, subjectively assessed higher health risk and a low level of knowledge about the COVID-19 pandemic did not significantly correlate with a severity of depression and anxiety, as well as general quality of life. However, the comparison of the results obtained in HADS and SF-36 scales show a significant improvement in both categories. Rehabilitation activities, including physical training, cognitive exercise and social therapy, reduce the severity of the symptoms and have a positive effect on the overall quality of life in patients suffering from schizophrenia and affective disorders. Therefore, holistic mental health support services may positively affect building an individual resilience.

The study aims to assess the associations of circadian rhythm abnormalities (CRA) during the COVID-19 outbreak with mental health in Chinese undergraduates. METHODS: A nationwide cross-sectional university-based survey was conducted from 4th February to 12th, 2020. Based on different geographical locations and purposive sampling approach, 19 universities from 16 provinces or municipalities in the mainland of China were selected. A total of 14,789 participants were recruited by using multistage stratified random sampling. The data of CRA were collected by self-reported questionnaires consist of four items involved rest-activity cycle, diet rhythm, wake up rhythm and sleep rhythm. The Patient Health Questionnaire and the Generalized Anxiety Disorder were applied to evaluate the symptoms of depression and anxiety. Chi-square test and ordinal logistic regression models were used to describe the distributions and associations of CRA and mental health. RESULTS: A total of 11,787 students [female: 6731(57.1%)] aged 15-26 years old (M = 20.45, SD = 1.76) were analyzed (response rate: 79.7%). The results showed the percentage of CRA were 17.5-28.7%. The prevalence of depression and anxiety were significantly higher in students with single CRA. Students who reported the coexistence of four CRA were more likely to be with the symptoms of depression (OR: 4.43, 95% CI: 3.91-5.03) and anxiety (OR: 3.11, 95% CI: 2.70-3.60).

Technology aimed to improve elder care and quality of life needs to focus in the early detection of decline, monitoring the functional evolution of the individuals and providing ways to foster physical activity, to recommend adequate nutritional habits and to control polypharmacy. But apart from all these core features, some other elements or modules covering disease-specific needs should be added to complement care. In the case of diabetes these functionalities could include control mechanisms for blood glucose and cardiovascular risk factors, specific nutritional recommendations, suited physical activity programs, diabetes-specific educational contents, and self-care recommendations. This research work focuses on those core aspects of the technology, leaving out disease-specific modules. These central technological components have been developed within the scope of two research and innovation projects (FACET and POSITIVE, funded by the EIT-Health), that revolve around the provision of integrated, continuous and coordinated care to frail older population, who are at a high risk of functional decline. Obtained results indicate that a geriatric multimodal intervention is effective for preventing functional decline and for reducing the use of healthcare resources if administered to diabetic pre-frail and frail older persons.

DESIGN: Repeated SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence study after the reopening of schools and 4 months later. SETTING: Secondary school in Dresden, Germany. PARTICIPANTS: 1538 students grades 8-12 and 507 teachers from 13 schools. INTERVENTIONS: Serial blood sampling and SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody assessment. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURE: Seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in study population. Number of undetected cases. RESULTS: 1538 students and 507 teachers were initially enrolled, and 1334 students and 445 teachers completed both study visits. The seroprevalence for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies was 0.6% in May/June and the same in September/October. Even in schools with reported COVID-19 cases before the lockdown of 13 March, no clusters could be identified. Of 12 persons with positive serology five had a known history of confirmed COVID-19; 23 out of 24 participants with a household history of COVID-91 were seronegative. CONCLUSIONS: Schools do not play a crucial role in driving the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in a low-prevalence setting. Transmission in families occurs very infrequently, and the number of unreported cases is low in this age group. These observations do not support school closures as a strategy fighting the pandemic in a low-prevalence setting.

266019,Pandemics and Burden of Stroke and Epilepsy in Sub-Saharan Africa: Experience from a Longstanding Health Programme,2021,"INTRODUCTION: Community pharmacists are often the first point of contact for the public, especially during pandemics. As outlined by the International Pharmaceutical Federation, community pharmacists have an important public health role during this Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) public health emergency. We therefore investigated the current practices, response preparedness and professional development needs of community pharmacists in Qatar. METHODOLOGY: A descriptive cross-sectional online 38-item questionnaire-based survey constructed on evidence-based public health roles of pharmacists was conducted between 28 May and 18 June 2020. Questions related to current practices required responses on a 5-point Likert-type scale ranging from ""always"" to ""never"". The questionnaire was evaluated for validity and the reliability analysis showed a Cronbach's alpha coefficient of 0.921. RESULTS: The response (n = 311) rate for the survey was 34.2%. More than 75% of pharmacists ""always"" encouraged and practiced hygiene and social distancing measures. On the other hand, the proportion of pharmacists ""always"" involved in patient assessment, education or providing information related to COVID-19 and application of evidence-based protocol ranged from 32 to 73%. The vast majority (87-96%) of pharmacists indicated that they needed professional development related to COVID-19. Overall, 77% of pharmacists either ""strongly agreed"" or ""agreed"" that they have all the necessary COVID-19 related emergency response preparedness and training. Country from which pharmacists obtained their first degree, and the type of pharmacy where they practice influenced their overall perception toward emergency response preparedness. CONCLUSIONS: Community pharmacists in Qatar are willing to receive additional training related to COVID-19 public health crisis despite being prepared to engage with patients.","ElGeed, Hager; Owusu, Yaw; Abdulrhim, Sara; Awaisu, Ahmed; Kattezhathu, Vyas S; Abdulrouf, Palli Valapila; Sankaralingam, Sowndramalingam",J Infect Dev Ctries,,625

Vaccines offer the best hope for controlling its deleterious effects, but not everybody is willing to be vaccinated, so it is important to explore variables that might predict vaccination willingness. The present study addressed this by drawing upon the Social Identity Approach, which posits that people's membership of social groups is consequential for their thoughts and behaviour. Specifically, it was predicted that people's strength of identification with their local community (a social group that came to particular prominence during the pandemic) would positively predict their willingness to engage in community-related prosocial normative behaviour (i.e., their perceived sense of duty, as a community member, to get vaccinated) and that this, in turn, would predict higher levels of vaccination willingness. Participants (N = 130) completed an online survey, which supported the hypothesized mediation model, even after controlling for subjective neighbourhood socio-economic status and age (two variables that are particularly likely to impact upon vaccination willingness). To our knowledge, this is the first study to apply Social Identity Approach principles to the study of COVID-19 vaccination willingness. The implications of the findings for governments' efforts to boost vaccine uptake are discussed.

However, the efficiency of this material is controversial. We aimed to investigate the efficiency of cloth masks in reducing transmission and contamination by droplets and aerosols for the general population and healthcare workers. Electronic databases were searched without year or language restrictions. Clinical and laboratorial studies were included. The risk of bias (RoB) was assessed using an adapted quality checklist for laboratory-based studies. ROBINS-I tool and Cochrane RoB 2.0 were used to evaluate non-randomized (n-RCT) and randomized clinical trials (RCT), respectively. The quality of the evidence was assessed through GRADE tool. From the eleven studies selected, eight were laboratory-based studies, one non-randomized and one RCT supported by laboratory data. Between the evaluated fabrics only three presented a filtration efficiency &gt; 90%. Hybrid of cotton/chiffon (95%CI 95.2 to 98.8), hybrid of cotton/silk (95%CI 92.2 to 95.8) and cotton quilt (95%CI 94.2 to 97.8). However, cloth masks are not recommended for healthcare workers. A meta-analysis was not feasible due to a high methodological heterogeneity. The overall quality of evidence ranged from very low to moderate. Despite the lower efficiency compared to medical masks, laboratorial results may underestimate the efficiency of cloth masks in real life. Cloth mask efficiency is higher when made of hybrid fabrics (cotton/chiffon, cotton/silk) and cotton quilt, mainly with multiple layers.","Santos, Milena; Torres, Darlyane; Cardoso, Paula Coutinho; Pandis, Nikolaos; Flores-Mir, Carlos; Medeiros, Rita; Normando, Antonio David",Braz. oral res.

283788,"Insomnia in Relation to Academic Performance, Self-Reported Health, Physical Activity, and Substance Use Among Adolescents",2020,"OBJECTIVE: SARS CoV-2 is an epidemic viral infection that can cause mild to severe lung involvement. Newly apprehended knowledge on thoracic imaging abnormalities and the growing clinical experience on the evolution of this disease make the radiographic follow-up of hospitalized patients relevant. The value of consecutive bedside lung ultrasonography in the follow-up of hospitalized patients with SARS CoV-2 pneumonia and its correlation with other clinical and laboratory markers needs to be evaluated. METHODS: We assessed 39 patients [age: 64 y(60.1-68.7)] with confirmed SARS CoV-2 pneumonia. A total of 24 patients were hospitalized until the follow-up test, 9 were discharged early and 6 required a transfer to critical care unit. Two ultrasound scans of the lung were performed on day 1 and 4 of patients' hospitalization. Primary endpoint was the magnitude of association between a global lung ultrasound score (LUS) and clinical and laboratory markers. Secondary endpoint was the association between the evolution of LUS with the corresponded changes in clinical and laboratory outcomes during hospitalization period. RESULTS: LUS score on admission was higher among the deteriorating patients and significantly (P=0.038-0.0001) correlated (Spearman's rho) with the levels of C-reactive protein (0.58), lymphocytes (-0.33), SpO2 (-0.48) and oxygen supplementation (0.48) upon admission. The increase in LUS score between the two scans was significantly correlated (0.544, P=0.006) with longer hospital stay. CONCLUSION: Lung ultrasound assessment can be a useful as an imaging modality for SARS CoV-2 patients. Larger studies are needed to further investigate the predictive role of LUS in the duration and the outcome of the hospitalization of these patients.","Kalkanis, A; Wauters, E; Testelmans, D; Yserbyt, J; Lorent, N; Louvaris, Z; Godinas, L; Van Mol, P; Wauters, J; Eleftheriou, M; Dooms, C",Respir Med Res,,625

Controlling for interventions and ecological factors, we used linear regression to quantify testing's impact on COVID-19's average reproduction number, representing transmissibility, in 173 countries and territories, accounting for 99% of the world's COVID-19 cases, during March to June 2020. Amongst interventions, PCR testing had the greatest influence-a ten-fold increase in the ratio of tests to new cases reported reduced the average reproduction number by 9% across a range of testing levels. Our results imply that mobility reductions (e.g., shelter-in-place orders) were less effective in developing countries than in developed countries. Our results help explain how some nations achieved near-elimination of COVID-19 and the failure of lockdowns to slow COVID-19 in others. Our findings suggest that World Health Organization and other testing benchmarks are insufficient for COVID-19 control. Increased testing and isolation may represent the most effective, least costly alternative in terms of money, economic growth and human life for controlling COVID-19.

The World Health Organization estimates vaccines have saved more lives than any other interventions and every year about two to three million deaths are averted worldwide through immunization. To improve vaccination coverage, pharmacists have been increasingly involved in immunization roles in their communities-as advocates, educators, and immunizers. Community pharmacy-based vaccination services have increased both in the number of immunization providers and the number of sites where patients can receive immunizations. In Canada, health care is under provincial legislation-and so, there are distinct differences in scope of pharmacist practice across the country. Prior to the COVID-19 outbreak in early 2020, in Québec, Canada's second-largest province, pharmacists did not have the authority to administer vaccines. To help prepare pharmacists in Québec to become immunizers, we developed and deployed a series of accredited workshops. In these facilitated workshops, pharmacists were able to share best practices that may lead to providing effective vaccination services, identify common competency gaps, discuss effective patient communication skills, and determine how to target the most vulnerable population groups. Participants were also asked to evaluate the workshop. Our results indicate the evaluation was very reliable in measuring participant satisfaction (Cronbach's &#945; = 0.94) and pharmacists commented that the workshops' learning outcomes exceeded their expectations, and the topics covered were relevant and applicable. The evaluation also asked participants to identify weaknesses of training, so future educational interventions can be planned accordingly. We believe this work will contribute to the continual growth and advancement of the pharmacy profession in Canada.","Srirangan, Kajan; Lavenue, Arnaud",,,625

Therefore, the current study aimed to determine different patterns of syndromic symptoms and sensitivity and specificity of each of them in the diagnosis of COVID-19 in suspected patients. STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional study . METHODS: In this study, the retrospective data of 1,539 patients suspected of COVID-19 were obtained from a local registry under the supervision of the officials at Shahroud University of Medical Sciences, Shahroud, Iran. A Latent Class Analysis (LCA) was carried out on syndromic symptoms, and the associations of some risk factors and latent subclasses were accessed using one-way analysis of variance and Chi-square test. RESULTS: The LCA indicated that there were three distinct subclasses of syndromic symptoms among the COVID-19 suspected patients. The age, former smoking status, and body mass index were associated with the categorization of individuals into different subclasses. In addition, the sensitivity and specificity of class 2 (labeled as ""High probability of polymerase chain reaction [PCR]+"") in the diagnosis of COVID-19 were 67.43% and 76.17%, respectively. Furthermore, the sensitivity and specificity of class 3 (labeled as ""Moderate probability of PCR+"") in the diagnosis of COVID-19 were 75.92% and 50.23%, respectively.

308479,The Perceived Impact of COVID-19 among Treatment-Seeking Smokers: A Mixed Methods Approach,2021,"The article considers the dynamics of the TV and Internet consumption of different cohorts under the dramatic changes in the Russian media landscape In the last decade, the media environment has reached the mass scale in the use of the latest communication technologies based on the high-speed mobile Internet and its various apps The results of the comparison of the studies of 2012 and 2017 indicate multidirectional trends: an increase in the average daily time of the Internet use in the middle-age and partly elder cohorts, and a moderate increase in the younger groups The duration of TV viewing is a cyclic phenomenon determined by the stages of life cycle and socialization: the TV consumption of the same cohorts tends to decrease in a five-year interval According to the theory of media substitution, the Internet is partly a functional alternative to TV for it allows the needs of the audience to be more fully satisfied and to develop on the basis of new technological opportunities The article also considers features of the media consumption of the digital generation (millennials) This group is internally very different: it consists of several age and social-professional subgroups with serious differences in the average daily TV and Internet consumption All these trends of the media consumption changed under the covid-19 crisis: changes in the mode of life and a fundamentally different information agenda determined an increase in the media use, primarily TV and the Internet The long-term trend of the gradual decrease of the TV-audience changed: the average TV viewing increased in all cohorts Under the crisis, the leading functions of the media - information and recreation - are more in demand than before","Nazarov, M.

308754,A Study of Older Adults' Mental Health across 33 Countries during the COVID-19 Pandemic,2021,"The Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 has resulted in a global health emergency with major social and economic disruption. With no effective treatment or vaccine available, and given the ease of transmission, it becomes critical to develop rapid diagnostic and tracer methodologies, while working to understand how the virus causes critically severe disease in about 5% of those affected. Clinical and translational research of patients impacted by COVID-19 is essential, and in this commentary, the focus is on the use of serology testing as a proxy for infection to better understand risk for health complications, and tailor treatment and vaccine immunization to high-risk groups. The rationale for studying pediatric patients is that there is a paucity of research in this vulnerable population and children have fewer co-morbidities, but similar health disparities and disease complications as compared to adults. Asymptomatic children could also transmit the virus to others within their households and communities;thus, knowledge of their rate of infection is important to help mitigate spread and a possible second wave of infection. © 2020, Delaware Academy of Medicine.

Although recent reports suggest that lopinavir exhibits in vitro efficacy against SARS-CoV-2, it is a highly protein-bound drug and it remains unknown if it reaches adequate in vivo unbound (free) concentrations in lung tissue. We built a physiologically-based pharmacokinetic model of lopinavir/ritonavir in white and Chinese populations. Our aim was to perform pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic correlations by comparing simulated free plasma and lung concentration values achieved using different dosing regimens of lopinavir/ritonavir with unbound half-maximal effective concentration (EC50,unbound ) and unbound effective concentration 90% values of lopinavir against SARS-CoV-2. The model was validated against multiple observed clinical datasets for single and repeated dosing of lopinavir/ritonavir. Predicted pharmacokinetic parameters, such as the maximum plasma concentration, area under the plasma concentration-time profile, oral clearance, half-life, and minimum plasma concentration at steady-state were within two-fold of clinical values for both populations. Using the current lopinavir/ritonavir regimen of 400/100 mg twice daily, lopinavir does not achieve sufficient free lung concentrations for efficacy against SARS-CoV-2. Although the Chinese population reaches greater plasma and lung concentrations as compared with whites, our simulations suggest that a significant dose increase from the current clinically used dosing regimen is necessary to reach the EC50,unbound value for both populations. Based on safety data, higher doses would likely lead to QT prolongation and gastrointestinal disorders (nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea), thus, any dose adjustment must be carefully weighed alongside these safety concerns.","Thakur, Aarzoo; Tan, Shawn Pei Feng; Chan, James Chun Yip",Clin Pharmacol Ther,,625

OBJECTIVE: We sought to analyze the value of the immunodeficiency scoring index (ISI) in predicting lower respiratory tract disease (LRTD) progression and mortality in a prospective cohort of consecutive adult (>16 years) allo-HSCT recipients with EvRh infection from December 1 2013 to December 1 2019 at two Spanish transplant centers. RESULTS: We included 234 allo-HSCT recipients with 383 EvRh episodes. Out of 383 EvRh episodes, 98 (25%) had LRTD. Multivariate logistic regression analysis identified three independent factors associated with LRTD progression: Ig G < 400 mg/dL, community-acquired respiratory virus (CARV) co-infection and high-risk ISI. Inclusion of Ig G levels and CARV co-infection in the ISI improved its performance by significantly increasing the area under the receiver operator characteristic curve (AUROC) from 0.643 to 0.734 (P = .03). Likewise, the two conditions identified by multivariate analyses as associated with higher probability of mortality were high-risk ISI and EvRh infection within 6 months after transplant. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings confirm the value of high-risk ISI in predicting both probability of EvRh LRTD and 3-month overall mortality. We also demonstrate that the original ISI could be adapted to other CARV types by including additional variables to improve its performance.","Pérez, Ariadna; Montoro, Juan; Hernani, Rafael; Lorenzo, Ignacio; Hernández-Boluda, Juan Carlos; Giménez, Estela; Gómez, María Dolores; Balaguer-Roselló, Aitana; Gonzalez-Barberá, Eva; Guerreiro, Manuel; Aguilar, Cristóbal; Navarro, David; Solano, Carlos; Sanz, Jaime; Piñana, José Luis",Transpl Infect Dis,,625

DESIGN: Data of 39 208 Brazilian adults from a Behaviour Web Survey were used. Unhealthy nutrition habits were eating fruits or vegetables for <5 d/week and ultra-processed food (sugary foods, snacks, ready-to-eat frozen foods and embedded foods) for &#8805;5 d/week. For incidence indicators, we only considered participants without unhealthy behaviour before the quarantine. We created four categories of change in TV-viewing and computer/tablet use, considering a cut-off point of 4 h/d for each behaviour (1 - consistently low, 2 - become low during the quarantine, 3 - become high during the quarantine or 4 - consistently high). Analyses were adjusted for sex, age group, highest academic achievement, per capita income, working status during the quarantine, skin colour and adherence to the quarantine. SETTING: Brazil. PARTICIPANTS: Brazilian adults (nationally representative). RESULTS: Logistic regression models revealed that high TV-viewing and computer/tablet use incidence were associated with higher odds for elevated frequency of ultra-processed food consumption (TV-viewing: OR 1·70; 95 % CI 1·37, 2·12; computer/tablet: OR 1·73; 95 % CI 1·31, 2·27) and low consumption of fruit and vegetables (TV-viewing: OR 1·70; 95 % CI 1·29, 2·23; computer/tablet: OR 1·53; 95 % CI 1·08, 2·17) incidence. Consistent high computer/tablet use also presented higher odds for incidence of elevated frequency of ultra-processed food consumption. CONCLUSIONS: Participants with incidence of sedentary behaviours were also more likely to present incidence of unhealthy diet during the COVID-19 pandemic quarantine.","Werneck, André O; Silva, Danilo R; Malta, Deborah C; Gomes, Crizian Saar; Souza-Júnior, Paulo Rb; Azevedo, Luiz O; Barros, Marilisa Ba; Szwarcwald, Célia L",Public Health Nutr,,625

This tool can be applied to all other surgical specialties. DESIGN: Prospective case series of 166 patients. SETTING: Single-centre tertiary neurosurgical department. PARTICIPANTS: All patients awaiting an elective neurosurgical procedure were included in this study. All emergency or life-threatening neurosurgical pathologies affecting patients were excluded. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The risk assessment tool identified patients with progressive neurology and stratified need for surgery against risk of harm during the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS: Using our risk stratification tool, 6.6% patients required expedited surgery and a further 11.4% patients were removed completely from the waiting list. The majority of patients 47%, required surgery within 3 months. CONCLUSIONS: This simple tool encourages surgical departments to establish contact with patients during COVID-19. The clinician acquires up-to-date information regarding patient symptomatology and subsequently determines surgical priority, a timescale required for surgery and overall uses of NHS resources efficiently. We recommend the use of this tool for all neurosurgical departments, with a wider application to other surgical specialties during the ongoing pressures of elective backlogs secondary to the persistent COVID-19 pandemic.","Youshani, Amir Saam; Whittle, Chelsea; Ghosh, Kaushik",Br J Neurosurg,,625

A total of 170 adult patients were enrolled and all-cause mortality was found to be 39% (67/170). Most non-survivors were above 60 years of age (64%) while gender distribution was quite similar in both groups (males: 77% vs 78%). Most (80.6%) non-survivors came with peripheral oxygen saturation less than 93% while 95% of them had critical disease on arrival. Use of non-invasive ventilation in emergency room was higher among non-survivors (56.7%) versus survivors (26.2%). Median Interleukin-6 levels were higher among non-survivors (78.6: IQR = 33.8-49.0) compared to survivors (21.8: IQR = 12.6-36.3). Most patients in the non-survivor group (86.6%) required invasive ventilator support during hospital stay compared to 7.8% in the survivors. The median duration of ICU stay was longer for non-survivors (9: IQR = 6-12) compared to survivors (5: IQR = 3-7) days. Univariable binary logistic regression showed that age above 60 years, oxygen saturation below 93%, Neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio above 5, procalcitonin above 2ng/ml, unit increase in SOFA score and arterial lactate levels were associated with mortality. We also found that a unit decrease in Pao2/FiO2 ratio and serum albumin were associated with mortality in our patients. Multivariable regression showed that age above 60 years (aOR = 3.4: 95% CI = 1.6-6.9), peripheral oxygen saturation below 93% (aOR = 3.5:95% CI = 1.6-7.7) and serum pro-calcitonin above 2ng/ml (aOR = 4.8; 95% CI = 1.9-12.2) were associated with higher odds of mortality when adjusted by month of admission. Most common cause of death was multisystem organ failure in 35 (56.6%) non-survivors while 22 (35.5%) died due to respiratory failure. Larger prospective studies are needed to further strengthen these findings.","Sarfaraz, Samreen; Shaikh, Quratulain; Saleem, Syed Ghazanfar; Rahim, Anum; Herekar, Fivzia Farooq; Junejo, Samina; Hussain, Aneela",PLoS One,,625

The laboratory diagnostic methods for human coronavirus infections have evolved substantially, with the development of novel assays as well as the availability of updated tests for emerging ones. Newer laboratory methods are fast, highly sensitive and specific, and are gradually replacing the conventional gold standards. This presentation reviews the current laboratory methods available for testing coronaviruses by focusing on the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak going on in Wuhan. Viral pneumonias typically do not result in the production of purulent sputum. Thus, a nasopharyngeal swab is usually the collection method used to obtain a specimen for testing. Nasopharyngeal specimens may miss some infections; a deeper specimen may need to be obtained by bronchoscopy. Alternatively, repeated testing can be used because over time, the likelihood of the SARS-CoV-2 being present in the nasopharynx increases. Several integrated, random-access, point-of-care molecular devices are currently under development for fast and accurate diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infections.

352023,The Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Primary Emotional Systems and Emotional Regulation,2021,"INTRODUCTION: The WHO declared 2019 severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) a public health emergency of international concern. The National and Regional Health System has been reorganized, and many oncological patients died during this period or had to interrupt their therapies. This study summarizes a single-centre experience, during the COVID-19 period in Italy, in the treatment of brain metastases with Gamma Knife stereotactic radiosurgery (GKRS). METHODS: We retrospectively analysed our series of patients with brain metastases who underwent GKRS at the Niguarda Hospital from February 24 to April 24, 2020. RESULTS: We treated 30 patients with 66 brain metastases. A total of 22 patients came from home and 8 patients were admitted to the emergency room for urgent neurological symptoms. Duration of stay was limited to 0-1 day in 17 patients. We chose to treat a cluster of 9 patients, whose greater lesion exceeded 10 cm3, with 2-stage modality GKRS to minimize tumour recurrence and radiation necrosis. CONCLUSION: Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the whole world is at a critical crossroads about the use of health care resources. During the COVID-19 outbreak, the deferral of diagnostic and therapeutic procedures and a work backlog in every medical specialty are the natural consequences of reservation of resources for COVID-19 patients. GKRS improved symptoms and reduced the need for open surgeries, allowing many patients to continue their therapeutic path and sparing beds in ICUs. Neurosurgeons have to take into account the availability of stereotactic radiosurgery to reduce hospital stay, conciliating safety for patients and operators with the request for health care coming from the oncological patients and their families.","Crisà, Francesco Maria; Leocata, Filippo; Arienti, Virginia Maria; Picano, Marco; Berta, Luca; Mainardi, Hae Song; Monti, Angelo Filippo; Musca, Francesco; Colombo, Silvia; Palazzi, Mauro; La Camera, Alessandro",Stereotact Funct Neurosurg,,625
356524,Association between maternal cadmium exposure and preterm birth: a meta-analysis,2020,"A machine learning assisted efficient, yet comprehensive characterization of the dynamics of coronaviruses, in conjunction with finite element (FE) approach, is presented. Without affecting the accuracy of prediction in low-frequency vibration analysis, an equivalent model for the FE analysis is proposed, based on which the natural frequencies corresponding to first three non-rigid modes are analyzed. To quantify the inherent system-uncertainty efficiently, Monte Carlo simulation is proposed in conjunction with the machine learning based FE computational framework for obtaining complete probabilistic descriptions considering both individual and compound effect of stochasticity. A variance based sensitivity analysis is carried out to enumerate the relative significance of different material parameters corresponding to various constituting parts of the coronavirus structure. Using the modal characteristics like natural frequencies and mode shapes of the virus structure including their stochastic bounds, it is possible to readily identify coronaviruses by comparing the experimentally measured dynamic responses in terms of the peaks of frequency response function. Results from this first of its kind study on coronaviruses along with the proposed generic machine learning based approach will accelerate the detection of viruses and create efficient pathways toward future inventions leading to cure and containment in the field of virology.","Mukhopadhyay, T.; Naskar, S.; Gupta, K.

The main transmission routes of SARS-CoV-2 comprise human-to-human droplet infection, including inhalation and contact infection of patient's saliva, blood and other body fluids through oral mucosa, nasal mucosa, and the eyes, and orofecal transmission. Dental treatment necessitates close-proximity, face-to-face practices and can generate droplets or aerosols containing water, saliva, blood, microorganisms, and other debris during the procedure. Therefore, dental professionals are at a high risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection. To prevent nosocomial SARS-CoV-2 spread during dental procedures, Taipei City Hospital established a dental patient triage and workflow algorithm for the provision of dental services during the COVID-19 pandemic. Given the highly contagious nature of SARS-CoV-2, it is imperative to institute an appropriate standard procedural policy for patient management and recommendation of dental treatment at hospitals during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Lee, Ya-Ling; Chu, Dachen; Chou, Sin-Yi; Hu, Hsiao-Yun; Huang, Sheng-Jean; Yen, Yung-Feng",,,625

This may improve outcomes in patients hospitalised for COVID-19. METHODS: Placebo-controlled double-blind randomised multicentre trial. Patients &#8805;18â years, admitted to hospital for&#8804;48â h (not intensive care) with a positive SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR test, were recruited. The intervention was 500â mg daily azithromycin for 3â days followed by 250â mg daily azithromycin for 12â days combined with 200â mg twice daily hydroxychloroquine for all 15â days. The control group received placebo/placebo. The primary outcome was days alive and discharged from hospital within 14â days (DAOH14). RESULTS: After randomisation of 117 patients, at the first planned interim analysis, the data and safety monitoring board recommended stopping enrolment due to futility, based on pre-specified criteria. Consequently, the trial was terminated on February 1, 2021. A total of 61 patients received the combined intervention and 56 patients received placebo. In the intervention group, patients had a median of 9.0 DAOH14 (IQR, 3-11) versus. 9.0 DAOH14 (IQR, 7-10) in the placebo group (p=0.90). The primary safety outcome, death from all causes on day 30, occurred for 1 patient in the intervention group versus. 2 patients receiving placebo (p=0.52), and readmittance or death within 30â days occurred for 9 patients in the intervention group versus. 6 patients receiving placebo (p=0.57).

373462,Sensory Processing Sensitivity and Compassion Satisfaction as Risk/Protective Factors from Burnout and Compassion Fatigue in Healthcare and Education Professionals,2021,"The global pandemic outbreak COVID-19 (SARS-COV-2), has prompted many pharmaceutical companies to develop vaccines and therapeutic biologics for its prevention and treatment. Most of the therapeutic biologics are common human IgG antibodies, which were identified by next-generation sequencing (NGS) with the B cells from the convalescent patients. To fight against pandemic outbreaks like COVID-19, biologics development strategies need to be optimized to speed up the timeline. Since the advent of therapeutic biologics, strategies of transfection and cell line selection have been continuously improved for greater productivity and efficiency. NGS has also been implemented for accelerated cell bank testing. These recent advances enable us to rethink and reshape the chemistry, manufacturing, and controls (CMC) strategy in order to start supplying Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) materials for clinical trials as soon as possible. We elucidated an accelerated CMC workflow for biologics, including using GMP-compliant pool materials for phase I clinical trials, selecting the final clone with product quality similar to that of phase I materials for late-stage development and commercial production.","Zhang, Zheng; Chen, Ji; Wang, Junghao; Gao, Qiao; Ma, Zhujun; Xu, Shurong; Zhang, Li; Cai, Jill; Zhou, Weichang",Biotechnol Prog,,625
373546,The Utilization of Protective Face Masks among Polish Healthcare Workers during COVID-19 Pandemic: Do We Pass the Exam?,2021,"OBJECTIVES: In an effort to mitigate COVID-19 related challenges for clinical research, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued new guidance for the conduct of 'virtual' clinical trials in late March 2020. This study documents trends in the use of connected digital products (CDPs), tools that enable remote patient monitoring and telehealth consultation, in clinical trials both before and after the onset of the pandemic. DESIGN: We applied a comprehensive text search algorithm to clinical trial registry data to identify trials that use CDPs for remote monitoring or telehealth. We compared CDP use in the months before and after the issuance of FDA guidance facilitating virtual clinical trials. SETTING: All trials registered on ClinicalTrials.gov with start dates from May 2019 through February 2021. OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome measure was the overall percentage of CDP use in clinical trials started in the 10 months prior to the pandemic onset (May 2019-February 2020) compared with the 10 months following (May 2020-February 2021). Secondary outcome measures included CDP usage by trial type (interventional, observational), funder type (industry, non-industry) and diagnoses (COVID-19 or non-COVID-19 participants). RESULTS: CDP usage in clinical trials increased by only 1.65 percentage points, from 14.19% (n=23 473) of all trials initiated in the 10 months prior to the pandemic onset to 15.84% (n=26 009) of those started in the 10 months following (p<0.01). The increase occurred primarily in observational studies and non-industry funded trials and was driven entirely by CDP usage in trials for COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that in the short-term, new options created by regulatory guidance to stimulate telehealth and remote monitoring were not widely incorporated into clinical research. In the months immediately following the pandemic onset, CDP adoption increased primarily in observational and non-industry funded studies where virtual protocols are likely medically necessary due to the participants' COVID-19 diagnosis.","Marra, Caroline; Gordon, William J; Stern, Ariel Dora",BMJ Open,,625

We hypothesized differences in routine biochemistry and haematology indices in Caucasian and a combined group of Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic (BAME) patients who tested positive for COVID-19 who died, compared to survivors. METHODS: We tested our hypothesis in 445 patients (229 Caucasian, 216 BAME) admitted to secondary care with proven COVID-19 infection, in whom standard routine laboratory indices were collected on admission. RESULTS: After 28 weeks, 190 (42.7%) had died within 28 days of COVID diagnosis (97 Caucasians [42.4%], 93 BAMEs [43.1%], P = .923). A general linear model analysis found the ethnicity interaction with mortality to be significant for fibrinogen, ferritin and HbA1 c (after controlling for age). In a multivariate analysis, a neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio > 7.4 and a urea/albumin ratio > 0.28 increased the odds of death for both the Caucasian and the BAME group. Additional factors increasing the odds ratio in the BAME group included age >60 years and being diabetic. CONCLUSION: Neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio and urea/albumin ratio are simple metrics that predict death to aid clinicians in determining the prognosis of COVID-19 and help provide early intensive intervention to reduce mortality. In the BAME groups, intensive monitoring even at younger age and those with diabetes may also help reduce COVID-19 associated mortality.","Marwah, Mandeep; Marwah, Sukhjinder; Blann, Andrew; Morrissey, Hana; Ball, Patrick; Wandroo, Farooq A",Int. j. lab. hematol,,625
377827,Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Patients Affected by Non-Communicable Diseases in Europe and in the USA,2021,"Background: Chai-Ling decoction (CLD), derived from a modification of Xiao-Chai-Hu (XCH) decoction and Wu-Ling-San (WLS) decoction, has been used to treat the early-stage of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). However, the mechanisms of CLD in COVID-19 remain unknown. In this study, the potential mechanisms of CLD in COVID-19 were preliminarily investigated based on network pharmacology and molecular docking method. Methods: Initially, the active components and targets of CLD were screened based on Traditional Chinese Medicine Systems Pharmacology Database and Analysis Platform and PharmMapper database. The targets of COVID-19 were obtained from GeneCards database. The protein-protein interaction network was established using STRING database to analyze the key targets. Gene Oncology (GO) analysis and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes analysis were also conducted to evaluate the pathways related to the targets of CLD on COVID-19. Moreover, the compound-target-pathway network was established using Cytoscape 3.2.7. Subsequently, the molecular docking method was performed to select the active compounds with high binding affinity on severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is the key target of SARS-CoV-2 in entering target cells. The possible binding sites were also visualized by a three-dimensional graph. Results: Network pharmacology analysis showed that there were 106 active components and 160 targets of CLD. Additionally, 251 targets related to COVID-19 were identified, and 24 candidates of CLD on COVID-19 were selected. A total of 283 GO terms of CLD on COVID-19 were identified, and 181 pathways were screened based on GO and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes analyses. CLD might alleviate the inflammatory response and improve lung injury to treat COVID-19 through interleukin 17 signaling, T helper cell 17 differentiation, tumor necrosis factor signaling, and hypoxia inducible factor-1 signaling. Besides, molecular docking indicated that beta-sitosterol, kaempferol, and stigmasterol were the top three candidates in CLD with the highest affinity to SARS-CoV-2 and ACE2. Conclusion: Our study identifies the potential mechanisms of CLD on COVID-19 and beta-sitosterol, kaempferol, and stigmasterol may be the key compounds that exert antiviral effects against SARS-CoV-2.","Yang, Lu; Li, Yu-Ting; Miao, Jing; Wang, Li; Fu, Hui; Li, Qin; Wen, Wei-Bo; Zhang, Zhai-Yi; Song, Rui-Wen; Liu, Xiang-Guo; Wang, Hong-Wu; Cui, Huan-Tian",Traditional Med.Res.,,625

States have policy flexibility to design programs within federal parameters. However, Medicaid also requires funding flexibility to encourage states to maintain services during times of crisis when more people need Medicaid. Currently, Medicaid's funding formula, the Federal Medical Assistance Percentage (FMAP), adjusts federal spending by state levels of economic development but fails to adjust for nationwide recessions. During economic contractions, the federal government should use its ability to run budget deficits to reimburse states at higher rates in exchange for maintaining services. In turn, during economic expansions, states should shoulder relatively more costs of Medicaid. Although the current FMAP boost provided under the Families First Coronavirus Response Act has reduced strain on state Medicaid programs, it does not account for the severity of state-specific downturns and is limited to the current emergency. Instead of ad hoc, across-the-board FMAP boosts to respond to each crisis, Congress should pass legislation making automatic adjustments based on changes in state unemployment rates.","O039,; Mahen, Patrick N; Petersen, Laura A",J. gen. intern. med,,625

Internet-based psychological measurement can play an important role in collecting imperative data, assisting to guide evidence-based decision making in practice and policy, and subsequently facilitating immediate reporting of measurement results to participants. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to use an internet-based mental health measurement platform to compare the mental health profile of community members during COVID-19 with community members assessed before the pandemic. METHODS: This study uses an internet-based self-assessment tool to collect data on psychological distress, mental well-being, and resilience in community cohorts during (n=673) and prior to the pandemic (two cohorts, n=1264 and n=340). RESULTS: Our findings demonstrate significantly worse outcomes on all mental health measures for participants measured during COVID-19 compared to those measured before (P<.001 for all outcomes, effect sizes ranging between Cohen d=0.32 to Cohen d=0.81. Participants who demonstrated problematic scores for at least one of the mental health outcomes increased from 58% (n=197/340) before COVID-19 to 79% (n=532/673) during COVID-19, leading to only 21% (n=141) of measured participants displaying good mental health during the pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: The results clearly demonstrate deterioration in mental health outcomes during COVID-19. Although further research is needed, our findings support the serious mental health implications of the pandemic and highlight the utility of internet-based data collection tools in providing evidence to innovate and strengthen practice and policy during and after the pandemic.","van Agteren, Joep; Bartholomaeus, Jonathan; Fassnacht, Daniel B; Iasiello, Matthew; Ali, Kathina; Lo, Laura; Kyrios, Michael",JMIR Ment Health,,625

Although some developed countries have a very high testing rate and subsequently a high number of confirmed cases, less developed countries have a low testing rate and an illusive positivity rate. Collection of the upper respiratory specimen is not often comfortable. The discomfort could be accompanied with epistaxis and headache in some patients. The trained personnel taking the swab is forced to protect self with personal protective equipment (PPE) to avoid infections that may result from the patient due to provoked cough, sneezing and spitting. This study looks into an efficient means of increasing the testing rate for COVID 19 without compromising the quality. A literature review was conducted on the different modalities of collecting upper respiratory specimens and assessing the efficacy of samples collected using different methods in terms of the laboratory yield of different pathogens. Self-collection of upper respiratory tract specimen for diagnostic purposes is not new. Studies have demonstrated that trained staff-collected nasal swabs are not in any way superior to self-collected or parent-assisted swabs.

However, little information is available about the AKI in COVID-19. We aimed to evaluate the incidence, risk factors, and prognosis of AKI in adult patients with COVID-19. DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, & MEASUREMENTS: This was a retrospective cohort study of 1392 patients with COVID-19 admitted to a tertiary teaching hospital. Clinical characteristics and laboratory data were extracted from electronic hospitalization and laboratory databases. AKI was defined and staged according to the 2012 Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes criteria. Risk factors for AKI and the association of AKI with in-hospital mortality were assessed. RESULTS: A total of 7% (99 of 1392) of patients developed AKI during hospitalization, 40% (40 of 99) of which occurred within 1 week of admission. Factors associated with a higher risk of AKI include severe disease (odds ratio [OR], 2.25; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.37 to 3.67), higher baseline serum creatinine (OR, 2.19; 95% CI, 1.17 to 4.11), lymphopenia (OR, 1.99; 95% CI, 1.12 to 3.53), and elevated D-dimer level (OR, 2.68; 95% CI, 1.07 to 6.70). The in-hospital mortality in patients with AKI stage 1, stage 2, and stage 3 was 62%, 77%, and 80%, respectively. AKI was associated with in-hospital mortality even after adjustment for confounders (OR, 5.12; 95% CI, 2.70 to 9.72). CONCLUSIONS: AKI is uncommon but carries high in-hospital mortality in patients with COVID-19.","Cheng, Yichun; Luo, Ran; Wang, Xu; Wang, Kun; Zhang, Nanhui; Zhang, Meng; Wang, Zhixiang; Dong, Lei; Li, Junhua; Zeng, Rui; Yao, Ying; Ge, Shuwang; Xu, Gang",Clin J Am Soc Nephrol,,625

403701,Sleep and Mental Health Disturbances Due to Social Isolation during the COVID-19 Pandemic in Mexico,2021,"Background: There are scanty data on the occurrence of gastric tumours overexpressing human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) in Africa. Objective: To assess HER2 protein overexpression in gastric and gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma (GGEAC) samples from a single centre in Zambia. Methodology: This was a cross-sectional study of formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded blocks with GGEAC. Prepared slides were first stained with Haematoxylin and Eosin and then evaluated for HER2 protein overexpression by immunohistochemistry. Results: A total of 57 gastric tissues were stained and evaluated for HER2 overexpression. Thirteen (23%) showed overexpression, 41/57 (72%) had negative and 3/57 (5%) had equivocal staining. The equivocal cases were excluded from the final analysis. Of the remaining 54 tissues, 28 (52%) were from females, and 26 (48%) were from males. The mean age was 59 years (SD 15 years). HER2 overexpression was highest in moderately differentiated tumours (p=0.0005). Intestinal type tumours had a higher occurrenc of HER2 overexpression than diffuse or mixed sub-types (p=0.0087). HER2 overexpression was not associated with age (p=0.27), sex (p=1.00) or anatomical location (p=1.00). Conclusion: The occurrence of GGEAC HER2 overexpression in Zambian patients is similar to proportions reported elsewhere, and it is associated with moderately differentiated tumours of the intestinal type.","Kasochi, Chimwasu; Julius, Peter; Mweemba, Isaac; Kayamba, Violet",Afr Health Sci,,625

[...]focusing on gender gaps in salary alone leads to a substantial underestimation of the long-term effects of the gender gap. Despite having a multi-pronged retirement income system that provides various sources of income triggered at retirement (normally age 65), many of these pension programs provide less access to or lower benefits for women. Public pensions have not kept pace with the rising cost of living, largely due to the indexation of public pension plans being tied to prices, not wages (Baldwin & Shillington, 2017), and the depreciating values of these plans have a more dramatic impact on women.

413803,A 2-Month Follow-Up Study of Psychological Distress among Italian People during the COVID-19 Lockdown,2020,"OBJECTIVES: The COVID-19 pandemic reduced access to gambling and contributed to widespread psychological distress. Psychological distress is a known risk factor for problem gambling as it can motivate excessive gambling as a coping response. The availability of gambling is considered a factor in maintaining problems. This paper aimed to investigate the impact of the shutdown of gambling venues on Australians, particularly among those vulnerable to mental health problems and gambling disorder. METHODS: Australian adults who had gambled at least once in the past 12 months (Nâ=â764, 85.2% male) completed an online cross-sectional survey. Self-report measures retrospectively assessed typical monthly gambling frequency and expenditure before and after the COVID-19 venue shutdown, problem gambling, and psychological distress. RESULTS: Significant median decreases in gambling frequency were observed, both online and overall. No relationship was found between psychological distress and baseline or increases in gambling. Greater problem gambling severity was related to higher baseline gambling, but not to increases in gambling. Exploratory analysis showed that individuals engaged in moderate-risk gambling, but not problem gambling, were more likely to report increased gambling frequency compared to nonproblem and low-risk gamblers combined. CONCLUSIONS: Findings provide important insights into how changes in availability influence gambling participation, and for understanding the effectiveness of forced restrictions and venue exclusion strategies. Most people moderated their gambling when venue-based gambling was unavailable and opportunities for sports betting were limited. However, harms experienced by individuals with some gambling problems may have been exacerbated during the period of limited access. Policies to enhance prevention and treatment of gambling problems are necessary even when availability is reduced.","Gainsbury, Sally M; Swanton, Thomas B; Burgess, Martin T; Blaszczynski, Alex",Journal of addiction medicine (Online),,625
415808,"Perceived Health Problems of Young Single-Person Households in Housing Poverty Living in Seoul, South Korea: A Qualitative Study",2021,"In this paper we discuss ethical implications of the use of mobile phone apps in the control of the COVID-19 pandemic. Contact tracing is a well-established feature of public health practice during infectious disease outbreaks and epidemics. However, the high proportion of pre-symptomatic transmission in COVID-19 means that standard contact tracing methods are too slow to stop the progression of infection through the population. To address this problem, many countries around the world have deployed or are developing mobile phone apps capable of supporting instantaneous contact tracing. Informed by the on-going mapping of 'proximity events' these apps are intended both to inform public health policy and to provide alerts to individuals who have been in contact with a person with the infection. The proposed use of mobile phone data for 'intelligent physical distancing' in such contexts raises a number of important ethical questions. In our paper, we outline some ethical considerations that need to be addressed in any deployment of this kind of approach as part of a multidimensional public health response. We also, briefly, explore the implications for its use in future infectious disease outbreaks.","Parker, Michael J; Fraser, Christophe; Abeler-Dörner, Lucie; Bonsall, David",J. med. ethics,,625

421788,Tele-Rehabilitation for People with Dementia during the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Case-Study from England,2021,"The importance of a well-functioning and balanced immune system has become more apparent in recent decades. Various elements have however not yet been uncovered as shown, for example, in the uncertainty on immune system responses to COVID-19. Fungal beta-glucans are bioactive molecules with immunomodulating properties. Insights into the effects and function of beta-glucans, which have been used in traditional Chinese medicine for centuries, advances with the help of modern immunological and biotechnological methods. However, it is still unclear into which area beta-glucans fit best: supplements or medicine? This review has highlighted the potential application of fungal beta-glucans in nutrition and medicine, reviewing their formulation, efficacy, safety profile, and immunomodulating effects. The current status of dietary fungal glucans with respect to the European scientific requirements for health claims related to the immune system and defense against pathogens has been reviewed. Comparing the evidence base of the putative health effects of fungal beta-glucan supplements with the published guidance documents by EFSA on substantiating immune stimulation and pathogen defense by food products shows that fungal beta-glucans could play a role in supporting and maintaining health and, thus, can be seen as a good health-promoting substance from food, which could mean that this effect may also be claimed if approved. In addition to these developments related to food uses of beta-glucan-containing supplements, beta-glucans could also hold a novel position in Western medicine as the concept of trained immunity is relatively new and has not been investigated to a large extent. These innovative concepts, together with the emerging success of modern immunological and biotechnological methods, suggest that fungal glucans may play a promising role in both perspectives, and that there are possibilities for traditional medicine to provide an immunological application in both medicine and nutrition.","van Steenwijk, Hidde P; Bast, Aalt; de Boer, Alie",Nutrients,,625

Astrophysical models suggest finite possibility of binary systems with appreciable non-zero eccentricity in the dense stellar environment like globular clusters and galactic nuclei. While most of the compact binary measurements have not shown appreciable eccentricity, constrains on the eccentricity have been placed on few detected events. With increasing sensitivity of the gravitational wave detectors, the eccentric binaries are plausible sources in the gravitational wave window. Nevertheless, the challenges in the waveform modelling for high values of eccentricity constrain both the search methodologies of eccentric system as well as parameter estimation of the eccentricity. Waveform independent approaches are being investigated. In this work, we demonstrate that a new effective chirp mass $\mathcal{M}_e$ parameter can be defined which governs the dynamics of the non-spinning eccentric compact binary system. We obtain the phenomenological model of the same for low to moderate eccentricity values. One direct implication is its application in the unmodelled searches and as an another implication, we demonstrate that this model can be used to constrain the eccentricity of the non-spinning eccentric binaries in the advanced detector era in the waveform model-independent way.","Bose, Nirban; Pai, Archana",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2107.14736v1.pdf,625

However, the susceptibility of the decidua to infection during the peripartum period has not been explored, even though this may affect vertical transmission. The objective of this study was to investigate the expression of ACE2 and related genes in the decidua during delivery. Here, single-cell RNA sequencing was used to characterize the transcriptomes of decidual cells before and after the onset of labor. During the peripartum period, ACE2 expression was highly heterogeneous. ACE2 was expressed principally in decidual stromal cells, uterine smooth muscle cells, and extravillous trophoblasts. Comparison of the transcriptomes of ACE2-positive and ACE2-negative cells indicated that ACE2-positive cells exhibited integrin clusters on the cell surface interactions. ACE2-positive cells were compared before and after labor onset. After delivery, the number of ACE2-positive cells was slightly higher than before delivery. Before labor onset, ACE2-positive decidual stromal cells were in the regulation of membrane protein ectodomain proteolysis cluster. After labor onset, the upregulated genes changed to include cell junction assembly genes. The susceptibility of decidual cells to SARS-CoV-2 infection is thus heterogeneous during the peripartum period. © 2021 E-Century Publishing Corporation.

METHODS: We conducted a systematic search on PubMed/LitCovid, Scopus, and Web of Sciences databases for papers in the English language only, up to 1 January 2021. We used the Joanna Briggs Institute checklist developed for cross-sectional studies to appraise the quality of the included studies. All stages of the review conducted by two independent reviewers and potential discrepancies were solved with a consultation with a third reviewer. We reported the result as number and percentage. A meta-analysis conducted using a random effect model with a 95% confidence interval. RESULTS: Forty-eight studies encompassing 76,848 participants were included in this review. 56.53% of the participants were female. The mean age of the participants was 33.7 years. 85.42% of the included studies were scored as good quality, 12.50% as fair quality, and the remaining (2.08%) as low quality. About 87.5% examined all three components of the KAPs model. The knowledge component was reported as good and poor in 89.5% and 10.5% of the included studies, respectively. Of the studies that examined the attitude component, 100% reported a positive attitude. For the practice component, 93.2% reported satisfactory practice, and 6.8% poor practice. The result of the meta-analysis showed that the overall score of KAPs components about COVID-19 were 78.9, 79.8, and 74.1, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: This systematic review and meta-analysis showed that the overall KAP components in the included studies were at an acceptable level. In general, knowledge was at a good level, the attitude was positive and practice was at a satisfactory level.

432437,Prenatal Fine Particulate Matter (PM2.5) Exposure and Pregnancy Outcomes-Analysis of Term Pregnancies in Poland,2020,"OBJECTIVE: With the epidemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), the healthcare workers (HCWs) require proper respiratory personal protective equipment (rPPE) against viral respiratory infectious diseases (VRIDs). It is necessary to evaluate which type of mask and manner of wearing is the best suitable rPPE for preventing the VRID. STUDY DESIGN: A Bayesian network meta-analysis was performed to comprehensively analyze the protective efficacy of various rPPE. METHODS: This network meta-analysis protocol was registered in an international prospective register of systematic reviews (CRD42020179489). Electronic databases were searched for cluster randomized control trials (RCTs) of comparing the effectiveness of rPPE and wearing manner in preventing HCWs from VRID. The primary outcome was the incidence of laboratory-confirmed viral respiratory infection reported as an odds ratio (OR) with the associated 95% credibility interval (CrI). The secondary outcome was the incidence of clinical respiratory illness (CRI) reported as an OR with the associated 95% CrI. Surface under the cumulative ranking curve analysis (SUCRA) provided a ranking of each rPPE according to the primary outcome and the secondary outcome as data supplement. RESULTS: Six studies encompassing 12,265 HCWs were included. In terms of the incidence of laboratory-confirmed viral respiratory infection, the continuous wearing of N95 respirators (network OR, 0.48; 95% CrI: 0.27 to 0.86; SUCRA score, 85.4) showed more effective than the control group. However, in terms of reducing the incidence of CRI, there was no rPPE showing superior protective effectiveness. CONCLUSIONS: There are significant differences in preventive efficacy among current rPPE. Our result suggests that continuous wearing of N95 respirators on the whole shift can serve as the best preventive rPPE for HCWs from the VRID.","Yin, X; Wang, X; Xu, S; He, C",Public Health,,625
432699,Antibiotic Resistance of Legionella pneumophila in Clinical and Water Isolates-A Systematic Review,2020,"Introduction. Timely availability of effective influenza vaccine will be critical to mitigate the next influenza pandemic. The mission of Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) is to develop medical countermeasures against pandemics, including influenza and other health security threats.Areas covered. Despite considerable gains in pandemic vaccine preparedness since 2009, old and new challenges threaten the pandemic influenza response capabilities of the U.S. Government: insufficient U.S.-based vaccine production, two-dose vaccination regimen, logistically complex adjuvanted formulation, and sustained surge manufacturing capacity despite no commercial market for pandemic vaccines. Although the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has re-exposed these gaps in preparedness and response, previous investments into flexible influenza vaccine technologies proved to be critical to accelerate COVID-19 vaccine development.Expert opinion. BARDA addresses these challenges by implementing a pandemic influenza vaccine strategy with two key goals: 1) accelerating vaccine development and production (faster) and 2) improving vaccine performance (better). This strategy involves an end-to-end approach, including increasing manufacturing and fill-finish capacity; improving release testing speed; and funding clinical trials to improve current vaccine utilization. As demonstrated by the COVID-19 response, continued investments into this pandemic influenza vaccine strategy will further enhance the ability to respond to future emerging pandemic pathogens.","Newland, Matthew; Durham, David; Asher, Jason; Treanor, John J; Seals, Jonathan; Donis, Ruben O; Johnson, Robert A",Expert Rev Vaccines,,625

442783,Secondary Traumatic Stress and Burnout in Healthcare Workers during COVID-19 Outbreak,2021,"In standard rounding, we want to map each value $X$ in a large continuous space (e.g., $R$) to a nearby point $P$ from a discrete subset (e.g., $Z$). This process seems to be inherently discontinuous in the sense that two consecutive noisy measurements $X_1$ and $X_2$ of the same value may be extremely close to each other and yet they can be rounded to different points $P_1\ne P_2$, which is undesirable in many applications. In this paper we show how to make the rounding process perfectly continuous in the sense that it maps any pair of sufficiently close measurements to the same point. We call such a process consistent rounding, and make it possible by allowing a small amount of information about the first measurement $X_1$ to be unidirectionally communicated to and used by the rounding process of $X_2$. The fault tolerance of a consistent rounding scheme is defined by the maximum distance between pairs of measurements which guarantees that they are always rounded to the same point, and our goal is to study the possible tradeoffs between the amount of information provided and the achievable fault tolerance for various types of spaces. When the measurements $X_i$ are arbitrary vectors in $R^d$, we show that communicating $\log_2(d+1)$ bits of information is both sufficient and necessary (in the worst case) in order to achieve consistent rounding for some positive fault tolerance, and when d=3 we obtain a tight upper and lower asymptotic bound of $(0.561+o(1))k^{1/3}$ on the achievable fault tolerance when we reveal $\log_2(k)$ bits of information about how $X_1$ was rounded. We analyze the problem by considering the possible colored tilings of the space with $k$ available colors, and obtain our upper and lower bounds with a variety of mathematical techniques including isoperimetric inequalities, the Brunn-Minkowski theorem, sphere packing bounds, and \v{C}ech cohomology.","Dunkelman, Orr; Geyzel, Zeev; Keller, Chaya; Keller, Nathan; Ronen, Eyal; Shamir, Adi; Tessler, Ran J.",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.03675v1.pdf,625
442784,Secondary Traumatic Stress and Burnout in Healthcare Workers during COVID-19 Outbreak,2021,"OBJECTIVES: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic. The majority of patients experience asymptomatic to mild self-limited disease, but some cases progress to respiratory and multi-organ failure. However, so far, no approved antiviral therapy has been available for treatment of COVID-19. Sofosbuvir/velpatasvir (SOF/VEL) is an approved anti-HCV drug that is capable of suppressing other families of positive-sense RNA viruses with conserved polymerase and may be effective against SARS-CoV-2. This study was conducted to evaluate the efficacy of the SOF/VEL combination in addition to the national standard of care versus the national standard of care alone (hydroxychloroquine and lopinavir/ritonavir as well as supportive care) in patients with moderate to severe COVID-19 infection. METHODS: This single-centre, randomized, open-labelled, prospective clinical trial was done in patients with moderate to severe COVID-19 admitted to Farabi Hospital in Kermanshah Province, Iran. Eligible patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to the SOF/VEL arm (SOF/VEL plus the national standard of care) or the control arm (the national standard of care alone). The main outcome of the study was the mortality on Day 28 after randomization. Secondary outcomes were time from the start of medication to clinical improvement, hospital length of stay, need for mechanical ventilation, duration of mechanical ventilation and conversion of RT-PCR results from positive to negative from the time of randomization to discharge. Adverse events were evaluated in all patients who started their assigned treatment. RESULTS: Between 11 April and 8 June 2020, 80 patients were recruited and randomly assigned into the SOF/VEL (nâ=â40) and control (nâ=â40) arms. The primary outcome was not significantly different between the two arms (Pâ=â1.00). Secondary outcomes, including time to clinical improvement, hospital length of stay, need for mechanical ventilation, duration of mechanical ventilation and RT-PCR conversion, were not significantly different between arms either (Pâ>â0.05). SOF/VEL treatment and the national standard of care were tolerated similarly. CONCLUSIONS: Although treatment with SOF/VEL was safe, adding SOF/VEL to the standard of care did not improve the clinical status or reduce mortality in patients with moderate to severe COVID-19. However, larger randomized clinical trials including more parameters are needed for accurate estimation of the efficacy of SOF/VEL.","Sayad, Babak; Khodarahmi, Reza; Najafi, Farid; Miladi, Ronak; Mohseni Afshar, Zeinab; Mansouri, Feizollah; Rahimi, Zohreh; Shirvani, Maria; Salimi, Mehdi; Vaziri, Siavash; Janbakhsh, Alireza; Khosravi Shadmani, Fatemeh; Bozorgomid, Arezoo; Zamanian, Mohammad Hossein; Afsharian, Mandana",J Antimicrob Chemother,,625
444071,Factors Associated with Mental Health Results among Workers with Income Losses Exposed to COVID-19 in China,2020,"BackgroundSince the outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic, the world began a frantic search for possible prophylactic options. While trials on hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) prophylaxis are ongoing, concrete evidence is lacking. The study aimed to determine the relative efficacy of various doses of oral HCQ in prophylaxis and mitigating the severity of COVID-19 in healthcare workers. MethodsThis was a prospective cohort with four arms (high, medium, low dose, and control) of HCQ prophylaxis, used by healthcare workers at a tertiary care center in India. Participants were grouped as per their opting for any one arm on a voluntary basis as per institute policy under the Government guidance. The outcomes studied were COVID-19 positivity by RT-PCR and its severity assessed by WHO COVID-19 severity scale. ResultsTotal 486 participants were enrolled, of which 29 (6%) opted for low dose, 2 (<1%) medium dose, and none for high dose HCQ while 455 (93.6%) were in the control arm. Of the 164 participants who underwent RT-PCR, 96 (58.2%) tested positive. Out of these 96 positive cases, the majority of them (79 of 96 [82.3%]) were ambulatory and were managed conservatively at home. Only 17.7% (17 of 96) participants, all of them from the control group, required hospitalization with the mild-moderate disease. None of the participants had severe disease, COVID-related complications, ICU stay, or death. The difference in the outcome assessed amongst the various arms was statistically insignificant (p value >0.05). ConclusionThis single-center study demonstrated that HCQ prophylaxis in healthcare workers does not cause a significant reduction in COVID-19 as well as mitigating its severity in those infected. At present, most of the trials have not shown any benefit. The debate continues to rage, should HCQ prophylaxis be given to healthcare workers for chemoprophylaxis?","group, - RE-HCP2 study; Panda, Prasan Kumar",,,625

451099,Health(care) in the Crisis: Reflections in Science and Society on Opioid Addiction,2021,"The study of disaster-specific leadership of female university students has been largely neglected, especially during on-campus emergency eviction and evacuation. Based on the COVID-19-triggered, on-campus evictions across Canada and the United States, this cross-national partnership examined the out-of-province/state and international female university students’ leadership during the entire eviction process. Through in-depth interviews, this study revealed the female university students’ leadership behaviors during three stages: (1) pre-eviction: their self-preparedness formed an emotional foundation to support others;(2) peri-eviction: their attitude and leadership behavior enabled them to facilitate (psychologically and physically) their peers’ eviction process;and (3) post-eviction: they continued to support their peers virtually and raised the general public’s awareness regarding the plight of vulnerable and marginalized populations. This article argues that the female university students’ leadership that emerged during the eviction process became complementary to and even augmented the universities’ official efforts and beyond. This leadership represents empirical evidence that contributes to the existing literature on gender and leadership by demonstrating female youth as empowered stakeholders rather than as merely passive victims. Future studies could develop detailed stratification of gender and age dimensions in order to portray a more comprehensive picture of the younger generation’s leadership in hazards and disaster research and practice.","Wu, Haorui Perez-Lugo Marla Garcia Cecilio Ortiz Crespo Frances Gonzalez Castillo Adriana",International Journal of Disaster Risk Science,,625

However, contradictory findings have been reported regarding the impact of glycaemic control on COVID-19 outcome. The aim of this meta-analysis was to explore the impact of hospital pre-admission or at-admission values of HbA1c on COVID-19 mortality or worsening in patients with diabetes. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We searched PubMed, Embase and Scopus up to 30th December 2020. Eligibility criteria for study selection were the following: (1)enrolling patients with any form of diabetes mellitus and hospitalized for COVID-19 and (2) reporting data regarding HbA1c values before infection or at hospital admission in relation to COVID-19 mortality or worsening. Descriptive statistics, HbA1c values, odds ratios (ORs) and hazard ratios were extracted from seven observational studies and generic inverse variance (random effects) of OR was used to estimate the effect of HbA1c on COVID-19 outcome. RESULTS: HbA1c was linearly associated with an increased COVID-19 mortality or worsening when considered as a continuous variable (OR 1.01 [1.01, 1.01]; p < 0.00001). Similarly, when analysing studies providing the number of events according to the degree of glycaemic control among various strata, a significantly increased risk was observed with poor glycaemic control (OR 1.15 [1.11, 1.19]; p < 0.00001), a result corroborated by sensitivity analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Notwithstanding the large heterogeneity in study design and patients' characteristics in the few available studies, data suggest that patients with diabetes and poor glycaemic control before infection might have an increased risk of COVID-19 related mortality.","Prattichizzo, Francesco; de Candia, Paola; Nicolucci, Antonio; Ceriello, Antonio",Diabetes Metab Res Rev,,625

Therapy for symptoms must remain flexible and individualized because the specific needs of the patient will change as disease progresses. Because strangulation is uncommon, malignant bowel obstruction is usually not a surgical emergency. There is usually time to proceed with deliberate and thoughtful decisions on how best to meet the needs and expectations of the individual patient and family. Providers must be well versed in both surgical and nonsurgical therapeutic options, the natural history of disease, and be active and compassionate providers to foster meaningful ongoing dialogue focused on excellent care even after cure is no longer possible. The palliative triangle not only allows patient, family, and surgeon to effectively utilize the full continuum of care that can be delivered, but also it supports end-of-life decisions when continuity in care matters most.

486638,Global Impact of COVID-19 on Weight and Weight-Related Behaviors in the Adult Population: A Scoping Review,2021,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Statins are first-line therapy for lowering low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol in familial hypercholesterolemia (FH), particularly in heterozygous patients. We review advances and new questions on the use of statins in FH. RECENT FINDINGS: Cumulative evidence from registry data and sub-analyses of clinical trials mandates the value of statin therapy for prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) in FH. Statins are safe in children and adolescents with FH, with longer term cardiovascular benefits. The potentially toxic effects of statins in pregnancy need to be considered, but no association has been reported in prospective cohort studies with birth defects. There is no rationale for discontinuation of statins in elderly FH unless indicated by adverse events. FH is undertreated, with > 80% of statin-treated FH patients failing to attain LDL cholesterol treatment targets. This may relate to adherence, tolerability, and genetic differences in statin responsiveness. Statin treatment from childhood may reduce the need for stringent cholesterol targets. Combination of statins with ezetimibe and PCSK9 inhibitors significantly improves the efficacy of treatment. Whether statin use could improve the clinical course of FH patients with COVID-19 and other respiratory infections remains an unsolved issue for future research. Statins are the mainstay for primary and secondary prevention of ASCVD in FH. Sustained long-term optimal statin treatment from an early age can effectively prevent ASCVD over decades of life. Despite their widespread use, statins merit further investigation in FH.","Pang, Jing; Chan, Dick C; Watts, Gerald F",Curr Atheroscler Rep,,625

Material and Method: Qualitative phenomenological study. The participating group was ten nurses from public hospitals in Spain who had dialyzed patients with COVID-19. Data collection was performed using semi-structured interviews through Skype ©program, until the units of meaning were saturated. The analysis was done using the Colaizzi’s seven-step method. Results: Four dimensions emerged from the speech analysis associated with different subcategories: ignorance about the disease, patient suffering, perceived support and professionals' ability to cope. Conclusions: Positive and negative emotions have coexisted in nurses. In the peak stage of the epidemic outbreak, the experiences of hemodialysis nurses were caused by ignorance, not knowing how to act appropriately, and fear of infection, aggravated by the lack of means of protection. The positive experiences were personal growth, the support of the team and the family. It is also worth noting the rational control of the situation, because in the dialysis units there is great experience in controlling the transmission of infectious diseases.","Andreu-Periz, Dolores; Ochando-García, Antonio; Limón-Cáceres, Enric",Enferm.

The uncontrolled release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including interleukin (IL)-1ß and IL-6, is associated with ARDS. This constituted the first study to report on the variability in physicochemical properties of ß-glucans extracts from the same edible mushroom Lentinus edodes on the reduction of these pro-inflammatory cytokines and oxidative stress. Specifically, the impact on the immunomodulatory and cytoprotective properties of our novel in 'house' (IH-Lentinan, IHL) and a commercial (Carbosynth-Lentinan, CL) Lentinan extract were investigated using in vitro models of lung injury and macrophage phagocytosis. CL comprised higher amounts of &#945;-glucans and correspondingly less ß-glucans. The two lentinan extracts demonstrated varying immunomodulatory activities. Both Lentinan extracts reduced cytokine-induced NF-&#954;B activation in human alveolar epithelial A549 cells, with the IHL extract proving more effective at lower doses. In contrast, in activated THP-1 derived macrophages, the CL extract more effectively attenuated pro-inflammatory cytokine production (TNF-&#945;, IL-8, IL-2, IL-6, IL-22) as well as TGF-ß and IL-10. The CL extract attenuated oxidative stress-induced early apoptosis, while the IHL extract attenuated late apoptosis. Our findings demonstrate significant physicochemical differences between Lentinan extracts, which produce differential in vitro immunomodulatory and pulmonary cytoprotective effects that may also have positive relevance to candidate COVID-19 therapeutics targeting cytokine storm.","Murphy, Emma J; Masterson, Claire; Rezoagli, Emanuele; O039,; Toole, Daniel; Major, Ian; Stack, Gary D; Lynch, Mark; Laffey, John G; Rowan, Neil J",Sci Total Environ,,625

519081,Effects of Covid-19 Lockdown on Mental Health and Sleep Disturbances in Italy,2020,"OBJECTIVE: We tested the hypothesis that administration of vaginal progesterone in women with arrested preterm labor would result in lower rates of preterm birth <37 weeks compared to placebo. STUDY DESIGN: We performed a randomized, placebo-controlled trial comparing vaginal progesterone to placebo in women with arrested preterm labor. Our trial included women with a singleton or twin gestation at 240/7-336/7 weeks' gestation who presented with preterm labor with cervical dilation &#8805;1 centimeter but remained undelivered. Participants were randomized to receive vaginal progesterone 200 mg daily or an identical placebo. The primary outcome was preterm birth <37 weeks. We performed an updated systematic review and meta-analysis of clinical trials, including our results. We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINHAL, Scopus, the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and ClinicalTrials.gov using the key terms to identify relevant trials. The risk of bias was appraised using the Cochrane risk-of-bias tool. Data were synthesized using random-effects models. Heterogeneity was assessed using Higgins I2. RESULTS: The randomized trial was prematurely terminated due to slow recruitment. There were 18 women randomized to receive vaginal progesterone who had complete follow-up data and 18 women in the placebo group. The risk of preterm birth <37 weeks was not significantly different in the groups (RR 1.10, 95% CI 0.63-1.19). Secondary outcomes were also similar. Thirteen trials with 1658 women (835 in the vaginal progesterone and 823 in the control groups) were included in the meta-analysis. Risk of preterm birth <37 weeks was similar in women who received progesterone and those in the control group (pooled RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.83-1.35). Latency was significantly longer among women with arrested preterm labor who received vaginal progesterone (weighted mean difference: 9.2 d, 95% CI 3.2-15.1), but further analysis showed that prolonged latency was only observed in the subgroup of studies that were not placebo-controlled. CONCLUSIONS: This randomized controlled trial and meta-analysis do not support the use of vaginal progesterone for the prevention of preterm birth in women who present in preterm labor.","Frey, Heather A; Stout, Molly J; Abdelwahab, Mahmoud; Tuuli, Methodius G; Woolfolk, Candice; Shamshirsaz, Alireza A; Macones, George A; Cahill, Alison G",J Matern Fetal Neonatal Med,,625
590195,"Video-Based Communication and Its Association with Loneliness, Mental Health and Quality of Life among Older People during the COVID-19 Outbreak",2021-06-10,"Immaturity of the neonatal immune system is causative for high morbidity in calves and colostrum intake is crucial for acquiring passive immunity. Pathogenesis is promoted by reactive oxygen species accumulating at birth if counter-regulation is inadequate. The flavonol quercetin exerts antioxidative and anti-inflammatory effects that may enhance neonatal health. The aim of this work was to study effects of quercetin feeding on metabolic, antioxidative and inflammatory parameters in neonatal calves to investigate whether quercetin could compensate for insufficient colostrum supply. Twenty-eight newborn calves were assigned to two dietary groups fed colostrum or milk-based formula on day 1 and 2 and milk replacer thereafter. From day 2 onwards, 7 calves per diet group were additionally fed quercetin aglycone (50 mg/(kg body weight × day)). Blood samples were taken repeatedly to measure plasma concentrations of flavonols, glucose, lactate, total protein, albumin, urea, non-esterified fatty acids, triglycerides, cholesterol, insulin, glucagon, cortisol, immunoglobulins, fibrinogen, haptoglobin and serum amyloid A. Trolox equivalent antioxidative capacity, ferric reducing ability of plasma, thiobarbituric acid reactive species and F2-isoprostanes were analyzed to evaluate plasma antioxidative status. Expression of tumor necrosis factor, interleukin-1α, interleukin-1β, serum amyloid A, haptoglobin, fibrinogen, C-reactive protein, catalase, glutathione peroxidase and superoxide dismutase mRNA were measured in liver tissue on day 8. Plasma flavonol concentrations were detectable only after quercetin-feeding without differences between colostrum and formula feeding. Plasma glucose, lactate, total protein, immunoglobulins, triglycerides, cholesterol, trolox equivalent antioxidative capacity and thiobarbituric acid reactive species were higher after colostrum feeding. Body temperature, fecal fluidity and plasma concentrations of cortisol and haptoglobin were higher in formula- than in colostrum-fed groups. Hepatic mRNA expression of tumor necrosis factor was higher after quercetin feeding and expression of C-reactive protein was higher after formula feeding. Data confirm that colostrum improves neonatal health and indicate that quercetin feeding cannot compensate for insufficient colostrum supply.","Gruse, Jeannine; Kanitz, Ellen; Weitzel, Joachim M.; Tuchscherer, Armin; Stefaniak, Tadeusz; Jawor, Paulina; Wolffram, Siegfried; Hammon, Harald M.",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26752173/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0146932,625

591197,"Empowering Health Workers to Protect their Own Health: A Study of Enabling Factors and Barriers to Implementing HealthWISE in Mozambique, South Africa, and Zimbabwe",2020-06-23,"BACKGROUND Scotland-a country of 5.5 million people-has a rugged geography with many outlying islands, creating access challenges for many citizens. The government has long sought to mitigate these through a range of measures including an ambitious technology-enabled care (TEC) program. A strategy to develop a nationwide video consultation service began in 2017. Our mixed-method evaluation was commissioned in mid-2019 and extended to cover the pandemic response in 2020. OBJECTIVE To draw lessons from a national evaluation of the introduction, spread and scale-up of Scotland's video consultation services both before and during the pandemic. METHODS Data sources comprised 223 interviews (with patients, staff, technology providers and policymakers), 60 hours of ethnographic observation (including in-person visits to remote settings), patient and staff satisfaction surveys (N=20,349), professional and public engagement questionnaires (N=5400), uptake statistics and local and national documents. Fieldwork during the pandemic was of necessity conducted remotely. Data were analyzed thematically and theorized using the PERCS (Planning and Evaluating Remote Consultation Services) framework which considers multiple influences interacting dynamically and unfolding over time. RESULTS By the time the pandemic hit, there had been considerable investment in material and technological infrastructure, staff training, and professional and public engagement. Scotland was thus uniquely well placed to expand its video consultation services at pace and scale. Within four months (March-June 2020), the number of video consultations increased from about 330 to 17,000 per week nationally. While not everything went smoothly, video was used for a much wider range of clinical problems, vastly extending the pre-pandemic focus on outpatient monitoring of chronic stable conditions. The technology was generally considered dependable and easy to use. In most cases (78%, 14,677/18,817), patients reported no technical problems during their post-consultation survey. Healthcare organizations' general innovativeness and digital maturity had a strong bearing on their ability to introduce, routinize, and expand video consultation services. CONCLUSIONS The national-level groundwork before the pandemic allowed many services to rapidly extend the use video consultation during the pandemic, supported by a strong strategic vision, a well-resourced quality improvement model, dependable technology and multiple opportunities for staff to try out the video option. Scotland provides an important national case study from which other countries may learn.

The world wide burden of the disease has been massive, and the governments are in dilemma to protect the health system of the country while safeguarding the economy. There is no vaccine or antivirus drug found against this virus while multiple research groups are actively working on a suitable candidate. The only available mode of minimizing the disease burden has been to control its transmission among the population. Since the occurrence of first COVID 19 local case on 11 March 2020, the government of Sri Lanka introduced serious social distancing and public health interventions in its fullest capacity as a developing nation to effectively combat with the disease spread. This study focuses to develop a mathematical model to investigate the dynamic of this novel disease using an extended version of an SEIR compartmental structure considering the heterogeneity of cases such as asymptomatic, symptomatic with mild indications and the cases required intensive care treatments. All the measures and interventions are in progress with a significantly large social and economic cost, thus, optimal control techniques are used to identify the most appropriate strategies to minimize this cost. The results of the simulations prove that optimal control measures can be worked out as the epidemic curves are flattened while delaying the outbreak so that the health system might not be under pressure to treat and care the patients.","Wickramaarachchi, T.; Perera, S.",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.06.04.20122382; http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.06.04.20122382v1?rss=1,625

METHODS: This is a two-wave prospective study among Dutch adolescents using data collected up to one year before the COVID-19 pandemic (n = 224) and 5–8 weeks after the first introduction of lockdown measures (n = 158). Mental well-being was assessed by three indicators: life satisfaction, internalizing symptoms, and psychosomatic health. General linear model repeated-measures analysis of variance was used to assess whether mental well-being has changed and if this differed by sex. Univariate linear regressions were used to assess associations between COVID-19–related concerns and a change in mental well-being. RESULTS: Life satisfaction decreased (η(2)(p) = .079, p < .001), but no change in internalizing symptoms was observed (η(2)(p) = .014, p = .14), and psychosomatic health increased (η(2)(p) = .194, p < .001) after the introduction of lockdown measures. Boys scored significantly better on all mental health indicators compared with girls at baseline and follow-up. However, boys' life satisfaction significantly decreased at the follow-up (η(2)(p) = .038, p = .015), whereas girls' life satisfaction did not change. Concerns about COVID-19 were significantly associated with a lower life satisfaction and more internalizing symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Adolescents', especially boys', life satisfaction decreased during the lockdown. They reported no change in internalizing symptoms and an improved psychosomatic health. Adolescents' mental well-being is expected to vary during the COVID-19 pandemic and should continue to be monitored.","van der Laan, Sabine E.I.; Finkenauer, Catrin; Lenters, Virissa C.; van Harmelen, Anne-Laura; van der Ent, Cornelis K.; Nijhof, Sanne L.",J Adolesc Health,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1054139X21003566; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jadohealth.2021.07.013; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34446346/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1054139X21003566,625
592610,COVID-19 Preventive Behaviours in Cameroon: A Six-Month Online National Survey,2021-03-04,"Good-quality evidence on hand hygiene compliance among birth attendants in low-resource labor wards is limited. The World Health Organization Hand Hygiene Observation Form is widely used for directly observing behaviors, but it does not support capturing complex patterns of behavior. We developed the HANDS at Birth tool for direct observational studies of complex patterns of hand rubbing/washing, glove use, recontamination, and their determinants among birth attendants. Understanding these behaviors is particularly critical in wards with variable patient volumes or unpredictable patient complications, such as emergency departments, operating wards, or triage and isolation wards during epidemics. Here we provide detailed information on the design and implementation of the HANDS at Birth tool, with a particular focus on low-resource settings. We developed the HANDS at Birth tool from available guidelines, unstructured observation, and iterative refinement based on consultation with collaborators and pilot results. We designed the tool with WOMBAT software, which supports collecting multidimensional time-and-motion data. Our analysis of the tool’s performance centered on interobserver agreement and convergent validity and the implications of the data structure for data analysis. The HANDS at Birth tool encompasses various hand actions and context-relevant information. Hand actions include procedures relevant during labor and delivery; hand hygiene or glove actions; and other types of touch. During field implementation, we used the tool for continuous observation of the birth attendant. Interobserver agreement was good (kappa range: 0.7–0.9), and the tool showed convergent validity. Using the HANDS at Birth tool is a feasible way to obtain useful information about compliance with hand hygiene procedures. The tool could be used after simple training and allows for collection of reliable information about the complex pattern of hygiene behaviors. Future studies should explore using this tool to observe behavior in labor wards in other settings and in other types of wards.","Gon, Giorgia; Ali, Said M.; Aunger, Robert; Campbell, Oona M.; de Barra, Mícheál; de Bruin, Marijn; Juma, Mohammed; Nash, Stephen; Tajo, Amour; Westbrook, Johanna; Woodd, Susannah; Graham, Wendy J.",Glob Health Sci Pract,https://doi.org/10.9745/ghsp-d-20-00221; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33361245/,625
592736,Social Capital and Mental Health among Older Adults Living in Urban China in the Context of COVID-19 Pandemic,2020-10-29,"INTRODUCTION: Psychotropic medications that are primarily licenced for the treatment of psychiatric disorders are used widely (32%–85%) among people with intellectual disabilities (ID) often for the management of problem (challenging) behaviour in the absence of a psychiatric disorder. Care staff play a pivotal role in the prescribing process. Currently, no staff training programme exists to address the issue of overprescribing of psychotropic medication in people with ID, thus highlighting an urgent need for developing a psychoeducational programme (PEP) specifically designed to address this issue. We propose to develop a PEP for care staff using the methodology described in the UK Medical Research Council guide for complex interventions. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The development of the PEP will involve (1) gathering information on available relevant training programmes, (2) running four focus groups with care staff and other professionals to establish the content and format of the PEP, and (3) organising a co-design event involving all relevant stakeholders to discuss the format of the PEP. A core project team will develop the PEP under guidance from the PEP Development Group which will consist of 10–12 relevant stakeholder representatives. Feedback from selected stakeholders on a draft PEP will allow us to refine the PEP before implementation. The PEP will have web-based modules supplemented by face to face training sessions. When the final draft is ready, we will field test the PEP on six to eight care staff from community care homes for people with ID. After completing the field test, we will run a focus group involving participants in the PEP to get feedback on the PEP. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethics approval for this study was waived by the UK Health Regulatory Authority as the study does not collect any patient related information and only include care staff outside the UK NHS.

593461,"Neighborhood Environment, Internet Use and Mental Distress among Older Adults: The Case of Shanghai, China",2021-03-31,"COVID-19 is often characterized by dysregulated inflammatory and immune responses. It has been shown that the Traditional Chinese Medicine formulation Qing-Fei-Pai-Du decoction (QFPDD) is effective in the treatment of the disease, especially for patients in the early stage. Our network pharmacology analyses indicated that many inflammation and immune-related molecules were the targets of the active components of QFPDD, which propelled us to examine the effects of the decoction on inflammation. We found in the present study that QFPDD effectively alleviated dextran sulfate sodium-induced intestinal inflammation in mice. It inhibited the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6 and TNFα, and promoted the expression of anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 by macrophagic cells. Further investigations found that QFPDD and one of its active components wogonoside markedly reduced LPS-stimulated phosphorylation of transcription factor ATF2, an important regulator of multiple cytokines expression. Our data revealed that both QFPDD and wogonoside decreased the half-life of ATF2 and promoted its proteasomal degradation. Of note, QFPDD and wogonoside down-regulated deubiquitinating enzyme USP14 along with inducing ATF2 degradation. Inhibition of USP14 with the small molecular inhibitor IU1 also led to the decrease of ATF2 in the cells, indicating that QFPDD and wogonoside may act through regulating USP14 to promote ATF2 degradation. To further assess the importance of ubiquitination in regulating ATF2, we generated mice that were intestinal-specific KLHL5 deficiency, a CUL3-interacting protein participating in substrate recognition of E3s. In these mice, QFPDD mitigated inflammatory reaction in the spleen, but not intestinal inflammation, suggesting CUL3-KLHL5 may function as an E3 for ATF2 degradation.","Xu, Xin; Xia, Jun; Zhao, Shiyi; Wang, Qun; Ge, Guangbo; Xu, Feng; Liu, Xia; Zhang, Weidong; Yang, Yili",FASEB J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34436790/; https://doi.org/10.1096/fj.202100370rr,625

Patients who died were more likely to present with fever (38.9% vs. 7.3%); low percutaneous oxygen saturation (SpO(2)) (55.6% vs. 7.3%); reduced lymphocytes (72.2% vs. 35.8%) and platelets (27.8% vs. 4.1%); and increased D-dimer (94.4% vs. 42.3%), creatinine (50.0% vs. 22.0%), lactic dehydrogenase (LDH) (77.8% vs. 30.1%), high sensitivity troponin I (hs-TnI) (72.2% vs. 14.6%), and N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) (72.2% vs. 6.5%; all P < 0.05) than patients who recovered. Male sex (odds ratio [OR] = 13.1, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.1 to 160.1, P = 0.044), body temperature > 37.3 °C (OR = 80.5, 95% CI 4.6 to 1407.6, P = 0.003), SpO(2) ≤ 90% (OR = 70.1, 95% CI 4.6 to 1060.4, P = 0.002), and NT-proBNP> 1800 ng/L (OR = 273.5, 95% CI 14.7 to 5104.8, P < 0.0001) were independent risk factors of in-hospital death. CONCLUSIONS: In-hospital fatality among elderly COVID-19 patients can be estimated by sex and on-admission measurements of body temperature, SpO(2), and NT-proBNP.

594801,Life Satisfaction during Forced Social Distancing and Home Confinement Derived from the COVID-19 Pandemic in Spain,2021-02-04,"Background: Research is ongoing to identify an effective way to prevent or treat COVID-19, but thus far these efforts have not yet identified a possible solution. Prior studies indicate the protective role of Ultraviolet-B (UVB) radiation in human health, mediated by vitamin D synthesis. In this study, we empirically outline a negative association of UVB radiation as measured by the ultraviolet index (UVI) with the number of deaths attributed to COVID-19 (COVID-19 deaths). Methods: We carry out an observational study, applying a fixed-effect log-linear regression model to a panel dataset of 64 countries over a period of 78 days (n=4992). We use the cumulative number of COVID-19 deaths and case-fatality rate (CFR) as the main dependent variables to test our hypothesis and isolate UVI effect from potential confounding factors such as underlying time trends, country-specific time-constant and time-varying factors such as weather. Findings: After controlling for time-constant and time-varying factors, we find that a permanent unit increase in UVI is associated with a 2.2 percentage points decline in daily growth rates of cumulative COVID-19 deaths [p < 0.01], as well as a 1.9 percentage points, decline in the daily growth rates of CFR [p < 0.05]. These results represent a significant percentage reduction in terms of the daily growth rates of cumulative COVID-19 deaths (-22.92%) and CFR (-73.08%). Our results are consistent across different model specifications. Interpretation: We find a significant negative association between UVI and COVID-19 deaths, indicating evidence of the protective role of UVB in mitigating COVID-19 deaths. If confirmed via clinical studies, then the possibility of mitigating COVID-19 deaths via sensible sunlight exposure or vitamin D intervention will be very attractive because it is cost-effective and widely available.","Kalippurayil Moozhipurath, R.; Kraft, L.; Skiera, B.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.05.06.20093419v1?rss=1; https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.06.20093419,625

This study aims to assess the effectiveness and safety of a new surgical approach for an OSAS pharyngoplasty with a dorsal palatal flap expansion (PDPFEx). A total of 21 participants (mean age 49.9; mean BMI 32.5) underwent a type III sleep study, an endoscopy of the upper airways, a filled medical history, a visual analog scale for snoring loudness, an Epworth Sleepiness Scale, and a Short Form Health Survey-36 questionnaire. A follow-up re-evaluation was performed 11 ± 4.9 months post-operatively. The study group (4 with moderate, 17 with severe OSAS) showed an improvement in all measured sleep study characteristics (p < 0.05), apnea-hypopnea index (pre-median 45.7 to 29.3 post-operatively, p = 0.009, r = 0.394), oxygen desaturation index (pre-median 47.7 and 23.3 post-operatively, p = 0.0005, r = 0.812), mean oxygen saturation (median 92% pre-operatively and median 94% post-operatively, p = 0.0002, r = 0.812), lowest oxygen saturation (p = 0.0001, r = 0.540) and time of sleep spent with blood oxygen saturation less than 90% (p = 0.0001, r = 0.485). The most commonly reported complications were throat dryness (11 patients) and minor difficulties in swallowing (5 patients transient, 3 patients constant). We conclude that a PDPFEx is a promising new surgical method; however, further controlled studies are needed to demonstrate its safety and efficacy for OSAS treatment in adults.","Olszewska, Ewa; Fiedorczuk, Piotr; Stróżyński, Adam; Polecka, Agnieszka; Roszkowska, Ewa; Woodson, B.

596745,The Bedside Clinical Examination as a key element of the swallowing assessment during the COVID 19 Pandemic,2021-03-04,"BACKGROUND: Acute respiratory infections are a principal cause of illness and mortality especially in young children worldwide. OBJECTIVES: To study the epidemiology and seasonality of viral respiratory infections in hospitalized children (under the age of 16) between September 2012 and August 2016. STUDY DESIGN: Nasopharyngeal swabs or aspirates were collected from 3199 symptomatic patients and then screened with a routine multiplex PCR assay. RESULTS: Respiratory viruses were detected for 1624 (50.8%) of the 3199 children in the study population. Of these, 210 (13.3%) were positive for two viruses, 28 (1.7%) were positive for three, and 3 (0.2%) were positive for four. The viral profile varied with age. Some viruses were significantly more frequent in children under the age of 1 month (such as human respiratory syncytial virus (p < 0.0001)), whereas others were significantly more frequent in children over that age (such as influenza viruses (p < 0.0001) and adenoviruses (p = .0006)). The distribution of viruses is variable over the year depending on the species. However, the atmospheric temperature was rarely found to be a limiting factor in the circulation of respiratory viruses. CONCLUSIONS: our results constitute a detailed description of the distribution of respiratory viruses among hospitalized children over four consecutive years. Our data notably highlight the persistence of non-enveloped viruses and some enveloped viruses throughout the year–regardless of temperature variations.","Fillatre, Adrien; François, Catherine; Segard, Christine; Duverlie, Gilles; Hecquet, Denise; Pannier, Christine; Roussel, Catherine; Zawadzki, Patricia; Brochot, Etienne; Castelain, Sandrine",J Clin Virol,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcv.2018.02.010; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S138665321830043X; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29477833/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S138665321830043X,625

We charted memory B cell receptor-encoded antibodies from 19 COVID-19 convalescent subjects against SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) and found 7 major antibody competition groups against epitopes recurrently targeted across individuals. Inclusion of published and newly determined structures of antibody-S complexes identified corresponding epitopic regions. Group assignment correlated with cross-CoV-reactivity breadth, neutralization potency, and convergent antibody signatures. Although emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern escaped binding by many members of the groups associated with the most potent neutralizing activity, some antibodies in each of those groups retained affinity—suggesting that otherwise redundant components of a primary immune response are important for durable protection from evolving pathogens. Our results furnish a global atlas of S-specific memory B cell repertoires and illustrate properties driving viral escape and conferring robustness against emerging variants.","Tong, Pei; Gautam, Avneesh; Windsor, Ian W.; Travers, Meghan; Chen, Yuezhou; Garcia, Nicholas; Whiteman, Noah B.; McKay, Lindsay G.A.; Storm, Nadia; Malsick, Lauren E.; Honko, Anna N.; Lelis, Felipe J.N.; Habibi, Shaghayegh; Jenni, Simon; Cai, Yongfei; Rennick, Linda J.; Duprex, W.

598999,"COVID-19 and Dentistry: Prevention in Dental Practice, a Literature Review",2020-06-26,"COVID-19 infection has protean systemic manifestations. Experience from previous coronavirus outbreaks, including the current SARS-CoV-2, has shown an augmented risk of thrombosis of both macrovasculature and microvasculature. The former involves both arterial and venous beds manifesting as stroke, acute coronary syndrome and venous thromboembolic events. The microvascular thrombosis is an underappreciated complication of SARS-CoV-2 infection with profound implications on the development of multisystem organ failure. The telltale signs of perpetual on-going coagulation and fibrinolytic cascades underscore the presence of diffuse endothelial damage in the patients with COVID-19. These parameters serve as strong predictors of mortality. While summarizing the alterations of various components of thrombosis in patients with COVID-19, this review points to the emerging evidence that implicates the prominent role of the extrinsic coagulation cascade in COVID-19-related coagulopathy. These mechanisms are triggered by widespread endothelial cell damage (endotheliopathy), the dominant driver of macro- and micro-vascular thrombosis in these patients. We also summarize other mediators of thrombosis, clinically relevant nuances such as the occurrence of thromboembolic events despite thromboprophylaxis (breakthrough thrombosis), current understanding of systemic anticoagulation therapy and its risk–benefit ratio. We conclude by emphasizing a need to probe COVID-19-specific mechanisms of thrombosis to develop better risk markers and safer therapeutic targets.","Kamel, Mohamed Hassan; Yin, Wenqing; Zavaro, Chris; Francis, Jean M.; Chitalia, Vipul C.",Cells,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33142844/; https://doi.org/10.3390/cells9112392,625

More than 21 million adults were residing in the study area (42% of the population). We included 115,945 COVID-19 cases diagnosed during the first wave of the pandemic (February–May, 2020); 34.6% of these had been vaccinated against influenza. Three outcomes were considered: hospitalization, death, and intensive care unit (ICU) admission/death. The adjusted relative risk (RR) of being hospitalized in the vaccinated group when compared with the non-vaccinated group was 0.87 (95% CI: 0.86–0.88). This reduction in risk was not confirmed for death (RR = 1.04; 95% CI: 1.01–1.06), or for the combined outcome of ICU admission or death.

Emerging evidence suggests that pandemic situations and associated lockdowns have an adverse impact on sleep and mental health. However, prediction of sleep health from sociodemographic characteristics and the public’s worry during the initial stages of the COVID-19 pandemic has not been extensively explored so far. It’s also unclear whether sleep outcomes mediate the association between worry and mental health during pandemic situations. A web-survey (N = 391) on sociodemographic characteristics, COVID-19 related worry, sleep health (insomnia and daytime sleepiness), and depression was conducted during the initial 21-days of the COVID-19 stringent lockdown in India. Multiple regression analyses showed that variables, including sex, age, income level, and worry score, contributed to the significant regression equation for insomnia but not for daytime sleepiness. Specifically, the female, younger, lower income, and highly worried populations contributed significantly more than the male, elderly, higher income, and less worried populations, respectively, to the prediction of insomnia. Mediation analyses showed that insomnia, but not daytime sleepiness, fully mediated the relationship between worry score and severity of depressive symptoms. We provide evidence that the female, younger, lower income, and worried populations may be at higher risk for insomnia during pandemic situations. Current evidence gives hope that improving sleep may reduce depressive symptoms during a pandemic situation. This underscores the importance of the implementation of effective public health policies in conjunction with strategical responses to the COVID-19 pandemic.","Bajaj, Sahil; Blair, Karina S.; Schwartz, Amanda; Dobbertin, Matthew; Blair, R.

The exact number of incident cases of emerging infectious diseases on a daily basis is of great importance to the disease control and prevention, but it is not directly available from the current surveillance system in time. WHAT IS ADDED BY THIS REPORT? In this study, a Bayesian statistical method was proposed to estimate the posterior parameters of the gamma probability distribution of the lag time between the onset date and the reporting time based on the surveillance data. And then the posterior parameters and corresponding cumulative gamma probability distribution were used to predict the actual number of new incident cases and the number of unreported cases per day. The proposed method was used for predicting COVID-19 incident cases from February 5 to February 26, 2020. The final results show that Bayesian probability model predictions based on data reported by February 28, 2020 are very close to those actually reported a month later. WHAT ARE THE IMPLICATIONS FOR PUBLIC HEALTH PRACTICE? This research provides a Bayesian statistical approach for early estimation of the actual number of cases of incidence based on surveillance data, which is of great value in the prevention and control practice of epidemics.","Zhang, Yewu; Wang, Xiaofeng; Li, Yanfei; Wu, Siyu; Wan, Ming; Su, Xuemei; Yang, Shigui; Lai, Hanjiang; Jia, Zhongwei; Ma, Jiaqi",China CDC Wkly,https://doi.org/10.46234/ccdcw2020.267; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34594824/,625

Therefore, vaccination of susceptible poultry during an HPAIV outbreak might be the best remedy to prevent such transmissions. To this end, suitable formulations and an effective mass vaccination method that can be translated to field settings needs to be developed. Our previous study in chickens has shown that inhalation of a non-adjuvanted dry powder influenza vaccine formulation during normal breathing results in partial protection against lethal influenza challenge. The aim of the present study was to improve the effectiveness of pulmonary vaccination by increasing the vaccine dose deposited in the lungs and by the use of suitable adjuvants. Two adjuvants, namely, Bacterium-like Particles (BLP) and Advax, were spray freeze dried with influenza vaccine into dry powder formulations. Delivery of dry formulations directly at the syrinx revealed that BLP and Advax had the potential to boost either systemic or mucosal immune responses or both. Upon passive inhalation of dry influenza vaccine formulations in an optimized set-up, BLP and Advax/BLP adjuvanted formulations induced significantly higher systemic immune responses than the non-adjuvanted formulation. Remarkably, all vaccinated animals not only survived a lethal influenza challenge, but also did not show any shedding of challenge virus except for two out of six animals in the Advax group.

603791,Establishing a Theory-Based Multi-Level Approach for Primary Prevention of Mental Disorders in Young People,2020-12-16,"BACKGROUND: Patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) often have coagulation abnormalities. However, the factors that lead to coagulation dysfunction in acute exacerbation of COPD (AECOPD) remain insufficiently explored. This study aimed to investigate the factors affecting coagulation status in patients with COPD and their influence on thrombosis. METHODS: Data of COPD patients, including 135 cases in acute exacerbation stage and 44 cases in stable stage from Nov 2016 to Nov 2019 in our hospital, were collected. Healthy people (n = 135) were enrolled as the controls. The coagulation parameters, blood gas indexes and blood routine examination results were collected and analyzed. RESULTS: White blood count (WBC), neutrophil count, neutrophil percentage (N%), platelet (PLT), prothrombin time (PT), international normalized ratio (INR), fibrinogen (FIB), and activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) increased, plasma thrombin time (TT) decreased in AECOPD group compared with the control group. In AECOPD group, PT, APTT, and FIB were positively correlated with neutrophils and C‐reaction protein levels. PT was positively correlated with PCO2 and negatively with pH. Thrombosis was observed in five acute exacerbation and three stable stage COPD patients. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with AECOPD presented abnormal coagulation status, which was correlated to infection and hypercapnia and might be potentially the risk factor of thrombosis.","Liu, Mei; Hu, Ruixue; Jiang, Xuqin; Mei, Xiaodong",J Clin Lab Anal,https://doi.org/10.1002/jcla.23733; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33764623/,625
604531,"Mental Health of Apprentices during the COVID-19 Pandemic in Austria and the Effect of Gender, Migration Background, and Work Situation",2021-08-25,"In this paper, we explore a rationalistic orientation in Western society. We suggest that this orientation is one of the predominant ways in which Western society tends to frame, understand and deal with a majority of problems and questions – namely in terms of mathematical analysis, calculation and quantification, relying on logic, numbers, and statistics. Our main goal in this paper is to uncover the affective structure of this rationalistic orientation. In doing so, we illustrate how this orientation structures the way not only individuals but society as a whole frames and solves problems. We firstly point towards some exemplary instances of the rationalistic orientation, specifically regarding science, society, and lifeworld practice. Crucially, we argue that the rationalistic orientation is not merely based on a set of beliefs we could easily correct; but rather, that it is an affective condition tacitly shaping our engagement with the world in an encompassing way. Relating to the work of Martin Heidegger, we argue that what we have called an orientation in the beginning is in fact a rationalistic attunement. This attunement fundamentally shapes the pre-reflective level of how individuals approach the world. We elaborate this claim by showing how the rationalistic attunement concretely manifests in tangible socio-material affect dynamics. In the end, we motivate a critical stance towards this attunement, providing the ability to reflect upon and question instances where this way of framing and solving problems is counterproductive.","Schuetze, Paul; von Maur, Imke",Phenomenol Cogn Sci,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11097-021-09728-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33589861/,625
607465,Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Burnout in Primary Care Physicians in Catalonia,2021-08-27,"COVID-19, caused by the SARS-Cov2, varies greatly in its severity but represent serious respiratory symptoms with vascular and other complications, particularly in older adults. The disease can be spread by both symptomatic and asymptomatic infected individuals, and remains uncertainty over key aspects of its infectivity, no effective remedy yet exists and this disease causes severe economic effects globally. For these reasons, COVID-19 is the subject of intense and widespread discussion on social media platforms including Facebook and Twitter. These public forums substantially impact on public opinions in some cases and exacerbate widespread panic and misinformation spread during the crisis. Thus, this work aimed to design an intelligent clustering-based classification and topics extracting model (named TClustVID) that analyze COVID-19-related public tweets to extract significant sentiments with high accuracy. We gathered COVID-19 Twitter datasets from the IEEE Dataport repository and employed a range of data preprocessing methods to clean the raw data, then applied tokenization and produced a word-to-index dictionary. Thereafter, different classifications were employed to Twitter datasets which enabled exploration of the performance of traditional and TClustVID classification methods. TClustVID showed higher performance compared to the traditional classifiers determined by clustering criteria. Finally, we extracted significant topic clusters from TClustVID, split them into positive, neutral and negative clusters and implemented latent dirichlet allocation for extraction of popular COVID-19 topics. This approach identified common prevailing public opinions and concerns related to COVID-19, as well as attitudes to infection prevention strategies held by people from different countries concerning the current pandemic situation.","Satu, Md.

However, the effects of berberine on double-stranded RNA (dsRNA)-induced macrophages have not been fully reported. In this study, we examined the anti-inflammatory effects of berberine on dsRNA [polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid; poly I:C]-induced macrophages. Levels of nitric oxide (NO), Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), first apoptosis signal receptor (Fas; CD95), cytokines, intracellular calcium, phosphorylated I-kappa-B-alpha (IkB-α), phosphorylated p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), phosphorylated ERK1/2, phosphorylated signal transducer and activated transcription 3 (STAT3), and mRNA expression of inflammatory genes in poly I:C-induced RAW 264.7 mouse macrophages were evaluated. Berberine significantly inhibited the production of NO, PGE2, Fas, GM-CSF, LIF, LIX, RANTES, and MIP-2 as well as calcium release in poly I:C-induced RAW 264.7 cells at concentrations of up to 50 μM. Berberine also significantly inhibited the phosphorylation of p38 MAPK, ERK1/2, IkB-α, and STAT3 in poly I:C-induced RAW 264.7 cells. Additionally, berberine significantly decreased the mRNA expressions of Chop (GADD153), Stat1, Stat3, and Fas in poly I:C-induced RAW 264.7 cells.

The study aimed to investigate the changes in lifestyle, access to health services, and mental wellbeing during the first Italian lockdown in a sample of Italian pregnant women and new mothers. METHODS: We carried out a web-based survey to evaluate how pregnant women and new mothers were coping with the lockdown. We collected data about healthy habits (physical exercise and dietary habits), access to health services (care access, delivery and obstetric care, neonatal care, and breastfeeding), and mental wellbeing (psychological well-being and emotive support). Descriptive analysis was performed for both groups of participants, whereas a Poisson analysis was used to measure the association between some structural variables (age, education, socio-economic data, partner support, contact, free time, previous children, and pregnancy trimester) and anxiety or depression, difficulties in healthy eating and reduction in physical activity after lockdown started. Chi2 and Adjusted Prevalence Ratios were estimated only for pregnant women. RESULTS: We included 739 respondents (response rate 85.8 %), 600 were pregnant (81.2 %), and 139 (18.8 %) had delivered during lockdown (new mothers). We found a high score for anxiety and depression in 62.8 % of pregnant women and 61.9 % of new mothers. During the lockdown, 61.8 % of pregnant women reduced their physical exercise, and 44.3 % reported eating in a healthier way. 94.0 % of new mothers reported to have breastfed their babies during the hospital stay. Regarding the perceived impact of restrictive measures on breastfeeding, no impact was reported by 56.1 % of new mothers, whereas a negative one by 36.7 %. CONCLUSIONS: The high prevalence of anxiety and depressive symptoms in pregnant women and new mothers should be a public health issue. Clinicians might also recommend and encourage “home” physical exercise. On the other hand, about half of the sample improved their approach towards healthy eating and a very high breastfeeding rate was reported soon after birth: these data are an interesting starting point to develop new strategies for public health.

The aim of this study is a 9‐month monitoring of SARS‐CoV‐2 infection immune response development and extinction using quantitative assessment of IgA and IgG levels in the blood of healthy donors living in the context of the coronavirus pandemic and of the patients who have undergone COVID‐19. The project involved 180 volunteers, of whom 51 persons (28.33%) fell ill with COVID‐19 during the observation period. All people who underwent COVID‐19 developed a stable humoral immune response but their individual immune status had a number of features. Approximately 39.22% (20 of 51 people) of project participants diagnosed with COVID‐19 showed an unusual change in plasma anti‐SARS‐CoV‐2 IgA levels. Relatively high levels of IgA (ratio ~ 3) after recovery persisted for a long time (more than 6 months). In one‐third (17 of 51 people) of patients with COVID‐19, the IgA level exceeded the IgG level. IgA antibodies appeared earlier and showed a stronger and more robust response to the SARS‐CoV‐2 virus than IgG. Increased levels of anti‐SARS‐CoV‐2 IgA (ratio from 0.8 to 2.36) throughout the observation period were recorded in 28 of 180 project participants (15.56%) of whom only one person fell ill with COVID‐19.","Ivanov, Andrei; Semenova, Elena",J Med Virol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34185312/; https://doi.org/10.1002/jmv.27166,625

Here, we proposed a solution by designing a clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)/Cas9 eraser strategy for eliminating potential contamination amplification. The CRISPR/Cas9 engineered eraser is firstly adopted into artpcr reverse‐transcription PCR (RT‐PCR) system to achieve contamination‐free RNA detection. Subsequently, we extended this CRISPR/Cas9 eraser to the PCR system. We engineered conventional PCR primers to enable the amplified products to contain an implanted NGG (protospacer adjacent motif, PAM) site, which is used as a code for specific CRISPR/Cas9 recognition. Pre‐incubation of Cas9/sgRNA with PCR mix leads to a selective cleavage of contamination amplicons, thus only the template DNA is amplified. The developed CRISPR/Cas9 eraser, adopted by both RT‐PCR and PCR systems, showed high‐fidelity detection of SARS‐CoV‐2 and African swine fever virus with a convenient strip test.","Lin, Wei; Tian, Tian; Jiang, Yongzhong; Xiong, Erhu; Zhu, Debin; Zhou, Xiaoming",Biotechnol Bioeng,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33615437/; https://doi.org/10.1002/bit.27718,625

Many patients with mysterious pneumonia were distinguished in December 2019 in Wuhan. The pneumonia of obscure origin was found to be ascribed to a novel coronavirus and described as novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP). The Chinese authorities initially reported the wave of mysterious pneumonia on December 31st, 2019 and it was declared as an outbreak of international concern on January 30th, 2020. A systematic search of relevant research was conducted, and a total of 58 primary research articles were identified, analyzed, and debated to better understand the hematologic profile in COVID-19 (Coronavirus disease) infection and its clinical implications. All the findings in this article manifest a true impression of the current interpretation of hematological findings of the SARS-COV-2 disease. Pathophysiology of COVID-19 disease can be better interpreted by taking into consideration the hematologic parameters. Clinical implications of the hematologic profile of COVID-19 patients including cytokine storm, coagulation profile, and thrombophilic complications are under-recognized. Therefore, this review focuses on the coagulation profile, cytokine storm, and its treatment options. The role of pre-existing thrombophilia in COVID-19 patients and how it could result in the poor prognosis of the disease is also debated. The recent data suggests that hypercoagulability could be the potential cause of fatalities due to COVID-19. Potential effects of tocilizumab, metronidazole, and ulinastatin in suppressing cytokine storm may help to treat SARS-COV-2 infection.

The aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence of 19 respiratory pathogens in children hospitalized for lower respiratory tract infections during the winter influenza seasons of 2009/2010 and 2010/2011 and to observe a possible impact of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 on the epidemiology of other epidemic viruses. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Specimens were nasopharyngeal aspirates which had been collected from children admitted to the participating hospitals in the area of Mainz, Wiesbaden, and Kiel, Germany, with acute community-acquired lower respiratory tract infections. The specimens were subjected to a previously described multiplex reverse transcription PCR assay to detect the following microorganisms: enterovirus, influenza virus types A and B, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), parainfluenzavirus types 1–4, adenovirus, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydophila pneumoniae, rhinovirus, human metapneumovirus (hMPV), coronavirus OC43 and 229E, influenza A(H1N1)pdm09, Bordetella pertussis, Bordetella parapertussis, and Legionella pneumophila. RESULTS: A total of 3,998 clinical specimens were collected from July 2009 to March 2011, of which 296 were positive for A(H1N1)pdm09. An epidemic of seasonal influenza A or B was not observed in the 2009/2010 season, but a minor epidemic of seasonal influenza B was observed in January/February 2011. Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 coincided with the absence of the seasonal influenza A of former years. The RSV and hMPV epidemics of 2009/2010 erupted several weeks later than expected based on data collected in the PID-ARI-Network during the past 10 years, whereas in the 2010/2011 influenza season they occurred as expected. CONCLUSIONS: The emergence of the novel influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus may have been influenced the epidemiology of other epidemic viruses, such as the RSV and hMPV. No epidemic of seasonal influenza was observed in the 2009/2010 influenza season.","Gröndahl, B.; Ankermann, T.; von Bismarck, P.; Rockahr, S.; Kowalzik, F.; Gehring, S.; Meyer, C.; Knuf, M.; Puppe, W.",Infection,https://doi.org/10.1007/s15010-013-0545-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24150959/,625

Readying supply capacities and establishing isolation areas and areas for suspected cases in the clinics have led to keeping beds free for treating (suspected) COVID-19 cases. It was therefore necessary to temporarily postpone elective surgery. Now, elective care can be gradually resumed with the second phase of the pandemic in Germany. However, it remains the order of the day to adapt pre-, intra- and post-operative procedures to the new COVID-19 conditions while maintaining specialized hygiene measures. This concerns the correct procedure for the use of personal protective materials as well as process adjustment for parallel treatment of positive and negative patients in the central OR, and handling of aerosols in the operating theater, operating room, and surgical site under consideration of staff and patient protection. Although dealing with surgical smoke in the operating theater has long been criticized, COVID-19 is forcing a renaissance in this area. Finally, the choice of surgical method, whether open surgery or minimally invasive procedures, is critical in determining how many colleagues are exposed to the risk of infection from COVID-19 patients, sometimes for hours. Here, robot-assisted surgery can comply with the pandemic’s requirement to “keep your distance” in a unique way, since the surgeon can operate at virtually any distance from the surgical site, at least with regard to aerosol formation and exposure.","Krüger, Colin M.; Kramer, Axel; Türler, Andreas; Riediger, Hartwig",GMS Hyg Infect Control,https://doi.org/10.3205/dgkh000354; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32782898/,625

METHODS: CT findings of 69 patients with COVID-19 were evaluated on initial CT, peak CT, and pre-discharge CT. CT pattern were divided into four types on CT progression. Lesion percentage of pulmonary lobe (lobe score) was graded. Correlation analysis was made between scores and intervals. 53 patients were followed up by CT. RESULTS: Among 69 patients, 33.3% exhibited improvement pattern, 65.2% peak pattern, 1.5% deterioration pattern, and 0% fluctuation pattern. The lobe scores were positively correlated with most of intervals. It was more common to observe consolidation, pleural thickening and pleural effusion on the peak CT, and irregular line and reticulation on pre-discharge CT. The peak-initial interval were shortened when the initial CT with consolidation and pleural thickening. The intervals were extended when the irregular lines appeared on peak CT and reticulation on pre-discharge CT. Among 53 follow-up patients, 37.7% showed normal chest CT, and 62.3% showed viral pneumonia remained that mainly included GGO (100.0%) and irregular lines (33.3%). CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 displayed different appearances on CT as progressing. The peak pattern was the most common progression pattern. The CT appearances showed closely related to the intervals.

Hospital administrations had to provide a prompt response to a rapidly evolving emergency characterized by the necessity of giving access to an enormous number of infected patients, guaranteeing appropriate care to patients in need of other types of treatment, and simultaneously preserving the well-being of healthcare providers. To optimize the diagnostic pathway during the current COVID-19 outbreak, the hospital administration of our tertiary center applied a highly structured framework assigning specific tasks to the different units composing the Department of Imaging. In particular, since the beginning of the pandemic, a mobile CT scanner in a truck was rented and became operative for all patients with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 and another CT was assigned for all suspected cases. The success and efficacy of the management applied by our administration is demonstrated by the fact that during the outbreak, the radiological workflow was never interrupted. In fact, despite the national lockdown only a 29.3% decrease of CT scans occurred compared to the previous year. Moreover, none of the healthcare providers of the Department contracted the infection at work. Thus, according to the experience gained in our center, we recommend to all hospital administrations facing the COVID-19 outbreak to promptly adapt their resources, creating precise and safe pathways for their diagnostic units.","Stramare, Roberto; Carretta, Giovanni; Capizzi, Alfio; Boemo, Deris Gianni; Contessa, Cristina; Motta, Raffaella; De Conti, Giorgio; Causin, Francesco; Giraudo, Chiara; Donato, Daniele",Radiol Med,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11547-020-01231-w; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32500510/,625
619936,What Happened to People with Non-Communicable Diseases during COVID-19: Implications of H-EDRM Policies,2020-08-03,"Antimicrobial resistance is one of the most significant threats to health and economy around the globe and has been compounded by the emergence of COVID-19, raising important consequences for antimicrobial resistance development. Contrary to conventional targeting approaches, the use of biomimetic application via nanoparticles for enhanced cellular targeting, cell penetration and localized antibiotic delivery has been highlighted as a superior approach to identify novel targeting ligands for combatting antimicrobial resistance. Gram-positive bacterial cell walls contain lipoteichoic acid (LTA), which binds specifically to Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) on human macrophages. This phenomenon has the potential to be exploited for the design of biomimetic peptides for antibacterial application. In this study, we have derived peptides from sequences present in human TLR2 that bind to LTA with high affinity. In silico approaches including molecular modelling, molecular docking, molecular dynamics, and thermodynamics have enabled the identification of these crucial binding amino acids, the design of four novel biomimetic TLR2-derived peptides and their LTA binding potential. The outcomes of this study have revealed that one of these novel peptides binds to LTA more strongly and stably than the other three peptides and has the potential to enhance LTA targeting and bacterial cell penetration.","Devnarain, Nikita; Waddad, Ayman Y.; de la Torre, Beatriz G.; Albericio, Fernando; Govender, Thirumala",Biomedicines,https://doi.org/10.3390/biomedicines9081063; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34440267/,625
619969,Protective and Risk Factors of Italian Healthcare Professionals during the COVID-19 Pandemic Outbreak: A Qualitative Study,2021-01-08,"Since early 2020, the whole world has been facing the deadly and highly contagious disease named coronavirus disease (COVID-19) and the World Health Organization declared the pandemic on 11 March 2020. Over 23 million positive cases of COVID-19 have been reported till late August 2020. Medical images such as chest X-rays and Computed Tomography scans are becoming one of the main leading clinical diagnosis tools in fighting against COVID-19, underpinned by Artificial Intelligence based techniques, resulting in rapid decision-making in saving lives. This article provides an extensive review of AI-based methods to assist medical practitioners with comprehensive knowledge of the efficient AI-based methods for efficient COVID-19 diagnosis. Nearly all the reported methods so far along with their pros and cons as well as recommendations for improvements are discussed, including image acquisition, segmentation, classification, and follow-up diagnosis phases developed between 2019 and 2020. AI and machine learning technologies have boosted the accuracy of Covid-19 diagnosis, and most of the widely used deep learning methods have been implemented and worked well with a small amount of data for COVID-19 diagnosis. This review presents a detailed mythological analysis for the evaluation of AI-based methods used in the process of detecting COVID-19 from medical images. However, due to the quick outbreak of Covid-19, there are not many ground-truth datasets available for the communities. It is necessary to combine clinical experts’ observations and information from images to have a reliable and efficient COVID-19 diagnosis. This paper suggests that future research may focus on multi-modality based models as well as how to select the best model architecture where AI can introduce more intelligence to medical systems to capture the characteristics of diseases by learning from multi-modality data to obtain reliable results for COVID-19 diagnosis for timely treatment .","Soomro, Toufique A.; Zheng, Lihong; Afifi, Ahmed J.; Ali, Ahmed; Yin, Ming; Gao, Junbin",Artif Intell Rev,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33875900/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s10462-021-09985-z,625

A rigorous simulation (with analytical argument) is provided to reveal the effective reduction of final outbreak size and peak of infection as a function of basic reproduction number in a single patch. Further, to study the impact of long and short-distance human migration among the patches, we have considered heterogeneous networks where the linear diffusive connectivity is determined by the network link structure. We numerically confirm that implementation of test-kits in the fraction of nodes (patches) having larger degrees or betweenness centralities can reduce the peak of infection (as well as final outbreak size) significantly. A next-generation matrix based analytical treatment is provided to find out the critical transmission probability in the entire network for the onset of epidemics.

In response to this global pandemic, various institutions across the globe had soon issued their prevention guidelines. Governments in the US had also implemented social distancing policies. However, those policies, which were designed to slow the spread of COVID-19, and its compliance, have varied across the states, which led to spatial and temporal heterogeneity in COVID-19 spread. This paper aims to propose a spatio-temporal model for quantifying compliance with the US COVID-19 mitigation policies at a regional level. To achieve this goal, a specific partial differential equation (PDE) is developed and validated with short-term predictions. The proposed model describes the combined effects of transboundary spread among state clusters in the US and human mobilities on the transmission of COVID-19. The model can help inform policymakers as they decide how to react to future outbreaks.","Yamamoto, Nao; Jiang, Bohan; Wang, Haiyan",Infect Dis Model,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2468042721000191; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.idm.2021.02.004; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2468042721000191?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33686377/,625

However, not all the observed effects of vitamin D can be attributed to this sole mechanism, and other cellular targets likely exist but remain to be identified. Our recent discovery that vitamin D is a partial agonist of the Transient Receptor Potential Vanilloid family 1 (TRPV1) channel may provide new insights as to how this important vitamin exerts its biological effects either independently or in addition to the nuclear vitamin D receptor. In this review, we discuss the literature surrounding this apparent discrepancy in vitamin D signaling and compare vitamin D with known TRPV1 ligands with respect to their binding to TRPV1. Furthermore, we provide evidence supporting the notion that this novel vitamin D/TRPV1 axis may explain some of the beneficial actions of this vitamin in disease states where TRPV1 expression and vitamin D deficiency are known to overlap. Finally, we discuss whether vitamin D may also act on other members of the TRP family of ion channels.","Long, Wentong; Johnson, Janyne; Kalyaanamoorthy, Subha; Light, Peter",Channels,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33825665/; https://doi.org/10.1080/19336950.2021.1905248,625

Recent studies report that emergency departments have experienced a significant decline in the number of admitted patients in the early phase of the pandemic. To date, research regarding the influence of COVID-19 on emergency medical services (EMS) is limited. The present study investigates a change in the number and characteristics of EMS missions in the early phase of the pandemic. METHODS: All EMS missions in the Northern Ostrobothnia region, Finland (population 295 500) between 1 March to 30 June 2020 were screened and analyzed as the study group. A control group was composed from the EMS calls between the corresponding months in the years 2016–2019. RESULTS: A total of 74 576 EMS missions were screened for the study. Within the first two months after the first COVID-19 cases in the study area, the decline in the number of EMS missions was 5.7% – 13% compared to the control group average. EMS time intervals (emergency call to dispatch, dispatch, en-route, on-scene and hospital handover) prolonged in the COVID-19 period. Dispatches concerning mental health problems increased most in the study period (+1.2%, p < 0.001). Only eleven confirmed COVID-19 infections were encountered by EMS in the study period. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that the present COVID-19 pandemic and social restrictions lead to changes in the EMS usage. These preliminary findings emphasize the importance of developing new strategies and protocols in response to the oncoming pandemic waves.","Laukkanen, Lauri; Lahtinen, Sanna; Liisanantti, Janne; Kaakinen, Timo; Ehrola, Ari; Raatiniemi, Lasse",Eur J Public Health,https://doi.org/10.1093/eurpub/ckab065; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33856015/,625

As the pandemic continues to spread globally, it is of great significance to understand how COVID-19 affects the stroke care systems in mainland China. METHODS: We retrospectively studied the real-world data of one comprehensive stroke center in mainland China from January to February 2020 and compared it with the data collected during the same period in 2019. We analyzed DTN time, onset-to-door time, severity, effects after treatment, the hospital length of stays, costs of hospitalization, etc., and the correlation between medical burden and prognosis of acute ischemic stroke (AIS) patients. RESULTS: The COVID-19 pandemic was most severe in mainland China in January and February 2020. During the pandemic, there were no differences in pre-hospital or in-hospital workflow metrics (all p>0.05), while the degree of neurological deficit on admission and at discharge, the effects after treatment, and the long-term prognosis were all worse (all p<0.05).

Reported differences in clinical manifestations and outcomes in SARS-CoV-2 infection could be attributed to factors such as virus replication, infiltration of inflammatory cells, and altered cytokine production. Virus-induced aberrant and excessive cytokine production has been linked to the morbidity and mortality of several viral infections. Using a Luminex platform, we investigated plasma cytokine and chemokine levels of 27 analytes from hospitalized asymptomatic (n = 39) and mildly symptomatic (n = 35) SARS-CoV-2-infected patients (in the early phase of infection), recovered individuals (45-60 days postinfection) (n = 40), and uninfected controls (n = 36) from the city of Pune located in the state of Maharashtra in India. Levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α and the chemokine CXCL-10 were significantly higher, while those of the antiviral cytokines IFN-γ and IL-12 p70 were significantly lower in both asymptomatic and mildly symptomatic patients than in controls. Comparison among the patient categories revealed no difference in the levels of the cytokines/chemokines except for CXCL-10 being significantly higher and IL-17, IL-4, and VEGF being significantly lower in the mildly symptomatic patients. Interestingly, levels of all key analytes were significantly lower in recovered individuals than in those in both patient categories. Nevertheless, the level of CXCL10 was significantly higher in the recovered patients than in the controls, indicating that the immune system of SARS-CoV-2 patients may take a longer time to normalize. Our data suggest that IL-6, IL-1β, TNF-α, CXCL-10, and reduced antiviral cytokines could be used as biomarkers of SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Tripathy, Anuradha S.; Vishwakarma, Siddhesh; Trimbake, Diptee; Gurav, Yogesh K.; Potdar, Varsha A.; Mokashi, Nitin D.; Patsute, Sudhir D.; Kaushal, Himanshu; Choudhary, Manohar L.; Tilekar, Bipin N.; Sarje, Prakash; Dange, Varsha S.; Abraham, Priya",Arch Virol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34554303/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s00705-021-05247-z,625

Non-structural protein 1 (NS1) is an essential virulence factor of the highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza virus and of the apoptosis associated with the pathogenesis of H5N1. Previous studies have revealed that the NS1 protein is able to induce apoptosis via an extrinsic pathway. However, it remains unclear whether the intrinsic pathway is also associated with this apoptosis. The present study used a clone of the NS1 gene from avian influenza A/Jiangsu/1/2007 and observed the localization of the NS1 protein and cytochrome c release from mitochondria and the change of mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) in lung cancer cells. Cytotoxicity was detected using an MTT assay and the number of apoptotic cells was counted using a flow cytometer. Following the isolation of mitochondria, western blotting was performed to compare cytochrome c release from the mitochondria in cells before and after apoptosis. The change of MMP was detected using JC-1 staining. Furthermore, the results reveal that the majority of the NS1 protein was localized in the cell nucleus, and that it may induce apoptosis of human lung epithelial cells. The apoptosis occurred with marked cytochrome c release from mitochondria and a change of the MMP. This indicated that the NS1 protein may be associated with apoptosis induced by an intrinsic mitochondrial pathway.","Bian, Qian; Lu, Jing; Zhang, Li; Chi, Ying; Li, Yan; Guo, Hongxiong",Exp Ther Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29067097/; https://doi.org/10.3892/etm.2017.5056,625

Herein, we aimed to systematically review the studies discussing hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) to examine its reported efficacy and adverse events in patients with COVID-19. METHODS: We systematically searched and retrieved the relevant articles using keywords on the online databases, including PubMed, Scopus, Embase, Web of Science, and Cochrane databases up to April 11th, 2021. The retrieved records underwent a two-step title/abstract and full-text screening process, and the eligible papers were identified. National Institutes of health (NIH) quality assessment tool was used for this study. This study was registered in the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO) with ID CRD42021269821. RESULTS: Eight articles from three countries were included. All the included studies had good and fair quality scores, with no poor studies included in this systematic review (Good: n = 5, Fair: n = 3). Studies were divided into clinical trials and case reports/series. Most of the studies used HBOT less than 1.5–2 absolute atmospheres (ATA) for 90 min sessions and thereafter sessions were decreased to 60 min. Trials demonstrated most of the patients recovered after receiving HBOT, and blood oxygen saturation increased after several sessions of HBOT.

Recent studies suggest that dysfunction of the endothelium during COVID-19 may exacerbate these deleterious events by inciting inflammatory and microvascular thrombotic processes. Although controversial, there is evidence that SARS-CoV-2 may infect endothelial cells by binding to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) cellular receptor using the viral Spike protein. In this review, we explore current insights into the relationship between SARS-CoV-2 infection, endothelial dysfunction due to ACE2 downregulation, and deleterious pulmonary and extra-pulmonary immunothrombotic complications in severe COVID-19. We also discuss preclinical and clinical development of therapeutic agents targeting SARS-CoV-2-mediated endothelial dysfunction. Finally, we present evidence of SARS-CoV-2 replication in primary human lung and cardiac microvascular endothelial cells.

In addition, the increasing use of biological therapies will result in more patients at risk of opportunistic infections, albeit to a lesser degree than classic causes of immunocompromise. The type and degree of immune defect dictates the profile of potential opportunistic pathogens; T-cell mediated defects increase the risk of viral (cytomegalovirus and respiratory viruses) and Pneumocystis jirovecii infections, whereas neutrophil defects are associated with bacterial pneumonia and invasive aspergillosis. However, patients often have combinations of immune defects and a wide range of other opportunistic infections can cause pneumonia. The radiological pattern of disease (best assessed by CT scan) and speed of onset also help identify the likely pathogen(s), which can then be supported by targeted investigation including early use of bronchoscopy in selected patients.

We sought to develop a research agenda to understand the short- and long-term mechanisms and impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on children’s healthy development, with the goal of devising and ultimately testing interventions to respond to urgent needs and prepare for future pandemics. DESCRIPTION: The Life Course Intervention Research Network facilitated a series of virtual meetings that included members of 10 Maternal and Child Health (MCH) research programs, their research and implementation partners, as well as family and community representatives, to develop an MCH COVID-19 Research Agenda. Stakeholders from academia, clinical practice, nonprofit organizations, and family advocates participated in four meetings, with 30–35 participants at each meeting. ASSESSMENT: Investigating the impacts of COVID-19 on children’s mental health and ways to address them emerged as the highest research priority, followed by studying resilience at individual and community levels; identifying and mitigating the disparate negative effects of the pandemic on children and families of color, prioritizing community-based research partnerships, and strengthening local, state and national measurement systems to monitor children’s well-being during a national crisis. CONCLUSION: Enacting this research agenda will require engaging the community, especially youth, as equal partners in research co-design processes; centering anti-racist perspectives; adopting a “strengths-based” approach; and integrating young researchers who identify as Black, Indigenous, and People of Color (BIPOC). New collaborative funding models and investments in data infrastructure are also needed.","Dudovitz, Rebecca N.; Russ, Shirley; Berghaus, Mary; Iruka, Iheoma U.; DiBari, Jessica; Foney, Dana M.; Kogan, Michael; Halfon, Neal",Matern Child Health J,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10995-021-03207-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34427834/,625

A series of CPD-NBD adducts have been prepared and systematically studied toward the use in a polymeric material photopatterning platform. By incorporating an optimized CPD-NBD adduct into polymer networks, it is demonstrated that cyclopentadiene may be unveiled upon 365 nm irradiation and subsequently clicked to a variety of maleimides with spatial control under mild reaction conditions and with fast kinetics. Unlike currently available photoinduced Diels-Alder reactions that rely on trapping transient, photocaged dienes, this platform introduces a persistent, yet highly reactive diene after irradiation, enabling the use of photosensitive species such as cyanine dyes to be patterned. To highlight the potential use of this platform in a variety of material applications, we demonstrate two proof-of-concepts: patterned conjugation of multiple dyes into a polyacrylate network and preprogrammed ligation of streptavidin into poly(ethylene glycol) hydrogels.","Bailey, Sophia J; Stricker, Friedrich; Hopkins, Erik; Wilson, Maxwell Z; Read de Alaniz, Javier",ACS appl. mater. interfaces (Online),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34310127/; https://doi.org/10.1021/acsami.1c08670,625

627876,Emotional and Cognitive Responses and Behavioral Coping of Chinese Medical Workers and General Population during the Pandemic of COVID-19,2020-08-26,"BACKGROUND: Lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) is one of the leading cause of death in children under 5 years old around the world between 1980 and 2016. Distinguishing between viral and bacterial infection is challenging when children suffered from LRTI in the absence of pathogen detection. The aim of our study is to analyze the difference of serum β2-microglobulin (β2-MG) between viral LRTI and bacterial LRTI in children. METHODS: This retrospective study included children with LRTI caused by a single pathogen from Yancheng Third People’s Hospital, Yancheng, China, between January 1, 2016 and December 31, 2019. Participants were divided into the younger group (1 year old ≤ age < 3 years old) and the older group (3 years old ≤ age < 5 years old) for subgroup analysis. RESULTS: A total of 475 children with LRTI caused by common respiratory pathogens were identified. In the younger group as well as the older group, the serum level of β2-MG in respiratory syncytial virus, influenza A virus and influenza B virus groups were significantly increased compared to that in the Mycoplasma pneumoniae group. Compared with Streptococcus pneumoniae infection group, the serum β2-MG level of respiratory syncytial virus, influenza A virus and influenza B virus groups were significantly higher in children between 1 and 3 years old. CONCLUSIONS: The serum β2-MG may distinguish viral infection from bacterial infection in children with LRTI.","Cai, Xulong; Xu, Qiaolan; Zhou, Chenrong; Zhou, Li; Yong, Qijun; Mu, Qing; Cheng, Yan; Wang, Jiena; Xie, Jingjing",PeerJ,https://doi.org/10.7717/peerj.9814; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32904447/,625

We first identified four HLA-A*0201-restricted CTL epitopes derived from SARS-CoV using HLA-A*0201 transgenic mice and recombinant adenovirus expressing predicted epitopes. These peptides were coupled to the surface of liposomes, and inoculated into mice. Two of the liposomal peptides were effective for peptide-specific CTL induction, and one of them was efficient for the clearance of vaccinia virus expressing epitopes of SARS-CoV, suggesting that the surface-linked liposomal peptide might offer an effective CTL-based vaccine against SARS.","Ohno, Satoshi; Kohyama, Shunsuke; Taneichi, Maiko; Moriya, Osamu; Hayashi, Hidenori; Oda, Hiroshi; Mori, Masahito; Kobayashi, Akiharu; Akatsuka, Toshitaka; Uchida, Tetsuya; Matsui, Masanori",Vaccine,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X09005313; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0264410X09005313; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19490987/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2009.04.001,625

Disease outbreaks that sweep through a single region can have massive impacts on food supply, while severe outbreaks of human pathogens can disrupt agricultural labor supply or demand for products perceived as ‘unsafe’. Market pressures have generally rewarded production of cash crops for fuel and energy dense, low nutrient processed foods over production of fruits and vegetables for local consumption. Climbing rates of food-related NCDs and pre-existing conditions leave the population increasingly susceptible to infectious diseases that are often driven by or arise from the food system. Therefore disease and diet from our food systems cause impacts on human health, and human health issues can impact on the functioning of the food system. The COVID-19 outbreak is the most recent example of food system driven disease emergence and of massive supply and demand shocks in the food system, experienced as a direct and indirect result of this disease. The effects of the food system on disease spread (and vice versa) must be addressed in future plans to prevent and mitigate large scale outbreaks. Health policies must acknowledge the food system as the base of our health system, as must agri-food policy recognize the pre-eminence of human health (directly and indirectly) in decision making.","Patterson, Grace T.; Thomas, Lian F.; Coyne, Lucy A.; Rushton, Jonathan",Glob Food Sec,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S221191242030078X; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32904586/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.gfs.2020.100424; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S221191242030078X,625

The usage of IoT devices such as smart wearables, smart phones, smart cities are increasing in the linear scale. Health care is one of the primary applications today that uses IoT devices. Data generated in this application may need computation, storage and data analytics operations which requires resourceful environment for remote patient health monitoring. The data related with health care applications are primarily private and should be readily available to the users. Enforcing these two constraints in cloud environment is a hard task. Fog computing is an emergent architecture for providing computation, storage, control and network services within user’s proximity. To handle private data, the processing elements should be trustable entities in Fog environment. In this paper we propose novel Trust Enforced computation ofFLoading technique for trust worthy applications using fOg computiNg (TEFLON). The proposed system comprises of two algorithms namely optimal service offloader and trust assessment for addressing security and trust issues with reduced response time.

630636,How Incivility and Academic Stress Influence Psychological Health among College Students: The Moderating Role of Gratitude,2020-05-06,"BACKGROUND: During the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic, due to the traffic blockade and the shortage of medical resources, more and more premature infants could not receive timely and effective ROP screening, which delayed treatment and even caused children blindness. Therefore, how to carry out ROP screening safely and effectively during the epidemic was very important and urgent. This study aimed to evaluate the safety and feasibility of ROP screening assisted by telemedicine network during COVID-19 outbreak. METHODS: This retrospective study was conducted at Wuhan Children’s hospital in Wuhan, China, from January to October, 2020. The measures which were performed to make the ROP screening more safe and effective were summarized and the comparison between ROP screening assisted by telemedicine network in 2020 and usual screening in 2019 were analyzed. RESULTS: A total of 267 outpatient infants completed ROP screening. The median gestational age was 32 weeks (30w to 34w) and the median birth weight was 1780 g (1460 g to 2100 g). Meanwhile, 149 (55.8%) out of 267 infants were males. During January to May in 2020, 86 screening appointments were received, among which 67 (77.9%) were from telemedicine platform online. The completing percentage of total online ROP appointments was higher than that of total face-to-face appointments (58.1% VS 22. 1%, P = 0.018). As for the number of infants screened between 2020 and 2019 from Februaryto October, 54 infants completed ROP screening in 2020, which was higher than that (51participants) in 2019 on September. Furthermore, compared with the usual screening in 2019, ROP screening assisted by telemedicine network in 2020 had smaller gestational age (32w VS 33w, p<0.001) and lower birth weight (1780 g VS 1900 g, p = 0.001). However, of the 267 infants screened, 18(6.7%) had ROP while the percentage of ROP screened in 2019 was the same (44[6.7%]). During follow-up, none of medical staffs was infected and no adverse reaction was reported. CONCLUSIONS: The screening for retinopathy of prematurity assisted by telemedicine network was safe and feasible during the COVID-19 pandemic. Preventive measures before and after screening were very necessary, which could effectively avoid cross infection.","Guo, Zheng; Ma, Nan; Wu, Yixuan; Yuan, Hua; Luo, Wanjun; Zeng, Lingkong; Jie, Hong; Li, Shilian",BMC Ophthalmol,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12886-021-02018-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34112134/,625

Our SARS-CoV-2 testing group detected the RNA residue on the surface of medical waste with Droplet Digital PCR, and held a meeting to discuss the risks in the laboratory medical waste disposal process. After effective autoclaving, SARS-CoV-2 contaminated on the surface of medical waste bags was killed, but the average concentration of viral RNA residues was still 0.85 copies/cm(2). It would not pose a health risk, but might contaminate the laboratory and affect the test results. When the sterilized medical waste bags were transferred directly by the operators without hand disinfection, re-contamination would happen, which might cause the virus to leak out of the laboratory. Furthermore, we found that sterilization effect monitoring and cooperation among operators were also very important. In summary, we investigated and analyzed the potential safety hazards during the medical waste disposal process in SARS-CoV-2 testing laboratory, and provided reasonable suggestions to ensure the safety of medical waste disposal.","Lv, Jun; Yang, Jin; Xue, Juan; Zhu, Ping; Liu, Lanfang; Li, Shan",Environ Sci Pollut Res Int,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11356-021-13247-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33677664/,625

We prepared E-beacons biocatalytically using the promiscuous “hedgehog” protein-cholesterol ligase, HhC. Instead of cholesterol, HhC attached nanoluciferase site-specifically to mono-sterylated hairpin DNA, prepared in high yield by solid phase synthesis. We tested three potential E-beacon dark quenchers: Iowa Black, Onyx-A, and dabcyl. Prototype E-beacon carrying each of those quenchers provided sequence-specific nucleic acid sensing through turn-on bioluminescence. For practical application, we prepared dabcyl-quenched E-beacons for potential use in detecting the COVID-19 virus, SARS-CoV-2. Targeting the E484 codon of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein, E-beacons (80 × 10(−12) M) reported wild-type SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid at ≥1 × 10(−9) M with increased bioluminescence of 8-fold. E-beacon prepared for the E484K variant of SARS-CoV-2 functioned with similar sensitivity. These E-beacons could discriminate their complementary target from nucleic acid encoding the E484Q mutation of the SARS-CoV-2 Kappa variant. Along with specificity, detection sensitivity with E-beacons is two to three orders of magnitude better than synthetic molecular beacons, rivaling the most sensitive nucleic acid detection agents reported to date.","Zhang, Xiaoyu; Kotikam, Venubabu; Rozners, Eriks; Callahan, Brian P.",bioRxiv,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34494022/; https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.08.30.458287,625

Using both data-driven and hypothesis-driven analyses, we found several dysregulations in immune cell subsets (e.g. decreased proportion of T cells) that are similarly associated with acute SARS-CoV-2 infection and non-COVID-19 related acute illnesses. In contrast, we identified specific differences in myeloid and lymphocyte subsets that are associated with SARS-CoV-2 status (e.g. elevated proportion of ICAM-1+ mature/activated neutrophils, ALCAM+ monocytes, and CD38+CD8+ T cells). A subset of SARS-CoV-2-specific immune alterations correlated with disease severity, disease outcome at 30 days and mortality. Our data provides novel understanding of the immune dysregulation that are specifically associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection among acute care hospitalized patients.

To fulfil its secondary objective, the study evaluates the social media preferences of the selected cohort for promoting their practice, and their extent of professionalism while using social media. METHOD: An electronic questionnaire was developed and administered to all registered dentists and specialists in KSA through the Saudi Dental Association platform. The questionnaire comprised closed-ended items with a choice of predefined answers that covered demographics, reasons for using social media, and the ways in which social networking might affect professionalism. RESULTS: A total of 238 general dental practitioners and specialists from various age groups answered the questionnaire. The data revealed that 41% of the respondents used social media equally for personal, professional, and business purposes. Instagram was the most commonly used social media platform for dental practice promotion, and also regarded as the most powerful platform by all respondents (p = 0.0009). Thirty-four percent of the respondents rarely posted their own clinical cases on social media. However, a significant difference was observed amongst the specialities (p = 0.01).

We assessed two new DNA vaccines expressing premembrane and envelope Zika virus structural proteins. Methods We did two phase 1, randomised, open-label trials involving healthy adult volunteers. The VRC 319 trial, done in three centres, assessed plasmid VRC5288 (Zika virus and Japanese encephalitis virus chimera), and the VRC 320, done in one centre, assessed plasmid VRC5283 (wild-type Zika virus). Eligible participants were aged 18–35 years in VRC19 and 18–50 years in VRC 320. Participants were randomly assigned 1:1 by a computer-generated randomisation schedule prepared by the study statistician. All participants received intramuscular injection of 4 mg vaccine. In VRC 319 participants were assigned to receive vaccinations via needle and syringe at 0 and 8 weeks, 0 and 12 weeks, 0, 4, and 8 weeks, or 0, 4, and 20 weeks. In VRC 320 participants were assigned to receive vaccinations at 0, 4, and 8 weeks via single-dose needle and syringe injection in one deltoid or split-dose needle and syringe or needle-free injection with the Stratis device (Pharmajet, Golden, CO, USA) in each deltoid. Both trials followed up volunteers for 24 months for the primary endpoint of safety, assessed as local and systemic reactogenicity in the 7 days after each vaccination and all adverse events in the 28 days after each vaccination. The secondary endpoint in both trials was immunogenicity 4 weeks after last vaccination. These trials are registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, numbers NCT02840487 and NCT02996461. Findings VRC 319 enrolled 80 participants (20 in each group), and VRC 320 enrolled 45 participants (15 in each group). One participant in VRC 319 and two in VRC 320 withdrew after one dose of vaccine, but were included in the safety analyses. Both vaccines were safe and well tolerated. All local and systemic symptoms were mild to moderate. In both studies, pain and tenderness at the injection site was the most frequent local symptoms (37 [46%] of 80 participants in VRC 319 and 36 [80%] of 45 in VRC 320) and malaise and headache were the most frequent systemic symptoms (22 [27%] and 18 [22%], respectively, in VRC 319 and 17 [38%] and 15 [33%], respectively, in VRC 320). For VRC5283, 14 of 14 (100%) participants who received split-dose vaccinations by needle-free injection had detectable positive antibody responses, and the geometric mean titre of 304 was the highest across all groups in both trials. Interpretation VRC5283 was well tolerated and has advanced to phase 2 efficacy testing.

Adjusted odds ratio with 95% CI was used to declare statistically significant variables on the basis of p value less than 0.05 in the multivariable binary logistic regression model. RESULTS: The overall knowledge and attitude of the community towards COVID19 was 51.85% [95% CI (47.91%-55.78%)] and 53.13% [95% CI (49.20, 57.06%)], respectively. In this study, being married [AOR = 0.60 at 95% CI: (0.42, 0.86)], educational level; primary [AOR = 3.14 at 95% CI: (1.78,5.54)], secondary [AOR = 2.81 at 95% CI: (1.70,4.63)], college and above [AOR = 4.49 at 95% CI: 7.92, 13.98)], and family size [AOR = 1.80, at 95% CI: (1.05, 3.08)] were emerged as statistically significant factors impacting the knowledge of the community about COVID-19. Besides, educational level; primary [AOR = 1.76 at 95% CI: (1.03, 3.01)], secondary [AOR = 1.69 at 95% CI: (1.07, 2.68)], and college & above [AOR = 2.38 at 95% CI: (1.50, 3.79)], and family size; four to six members [AOR = 1.84 at 95% CI (1.27, 2.67)], above seven members [AOR = 1.79 at 95% CI (1.08, 2.96)] were factors identified as significantly attribute for positive attitude of the communities towards COVID-19. CONCLUSION: More than half of the respondents had better knowledge and attitude regarding COVID-19. Higher educational level and larger family size were significant factors predominantly affecting the knowledge and attitude of the communities towards COVID-19.","Taddese, Asefa Adimasu; Azene, Zelalem Nigussie; Merid, Mehari Woldemariam; Muluneh, Atalay Goshu; Geberu, Demiss Mulatu; Kassa, Getahun Molla; Yenit, Melaku Kindie; Tilahun, Sewbesew Yitayih; Gelaye, Kassahun Alemu; Mekonnen, Habtamu Sewunet; Azagew, Abere Woretaw; Wubneh, Chalachew Adugna; Belay, Getaneh Mulualem; Assimamaw, Nega Tezera; Agegnehu, Chilot Desta; Azale, Telake; Tamiru, Animut Tagele; Rade, Bayew Kelkay; Taye, Eden Bishaw; Andualem, Zewudu; Dagne, Henok; Gashaye, Kiros Terefe; Kabito, Gebisa Guyasa; Mekonnen, Tesfaye Hambisa; Daba, Sintayehu; Azanaw, Jember; Adane, Tsegaye; Alemayehu, Mekuriaw",PLoS One,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0248821; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33861758/,625

639373,Impact of COVID-19 on the Anxiety Perceived by Healthcare Professionals: Differences between Primary Care and Hospital Care,2021-03-22,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) caused an outbreak in Wuhan city, China and quickly spread worldwide. Currently, there are no specific drugs or antibodies that claim to cure severe acute respiratory diseases. For SARS-CoV-2, the spike (S) protein recognizes and binds to the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor, allowing viral RNA to enter the host cell. The main protease (Mpro) is involved in the proteolytic process for mature non-structural proteins, and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) is responsible for the viral genome replication and transcription processes. Owing to the pivotal physiological roles in viral invasion and replication, S protein, Mpro, RdRp are regarded as the main therapeutic targets for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). In this review, we carried out an evolutionary analysis of SARS-CoV-2 in comparison with other mammal-infecting coronaviruses that have sprung up in the past few decades and described the pathogenic mechanism of SARS-CoV-2. We displayed the structural details of S protein, Mpro, and RdRp, as well as their complex structures with different chemical inhibitors or antibodies. Structural comparisons showed that some neutralizing antibodies and small molecule inhibitors could inhibit S protein, Mpro, or RdRp. Moreover, we analyzed the structural differences between SARS-CoV-2 ancestral S protein and D614G mutant, which led to a second wave of infection during the recent pandemic. In this context, we outline the methods that might potentially help cure COVID-19 and provide a summary of effective chemical molecules and neutralizing antibodies.","Ning, Shuo; Yu, Beiming; Wang, Yanfeng; Wang, Feng",Front Cell Infect Microbiol,https://doi.org/10.3389/fcimb.2021.676451; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34222046/,625

Moreover, any correlations between the insomnia condition and the flexible attitude to eat have been investigated. METHODS An online questionnaire was administered in October 2020, including the socio-demographic section, the insomnia condition assessment, and the behavioral flexibility evaluation to develop an eating disorder. RESULTS 341 Italian nurses answered the questionnaire. Regarding the insomnia condition levels, nurses belonging to regions with a higher incidence rate of the Covid-19 pandemic recorded higher levels of insomnia than others (p=.004). Females and nurses belonging to areas with lower Covid-19 incidence rate recorded a significantly higher total eating flexibility attitude (p=.003; p<.001), also, in the Food and Exercise flexibility (p=.007; p<.001). As regards the flexible attitude for weight and shape, significant differences were recorded among nurses according to their BMI values (p<.001) and to their incidence rate of the belonging region (p<.001). The insomnia condition levels significantly correlated with the eat flexibility attitude both in its total score (p=.010), in the general score (p=.010), and the weight and shape score (p<.001). All correlations between the insomnia conditions and the flexibility to eat were significantly inverse except for the food and exercise dimension. All the eat flexibility sub-dimensions significantly correlated among them (p<.001). CONCLUSION There was a direct correlation among socio-demographic factors, BMI values, insomnia, and behavioral flexibility scores in Italian nurses. So, it could be assumed that the nursing profession is at risk of developing a metabolic syndrome condition. Therefore, it could be considered a psychoendocrinological employment disease during the Covid-19 outbreak.","Vitale, Elsa; Galatola, Vito; Mea, Rocco; Dio, Francesca Di; Canonico, Anna","Endocrine, metabolic & immune disorders drug targets",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34269670/; https://doi.org/10.2174/1871530321666210715125939,625

This research sought to unveil and explore the determinant factors associated with health education utilization as a key aspect in basic public health services for migrants in Beijing, China. METHODS: A sample of 863 inter-provincial migrants, 18 years old and above, was selected by three-stage stratified cluster sampling method in urban-rural fringe areas of Beijing during 2016 to 2017. Face-to-face structured interviews were conducted in the questionnaire survey. The effects of the explanatory variables on health education utilization from predisposing, enabling, health behaviors and need variables were used to demonstrate by Anderson health service utilization model. RESULTS: The study revealed that 61.6% migrants desired to receive health education, while only 53.8% of them received in the past year. There were differences in the utilization and needs of health education among the migrants in different ages and genders. Many migrants desired to gain access to various types of health education information from the internet. Chi-square independence test lists such major determinant factors in migrants whole health education as age, “Hukou” registration system, marital status, education level, long-term residence plan in Beijing, one or more children in Beijing, employment status, housing source, average daily working time, exercises, health knowledge, smoking, self-rated health. The binary logistic regression indicates that the migrants with younger age, high education level, one or more children in Beijing, exercises and good self-rated health were more likely to receive whole health education. The results also show that average daily working time of enabling variables and exercise of health behavior variables were the strong and consistent determinants of three types of health education utilization, including communicable, non-communicable and occupational diseases. CONCLUSION: Gaps exist between the needs and utilization in health education and more attention should be given to the migrants with heavy workload and low education level. Feasible policies and measures, such as multiple health information channels, should be vigorously implemented to ensure equitable and easy access to health education for migrants.

In contrast, non-structural proteins encoded by two-thirds of viral genome are poorly characterized for cell-mediated immunity. We previously demonstrated that nucleocapsid-derived peptides chemically coupled to the surface of liposomes effectively elicited SARS-CoV-specific CTLs in mice. Here, we attempted to identify HLA-A*0201-restricted CTL epitopes derived from a non-structural polyprotein 1a (pp1a) of SARS-CoV, and investigated whether liposomal peptides derived from pp1a were effective for CTL induction. Out of 30 peptides predicted on computational algorithms, nine peptides could significantly induce interferon gamma (IFN-γ)-producing CD8(+) T cells in mice. These peptides were coupled to the surface of liposomes, and inoculated into mice. Six liposomal peptides effectively induced IFN-γ-producing CD8(+) T cells and seven liposomal peptides including the six peptides primed CTLs showing in vivo killing activities. Further, CTLs induced by the seven liposomal peptides lysed an HLA-A*0201 positive cell line expressing naturally processed, pp1a-derived peptides. Of note, one of the liposomal peptides induced high numbers of long-lasting memory CTLs. These data suggest that surface-linked liposomal peptides derived from pp1a might offer an efficient CTL-based vaccine against SARS.","Kohyama, Shunsuke; Ohno, Satoshi; Suda, Tatsuya; Taneichi, Maiko; Yokoyama, Shoichi; Mori, Masahito; Kobayashi, Akiharu; Hayashi, Hidenori; Uchida, Tetsuya; Matsui, Masanori",Antiviral Res,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166354209004574; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19748524/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0166354209004574; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.antiviral.2009.09.004,625

While preliminary choices were essentially based on in vitro potency, clinical translation into effective therapies may be challenging due to unfavorable in vivo pharmacokinetic properties at the doses chosen for this new indication of COVID-19 infection. However, available pharmacokinetic and pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic studies suffer from severe limitations leading to unreliable conclusions, especially in term of dosing optimization. In this paper we propose to highlight these limitations and to identify some of the major requirements that need to be addressed in designing PK and PK-PD studies in this era of COVID. A special attention should be paid to pre-analytical and analytical requirements and to the proper collection of covariates affecting dose-exposure relationships (co-medications, use of specific organ support techniques and other clinical and para-clinical data). We also promote the development of population PK and PK-PD models specifically dedicated to COVID-19 patients since those previously developed for other diseases (SEL, malaria, HIV) and clinical situations (steady-state, non-ICU patients) are not representative of severe patients. Therefore, implementation of well-designed PK and PD studies targeted to COVID-19 patients is urgently needed. For that purpose we call for multi-institutional collaborative work and involvement of clinical pharmacologists in multidisciplinary research consortia.","Venisse, Nicolas; Peytavin, Gilles; Bouchet, Stephane; Gagnieu, Marie-Claude; Garraffo, Rodolphe; Guilhaumou, Romain; Solas, Caroline",Antiviral Res,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0166354220302801; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32659293/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166354220302801?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.antiviral.2020.104866,625
645123,Nurse Training in Gender-Based Violence Using Simulated Nursing Video Consultations during the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Qualitative Study,2020-11-21,"BACKGROUND: Forecasting methods rely on trends and averages of prior observations to forecast COVID-19 case counts. COVID-19 forecasts have received much media attention, and numerous platforms have been created to inform the public. However, forecasting effectiveness varies by geographic scope and is affected by changing assumptions in behaviors and preventative measures in response to the pandemic. Due to time requirements for developing a COVID-19 vaccine, evidence is needed to inform short-term forecasting method selection at county, health district, and state levels. OBJECTIVE: COVID-19 forecasts keep the public informed and contribute to public policy. As such, proper understanding of forecasting purposes and outcomes is needed to advance knowledge of health statistics for policy makers and the public. Using publicly available real-time data provided online, we aimed to evaluate the performance of seven forecasting methods utilized to forecast cumulative COVID-19 case counts. Forecasts were evaluated based on how well they forecast 1, 3, and 7 days forward when utilizing 1-, 3-, 7-, or all prior–day cumulative case counts during early virus onset. This study provides an objective evaluation of the forecasting methods to identify forecasting model assumptions that contribute to lower error in forecasting COVID-19 cumulative case growth. This information benefits professionals, decision makers, and the public relying on the data provided by short-term case count estimates at varied geographic levels. METHODS: We created 1-, 3-, and 7-day forecasts at the county, health district, and state levels using (1) a naïve approach, (2) Holt-Winters (HW) exponential smoothing, (3) a growth rate approach, (4) a moving average (MA) approach, (5) an autoregressive (AR) approach, (6) an autoregressive moving average (ARMA) approach, and (7) an autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) approach. Forecasts relied on Virginia’s 3464 historical county-level cumulative case counts from March 7 to April 22, 2020, as reported by The New York Times. Statistically significant results were identified using 95% CIs of median absolute error (MdAE) and median absolute percentage error (MdAPE) metrics of the resulting 216,698 forecasts. RESULTS: The next-day MA forecast with 3-day look-back length obtained the lowest MdAE (median 0.67, 95% CI 0.49-0.84, P<.001) and statistically significantly differed from 39 out of 59 alternatives (66%) to 53 out of 59 alternatives (90%) at each geographic level at a significance level of .01. For short-range forecasting, methods assuming stationary means of prior days’ counts outperformed methods with assumptions of weak stationarity or nonstationarity means. MdAPE results revealed statistically significant differences across geographic levels. CONCLUSIONS: For short-range COVID-19 cumulative case count forecasting at the county, health district, and state levels during early onset, the following were found: (1) the MA method was effective for forecasting 1-, 3-, and 7-day cumulative case counts; (2) exponential growth was not the best representation of case growth during early virus onset when the public was aware of the virus; and (3) geographic resolution was a factor in the selection of forecasting methods.","Lynch, Christopher J; Gore, Ross",J Med Internet Res,https://doi.org/10.2196/24925; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33621186/,625

Already in the past, the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003 and Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome (MERS) in 2012 demonstrates the potential of coronaviruses to cross-species borders and further underlines the importance of identifying new-targeted drugs. An ideal antiviral agent should target essential proteins involved in the lifecycle of SARS-CoV. Currently, some HIV protease inhibitors (i.e., Lopinavir) are proposed for the treatment of COVID-19, although their effectiveness has not yet been assessed. The main protease (M(pro)) provides a highly validated pharmacological target for the discovery and design of inhibitors. We identified potent M(pro) inhibitors employing computational techniques that entail the screening of a Marine Natural Product (MNP) library. MNP library was screened by a hyphenated pharmacophore model, and molecular docking approaches. Molecular dynamics and re-docking further confirmed the results obtained by structure-based techniques and allowed this study to highlight some crucial aspects. Seventeen potential SARS-CoV-2 M(pro) inhibitors have been identified among the natural substances of marine origin. As these compounds were extensively validated by a consensus approach and by molecular dynamics, the likelihood that at least one of these compounds could be bioactive is excellent.","Gentile, Davide; Patamia, Vincenzo; Scala, Angela; Sciortino, Maria Teresa; Piperno, Anna; Rescifina, Antonio",Mar Drugs,https://doi.org/10.3390/md18040225; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32340389/,625

Due to insufficient diagnostic testing in the United States, there is a need for clinical decision-making algorithms to guide testing prioritization. METHODS: We recruited participants nationwide for a randomized clinical trial. We categorized participants into three groups: 1) those with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, 2) those with probable SARS-CoV-2 infection (pending test or not tested but with a confirmed COVID-19 contact), and 3) those with possible SARS-CoV-2 infection (pending test or not tested and with a contact for whom testing was pending or not performed). We compared the frequency of self-reported symptoms in each group and categorized those reporting symptoms in early infection (0 – 2 days), mid-infection (3 – 5 days), and late infection (>5 days). RESULTS: Among 1,252 symptomatic persons screened, 316 had confirmed, 393 had probable, and 543 had possible SARS-CoV-2 infection. In early infection, those with confirmed and probable SARS-CoV-2 infection shared similar symptom profiles, with fever most likely in confirmed cases (p = 0.002). Confirmed cases did not show any statistically significant differences compared to unconfirmed cases in symptom frequency at any time points. The most commonly reported symptoms in those with confirmed infection were cough (82%), fever (67%), fatigue (62%), and headache (60%), with only 52% reporting both fever and cough.

646986,Public Protests and the Risk of Novel Coronavirus Disease Hospitalizations: A County-Level Analysis from California,2021-09-08,"Several forms of cardiovascular involvement have been described in patients with Coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19): myocardial injury, acute coronary syndrome, acute heart failure, myocarditis, pericardial diseases, arrhythmias, takotsubo syndrome, and arterial and venous atherothrombotic and thromboembolic events. Data on long-term outcome of these patients are still sparse, and the type and real incidence of cardiovascular sequelae are poorly known. It is plausible that myocardial injury may be the initiator of an inflammatory cascade, edema, and subsequent fibrosis, but also a consequence of systemic inflammation. The extent and distribution of ongoing inflammation may be the basis for ventricular dysfunction and malignant arrhythmias. Indeed, preliminary observational findings seem to emphasize the importance of close monitoring of COVID-19 patients with myocardial injury after discharge. Residual subclinical disease may be effectively investigated by using second-level imaging modalities such as cardiac magnetic resonance, which allows better characterization of the type and extension of myocardial damage, as well as of the ongoing inflammation after the acute phase. In patients with venous thromboembolism, a very common complication of COVID-19, the type and the duration of anticoagulation therapy after the acute phase should be tailored to the patient and based on the estimation of the individual thromboembolic and hemorrhagic risk. Large randomized clinical trials are ongoing to address this clinical question. Whether the severity of cardiovascular involvement, the type of treatments adopted during the acute phase, and the hemodynamic response, may influence the long-term outcome of patients recovered from COVID-19 is unknown. An etiological diagnosis of myocardial injury during the hospitalization is the first step for an appropriate follow-up in these patients. After discharge, the screening for residual left and right ventricular dysfunction, arrhythmias, residual thrombosis, and myocardial scar should be considered on a case-by-case basis, whereas an active clinical surveillance is mandatory in any patient.","Polito, Maria Vincenza; Silverio, Angelo; Bellino, Michele; Iuliano, Giuseppe; Di Maio, Marco; Alfano, Carmine; Iannece, Patrizia; Esposito, Nicolino; Galasso, Gennaro",Cardiol Ther,https://doi.org/10.1007/s40119-021-00232-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34191268/,625
647123,Tendency to Worry and Fear of Mental Health during Italy’s COVID-19 Lockdown,2020-08-15,"[Image: see text] SARS-CoV-2, a novel coronavirus causing overwhelming death and infection worldwide, has emerged as a pandemic. Compared to its predecessor SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 is more infective for being highly contagious and exhibiting tighter binding with host angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE-2). The entry of the virus into host cells is mediated by the interaction of its spike protein with hACE-2. Thus, a peptide that has a resemblance to hACE-2 but can overpower the spike protein–hACE-2 interaction will be a potential therapeutic to contain this virus. The non-interacting residues in the receptor-binding domain of hACE-2 have been mutated to generate a library of 136 new peptides. Out of this library, docking and virtual screening discover seven peptides that can exert a stronger interaction with the spike protein than hACE-2. A peptide derived from simultaneous mutation of all the non-interacting residues of hACE-2 yields almost three-fold stronger interaction than hACE-2 and thus turns out here to be the best peptide inhibitor of the novel coronavirus. The binding of the best peptide inhibitor with the spike protein is explored further by molecular dynamics, free energy, and principal component analysis, which demonstrate its efficacy compared to hACE-2. The delivery of the screened inhibitors with nanocarriers like metal–organic frameworks will be worthy of further consideration to boost their efficacy.","Panda, Saroj Kumar; Sen Gupta, Parth Sarthi; Biswal, Satyaranjan; Ray, Abhik Kumar; Rana, Malay Kumar",J Proteome Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33472369/; https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jproteome.0c00686,625

Nowadays, COVID-19 has spread to several countries around the world and is presently a major global concern. It appears that no certain effective pharmaceutical agent is currently available for it. It seems that obesity is one of the biggest risk factors related to COVID-19 hospitalization and critical illness. The strengthening of the body systems by non-drug ways is very important especially in obese people. On the basis of some indirect evidence, it seems that moderate physical activity can be recommended as a non-pharmacological, inexpensive, and viable way to cope with corona. On the other hand, recommending higher intensity exercise needs further consideration to make final decision in this regard.","Rahmati-Ahmadabad, Saleh; Hosseini, Fahimeh",Obes Med,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2451847620300658; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451847620300658?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.obmed.2020.100245; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32342019/,625
648412,"Knowledge, Emotions and Stressors in Front-Line Healthcare Workers during the COVID-19 Outbreak in Mexico",2021-05-25,"Recent studies reported the presence of pre-existing autoantibodies (auto-Abs) neutralizing type I interferons (IFNs) in at least 15% of patients with critical or severe COVID-19 pneumonia. In one study, these auto-Abs were found in almost 20% of deceased patients across all ages. We aimed to assess the prevalence and clinical impact of the auto-Abs to type I IFNs in Seine-Saint-Denis district, which was one of the most affected areas by COVID-19 in France during the first wave. We tested for the presence of auto-Abs neutralizing type I IFNs in a cohort of patients admitted for critical COVID-19 pneumonia during the first wave in the spring of 2020 in medicine departments at Robert Ballanger Hospital, Aulnay sous Bois. We found circulating auto-Abs that neutralized 100 pg/mL IFN-α2 and/or IFN-ω in plasma 1/10 in 7.9% (11 of 139) of patients hospitalized for critical COVID-19. The presence of neutralizing auto-Abs was associated with an increased risk of mortality as these auto-Abs were detected in 21% of patients who died from COVID-19 pneumonia. Deceased patients with and without auto-Abs did not present overt clinical differences. These results confirm both the importance of IFN-I immunity in host defense against SARS-CoV-2 infection and the usefulness of detection of auto-Abs neutralizing type I IFNs in the management of patients.","Chauvineau-Grenier, Angélique; Bastard, Paul; Servajean, Antoine; Gervais, Adrian; Rosain, Jérémie; Jouanguy, Emmanuelle; Cobat, Aurélie; Casanova, Jean-Laurent; Rossi, Benjamin",Res Sq,https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-915062/v1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34611657/,625

649494,Poor Sleep Quality and Daytime Sleepiness in Health Professionals: Prevalence and Associated Factors,2021-06-26,"The crisis caused by Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has led us to safeguard ourselves and our colleagues against transmission of this highly contagious infection, while aiming for the same goals of care. In spite of the stringent measures adopted by affected countries, rising number of healthcare workers (HCWs) are getting infected, dwindling the scarce manpower at our disposal. In the pre-COVID-19 times, cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) was offered unhesitantly to all patients, who had even a slim chance of achieving return of spontaneous circulation. In COVID-19 era, CPR, due to some components being high aerosol-generating procedures (AGPs), has become high-risk procedure for the HCWs. Instead of “Primum non nocere” (first do no harm), we are forced to change to “Primum non nocere ad te” (first do no harm to yourself). The challenge is therefore to provide best possible chance of survival to deserving patients, whose COVID-19 status might be unknown, without causing harm to the HCWs. In this review, we discuss the current data regarding infected HCWs, outcomes of inhospital and out-of-hospital cardiac arrests, components of CPR which are high-risk AGPs, how to safeguard the HCWs while offering CPR, and the ethical considerations when CPR is considered, in this COVID-19 era. We wish to emphasize here that there is NO EMERGENCY in a pandemic, and time must be made for donning appropriate PPE. We feel that clear policies need to be developed by the institutions to deliver CPR to correct population, in this challenging period. How to cite this article: Kulkarni AP, Singh Y, Garg H, Jha S.

Here, we systematically characterized the transcription levels of the SARS-CoV-2 genes and identified the responsive human genes associated with virus infection. We inferred the possible biological functions of each viral gene and depicted the functional landscape based on guilt-by-association and functional enrichment analyses. Subsequently, the transcription factor regulatory network, protein–protein interaction network, and non-coding RNA regulatory network were constructed to discover more potential antiviral targets. In addition, several potential drugs for COVID-19 treatment and prevention were recognized, including known cell proliferation-related, immune-related, and antiviral drugs, in which proteasome inhibitors (bortezomib, carfilzomib, and ixazomib citrate) may play an important role in the treatment of COVID-19.

In just a few months, the consequences of the pandemic have left their mark on the affected countries at all levels and without exception. This article analyses the profile of food safety notifications reported by European countries in the first five months of 2020. The aim was to detect possible changes in food safety regulations imposed by control authorities that could aggravate the economic impacts of the pandemic. While COVID-19 does not appear to be a foodborne disease, some outbreaks have been linked to imported food, which might have affected the food control behaviour of importing countries. In this study, contingency tables and clustering were used to assess differences between years and notification characteristics and to detect homogeneous groups to help identify how the reported notifications might have changed. In the period considered in this study, the volume of notifications on most imported foodstuffs decreased considerably. This decrease was a direct consequence of the fall in international trade, which might have increased countries' reliance on domestic sources. The COVID-19 crisis has not caused a substantial change in the profile of European countries’ in terms of the characteristics of reported notifications (product category and risk decision). However, the worst affected countries have replaced border rejections with alerts, which may indicate greater reliance on intra-EU markets.","Marti, Luisa; Puertas, Rosa; García-Álvarez-Coque, Jose M.",Food Control,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.foodcont.2021.107952; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0956713521000906; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0956713521000906?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33584020/,625
650895,Psychological Impact of COVID-19 on People with Pre-Existing Chronic Disease,2021-06-02,"Next generation sequencing (NGS)-based studies have vastly increased our understanding of viral diversity. Viral sequence data obtained from NGS experiments are a rich source of information, these data can be used to study their epidemiology, evolution, transmission patterns, and can also inform drug and vaccine design. Viral genomes, however, represent a great challenge to bioinformatics due to their high mutation rate and forming quasispecies in the same infected host, bringing about the need to implement advanced bioinformatics tools to assemble consensus genomes well-representative of the viral population circulating in individual patients. Many tools have been developed to preprocess sequencing reads, carry-out de novo or reference-assisted assembly of viral genomes and assess the quality of the genomes obtained. Most of these tools however exist as standalone workflows and usually require huge computational resources. Here we present (Viral Genomes Easily Analyzed), a Snakemake workflow for analyzing RNA viral genomes. VGEA enables users to map sequencing reads to the human genome to remove human contaminants, split bam files into forward and reverse reads, carry out de novo assembly of forward and reverse reads to generate contigs, pre-process reads for quality and contamination, map reads to a reference tailored to the sample using corrected contigs supplemented by the user’s choice of reference sequences and evaluate/compare genome assemblies. We designed a project with the aim of creating a flexible, easy-to-use and all-in-one pipeline from existing/stand-alone bioinformatics tools for viral genome analysis that can be deployed on a personal computer. VGEA was built on the Snakemake workflow management system and utilizes existing tools for each step: fastp (Chen et al., 2018) for read trimming and read-level quality control, BWA (Li & Durbin, 2009) for mapping sequencing reads to the human reference genome, SAMtools (Li et al., 2009) for extracting unmapped reads and also for splitting bam files into fastq files, IVA (Hunt et al., 2015) for de novo assembly to generate contigs, shiver (Wymant et al., 2018) to pre-process reads for quality and contamination, then map to a reference tailored to the sample using corrected contigs supplemented with the user’s choice of existing reference sequences, SeqKit (Shen et al., 2016) for cleaning shiver assembly for QUAST, QUAST (Gurevich et al., 2013) to evaluate/assess the quality of genome assemblies and MultiQC (Ewels et al., 2016) for aggregation of the results from fastp, BWA and QUAST.

This study aimed to assess ED nurses' burnout level during an outbreak of MERS-CoV and to identify influencing factors in order to provide basic information for lowering and preventing the level of burnout. METHODS: Study participants were ED nurses working in eight hospitals designated for treating MERS-CoV-infected patients in Korea. We performed multiple regression analysis to explore the factors influencing burnout. RESULTS: The ED nurses' burnout was affected by job stress (β = 0.59, p < .001), poor hospital resources for the treatment of MERS-CoV (β = −0.19, p < .001) and poor support from family and friends (β = −0.14, p < .05). These three variables explained 47.3% of the variance in burnout. CONCLUSIONS: ED nurses taking care of MERS-CoV-infected patients should be aware that burnout is higher for nurses in their divisions than nurses in other hospital departments and that job stress is the biggest influential factor of burnout. To be ready for the outbreak of emerging contagious diseases such as MERS-CoV, efforts and preparations should be made to reduce burnout. Job stress should be managed and resolved. Working conditions for mitigating job stress and systematic stress management programs should be provided, and hospital resources for the treatment of MERS-CoV need to be reinforced.

Our first aim was to determine both the infection status and seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in health workers. Our second aim was to evaluate the occupational and demographic predictors of seropositivity to inform the country’s infection prevention and control (IPC) strategy. METHODS AND PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We invited 713 staff members at 24 out of 35 health facilities in the City of Bulawayo in Zimbabwe. Compliance to testing was defined as the willingness to uptake COVID-19 testing by answering a questionnaire and providing samples for both antibody testing and PCR testing. SARS-COV-2 antibodies were detected using a rapid diagnostic test kit and SAR-COV-2 infection was determined by real-time (RT)-PCR. Of the 713 participants, 635(89%) consented to answering the questionnaire and providing blood sample for antibody testing while 560 (78.5%) agreed to provide nasopharyngeal swabs for the PCR SARS-CoV-2 testing. Of the 635 people (aged 18–73) providing a blood sample 39.1% reported a history of past COVID-19 symptoms while 14.2% reported having current symptoms of COVID-19. The most-prevalent co-morbidity among this group was hypertension (22.0%) followed by asthma (7.0%) and diabetes (6.0%). The SARS-CoV-2 sero-prevalence was 8.9%. Of the 560 participants tested for SARS-CoV-2 infection, 2 participants (0.36%) were positive for SAR-CoV-2 infection by PCR testing. None of the SARS-CoV-2 antibody positive people were positive for SAR-CoV-2 infection by PCR testing. CONCLUSION AND INTERPRETATION: In addition to clinical staff, several patient-facing health workers were characterised within Zimbabwe’s health system and the seroprevalence data indicated that previous exposure to SAR-CoV-2 had occurred across the full spectrum of patient-facing staff with nurses and nurse aides having the highest seroprevalence. Our results highlight the need for including the various health workers in IPC strategies in health centres to ensure effective biosecurity and biosafety.","Rusakaniko, Simbarashe; Sibanda, Elopy Nemele; Mduluza, Takafira; Tagwireyi, Paradzayi; Dhlamini, Zephaniah; Ndhlovu, Chiratidzo Ellen; Chandiwana, Precious; Chiwambutsa, Shingirai; Lim, Rivka May; Scott, Fiona; Sibanda, Lindiwe Majele; Mutapi, Francisca",PLoS Negl Trop Dis,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0009254; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33788840/,625

Based on a sample of 76 different countries, we find that an increase in BMI adversely affects the stock returns and increases stock volatility. We also find that an increase in BMI coupled with an increase in percentage cases of COVID-19 adversely affect stock returns and increases volatility. We find that the impacts of BMI on stock returns and volatility are driven by real GDP changes, unemployment rate, and long-term interest rate instead of inflation rates, especially for the developed countries. Our findings are consistent with Barro (1999), which indicates that the BMI represents a better measure relative to the original misery index in predicting the economic outcome, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic. We also find that the impacts of BMI components on stock returns and volatility for the developed countries are different from the emerging markets.","Sergi, Bruno S.; Harjoto, Maretno Agus; Rossi, Fabrizio; Lee, Robert",Financ Res Lett,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.frl.2021.101923; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1544612321000040; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1544612321000040; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34566532/,625

Despite evidence that falls can be prevented by fall prevention programmes, practical barriers may challenge the implementation of these programmes. In this study, we will investigate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of In Balance, a fourteen-week, low-cost group fall prevention intervention, that is widely implemented in community-dwelling older adults with an increased fall risk in the Netherlands. Moreover, we will be the first to include cost-effectiveness for this intervention. Based on previous evidence of the In Balance intervention in pre-frail older adults, we expect this intervention to be (cost-)effective after implementation-related adjustments on the target population and duration of the intervention. METHODS: This study is a single-blinded, multicenter randomized controlled trial. The target sample will consist of 256 community-dwelling non-frail and pre-frail adults of 65 years or older with an increased risk of falls. The intervention group receives the In Balance intervention as it is currently widely implemented in Dutch healthcare, which includes an educational component and physical exercises. The physical exercises are based on Tai Chi principles and focus on balance and strength. The control group receives general written physical activity recommendations. Primary outcomes are the number of falls and fall-related injuries over 12 months follow-up. Secondary outcomes consist of physical performance measures, physical activity, confidence, health status, quality of life, process evaluation and societal costs. Mixed model analyses will be conducted for both primary and secondary outcomes and will be stratified for non-frail and pre-frail adults. DISCUSSION: This trial will provide insight into the clinical and societal impact of an implemented Dutch fall prevention intervention and will have major benefits for older adults, society and health insurance companies. In addition, results of this study will inform healthcare professionals and policy makers about timely and (cost-)effective prevention of falls in older adults.

Nurses face risks of life-threatening infection, which can create psychological distress. Quality of care for infected patients depends on mental well-being of nurses which calls for research on predictors of stress among health care workers. Responding to a call for research on the effects of leadership styles on psychological distress during traumatic events, this paper uses the theoretical lens of social exchange theory and contributes to literature on relationships between inclusive leadership, psychological distress, work engagement, and self-sacrifice. Participants of this cross sectional study included 497 registered nurses from five hospitals in Wuhan. Data were collected with temporal separation through an online questionnaire. Partial least-squares structural equation modeling was used to analyze data. Results show inclusive leadership has a significant negative relationship with psychological distress. Work engagement mediates this relationship, and nurses’ self-sacrificial behavior moderates it. Findings indicate inclusive leadership style serves as a sustainable mechanism to reduce psychological distress during pandemics. It can operationalize the delivery of mental health support in real-time in work settings. Results provide empirical support for social exchange theory through high work engagement to help control psychological distress among nurses.","Ahmed, Fawad; Zhao, Fuqiang; Faraz, Naveed Ahmad",Front Psychol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32849111/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2020.01898,625

Methods: DALYs were estimated using an incidence-based and pathogen-based approach. Incidence was estimated through assessment of data availability and quality, and a correction was applied for under-estimation. Calculation of DALYs was performed with the BCoDE software toolkit without applying time discounting and age-weighting. Results: We estimated that one in 14 inhabitants experienced an infectious disease episode for a total burden of 1.38 million DALYs (95% uncertainty interval (UI): 1.25–1.5) between 2009 and 2013; 76% of which was related to the acute phase of the infection and its short-term complications. Influenza had the highest burden (30% of the total burden), followed by tuberculosis, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection/AIDS and invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD). Men had the highest burden measured in DALYs (60% of the total), adults 65 years of age and over had 24% and children less than 5 years of age had 11%. Age group-specific burden showed that infants (less than 1 year of age) and elderly people (80 years of age and over) experienced the highest burden.

We applied class comparisons, modular analysis, and class prediction algorithms to identify and validate diagnostic biosignatures for bacterial and viral LRTI. Results. Patients were classified as having bacterial (n = 22), viral (n = 71), or bacterial-viral LRTI (n = 25) based on comprehensive microbiologic testing. Compared with healthy controls, statistical group comparisons (P < .01; multiple-test corrections) identified 3376 differentially expressed genes in patients with bacterial LRTI, 2391 in viral LRTI, and 2628 in bacterial-viral LRTI. Patients with bacterial LRTI showed significant overexpression of inflammation and neutrophil genes (bacterial > bacterial-viral > viral), and those with viral LRTI displayed significantly greater overexpression of interferon genes (viral > bacterial-viral > bacterial). The K–nearest neighbors algorithm identified 10 classifier genes that discriminated between bacterial and viral LRTI with a 95% sensitivity (95% confidence interval, 77%–100%) and 92% specificity (77%–98%), compared with a sensitivity of 38% (18%–62%) and a specificity of 91% (76%–98%) for procalcitonin. Conclusions. Transcriptional profiling is a helpful tool for diagnosis of LRTI.","Suarez, Nicolas M.; Bunsow, Eleonora; Falsey, Ann R.; Walsh, Edward E.; Mejias, Asuncion; Ramilo, Octavio",Journal of Infectious Diseases,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25637350/; https://academic.oup.com/jid/article-pdf/212/2/213/13806449/jiv047.pdf; https://doi.org/10.1093/infdis/jiv047,625

University professors suddenly shifted to work from home adopting distance teaching. OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to investigate Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQoL) and its associated occupational and health factors during COVID-19 among university professors. METHODS: A cross-sectional design targeted university professors of all majors in Jordan. The study self-administered survey included demographics and lifestyle data, 12-item Short Form health survey (SF-12), Depression Anxiety Stress Scale (DASS 21), professor' evaluation of distance teaching, Neck Disability Index (NDI), and International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ). Descriptive analyses were conducted to demonstrate primary outcome measures data. Factors associated with HRQoL were determined using a multiple variable linear regression analysis. RESULTS: A total of 299 university professors successfully completed the study. Participants' SF-12 physical health component score was 74.08 (±18.5) and 65.74 (±21.4) for mental health component. Higher depression, stress, neck disability, and weight change were significantly associated with lower HRQoL level. While higher satisfaction with distance teaching, health self-evaluation, and work load change were significantly associated with higher HRQoL level. The regression model explained 66.7%of the variance in professors' HRQoL (r2â=â0.667, Fâ=â82.83, Pâ<â0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Jordanian university professors demonstrated good HRQoL and mental health levels during COVID-19 lockdown. Factors associated with professors' HRQoL should be considered by academic institutions in determining the best occupational setup of teaching activities in future pandemics.","Almhdawi, Khader A; Obeidat, Donia; Kanaan, Saddam F; Hajela, Nupur; Bsoul, Mohammad; Arabiat, Alaa; Alazrai, Alza; Jaber, Hanan; Alrabbaie, Hassan",Work,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34420997/; https://doi.org/10.3233/wor-205276,625

We present a method for determining the posterior probability distribution of IBD segment endpoints. Our approach accounts for genotype errors, recent mutations, and gene conversions which disrupt DNA sequence identity within IBD segments, and it can be applied to large cohorts with whole-genome sequence or SNP array data. We find that our method’s estimates of uncertainty are well calibrated for homogeneous samples. We quantify endpoint uncertainty for 77.7 billion IBD segments from 408,883 individuals of white British ancestry in the UK Biobank, and we use these IBD segments to find regions showing evidence of recent natural selection. We show that many spurious selection signals are eliminated by the use of unbiased estimates of IBD segment endpoints and a pedigree-based genetic map. Eleven of the twelve regions with the greatest evidence for recent selection in our scan have been identified as selected in previous analyses using different approaches. Our computationally efficient method for quantifying IBD segment endpoint uncertainty is implemented in the open source ibd-ends software package.","Browning, Sharon R.; Browning, Brian L.",Am J Hum Genet,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0002929720303554; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33053335/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajhg.2020.09.010; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0002929720303554,625
659956,The Impact of Financial and Psychological Wellbeing on Children’s Physical Activity and Screen-Based Activities during the COVID-19 Pandemic,2021-08-17,"BACKGROUND: The recent rise in the incidence of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infections in a densely populated city of eastern India (“mixing vessel” of people of varied socio-economic and immune status) prompted this study. Applying saliva on fingers for enumerating bank notes is a common practice in the Indian subcontinent. Paper notes may be a potential source of “horizontal” transmission of this virus, especially if there are cuts/bruises on the oral mucous membrane or skin. AIM: To investigate whether paper currencies could be a plausible mode of horizontal transmission of HBV infection. METHODS: Polymerase chain reactions (PCR) followed by nucleotide sequencing was done for the detection of HBV. Hepatitis B virus surface antigen enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay(HBsAg ELISA) was performed on all HBV deoxyribonucleic acid-positive samples to check the detectability of the virus. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) was carried out for visual confirmation of HBV particles in ultracentrifuged/immunoprecipitated samples from currency paper washings. RESULTS: HBV-specific PCRs on pellets obtained after ultracentrifugation/ immunoprecipitation of the currency paper washings detected potentially intact/viable HBV (genotype D2) in 7.14% of samples (n = 70). AFM gave the visual confirmation of HBV particles in ultracentrifuged/immunoprecipitated samples from currency paper washings. However, HBV isolates from the currency notes could not be detected by HBsAg ELISA. CONCLUSION: It is a common practice in the Indian subcontinent to count paper currencies by applying saliva on fingertips. Paper notes may be a potential source of “horizontal” transmission of this virus, especially if there are cuts/bruises on the oral mucous membrane or skin, but it was practically not possible to demonstrate experimentally such transmission. Detection of potentially intact/viable and “occult” HBV from currency poses potential risk of silent transmission of this virus among the general population.","Das, Palashpriya; Supekar, Ruchi; Chatterjee, Ritika; Roy, Subrata; Ghosh, Anisa; Biswas, Subhajit",World J Hepatol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33200016/; https://doi.org/10.4254/wjh.v12.i10.775,625

TCM, as a bodyguard, has saved countless lives and maintained human health in the long history, especially in this COVID-19 pandemic. Pains of diseases have been removed from the effective TCM therapy, such as TCM preparation, moxibustion, and acupuncture. With the development of life science and technology, the wisdom and foresight of TCM has been more displayed. Furthermore, TCM has been also inherited and developed in innovation to better realize the modernization and globalization. Nowadays, intestinal flora transforming TCM and TCM targeted intestinal flora treating diseases have been important findings in life science. More and more TCM researches showed the significance of intestinal flora. Intestinal flora is also a way to study TCM to elucidate the profound theory of TCM. Processing, compatibility, and properties of TCM are well demonstrated by intestinal flora. Thus, it is no doubt that intestinal flora is a core in TCM study. The interaction between intestinal flora and TCM is so crucial for host health. Therefore, it is necessary to sum up the latest results in time. This paper systematically depicted the profile of TCM and the importance of intestinal flora in host.

660476,Physical Activity in Adolescents with and without Type 1 Diabetes during the New Zealand COVID-19 Pandemic Lockdown of 2020,2021-04-23,"OBJECTIVE: The relationship between 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 (25(OH)D), the surrogate marker for vitamin D(3), serum concentration and COVID-19 has come to the forefront as a potential pathway to improve COVID-19 outcomes. The current evidence remains unclear on the impact of vitamin D status on the severity and outcomes of COVID-19 infection. To explore possible association between low 25(OH)D levels and risk of developing severe COVID-19 (i.e. need for invasive mechanical ventilation, the length of hospital stay, total deaths). We also aimed to understand the relationship between vitamin D insufficiency and elevated inflammatory and cardiac biomarkers. METHODS: We conducted a comprehensive electronic literature search for any original research study published up to March 30, 2021. For the purpose of this review, low vitamin D status was defined as a range of serum total 25(OH)D levels of <10 to <30 ng/ml. Two independent investigators assessed study eligibility, synthesized evidence, analyzed, critically examined, and interpreted herein. RESULTS: Twenty-four observational studies containing 3637 participants were included in the meta-analysis. The mean age of the patients was 61.1 years old; 56% were male. Low vitamin D status was statistically associated with higher risk of death (RR, 1.60 (95% CI, 1.10–2.32), higher risk of developing severe COVID-19 pneumonia (RR: 1.50; 95% CI, 1.10–2.05). COVID-19 patients with low vitamin D levels had a greater prevalence of hypertension and cardiovascular diseases, abnormally high serum troponin and peak D-dimer levels, as well as elevated interleukin-6 and C-reactive protein than those with serum 25(OH)D levels ≥30 ng/ml. CONCLUSIONS: In this meta-analysis, we found a potential increased risk of developing severe COVID-19 infection among patients with low vitamin D levels. There are plausible biological mechanisms supporting the role of vitamin D in COVID-19 severity. Randomized controlled trials are needed to test for potential beneficial effects of vitamin D in COVID-19 outcomes.","Ben-Eltriki, Mohamed; Hopefl, Robert; Wright, James M.; Deb, Subrata",J Am Coll Nutr,https://doi.org/10.1080/07315724.2021.1951891; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34464543/,625

Therefore, we developed an in vitro airway epithelial–endothelial cell culture model based on Calu-3 human lung epithelial cells and human lung microvascular endothelial cells (LMVECs), cultured on opposite sides of flexible porous poly(trimethylene carbonate) (PTMC) membranes. Calu-3 cells, cultured for two weeks at an air–liquid interface (ALI), showed good expression of the tight junction (TJ) protein Zonula Occludens 1 (ZO-1). LMVECs cultured submerged for three weeks were CD31-positive, but the expression was diffuse and not localized at the cell membrane. Barrier functions of the Calu-3 cell cultures and the co-cultures with LMVECs were good, as determined by electrical resistance measurements and fluorescein isothiocyanate-dextran (FITC-dextran) permeability assays. Importantly, the Calu-3/LMVEC co-cultures showed better cell viability and barrier function than mono-cultures. Moreover, there was no evidence for epithelial- and endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT and EndoMT, respectively) based on staining for the mesenchymal markers vimentin and α-SMA, respectively. These results indicate the potential of this new airway epithelial–endothelial model for lung research. In addition, since the PTMC membrane is flexible, the model can be expanded by introducing cyclic stretch for enabling mechanical stimulation of the cells. Furthermore, the model can form the basis for biomimetic airway epithelial–endothelial and alveolar–endothelial models with primary lung epithelial cells.","Pasman, Thijs; Baptista, Danielle; van Riet, Sander; Truckenmüller, Roman K.; Hiemstra, Pieter S.; Rottier, Robbert J.; Hamelmann, Naomi M.; Paulusse, Jos M.

Important efforts are being organized worldwide to implement sewage-based surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 that can be used for preventive or early warning purposes, informing preparedness and response measures. However, its successful implementation requires important and iterative methodological improvements, as well as the establishment of standardized methods. The aim of this study was to develop a continuous monitoring protocol for SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater, that could be used to model virus circulation within the communities, complementing the current clinical surveillance. Specific objectives included (1) optimization and validation of a sensitive method for virus quantification; (2) monitoring the time-evolution of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater from two wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) in the city of Porto, Portugal. Untreated wastewater samples were collected weekly from the two WWTPs between May 2020 and March 2021, encompassing two COVID-19 incidence peaks in the region (mid-November 2020 and mid-January 2021). In the first stage of this study, we compared, optimized and selected a sampling and analysis protocol that included RNA virus concentration through centrifugation, RNA extraction from both liquid and solid fractions and quantification by reverse transcription quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR). In the second stage, we used the selected methodology to track SARS-CoV-2 in the collected wastewater over time. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in 39 and 37 out of 48 liquid and solid fraction samples of untreated wastewater, respectively. The copy numbers varied throughout the study between 0 and 0.15 copies/ng RNA and a good fit was observed between the SARS-CoV-2 RNA concentration in the untreated wastewater and the COVID-19 temporal trends in the study region. In agreement with the recent literature, the results from this study support the use of wastewater-based surveillance to complement clinical testing and evaluate temporal and spatial trends of the current pandemic.","Tomasino, M.

The cardiac injury is a common condition among the hospitalized patients with COVID-19. However, whether N terminal pro B type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) predicted outcome of severe COVID-19 patients was unknown. METHODS: The study initially enrolled 102 patients with severe COVID-19 from a continuous sample. After screening out the ineligible cases, 54 patients were analyzed in this study. The primary outcome was in-hospital death defined as the case fatality rate. Research information and following-up data were obtained from their medical records. RESULTS: The best cut-off value of NT-proBNP for predicting in-hospital death was 88.64 pg/mL with the sensitivity for 100% and the specificity for 66.67%. Patients with high NT-proBNP values (> 88.64 pg/mL) had a significantly increased risk of death during the days of following-up compared with those with low values (≤88.64 pg/mL). After adjustment for potential risk factors, NT-proBNP was independently correlated with in-hospital death.

661687,Changes to Physical Activity during a Global Pandemic: A Mixed Methods Analysis among a Diverse Population-Based Sample of Emerging Adults in the U.S.,2021-04-01,"Seroepidemiologic and virologic studies since 1889 suggested that human influenza pandemics were caused by H1, H2, and H3 subtypes of influenza A viruses. If not for the 1997 avian A/H5N1 outbreak in Hong Kong of China, subtype H2 is the likely candidate for the next pandemic. However, unlike previous poultry outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian influenza due to H5 that were controlled by depopulation with or without vaccination, the presently circulating A/H5N1 genotype Z virus has since been spreading from Southern China to other parts of the world. Migratory birds and, less likely, bird trafficking are believed to be globalizing the avian influenza A/H5N1 epidemic in poultry. More than 200 human cases of avian influenza virus infection due to A/H5, A/H7, and A/H9 subtypes mainly as a result of poultry-to-human transmission have been reported with a > 50% case fatality rate for A/H5N1 infections. A mutant or reassortant virus capable of efficient human-to-human transmission could trigger another influenza pandemic. The recent isolation of this virus in extrapulmonary sites of human diseases suggests that the high fatality of this infection may be more than just the result of a cytokine storm triggered by the pulmonary disease. The emergence of resistance to adamantanes (amantadine and rimantadine) and recently oseltamivir while H5N1 vaccines are still at the developmental stage of phase I clinical trial are causes for grave concern. Moreover, the to-be pandemic strain may have little cross immunogenicity to the presently tested vaccine strain. The relative importance and usefulness of airborne, droplet, or contact precautions in infection control are still uncertain. Laboratory-acquired avian influenza H7N7 has been reported, and the laboratory strains of human influenza H2N2 could also be the cause of another pandemic. The control of this impending disaster requires more research in addition to national and international preparedness at various levels. The epidemiology, virology, clinical features, laboratory diagnosis, management, and hospital infection control measures are reviewed from a clinical perspective.","Wong, Samson S.Y.; Yuen, Kwok-yung",Chest,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0012369215315361; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16424427/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0012369215315361,625

Priority groups include members of key populations—female sex workers (FSW), men having sex with men (MSM), and people who use drugs (PWUD)—and their partners and relatives. HIVST distribution activities, which began in mid-2019, were impacted in early 2020 by the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: This article, focusing only on outreach activities among key populations, analyzes quantitative, and qualitative program data collected during implementation to examine temporal trends in HIVST distribution and their evolution in the context of the COVID-19 health crisis. Specifically, we investigated the impact on, the adaptation of and the disruption of field activities. Results: In all three countries, the pre-COVID-19 period was marked by a gradual increase in HIVST distribution. The period corresponding to the initial emergency response (March-May 2020) witnessed an important disruption of activities: a total suspension in Senegal, a significant decline in Côte d'Ivoire, and a less pronounced decrease in Mali. Secondary distribution was also negatively impacted. Peer educators showed resilience and adapted by relocating from public to private areas, reducing group sizes, moving night activities to the daytime, increasing the use of social networks, integrating hygiene measures, and promoting assisted HIVST as an alternative to conventional rapid testing. From June 2020 onward, with the routine management of the COVID-19 pandemic, a catch-up phenomenon was observed with the resumption of activities in Senegal, the opening of new distribution sites, a rebound in the number of distributed HIVST kits, a resurgence in larger group activities, and a rebound in the average number of distributed HIVST kits per primary contact. Conclusions: Although imperfect, the program data provide useful information to describe changes in the implementation of HIVST outreach activities over time. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on HIVST distribution among key populations was visible in the monthly activity reports. Focus groups and individual interviews allowed us to document the adaptations made by peer educators, with variations across countries and populations. These adaptations demonstrate the resilience and learning capacities of peer educators and key populations.","Kra, Arsène Kouassi; Colin, Géraldine; Diop, Papa Moussa; Fotso, Arlette Simo; Rouveau, Nicolas; Hervé, Kouakou Kouamé; Geoffroy, Olivier; Diallo, Bakary; Kabemba, Odé Kanku; Dieng, Baidy; Diallo, Sanata; Vautier, Anthony; Larmarange, Joseph",Front Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34354973/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2021.653565,625

Thus, the accurate assessment of antibodies during a pandemic can provide important evidence for monitoring pathogen exposure, understanding the role of antibodies in protective immunity, and helping vaccine development. METHODS: In this study, 96 west Iranian recovered COVID-19 subjects were recruited and, based on clinical symptoms and disease severity, categorized into three different groups: mild, moderate, and severe. In addition, the presence and dynamic change of SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG antibody three, four-, and six months post symptom onset (PSO) were measured. Also, the association between IgG antibody titer with clinical symptoms and disease severity was examined. RESULTS: Although in real-time RT-PCR-positive samples negative IgG antibody results were found, most subjects mount humoral immune responses that could raise a robust SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG antibody. Furthermore, this antibody persisted in the serum of most recovered COVID-19 subjects at least six months PSO and demonstrated little to no decrease. Also, specific IgG antibody titer was strongly correlated with clinical symptoms and disease severity. CONCLUSIONS: These results provide an insight into the presence and persistence of the SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG antibody. Although serological tests could not be used as the primary diagnostic test, they may support real-time RT-PCR results. Also, they could be used for diagnosing COVID-19 subjects tested later outside of the optimal period.

Notably, only 7% of malaria cases were indigenous and the other cases were all imported. The number of malaria cases increased from 2005 to 2007, peaked in 2007, and then decreased from 2007 to 2011. There were no indigenous cases from 2012 to 2014. Of all cases, 68% of cases contracted Plasmodium vivax, 27% of cases contracted P. falciparum, and two cases contracted P. malariae. About 88% of malaria cases during 2005–2011 occurred yearly between May and October, but the number of malaria cases in different months during 2012–2014 was similar. The median age was 33 years, and 1,892 cases occurred in persons aged 20–50 years. The proportion of businessmen increased and the proportion of migrant laborers decreased in recent years. The median time from illness onset to confirmation of malaria cases was 5 days and it decreased from 2005 to 2014. Some epidemiological characteristics of malaria have changed, and businessmen are the emphases to surveillance in every month.","Chen, Hualiang; Yao, Linong; Zhang, Lingling; Zhang, Xuan; Lu, Qiaoyi; Yu, Kegen; Ruan, Wei",Am J Trop Med Hyg,https://doi.org/10.4269/ajtmh.15-0080; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26078321/,625
664145,Comparative Study of Attitudes towards Communication Skills Learning between Medical and Dental Students in Saudi Arabia,2020-12-27,"BACKGROUND: Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a novel infectious disease with global impact. A virus from the family Coronaviridae has been identified as the cause, but the pathogenesis is still unclear. METHODS: Post-mortem tissue samples from six patients who died from SARS in February and March, 2003, and an open lung biopsy from one of these patients were studied by histology and virology. Only one full autopsy was done. Evidence of infection with the SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and human metapneumovirus was sought by reverse-transcriptase PCR and serology. Pathological samples were examined by light and electron microscopy and immunohistochemistry. FINDINGS: All six patients had serological evidence of recent infection with SARS-CoV. Diffuse alveolar damage was common but not universal. Morphological changes identified were bronchial epithelial denudation, loss of cilia, and squamous metaplasia. Secondary bacterial pneumonia was present in one case. A giant-cell infiltrate was seen in four patients, with a pronounced increase in macrophages in the alveoli and the interstitium of the lung. Haemophagocytosis was present in two patients. The alveolar pneumocytes also showed cytomegaly with granular amphophilic cytoplasm. The patient for whom full autopsy was done had atrophy of the white pulp of the spleen. Electron microscopy revealed viral particles in the cytoplasm of epithelial cells corresponding to coronavirus. INTERPRETATION: SARS is associated with epithelial-cell proliferation and an increase in macrophages in the lung. The presence of haemophagocytosis supports the contention that cytokine dysregulation may account, at least partly, for the severity of the clinical disease. The case definition of SARS should acknowledge the range of lung pathology associated with this disease.

Methods An observational ICU cohort study including adult patients admitted to the ICU at Uppsala University Hospital, Uppsala, Sweden, from March 13th to June 8th 2020. We compared the clinical, electrophysiological and plasma biomarker data between COVID-19 patients who developed CIN/CIM and those who did not. Electrophysiological characteristics were also compared between COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 ICU patients. Results 111 COVID-19 patients were included, 11 of whom developed CIN/CIM. Patients with CIN/CIM had more severe illness; longer ICU stay, more thromboembolic events and were more frequently treated with invasive ventilation for longer than 2 weeks. In particular CIN was more frequent among COVID-19 patients with ICUAW (50%) compared with a non-COVID-19 cohort (0%, p=0.008). Neurofilament light chain (NfL) and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAp) levels were higher in the CIN/CIM group compared with those that did not develop CIN/CIM (both p=0.001) and correlated with nerve amplitudes. Conclusions CIN/CIM was more prevalent among COVID-19 ICU patients with severe illness. Significance COVID-19 patients who later developed CIN/CIM had significantly higher NfL and GFAp in the early phase of ICU care, suggesting their potential as predictive biomarkers for CIN/CIM.","Frithiof, Robert; Rostami, Elham; Kumlien, Eva; Virhammar, Johan; Fällmar, David; Hultström, Michael; Lipcsey, Miklós; Ashton, Nicholas; Blennow, Kaj; Zetterberg, Henrik; Rostedt Punga, Anna",Clin Neurophysiol,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1388245721004892?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33875374/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.clinph.2021.03.016; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1388245721004892,625
665853,Risk Perception of Air Pollution: A Systematic Review Focused on Particulate Matter Exposure,2020-09-03,"Almost every dataset these days continually faces the predicament of class imbalance. It is difficult to train classifiers on these types of data as they become biased towards a set of classes, hence leading to reduction in classifier performance. This setback is often tackled by the use of various over-sampling or under-sampling algorithms. But, the method which stood out of all the numerous algorithms was the Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE). SMOTE generates synthetic samples of the minority class by oversampling each data-point by considering linear combinations of existing minority class neighbors. Each minority data sample generates an equal number of synthetic data. As the world is suffering from the plight of COVID-19 pandemic, the authors applied the idea to help boost the classifying performance whilst detecting this deadly virus. This paper presents a modified version of SMOTE known as Outlier-SMOTE wherein each data-point is oversampled with respect to its distance from other data-points. The data-point which is farther than the other data-points is given more importance and is oversampled more than the others. Outlier-SMOTE reduces the chances of overlapping of minority data samples which often occurs in the traditional SMOTE algorithm. This method is tested on five benchmark datasets and are eventually tested on a COVID-19 dataset. F-measure, Recall and Precision are used as principle metrics to evaluate the performance of the classifier as is the case for any class imbalanced data set. The proposed algorithm performs considerably better than the traditional SMOTE algorithm for the considered datasets.","Kumar Turlapati, Venkata Pavan; Prusty, Manas Ranjan",Intell Based Med,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ibmed.2020.100023; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33289013/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2666521220300235; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666521220300235?v=s5,625

A Scoping Review,2021-01-05,"OBJECTIVES: To evaluate effectiveness of a nasal resveratrol/carboxymethyl-β-glucan solution compared to nasal saline solution: a) on common cold symptoms by means of a validated measure scale (CARIFS score), b) on Rhinovirus infection and CCL2, CCL5, IL8, IL6, CXCL10 and TLR2 expression in nasal swabs, c) on frequency of relapses after 30 days of follow-up. METHODS: 89 infants with respiratory infection symptoms were randomly assigned to receive either a nasal resveratrol/carboxymethyl-β-glucan solution or nasal saline solution. All patients were evaluated with CARIFS score at enrollment, after 48 h, 7 and 30 days by physicians and parents. Nasal swabs were obtained at enrollment, after 48 h and after one week. RESULTS: CARIFS score improved in both groups. Episodes of sneezing and cough were fewer in study group after 7 days of follow-up (p < 0.05). No significant differences were found on nasopharyngeal swabs in Rhinovirus detection and cytokines expression after 48 h, nor in 30 days relapses. TLR2 expression was significantly higher in Rhinovirus infected children of the study group. No adverse effects occurred. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that a solution containing resveratrol plus carboxymethyl-β-glucan might have a positive impact on both clinical and socio-economic burden due to infant common cold.","Baldassarre, Maria Elisabetta; Di Mauro, Antonio; Labellarte, Grazia; Pignatelli, Mariacristina; Fanelli, Margherita; Schiavi, Elisa; Mastromarino, Paola; Capozza, Manuela; Panza, Raffaella; Laforgia, Nicola",Heliyon,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2020.e03814; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32322697/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2405844020306599; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2405844020306599,625

In this study, IgG antibodies specific for the virus were evaluated in individuals working at one university in Bogota-Colombia. The aim of this work was to determine previous exposure to SARS-CoV-2 in those attending the campus during city lockdown. A total of 237 individuals including 93 women and 144 men were evaluated using chemiluminescent detection of IgG anti N-viral protein. There were 32 positives giving a seroprevalence of 13.5% (10 women and 22 men) and mostly asymptomatic (68.75%). Only 13 of the seropositive individuals had previous positive detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA by RT-qPCR done in average 91 days before serological test. Seropositive individuals did not come from localities having higher percentages of SARS-CoV-2 cases in the city. Three cluster of seropositive individuals were identified. This survey was carried out after the first peak of SARS-CoV-2 transmission in the city, and before the preparedness to reopening the campus for students in 2021.

669361,"Regional Variability in COVID-19 Case Fatality Rate in Canada, February–December 2020",2021-02-14,"The severe acute respiratory distress syndrome-associated coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), the etiologic agent of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), is a single-stranded RNA virus whose sequence is known. COVID-19 is associated with a heterogeneous clinical phenotype ranging from asymptomatic to fatal disease. It appears that access to nasopharyngeal respiratory epithelia expressing angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) 2, the receptor for SARS CoV-2, is followed by viral replication in the pulmonary alveolar septal capillary bed. We have shown in prior studies that incomplete viral particles, termed pseudovirions, dock to deep subcutaneous and other vascular beds potentially contributing to the prothrombotic state and systemic complement activation that characterizes severe and critical COVID-19. A variety of skin rashes have been described in the setting of SARS-CoV-2 infection and more recently, following COVID-19 vaccination. The vaccines deliver a laboratory synthesized mRNA that encodes a protein that is identical to the spike glycoprotein of SARS-COV-2 allowing the production of immunogenic spike glycoprotein that will then elicit T cell and B cell adaptive immune responses. In this paper we review an array of cutaneous manifestations of COVID-19 that provide an opportunity to study critical pathophysiologic mechanisms that underlie all clinical facets of COVID-19 ranging from asymptomatic/mild to severe and critical COVID-19. We classify cutaneous COVID-19 according to underlying pathophysiologic principles. In this regard we propose two main pathways: 1) complement mediated thrombotic vascular injury syndromes deploying the alternative and mannan binding lectin pathways in the setting of severe and critical COVID-19 and 2) the robust T cell and type I interferon driven inflammatory and humoral driven immune complex mediated vasculitic cutaneous reactions seen with mild and moderate COVID-19. Novel data on cutaneous vaccine reactions are presented that manifest a clinical and morphologic parallel with similar eruptions seen in patients suffering from mild and moderate COVID-19 and in most cases represent systemic eczematoid hypersensitivity reactions to a putative vaccine based antigen. Finally, we show for the first time the localization of human synthesized spike glycoprotein following the COVID-19 vaccine to the cutaneous and subcutaneous vasculature confirming the ability of SARS CoV-2 spike glycoprotein to bind endothelium in the absence of intact virus.","Magro, Cynthia; Nuovo, Gerard; Mulvey, Justin; Laurence, Jeffrey; Harp, Joanna; Neil Crowson, A.",Clin Dermatol,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.clindermatol.2021.07.001; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0738081X21001310; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0738081X21001310?v=s5,625
669627,"Waterpipe Use among Adolescents in Germany: Prevalence, Associated Consumer Characteristics, and Trends (German Health Interview and Examination Survey for Children and Adolescents, KiGGS)",2020-10-22,"Abstract The mRNA synthesis of mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) has been proposed to be the result of interaction between the leader RNA and the intergenic sites. Previously, we have identified a transcription initiation site (for mRNA 2-1), which is more efficiently transcribed by viruses containing two copies of UCUAA sequence in the leader RNA than by those with three copies. In this study, we have identified several sites which are regulated in the opposite way, namely, they are efficiently transcribed by the leader RNA with three UCUAA copies but not by those with two copies. These sites were characterized by primer extension and amplification by polymerase chain reaction. One of these sites is in the gene 3 region of a recombinant virus between A59 and JHM strains of MHV. Another is in the gene 2 region of MHV-1 strain. Both of these sites have a sequence similar to but different from the consensus transcription initiation signal (UCUAAUCUAUC and UUUAAUCUU, as opposed to UCUAAAC). These two novel intergenic sequences are not present in the genome of the JHM strain, consistent with the absence of these mRNAs in the JHM-infected cells. The discovery of this type of transcription initiation site provides additional evidence for the importance of the leader RNA in the transcription initiation of MHV mRNAs.","La Monica, Nicola; Yokomori, Kyoko; Lai, Michael M.C.",Virology,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/004268229290774J; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/004268229290774J; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1566582/,625
670077,Neurological Complications of COVID-19 and Possible Neuroinvasion Pathways: A Systematic Review,2020-09-14,"Influenza A virus (IAV), similar to other viruses, exploits the machinery of human host cells for its survival and replication. We identified α‐actinin‐4, a host cytoskeletal protein, as an interacting partner of IAV nucleoprotein (NP). We confirmed this interaction using co‐immunoprecipitation studies, first in a coupled in vitro transcription‐translation assay and then in cells either transiently co‐expressing the two proteins or infected with whole IAV. Importantly, the NP–actinin‐4 interaction was observed in several IAV subtypes, including the 2009 H1N1 pandemic virus. Moreover, immunofluorescence studies revealed that both NP and actinin‐4 co‐localized largely around the nucleus and also in the cytoplasmic region of virus‐infected A549 cells. Silencing of actinin‐4 expression resulted in not only a significant decrease in NP, M2 and NS1 viral protein expression, but also a reduction of both NP mRNA and viral RNA levels, as well as viral titers, 24 h post‐infection with IAV, suggesting that actinin‐4 was critical for viral replication. Furthermore, actinin‐4 depletion reduced the amount of NP localized in the nucleus. Treatment of infected cells with wortmannin, a known inhibitor of actinin‐4, led to a decrease in NP mRNA levels and also caused the nuclear retention of NP, further strengthening our previous observations. Taken together, the results of the present study indicate that actinin‐4, a novel interacting partner of IAV NP, plays a crucial role in viral replication and this interaction may participate in nuclear localization of NP and/or viral ribonucleoproteins.

More than 80% of URTIs are viral. Etiological diagnosis of URTIs is important to make correct clinical decisions on treatment methods. However, data for viral spectrum of URTIs are very limited in Shanghai children. METHODS: Nasopharyngeal swabs were collected from a group of 164 children aged below 3 years who were hospitalized due to acute respiratory infection from May 2009 to July 2010 in Shanghai. A VRDAL multiplex PCR for 10 common respiratory viruses was performed on collected specimens compared with the Seeplex® RV15 ACE Detection kit for 15 respiratory viruses. RESULTS: Viruses were detected in 84 (51.2%) patients by VRDAL multiplex PCR, and 8 (4.9%) of cases were mixed infections. Using the Seeplex® RV15 ACE Detection kit, viruses were detected in 129 (78.7%) patients, 49 (29.9%) were co-infected cases. Identified viruses included 37 of human rhinovirus (22.6% of cases), 32 of influenza A virus (19.5%), 30 of parainfluenzavirus-2 (18.3%), 23 of parainfluenzavirus-3 (14.0%), 15 of human enterovirus (9.1%), 14 each of parainfluenzavirus-1, respiratory syncytial virus B and adenovirus (8.5%), 8 of coronavirus 229E/NL63 (4.9%), 6 of human bocavirus (3.7%), 5 each of influenza B virus and respiratory syncytial virus A (3.0%), 3 of parainfluenzavirus-4 (1.8%), 2 of coronavirus OC43/HKU1 (1.2%), and 1 human metapneumovirus (0.6%).

The development of vaccines and medicines is costly and time consuming. Thus, the development of novel materials and technologies to decrease viral availability, viability, infectivity, and to improve therapeutic outcomes can positively impact the prevention and treatment of viral diseases. METHODS: Herein, we discuss (a) interaction mechanisms between viruses and materials, (b) novel strategies to develop materials with antiviral properties and oral antiviral delivery systems, and (c) the potential of artificial intelligence to design and optimize preventive measures and therapeutic regimen. RESULTS: The mechanisms of viral adsorption on surfaces are well characterized but no major breakthrough has become clinically available. Materials with fine-tuned physical and chemical properties have the potential to compromise viral availability and stability. Emerging strategies using oral antiviral delivery systems and artificial intelligence can decrease infectivity and improve antiviral therapies. SIGNIFICANCE: Emerging viral infections are concerning due to risk of mortality, as well as psychological and economic impacts.

672952,How Have Public Safety Personnel Seeking Digital Mental Healthcare Been Affected by the COVID-19 Pandemic? An Exploratory Mixed Methods Study,2020-12-13,"As a consequence of the Spring 2020 lockdown that occurred in Spain due to the COVID-19 pandemic, many people lost their jobs or had to be furloughed. The objective of this study is to analyse the influence of the latter changes in labour market status on psychological well-being. For this purpose, an ad-hoc questionnaire featuring socio-demographic and mental health criteria was created. Granted that the pandemic can be viewed as an exogenous shock, the bias caused by the bidirectional problems between the work situation and mental well-being can be tackled. Results indicate that the lockdown exerted a greater negative effect on the self-perceived well-being of unemployed and furloughed persons than on those in employment. Moreover, among those in continuous employment, teleworkers experienced a lesser degree of self-perceived well-being post lockdown as compared to those people remaining in the same work location throughout the COVID-19 crisis. Finally, the lockdown provoked worse effects on the self-perceived well-being of women as compared to men, a result that appears to be related to gender differences in household production. In conclusion, these results could be especially relevant given that the evolution of the pandemic is having ongoing effects on employment and, therefore, on the mental health of workers.","Escudero-Castillo, Israel; Mato-Díaz, Fco.

We report the characteristics of patients with severe or critical severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection in Wuhan city, China, and the risk factors related to infection severity and death. METHODS: We extracted the demographic and clinical data of 7283 patients with severe COVID-19 infection from designated Wuhan hospitals as of 25 February 2020. Factors associated with COVID-19 critical illness and mortality were analysed using logistic- and Cox-regression analyses. RESULTS: We studied 6269 patients with severe COVID-19 illness and 1014 critically ill patients. The median (IQR) age was 64 (53–71) years; 51.2% were male, 38.9% were retirees and 7.4% had self-reported histories of chronic disease. Up to the end of the study, 1180 patients (16.2%) recovered and were discharged, 649 (8.9%) died and the remainder were still receiving treatment. The number of daily confirmed critical cases peaked between 23 January and 1 February 2020. Patients with advanced age [odds ratio (OR), 1.03; 95% confidence intervals (CIs), 1.03–1.04], male sex (OR, 1.57; 95% CI, 1.33–1.86) and pre-existing diabetes (OR, 2.11), hypertension (OR, 2.72), cardiovascular disease (OR, 2.15) or respiratory disease (OR, 3.50) were more likely to be critically ill. Compared with those who recovered and were discharged, patients who died were older [hazard ratio (HR), 1.04; 95% CI, 1.03–1.05], more likely to be male (HR, 1.74; 95% CI, 1.44–2.11) and more likely to have hypertension (HR, 5.58), cardiovascular disease (HR, 1.83) or diabetes (HR, 1.67). CONCLUSION: Advanced age, male sex and a history of chronic disease were associated with COVID-19 critical illness and death. Identifying these risk factors could help in the clinical monitoring of susceptible populations.","Wang, Fang; Cao, Jinhong; Yu, Yong; Ding, Jianbo; Eshak, Ehab S; Liu, Keyang; Mubarik, Sumaira; Shi, Fang; Wen, Haoyu; Zeng, Zixin; Bai, Jianjun; Yu, Chuanhua",Int J Epidemiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33150437/; https://doi.org/10.1093/ije/dyaa180,625

Little is known of their travel health seeking behaviours. China is the biggest source of international students studying in Australia and the unprecedented epidemic of COVID-19 in China makes this an important area of research. METHODS: Focus groups of Chinese international students were conducted to explore travel health-related knowledge, attitudes and practices. Eligible participants were studying in Sydney, and had travelled to China and Hong Kong to visit friends and relatives in the preceding 18 months. A variety of topics were explored, using a focus group guide. Thematic analysis was undertaken on the transcripts using nVivo software. The list of codes and themes were not pre-determined but developed through content analysis. RESULTS: Two focus groups were held with a total of 28 participants. Risk perception about VFR travel was generally low among Chinese international students. Pre-travel healthcare was not sought. Students strongly relied on the Internet, social media, parents and friends in China for travel health advice. CONCLUSION: This research provides insights into Chinese international students as VFR travellers. It confirms students could be a risk population for importations of infections such as COVID-19 because of low risk perception and lack of seeking travel health advice. This can inform health promotion strategies for students.","Ma, Tara; Heywood, Anita; MacIntyre, C.

The country has 27 federative units, with wide regional differences related to climate, lifestyle habits, socioeconomic characteristics and population density. Therefore, we aimed to document and monitor the increase in COVID 19 cases across each federative unit in Brazil, by tracking its progression from inception to 15 May 2020. Methods: Observational study. Results: The first confirmed COVID 19 case in the country was notified in Sao Paulo on 26 February, while the first death occurred on 17 March, in Rio de Janeiro. Since then, there has been a dramatic increase in both confirmed cases and deaths from the disease. Sao Paulo, in the Southeast region, was initially considered the COVID 19 epidemic epicentre in Brazil. However, 10 states in the North and Northeast regions were ranked among the 14 highest incidences (over 100 cases per 100,000 people) observed on 15 May. Higher incidence rates (>100 cases per 100,000) were associated to higher rates of inadequate water supply and sewerage (OR, 5.83 (95% CI, 1.08 to 29.37, P=0.041)). North and Northeast states with the highest social vulnerability index scores had higher increases in the incidence rate between 14 April and 15 May. States with medium human development index (HDI) showed higher incidence increases from 14 April to 15 May, being seven of them with ratios in the range from 27.49 to 63.73 times. Conclusion: Spreading of COVID 19 in Brazil differs across both regions and federative units, being influenced by different socioeconomic contexts.","Guerra-Shinohara, Elvira Maria; Weber, Simone Schneider; Paniz, Clovis; Gomes, Guilherme Wataru; Shinohara, Eduardo Jun; Gandra, Tiago Borges Ribeiro; Pereira, Indiara Correia; Jarcem, Karine Gomes; Zanre, Renato Ferreira de Almeida; Barreto, Acacia Gimenez; Carli, Alessandro Diogo De",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.06.02.20120220v1?rss=1; https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.06.02.20120220,625

This paper presents a holistic/Human Factors (HF) approach, where the individual, organisational and technological factors are investigated in pilot healthcare organisations to show how HF vulnerabilities may impact on cybersecurity risks. An overview of current challenges in relation to cybersecurity is first provided, followed by the presentation of an integrated top–down and bottom–up methodology using qualitative and quantitative research methods to assess the level of maturity of the pilot organisations with respect to their capability to face and tackle cyber threats and attacks. This approach adopts a user-centred perspective, involving both the organisations’ management and employees, The results show that a better cyber-security culture does not always correspond with more rule compliant behaviour. In addition, conflicts among cybersecurity rules and procedures may trigger human vulnerabilities. In conclusion, the integration of traditional technical solutions with guidelines to enhance CIS systems by leveraging HF in cybersecurity may lead to the adoption of non-technical countermeasures (such as user awareness) for a comprehensive and holistic way to manage cyber security in organisations.","Pollini, Alessandro; Callari, Tiziana C.; Tedeschi, Alessandra; Ruscio, Daniele; Save, Luca; Chiarugi, Franco; Guerri, Davide",Cogn Technol Work,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34149309/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s10111-021-00683-y,625

For confirmation, the RNA was subjected to RT-PCR targeting partial part of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and nucleocapsid, followed by amplification of complete N gene region. Nucleotide sequencing of the first Malaysian case of MERS-CoV was performed following the confirmation with real-time RT-PCR detection. Results Initial analysis of partial RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and N gene revealed that the nucleotides had high similarity to Jeddah_1_2013 strain. Analysis of complete N gene region (1 242 nucleotides) from the case showed high similarity and yet distinct to the nucleotide sequences of camel-derived MERS-CoV.

678131,Caring for Mothers: A Narrative Review on Interpersonal Violence and Peripartum Mental Health,2021-05-16,"In many biological systems, proteins interact with other organic molecules to produce indispensable functions, in which molecular recognition phenomena are essential. Proteins have kept or gained their functions during molecular evolution. Their functions seem to be flexible, and a few amino acid substitutions sometimes cause drastic changes in function. In order to monitor and predict such drastic changes in the early stages in target populations, we need to identify patterns of structural changes during molecular evolution causing decreases or increases in the binding affinity of protein complexes. In previous work, we developed a likelihood-based index to quantify the degree to which a sequence fits a given structure. This index was named the sequence-structure fitness (SSF) and is calculated empirically based on amino acid preferences and pairwise interactions in the structural environment present in template structures. In the present work, we used the SSF to develop an index to measure the binding affinity of protein–protein complexes defined as the log likelihood ratio, contrasting the fitness of the sequences to the structure of the complex and that of the uncomplexed proteins. We applied the developed index to the complexes formed between influenza A hemagglutinin (HA) and four antibodies. The antibody–antigen binding region of HA is under strong selection pressure by the host immune system. Hence, examination of the long-term adaptation of HA to the four antibodies could reveal the strategy of the molecular evolution of HA. Two antibodies cover the HA receptor-binding region, while the other two bind away from the receptor-binding region. By focusing on branches with a significant decline in binding ability, we could detect key amino acid replacements and investigate the mechanism via conditional probabilities. The contrast between the adaptations to the two types of antibodies suggests that the virus adapts to the immune system at the cost of structural change.","Watabe, Teruaki; Kishino, Hirohisa; de Oliveira Martins, Leonardo; Kitazoe, Yasuhiro",Mol Biol Evol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17478433/,625

However, little is known about the relation between specific HIV-related factors and the severity of the COVID-19 disease. METHODS: We performed a retrospective analysis of cases collected through an on-line survey distributed by the Euroguidelines in Central and Eastern Europe Network Group. In statistical analyses characteristics of HIV-positive patients, asymptomatic/moderate and moderate/severe course were compared. RESULTS: In total 34 HIV-positive patients diagnosed with COVID-19 were reported by 12 countries (Estonia, Czech Republic, Lithuania, Albania, Belarus, Romania, Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Poland, Russia, Hungary, Bulgaria). Asymptomatic courses of COVID-19 were reported in four (12%) cases, 11 (32%) patients presented with mild disease not requiring hospitalization, moderate disease with respiratory and/or systemic symptoms was observed in 14 (41%) cases, and severe disease with respiratory failure was found in five (15%) patients. The HIV-related characteristics of patients with an asymptomatic/mild course of COVID-19 were comparable to those with a moderate/severe course of COVID-19, except for the use of non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) in cART regimen (0.0% vs. 31.6% respectively, p = 0.0239).

Indeed, the SARS-CoV-2 virus is capable of causing heart disease. This systematic review can offer a new perspective on the potential consequences of COVID-19 through an analysis of the current literature on cardiac involvement. This systematic review, conducted from March 2020 to July 2021, searched the current literature for postmortem findings in patients who were positive for SARS-CoV-2 by combining and meshing the terms “COVID-19”, “postmortem”, “autopsy”, and “heart” in titles, abstracts, and keywords. The PubMed database was searched following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Sixteen papers met the inclusion criteria (case reports and series, original research, only English-written). A total of 209 patients were found (mean age (interquartile range (IQR)), 60.17 years (IQR, 54.75–70.75 years); 122 men (58.37%, ratio of men to women of 1:0.7%)). Each patient tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Death was mainly the result of respiratory failure. The second most common cause of death was acute heart failure. Few patients specifically died of myocarditis. Variables such as pathological findings, immunohistochemical data, and previous clinical assessments were analyzed. Main cardiac pathological findings were cardiac dilatation, necrosis, lymphocytic infiltration of the myocardium, and small coronary vessel microthrombosis. Immunohistochemical analyses revealed an inflammatory state dominated by the constant presence of CD3+ and CD8+ cytotoxic lymphocytes and CD68+ macrophages. COVID-19 leads to a systemic inflammatory response and a constant prothrombotic state. The results of our systematic review suggest that SARS-CoV-2 was able to cause irreversible changes in several organs, including the heart; this is reflected by the increased cardiac risk in patients who survive COVID-19. Postmortem analysis (including autopsy, histologic, and immunohistochemical examination) is an indispensable tool to better understand pathological changes caused by emerging diseases such as COVID-19. Our results may provide more information on the involvement of the heart in COVID-19 patients.","Maiese, Aniello; Frati, Paola; Del Duca, Fabio; Santoro, Paola; Manetti, Alice Chiara; La Russa, Raffaele; Di Paolo, Marco; Turillazzi, Emanuela; Fineschi, Vittorio",Diagnostics (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34573988/; https://doi.org/10.3390/diagnostics11091647,625

Strategies are urgently needed to reduce transmission in these vulnerable populations. We aimed to evaluate the reduction in transmission in nursing homes achieved through contact-targeted interventions and testing and to evaluate the effectiveness of two types of screening tests conducted with varying frequency: 1) rapid antigen testing and 2) PCR testing. Methods: We developed an agent-based Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious(Asymptomatic/Symptomatic)-Recovered (SEIR) model to examine SARS-CoV-2 transmission in nursing homes. Residents and staff are modelled individually; residents are split into two cohorts based on COVID-19 diagnosis. In the resident cohorting intervention, recovered residents are moved back from the COVID (infected) cohort to the non-COVID (susceptible/uninfected) cohort. In the immunity-based staffing intervention, recovered staff, who we assume have protective immunity, are assigned to work in the non-COVID cohort, while susceptible staff work in the COVID cohort and are assumed to have high levels of protection from personal protective equipment. These interventions aim to reduce the fraction of people's contacts that are presumed susceptible (and therefore potentially infected) and replace them with recovered (immune) contacts. Results: The frequency and type of testing has a larger impact on the size of outbreaks than the cohorting and staffing interventions. The most effective testing strategies modeled are daily antigen testing of everyone and daily antigen testing of staff with weekly PCR testing for residents. Under all screening testing strategies, the immunity-based staffing intervention reduces the final size of the outbreak. The resident cohorting intervention reduces the final outbreak size under some, but not all, testing scenarios. Conclusions: Increasing the frequency of screening testing of all residents and staff, or even staff alone, in nursing homes has the potential to greatly reduce outbreaks in this vulnerable setting. Immunity-based staffing can further reduce spread at little or no additional cost and becomes particularly important when daily testing is not feasible.","Holmdahl, I.; Kahn, R.; Hay, J.; Buckee, C.

In addition to cytosolic DNA generated by these viral infections, the metabolic demands of flight cause DNA damage and the release of self-DNA into the cytoplasm. However, whether bats have an altered DNA sensing/defense system to balance high cytosolic DNA levels remains an open question. We demonstrate that bats have a dampened interferon response due to the replacement of the highly conserved serine residue (S358) in STING, an essential adaptor protein in multiple DNA sensing pathways. Reversing this mutation by introducing S358 restored STING functionality, resulting in interferon activation and virus inhibition. Combined with previous reports on bat-specific changes of other DNA sensors such as TLR9, IFI16, and AIM2, our findings shed light on bat adaptation to flight, their long lifespan, and their unique capacity to serve as a virus reservoir.","Xie, Jiazheng; Li, Yang; Shen, Xurui; Goh, Geraldine; Zhu, Yan; Cui, Jie; Wang, Lin-Fa; Shi, Zheng-Li; Zhou, Peng",Cell Host Microbe,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1931312818300416; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chom.2018.01.006; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1931312818300416; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29478775/,625
681724,The Lived Experiences of COVID-19 Patients in South Korea: A Qualitative Study,2021-07-12,"The innate immune system acts in the first line of host defense against pathogens. One of the mechanisms used involves the early recognition and uptake of microbes by host professional phagocytes, through pattern recognition receptors (PRRs). These PRRs bind to conserved microbial ligands expressed by pathogens and initiate both innate and adaptative immune responses. Some PRRs located on the surface of dendritic cells (DCs) and other cells seem to play an important role in human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) transmission. Dendritic cell–specific intercellular adhesion molecule–3 grabbing non-integrin, CD209 (DC-SIGN) and its homolog, DC-SIGN-related (DC-SIGNR or L-SIGN) receptors are PPRs able to bind the HIV-1 gp120 envelope protein and, because alterations in their expression patterns also occur, they might play a role in both horizontal and vertical transmission as well as in disseminating the virus within the host.

Here we evaluated the immune response specific for M. tuberculosis (Mtb) and SARS-CoV-2 using a whole-blood-based assay-platform in COVID-19 patients either with TB or latent TB infection (LTBI). METHODS: We evaluated IFN-γ level in plasma from whole-blood stimulated with Mtb antigens in the Quantiferon-Plus format or with peptides derived from SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, Wuhan-Hu-1 isolate (CD4-S). RESULTS: We consecutively enrolled 63 COVID-19, 10 TB-COVID-19 and 11 LTBI-COVID-19 patients. IFN-γ response to Mtb-antigens was significantly associated to TB status and therefore it was higher in TB-COVID-19 and LTBI-COVID-19 patients compared to COVID-19 patients (p ≤ 0.0007). Positive responses against CD4-S were found in 35/63 COVID-19 patients, 7/11 LTBI-COVID-19 and only 2/10 TB-COVID-19 patients. Interestingly, the responders in the TB-COVID-19 group were less compared to COVID-19 and LTBI-COVID-19 groups (p = 0.037 and 0.044, respectively). Moreover, TB-COVID-19 patients showed the lowest quantitative IFN-γ response to CD4-S compared to COVID-19-patients (p = 0.0336) and LTBI-COVID-19 patients (p = 0.0178). CONCLUSIONS: Our data demonstrate that COVID-19 patients either TB or LTBI have a low ability to build an immune response to SARS-CoV-2 while retaining the ability to respond to Mtb-specific antigens.","Petrone, Linda; Petruccioli, Elisa; Vanini, Valentina; Cuzzi, Gilda; Gualano, Gina; Vittozzi, Pietro; Nicastri, Emanuele; Maffongelli, Gaetano; Grifoni, Alba; Sette, Alessandro; Ippolito, Giuseppe; Migliori, Giovanni Battista; Palmieri, Fabrizio; Goletti, Delia",Int J Infect Dis,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijid.2021.02.090; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1201971221001764; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33713816/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1201971221001764?v=s5,625

COVID-19 needs daunting routes such as nano-antivirals. Hence, the role of nanotechnology is very critical in combating this nano-enemy “virus.” Although substantial resources are under ongoing attention for prevention and care, we would like to start sharing with readers our vision of the role of inhaled nanomaterials and targeting systems that can play an important role in the fight against the COVID-19. In this review, we underline the genomic structure of COVID-19, recent modes of virus transmission with measures to control the infection, pathogenesis, clinical presentation of SARS-CoV-2, and how much the virus affects the lung. Additionally, the recent therapeutic approaches for managing COVID-19 with emphasis on the value of nanomaterial-based technical approaches are discussed in this review. This review also focuses on the safe and efficient delivery of useable targeted therapies using designed nanocarriers. Moreover, the effectiveness and availability of active targeting of certain specific receptors expressed on the coronavirus surfaces via tailored ligand nanoparticles are manipulated. It was also highlighted in this review the role of inhaled medicines including antivirals and repurposed drugs for fighting the associated lung disorders and efficiency of developed vaccines. Moreover, the inhalation delivery safety techniques were also highlighted.","Abdellatif, Ahmed A.H.; Tawfeek, Hesham M.; Abdelfattah, Ahmed; El-Saber Batiha, Gaber; Hetta, Helal F.",J Drug Deliv Sci Technol,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1773224721001155?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1773224721001155; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33643448/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jddst.2021.102435,625

In this study, the genetic diversity of the RSV strains was investigated among nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPA) taken from children less than 5 years of age hospitalized with ALRTIs in Hospital Serdang, Malaysia. A total of 165 NPA samples were tested for the presence of RSV and other respiratory viruses from June until December 2009. RSV was found positive in 83 (50%) of the samples using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Further classification of 67 RSV strains showed that subgroups A and B comprised 11/67 (16.4%) and 56/67 (83.6%) of the strains, respectively. The second hypervariable region at the carboxyl-terminal of the G gene was amplified and sequenced in order to do phylogenetic study. The phylogenetic relationships of the samples were determined separately for subgroups A and B using neighbor joining (NJ), maximum parsimony (MP), and Bayesian inference (BI). Phylogenetic analysis of the 32 sequenced samples showed that all 9 RSV-A strains were clustered within NA1 genotype while the remaining 23 strains of the RSV-B subgroup could be grouped into a clade consisted of strains with 60-nucleotide duplication region. They were further classified into newly discovered BA10 and BA9 genotypes. The present finding suggests the emergence of RSV genotypes of NA1 and BA.

Repurposing the existing drugs would be a promising approach for COVID-19 management. The antidepressant drugs, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) class, have antiviral, anti-inflammatory, and anticoagulant effects, which makes them auspicious drugs for COVID 19 treatment. Therefore, this study aimed to predict the possible therapeutic activity of SSRIs against COVID-19. Firstly, molecular docking studies were performed to hypothesize the possible interaction of SSRIs to the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-COV-2) main protease. Secondly, the candidate drug was loaded in lipid polymer hybrid (LPH) nanoparticles to enhance its activity. The studied SSRIs were Fluoxetine hydrochloride (FH), Atomoxteine, Paroxetine, Nisoxteine, Repoxteine RR, and Repoxteine SS. Interestingly, FH could effectively bind with SARS-COV-2 main protease via hydrogen bond formation with low binding energy (-6.7 kcal/mol). Moreover, the optimization of FH-LPH formulation achieved 65.1±2.7% encapsulation efficiency, 10.3±0.4% loading efficiency, 98.5±3.5 nm particle size, and -10.5±0.45 mV zeta potential. Additionally, it improved cellular internalization in a time-dependent manner with good biocompatibility on Human lung fibroblast (CCD-19Lu) cells. Therefore, the study suggested the potential activity of FH-LPH nanoparticles against the COVID-19 pandemic.","Elsayed Khate, Shaymaa; El-khouly, Ahmed; Mohamed Abdel-Ba, Hend; Mohsen Al-mahallawi, Abdulaziz; Mahmoud Ghorab, Dalia",Int J Pharm,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0378517321008292; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijpharm.2021.121023; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378517321008292?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34416332/,625

In this paper, a molecular docking model of SARS-CoV S1 protein in complex with human ACE2 was constructed. The interacting residue pairs within this complex model and their contact types were also identified. Our model, supported by significant biochemical evidence, suggested receptor-binding residues were concentrated in two segments of S1 protein. In contrast, the interfacial residues in ACE2, though close to each other in tertiary structure, were found to be widely scattered in the primary sequence.

Telemonitoring is postulated to bridge this gap by leveraging on internet-of-things and mobile-health technology. This study aims to determine the effectiveness of a novel telemonitoring system (OPTIMUM) in improving the glycaemic control of patients with T2DM compared with standard of care alone. METHODS: This mixed-method study comprises an initial randomised controlled trial involving 330 Asian adults with T2DM, aged 26–65 years old with an HbA1c of 7.5–10%, with 115 in the intervention and control arms each. Those in the intervention arm will use standardised Bluetooth-enabled devices to transmit their capillary glucose, blood pressure and weight measurements to the OPTIMUM system. Primary care physicians and nurses will remotely supervise them according to an embedded management algorithm for 6 months, including tele-education via weekly videos over 8 weeks and asynchronous tele-consultation if abnormal or absent parameters are detected. Patients in both arms will be assessed at baseline, 6, 12 and 24 months post-recruitment. The primary outcome will be their HbA1c difference between both arms at baseline and 6 months. Blood pressure and weight control; quality of life, medication adherence, confidence in self-management, diabetic literacy and related distress and healthcare utilisation using validated questionnaires; and incident retinal, renal, cardiac and cerebrovascular complications will be compared between the two arms as secondary outcomes at stipulated time-points. Intervention arm patients will be interviewed using qualitative research methods to understand their experience, acceptance and perceived usefulness of the OPTIMUM system. DISCUSSION: Overall, this study seeks to evaluate the effectiveness of cultural-adapted telemonitoring system in improving glycaemic control of Asians with type-2 diabetes mellitus compared to standard of care.

Objective:To summarize current research on COVID-19 among people with HIV (PWH) as published through 15 July 2021. Methods: We conducted a search of PubMed, Scopus, preprint databases (medRxiv, bioRxiv), and the references of publications found using key terms relevant to COVID-19 (‘COVID-19’ OR ‘SARS-CoV-2’ OR ‘coronavirus’) AND to HIV (‘HIV’ OR ‘Human Immunodeficiency Virus’ OR ‘AIDS’ OR ‘Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome’). We summarized all articles that reported data or opinions on SARS-CoV-2 and HIV coinfection. Conclusions: Although many initial case series and cohort studies found no increased risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection or severe COVID-19 outcomes among PWH, recent studies have signaled an increased risk for severe COVID-19 disease progression even in the setting of well-controlled HIV. Whether this is due to the increased prevalence of comorbidities in PWH and other social determinants of health is unknown.

This has been proposed to be due to differences in patient populations, the lack of standardized methodologies, and the use of assays that measure distinct aspects of the humoral response. SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were serially measured in sera from a cohort of 44 well-characterized convalescent plasma donors over 120 days post-COVID-19 symptom onset, utilizing eight assays, which varied according to antigen source, the detected antibody isotype, and the activity measured (i.e., binding, blocking, or neutralizing). While the majority of assays demonstrated a gradual decline in antibody titers over the course of 120 days, the two electrochemiluminescence immunoassay Roche assays (Roche Diagnostics Elecsys anti-SARS-CoV-2 [qualitative, nucleocapsid based] and Roche Diagnostics Elecsys anti-SARS-CoV-2 S [semiquantitative, spike based]), which utilize dual-antigen binding for antibody detection, demonstrated stable and/or increasing antibody titers over the study period. This study is among the first to assess longitudinal, rather than cross-sectional, SARS-CoV-2 antibody profiles among convalescent COVID-19 patients, primarily using commercially available serologic assays with Food and Drug Administration emergency use authorization.

A total of 38 asymptomatic adults aged from 23 to 59 with a normal BMI (22.5 kg/m(2)) participated in baseline and post-lockdown measurements that included dietary and physical activity assessment, anthropometric measurements and blood samples; and the lockdown survey which included dietary assessment and questionnaires about changes in lifestyle and physical activity. A decreased diet quality during lockdown was observed (Healthy Eating Index reduced from 64.59 to 61.08), which returned to near baseline post-lockdown. Energy intake decreased during lockdown (p = 0.002) and returned to baseline post-lockdown. Despite lower physical activity levels during lockdown (p = 0.035), we observed no significant changes in body composition. However, we observed a significant increase in serum glucose (p = 0.005), total cholesterol (p = 0.003), and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) (p = 0.049) post-lockdown.
