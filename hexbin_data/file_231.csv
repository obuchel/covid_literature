728,728,728,The crazy-paving pattern: a radiological-pathological correlation,14.348146,6.8433695,2011-01-09,"The crazy-paving pattern is a linear pattern superimposed on a background of ground-glass opacity, resembling irregularly shaped paving stones. The crazy-paving pattern is initially described as the pathognomonic sign of alveolar proteinosis. Nowadays this pattern is a common finding on high-resolution CT imaging, and can be seen in a number of acute and chronic diseases. The purpose of this paper is to illustrate different diseases that cause this crazy-paving pattern and to correlate the radiological findings from computed tomography with the histopathological findings.","De Wever, Walter; Meersschaert, Joke; Coolen, Johan; Verbeken, Eric; Verschakelen, Johny A",Insights Imaging,231,1
747,747,747,Treatment of Neuroterrorism,14.334592,7.151445,2012-01-07,"Bioterrorism is defined as the intentional use of biological, chemical, nuclear, or radiological agents to cause disease, death, or environmental damage. Early recognition of a bioterrorist attack is of utmost importance to minimize casualties and initiate appropriate therapy. The range of agents that could potentially be used as weapons is wide, however, only a few of these agents have all the characteristics making them ideal for that purpose. Many of the chemical and biological weapons can cause neurological symptoms and damage the nervous system in varying degrees. Therefore, preparedness among neurologists is important. The main challenge is to be cognizant of the clinical syndromes and to be able to differentiate diseases caused by bioterrorism from naturally occurring disorders. This review provides an overview of the biological and chemical warfare agents, with a focus on neurological manifestation and an approach to treatment from a perspective of neurological critical care.

Oxidative stress and inflammation are implicated in AMD, but precise mechanisms remain poorly defined. Carboxyethylpyrrole (CEP) is an AMD-associated lipid peroxidation product. We previously demonstrated that mice immunized with CEP-modified albumin developed AMD-like degenerative changes in the outer retina. Here, we examined the kinetics of lesion development in immunized mice and the presence of macrophages within the interphotoreceptor matrix (IPM), between the retinal pigment epithelium and photoreceptor outer segments. We observed a significant and time-dependent increase in the number of macrophages in immunized mice relative to young age-matched controls prior to overt pathology. These changes were more pronounced in BALB/c mice than in C57BL/6 mice. Importantly, IPM-infiltrating macrophages were polarized toward the M1 phenotype but only in immunized mice. Moreover, when Ccr2-deficient mice were immunized, macrophages were not present in the IPM and no retinal lesions were observed, suggesting a deleterious role for these cells in our model. This work provides mechanistic evidence linking immune responses against oxidative damage with the presence of proinflammatory macrophages at sites of future AMD and experimentally demonstrates that manipulating immunity may be a target for modulating the development of AMD.","Cruz-Guilloty, Fernando; Saeed, Ali M.; Echegaray, Jose J.; Duffort, Stephanie; Ballmick, Asha; Tan, Yaohong; Betancourt, Michel; Viteri, Eduardo; Ramkhellawan, Ghansham C.; Ewald, Eric; Feuer, William; Huang, DeQiang; Wen, Rong; Hong, Li; Wang, Hua; Laird, James M.; Sene, Abdoulaye; Apte, Rajendra S.; Salomon, Robert G.; Hollyfield, Joe G.; Perez, Victor L.",Int J Inflam,231,1

Its most prominent pathologic features are lesions involving the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) the Bruch's membrane, the degeneration of photoreceptors, and, in the most aggressive cases, choroidal neovascularization. Genetic associations between the risk of developing AMD and polymorphism within components of the complement system, as well as chemokine receptors expressed on microglial cells and macrophages, have linked retinal degeneration and choroidal neovascularization to innate immunity (inflammation). In addition to inflammation, players of the adaptive immunity including cytokines, chemokines, antibodies, and T cells have been detected in animal models of AMD and in patients suffering from this pathology. These observations suggest that adaptive immunity might play a role in different processes associated with AMD such as RPE atrophy, neovascularization, and retinal degeneration. To this date however, the exact roles (if any) of autoantibodies and T cells in AMD remain unknown. In this review we discuss the potential effects of adaptive immune responses in AMD pathogenesis.","Camelo, Serge",Autoimmune Dis,231,17
2028,2028,2028,Early-Life Exposure to Clostridium leptum Causes Pulmonary Immunosuppression,14.261727,7.163499,2015-11-13,"INTRODUCTION: Low Clostridium leptum levels are a risk factor for the development of asthma. C. leptum deficiency exacerbates asthma; however, the impact of early-life C. leptum exposure on cesarean-delivered mice remains unclear. This study is to determine the effects of early-life C. leptum exposure on asthma development in infant mice. METHODS: We exposed infant mice to C. leptum (fed-CL) and then induced asthma using the allergen ovalbumin (OVA). RESULTS: Fed-CL increased regulatory T (Treg) cells in cesarean-delivered mice compared with vaginally delivered mice. Compared with OVA-exposed mice, mice exposed to C. leptum + OVA did not develop the typical asthma phenotype, which includes airway hyper-responsiveness, cell infiltration, and T helper cell subset (Th1, Th2, Th9, Th17) inflammation. Early-life C. leptum exposure induced an immunosuppressive environment in the lung concurrent with increased Treg cells, resulting in the inhibition of Th1, Th2, Th9, and Th17 cell responses. CONCLUSION: These findings demonstrate a mechanism whereby C. leptum exposure modulates adaptive immunity and leads to failure to develop asthma upon OVA sensitization later in life.","Huang, Fei; Qiao, Hong-mei; Yin, Jia-ning; Gao, Yang; Ju, Yang-hua; Li, Ya-nan",PLoS One,231,1
2221,2221,2221,Influence of the Pressure Difference and Door Swing on Heavy Contaminants Migration between Rooms,14.4957905,6.9954543,2016-05-12,"This paper presents the results of investigations whose aim was to describe the influence of the pressure difference level on the ability of contaminants migration between neighbouring rooms in dynamic conditions associated with door swing. The analysis was based on airflow visualization made with cold smoke, which simulated the heavy contaminants. The test room was pressurized to a specific level and then the door was opened to observe the trail of the smoke plume in the plane of the door. The door was opened in both directions: to the positively and negatively pressurized room. This study focuses on the visualization of smoke plume discharge and an uncertainty analysis is not applicable. Unlike other studies which focus on the analysis of pressure difference, the present study looks at the contaminants which are heavier than air and on “pumping out” the contaminants by means of door swing. Setting the proper level of pressure difference between the contaminated room and the neighbouring rooms can prove instrumental in ensuring protection against toxic contaminants migration. This study helped to establish the threshold of pressure difference necessary to reduce migration of heavy contaminants to neighbouring rooms.","Hendiger, Jacek; Chludzińska, Marta; Ziętek, Piotr",PLoS One,231,1

Beta-arrestin-2 has been reported to be an important protein involved in D(2) dopamine receptor desensitization, which is essential to Parkinson’s disease. Moreover, the potential value of pharmacological inactivation of G protein-coupled receptor kinase or arrestin in the treatment of patients with Parkinson’s disease has recently been shown. We studied the interaction between D(2) dopamine receptor and beta-arrestin-2 and the pharmacological regulation of chemical compounds on such interaction using capillary zone electrophoresis. The results from screening more than 40 compounds revealed three compounds that remarkably inhibit the beta-arrestin-2/D(2) dopamine receptor interaction among them. These compounds are promising therapies for Parkinson’s disease, and the method used in this study has great potential for application in large-scale drug screening and evaluation.","Zhou, Zheng; Liao, Jun-Ming; Zhang, Peng; Fan, Jun-Bao; Chen, Jie; Liang, Yi",Protein & Cell,231,8

This article constitutes a risk-based review aimed at supporting an etiologic scenario of selected, sporadic, protein-associated, i.e., conformational, neurodegenerative disorders (NDDs), and their vascular- and metabolic-associated ailments. Methods: A rationale is adopted, to incorporate selected clinical data and results from animal-model research, complementing epidemiologic evidences reported in two prior articles. Findings: Theory is formulated assuming an underlying conformational transmission mechanism, mediated either by horizontal transfer of mammalian genes coding for specific aggregation-prone proteins, or by xeno-templating between bacterial and host proteins. We build a few population-based and experimentally-testable hypotheses focusing on: (1) non-disposable surgical instruments for sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (sCJD) and other rapid progressive neurodegenerative dementia (sRPNDd), multiple system atrophy (MSA), and motor neuron disease (MND); and (2) specific bacterial infections such as B. pertussis and E. coli for all forms, but particularly for late-life sporadic conformational, NDDs, type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), and atherosclerosis where natural protein fibrils present in such organisms as a result of adaptation to the human host induce prion-like mechanisms.

The use of corticosteroids for childhood Bell’s palsy is controversial. This study aimed to identify clinical characteristics, etiology, and laboratory findings in childhood Bell’s palsy, and to evaluate the efficacy of corticosteroid treatment. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective analysis of children under 19 years of age treated for Bell’s palsy between January 2009 and June 2017, and followed up for over 1 month. Clinical characteristics, neuroimaging data, laboratory findings, treatments, and outcomes were reviewed. Patients with Bell’s palsy were divided into groups with (group 1) and without (group 2) corticosteroid treatment. Differences in onset age, sex, laterality, infection and vaccination history, degree of facial nerve palsy, and prognosis after treatment between the groups were analyzed. RESULTS: One hundred patients were included. Mean age at presentation was 7.4±5.62 years. A total of 73 patients (73%) received corticosteroids with or without intravenous antiviral agents, and 27 (27%) received only supportive treatment. There was no significant difference in the severity, laboratory findings, or neuroimaging findings between the groups. Significant improvement was observed in 68 (93.2%) and 26 patients (96.3%) in groups 1 and 2, respectively; this rate was not significantly different between the groups (P=0.48). CONCLUSION: Childhood Bell’s palsy showed good prognosis with or without corticosteroid treatment; there was no difference in prognosis between treated and untreated groups. Steroid therapy in childhood Bell’s palsy may not significantly improve outcomes.","Yoo, Hye Won; Yoon, Lira; Kim, Hye Young; Kwak, Min Jung; Park, Kyung Hee; Bae, Mi Hye; Lee, Yunjin; Nam, Sang Ook; Kim, Young Mi",Korean J Pediatr,231,1
3786,3786,3786,Late immune consequences of combat trauma: a review of trauma-related immune dysfunction and potential therapies,14.3294935,7.002832,2019-04-24,"With improvements in personnel and vehicular body armor, robust casualty evacuation capabilities, and damage control resuscitation strategies, more combat casualties are surviving to reach higher levels of care throughout the casualty evacuation system. As such, medical centers are becoming more accustomed to managing the deleterious late consequences of combat trauma related to the dysregulation of the immune system. In this review, we aim to highlight these late consequences and identify areas for future research and therapeutic strategies. Trauma leads to the dysregulation of both the innate and adaptive immune responses, which places the injured at risk for several late consequences, including delayed wound healing, late onset sepsis and infection, multi-organ dysfunction syndrome, and acute respiratory distress syndrome, which are significant for their association with the increased morbidity and mortality of wounded personnel. The mechanisms by which these consequences develop are complex but include an imbalance of the immune system leading to robust inflammatory responses, triggered by the presence of damage-associated molecules and other immune-modifying agents following trauma. Treatment strategies to improve outcomes have been difficult to develop as the immunophenotype of injured personnel following trauma is variable, fluid and difficult to determine. As more information regarding the triggers that lead to immune dysfunction following trauma is elucidated, it may be possible to identify the immunophenotype of injured personnel and provide targeted treatments to reduce the late consequences of trauma, which are known to lead to significant morbidity and mortality.","Thompson, Kelly B.; Krispinsky, Luke T.; Stark, Ryan J.",Mil Med Res,231,22

In this study, we use the data from a chronic disease management information system in Shanghai to estimate vaccination coverage and characterize predictors of seasonal influenza and 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPSV23) vaccination among people with chronic disease in Shanghai. METHODS: The Shanghai Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have information systems related to chronic disease management, hospital records, and immunizations. Data from individuals with hypertension, diabetes and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) were abstracted during July 2017. The main outcome was coverage of pneumococcal and influenza vaccination. Vaccination coverage was calculated across demographic groups. Significance in bivariate associations was assessed through Pearson’s chi-square tests, and in multivariable models through logistic regression models with a forward stepwise method to select variables. RESULTS: In the sample of 2,531,227 individuals ≥15 years, 22.8% were vaccinated for pneumonia from January 2013 to July 2017, and the vaccination coverage of influenza in the 2016/17 influenza season was 0.4%. Vaccination coverage was highest in those 70–79 and lowest in those younger than 60. Compared to urban areas, uptake in rural areas was higher for pneumonia vaccination (OR: 2.43, 95% CI: 2.41, 2.45), but lower for influenza vaccination (OR: 0.55, 95% CI: 0.51, 0.59). Having a greater number of chronic diseases was associated with higher likelihood of pneumonia vaccination (3 vs 1: OR: 1.68, 95% CI: 1.64, 1.71), but this relationship was not statistically significant for influenza vaccination. CONCLUSIONS: We found low levels with of pneumococcal vaccination, and extremely low uptake of influenza vaccination among individuals with high risk conditions in Shanghai who should be priority groups targeted for vaccination. Interventions could be designed to target groups with low uptake – like younger adults, and individuals who have not yet retired.","Wang, Yuheng; Cheng, Minna; Wang, Siyuan; Wu, Fei; Yan, Qinghua; Yang, Qinping; Li, Yanyun; Guo, Xiang; Fu, Chen; Shi, Yan; Wagner, Abram L.; Boulton, Matthew L.",BMC Public Health,231,1

One was characterized by ischemia/reperfusion-induced changes in syngeneic transplants while immunologically induced changes dominated in the other allogeneic model. Angiopeptin, 100 μg/kg per day, was administered continuously until the sacrifice of the rats after 8 weeks. No additional immunosuppression was used in either model. An image analysis system was used to quantify the intimal and medial thicknesses of the grafts. In the syngeneic grafts, the intimal thickness was less than 50% of that of control grafts (P<0.05), but no difference was seen in the allogeneic model. The expression of selected cells, TGF-βs and PDGF and PDGF α-receptors was detected immunohistochemically and displayed a similar picture in control and angiopeptin-treated grafts in both models. We conclude that angiopeptin has no clear immunosuppressive properties but may counteract ischemia-induced transplant arteriosclerosis.","Akyürek, M.

Three hypotheses are discussed: (1) autoimmunity, (2) “bystander” demyelination, and (3) immune destruction of persistently infected oligodendrocytes. A paradigm for induction of primary demyelination is proposed in which immune cells recognize “foreign” antigens on the surface of oligodendrocytes in the context of major histocompatibility complex gene products. The final result of this scheme may be “dying-back gliopathy,” the alteration being noted first in the most distal extension of the oligodendrocyte—that is, the myelin sheaths.","RODRIGUEZ, MOSES",Mayo Clin Proc,231,1

Nuclear localisation of Ace2p is restricted to late M and early G1 phases of the mitotic cell cycle. We show here that this nuclear localisation is directly associated with regulation of CTS1 expression. Using a version of Ace2p tagged with a c-myc epitope, we show that the protein is excluded from the nucleus of cells during most phases of the mitotic cell cycle. A mutant derivative in which one threonine and two serine residues, which are candidate phosphorylation sites, were replaced by alanine (to mimic constitutive dephosphorylation) is localised in the nucleus throughout the cell cycle. The mechanism of localisation of Ace2p therefore involves regulation of its phosphorylation state, and closely resembles that used by the homologous transcription factor Swi5p. The wild-type Ace2 protein associates with Cdc28p in vivo, suggesting this may be the kinase that mediates the phosphorylation event. The stability of the protein is greatly reduced in a mutant that is constitutively localised to the nucleus, but is restored in a deletion derivative which remains in the cytoplasm. Ace2p is therefore controlled throughout the cell cycle at three levels: transcription, nuclear localisation, and proteolysis.","O'Conalláin, C.; Doolin, M.-T.; Taggart, C.; Thornton, F.; Butler, G.",Mol Gen Genet,231,1

Following the identification of disseminated Bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG) infections in Canadian First Nations, Métis and Inuit (FNMI) children with unrecognized primary immune deficiencies, a national surveillance study was initiated in order to determine the incidence, diagnosis, treatment and outcome of children with SCID in Canada. METHODS: Canadian pediatricians were asked to complete a monthly reporting form if they had seen a suspected SCID case, from 2004 to 2010, through the Canadian Paediatric Surveillance Program (CPSP). If the case met CPSP SCID criteria, more detailed data, including demographics and clinical information about investigations, treatment and outcome was collected. RESULTS: A total of 40 cases of SCID were confirmed for an estimated incidence of SCID in non-FNMI Canadian children of 1.4 per 100,000 live births (95 % CI 1 to 1.9/100,000). The proportion of SCID cases that were FNMI (17.5 %) was almost three times higher than was expected on the basis of proportion of the pediatric population estimated to be FNMI (6.3 %) resulting in an estimated incidence of 4.4 per 100,000 live births (95 % CI 2.1 to 9.2/100,000) in FNMI Canadian children. The mean age at diagnosis for all SCID cases was 4.2 months (range 1–583 days). There were 12 deaths (30 %; 95 % CI 18–46 %); seven died of confirmed or suspected infections before they could receive an HSCT. CONCLUSIONS: The frequency of SCID cases in FNMI children is higher than in the general Canadian pediatric population. The high mortality rate, due primarily to infection, suggests that early diagnosis by newborn screening followed by HSCT could significantly benefit children with SCID.","Rozmus, Jacob; Junker, Anne; Thibodeau, Melanie Laffin; Grenier, Danielle; Turvey, Stuart E.; Yacoub, Wadieh; Embree, Joanne; Haddad, Elie; Langley, Joanne M.; Ramsingh, Rose Marie; Singh, Veeran-Anne; Long, Richard; Schultz, Kirk R.",J Clin Immunol,231,1

In vivo immuno-histochemical studies of the liver from infected mice have demonstrated that mechanisms other than direct viral injury are in operation. To examine potential mechanisms, the interaction of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated Kupffer cells with MHV 3 was studied. We first observed a dramatic inhibition in viral replication in LPS-treated Kupffer cells explanted from A/J resistant mice. Second, we demonstrated that MHV 3 induced a dose-dependent interleukin 1 (IL-1) activity in the supernatants of infected Kupffer cells of both strains. These results led us finally to examine the antigen-proceesing function of the Kupffer cellsof both strains of mice. No striking differences were observed in the ability of Kupffer cells from resistant or sensitive mice to collaborate with immunocompetent lymphocytes. Our data suggest that Kupffer cells play a double role which is crucial in the pathogenesis of MHV 3-induced hepatitis. First, they act directly as the genetically determined sensitivity of mice to MHV 3 infection is correlated with the efficiency of the antiviral activity induced in Kupffer cells by LPS. Second, they act indirectly through the synthesis of different amounts of IL-1 induced by MHV 3. This hypothesis is further borne out by the effects of indomethacin treatment on the course of MHV 3 infection in A/J resistant mice in vivo.","Keller, F.; Schmitt, C.; Kirn, A.",FEMS Microbiol Immunol,231,22

It was found that the two models have similar accuracy in predicting the airflow field while each of them has its own advantage and drawback in modelling particle concentration and particle-wall interactions. The E-E model is capable of providing a mechanistic description of the inter-phase interactions, whilst the E-L model has obvious advantage in modelling particle-wall interactions.

As a typical RNA virus, FMDV follows a quasispecies dynamics, with the many biological implications of such a dynamics. Mutant spectra provide a reservoir of FMDV variants, and minority subpopulations may become dominant in response to environmental demands or as a result of statistical fluctuations in population size. Accumulation of mutations in the FMDV genome occurs upon subjecting viral populations to repeated bottleneck events and upon viral replication in the presence of mutagenic base or nucleoside analogs. During serial bottleneck passages, FMDV survive during extended rounds of replication maintaining low average relative fitness, despite linear accumulation of mutations in the consensus genomic sequence. The critical event is the occurrence of a low frequency of compensatory mutations. In contrast, upon replication in the presence of mutagens, the complexity of mutant spectra increases, apparently no compensatory mutations can express their fitness-enhancing potential, and the virus can cross an error threshold for maintenance of genetic information, resulting in virus extinction. Low relative fitness and low viral load favor FMDV extinction in cell culture. The comparison of the molecular basis of resistance to extinction upon bottleneck passage and extinction by enhanced mutagenesis is providing new insights in the understanding of quasispecies dynamics. Such a comparison is contributing to the development of new antiviral strategies based on the transition of viral replication into error catastrophe.","Domingo, E.; Pariente, N.; Airaksinen, A.; González-Lopez, C.; Sierra, S.; Herrera, M.; Grande-Pérez, A.; Lowenstein, P.

The so-called “passive vaccination”, i.e., prevention and treatment with specific antibodies, has a proven record and potential in the management of infections and entered the medical arena more than 100 years ago. Progress in the identification of specific antigens has become the hallmark in the development of novel subunit vaccines that often contain only a single immunogen, frequently proteins, derived from the microbe in order to induce protective immunity. On the other hand, the monoclonal antibody technology has enabled biotechnology to produce antibody species in unlimited quantities and at reasonable costs that are more or less identical to their human counterparts and bind with high affinity to only one specific site of a given antigen. Although, this technology has provided a robust platform for launching novel and successful treatments against a variety of devastating diseases, it is up till now only exceptionally employed in therapy of infectious diseases. Monoclonal antibodies engaged in the treatment of specific cancers seem to work by a dual mode; they mark the cancerous cells for decontamination by the immune system, but also block a function that intervenes with cell growth. The availability of the entire genome sequence of pathogens has strongly facilitated the identification of highly specific protein antigens that are suitable targets for neutralizing antibodies, but also often seem to play an important role in the microbe’s life cycle. Thus, the growing repertoire of well-characterized protein antigens will open the perspective to develop monoclonal antibodies against bacterial infections, at least as last resort treatment, when vaccination and antibiotics are no options for prevention or therapy. In the following chapter we describe and compare various technologies regarding the identification of suitable target antigens and the foundation of cognate monoclonal antibodies and discuss their possible applications in the treatment of bacterial infections together with an overview of current efforts.","Giefing, Carmen; Nagy, Eszter; von Gabain, Alexander",Pharmaceutical Biotechnology,231,5

Material and locations The extant fern taxa occupying Africa south of the Sahara, Madagascar and some islands of the South Atlantic. Methods The number of taxa in each area or operational geographical unit (OGU) was scored, and the correlation between this number and physical and climatic variables analysed by standard pairwise and stepwise multiple regression analysis (SPR and SMR). The effects of biological factors such as dispersal capacity, reproductive biology, genetic features and certain physiological adaptations were evaluated by comparing the number of species in each OGU. Floral affinities among OGUs were analysed using non‐metric multi‐dimensional scaling (NMS) and parsimonic analysis of dispersion (PAD), and compared with β‐turnover and inter‐OGU distances. Results OGU area, elevation and the distance between refuges determined the composition of local floras, but only greater OGU area and the existence of higher maximum elevations increased species richness. The distance between refuges also affected the number of endemic species, especially on islands. The biological features studied only slightly influenced fern distribution. The main climatic predictor of species number was humidity. SPR and SMR revealed three main groups of ferns with different ecological trends. NMS and PAD analyses separated the four areas of highest diversity in Africa, three of which are inhabited by ferns with distinct ecological requirements. The fourth area was Madagascar, which shows an accumulation of endemic and relict diversity that is not easy to explain. Main conclusions The distribution of ferns in Africa has been influenced by refuges. These probably allowed many species to recolonize the neighbouring areas after the extinctions of the Pleistocene. Three major components were detected in the African flora: Guinea‐Congolian thermophilous, cold‐tolerant Afro‐montane, and Southern drought‐tolerant elements. These are related to the three main refuge areas, i.e. the Gulf of Guinea area, the eastern tropical region, and the Cape region. Endemicity in ferns was found to be lower than that of seed plants due to the higher dispersability of fern spores. The distance between OGUs seems to be the main predictor of the number of endemic fern species these areas contain.","Aldasoro, J. J.; Cabezas, F.; Aedo, C.",J Biogeogr,231,1

Here we present a phylogenetic analysis that circumscribes the major clades within the spiny solanums and examines the relationships among them, with an emphasis on New World species. Of particular interest is the clarification of the clade limits and species composition of groups that have not been well‐sampled. We also increase sampling of taxa that have been previously analyzed in molecular studies, namely those in the Torva, Micracantha, and Erythrotrichum clades. These groups have convergent morphological characteristics that have challenged taxonomists, making classification difficult. Results from our study delimit 14 clades within the spiny solanums, including the newly designated Asterophorum, Gardneri, Sisymbriifolium, and Thomasiifolium clades. We also establish the placement of species not previously sampled, especially those endemic to Brazil.

Although such information could be invaluable in preventing ventilator-induced lung injury in mechanically ventilated patients, clinical application of EIT is hindered by difficulties in interpreting the resulting images. One source of this difficulty is the frequent use of simple shapes which do not correspond to the anatomy to reconstruct EIT images. The mismatch between the true body shape and the one used for reconstruction is known to introduce errors, which to date have not been properly characterized. In the present study we, therefore, seek to 1) characterize and quantify the errors resulting from a reconstruction shape mismatch for a number of popular EIT reconstruction algorithms and 2) develop recommendations on the tolerated amount of mismatch for each algorithm. Using real and simulated data, we analyze the performance of four EIT reconstruction algorithms under different degrees of shape mismatch. Results suggest that while slight shape mismatch is well tolerated by all algorithms, using a circular shape severely degrades their performance.","Grychtol, Bartłomiej; Lionheart, William R.

We previously analyzed Rns sequences from 18 isolates from morphological groups 2 and 3 and found that they fell into four distinct evolutionary lineages we called sequence types T1‐T4. Here, we analyzed sequences from 53 isolates representing 16 species and including 35 new strains. Eight additional lineages (sequence types T5‐T12) were identified. Four of the 12 sequence types included strains from more than one nominal species. Thus, sequence types could be equated with species in some cases or with complexes of closely related species in others. The largest complex, sequence type T4, which contained six closely related nominal species, included 24 of 25 keratitis isolates. Rns sequence variation was insufficient for full phylogenetic resolution of branching orders within this complex, but the mixing of species observed at terminal nodes confirmed that traditional classification of isolates has been inconsistent. One solution to this problem would be to equate sequence types and single species. Alternatively, additional molecular information will be required to reliably differentiate species within the complexes. Three sequence types of morphological group 1 species represented the earliest divergence in the history of the genus and, based on their genetic distinctiveness, are candidates for reclassification as one or more novel genera.","Stothard, Diane R.; Schroeder‐Diedrich, Jill M.; Awwad, Mohammad H.; Gast, Rebecca J.; Ledee, Dolena R.; Rodriguez‐Zaragoza, Salvador; Dean, Chantal L.; Fuerst, Paul A.; Byers, Thomas J.",J Eukaryot Microbiol,231,1

Thus, a key risk factor for infection transmission should be the rate of hand contact with these areas termed target facial membranes. A study was conducted in which 10 subjects were each videotaped for 3 hr while performing office-type work in isolation from other persons. The number of contacts to the eyes, nostrils, and lips was scored during subsequent viewing of the tapes. The total contacts per subject had sample mean x = 47 and sample standard deviation s = 34. The average total contact rate per hour was 15.7. The authors developed a relatively simple algebraic model for estimating the dose of pathogens transferred to target facial membranes during a defined exposure period. The model considers the rate of pathogen transfer to the hands via contact with contaminated environmental surfaces, and the rate of pathogen loss from the hands due to pathogen die-off and transfer from the hands to environmental surfaces and to target facial membranes during touching. The estimation of infection risk due to this dose also is discussed. A hypothetical but plausible example involving influenza A virus transmission is presented to illustrate the model.","Nicas, Mark; Best, Daniel",J Occup Environ Hyg,231,1

The objective was to describe course of disease, treatment and, for the first time, multimodal monitoring output in a comatose patient suffering RFS. After gastric-banding and severe weight loss, the patient initiated self-starving and was transferred to our intensive care unit (ICU) following rapid refeeding. At arrival, seizures, decrease in consciousness (GCS 7) and suspected acute encephalitis was presented. Serum albumin was 8 g/l. Intracranial pressure (ICP), invasive blood pressure and electrocardiography (ECG) were monitored. Pressure reactivity (PR(x)) and compliance (RAP) were calculated. The patient developed congestive heart failure, anuria and general oedema despite maximal neuro- and general ICU treatment. Global cerebral oedema and hypoperfusion areas with established ischemia were seen. ECG revealed massive cardiac arrhythmia and disturbed autonomic regulation. PR(x) indicated intact autoregulation (−0.06 ± 0.18, mean ± SD) and relatively normal compliance (RAP = 0.23 ± 0.13). After 15 days the clinical state was improved, and the patient returned to the primary hospital. RFS was associated with serious deviations in homeostasis, high ICP levels, ECG abnormalities, kidney and lung affections. It is of utmost importance to recognize this rare syndrome and to treat appropriately.

Recently, a combination of prostaglandin E(2) (PGE(2)) with Toll-like receptor agonists (TLR-P) was proposed as a new standard to generate superior cytokine-producing DCs with high migratory capacity. Here, we compare TLR-P DCs with conventional DCs matured only with the proinflammatory cytokines TNFα and IL-1ß (CDCs), focussing on the interaction of resulting DCs with CD8(+) T-cells. TLR-P matured DCs showed elevated expression of activation markers such as CD80 and CD83 compared to CDCs, together with a significantly higher migration capacity. Secretion of IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, and IL-12 was highest after 16 h in TLR-P DCs, and only TLR-P DCs secreted active IL-12p70. TLR-P DCs as well as CDCs successfully primed multifunctional CD8(+) T-cells from naïve precursors specific for the peptide antigens Melan-A, NLGN4X, and PTP with comparable priming efficacy and T-cell receptor avidity. CD8(+) T-cells primed by TLR-P DCs showed significantly elevated expression of the integrin VLA-4 and a trend for higher T-cell numbers after expansion. In contrast, TLR-P DCs displayed a substantially reduced capability to cross-present CMVpp65 protein antigen to pp65-specific T cells, an effect that was dose-dependent on PGE(2) during DC maturation and reproducible with several responder T-cell lines. In conclusion, TLR-P matured DCs might be optimal presenters of antigens not requiring processing such as short peptides. However, PGE(2) seems less favorable for maturation of DCs intended to process and cross-present more complex vaccine antigens such as lysates, proteins or long peptides.

The immune responses and intestinal microbiota in the treated grass carp were investigated. Results showed that specific anti-CsPmy IgM levels in sera, skin mucus, bile, and intestinal mucus, as well as mRNA levels of IgM and IgZ in the spleen and head kidney, were significantly increased in B.s-CotC-CsPmy-10(11) group. Besides, transcripts levels of IL-8 and TNF-αin the spleen and head kidney were also significantly elevated than the control groups. Moreover, mRNA levels of tight junction proteins in the intestines of B.s-CotC-CsPmy-10(11) group increased.

The B1-subfamily of GPCRs (G-protein-coupled receptors) are medically significant proteins that comprise 15 transmembrane receptor proteins in Homo sapiens. These proteins control the intracellular concentration of cyclic AMP as well as various vital processes in the body. However, little is known about the evolutionary correlation and conservational blueprint of this GPCR subfamily. We performed a comprehensive analysis to understand the evolutionary architecture among 13 members of the B1-subfamily. Multiple sequence alignment analysis exhibited six multiple sequence aligned blocks and five highly aligned blocks. Molecular phylogenetics indicated that CRHR1 and CRHR2 share a typical ancestral relationship and are siblings in 100% bootstrap replications with a total of 24 nodes observed in the cladogram. CRHR2 has the maximum number of extremely conserved amino acids followed by ADCYAP1R1. The longest continuous number sequence logos (74) were found between sequence location 349 and 423, and consequently, the maximum and minimum logo height recorded was 3.6 bits and 0.18 bits, respectively. Finally, to understand the model and pattern of evolutionary relatedness, the conservation blueprint, and the diversification among the members of a protein family, GPCR distribution from several species throughout the animal kingdom was analysed. Together, the study provides an evolutionary insight and offers a rapid method to explore the potential of depicting the evolutionary relationship, conservation blueprint, and diversification among the B1-subfamily of GPCRs using bioinformatics, algorithm analysis, and mathematical models.

The same problem may arise for homologous proteins of different functions if one is newly discovered and the other is the only known protein of similar sequence. It is desirable to explore methods that are not based on sequence similarity. One approach is to assign functional family of a protein to provide useful hint about its function. Several groups have employed a statistical learning method, support vector machines (SVMs), for predicting protein functional family directly from sequence irrespective of sequence similarity. These studies showed that SVM prediction accuracy is at a level useful for functional family assignment. But its capability for assignment of distantly related proteins and homologous proteins of different functions has not been critically and adequately assessed. Here SVM is tested for functional family assignment of two groups of enzymes. One consists of 50 enzymes that have no homolog of known function from PSI-BLAST search of protein databases. The other contains eight pairs of homologous enzymes of different families. SVM correctly assigns 72% of the enzymes in the first group and 62% of the enzyme pairs in the second group, suggesting that it is potentially useful for facilitating functional study of novel proteins.

Temperature is believed to be the most important and can be connected to decomposition by using the accumulated degree days (ADD). The aim of this research was to develop a decomposition scoring method and to develop a formula to estimate the PMI by using the developed decomposition scoring method and ADD. A decomposition scoring method and a Book of Reference (visual resource) were made. Ninety-one cases were used to develop a method to estimate the PMI. The photographs were scored using the decomposition scoring method. The temperature data was provided by the Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute. The PMI was estimated using the total decomposition score (TDS) and using the TDS and ADD. The latter required an additional step, namely to calculate the ADD from the finding date back until the predicted day of death. The developed decomposition scoring method had a high interrater reliability. The TDS significantly estimates the PMI (R (2) = 0.67 and 0.80 for indoor and outdoor bodies, respectively). When using the ADD, the R (2) decreased to 0.66 and 0.56. The developed decomposition scoring method is a practical method to measure decomposition for human remains found on land. The PMI can be estimated using this method, but caution is advised in cases with a long PMI. The ADD does not account for all the heat present in a decomposing remain and is therefore a possible bias.

Here, we obtained the near-complete genome sequence of Desulfovibrio phylotype ZnDsv-02, which attaches to the surface of Trichonympha collaris cells, and compared it with a previously obtained genome sequence of ‘Candidatus Desulfovibrio trichonymphae’ phylotype Rs-N31, which is almost completely embedded in the cytoplasm of Trichonympha agilis. Single-nucleotide polymorphism analysis indicated that although Rs-N31 is almost clonal, the ZnDsv-02 population on a single host cell is heterogeneous. Despite these differences, the genome of ZnDsv-02 has been reduced to 1.6 Mb, which is comparable to that of Rs-N31 (1.4 Mb), but unlike other known ectosymbionts of protists with a genome similar in size to their free-living relatives. Except for the presence of a lactate utilization pathway, cell-adhesion components and anti-phage defense systems in ZnDsv-02, the overall gene-loss pattern between the two genomes is very similar, including the loss of genes responsive to environmental changes. Our study suggests that genome reduction can occur in ectosymbionts, even when they can be transmitted horizontally and obtain genes via lateral transfer, and that the symbiont genome size depends heavily on their role in the symbiotic system.","Takeuchi, Mariko; Kuwahara, Hirokazu; Murakami, Takumi; Takahashi, Kazuki; Kajitani, Rei; Toyoda, Atsushi; Itoh, Takehiko; Ohkuma, Moriya; Hongoh, Yuichi",ISME J,231,1

The early interactions between Mtb and the host innate immune system largely determine the establishment of TB infection and disease development. Upon infection, host cells detect Mtb through a set of innate immune receptors and launch a range of cellular innate immune events. However, these innate defense mechanisms are extensively modulated by Mtb to avoid host immune clearance. In this review, we describe the emerging role of cytosolic nucleic acid-sensing pathways at the host–Mtb interface and summarize recently revealed mechanisms by which Mtb circumvents host cellular innate immune strategies such as membrane trafficking and integrity, cell death and autophagy. In addition, we discuss the newly elucidated strategies by which Mtb manipulates the host molecular regulatory machinery of innate immunity, including the intranuclear regulatory machinery, the ubiquitin system, and cellular intrinsic immune components. A better understanding of innate immune evasion mechanisms adopted by Mtb will provide new insights into TB pathogenesis and contribute to the development of more effective TB vaccines and therapies.","Chai, Qiyao; Wang, Lin; Liu, Cui Hua; Ge, Baoxue",Cell Mol Immunol,231,1

DJ-1, also known as PARK7, has a well-established role as an antioxidant. We have previously shown maintaining oxidative balance via the ATF3-Nrf2 axis was important in protection from ALI. Here, we exclusively characterize the role of DJ-1 in sterile LPS-induced ALI and VILI. DJ-1 protein expression was increased after LPS treatment in human epithelial and endothelial cell lines and lungs of wild-type mice. DJ-1 deficient mice exhibited greater susceptibility to LPS-induced acute lung injury as demonstrated by increased cellular infiltration, augmented levels of pulmonary cytokines, enhanced ROS levels and oxidized by-products, increased pulmonary edema and cell death. In a two-hit model of LPS and mechanical ventilation (MV), DJ-1 deficient mice displayed enhanced susceptibility to inflammation and lung injury. Collectively, these results identify DJ-1 as a negative regulator of ROS and inflammation, and suggest its expression protects from sterile lung injury driven by high oxidative stress.","Amatullah, Hajera; Maron-Gutierrez, Tatiana; Shan, Yuexin; Gupta, Sahil; Tsoporis, James N.; Varkouhi, Amir K.; Teixeira Monteiro, Ana Paula; He, Xiaolin; Yin, Jun; Marshall, John C.; Rocco, Patricia R.M.; Zhang, Haibo; Kuebler, Wolfgang M.; dos Santos, Claudia C.",Redox Biol,231,1

Deprivation of binaural experience during an early critical period is often hypothesized to be the cause of this shortcoming. However, we show that neonatally deafened (ND) rats provided with precisely synchronized CI stimulation in adulthood can be trained to lateralize ITDs with essentially normal behavioral thresholds near 50 μs. Furthermore, comparable ND rats show high physiological sensitivity to ITDs immediately after binaural implantation in adulthood. Our result that ND-CI rats achieved very good behavioral ITD thresholds, while prelingually deaf human CI patients often fail to develop a useful sensitivity to ITD raises urgent questions concerning the possibility that shortcomings in technology or treatment, rather than missing input during early development, may be behind the usually poor binaural outcomes for current CI patients.","Rosskothen-Kuhl, Nicole; Buck, Alexa N; Li, Kongyan; Schnupp, Jan WH",,231,1

We estimate the cost-effectiveness of MT across 32 European countries. METHODS: A Markov model was developed to estimate the cost-effectiveness of MT compared with standard care over a 5-year time horizon. Patients with ischemic stroke eligible for MT were identified from 2017 country-specific incidence data. A societal perspective was adopted, including health, social, and informal care costs, and productivity losses. Model outcomes were expressed as quality-adjusted life years. Sensitivity analyses were conducted to test the robustness of findings. RESULTS: We identified 267 514 ischemic stroke cases that were eligible for MT treatment across 32 European countries. MT was found to be more effective and cheaper than standard care in two-thirds of the countries (21/32) and cost-effective in all but one country (Bulgaria). Across Europe, the intervention was estimated to produce over 101 327 additional quality-adjusted life years (95% uncertainty interval, 65 180–149 085) and cost savings of $981 million (€868 million, 95% uncertainty interval, −1544 to 2564) and of $1.7 billion (€1.5 billion, 95% uncertainty interval, −1.2 to 3.6) in health and social care and societal costs, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: MT is highly likely to be cost-effective compared with standard care across Europe as a whole and in the vast majority of European countries.","Candio, Paolo; Violato, Mara; Leal, Jose; Luengo-Fernandez, Ramon",Stroke,231,1

Some meteorological factors were risks of ambulance transports, but it is difficult to predict in a classically statistical way because Japan has 4 seasons. We tried to make prediction models for ambulance transports using the deep learning (DL) framework, Prediction One (Sony Network Communications Inc., Tokyo, Japan), with the meteorological and calendarial variables. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively investigated the daily ambulance transports and meteorological data between 2017 and 2019. First, to confirm their association, we performed classically statistical analysis. Second, to test the DL framework’s utility for ambulance transports prediction, we made 3 prediction models for daily ambulance transports (total daily ambulance transports more than 5 or not, cardiopulmonary arrest (CPA), and trauma) using meteorological and calendarial factors and evaluated their accuracies by internal cross-validation. RESULTS: During the 1095 days of 3 years, the total ambulance transports were 5948, including 240 CPAs and 337 traumas. Cardiogenic CPA accounted for 72.3%, according to the Utstein classification. The relation between ambulance transports and meteorological parameters by polynomial curves were statistically obtained, but their r(2)s were small. On the other hand, all DL-based prediction models obtained satisfactory accuracies in the internal cross-validation. The areas under the curves obtained from each model were all over 0.947. CONCLUSION: We could statistically make polynomial curves between the meteorological variables and the number of ambulance transport. We also preliminarily made DL-based prediction models. The DL-based prediction for daily ambulance transports would be used in the future, leading to solving the lack of medical resources in Japan.","Watanabe, Ohmi; Narita, Norio; Katsuki, Masahito; Ishida, Naoya; Cai, Siqi; Otomo, Hiroshi; Yokota, Kenichi",Open Access Emerg Med,231,1

Most pressing is an immediate need for the development of novel antibacterial agents to treat Gram-negative multi-drug resistant infections, including the opportunistic, hospital-derived pathogen, Acinetobacter baumannii. Herein we report a naturally occurring 1,2-benzisoxazole with minimum inhibitory concentrations as low as 6.25 μg ml(−1) against clinical strains of multi-drug resistant A. baumannii and investigate its possible mechanisms of action. This molecule represents a new chemotype for antibacterial agents against A. baumannii and is easily accessed in two steps via de novo synthesis. In vitro testing of structural analogs suggest that the natural compound may already be optimized for activity against this pathogen. Our results demonstrate that supplementation of 4-hydroxybenzoate in minimal media was able to reverse 1,2-benzisoxazole’s antibacterial effects in A. baumannii. A search of metabolic pathways involving 4-hydroxybenzoate coupled with molecular modeling studies implicates two enzymes, chorismate pyruvate-lyase and 4-hydroxybenzoate octaprenyltransferase, as promising leads for the target of 3,6-dihydroxy-1,2-benzisoxazole.","Deering, Robert W.; Whalen, Kristen E.; Alvarez, Ivan; Daffinee, Kathryn; Beganovic, Maya; LaPlante, Kerry L.; Kishore, Shreya; Zhao, Sijing; Cezairliyan, Brent; Yu, Shen; Rosario, Margaret; Mincer, Tracy J.; Rowley, David C.",J Antibiot (Tokyo),231,1

IVIG resistance increased risk of coronary complication in KD. And genetic background is involved in the occurrence of IVIG resistance. Our previous study indicated the susceptibility of Multi-drug resistance protein 4 (MRP4) SNPs to KD. This study was to clarify the relationship between MRP4 polymorphisms and IVIG resistance. Methods: We genotyped the six polymorphisms of MRP4 gene in 760 cases of KD using Taqman methods. Results: Among the six polymorphisms, only the rs1751034 polymorphism was significantly associated with IVIG resistance in KD [CC vs. TT: adjusted odds ratio (OR) = 2.54, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.21–5.34; CC vs. TT/TC: adjusted OR = 2.33, 95% CI = 1.12–4.83, p = 0.023]. Combined analysis of three polymorphisms indicated that patients with 3–6 risk genotypes exhibited significantly elevated risk of IVIG resistance, when compared with those with 0–2 risk genotypes (adjusted OR = 1.52, 95% CI = 1.04–2.22, p = 0.0295). Stratified analysis revealed that in term of age and gender, rs1751034 CC carriers were associated with increased risk of IVIG resistance in those aged ≤ 60 months (adjusted OR = 2.65, 95% CI = 1.23–5.71, p = 0.0133). The presence of three or more risk genotypes was significantly associated with risk of IVIG resistance in children younger than 5 years of age and males. Conclusion: Our results suggest that MRP4 rs1751034 CC is associated with increased risk of IVIG resistance in KD.","Wang, Yanfei; Xu, Yufen; Huang, Ping; Che, Di; Wang, Zhouping; Huang, Xijing; Xie, Xiaofei; Li, Wei; Zhang, Li; Gu, Xiaoqiong",Front Genet,231,1

Our objectives were to describe the frequency of Veterans reporting and the factors associated with transportation barriers to or from colorectal cancer (CRC) care visits. METHODS: Between November 2015 and September 2016, Veterans with incident stage I, II, or III CRC completed a mailed survey to assess perceived barriers to recommended care. Participants who reported difficulty with transportation to or from CRC care appointments were categorized as experiencing transportation barriers. We assessed pairwise correlations between transportation barriers, transportation-related factors (e.g., mode of travel), and chaotic lifestyle (e.g., predictability of schedules), and used logistic regression to examine the association between the reporting of transportation difficulties, distance traveled to the nearest Veterans Affairs (VA) facility, and life chaos. RESULTS: Of the 115 Veterans included in this analysis, 18% reported experiencing transportation barriers. Distance to the VA was not strongly correlated with the reporting of transportation barriers (Spearman’s ρ = 0.12, p = 0.19), but chaotic lifestyle was both positively and significantly correlated with experiencing transportation barriers (Spearman’s ρ = 0.22, p = 0.02). Results from the logistic regression model modestly supported the findings from the pairwise correlations, but were not statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS: Transportation is an important barrier to or from CRC care visits, especially among Veterans who experience greater life chaos. Identifying Veterans who experience chaotic lifestyles would allow for timely engagement in behavioral interventions (e.g., organizational skills training) and with support services (e.g., patient navigation).","Jazowski, Shelley A.; Sico, Isabelle P.; Lindquist, Jennifer H.; Smith, Valerie A.; Bosworth, Hayden B.; Danus, Susanne; Provenzale, Dawn; Kelley, Michael J.; Zullig, Leah L.",BMC Health Serv Res,231,1

METHODS: An ecological study was conducted using DR-TB data collected from the Tuberculosis Control Institute of Hunan Province between 2012 and 2018. Spatial clustering of DR-TB was explored using the Getis-Ord statistic. A Poisson regression model was fitted with a conditional autoregressive prior structure, and with posterior parameters estimated using a Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo simulation, to quantify associations with possible risk factors and identify clusters of high DR-TB risk. RESULTS: A total of 2649 DR-TB patients were reported to Hunan TB Control Institute between 2012 and 2018. The majority of the patients were male (74.8%, n=1983) and had a history of TB treatment (88.53%, n=2345). The proportion of extensively DR-TB among all DR-TB was 3.3% (95% CI 2.7% to 4.1%), which increased from 2.8% in 2012 to 4.4% in 2018. Of 1287 DR-TB patients with registered treatment outcomes, 434 (33.8%) were cured, 198 (15.3%) completed treatment, 92 (7.1%) died, 108 (8.3%) had treatment failure and 455 (35.3%) were lost to follow-up. Half (50.9%, n=655) had poor treatment outcomes. The annual cumulative incidence rate of notified DR-TB increased over time from 0.25 per 100 000 people in 2012 to 0.83 per 100 000 people in 2018. Substantial spatial heterogeneity was observed, and hotspots were detected in counties located in the North and East parts of Hunan province. The cumulative incidence of notified DR-TB was significantly associated with urban communities. CONCLUSION: The annual incidence of notified DR-TB increased over time in Hunan province. Spatial clustering of DR-TB was detected and significantly associated with urbanisation. This finding suggests that targeting interventions to the highest risk areas and population groups would be effective in reducing the burden and ongoing transmission of DR-TB.","Alene, Kefyalew Addis; Xu, Zuhui; Bai, Liqiong; Yi, Hengzhong; Tan, Yunhong; Gray, Darren; Viney, Kerri; Clements, Archie CA",BMJ Open,231,1

The aims of this study are to investigate the in hospital mortality for neonates with recurrent EF compared to those with single or no-EF, and determine factors associated with recurrent EF. Neonates’ ≤ 28 days who underwent cardiac surgery from January 2008 to December 2019 were included. EF was defined as unplanned reintubation within 72 h after a planned extubation. 1187 (18 recurrent EF, 84 single EF and 1085 no-EF) neonates were included. Recurrent EF occurred in 18 (17.6%) of 102 neonates undergoing a second extubation. The median time (IQR) to reintubation after the first and second extubations were similar, being 20.9 (3.3–45.2) versus 19.4 (5.5–47) h. The reason for a second-time EF was respiratory in 39% and cardiovascular in 33%. Recurrent EF and single EF was associated with increased mortality (odds ratio, 95% confidence interval (CI) 23.5, 6.9–79.9) and (odds ratio, 95% CI 5.2, 2.3–12.0) compared to no-EF. Based on the final model with risk adjustment, predicted mortality was 29.0% in recurrent EF, 6.5% in single EF, and 1.2% in no-EF. First-time EF due to cardiovascular compromise was associated with recurrent EF (odds ratio, 95% CI 3.1, 1.0–9.7). This study confirmed that patients with recurrent EF have a high morality.

Increased physical activity (PA) is consistently associated with improved health and disease outcomes among early-stage survivors. However, there is a paucity of research on PA in patients with metastatic breast cancer, and existing PA interventions have exhibited low feasibility because of their focus on intense PA and/or requirement of on-site visits. Mobile health (mHealth)–based PA interventions may be particularly useful for patients with metastatic breast cancer because they allow for remote monitoring, which facilitates individual tailoring of PA recommendations to patients’ abilities and may minimize participant burden. However, no studies have examined mHealth PA interventions in patients with metastatic breast cancer. OBJECTIVE: We aim to address these critical research gaps by testing a highly tailored technology-based intervention to promote PA of any intensity (ie, light, moderate, or vigorous) by increasing daily steps in patients with metastatic breast cancer. The primary aim of this study is to test the feasibility and acceptability of the Fit2ThriveMB intervention. We will also examine outcome patterns suggesting the efficacy of Fit2ThriveMB on symptom burden, quality of life, and functional performance. METHODS: The Fit2ThriveMB trial is a two-arm pilot randomized controlled trial that will compare the effects of a smartphone-delivered, home-based PA intervention and an attention-control education condition on PA and quality of life in low-active female patients with metastatic breast cancer. A subsample (n=25) will also complete functional performance measures. This innovative trial will recruit 50 participants who will be randomized into the study’s intervention or control arm. The intervention will last 12 weeks. The Fit2ThriveMB intervention consists of a Fitbit, coaching calls, and the Fit2ThriveMB smartphone app that provides self-monitoring, a tailored goal-setting tool, real-time tailored feedback, app notifications, and a group message board. Assessments will occur at baseline and post intervention. RESULTS: The Fit2ThriveMB study is ongoing. Data collection ended in February 2021. CONCLUSIONS: Data from this study will provide the preliminary effect sizes needed to assemble an intervention that is to be evaluated in a fully powered trial. In addition, these data will provide essential evidence to support the feasibility and acceptability of using a technology-based PA promotion intervention, a scalable strategy that could be easily integrated into care, among patients with metastatic breast cancer.

These interactions are often electrostatic in nature, and much of their rich phenomenology remains unexplored in view of the chemical diversity of lipids, the heterogeneity of their phases, and the broad range of relevant solvent conditions. Here we unravel the electrostatic interactions between zwitterionic lipid membranes and DNA nanostructures in the presence of physiologically relevant cations, with the purpose of identifying new routes to program DNA–lipid complexation and membrane-active nanodevices. We demonstrate that this interplay is influenced by both the phase of the lipid membranes and the valency of the ions and observe divalent cation bridging between nucleic acids and gel-phase bilayers. Furthermore, even in the presence of hydrophobic modifications on the DNA, we find that cations are still required to enable DNA adhesion to liquid-phase membranes. We show that the latter mechanism can be exploited to control the degree of attachment of cholesterol-modified DNA nanostructures by modifying their overall hydrophobicity and charge. Besides their biological relevance, the interaction mechanisms we explored hold great practical potential in the design of biomimetic nanodevices, as we show by constructing an ion-regulated DNA-based synthetic enzyme.","Morzy, Diana; Rubio-Sánchez, Roger; Joshi, Himanshu; Aksimentiev, Aleksei; Di Michele, Lorenzo; Keyser, Ulrich F.",J Am Chem Soc,231,1

ARD can offer the surgical team a “third hand” to perform wider tasks and more degrees of motion in comparison with conventional laparoscopy. We test an eye-tracking based robotic scrub nurse (RSN) in a simulated operating room based on a novel real-time framework for theatre-wide 3D gaze localization in a mobile fashion. METHODS: Surgeons performed segmental resection of pig colon and handsewn end-to-end anastomosis while wearing eye-tracking glasses (ETG) assisted by distributed RGB-D motion sensors. To select instruments, surgeons (ST) fixed their gaze on a screen, initiating the RSN to pick up and transfer the item. Comparison was made between the task with the assistance of a human scrub nurse (HSNt) versus the task with the assistance of robotic and human scrub nurse (R&HSNt). Task load (NASA-TLX), technology acceptance (Van der Laan’s), metric data on performance and team communication were measured. RESULTS: Overall, 10 ST participated. NASA-TLX feedback for ST on HSNt vs R&HSNt usage revealed no significant difference in mental, physical or temporal demands and no change in task performance. ST reported significantly higher frustration score with R&HSNt. Van der Laan’s scores showed positive usefulness and satisfaction scores in using the RSN. No significant difference in operating time was observed. CONCLUSIONS: We report initial findings of our eye-tracking based RSN. This enables mobile, unrestricted hands-free human–robot interaction intra-operatively. Importantly, this platform is deemed non-inferior to HSNt and accepted by ST and HSN test users.

When neutrophils become activated, undergo disruption, or die, this abundant cytosolic neutrophil protein is released. By fervently chelating trace metal ions that are essential for bacterial development, CP plays an important role in human innate immunity. It also serves as an alarmin by controlling the inflammatory response after it is released. Extracellular concentrations of CP increase in response to infection and inflammation, and are used as a biomarker of neutrophil activation in a variety of inflammatory diseases. Although it has been almost 40 years since CP was discovered, its use in daily pediatric practice is still limited. Current evidence suggests that CP could be used as a biomarker in a variety of pediatric respiratory diseases, and could become a valuable key factor in promoting diagnostic and therapeutic capacity. The aim of this study is to re-introduce CP to the medical community and to emphasize its potential role with the hope of integrating it as a useful adjunct, in the practice of pediatric respiratory medicine.","Chatziparasidis, Grigorios; Kantar, Ahmad",Children (Basel),231,1

By designing an efficient hospital management platform to quickly identify the corresponding chronic diseases, it can effectively reduce the labor cost, improve the accuracy of disease identification, and improve treatment efficiency. ADHD is a common behavioral disorder in school-age children, and it is also one of the most common chronic health problems in this period. The internationally recognized prevalence of ADHD is 3%–9%. ADHD often brings adverse effects on children's life and studying and at the same time increases difficulties for their families. Therefore, this paper designs an intelligent management platform for public hospitals based on a deep learning algorithm, evaluates the current situation and influencing factors of ADHD children through the child adaptive behavior scale and the family function assessment scale, and designs its intelligent platform by using a new technology of fNIRS. According to the nonlinearity and unsteadiness of the fNIRS signal, this paper proposes a motion noise removal method based on EMD algorithm methods: to automatically identify children with ADHD and improve the cognitive function of children with ADHD by intervention technology. The data are from the outpatients of the Department of Child Psychology of the First People's Hospital of Tianshui City in Gansu Province in 2018. The results showed that there were significant differences in the adaptive behavior scale (CABS) and fad scores between the two groups. In the seven dimensions of family function, there were significant differences between the two groups (P < 0.01). fNIRS management platform can effectively identify ADHD patients with high recognition accuracy. The intelligent management platform can significantly reduce the number of physical examination personnel, prolong the diagnosis and treatment time, reduce a lot of repetitive work, and improve the efficiency of diagnosis and treatment. At the same time, this technology also provides great help for better research and improvement of ADHD patients and provides a reference for the information intelligent construction of modern hospitals.","Zhao, Hongyi; Chen, Jiangyu; Lin, Yiqi",J Healthc Eng,231,1

However, good uptake is hard to achieve, and our current approaches are failing to engage the most vulnerable. A coherent model of screening behaviour to guide our understanding and intervention development is yet to be established. The present aim was to propose an Integrated Screening Action Model (I-SAM) to improve screening access. The I-SAM synthesises existing models of health behaviour and empirical evidence. The I-SAM was developed following: i) an appraisal of the predominant models used within the screening literature; ii) the integration of the latest knowledge on behaviour change; with iii) the empirical literature, to inform the development of a theory-based approach to intervention development. There are three key aspects to the I-SAM: i) a sequence of stages that people pass through in engaging in screening behaviour (based on the Precaution Adoption Process Model); ii) screening behaviour is shaped by the interaction between participant and environmental influences (drawing from the Access Framework); and iii) targets for intervention should focus on the sources of behaviour - ‘capability’, ‘opportunity’, and ‘motivation’ (based on the COM-B Model). The I-SAM proposes an integrated model to support our understanding of screening behaviour and to identify targets for intervention. It will be an iterative process to test and refine the I-SAM and establish its value in supporting effective interventions to improve screening for all.","Robb, Kathryn A.",Prev Med Rep,231,27

Although substantial efforts have been made to develop therapeutic approaches, core symptoms persist lifelong in ASD patients. Identifying the brain temporospatial regions where the risk genes are expressed in ASD patients may help to improve the therapeutic strategies. Accordingly, this work aims to predict the risk genes of ASD and identify the temporospatial regions of the brain structures at different developmental time points for exploring the specificity of ASD gene expression in the brain that would help in possible ASD detection in the future. A dataset consisting of 13 developmental stages ranging from 8 weeks post-conception to 8 years from 26 brain structures was retrieved from the BrainSpan atlas. This work proposes a support vector machine–based risk gene prediction method ASD-Risk to distinguish the risk genes of ASD and non-ASD genes. ASD-Risk used an optimal feature selection algorithm called inheritable bi-objective combinatorial genetic algorithm to identify the brain temporospatial regions for prediction of the risk genes of ASD. ASD-Risk achieved a 10-fold cross-validation accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, area under a receiver operating characteristic curve, and a test accuracy of 81.83%, 0.84, 0.79, 0.84, and 72.27%, respectively. We prioritized the temporospatial features according to their contribution to the prediction accuracy. The top identified temporospatial regions of the brain for risk gene prediction included the posteroventral parietal cortex at 13 post-conception weeks feature. The identified temporospatial features would help to explore the risk genes that are specifically expressed in different brain regions of ASD patients.","Lin, Yenching; Yerukala Sathipati, Srinivasulu; Ho, Shinn-Ying",Front Genet,231,0

Consistent with the ability of human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) to induce post-translational modifications of cellular proteins to gain a survival advantage, we show that HCMV infection of primary human fibroblasts triggers PAD-mediated citrullination of several host proteins, and that this activity promotes viral fitness. Citrullinome analysis reveals significant changes in deimination levels of both cellular and viral proteins, with interferon (IFN)-inducible protein IFIT1 being among the most heavily deiminated one. As genetic depletion of IFIT1 strongly enhances HCMV growth, and in vitro IFIT1 citrullination impairs its ability to bind to 5’-ppp-RNA, we propose that viral-induced IFIT1 citrullination is a mechanism of HCMV evasion from host antiviral resistance. Overall, our findings point to a crucial role of citrullination in subverting cellular responses to viral infection.","Griffante, Gloria; Gugliesi, Francesca; Pasquero, Selina; Dell’Oste, Valentina; Biolatti, Matteo; Salinger, Ari J.; Mondal, Santanu; Thompson, Paul R.; Weerapana, Eranthie; Lebbink, Robert J.; Soppe, Jasper A.; Stamminger, Thomas; Girault, Virginie; Pichlmair, Andreas; Oroszlán, Gábor; Coen, Donald M.; De Andrea, Marco; Landolfo, Santo",Nat Commun,231,1

Melanoma incidence is highest in patients ≥65 years, but their SLNB positivity rate is lower than in younger patients. CP‐GEP, a model combining clinicopathologic and gene expression variables, identifies primary cutaneous melanoma (CM) patients who may safely forgo SLNB due to their low risk for nodal metastasis. Here, we validate CP‐GEP in a U.S. melanoma patient cohort. METHODS: A cohort of 208 adult patients with primary CM from the Mayo Clinic and West Virginia University was used. Patients were stratified according to their risk for nodal metastasis: CP‐GEP High Risk and CP‐GEP Low Risk. The main performance measures were SLNB reduction rate (RR) and negative predictive value (NPV). RESULTS: SLNB positivity rate for the entire cohort was 21%. Most patients had a T1b (34%) or T2a (31%) melanoma. In the T1‐T2 group (153 patients), CP‐GEP achieved an SLNB RR of 41.8% (95% CI: 33.9‐50.1) at an NPV of 93.8% (95% CI: 84.8‐98.3). Subgroup analysis showed similar performance in T1‐T2 patients ≥65 years of age (51 patients; SLNB positivity rate, 9.8%): SLNB RR of 43.1% (95% CI: 29.3‐57.8) at an NPV of 95.5% (95% CI: 77.2‐99.9). CONCLUSION: We confirmed the potential of CP‐GEP to reduce negative SLNB in all relevant age groups. Our findings are especially relevant to patients ≥65 years, where surgery is often elective. CP‐GEP may guide SLNB decision‐making in clinical practice.","Yousaf, Ahmed; Tjien‐Fooh, Félicia J.; Rentroia‐Pacheco, Barbara; Quattrocchi, Enrica; Kobic, Ajdin; Tempel, Dennie; Kolodney, Michael; Meves, Alexander",Int J Dermatol,231,1

Circular RNA (circRNA) is a type of non-coding RNA that plays an important role in regulating cellular metabolism. However, whether and how circRNA is involved in regulating immune responses in the goat lung has not been reported. Thus, this study was designed to examine the function of circRNA in goats infected with Pasteurella multocida. Goats were assigned into one of two groups: an uninfected control group (CK) and an infected group challenged with P. multocida. Compared with the CK group, which remained healthy, the infected goats showed clinical signs of infection, including depression, cough, nasal discharge, and dyspnea, along with elevated body temperature and lesions in the lung. Whole-transcriptome sequencing and small RNA sequencing were then performed using lung samples from goats from each group. A total of 138 circRNA, 56 microRNAs (miRNA), and 2,673 messenger RNA (mRNA) molecules were significantly differentially expressed in the P. multocida-infected group compared with the CK group. Randomly selected differentially expressed circRNA, miRNA, and mRNA molecules (n = 5 per group) were then validated by quantitative reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction analysis. Gene ontology (GO) analysis of the source genes indicated that six immune-related terms were enriched among the differentially expressed cirRNA molecules, including inflammatory response, immune effector process, cell activation involved in immune response, cytokine-mediated signaling pathway, response to endogenous stimulus, and immune response. The corresponding circRNA molecules were then selected for construction of a competitive endogenous RNA network to identify networks that may be involved in the immune response to P. multocida infection. The results indicated that P. multocida HN01 may cause pneumonia and stimulate an immune response in goats via regulation of circRNA expression. This study presents the first comprehensive circRNA profile in response to P. multocida infection in goats, thus, providing a basis for understanding the function of circRNA in the host immune response to P. multocida infection.","Chen, Qiaoling; Zhang, Zhenxing; Chen, Si; Chen, Jie; Cheng, Yiwen; Liu, Ang; Li, Bin; Chen, Zhen; Zheng, Yiying; Ga, Manchuriga; Du, Li; Wang, Fengyang",Front Vet Sci,231,1

One objective way to monitor it is to assess victims’ stress response by measuring the concentration of their salivary cortisol, the major stress hormone released by the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis. OBJECTIVE: We investigated how the IPV experienced by women in Cameroon affects their stress levels and those of their children. METHOD: We recruited 50 mother–child dyads exposed to IPV and a control group of 25 mother–child dyads. All mothers completed questionnaires, including the Revised Conflict Tactics Scale to assess IPV, the Sense of Coherence Scale, and the Self-Esteem Scale, to assess their psychological resources. Mothers were asked to collect 3 saliva samples from themselves and 3 from their children on a single weekday: immediately after waking up, 30 minutes after waking up, and 45 minutes after waking up. The total cortisol secretion over the first hour after awakening was determined by calculating the area under the curve with respect to the ground (AUCg). RESULTS: Mothers exposed to IPV exhibited higher total post-awakening cortisol concentrations compared with those in the control group. However, no significant difference was found between exposed and non-exposed children. In addition, higher IPV, specifically injuries, was significantly and positively associated with greater AUCg among mothers exhibiting lower self-esteem. When self-esteem was high, however, no significant effect of IPV on AUCg was observed. CONCLUSIONS: Of particular clinical significance is that self-esteem can modulate the stress levels of women exposed to IPV, a valuable insight into the development of effective psychosocial interventions to support IPV victims in sub-Saharan Africa.","Wadji, Dany Laure; Gaillard, Claudie; Ketcha Wanda, Germain Jean Magloire; Wicky, Chantal; Morina, Naser; Martin-Soelch, Chantal",,231,13

The antimicrobial peptide OH-CATH30 (OH30) has a good killing activity against S. aureus and can play a role in accelerating wound healing and immune regulation. Therefore, it shows great potential for wound healing. PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to overcome the short half-life and easy enzymolysis of OH30 by using graphene oxide conjugated with polyethylene glycol to load OH30 (denoted as PGO-OH30), as well as to evaluate its effect on wounds infected by S. aureus. METHODS: PGO-OH30 nanoparticles were prepared by π–π conjugation and characterized. Their cell cytotoxicity, cell migration, infectious full-thickness dermotomy models, and histopathology were evaluated. RESULTS: Characterization and cytotoxicity experiments revealed that the PGO-OH30 drug-delivery system had good biocompatibility and excellent drug-delivery ability. Cell-migration experiments showed that PGO-OH30 could promote the migration of human immortalized keratinocytes (HaCaT) cells compared with the control group (P<0.05). In a mouse model of skin wound infection, PGO-OH30 accelerated skin-wound healing and reduced the amount of S. aureus in wounds compared with the control group (P<0.05). In particular, on day 7, the number of S. aureus was 100 times lower in the PGO-OH30 group than in the control group. CONCLUSION: The PGO-OH30 drug-delivery system had good biocompatibility and excellent drug-delivery ability, indicating its good therapeutic effect on a skin wound-infection model.","Mei, Di; Guo, Xiaolong; Wang, Yirong; Huang, Xiaofei; Guo, Li; Zou, Pengfei; Ge, Delong; Wang, Xinxin; Lee, Wenhui; Sun, Tongyi; Gao, Zhiqin; Gao, Yuanyuan",Int J Nanomedicine,231,1

Therefore, this study aimed to collect qualitative and quantitative evidence of malaria and chikungunya co-infection among febrile patients. Methods: Potentially relevant studies were identified using PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus. The bias risk of the included studies was assessed using the checklist for analytical cross-sectional studies developed by the Joanna Briggs Institute. The pooled prevalence of malaria and chikungunya co-infection among febrile patients and the pooled prevalence of chikungunya virus (CHIKV) infection among malaria patients were estimated with the random effect model. The odds of malaria and chikungunya co-infection among febrile patients were also estimated using a random effect model that presumed the heterogeneity of the outcomes of the included studies. The heterogeneity among the included studies was assessed using the Cochran Q test and I(2) statistics. Publication bias was assessed using the funnel plot and Egger’s test. Results: Of the 1924 studies that were identified from the three databases, 10 fulfilled the eligibility criteria and were included in our study. The pooled prevalence of malaria and chikungunya co-infection (182 cases) among febrile patients (16,787 cases), stratified by diagnostic tests for CHIKV infection, was 10% (95% confidence interval (CI): 8–11%, I(2): 99.5%) using RDT (IgM), 7% (95% CI: 4–10%) using the plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT), 1% (95% CI: 0–2%, I(2): 41.5%) using IgM and IgG ELISA, and 4% (95% CI: 2–6%) using real-time RT-PCR. When the prevalence was stratified by country, the prevalence of co-infection was 7% (95% CI: 5–10%, I(2): 99.5%) in Nigeria, 1% (95% CI: 0–2%, I(2): 99.5%) in Tanzania, 10% (95% CI: 8–11%) in Sierra Leone, 1% (95% CI: 0–4%) in Mozambique, and 4% (95% CI: 2–6%) in Kenya. The pooled prevalence of CHIKV infection (182 cases) among malaria patients (8317 cases), stratified by diagnostic tests for CHIKV infection, was 39% (95% CI: 34–44%, I(2): 99.7%) using RDT (IgM), 43% (95% CI: 30–57%) using PRNT, 5% (95% CI: 3–7%, I(2): 5.18%) using IgM and IgG ELISA, and 9% (95% CI: 6–15%) using real-time RT-PCR. The meta-analysis showed that malaria and chikungunya co-infection occurred by chance (p: 0.59, OR: 0.32, 95% CI: 0.6–1.07, I(2): 78.5%). Conclusions: The prevalence of malaria and chikungunya co-infection varied from 0% to 10% as per the diagnostic test for CHIKV infection or the country where the co-infection was reported. Hence, the clinicians who diagnose patients with malaria infections in areas where two diseases are endemic should further investigate for chikungunya co-infection to prevent misdiagnosis or delayed treatment of concurrent infection.","Mala, Wanida; Wilairatana, Polrat; Kotepui, Kwuntida Uthaisar; Kotepui, Manas",Trop Med Infect Dis,231,1

Sevelamer carbonate is now available and has been shown to increase serum bicarbonate in adult patients. We conducted a prospective single-center study of pediatric dialysis patients comparing serum bicarbonate before and 3 months after a switch from sevelamer HCl to sevelamer carbonate. Inclusion criteria were a minimum of 3 months of dialysis therapy and either a serum bicarbonate <20 mmol/L or the need for sodium bicarbonate supplementation.

19558,19558,19558,Introduction to the National Cancer Imaging Translational Accelerator (NCITA): a UK-wide infrastructure for multicentre clinical translation of cancer imaging biomarkers,14.568065,7.159735,2021-07-27,"BACKGROUND: Differentiating infiltrating myeloid cells from resident microglia in neuroinflammatory disease is challenging, because bone marrow-derived inflammatory monocytes infiltrating the inflamed brain adopt a ‘microglia-like’ phenotype. This precludes the accurate identification of either cell type without genetic manipulation, which is important to understand their temporal contribution to disease and inform effective intervention in its pathogenesis. During West Nile virus (WNV) encephalitis, widespread neuronal infection drives substantial CNS infiltration of inflammatory monocytes, causing severe immunopathology and/or death, but the role of microglia in this remains unclear. METHODS: Using high-parameter cytometry and dimensionality-reduction, we devised a simple, novel gating strategy to identify microglia and infiltrating myeloid cells during WNV-infection. Validating our strategy, we (1) blocked the entry of infiltrating myeloid populations from peripheral blood using monoclonal blocking antibodies, (2) adoptively transferred BM-derived monocytes and tracked their phenotypic changes after infiltration and (3) labelled peripheral leukocytes that infiltrate into the brain with an intravenous dye. We demonstrated that myeloid immigrants populated only the identified macrophage gates, while PLX5622 depletion reduced all 4 subsets defined by the microglial gates. RESULTS: Using this gating approach, we identified four consistent microglia subsets in the homeostatic and WNV-infected brain. These were P2RY12(hi) CD86(−), P2RY12(hi) CD86(+) and P2RY12(lo) CD86(−) P2RY12(lo) CD86(+). During infection, 2 further populations were identified as 'inflammatory' and 'microglia-like' macrophages, recruited from the bone marrow. Detailed kinetic analysis showed significant increases in the proportions of both P2RY12(lo) microglia subsets in all anatomical areas, largely at the expense of the P2RY12(hi) CD86(−) subset, with the latter undergoing compensatory proliferation, suggesting replenishment of, and differentiation from this subset in response to infection. Microglia altered their morphology early in infection, with all cells adopting temporal and regional disease-specific phenotypes. Late in disease, microglia produced IL-12, downregulated CX3CR1, F4/80 and TMEM119 and underwent apoptosis. Infiltrating macrophages expressed both TMEM119 and P2RY12 de novo, with the microglia-like subset notably exhibiting the highest proportional myeloid population death. CONCLUSIONS: Our approach enables detailed kinetic analysis of resident vs infiltrating myeloid cells in a wide range of neuroinflammatory models without non-physiological manipulation. This will more clearly inform potential therapeutic approaches that specifically modulate these cells.

Youths with AMC require frequent physical therapeutic follow-ups to limit the recurrence of contractures and maintain range of motion (ROM) and muscle strength; however, access to specialized care may be limited because of geographical distance. Telerehabilitation can offer a potential solution for delivering frequent follow-ups for youth with AMC, but research on the use of telerehabilitation in children with musculoskeletal disorders is scarce. OBJECTIVE: The study aims to evaluate the feasibility of delivering a home exercise program (HEP) by using telerehabilitation for youth with AMC. We also aim to explore the effectiveness of the HEP as a secondary aim. METHODS: Youths aged between 8 and 21 years with AMC were recruited at the Shriners Hospitals for Children–Canada. The participants completed baseline and post-HEP questionnaires (the Physical Activity Questionnaire for Adolescents, Pediatrics Outcomes Data Collection Instrument, and Adolescent and Pediatric Pain Tool), and clinicians assessed their active ROM using a virtual goniometer. Clinicians used the Goal Attainment Scale with the participants to identify individualized goals to develop a 12-week HEP and assess the achievement of these goals. Follow-ups were conducted every 3 weeks to adjust the HEP. Data on withdrawal rates and compliance to the HEP and follow-ups were collected to assess the feasibility of this approach. The interrater reliability of using a virtual goniometer was assessed using the intraclass correlation coefficient and associated 95% CI. Nonparametric tests were used to evaluate feasibility and explore the effectiveness of the HEP. RESULTS: Of the 11 youths who were recruited, 7 (median age: 16.9 years) completed the HEP. Of the 47 appointments scheduled, 5 had to be rescheduled in ≤24 hours. The participants performed their HEP 2.04 times per week (95% CI 1.25-4.08) and reported good satisfaction with the approach. A general intraclass correlation coefficient of 0.985 (95% CI 0.980-0.989) was found for the web-based ROM measurement. Individualized goals were related to pain management; endurance in writing, standing, or walking; sports; and daily activities. In total, 12 of the 15 goals set with the participants were achieved. Statistically significant improvements were observed in the pain and comfort domain of the Pediatrics Outcomes Data Collection Instrument (preintervention: median 71; 95% CI 34-100; postintervention: median 85; 95% CI 49-100; P=.08) and Physical Activity Questionnaire for Adolescents (preintervention: median 1.62; 95% CI 1.00-2.82; postintervention: median 2.32; 95% CI 1.00-3.45; P=.046). CONCLUSIONS: The remote delivery of an HEP for youth with AMC is feasible. Promising results were found for the effectiveness of the HEP in helping youths with AMC to achieve their goals. The next step will be to assess the effectiveness of this exercise intervention in a randomized controlled trial.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: We conducted this retrospective observational study including 212 AECOPD patients who required NIMV during hospitalization from January 2015 to December 2020 in the department of respiratory and critical care medicine of Beijing Chao-Yang Hospital (west campus). We reviewed the medical record to determine if NIMV succeeded or failed for each patient, and compared NLR with traditional markers (leukocyte, C-reactive protein [CRP] and procalcitonin [PCT]) between NIMV failure and NIMV success group. Receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curve and multivariate logistic regression analysis were used to assess the accuracy of these markers for predicting NIMV failure. RESULTS: A total of 38 (17.9%) patients experienced NIMV failure. NLR was a more sensitive biomarker to predict NIMV failure (AUC, 0.858; 95% CI 0.785–0.931) than leukocyte counts (AUC, 0.723; 95% CI 0.623–0.823), CRP (AUC, 0.670; 95% CI 0.567–0.773) and PCT (AUC, 0.719; 95% CI 0.615–0.823). There was statistically positive correlation between NLR and leukocytes count (r=0.35, p<0.001), between NLR and CRP (r=0.258, p<0.001), between NLR and PCT (r=0.306, p<0.001). The cutoff value of NLR to predict NIMV failure was 8.9 with sensitivity 0.688, specificity 0.886 and diagnostic accuracy 0.868. NLR>8.9 (odds ratio, 10.783; 95% CI, 2.069–56.194; P=0.05) was an independent predictor of NIMV failure in the multivariate logistic regression model. CONCLUSION: NLR may be an effective marker for predicting NIMV failure in AECOPD patients, and the patients with NLR>8.9 should be handled with caution since they are at higher risk of NIMV failure and require intubation. Further study with a larger sample size and with more data is necessary to confirm our study.","Sun, Wei; Luo, Zujin; Jin, Jiawei; Cao, Zhixin; Ma, Yingmin",Int J Chron Obstruct Pulmon Dis,231,1

METHODS: Arachidonic acid (AA), platelet activating factor (PAF), adenosine 5ʹ-diphosphate (ADP) and collagen were used as inducers. The antiplatelet effects of GBE50, aspirin and 1:1 combination of GBE50 and aspirin were detected by microplate method using rabbit platelets. Synergy finder 2.0 was used to analyze the synergistic antiplatelet effect. The compounds in GBE50 were identified by UPLC-Q/TOF-MS analysis and the candidate compounds were screened by TCMSP database. The targets of candidate compounds and aspirin were obtained in TCMSP, CCGs, Swiss target prediction database and drugbank. Targets involving platelet aggregation were obtained from GenCLiP database. Compound-target network was constructed and GO and KEGG enrichment analyses were performed to identify the critical biological processes and signaling pathways. The levels of thromboxane B2 (TXB2), cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) and PAF receptor (PAFR) were detected by ELISA to determine the effects of GBE50, aspirin and their combination on these pathways. RESULTS: GBE50 combined with aspirin inhibited platelet aggregation more effectively. The combination displayed synergistic antiplatelet effects in AA-induced platelet aggregation, and additive antiplatelet effects occurred in PAF, ADP and collagen induced platelet aggregation. Seven compounds were identified as candidate compounds in GBE50. Enrichment analyses revealed that GBE50 could interfere with platelet aggregation via cAMP pathway, AA metabolism and calcium signaling pathway, and aspirin could regulate platelet aggregation through AA metabolism and platelet activation. ELISA experiments showed that GBE50 combined with aspirin could increase cAMP levels in resting platelets, and decreased the levels of TXB2 and PAFR. CONCLUSION: Our study indicated that GBE50 combined with aspirin could enhance the antiplatelet effects. They exerted both synergistic and additive effects in restraining platelet aggregation. The study highlighted the potential application of GBE50 as a supplementary therapy to treat thrombosis-related diseases.","Ke, Jia; Li, Meng-Ting; Huo, Ya-Jing; Cheng, Yan-Qiong; Guo, Shu-Fen; Wu, Yang; Zhang, Lei; Ma, Jianpeng; Liu, Ai-Jun; Han, Yan",Drug Des Devel Ther,231,22

There are available methods in literature that have used FC patterns as inputs for binary classification models, but the results barely reach an accuracy of 80%. Additionally, the generalizability across multiple sites of the models has not been investigated. Due to the lack of ASD subtypes identification model, the multi-class classification is proposed in the present study. This study aims to develop automated identification of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) subtypes using convolutional neural networks (CNN) using dynamic FC as its inputs. The rs-fMRI dataset used in this study consists of 144 individuals from 8 independent sites, labeled based on three ASD subtypes, namely autistic disorder (ASD), Asperger’s disorder (APD), and pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified (PDD-NOS). The blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signals from 116 brain nodes of automated anatomical labeling (AAL) atlas are used, where the top-ranked node is determined based on one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) of the power spectral density (PSD) values. Based on the statistical analysis of the PSD values of 3-level ASD and normal control (NC), putamen_R is obtained as the top-ranked node and used for the wavelet coherence computation. With good resolution in time and frequency domain, scalograms of wavelet coherence between the top-ranked node and the rest of the nodes are used as dynamic FC feature input to the convolutional neural networks (CNN). The dynamic FC patterns of wavelet coherence scalogram represent phase synchronization between the pairs of BOLD signals. Classification algorithms are developed using CNN and the wavelet coherence scalograms for binary and multi-class identification were trained and tested using cross-validation and leave-one-out techniques. Results of binary classification (ASD vs. NC) and multi-class classification (ASD vs. APD vs. PDD-NOS vs. NC) yielded, respectively, 89.8% accuracy and 82.1% macro-average accuracy, respectively. Findings from this study have illustrated the good potential of wavelet coherence technique in representing dynamic FC between brain nodes and open possibilities for its application in computer aided diagnosis of other neuropsychiatric disorders, such as depression or schizophrenia.","Al-Hiyali, Mohammed Isam; Yahya, Norashikin; Faye, Ibrahima; Hussein, Ahmed Faeq",Sensors (Basel),231,31

We aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of internet-delivered, therapist-supported, and parent-assisted ERP for treatment of tics in children and young people with Tourette syndrome or chronic tic disorder. METHODS: This multicentre, parallel group, single-blind, randomised controlled trial was conducted across two study sites in England. Participants were recruited via 16 patient identification centres, two study sites in England (Nottingham and London), or online self-referral. Eligible participants were aged 9–17 years, had Tourette syndrome or chronic tic disorder, had not received behavioural therapy for tics in the past 12 months or were about to start, and had a Yale Global Tic Severity Scale (YGTSS) Total Tic Severity Score (TTSS) of more than 15 or more than 10 if they had only motor or vocal tics. Patients were excluded if they had started or stopped medication for tics within the past 2 months; had current alcohol or substance dependence, psychosis, suicidality, anorexia nervosa, or suspected moderate to severe intellectual disability; or presented an immediate risk to self or others; or the parent or carer was unable to speak, read, or write in English. Eligible patients were randomly assigned (1:1) by masked outcome assessors to receive 10 weeks of online, remotely delivered, therapist-supported ERP or psychoeducation (active control). Outcome assessors, statisticians, health economists, the trial manager, and the chief investigator were masked to group allocation. Patients were not directly informed of their allocation, but this could be established from the content once treatment commenced and the patients were not, therefore, considered masked to treatment. The primary outcome was YGTSS-TTSS 3 months after randomisation, and analysis was done in all randomised patients for whom data were available for each timepoint and outcome. Safety analysis was by intention to treat. Longer term follow-up is ongoing. This trial is registered with ISRCTN (ISRCTN70758207) and ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT03483493). FINDINGS: Between May 8, 2018, and Sept 30, 2019, we assessed 445 candidates for inclusion in the study. 221 potential participants were excluded (90 did not meet inclusion criteria, 84 declined to participate, and 47 unable to contact family). 224 participants were enrolled and randomly assigned to ERP (n=112) or psychoeducation (n=112). The enrolled patients were mostly male (n=177; 79%) and of White ethnicity (n=195; 87%). 11 patients were lost to follow-up 3 months after randomisation in the ERP group, compared with 12 patients in the psychoeducation group. Mean YGTSS-TTSS at 3 months after randomisation was 23·9 (SD 8·2) in the ERP group and 26·8 (7·3) in the psychoeducation group. The mean total decrease in YGTSS-TTSS at 3 months was 4·5 (16%, SD 1·1) in the ERP group versus 1·6 (6%, 1·0) in the psychoeducation group. The estimated mean difference in YGTSS-TTSS change between the groups adjusted for baseline and site was –2·29 points (95% CI –3·86 to –0·71) in favour of ERP, with an effect size of –0·31 (95% CI –0·52 to –0·10). Two serious adverse events occurred (one collapse and one tic attack), both in the psychoeducation group, neither of which were related to study treatment. INTERPRETATION: ERP is an effective behavioural therapy for tics. Remotely delivered, online ERP with minimal therapist contact time represents an efficient public mental health approach to improve access to behavioural therapy for tics in children and adolescents.

At present, there is a lack of an accepted international consensus on the definition, diagnosis, and treatment of neonatal sepsis; the unclear understanding of the pathogenesis of neonatal sepsis leads to blindness in treatment, which will result in an unsatisfactory therapeutic outcome. In addition, some serious diseases caused by noninfectious factors, such as trauma, stress, asphyxia, and so on, have very similar pathophysiological results with neonatal sepsis. In this review we synthesize the recent advances in definition, incidence, causative agents, risk factors, pathophysiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis and treatment of neonatal sepsis. Of course, there are still many challenges to neonatal sepsis in many ways.","Chen, Sheng; Shi, Yuan",Severe Trauma and Sepsis,231,1

Pneumonia is now the sixth most common cause of death and the most common lethal infection in the United States. Hospital-acquired pneumonia is now the second most common nosocomial infection.2 It was documented as a complication in 0.6% of patients in a national surveillance study,3 and has been reported in as many as 20% of patients in critical care units.4 Furthermore, it is the leading cause of death among nosocomial infections.5 Leu and colleagues6 were able to associate one third of the mortality in patients with nosocomial pneumonia to the infection itself. The increase in hospital stay, which averaged 7 days, was statistically significant. It has been estimated that nosocomial pneumonia produces costs in excess of $500 million each year in the United States, largely related to the increased length of hospital stay.","Winn, Washington C.; LaSala, P.

Our models focus on West Nile (WN) virus, an emerging infectious disease in North America, first identified in Africa. We begin by introducing a minimalist model for WN dynamics to illustrate the processes of model formulation, analysis, and application. We then revisit the question of model formulation to examine how two major biological assumptions affect the model structure and therefore its predictions. Next, we briefly compare these different model structures in an introductory exercise of model parameterization, validation, and comparison. Finally, we address model applications in more detail with two examples of how the model output can usefully be connected to public health applications.","Wonham, M. J.; Lewis, M.

Accurate statistics of community-acquired pneumonia incidence globally or in countries of various regions are lacking. Although the clinical diagnosis of pneumonia is not difficult, the etiology diagnosis to guide targeted specific antimicrobial therapy still poses a challenge even with novel molecular methods. This has led to different approaches and guidelines for the empiric treatment of community-acquired pneumonia, often with broad-spectrum antimicrobial agents which may play a role in fostering the worldwide development of antibiotic resistant bacteria. Severe community-acquired pneumonia, seen mainly at the extremes of age and in persons with chronic underlying diseases, is associated with high mortality of 20–40%. Pneumonia severity tools, such as CURB-65, have been developed over the past decade to assist emergency department physicians to recognize, admit, and implement rapid antimicrobial therapy in severely ill patients. The evidence for the beneficial effects of these tools will be reviewed in this chapter. Issues in the management of severe community-acquired pneumonia that are discussed include: combination with newer macrolides [irrespective of microbial etiology], value of adjunctive therapy such as corticosteroids and statins.","Fong, I.

Pathogens of HIV related pulmonary infections include parasites, fungi, mycobacteria, viruses, bacteria and toxoplasma gondii. According to international reports, pathogens have different geographical distribution, which is also closely related to the socioeconomic status of the region to produce varied AIDS related diseases spectra. For instance, in the United States, pneumocystis carnii pneumonia (PCP), tuberculosis and recurrent bacterial pneumonia (at least twice within 1 year) occur frequently in HIV infected patients. An international report published 10 years ago indicated that PCP is the most common and serious pulmonary opportunistic infections in HIV infected patients. Now its incidence has dropped with the application of antiretroviral treatment and preventive measures. PCP will continue to occur initially in patients who are aware of their HIV infection. In addition, HIV related viral and parasitic infections have been reported both domestically and internationally.

Current applications include: (1) The detection of (unknown) viral infections in clinical samples. (2) Quantitative monitoring of viral load. (3) Genotyping of viral strains. (4) Detection of mutations in the viral genome that are associated with viral resistance. Proper sample acquisition and sample transport, as well as accurate DNA or RNA isolation are a prerequisite for reliable test results in molecular diagnostics of viral infections. In-house as well as commercial assays can be used for the amplification of viral DNA or RNA for the detection of viral infections and viral load monitoring. Many virus species consist of several subspecies, genotypes or variants. This molecular variation has to be taken into account when applying molecular diagnostics. More complicated diagnostics for genotyping or the detection of mutations related to therapy failure often rely on sequencing, although for some viral targets commercial assays are available. In this chapter, applications are described in which molecular methods have become the most important form of viral diagnostics. Molecular test results have a direct impact on patient management and as such, results have to be reliable, standardized and reproducible. Therefore, quality control and standardization are important issues!","Boland, G. J.",Molecular Diagnostics,231,1

Adverse events can be either of infectious nature (Infectious Adverse Reactions to Transfusion–IARTs) or noninfectious (NIARTs). The former are due to viruses, bacteria, or protozoa present in the transfused component. Medical doctors faced with an infectious disease in a hospitalized patient should always collect an accurate clinical history that must include transfusion of blood components and take into consideration that the viral/bacterial/protozoan infection could be related to a transfusion event. If a transfusion-transmitted infection is suspected, the clinician must contact the transfusion center that will provide a look-back of the blood products and a follow-up of the involved donors. NIARTs may be of immunological and nonimmunological nature. This chapter provides an overview of pathogenesis, presentation, therapy, and prevention of the main NIARTs.

Despite significant advancements in survival of oncologic patients who develop critical illness, mortality rates in those requiring invasive mechanical ventilation have improved but remain high. Avoiding intubation is paramount to the management of oncologic patients with ARF. There are important differences between the oncologic patient with ARF compared to the general ICU population that likely underlie the increased mortality once intubated. Noninvasive oxygen modalities have been recognized as an important therapeutic approach to prevent intubation. Continuous low-flow oxygen therapy, noninvasive ventilation, and high-flow nasal cannula are the most commonly used noninvasive oxygen therapies in recent years. They have unique physiologic properties. The data surrounding their efficacy in the general ICU population and oncologic population has evolved over time reflecting the changes in the oncologic population.

Typically, all forms of regulated necrosis are defined by finite rupture of the plasma cell membrane. Apoptosis is characterized by an enzymatic machinery that consists of caspases which cause the morphologic features of this type of cell death. Mechanistically, apoptosis can be instigated by two major cellular signalling pathways: an intrinsic pathway that is initiated inside cells by mitochondrial release of pro-apoptotic factors or an extrinsic pathway that is initiated at the cell surface by various death receptors. In necroptosis, the biochemical processes are distinct from those found in apoptosis; in particular, there is no caspase activation. As such, necroptosis is a kinase-mediated cell death that relies on “receptor-interacting protein kinase 3” which mediates phosphorylation of the pseudokinase “mixed lineage kinase domain-like protein.” While ferroptosis is an iron-dependent, oxidative form of regulated necrosis that is biochemically characterized by accumulation of ROS from iron metabolism, oxidase activity, and lipid peroxidation products, pyroptosis is defined as a form of cell death (predominantly of phagocytes) that develops during inflammasome activation and is executed by caspase-mediated cleavage of the pore-forming protein gasdermin D. Finally, NETosis refers to a regulated death of neutrophils that is characterized by the release of chromatin-derived weblike structures released into the extracellular space. The chapter ends up with a discussion on the characteristic feature of regulated necrosis: the passive release of large amounts of constitutive DAMPs as a consequence of final plasma membrane rupture as well as the active secretion of inducible DAMPs earlier during the dying process. Notably, per cell death subroutine, the active secretion of inducible DAMPs varies, thereby determining different immunogenicity of dying cells.","Land, Walter Gottlieb",Damage-Associated Molecular Patterns in Human Diseases,231,1

In vivo immuno-histochemical studies of the liver from infected mice have demonstrated that mechanisms other than direct viral injury are in operation. To examine potential mechanisms, the interaction of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated Kupffer cells with MHV 3 was studied. We first observed a dramatic inhibition in viral replication in LPS-treated Kupffer cells explanted from A/J resistant mice. Second, we demonstrated that MHV 3 induced a dose-dependent interleukin 1 (IL-1) activity in the supernatants of infected Kupffer cells of both strains. These results led us finally to examine the antigen-proceesing function of the Kupffer cellsof both strains of mice. No striking differences were observed in the ability of Kupffer cells from resistant or sensitive mice to collaborate with immunocompetent lymphocytes. Our data suggest that Kupffer cells play a double role which is crucial in the pathogenesis of MHV 3-induced hepatitis. First, they act directly as the genetically determined sensitivity of mice to MHV 3 infection is correlated with the efficiency of the antiviral activity induced in Kupffer cells by LPS. Second, they act indirectly through the synthesis of different amounts of IL-1 induced by MHV 3. This hypothesis is further borne out by the effects of indomethacin treatment on the course of MHV 3 infection in A/J resistant mice in vivo.","Keller, F.; Schmitt, C.; Kirn, A.",FEMS Microbiol Lett,231,33

The aim of this research is to study the phylogeny estimation from Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) haplotypes under the maximum parsimony criterion (MPPEP-SNP). Previous exact methods have modeled the mentioned problem as a Mixed Integer Programming (MIP) problem. Since the problem, in general, proved to be NP-hard which causes MIP models to take long runtime for solving large-scale instances, the need for non-exact methods is obvious. In this paper, the authors propose a heuristic algorithm that attempts to find the MPPEP-SNP solution in several stages by solving a specific MIP model in each stage. Created based on network flows formulation, MIP models appearing in each stage are very small; therefore, their exact solutions could be found practically very fast. In order to evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm, it has been tested on both simulated and real instances and compared with Pars and Flow-RM as two of the best known methods. Our numerical experiments show that the proposed method can compete with the previous methods in terms of accuracy, runtime, and specially the largeness of the solved instances.","Feizabadi, R.; Bagherian, M.; Vaziri, H.

This philosophy is particularly pertinent in Aotearoa-New Zealand because of the country’s relatively isolated island ecosystem, economic reliance on agriculture and its intensification, and existing indigenous worldview that emphasises holism and interconnectivity between humans, animals and the environment. In New Zealand, the One Health Aotearoa (OHA) alliance was established in order to better connect researchers and to address a growing number of infectious diseases challenges. The emphasis of OHA is to bring together and facilitate interactions between people from diverse disciplines, link to stakeholders and communities, and engage with policy-makers, government operational agencies, and funders, thus providing a holistic and integrative systems-thinking approach to address priority questions and achieve desired outcomes in One Health. The initial focus of OHA has been on infectious diseases, but there is increasing recognition of the potential benefits of the alliance to address broader complex issues. Greater involvement and overlap of the environmental sciences, human and animal health sciences, social science, and indigenous kaupapa Māori research is particularly critical for ensuring its success within the New Zealand context. Given the economic and cultural importance of New Zealand’s “clean, green” image, a One Health approach that draws strongly on the environmental sciences makes particular sense. Furthermore, as the global environment becomes increasingly stressed by anthropogenic pressures our research may hold potential solutions for similar challenges elsewhere.","Harrison, Sarah; Baker, Michael G.; Benschop, Jackie; Death, Russell G.; French, Nigel P.; Harmsworth, Garth; Lake, Robin J.; Lamont, Iain L.; Priest, Patricia C.; Ussher, James E.; Murdoch, David R.",One Health Outlook,231,17

The object of disaster risk science research is the “disaster system” consisting of hazard, the geographical environment, and exposed units, with features of regionality, interconnectedness, coupling, and complexity. Environmental stability, hazard threat, and socioeconomic vulnerability together determine the way that disasters are formed, establish the spatial extent of disaster impact, and generate the scale of losses. In the formation of a disaster, a conducive environment is the prerequisite, a hazard is the necessary condition, and socioeconomic exposure is the sufficient condition. The geographical environment affects local hazard intensity and therefore can change the pattern of loss distribution. Regional multi-hazard, disaster chain, and disaster compound could induce complex impacts, amplifying or attenuating hazard intensity and changing the scope of affected areas. In the light of research progress, particularly in the context of China, we propose a three-layer disaster risk science disciplinary structure, which contains three pillars (disaster science, disaster technology, and disaster governance), nine core areas, and 27 research fields. Based on these elements, we discuss the frontiers in disaster risk science research.","Shi, Peijun; Ye, Tao; Wang, Ying; Zhou, Tao; Xu, Wei; Du, Juan; Wang, Jing’ai; Li, Ning; Huang, Chongfu; Liu, Lianyou; Chen, Bo; Su, Yun; Fang, Weihua; Wang, Ming; Hu, Xiaobin; Wu, Jidong; He, Chunyang; Zhang, Qiang; Ye, Qian; Jaeger, Carlo; Okada, Norio",Int J Disaster Risk Sci,231,22

However, it is only effective when training is regular and exercise techniques are correct. This paper presents a prototype of an augmented reality exergame for elderly people to perform physical exercise at home. The research is focusing on developing a solution for both above-mentioned issues: augmentation with Microsoft Kinect and various sensors assists in creating a safe game environment, which can helps to perform exercises with right technique; gamification elements contribute to users’ motivation to train regularly. A user-centered design approach was adopted to guide the design and development iterative process. User testing of the first prototype was performed and demonstrated positive attitudes from participants.

Understanding the genetic mechanisms of immune response to viral infection provides insight into disease etiology and therapeutic opportunities. METHODS: We conducted a comprehensive study including genome-wide and transcriptome-wide association analyses to identify genetic loci associated with immunoglobulin G antibody response to 28 antigens for 16 viruses using serological data from 7924 European ancestry participants in the UK Biobank cohort. RESULTS: Signals in human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class II region dominated the landscape of viral antibody response, with 40 independent loci and 14 independent classical alleles, 7 of which exhibited pleiotropic effects across viral families. We identified specific amino acid (AA) residues that are associated with seroreactivity, the strongest associations presented in a range of AA positions within DRβ1 at positions 11, 13, 71, and 74 for Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), Varicella zoster virus (VZV), human herpesvirus 7, (HHV7), and Merkel cell polyomavirus (MCV). Genome-wide association analyses discovered 7 novel genetic loci outside the HLA associated with viral antibody response (P < 5.0 × 10(−8)), including FUT2 (19q13.33) for human polyomavirus BK (BKV), STING1 (5q31.2) for MCV, and CXCR5 (11q23.3) and TBKBP1 (17q21.32) for HHV7. Transcriptome-wide association analyses identified 114 genes associated with response to viral infection, 12 outside of the HLA region, including ECSCR: P = 5.0 × 10(−15) (MCV), NTN5: P = 1.1 × 10(−9) (BKV), and P2RY13: P = 1.1 × 10(−8) EBV nuclear antigen. We also demonstrated pleiotropy between viral response genes and complex diseases, from autoimmune disorders to cancer to neurodegenerative and psychiatric conditions. CONCLUSIONS: Our study confirms the importance of the HLA region in host response to viral infection and elucidates novel genetic determinants beyond the HLA that contribute to host-virus interaction.","Kachuri, Linda; Francis, Stephen S.; Morrison, Maike L.; Wendt, George A.; Bossé, Yohan; Cavazos, Taylor B.; Rashkin, Sara R.; Ziv, Elad; Witte, John S.",Genome Med,231,1

The Quantra QStat System is a cartridge-based point of care VET device that measures changes in clot stiffness during coagulation and fibrinolysis using ultrasound detection of resonance. The objective of this study was to assess the ability of the Quantra QStat System to detect coagulopathies in trauma patients. METHODS: A multicenter observational study was conducted on adult subjects at two level 1 trauma centers. For each subject, whole blood samples were drawn upon arrival to the emergency department and again, in some cases, after administration of blood products and/or antifibrinolytics. Samples were analyzed on the Quantra in parallel to ROTEM delta. The QStat cartridge provides measures of Clot Time (CT), Clot Stiffness (CS), Fibrinogen and Platelet Contributions to clot stiffness (FCS and PCS), and Clot Stability to Lysis (CSL). Data analyses included linear regression of Quantra and ROTEM parameters and an assessment of the concordance of the two devices for the assessment of hyperfibrinolysis. RESULTS: A total of 56 patients were analyzed. 42% of samples had a low QStat CS value suggestive of an hypocoagulable state. The low stiffness values could be attributed to either low PCS, FCS or combination. Additionally, 13% of samples showed evidence of hyperfibrinolysis based on the QStat CSL parameter. Samples analyzed with ROTEM assays showed a lower prevalence of low CS and hyperfibrinolysis based on EXTEM and FIBTEM results. The correlation of CS, FCS and CT versus equivalent ROTEM parameters was strong with r-values of 0.83, 0.79 and 0.79, respectively. DISCUSSION: This first clinical experience with the Quantra in trauma patients showed that the QStat Cartridge was strongly correlated with ROTEM parameters and that it could detect coagulopathies associated with critical bleeding.

Previous studies showed that procrastination is associated with executive dysfunctions that seem to be particularly strong in punishing contexts. In the present event-related potential (ERP) study a monetary version of the parametric Go/No-Go task was performed by high and low academic procrastinators to verify the influence of motivational context (reward vs. punishment expectation) and task difficulty (easy vs. hard) on procrastination-related executive dysfunctions. The results revealed increased post-error slowing along with reduced P300 and error-related negativity (ERN) amplitudes in high (vs. low) procrastination participants—effects that indicate impaired attention and error-related processing in this group. This pattern of results did not differ as a function of task difficulty and motivation condition. However, when the task got more difficult executive attention deficits became even more apparent at the behavioral level in high procrastinators, as indexed by increased reaction time variability. The findings substantiate prior preliminary evidence that procrastinators show difficulties in certain aspects of executive functioning (in attention and error processing) during execution of task-relevant behavior, which may be more apparent in highly demanding situations.","Michałowski, Jarosław M.; Wiwatowska, Ewa; Weymar, Mathias",Sci Rep,231,1

This paper contributes to fill this research gap by drawing on a multi-site case study in the Yucatán region in Mexico. By applying regression analysis, the significance of the association between home garden diversity and food security is confirmed. Plant diversity is found to have a positive association with food consumption scores and the frequency of vegetable intakes. The number of animals used for food purposes is also found to have positive and significant associations with food consumption scores and frequency of meat intakes. However, the dimension and the significance of these positive associations were found to vary among communities and quantiles of the distribution of food security measures. In the households studied, younger individuals and better-educated people, males and Spanish speakers were more likely to engage in jobs in urban areas. Engagement in urban jobs was found to involve complementarities with the overall plant diversity of home gardens, but also trade-offs with the diversity of vegetables and other herbs used for food purposes and with the abundance of animals raised for food purposes.

Results showed that stock markets were highly connected during the entire period, but the dynamic spillovers reached unprecedented heights during the COVID-19 pandemic in the first quarter of 2020. Moreover, we found that the European stock markets (except Italy) transmitted more spillovers to all other stock markets than they received, primarily during the COVID-19 outbreak. Further analysis using a nonlinear framework showed that the dynamic connectedness was more pronounced for negative than for positive returns. Also, findings showed that the direction of the EPU effect on net connectedness changed during the pandemic onset, indicating that information spillovers from a given market may signal either good or bad news for other markets, depending on the prevailing economic situation.

This article summarizes the so far published results of these surveys. A total of 1547 psychotherapists took part in the first online survey, which was conducted in the first weeks of the first COVID-19 lockdown in Austria. The results showed that psychotherapists increasingly replaced psychotherapy in personal contact with psychotherapy at a distance (telephone or internet) during the lockdown. Increased stress level and job-related worries were mainly reported by psychotherapists who were financially reliant on the income gained from psychotherapy. The experiences with psychotherapy at a distance were described as more positively than previously expected. Nonetheless, psychotherapy at a distance was viewed as not fully comparable to face-to-face psychotherapy sessions. In a second survey, which was conducted after the first lockdown ended (summer 2020), 222 Austrian psychotherapists participated. The aim of this survey was to examine the change in treatment format (personal to digital or digital to personal) more closely. At the same time as the second survey, a third online survey was carried out in which 139 patients of the 222 Austrian psychotherapists took part in order to examine the patients’ perspective on changing the treatment format. First results show that psychotherapists and patients experienced a difference in terms of the therapeutic interventions used when changing the treatment format. Moreover, the subjective meaning of different areas of life was changed in the COVID-19 pandemic compared to the time before COVID-19. The evaluations to date show that the COVID-19 pandemic has a significant impact on the psychotherapeutic practice in Austria. Further quantitative and qualitative evaluations of the data will provide even more in-depth knowledge.","Probst, Thomas; Haid, Barbara; Schimböck, Wolfgang; Stippl, Peter; Humer, Elke",Psychother Forum,231,20

Our analysis underlines the state as a symbiotic partner of corporations, and places workers’ illnesses and deaths in a necropolitical framework that demands attention to the state’s tacit approval of inhumane working conditions, use of law to keep packing plants open, and attempts to limit the liability of corporations for any deaths or illnesses they have caused.","Ken, Ivy; León, Kenneth Sebastian",,231,1

Healthcare sustainability has recently become a mandatory GMC learning outcome for undergraduates, but expertise amongst faculty and time within the curriculum are limited. We piloted an E-module that uses surgical case studies to teach these concepts. METHOD: Evidenced-based multi-media learning principles were used to develop the module. 3(rd) and 4(th) year students at Brighton and Sussex Medical School were invited to partake and complete pre- and post-module questionnaires comprising 5-point Likert scales and white-space questions. The primary outcome measures were changes in student-reported understanding of four key concepts: Environmental impact of healthcare Influence of climate change on health. Principles of sustainable clinical practice. Health co-benefits of climate change mitigation. RESULTS: 33 students completed the E-module. Questionnaire results indicated a significant increase in understanding of all key concepts (p < 0.001). Students most commonly rated improving sustainability of healthcare as ‘extremely important’. Common themes within white space responses included the importance of preventative medicine and that the module was informative, interactive, user-friendly, and engaging. The majority (81%) strongly agreed that all undergraduates should undertake this module. CONCLUSIONS: This E-module is an effective and COVID-19-safe resource. Adapting this module for postgraduate surgical education should be explored.","Dunne, H; Rizan, C; Jones, A; Bhutta, M; Okorie, M",Br J Surg,231,0

The delivery of a national spinal service for emergent surgery, elective surgery and outpatient assessment has been incredibly challenging. METHOD: Prospectively collected data regarding referrals to, and operative workload of, the Irish National Spinal Injuries Unit (NSIU) during the period of national lockdown in response to the COVID-19 pandemic was compared to the same period in 2019. RESULTS: During the period of national lockdown there was a 47% decrease in the number of urgent referrals to the NSIU and a 61% reduction in the number of surgical cases performed. A particularly concerning finding was that for surgical cases there was a 400% increase in attempted suicide as the cause of injury with this cohort representing 11% of all surgical cases performed during the pandemic lockdown. The introduction of a national instant messaging application (Siilo) referral group resulted in a median time to first response by a National Spinal Injuries Unit (NSIU) surgeon of 15.5 minutes. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on the provision of a national spinal service, however innovative strategies have been adopted to protect the capacity to provide urgent care.","Power, F; Juhdi, A; Macken, M; Synnott, K A; Butler, J S",Br J Surg,231,16

INTRODUCTION: The Russian Federation reported one of the largest number of COVID-19 infections. In spring 2020 social distancing, travel bans, the cancellation of sporting and other mass participation events, and changes to work practices have dramatically affected daily life throughout the country. Major restrictions were introduced on the 28th March 2020 with the level of restrictions varied depending on the epidemiology of the virus from region to region. Cities with a large number of cases had the most strict restrictions such as limitations on any outdoor activities. In cities with a smaller number of cases limitations were less strict, especially with outdoor activities. Indoor sport activities were limited across the country and outdoor sports were restricted – depending on the situation in the region. The aim of this study is to estimate the impact of COVID-19 on the levels of physical activity among adults in Russia. METHODS: Cross-sectional data were collected during the period of tightest restrictions between 26 April 2020 and 6 June 2020. The link on the on-line survey was distributed through the regional centers of public health. Eligible participants included all Russian adults aged 18 years and over. Participants reported frequency and duration of walking, moderate- and vigorous-intensity physical activity, and muscle strengthening activities before COVID-19 and during the past seven days. RESULTS: A convenience sample of 2432 adults from 62 regions of Russia completed a 15-min self-report questionnaire. Participants were primarily female (83%). Compared with before COVID-19, physical activity was adversely affected during COVID-19. The average time spent in MPA and VPA each declined by around 12 minutes per day (42.43 ± 37.57 to 30.44 ± 35.35 and 37.79 ± 37.80 to 26.56 ± 34.69, respectively [all P < 0.001]). The number of minutes per day spent walking decreased by around 20 minutes from 60.5 ± 38.66 to 40.83 ± 38.6 (P < 0.001). The proportion of participants who met the WHO Guidelines for physical activity declined from 68% to 49% (P < 0.001). The proportion who participated in muscle strengthening activities for 2 or more days per week declined from 53% to 45% (P < 0.001). Compared with those who did not use online PA resources, those who did were 1.4 (95%CI 1.3, 1.5) and 1.9 (95%CI 1.8, 2.1) times more likely to meet the recommendations for PA and for muscle-strengthening activities, respectively. CONCLUSION: Effective health promotion strategies directed at adopting or maintain positive health-related behaviors such as targeted social media messaging and balanced media reporting, should be used to increase the physical activity during these unprecedented times.","Kontsevaya, A; Mukaneeva, D; Myrzamatova, A; Khudyakov, M; Drapkina, O",Eur J Prev Cardiol,231,1

Previous studies in our laboratory identified significantly higher in vitro T lymphocyte responses to C. pneumoniae in children with asthma compared to healthy controls which may indicate the presence of T effector memory (TEM) lymphocytes. AIM: In the present study, healthy subjects were screened for the presence of TEM cells and their cytokines. CCR7 negative effector TEMs may indicate persistent infection with C. pneumoniae. METHODS: Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) (1×10(6)/mL) from adult non-asthmatic subjects were infected for 1h ± C. pneumoniae TW-183 at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) = 0.1 and cultured (48 hrs). Distributions of lymphocytes (CD4+, CD8+) and TEM cells (CD4+CCR7+CD45RA+CD154+, CD8+CCR7+CD45RA+CD154+) were determined. Levels of intracellular interleukin (IL)-2, IL-4, and interferon (IFN)-gamma were measured (flow microfluorimetry); IFN-gamma was measured in supernatants (ELISA). RESULTS: C. pneumoniae infection led to a decrease in numbers of CD8+ TEM and CD8+CD154+ cells; CD4+TEM and CD4+CD154+ cells did not change. Numbers of TEM cells (CD4+IL-2+, CD8+ IL-2+) also decreased. However, number of TEM cells (CD4+IL4-+, CD8+ IL-4+) and (CD4+ IFN-gamma+, CD8+IFN-gamma+) did not change. When stratified according to IFN-gamma+ status, numbers of CD4+ IL-2+ and CD4+IL-4+ TEMs increased; CD8+IL-2+ and CD8+ IL-4+ TEMs decreased. CONCLUSION: C. pneumoniae-induced PBMC IFN-gamma+ responses increased numbers of CD4+ IL-2+ and CD4+IL-4+ TEM cells, while CD8+IL-2+ and CD8+IL-4+ TEMs decreased. Production of IFN-gamma by C. pneumoniae infected PBMC should be further studied as a biomarker of persistent infection in humans.","Smith-Norowitz, Tamar A; Shidid, Sarah; Norowitz, Yitzchok M; Kohlhoff, Stephan",J Blood Med,231,1

Objectives: (1) To compare Internet use and problematic use among seniors in Switzerland and Poland; (2) To examine the relationships between problematic internet use, impulsivity traits and well-being as previous studies showed that internet can be used to cope with negative emotions or life dissatisfaction. Methods: A cross-sectional survey conducted between June 2016 and April 2017 with 264 older internet users aged above 60 years old recruited in Switzerland (88) and Poland (176) assessing sociodemographic variables, online activities, problematic internet use, impulsivity traits and well-being. Results: The two groups differed in their reported online activities in that Polish participants reported more searching for information and buying, whereas Swiss participants reported significantly greater problematic internet use than Polish participants. Finally, a multiple linear regression analysis performed on the whole sample indicated that lower well-being and being a Swiss participant were both significantly associated with greater problematic internet use, after age, gender, level of education, impulsivity traits have been controlled for. Discussion: Swiss seniors showed a more problematic internet use than Polish participants who focused more in their online activities on utility use of internet. The relationships between problematic internet use and well-being suggest that older adults use internet mainly to cope with negative emotion or life dissatisfaction. Socio-cultural differences that could account for these group differences as well as difference with young adults are discussed.","Rochat, Lucien; Wilkosc-Debczynska, Monika; Zajac-Lamparska, Ludmila; Rothen, Stéphane; Andryszak, Paulina; Gaspoz, Julie; Colombo, Laura; Khazaal, Yasser; Achab, Sophia",Front Psychiatry,231,1
55276,55276,55276,Editor’s Focus,14.608198,6.864388,2021-07-01,"INTRODUCTION: COVID‐19 pandemic has been one of the main global health concerns in 2020, and many aspects of the disease remain enigmatic. While some patients infected with the disease‐causing virus SARS‐CoV2 have no or mild symptoms, others experience severe symptoms requiring hospitalization. Of these more severe patients, some remain stable while others experience cytokine storm syndrome or an exaggerated immune response that has been correlated with disease severity and progression of acute respiratory deterioration. It is currently unknown why some patients with COVID‐19 demonstrate this response and others do not. In light of the apparent prominent role of the inflammatory mediators (i.e. cytokines) in COVID‐19 pathogenesis, the ability to identify screening tools not only for the SARS‐CoV2 virus but also for cytokines is important. The present investigation was designed to identify the urinary cytokine signature in COVID‐19 patients. METHODS: The study enrolled 17 COVID‐19 patients and 10 control subjects (SARS‐CoV‐2 negative) 18 years or older with glomerular filtration rate of > 60mL/min. Urine samples were collected and cytokines quantitated using the Luminex multiplex assay. The cytokines analyzed were growth‐regulated oncogene (GRO), interleukin‐8 (IL‐8), and interleukin‐6 (IL‐6). RESULTS: The levels of GRO and IL‐6 were significantly elevated in urine samples obtained from COVID‐19 patients compared to controls (mean 16.8 pg/ml vs. 9.2 pg/ml ± 2.39, p < 0.0171 and mean 16.8 pg/ml vs 9.2 pg/ml ± 2.42, p < 0.0157, respectively). Conversely, IL‐8 level was similar between COVID‐19 patients and controls (15.6 pg/ml vs 11.3 pg/ml ± 1.3, p<0.1833). CONCLUSION: The present investigation found that the levels of urinary cytokines GRO and IL‐6 were significantly elevated in COVID‐19 patients compared to controls and may serve as urinary biomarkers of disease progression. Furthermore, IL‐8 although elevated in COVID‐19 patients, did not reach statistical significance in our population sample. The findings of this proof of concept study underscore that the urinary cytokines may serve as prognostic and diagnostic accessible biomarkers in COVID‐19.","Komnenov, Dragana; Dhar, Nivedita; Lamb, Laura; Wills, Melissa; Khaliq, Fareea; Timar, Ryan; Chancellor, Michael; Bartolone, Sarah; Ward, Elijah; Rossi, Noreen; Bitar, Ali; Dhar, Sorabh; Cohn, Johnathan",FASEB J,231,5

However, older adults in China remain digital refugees amid the rapid development of digital information technology. This study attempts to scientifically answer how Internet use affects the subjective welfare of older adults. Method: Using data from the 2014 and 2016 China Longitudinal Aging Social Survey (CLASS), a combination of ordinary least squares, ordered logit regression models, and propensity score matching (PSM) models were used to analyze the effects of Internet use on the mental health of Chinese older adults. Results: Our findings suggest that Internet use affects the mental health of older adults and increases the incidence of their depressive symptoms. These findings are robust to changing the key indicators, research method, and sample. Further heterogeneity analysis reveals that the negative effects on mental health are more evident for specific groups of older adults, such as those who are women, younger and middle-aged, high-income, non-rural Hukou, less educated, and living with others. Conclusions: Cultivating the ability of older adults to use the Internet and maintain a rational attitude while doing so can prevent its negative impact on their life satisfaction. Moreover, it can improve their attitudes toward using the technology and reduce their anxiety.","Xie, Lin; Yang, Hua-lei; Lin, Xue-yu; Ti, Shi-ming; Wu, Yuan-yang; Zhang, Shuo; Zhang, Si-qing; Zhou, Wan-li",Front Public Health,231,5

BACKGROUND: Cardiac rehabilitation (CR) education and exercise are predominantly delivered in group face-to-face settings. This delivery model was challenged during the COVID-19 pandemic due to government enforced lockdowns which restricted the delivery of these models of care. The Australian state of Victoria experienced the longest and most severe local restrictions and was in lockdown for approximately 26 weeks of 2020. PURPOSE: We aimed to explore the experience, barriers and enablers of delivering CR during a pandemic, and identify strategies for future COVID-safe programs among cardiac rehabilitation clinicians. METHODS: Victorian members of the Australian Cardiovascular Health and Rehabilitation Association (ACRA) were invited to attend an exploratory qualitative online focus group in November 2020. An inductive thematic analysis was undertaken before deductively applying the Non-adoption, Abandonment, Scale-up, Spread and Sustainability (NASSS) framework to identify barriers and enablers for technology adoption in CR. RESULTS: 30 members participated in a 106 minute focus group. 17 members who provided demographics represented multiple disciplines (nursing n = 13, exercise physiology n = 3, physiotherapy n = 1) and geographical settings (metropolitan n = 10, regional n = 4, rural n = 3). Four main themes were identified: Consequences of sudden service delivery change; Technology use – challenges and benefits; Capacity (program and staff); and The way forward. The deductive NASSS analysis demonstrated the main challenges of continuing remotely delivered CR lie with all adopters (staff, patients, carers) and with organisations. Future CR strategies included the importance of resuming face-to-face programs but important barriers including finding capacity, particularly staffing, to run concurrent telehealth programs remain to be addressed. CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemic forced and expedited significant changes to CR delivery models. While clinicians agreed that delivery of CR via telehealth will continue, it is now timely to review remote models of care and plan how they will integrate alongside traditional face-to-face programs.","Cartledge, S; Rawstorn, J; Tran, M; Ryan, P; Howden, E; Jackson, A",Eur J Cardiovasc Nurs,231,1

Investigation on molecular responses of different herbal strategies against viral myocarditis is immeasurably conducive to targeting drug development in the current international absence of miracle treatment. METHODS: Literature retrieval platforms were applied in the collection of existing empirical evidences for viral myocarditis-related single-herbal strategies. SwissTargetPrediction, Metascape, and Discovery Studio coordinating with multidatabases investigated underlying target genes, interactive proteins, and docking molecules in turn. RESULTS: Six single-herbal medicines consisting of Huangqi (Hedysarum Multijugum Maxim), Yuganzi (Phyllanthi Fructus), Kushen (Sophorae Flavescentis Radix), Jianghuang (Curcumaelongae Rhizoma), Chaihu (Radix Bupleuri), and Jixueteng (Spatholobus Suberectus Dunn) meet the requirement. There were 11 overlapped and 73 unique natural components detected in these herbs. SLC6A2, SLC6A4, NOS2, PPARA, PPARG, ACHE, CYP2C19, CYP51A1, and CHRM2 were equally targeted by six herbs and identified as viral myocarditis-associated symbols. MCODE algorithm exposed the hub role of SRC and EGFR in strategies without Jianghuang. Subsequently, we learned intermolecular interactions of herbal components and their targeting heart-tissue-specific CHRM2, FABP3, TNNC1, TNNI3, TNNT2, and SCN5A and cardiac-myocytes-specific IL6, MMP1, and PLAT coupled with viral myocarditis. Ten interactive characteristics such as π-alkyl and van der Waals were modeled in which ARG111, LYS253, ILE114, and VAL11 on cardiac troponin (TNNC1-TNNI3-TNNT2) and ARG208, ASN106, and ALA258 on MMP1 fulfilled potential communicating anchor with ellagic acid, 5α, 9α-dihydroxymatrine, and leachianone g via hydrogen bond and hydrophobic interaction, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The comprehensive outcomes uncover differences and linkages between six herbs against viral myocarditis through component and target analysis, fostering development of drugs.","Cao, Yu; Liu, Yang; Zhang, Tian; Pan, Jing; Lei, Wei; Zhang, Boli",Genet Res (Camb),231,19

Thus, changes in rat populations have consequences for society, especially in densely-populated cities. Following widespread social distancing and lockdown measures to curtail SARS-CoV-2, worldwide media outlets reported increased sightings of rats. To document possible changes in rat populations, we: (i) examined public service requests in the 6 years before, and during, ‘lockdown’ in New York City; (ii) used spatial analyses to identify calls in proximity to food service establishments (FSE); and (iii) surveyed pest-management companies. Over 6 years prior to the pandemic, we found a consistent moderate spatial association (r = 0.35) between FSE and rat-related calls. During the early stages of the pandemic, the association between rat reports and food services did not decrease as would be expected by restaurant closures, but instead modestly increased (r = 0.45). There was a 29.5% decrease in rat reports, overall. However, hotspot analysis showed that new reports were highly localized, yet absent in several industrial areas they were previously observed in, potentially masking a higher proportion of calls in neighborhoods near closed restaurants. Additionally, 37% of pest management companies surveyed reported that, unlike previous years, 50–100% of requests were from new clients and addresses. The finding that hotspots remained nearby dense clusters of restaurants does not support the common narrative that rats moved long distances. Rather, our results are consistent with rats finding nearby alternative food resources. Tracking these dynamics as the COVID-19 pandemic abates will be an important step to identifying how rats respond to society returning to normal activity patterns.","Parsons, Michael H; Richardson, Jonathan L; Kiyokawa, Yasushi; Stryjek, Rafal; Corrigan, Robert M; Deutsch, Michael A; Ootaki, Masato; Tanikawa, Tsutomu; Parsons, Faith E; Munshi-South, Jason",,231,26

Therefore, assessing the stigma, social support, and other determinants of anxiety and depression in PLWHA are important for developing further interventions. Methods: An institution-based cross-sectional study was conducted in 505 PLWHA, approached through systematic sampling, who paid routine visits to the ART center, Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences (PIMS), Islamabad. Data was collected by pretested validated hospital anxiety and depression scale (HADS). Version 26 of the SPSS was used to apply Logistic regression analysis to identify determinants, and the 95% confidence interval (CI) adjusted odds ratio (AOR) was calculated to assess the magnitude of the relationships. Results: In PLWHA, the prevalence of co-morbid depression and anxiety was 80%. Separately, 89.9% had depression, and 80.3% had anxiety. Use of illicit drugs [AOR = 1.87, 95% CI (1.01, 3.27)], low social support [AOR = 1.21, 95% CI (1.02, 2.25)], being male [AOR = 2.21, 95% CI (1.11, 5.49)], and HIV related stigma [AOR = 2.48, 95% CI (1.25, 6.02)] were significant predictors of depression.

The review considers E/HF perspectives on how the nature of work is changing and what this means for the practice of E/HF and for human performance and wellbeing at work. This field of research has attracted much attention from scholars from various disciplines as flexible working arrangements and casualised employment, in particular, have come under the microscope during the COVID-19 pandemic. The paper begins by setting out the future of work field, focusing on the mega trends and future of work forces that are most relevant to the discipline. Next, E/HF contributions to this field are identified and discussed. Surprisingly, given the E/HF tradition as a systems discipline fundamentally concerned with the study of human work, and as a contributor to transdisciplinary research related to the design of work systems, a search of the scholarly literature found few contributions outside of the automation systems field that addressed the future of work and E/HF directly. A research agenda is presented to address gaps in current knowledge in a number of key future of work domains. Practitioners summary: We reflect on E/HF contributions to the 'future of work' field and how the practice of E/HF needs to consider the changing nature of work.

Out of the 260 veterans screened, 85 veterans (32.7%) reported gambling behaviors within the past 12 months. No significant differences were found between gambling and non-gambling veterans on demographics, medical, or mental health conditions collected in the study. Among veteran past-year gamblers, five veterans (5.9%) screened positive for at-risk/problem gambling. The estimated prevalence of problem gambling was 1.9% among veterans screened in a primary care behavioral health clinic. Results suggest that self-disclosure of problem gambling among veterans, as well as outreach efforts by VA health care providers, could serve to increase veterans' participation in treatment services for problem gambling. Larger, well-powered studies that examine the utility of the BBGS for detecting problem gambling among military populations are needed.","Kraus, Shane W; Potenza, Marc N; Ngo, Tu; Pugh, Kendra; Bernice, Katarina; Shirk, Steven D",Issues in mental health nursing,231,5

Concerns arise as to whether glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficient subjects (G6PD(-)), ~5% of the population in the Mediterranean area, should be accepted as routine donors in the light of the increased oxidative stress their RBCs suffer from. To address this question, we first performed morphology (scanning electron microscopy), physiology and omics (proteomics and metabolomics) analyses on stored RBCs from healthy or G6PD(-) donors. We then used an in vitro model of transfusion to simulate transfusion outcomes involving G6PD(-) donors or recipients, by reconstituting G6PD(-) stored or fresh blood with fresh or stored blood from healthy volunteers, respectively, at body temperature. We found that G6PD(-) cells store well in relation to energy, calcium and morphology related parameters, though at the expenses of a compromised anti-oxidant system. Additional stimuli, mimicking post-transfusion conditions (37°C, reconstitution with fresh healthy blood, incubation with oxidants) promoted hemolysis and oxidative lesions in stored G6PD(-) cells in comparison to controls. On the other hand, stored healthy RBC units showed better oxidative parameters and lower removal signaling when reconstituted with G6PD(-) fresh blood compared to control. Although the measured parameters of stored RBCs from the G6PD deficient donors appeared to be acceptable, the results from the in vitro model of transfusion suggest that G6PD(-) RBCs could be more susceptible to hemolysis and oxidative stresses post-transfusion. On the other hand, their chronic exposure to oxidative stress might make them good recipients, as they better tolerate exposure to oxidatively damaged long stored healthy RBCs.","Tzounakas, Vassilis L; Kriebardis, Anastasios G; Georgatzakou, Hara T; Foudoulaki-Paparizos, Leontini E; Dzieciatkowska, Monika; Wither, Matthew J; Nemkov, Travis; Hansen, Kirk C; Papassideri, Issidora S; D'Alessandro, Angelo; Antonelou, Marianna H",Free radical biology & medicine,231,19

The placental vulnerability is pronounced before embryonic day 11, when even mild immune challenge results in fetal loss. As gestation progresses, the placenta becomes increasingly resilient to maternal inflammation, but there is a narrow window in gestation when the placenta is still vulnerable to immune challenge yet resistant enough to allow for fetal survival. This gestational window correlates with early cortical neurogenesis in the fetal brain. Here, we show that maternal illness during this period selectively alters the abundance and laminar positioning of neuronal subtypes influenced by the Tbr1, Satb2, and Ctip2/Fezf2 patterning axis. The disturbances also lead to a laminar imbalance in the proportions of projection neurons and interneurons in the adult and are sufficient to cause changes in social behavior and cognition. These data illustrate how the timing of an illness-related placental vulnerability causes developmental alterations in neuroanatomical systems and behaviors that are relevant to autism spectrum disorders.","Carpentier, Pamela A; Haditsch, Ursula; Braun, Amy E; Cantu, Andrea V; Moon, Hyang Mi; Price, Robin O; Anderson, Matthew P; Saravanapandian, Vidya; Ismail, Khadija; Rivera, Moises; Weimann, James M; Palmer, Theo D",The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience,231,7

It is considered to be less stable in the environment and its degradation products may have toxicological consequences due to longer persistence and off-site movements. We studied the persistence behavior and leaching potential of tembotrione and its major metabolite TCMBA in clay loam and sandy loam soils having different physico-chemical properties. The rapid transformation of parent tembotrione to degradation products and their high interactions with soil provided challenging task of residues separation from complex soil matrix. Therefore, a novel sample preparation method (modified QuEChERS) was optimized for trace estimation of tembotrione and TCMBA which offered 86.6-95.6% recoveries with limit of detection (LOD) and quantification (LOQ) as 0.001 and 0.003 μg/g, respectively in both soils without any matrix interference. A first order dissipation kinetics was followed by tembotrione and TCMBA residues with half-life ranged from 7.2 to 13.4 days in both soils. Residues reached below detectable limit on 45-60 days after treatments in two application doses. Leaching experiment revealed maximum retention of tembotrione residues from 15 to 25 cm depth in both soils whereas TCMBA show appreciable leaching potential. It was concluded that tembotrione can be phytotoxic to the succeeding crops if applied at late post-emergence stage. TCMBA can contaminate surface and ground water due to continuous and prolonged use of tembotrione particularly in light textured soils.","Rani, Naincy; Duhan, Anil; Tomar, Dinesh",Ecotoxicology and environmental safety,231,1
61558,61558,61558,Introduction to the special section on interventional abdominal radiology.,14.405914,6.9990096,2016,"Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) is an essential immunomodulatory lipid released by cells in response to infection with many bacteria, yet its function in macrophage-mediated bacterial clearance is poorly understood. Yersinia overall inhibits the inflammatory circuit, but its effect on PGE2 production is unknown. We hypothesized that one of the Yersinia effector proteins is responsible for the inhibition of PGE2 biosynthesis. We identified that yopB-deficient Y. enterocolitica and Y. pseudotuberculosis deficient in the secretion of virulence proteins via a type 3 secretion system (T3SS) failed to inhibit PGE2 biosynthesis in macrophages. Consistently, COX-2-mediated PGE2 biosynthesis is upregulated in cells treated with heat-killed or T3SS-deficient Y. pseudotuberculosis but diminished in the presence of a MAPK/ERK inhibitor. Mutants expressing catalytically inactive YopJ induce similar levels of PGE2 as heat-killed or ΔyopB Y. pseudotuberculosis, reversed by YopJ complementation. Shotgun proteomics discovered host pathways regulated in a YopJ-mediated manner, including pathways regulating PGE2 synthesis and oxidative phosphorylation. Consequently, this study identified that YopJ-mediated inhibition of MAPK signal transduction serves as a mechanism targeting PGE2, an alternative means of inflammasome inhibition by Yersinia. Finally, we showed that EP4 signaling supports macrophage function in clearing intracellular bacteria. In summary, our unique contribution was to determine a bacterial virulence factor that targets COX-2 transcription, thereby enhancing the intracellular survival of yersiniae. Future studies should investigate whether PGE2 or its stable synthetic derivatives could serve as a potential therapeutic molecule to improve the outcomes of specific bacterial infections. Since other pathogens encode YopJ homologs, this mechanism is expected to be present in other infections. IMPORTANCE PGE2 is a critical immunomodulatory lipid, but its role in bacterial infection and pathogen clearance is poorly understood. We previously demonstrated that PGE2 leads to macrophage polarization toward the M1 phenotype and stimulates inflammasome activation in infected macrophages. Finally, we also discovered that PGE2 improved the clearance of Y. enterocolitica. The fact that Y. enterocolitica hampers PGE2 secretion in a type 3 secretion system (T3SS)-dependent manner and because PGE2 appears to assist macrophage in the clearance of this bacterium indicates that targeting of the eicosanoid pathway by Yersinia might be an adaption used to counteract host defenses. Our study identified a mechanism used by Yersinia that obstructs PGE2 biosynthesis in human macrophages. We showed that Y. pseudotuberculosis interferes with PGE2 biosynthesis by using one of its T3SS effectors, YopJ. Specifically, YopJ targets the host COX-2 enzyme responsible for PGE2 biosynthesis, which happens in a MAPK/ER-dependent manner. Moreover, in a shotgun proteomics study, we also discovered other pathways that catalytically active YopJ targets in the infected macrophages. YopJ was revealed to play a role in limiting host LPS responses, including repression of EGR1 and JUN proteins, which control transcriptional activation of proinflammatory cytokine production such as interleukin-1β. Since YopJ has homologs in other bacterial species, there are likely other pathogens that target and inhibit PGE2 biosynthesis. In summary, our study's unique contribution was to determine a bacterial virulence factor that targets COX-2 transcription. Future studies should investigate whether PGE2 or its stable synthetic derivatives could serve as a potential therapeutic target.","Sheppe, Austin E F; Santelices, John; Czyz, Daniel M; Edelmann, Mariola J",Microbiology spectrum,231,1

Determining whether recommendation strength is consistent with supporting quality of evidence is also essential. We aimed to determine quality of critical care pharmacotherapy CPGs and to assess whether high quality evidence supports strong pharmacotherapy recommendations. METHODS MEDLINE (1966-February 2008), EMBASE (1980-February 2008), National Guideline Clearinghouse (February 2008) and personal files were searched to identify CPGs. Four appraisers evaluated each guideline using the appraisal of guidelines, research and evaluation (AGREE) instrument. AGREE assesses 23 items in six domains that include scope/purpose, stakeholder involvement, rigor of development, clarity, applicability and editorial independence. Standardized domain scores (0-100%) were determined to decide whether to recommend a guideline for use. One appraiser extracted strong pharmacotherapy recommendations and supporting evidence quality. RESULTS Twenty-four CPGs were included. Standardized domain scores were clarity [69% (95% confidence interval (CI) 62-76%)], scope/purpose [62% (95% CI 55-68%)], rigor of development [51% (95% CI 42-60%)], editorial independence [39% (95% CI 26-52%)], stakeholder involvement [32% (95% CI 26-37%)] and applicability [19% (95% CI 12-26%)]. The proportion of guidelines that could be strongly recommended, recommended with alterations and not recommended was 25, 37.5 and 37.5%, respectively. High quality evidence supported 36% of strong pharmacotherapy recommendations. CONCLUSION Variation in AGREE domain scores explain why one-third of critical care pharmacotherapy CPGs cannot be recommended. Only one-third of strong pharmacotherapy recommendations were supported by high quality evidence. We recommend appraisal of guideline quality and the caliber of supporting evidence prior to applying recommendations.","Gorman, Sean K; Chung, Michelle Ho; Slavik, Richard S; Zed, Peter J; Wilbur, Kerry; Dhingra, Vinay K",Intensive care medicine,231,16

We assessed the relative benefit of adding pembrolizumab to chemotherapy with or without bevacizumab. METHODS In a double-blind, phase 3 trial, we randomly assigned patients with persistent, recurrent, or metastatic cervical cancer in a 1:1 ratio to receive pembrolizumab (200 mg) or placebo every 3 weeks for up to 35 cycles plus platinum-based chemotherapy and, per investigator discretion, bevacizumab. The dual primary end points were progression-free survival and overall survival, each tested sequentially in patients with a PD-L1 combined positive score of 1 or more, in the intention-to-treat population, and in patients with a PD-L1 combined positive score of 10 or more. The combined positive score is defined as the number of PD-L1-staining cells divided by the total number of viable tumor cells, multiplied by 100. All results are from the protocol-specified first interim analysis. RESULTS In 548 patients with a PD-L1 combined positive score of 1 or more, median progression-free survival was 10.4 months in the pembrolizumab group and 8.2 months in the placebo group (hazard ratio for disease progression or death, 0.62; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.50 to 0.77; P<0.001). In 617 patients in the intention-to-treat population, progression-free survival was 10.4 months and 8.2 months, respectively (hazard ratio, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.53 to 0.79; P<0.001). In 317 patients with a PD-L1 combined positive score of 10 or more, progression-free survival was 10.4 months and 8.1 months, respectively (hazard ratio, 0.58; 95% CI, 0.44 to 0.77; P<0.001). Overall survival at 24 months was 53.0% in the pembrolizumab group and 41.7% in the placebo group (hazard ratio for death, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.50 to 0.81; P<0.001), 50.4% and 40.4% (hazard ratio, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.54 to 0.84; P<0.001), and 54.4% and 44.6% (hazard ratio, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.44 to 0.84; P = 0.001), respectively. The most common grade 3 to 5 adverse events were anemia (30.3% in the pembrolizumab group and 26.9% in the placebo group) and neutropenia (12.4% and 9.7%, respectively).

PVS can be hard to distinguish from a state of minimal preserved consciousness (""minimally conscious state,"" MCS); the rate of misdiagnosis is high and has been estimated at 37-43%. In contrast, PVS is easily distinguished from brain death. We discuss the various diagnostic techniques that can be used to determine whether a patient is minimally conscious or in a persistent vegetative state. METHODS This article is based on a systematic review of pertinent literature and on a quantitative meta-analysis of the sensitivity and specificity of new diagnostic methods for the minimally conscious state. RESULTS We identified and evaluated 20 clinical studies involving a total of 906 patients with either PVS or MCS. The reported sensitivities and specificities of the various techniques used to diagnose MCS vary widely. The sensitivity and specificity of functional MRI-based techniques are 44% and 67%, respectively (with corresponding 95% confidence intervals of 19%-72% and 55%-77%); those of quantitative EEG are 90% and 80%, respectively (95% CI, 69%-97% and 66%-90%). EEG, event-related potentials, and imaging studies can also aid in prognostication. Contrary to prior assumptions, 10% to 24% of patients in PVS can regain consciousness, sometimes years after the event, but only with marked functional impairment. CONCLUSION The basic diagnostic evaluation for differentiating PVS from MCS consists of a standardized clinical examination. In the future, modern diagnostic techniques may help identify patients who are in a subclinical minimally conscious state.","Bender, Andreas; Jox, Ralf J; Grill, Eva; Straube, Andreas; Lulé, Dorothée",Deutsches Arzteblatt international,231,29

The study aims at assessing the performance of the multiplex D-tek COVIDOT 5 IgG assay for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies (N, S1+S2, S1, S2 and RBD). Methods Sensitivity and dynamic trend to seropositivity were evaluated in 218 samples obtained from 46 rRT-PCR confirmed COVID-19 patients. Non-SARS-CoV-2 sera (n=118) collected before the COVID-19 pandemic with a potential cross-reaction to the SARS-CoV-2 immunoassay were included in the specificity analysis. Results A gradual dynamic trend since symptom onset was observed for all IgG antibodies. Sensitivities before day 14 were suboptimal. At ≥21 days, sensitivities reached 100% (93.4-100%) for N, S1+S2, S2 and RBD-directed IgG and 96.3% (87.3-99.6%) for S1-directed IgG. In 42 out of 46 patients (91.3%), all five antibodies were detected at ≥14 days. The four remaining patients had between 2 and 4 positive antibodies at their respective maximal follow-up period. The specificity was 100 % for S1+S2, S2 and RBD, 98.3% for N and 92.4% (86.0-96.5%) for S1-directed IgG. The combined use of antigens increases the early sensitivity whilst enforcing high specificity. Conclusions Sensitivities at ≥21 days and specificities were excellent, especially for N, S1+S2, S2 and RBD-directed IgG. Caution is however required when interpreting single S1-directed reactivities. Using a multiplex assay complies with the orthogonal testing algorithm of the CDC and allows a better and critical interpretation of the serological status of a patient.","Favresse, Julien; Brauner, Jonathan; Bodart, Nicolas; Vigneron, Alain; Roisin, Sandrine; Melchionda, Sabrina; Douxfils, Jonathan; Ocmant, Annick",Clinical chemistry and laboratory medicine,231,11
63783,63783,63783,Radiolabelled polymeric IgA: from biodistribution to a new molecular imaging tool in colorectal cancer lung metastases.,14.269121,7.157704,2017,"BACKGROUND Robotic technology is increasingly prevalent in bariatric surgery, yet there are national deficiencies in exposure of surgical residents to robotic techniques. OBJECTIVES The purpose of this study is to accurately characterize the perioperative outcomes of a resident teaching model using the robotic-assisted sleeve gastrectomy. SETTING University Hospital. METHODS We identified 411 consecutive patients who underwent robotic sleeve gastrectomy at our institution from a prospectively maintained administrative database. Perioperative morbidity, operative time, and supply cost of the procedure were analyzed. RESULTS Mean operative time was 96.4±24.9 minutes; mean robot usage time was 63.9 minutes (range 30.0-122.0 min). Ninety-day morbidities included reoperation (0.72%), major bleeding complications (0.48%), staple line leak (0.24%), stricture (0.97%), need for blood transfusion (3.86%), surgical site infection (1.69%), deep vein thrombosis (0.48%), and pulmonary embolism (0.48%). Mortality was nil. The resident cohort achieved operative time plateaus after five consecutive cases. Subset analysis for fiscal year 2014 demonstrated significantly increased supply cost for robotic sleeve gastrectomy compared with its laparoscopic equivalent. CONCLUSION Robotic-assisted sleeve gastrectomy can be instituted as a model for resident robotic education with rates of morbidity and operative times equivalent to historical laparoscopic controls. The robot's enhanced ergonomics and its opportunity for resident education must be weighed against its increased supply cost.","Ecker, Brett L; Maduka, Richard; Ramdon, Andre; Dempsey, Daniel T; Dumon, Kristoffel R; Williams, Noel N",Surgery for obesity and related diseases : official journal of the American Society for Bariatric Surgery,231,1

However, few studies have investigated metabolic imaging features derived from pre-radiotherapy 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron-emission tomography (PET) of metastatic hilar/mediastinal lymph nodes (LNs). We hypothesized that these would provide complementary prognostic information to FDG-PET descriptors to only the primary tumor (tumor). METHODS Two independent cohorts of 262 and 50 node-positive NSCLC patients were used for model development and validation. Image features (i.e. Radiomics) including shape and size, first order statistics, texture, and intensity-volume histograms (IVH) (http://www.radiomics.io/) were evaluated by univariable Cox regression on the development cohort. Prognostic modeling was conducted with a 10-fold cross-validated least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO), automatically selecting amongst FDG-PET-Radiomics descriptors from (1) tumor, (2) LNs or (3) both structures. Performance was assessed with the concordance-index. Development data are publicly available at www.cancerdata.org and Dryad (doi:10.5061/dryad.752153b). RESULTS Common SUV descriptors (maximum, peak, and mean) were significantly related to overall survival when extracted from LNs, as were LN volume and tumor load (summed tumor and LNs' volumes), though this was not true for either SUV metrics or tumor's volume. Feature selection exclusively from imaging information based on FDG-PET-Radiomics, exhibited performances of (1) 0.53 -external 0.54, when derived from the tumor, (2) 0.62 -external 0.56 from LNs, and (3) 0.62 -external 0.59 from both structures, including at least one feature from each sub-category, except IVH. CONCLUSION Combining imaging information based on FDG-PET-Radiomics features from tumors and LNs is desirable to achieve a higher prognostic discriminative power for NSCLC.","Carvalho, Sara; Leijenaar, Ralph T H; Troost, Esther G C; van Timmeren, Janna E; Oberije, Cary; van Elmpt, Wouter; de Geus-Oei, Lioe-Fee; Bussink, Johan; Lambin, Philippe",PloS one,231,33

AVM compartments supplied by leptomeningeal networks and feeding arteries too small and/or tortuous for safe catheterization are rarely penetrated by liquid occlusive agents. A case with both impediments prompted a novel solution. A balloon was inflated across the supply to a lenticulostriate feeder, thereby favoring penetration of the liquid occlusive agent, injected from a different feeding territory, back into the AVM compartment supplied by the temporarily occluded feeder. This technique may reduce the number of embolization stages in large high-flow AVMs and increase the likelihood of achieving complete occlusion. This technique is highly complex and requires meticulous monitoring of multiple events.","Bank, William O; Stemer, Andrew B; Armonda, Rocco A; Bell, Randy S",BMJ case reports,231,32

PCS is associated with a variety of symptoms such as headaches, concentration deficits, fatigue, depression and anxiety that have an enormous impact on patients' lives. There is currently no diagnostic biomarker for PCS. There have been attempts at identifying structural and functional brain changes in patients with PCS, using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and functional MRI (fMRI), respectively, and relate them to specific PCS symptoms. In this scoping review, we appraised, synthesised and summarised all empirical studies that (1) investigated structural or functional brain changes in PCS using DTI or fMRI, respectively, and (2) assessed behavioural alterations in patients with PCS. We performed a literature search in MEDLINE (Ovid), Embase (Ovid) and PsycINFO (Ovid) for primary research articles published up to February 2020. We identified 8306 articles and included 45 articles that investigated the relationship between DTI and fMRI parameters and behavioural changes in patients with PCS: 20 diffusion, 20 fMRI studies and 5 papers with both modalities. Most frequently studied structures were the corpus callosum, superior longitudinal fasciculus in diffusion and the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and default mode network in the fMRI literature. Although some white matter and fMRI changes were correlated with cognitive or neuropsychiatric symptoms, there were no consistent, converging findings on the relationship between neuroimaging abnormalities and behavioural changes which could be largely due to the complex and heterogeneous presentation of PCS. Furthermore, the heterogeneity of symptoms in PCS may preclude discovery of one biomarker for all patients. Further research should take advantage of multimodal neuroimaging to better understand the brain-behaviour relationship, with a focus on individual differences rather than on group comparisons.","Gumus, Melisa; Santos, Alexandra; Tartaglia, Maria Carmela","Journal of neurology, neurosurgery, and psychiatry",231,14

What's known on the subject? and What does the study add? Until now, the transvaginal approach has been the only method of removing larger specimens from the abdominal cavity using natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery. There has been no means of extracting larger specimens in men and the means are restricted even in women, particularly in young women. The present study shows that the difficulty of large specimen retrieval can be overcome, irrespective of the diameter of the chosen port, through natural orifices using morcellation. OBJECTIVE To show, in a porcine model, the feasibility of a complete transvesical natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery (NOTES) nephrectomy with kidney extraction after morcellation through the same port. MATERIALS AND METHODS Transvesical nephrectomy and morcellation were performed in six pigs at Minho University, Braga, Portugal after institutional review board approval. The transvesical port and the cystotomy were created under the guidance of a ureteroscope, while the remaining steps were done under the guidance of an operating telescope. Dissection of the renal vessels and kidney was performed using dissection grasping forceps and a vessel sealing system (LigaSure(™) ; Covidien, Mansfield, MA, USA) and morcellation was done using a Piranha(™) morcellator (Richard Wolf, Knittlingen, Germany). RESULTS There were no complications related to the creation of transvesical access. The image provided by the telescope was superior to that of the ureteroscope, especially underwater. Morcellation was quick and effective, with the support of a fixing needle through the abdominal wall, designed to fix the kidney, after laceration of a bowel loop occurred in the first experiment. It was found that technical improvements are needed to ensure safety of NOTES morcellation. CONCLUSIONS Kidney morcellation after nephrectomy, using a natural orifice exclusively, is feasible. Despite technical limitations, this proof of concept study can be regarded as a potential step towards the application of NOTES in urology.","Lima, Estevao; Branco, Frederico; Parente, Joana; Autorino, Riccardo; Correia-Pinto, Jorge",BJU international,231,1

During April 2020, ExoFlo was provided to 24 SARS-CoV-2 PCR positive patients at a single hospital center, all of whom met criteria for severe COVID-19 as well as moderate to severe Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). Patients received a single 15 mL intravenous dose of ExoFlo and were evaluated for both safety and efficacy day 1-14 post-treatment. All safety endpoints were met with no adverse events observed within 72 hours of ExoFlo administration. A survival rate of 83% was observed. 17/24 (71%) of the patients recovered; 3/24 (13%) remained critically ill though stable; 4/24 (16%) expired for reasons unrelated to the treatment. Overall, after one treatment, patients' clinical status and oxygenation improved with an average PaO2/FiO2 ratio increase of 192% (p < 0.001). Laboratory values revealed significant improvements in absolute neutrophil count [mean reduction 32% [(p-value < 0.001)] and lymphopenia with average CD3+, CD4+ and CD8+ lymphocyte counts increasing by 46% (p < 0.05), 45% (p < 0.05), and 46% (p < 0.001), respectively. Likewise, acute phase reactants declined, with mean C-reactive protein (CRP), Ferritin, and D-dimer reduction of 77% (p < .001), 43% (p < .001), 42% (p <0.05), respectively. In conclusion, due to its safety profile, capacity to restore oxygenation, downregulate cytokine storm, and reconstitute immunity, ExoFlo is a promising therapeutic candidate for severe COVID-19. Future RCTs are needed to determine ExoFlo therapeutic potential.","Sengupta, Vikram; Sengupta, Sascha; Lazo, Angel; Woods, Peter; Nolan, Anna; Bremer, Nicholas",Stem cells and development,231,19

OBJECTIVES Evaluate patient satisfaction with spine care delivered via telemedicine. Identify patient- and visit-based factors associated with increased satisfaction and visit preference. METHODS Telemedicine visits with a spine surgeon at 2 practices in the United States between March and May 2020 were eligible for inclusion in the study. Patients were sent an electronic survey recording overall satisfaction, technical or clinical issues encountered, and preference for a telemedicine versus an in-person visit. Factors associated with poor satisfaction and preference of telemedicine over an in-person visit were identified using multivariate logistic regression. RESULTS A total of 772 responses were collected. Overall, 87.7% of patients were satisfied with their telemedicine visit and 45% indicated a preference for a telemedicine visit over an in-person visit if given the option. Patients with technical or clinical issues were significantly less likely to achieve 5 out of 5 satisfaction scores and were significantly more likely to prefer an in-person visit. Patients who live less than 5 miles from their surgeon's office and patients older than 60 years were also significantly more likely to prefer in-person visits. CONCLUSIONS Spine telemedicine visits during the COVID-19 pandemic were associated with high patient satisfaction. Additionally, 45% of respondents indicated a preference for telemedicine versus an in-patient visit in the future. In light of these findings, telemedicine for spine care may be a preferable option for a subset of patients into the future.","Satin, Alexander M; Shenoy, Kartik; Sheha, Evan D; Basques, Bryce; Schroeder, Gregory D; Vaccaro, Alexander R; Lieberman, Isador H; Guyer, Richard D; Derman, Peter B",Global spine journal,231,16

The role of diet in IBD etiopathogenesis, disease control and symptom management remains incompletely understood. Few studies have collected data on the dietary habits of immigrant populations living with IBD. Our aim was to describe the dietary practices and beliefs of British South Asians with IBD. Methods A 30-item questionnaire was developed and consecutively administered to 255 British South Asians with IBD attending gastroenterology clinics in the United Kingdom. Results Fifty-one percent of participants believed diet was the initiating factor for their IBD and 63% felt diet had previously triggered disease relapse. Eighty-nine percent avoided certain dietary items in the belief that this would prevent relapse. The most commonly avoided foods and drinks were spicy and fatty foods, carbonated drinks, milk products, alcohol, coffee, and red meat. A third of patients had tried a whole food exclusion diet, most commonly lactose- or gluten-free, and this was most frequently reported amongst those with clinically active IBD (P= 0.02). Almost 60% of participants avoided eating the same menu as their family, or eating out, at least sometimes, to prevent IBD relapse. Conclusions British South Asians with IBD demonstrate significant dietary beliefs and food avoidance behaviors with increased frequency compared to those reported in Caucasian IBD populations. Studies in immigrant populations may offer valuable insights into the interaction between diet, Westernization and cultural drift in IBD pathogenesis and symptomatology.","Crooks, Benjamin; Misra, Ravi; Arebi, Naila; Kok, Klaartje; Brookes, Matthew J; McLaughlin, John; Limdi, Jimmy K",Intestinal research,231,17

METHODS This cross-sectional study included 957 (mean age [standard deviation] = 80.8 [4.8] years; 53.5% females) community-dwelling older adults aged ≥ 65 years from a semi-urban area of Japan, who completed a mailed questionnaire. Based on the depressive symptom status assessed with the Two-Question Screen between March and October 2020, participants were classified into four groups: ""non-depressive symptoms,"" ""incidence of depressive symptoms,"" ""remission from depressive symptoms,"" or ""persistence of depressive symptoms."" Participants were assessed in October 2020 for the family caregiving status, caregiving role, the severity of care recipients' needs, and increased caregiver burden during the pandemic, each with the simple question. Multinomial logistic regression analysis was applied to obtain the odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for changes in depressive symptom status. RESULTS Compared to non-caregivers, family caregivers were associated with the incidence (OR [95% CI] = 3.17 [1.55-6.51], p < 0.01) and persistence of depressive symptoms (OR [95% CI] = 2.39 [1.30-4.38], p < 0.01). Primary caregivers, caregivers for individuals with severe care needs, and caregivers with increased burden during the pandemic had a high risk of depressive symptoms. CONCLUSIONS Family caregivers had a high risk of depressive symptoms during the pandemic.

They comprise a large variety of rare and heterogeneous tumors with an estimated incidence of 3-5/100,000/year. They can arise in virtually every internal organ, but mainly occur in the gastroenteropancreatic and bronchopulmonary systems. Around 25% of the NETs are localized in the bronchopulmonary system. Approximately 2% of all lung tumors are NETs. According to the World Health Organization (WHO) classification of lung tumors, bronchopulmonary NETs are subdivided into typical carcinoids (TCs) and atypical carcinoids (ACs). The parameter with the highest impact on NET behavior and prognosis is the histological classification and staging according to the tumor/node/metastasis (TNM) system. The diagnosis of NETs is established by histological examination and the immunohistochemical detection of general neuroendocrine markers, such as chromogranin A (CgA) and synaptophysin. Serum markers and the use of functional imaging techniques are important additive tools to establish the diagnosis of a NET. The only curative option for lung NETs is complete surgical resection. Beyond that, the currently available interdisciplinary therapeutic options are local ablation, biotherapy (somatostatin analogues), or chemotherapy. New therapeutic options such as peptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT) and molecularly targeted therapies achieve promising results and are under further evaluation.

For this purpose, biopsies of human endometrium are obtained from donor women ongoing oocyte donation. Human endometrial fragments are cultured in the presence of adenoviruses engineered to express cDNA for the reporter fluorescent protein mCherry. Upon visualization, labeled tissues with an optimal rate of fluorescence after infection are subsequently chosen for the implantation in recipient mice. One week prior to the implantation surgery, recipient mice are oophorectomized, and estradiol pellets are placed subcutaneously to sustain the survival and growth of lesions. On the day of surgery mice are anesthetized, and peritoneal cavity accessed through a small (1.5 cm) incision by the linea-alba. Fluorescently labeled implants are tweezed, briefly soaked in glue and attached to the peritoneal layer. Incisions are sutured, and animals left to recover for a couple of days. Fluorescence emitted by endometriotic implants is usually non-invasively monitored every 3 days for 4 weeks with an in vivo imaging system. Variations in the size of endometriotic implants can be estimated in real time by quantification of the mCherry signal and normalization against the initial time-point showing maximal fluorescence intensity. Traditional preclinical rodents of models of endometriosis do not allow non-invasive monitoring of lesion in real time but rather allow evaluation of the effects of drugs assayed at the end point. This protocol allows one to track lesions in real time and is more useful to explore the therapeutic potential of drugs in preclinical models of endometriosis. The main limitation of the model thus generated is that non-invasive monitoring is not possible over long periods of time due to the episomal expression of Ad-virus.","Martinez, Jessica; Bisbal, Viviana; Marin, Nerea; Cano, Antonio; Gómez, Raul",Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE,231,29

Specifically, this evidence review addresses the following clinical questions: (a) Should the following pharmacologic agents be used for prophylaxis of CVS: amitriptyline, topiramate, aprepitant, zonisamide/levetiracetam, or mitochondrial supplements? (b) Should the following pharmacologic agents be used for abortive treatment: triptans or aprepitant? RESULTS We found very low-quality evidence to support the use of the following agents for prophylactic and abortive treatment of CVS: amitriptyline, topiramate, aprepitant, zonisamide/levetiracetam, and mitochondrial supplements. We have moderate certainty of evidence for the use of triptans as abortive therapy. We found limited evidence to support the use of ondansetron and the treatment of co-morbid conditions and complementary therapies. CONCLUSIONS This evidence review helps inform the accompanying guideline for the management of adults with CVS which is aimed at helping clinicians, patients, and policymakers, and should improve patient outcomes.","Sharaf, Ravi N; Venkatesan, Thangam; Shah, Raj; Levinthal, David J; Tarbell, Sally E; Jaradeh, Safwan S; Hasler, William L; Issenman, Robert M; Adams, Kathleen A; Sarosiek, Irene; Stave, Christopher D; Li, B U K; Sultan, Shahnaz",Neurogastroenterology and motility : the official journal of the European Gastrointestinal Motility Society,231,1

Since they selectively target enzyme-substrate complexes (E:S), their inhibitory potency is amplified by increasing substrate concentrations. Recently, an unconventional uncompetitive inhibitor, called CE3F4R, was discovered for the exchange protein activated by cAMP isoform 1 (EPAC1). Unlike conventional uncompetitive inhibitors, CE3F4R is uncompetitive with respect to an allosteric effector, cAMP, as opposed to the substrate (i.e., CE3F4R targets the E:cAMP rather than the E:S complex). However, the mechanism of CE3F4R as an uncompetitive inhibitor is currently unknown. Here, we elucidate the mechanism of CE3F4R's action using NMR spectroscopy. Due to limited solubility and line broadening, which pose major challenges for traditional structural determination approaches, we resorted to a combination of protein- and ligand-based NMR experiments to comparatively analyze EPAC mutations, inhibitor analogs, and cyclic nucleotide derivatives that trap EPAC at different stages of activation. We discovered that CE3F4R binds within the EPAC cAMP-binding domain (CBD) at a subdomain interface distinct from the cAMP binding site, acting as a wedge that stabilizes a cAMP-bound mixed-intermediate. The mixed-intermediate includes attributes of both the apo/inactive and cAMP-bound/active states. In particular, the intermediate targeted by CE3F4R traps a CBD's hinge helix in its inactive conformation, locking EPAC into a closed domain topology that restricts substrate access to the catalytic domain. The proposed mechanism of action also explains the isoform selectivity of CE3F4R in terms of a single EPAC1 versus EPAC2 amino acid difference that destabilizes the active conformation of the hinge helix.","Boulton, Stephen; Selvaratnam, Rajeevan; Blondeau, Jean-Paul; Lezoualc'h, Frank; Melacini, Giuseppe",Journal of the American Chemical Society,231,1

This study is the first to assess its mental health impact across the lifespan in the United States in adolescents, adults, and health care workers. METHODS We recruited 4909 participants through an online survey advertising on Facebook and Instagram to assess exposure to COVID-19 and psychiatric symptoms from April 27 to July 13. We also recruited through the University of Pittsburgh, University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, and other health care systems around Pittsburgh. The primary outcomes were clinically significant depression, anxiety, and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms, suicidal ideation or behavior, and grief reactions since COVID-19. RESULTS Adolescents were significantly more likely to report moderate to severe symptoms of depression (55% vs. 29%; χ2 = 122, df = 1; p < .001), anxiety (48% vs. 29%; χ2 = 73; df = 1; p < .001), PTSD (45% vs. 33%; χ2 = 12; df = 1; p < .001), suicidal ideation or behavior (38% vs. 16%; χ2 = 117; df = 1; p < .001), and sleep problems (69% vs. 57%; χ2 = 26; df = 1; p < .001) compared to adults. The rates of intense grief reactions among those who lost someone to COVID-19 was 55%. Loneliness was the most common predictor across outcomes and higher number of hours spent on social media and exposure to media about COVID-19 predicted depression symptoms and suicidal ideation or behavior in adolescents. CONCLUSIONS The COVID-19 pandemic is associated with increased rates of clinically significant psychiatric symptoms. Loneliness could put individuals at increased risk for the onset of psychiatric disorders.","Murata, Stephen; Rezeppa, Taylor; Thoma, Brian; Marengo, Laura; Krancevich, Katie; Chiyka, Elizabeth; Hayes, Benjamin; Goodfriend, Eli; Deal, Meredith; Zhong, Yongqi; Brummit, Bradley; Coury, Tiffany; Riston, Sarah; Brent, David A; Melhem, Nadine M",Depression and anxiety,231,4

The numbers of registrations are now raising inordinately. It is challenging to understand which research areas are explored in this massive pool of clinical studies. If such information can be compiled, then it is easy to explore new research studies for possible contributions in COVID-19 research. METHODS In the present work, a text-mining technique of artificial intelligence is utilized to map the research domains explored through the clinical trials of COVID-19. With the help of open-source and graphical user interface-based tool, 3007 clinical trials are analyzed here. The dataset is acquired from the international clinical trial registry platform of WHO. With the help of hierarchical cluster analysis, the clinical trials were grouped according to their common research studies. These clusters are analyzed manually using their word clouds for understanding the scientific area of a particular cluster. The scientific fields of clinical studies are comprehensively reviewed and discussed based on this analysis. RESULTS More than three-thousand clinical trial are grouped in 212 clusters by hierarchical cluster analysis. Manual intervention of these clusters using their individual word-cloud, helped to identify various scientific areas which are explored in COVID19 related clinical studies. CONCLUSION The text-mining is an easy and fastest way to explore many registered clinical trials. In our study, thirteen major clusters or research areas were identified in which the majority of clinical trials were registered. Many other uncategorized clinical studies were also identified as 'miscellaneousstudies'. The clinical trials within the individual cluster were studied, and their research purposes are compiled comprehensively in the present work.","Patel, Swayamprakash; Patel, Ashish; Patel, Mruduka; Shah, Umang; Patel, Mehul; Solanki, Nilay; Patel, Suchita",Reviews on recent clinical trials,231,31

This study is aimed at comparing the effectiveness and safety between single-port laparoscopic (SPL) and conventional multiport laparoscopic (CL) surgeries for hepatic left lateral sectionectomy. Methods A total of 65 patients receiving laparoscopic hepatic left lateral sectionectomy between January 2008 and July 2015 were included and divided into the SPL group (n = 40) and the CL group (n = 25). Results There was no significant difference in the operative time, estimated intraoperative blood loss, length of hospital stay, and incidences of postoperative complications (biliary leakage, hemorrhage, and contusion at incision) between groups (all P > 0.05). However, the SPL group had a significantly lower VAS pain score (at 24 h but not 7 days postoperation) and higher cosmetic satisfaction scores (at both 2 months and 6 months postoperation) than the CL group (all P < 0.01). Moreover, multivariate linear regression analysis further confirmed the superior pain score and cosmetic outcome in the SPL group. Conclusions Single-port laparoscopic hepatic left lateral sectionectomy is a safe and feasible treatment for patients with lesions in the left hepatic lobe. Patients with benign lesions in the left hepatic lobe are more suitable to receive single-port laparoscopic hepatic left lateral sectionectomy than those with malignancies.","Cheng, Yuan; Jiang, Ze-Sheng; Xu, Xiao-Ping; Huang, Wen-Fa; He, Guo-Lin; Zhou, Chen-Jie; Qin, Jia-Sheng; Gao, Yi; Pan, Ming-Xin",Gastroenterology research and practice,231,16

Rhesus θ-defensin (RTD)-1 is an antimicrobial peptide with immunomodulatory activity. As airway inflammation and neutrophil recruitment and activation are hallmarks of ALI, we evaluated the therapeutic efficacy of RTD-1 in preclinical models of the disease. We investigated the effect of RTD-1 on neutrophil chemotaxis and macrophage-driven pulmonary inflammation with human peripheral neutrophils and LPS-stimulated murine alveolar macrophage (denoted MH-S) cells. Treatment and prophylactic single escalating doses were administered subcutaneously in a well-established murine model of direct endotoxin-induced ALI. We assessed lung injury by histopathology, pulmonary edema, inflammatory cell recruitment, and inflammatory cytokines/chemokines in the BAL fluid. In vitro studies demonstrated that RTD-1 suppressed CXCL8-induced neutrophil chemotaxis, TNF-mediated neutrophil-endothelial cell adhesion, and proinflammatory cytokine release in activated murine alveolar immortalized macrophages (MH-S) cells. Treatment with RTD-1 significantly inhibited in vivo LPS-induced ALI by reducing pulmonary edema and histopathological changes. Treatment was associated with dose- and time-dependent inhibition of proinflammatory cytokines (TNF, IL-1β, and IL-6), peroxidase activity, and neutrophil recruitment into the airways. Antiinflammatory effects were demonstrated in animals receiving RTD-1 up to 12 hours after LPS challenge. Notably, subcutaneously administered RTD-1 demonstrates good peptide stability as demonstrated by the long in vivo half-life. Taken together, these studies demonstrate that RTD-1 is efficacious in an experimental model of ALI through inhibition of neutrophil chemotaxis and adhesion, and the attenuation of proinflammatory cytokines and gene expression from alveolar macrophages.","Jayne, Jordanna G; Bensman, Timothy J; Schaal, Justin B; Park, A Young J; Kimura, Elza; Tran, Dat; Selsted, Michael E; Beringer, Paul M",American journal of respiratory cell and molecular biology,231,1

The goal of this study is to evaluate the RFID technology within a hospital information system (HIS) for better workflow management in a health promotion center. We developed an RFID (433 mHz) real-time tracking system to monitor patients at the room level. Then we implemented an automatic workflow management by integrating RFID system with HIS. If a patient has finished one examination, the next step is determined automatically by previous number of examined patients and duration in each examination room. We performed interrupted time-series analysis of the mean waiting time for patients in a health promotion center compared with a control group of outpatients in the hospital's radiology department before and after the implementation of an RFID-based system. After implementation of the RFID system, the mean waiting time of patients in the health promotion center decreased significantly (from 5.4 to 4.3 min, 20% decrease) compared with the control group (from 3.8 to 3.5 min, 8% decrease). The RFID system integrated with HIS increases workflow efficiency by shortening the mean waiting time during the workflow process and provides valuable real-time data for physicians and staff regarding workflow efficiency.","Kim, Ju-Young; Lee, Hak-Jong; Byeon, Nam-Soo; Kim, Hyun-Chul; Ha, Kyoo-Seop; Chung, Chin-Youb",IEEE transactions on information technology in biomedicine : a publication of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society,231,16

It is urgent to conduct prediction research on the development and spread of the epidemic. In this article, a hybrid artificial-intelligence (AI) model is proposed for COVID-19 prediction. First, as traditional epidemic models treat all individuals with coronavirus as having the same infection rate, an improved susceptible-infected (ISI) model is proposed to estimate the variety of the infection rates for analyzing the transmission laws and development trend. Second, considering the effects of prevention and control measures and the increase of the public's prevention awareness, the natural language processing (NLP) module and the long short-term memory (LSTM) network are embedded into the ISI model to build the hybrid AI model for COVID-19 prediction. The experimental results on the epidemic data of several typical provinces and cities in China show that individuals with coronavirus have a higher infection rate within the third to eighth days after they were infected, which is more in line with the actual transmission laws of the epidemic. Moreover, compared with the traditional epidemic models, the proposed hybrid AI model can significantly reduce the errors of the prediction results and obtain the mean absolute percentage errors (MAPEs) with 0.52%, 0.38%, 0.05%, and 0.86% for the next six days in Wuhan, Beijing, Shanghai, and countrywide, respectively.","Zheng, Nanning; Du, Shaoyi; Wang, Jianji; Zhang, He; Cui, Wenting; Kang, Zijian; Yang, Tao; Lou, Bin; Chi, Yuting; Long, Hong; Ma, Mei; Yuan, Qi; Zhang, Shupei; Zhang, Dong; Ye, Feng; Xin, Jingmin",IEEE transactions on cybernetics,231,1

After mesh placement in IPOM position, the real extent of the meshes configurational changes after termination of pneumoperitoneum is still largely unknown. To prevent a later mesh folding it might be useful to place the mesh while it is kept under tension. Conventionally used meshes may lose their Effective Porosity under these conditions due to poor elastic properties. The aim of this study was to evaluate a newly developed elastic thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) containing mesh that retains its Effective Porosity under mechanical strain in IPOM position in a porcine model. It was visualized under pneumoperitoneum using MRI in comparison to polyvinylidenefluoride (PVDF) meshes with similar structure. METHODS In each of ten minipigs, a mesh (TPU containing or native PVDF, 10 × 20 cm) was randomly placed in IPOM position at the center of the abdominal wall. After 8 weeks, six pigs underwent MRI evaluation with and without pneumoperitoneum to assess the visibility and elasticity of the mesh. Finally, pigs were euthanized and abdominal walls were explanted for histological and immunohistochemical assessment. The degree of adhesion formation was documented. RESULTS Laparoscopic implantation of elastic TPU meshes in IPOM position was feasible and safe in a minipig model. Mesh position could be precisely visualized and assessed with and without pneumoperitoneum using MRI after 8 weeks. Elastic TPU meshes showed a significantly higher surface increase under pneumoperitoneum in comparison to PVDF. Immunohistochemically, the amount of CD45-positive cells was significantly lower and the Collagen I/III ratio was significantly higher in TPU meshes after 8 weeks. There were no differences regarding adhesion formation between study groups. CONCLUSIONS The TPU mesh preserves its elastic properties in IPOM position in a porcine model after 8 weeks. Immunohistochemistry indicates superior biocompatibility regarding CD45-positive cells and Collagen I/III ratio in comparison to PVDF meshes with a similar structure.","Lambertz, A; van den Hil, L C L; Ciritsis, A; Eickhoff, R; Kraemer, N A; Bouvy, N D; Müllen, A; Klinge, U; Neumann, U P; Klink, C D",Journal of investigative surgery : the official journal of the Academy of Surgical Research,231,1

Nevertheless, no results have been reported on kinship analysis after whole genome amplification (WGA) of single cells. This WGA step is a necessary procedure in several applications, such as cell-based non-invasive prenatal testing (cbNIPT) and pre-implantation genetic diagnosis (PGD). In cbNIPT, all putative fetal cells must be discriminated from maternal cells after enrichment from whole blood. This study investigates the efficacy and evidential value of STR- and SNP-genotyping methods for the discrimination of 24 single cells after WGA, within three families. Formaldehyde-fixed and unfixed cells are assessed in offspring-parent duos and offspring-mother-father trios. Results demonstrate that both genotyping methods can be used in all tested conditions and scenarios with 100% sensitivity and 100% specificity, with a similar evidential value for fixed and unfixed cells. Moreover, sequence-based SNP-genotyping results in a higher evidential value than length-based STR-genotyping after WGA, which is not observed using high-quality offspring bulk DNA samples. Finally, it is also demonstrated that the availability of the DNA genotypes of both parents strongly increases the evidential value of the results.","Weymaere, Jana; Vander Plaetsen, Ann-Sophie; Tilleman, Laurentijn; Tytgat, Olivier; Rubben, Kaat; Geeraert, Sofie; Deforce, Dieter; Van Nieuwerburgh, Filip",Scientific reports,231,31

The increase in Pes swings and esophageal pressure-time product during the spontaneous breathing trial was not significant (P = .33 and P = .75, respectively), and a similar trend was observed with peak EAdi (P = .06). Oxygen consumption obtained by indirect calorimetry was stable in the 3 conditions (P = .98). CONCLUSIONS In these children who were critically ill, a spontaneous breathing trial induced a moderate and nonsignificant increase in work of breathing, as reflected by the respiratory drive with EAdi and respiratory mechanics with Pes. However, indirect calorimetry did not seem to be a sensitive tool to assess respiratory muscle function during the weaning phase in children who were on mechanical ventilation, especially when work of breathing was slightly increased.","Mortamet, Guillaume; Nardi, Nicolas; Groleau, Véronique; Essouri, Sandrine; Fauroux, Brigitte; Jouvet, Philippe; Emeriaud, Guillaume",Respiratory care,231,30

The objective of this systematic review is to identify studies pertaining to antivirals, both as sole and combined therapies, in COVID-19 patients and review the clinical outcomes of these treatment methods. AREAS COVERED A systematic review was conducted using Preferred Reporting Items or Systematic Reviews and Meta-analysis (PRISMA) guidelines. A literature search was done on Medline, Global Health, and EMBASE using keywords and MeSH terms relevant to COVID- 19 and antivirals. Limits were put on date to obtain articles between December 2019 to May 2020 (the time at which the search was performed). 776 articles were identified and screened. After screening, 16 studies were included. The narrative synthesis revealed three key themes (1) Use of antivirals only (such as lopinavir, umifenovir, and remdesivir), (2) Use of lopinavir-ritonavir alongside other treatments and (3) Use of other antivirals in combination with other treatments. EXPERT OPINION Using antivirals in combination with other treatments has potential, however further randomised controlled trials with larger sample sizes are required to identify the best candidate components that should comprise combined treatments for COVID-19. This should optimise treatment efficacy and improve patient outcomes.","Hussain, Nafisa; Yoganathan, Anusha; Hewage, Savini; Alom, Samiha; Harky, Amer",Expert review of anti-infective therapy,231,12

RECENT FINDINGS Several studies have been showing that depth of anaesthesia monitors based on processed electroencephalogram has limitations that can lead to a wrong interpretation of the level of anaesthesia. Processed electroencephalogram indices can be altered by nonanaesthetic influences ranging from artefacts that affect signal quality and signal processing, adverse effects of some anaesthetic and nonanaesthetic drugs, neuromuscular blocking agents to conditions inherent to the patient such as cerebral tumours, brain ischemia and temperature. SUMMARY Clinicians should be aware of the several limitations of the commercial devices intending to monitor the depth of anaesthesia, which may not reflect the real underlying level of unconsciousness.","Lobo, Francisco A; Schraag, Stefan",Current opinion in anaesthesiology,231,19

However, there is currently no imaging model that predicts infarction adjusting for elapsed time between the pathologic snapshot of admission imaging until endovascular recanalization. We trained and cross validated a multivariate generalized linear model (GLM) that uses computer tomography perfusion and clinical data to quantify patient-specific dynamic change of tissue infarction depending on degree and time of recanalization. Multicenter data of 161 patients with proximal anterior circulation occlusion undergoing endovascular therapy were included. Multivariate voxelwise infarct probability was calculated within the GLM. The effect of increasing time to treatment and degree of recanalization on voxelwise infarction was calculated in each patient. Tissue benefit of successful relative to unsuccessful recanalization was shown up to 15 hours after onset in individual patients and decreased nonlinearly with time. On average, the relative reduction of infarct volume at the treatment interval of 5 hours was 53% and this salvage effect decreased by 5% units per hour to <5% after 10 additional hours to treatment. Treatment time-adjusted multivariate prediction of infarction by perfusion and clinical status may identify patients who benefit from extended time to recanalization therapy.","Kemmling, André; Flottmann, Fabian; Forkert, Nils Daniel; Minnerup, Jens; Heindel, Walter; Thomalla, Goetz; Eckert, Bernd; Knauth, Michael; Psychogios, Marios; Langner, Soenke; Fiehler, Jens",Journal of cerebral blood flow and metabolism : official journal of the International Society of Cerebral Blood Flow and Metabolism,231,0

Skin grafts are also frequently used to cover surgical wounds not amenable to linear closure. While all grafts have potential to contract, clinical observation suggests that antecedent thermal injury worsens contraction and impairs functional and aesthetic outcomes. This study evaluates the impact of antecedent full-thickness burn on split-thickness skin graft scar outcomes and the potential mediating factors. Full-thickness contact burns (100°C, 30s) were created on the backs of anesthetized female Yorkshire Pigs. After seven days, burn eschar was tangentially excised and covered with 12/1000th inch (300μm) split-thickness skin graft. For comparison, unburned wounds were created by sharp excision to fat before graft application. From 7 to 120days post-grafting, planimetric measurements, digital imaging and biopsies for histology, immunohistochemistry and gene expression were obtained. At 120days post-grafting, the Observer Scar Assessment Scale, colorimetry, contour analysis and optical graft height assessments were performed. Twenty-nine porcine wounds were analyzed. All measured metrics of clinical skin quality were significantly worse (p<0.05) in burn injured wounds. Histological analysis supported objective clinical findings with marked scar-like collagen proliferation within the dermis, increased vascular density, and prolonged and increased cellular infiltration. Observed differences in contracture also correlated with earlier and more prominent myofibroblast differentiation as demonstrated by α-SMA staining. Antecedent thermal injury worsens split-thickness skin graft quality, likely by multiple mechanisms including burn-related inflammation, microscopically inadequate excision, and dysregulation of tissue remodeling. A valid, reliable, clinically relevant model of full-thickness burn, excision and skin replacement therapy has been demonstrated. Future research to enhance quality of skin replacement therapies should be directed toward modulation of inflammation and assessments for complete excision.","Carlsson, Anders H; Rose, Lloyd F; Fletcher, John L; Wu, Jesse C; Leung, Kai P; Chan, Rodney K",Burns : journal of the International Society for Burn Injuries,231,19

We have introduced a 2-site modified single-incision laparosopic surgery technique for laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (LRYGB). METHODS We used the umbilical site incision to place 2 ports (12 and 10 mm) to serve as the video port and working port for the stapler. Another small skin incision was placed at a left lateral abdominal site for the 5-mm working port. Through these working channels, we could use conventional laparoscopic instruments to perform LRYGB. The data from 100 consecutive 2-site LRYGB procedures (February 2009 to September 2009) were compared with the data from 100 traditional LRYGB procedures (September 2008 to January 2009). RESULTS The mean body mass index for the study group was 43 kg/m(2) (range 32-61), and mean age was 34 years (range 18-55). The procedures were successfully performed in all but 18 patients. These 18 patients had required an extra skin incision for a 5-mm port to complete the procedures. The mean operating time was 144 minutes (range 95-160), and blood loss was 56 mL (range 20-150). A total of 3 perioperative major complications (3%) occurred, and 6 patients (6%) had minor complications. The 2-site LRYGB group had a significantly longer operating time and more blood loss than the traditional LRYGB group but less pain and better cosmesis. CONCLUSION Two-site LRYGB generated minimal somatic pain and achieved excellent cosmetic results. We believe it can be applied as routine LRYGB surgery.","Lee, Wei-Jei; Chen, Jung-Chien; Yao, Wei-Cheng; Taou, Jun-Jin; Lee, Yi-Chih; Ser, Kong-Han",Surgery for obesity and related diseases : official journal of the American Society for Bariatric Surgery,231,1

The objective of this review was to compare the postoperative outcome after pancreatic enucleation versus standard resection. METHODS MEDLINE, Embase and the Cochrane Library were searched systematically until February 2015 to identify studies comparing the outcome of enucleation versus standard resection for pancreatic neoplasms. After critical appraisal, meta-analysis was performed and the findings were presented as odds ratios or weighted mean differences with corresponding 95 per cent c.i. RESULTS Twenty-two observational studies (1148 patients) were included. Duration of surgery (P < 0.001), blood loss (P < 0.001), length of hospital stay (P = 0.04), and postoperative endocrine (P < 0.001) and exocrine (P = 0.01) insufficiency were lower after enucleation than after standard resection. Mortality (P = 0.44), overall complications (P = 0.74), reoperation rate (P = 0.93) and delayed gastric emptying (P = 0.15) were not significantly different between the two approaches. The overall rate of postoperative pancreatic fistula (POPF) was higher after enucleation than after standard resection (P < 0.001). However, the raised POPF rate did not result in higher mortality or overall morbidity. Sensitivity analysis of high-volume studies (total of more than 20 enucleations and more than 4 per year) showed that, in specialized centres, enucleation can be performed with no increased risk of POPF (P = 0.12). CONCLUSION Compared with standard resection, pancreatic enucleation can be performed effectively and with comparable safety in high-volume institutions. Enucleation should be considered instead of standard resection for selected pancreatic neoplasms.","Hüttner, F J; Koessler-Ebs, J; Hackert, T; Ulrich, A; Büchler, M W; Diener, M K",The British journal of surgery,231,1

MATERIALS AND METHODS A retrospective analysis from January 2014 to October 2018 was performed in six patients (4 females and 2 males; mean age, 45.3 ± 14.2 years; range, 26-61 years) who underwent LPA embolization for chylous ascites developing after retroperitoneal surgery involving the perirenal space (four donor nephrectomies, one partial nephrectomy, and one retroperitoneal lymphadenectomy). After placing a percutaneous drainage catheter into the LPA or adjacent lymphocele, embolization was performed by filling the LPA itself with a mixture of glue and Lipiodol (Guerbet). RESULTS Daily drainage from percutaneously placed drains exceeded 300 mL/day despite medical and surgical treatment (volume: mean, 1173 ± 1098 mL; range, 305-2800 mL). Intranodal lymphangiography was performed in four of the six patients and revealed leakage in 2 patients. Percutaneous embolization of the LPA was successful in all patients using an NBCA and Lipiodol mixture in a ratio of 1:1-1:2 (volume: mean, 4.3 ± 1.1 mL; range, 3-6 mL). Chylous ascites was resolved and the drainage catheter was removed in all patients within 4 days after the procedure (mean, 2.0 ± 1.8 days; range, 0-4 days). No procedure-related complications or recurrence of chylous ascites occurred during a mean follow-up period of 37.3 months (range, 21.1-48.4 months). CONCLUSION Glue embolization of LPA has the potential to be a feasible and effective treatment method for the management of chylous ascites after retroperitoneal surgery.","Kwon, Lyo Min; Hur, Saebeom; Jeong, Chang Wook; Jae, Hwan Jun; Chung, Jin Wook",Korean journal of radiology,231,20

The magnetic neutron scattering from the Cr ions exhibits significant changes with temperature and dominates at low momentum transfer regime. Ab initio calculations performed including magnetic interactions show that the effect of magnetic interactions is very significant on the low- as well as high-energy phonon modes. We have also shown that the inelastic neutron spectrum of YCrO3 mimics the magnon spectrum from a G-type antiferromagnetic system, which is consistent with previously reported magnetic structure in the compound. The pressure-dependent ab initio lattice dynamics calculations are used to calculate the anisotropic thermal expansion behaviour in orthorhombic YCrO3, which is in excellent agreement with the available experimental data in the paramagnetic phase. We identify that the low energy anharmonic phonon modes involving Y vibrations contribute maximum to the thermal expansion behaviour.","Gupta, Mayanak K; Mittal, Ranjan; Mishra, Sanjay K; Goel, Prabhatasree; Singh, Baltej; Rols, Stephane; Chaplot, Samrath L",Journal of physics.

These reports spurred a lively public discussion on the possible public-health threats represented by prion-containing aerosols. Here we offer our view on the context in which these findings should be placed. On the one hand, the fact that nebulized prions can transmit disease cannot be taken to signify that prions are airborne under natural circumstances. On the other hand, it appears important to underscore the fact that aerosols can originate very easily in a broad variety of experimental and natural environmental conditions. Aerosols are a virtually unavoidable consequence of the handling of fluids; complete prevention of the generation of aerosols is very difficult. While prions have never been found to be transmissible via aerosols under natural conditions, it appears prudent to strive to minimize exposure to potentially prion-infected aerosols whenever the latter may arise - for example in scientific and diagnostic laboratories handling brain matter, cerebrospinal fluids, and other potentially contaminated materials, as well as abattoirs. Equally important is that prion biosafety training be focused on the control of, and protection from, prion-infected aerosols.","Stitz, Lothar; Aguzzi, Adriano",Prion,231,31

In addition to the direct removal of native vegetation, agricultural expansion often elicits other human-induced disturbances, many of which are poorly addressed by existing environmental legislation and conservation programmes. This is particularly true for tropical freshwater systems, where there is considerable uncertainty about whether a legislative focus on protecting riparian vegetation is sufficient to conserve stream fauna.To assess the extent to which stream fish are being effectively conserved in agricultural landscapes, we examined the spatial distribution of assemblages in river basins to identify the relative importance of human impacts at instream, riparian and catchment scales, in shaping observed patterns. We used an extensive dataset on the ecological condition of 83 low-order streams distributed in three river basins in the eastern Brazilian Amazon.We collected and identified 24,420 individual fish from 134 species. Multiplicative diversity partitioning revealed high levels of compositional dissimilarity (DS) among stream sites (DS = 0.74 to 0.83) and river basins (DS = 0.82), due mainly to turnover (77.8% to 81.8%) rather than nestedness. The highly heterogeneous fish faunas in small Amazonian streams underscore the vital importance of enacting measures to protect forests on private lands outside of public protected areas.Instream habitat features explained more variability in fish assemblages (15%-19%) than riparian (2%-12%), catchment (4%-13%) or natural covariates (4%-11%). Although grouping species into functional guilds allowed us to explain up to 31% of their abundance (i.e. for nektonic herbivores), individual riparian - and catchment - scale predictor variables that are commonly a focus of environmental legislation explained very little of the observed variation (partial R2 values mostly <5%).Policy implications. Current rates of agricultural intensification and mechanization in tropical landscapes are unprecedented, yet the existing legislative frameworks focusing on protecting riparian vegetation seem insufficient to conserve stream environments and their fish assemblages. To safeguard the species-rich freshwater biota of small Amazonian streams, conservation actions must shift towards managing whole basins and drainage networks, as well as agricultural practices in already-cleared land.","Leal, Cecília G; Barlow, Jos; Gardner, Toby A; Hughes, Robert M; Leitão, Rafael P; Nally, Ralph Mac; Kaufmann, Philip R; Ferraz, Silvio F B; Zuanon, Jansen; de Paula, Felipe R; Ferreira, Joice; Thomson, James R; Lennox, Gareth D; Dary, Eurizângela P; Röpke, Cristhiana P; Pompeu, Paulo S",The Journal of applied ecology,231,1

This review aimed to synthesize the remission and recurrence rates following TSS for CD and identify predictors of these outcomes. METHODS Medline (1946-) and Embase (1947-) were searched until 23rd January 2019 for original studies. A meta-analysis was performed of remission and recurrence rates. Studies were excluded if patients had prior radiosurgery/radiotherapy, mixed pathologies or interventions without separated data, follow-up not reported or population size < 20. For recurrence rate syntheses, studies with follow-up < 6 months were excluded. RESULTS The search produced 2663 studies, of which n = 68 were included, involving 5664 patients. Remission rates after primary and revision TSS were 80% [77-82] and 58% [50-66] at last follow-up. After primary TSS, predictors of remission were micro- v macroadenomas (83% v 68%, p < 0.01), imaging-visible adenomas (81% v 69%, p < 0.01), adenomas confirmed on histopathology (87% v 45%, p < 0.01), absence of cavernous sinus invasion (80% v 30%, p < 0.01), postoperative serum cortisol (MSeC) nadir < 2 μg/dL (< 55 nmol/L; 95% v 46%, p < 0.01) and lower preoperative 24-h urine free cortisol (1250 nmol v 1726 nmol, p < 0.01). For revision TSS, predictors of remission were postoperative MSeC nadir < 2 μg/dL (< 55 nmol/L; 100% v 38%, p < 0.01) and operations for recurrence v persistence (80% v 54%, p < 0.01).

The results showed that this recombinant protein was correctly folded, being able to maintain intact conformation and authentic antigenicity. It could induce strong humoral and cellular immune responses and high titers of neutralizing antibodies in the vaccinated mice. RBD219-CHO protein elicited potent protective immunity that protected all vaccinated mice from SARS-CoV challenge.

This study examined the characteristics of postprocedural CMBs and the factors that cause their increase. METHODS The patients who underwent endovascular treatment for unruptured intracranial aneurysms from April 2016 to February 2018 were retrospectively analyzed. Treatment techniques for endovascular treatment included simple coiling, balloon-assisted coiling, stent-assisted coiling, or flow diverter placement. To evaluate the increase in CMBs, a head MRI including diffusion-weighted imaging and T2*-weighted MRIs was performed on the preprocedural day; the first postprocedural day; and at 1, 3, and 6 months after the procedure. RESULTS Among the 101 aneurysms that were analyzed, 38 (37.6%) showed the appearance of new CMBs. In the multivariate analysis examining the causes of the CMB increases, chronic kidney disease, a higher number of preprocedural CMBs, and a higher number of diffusion-weighted imaging-positive lesions on the first postprocedural day were independent risk factors. Furthermore, a greater portion of the increased CMBs was found in cortical and subcortical lesions of the treated vascular perfusion area within 1 month after the procedure. CONCLUSION In endovascular treatment for unruptured intracranial aneurysms, CMBs tended to increase in patients with small vessel disease before the procedure, and it was also implicated in hemorrhagic changes after periprocedural microinfarction.","Higashi, Eiji; Hatano, Taketo; Ando, Mitsushige; Chihara, Hideo; Ogura, Takenori; Suzuki, Keita; Yamagami, Keitaro; Kondo, Daisuke; Kamata, Takahiko; Sakai, Shota; Sakamoto, Hiroki; Nagata, Izumi",Neuroradiology,231,0

These findings are then applied to propose a conceptual framework characterising an EID prepared health system. A narrative synthesis approach was adopted to explore the key elements of LMIC health systems during an EID outbreak. Overarching themes ('core health system constructs') and sub-themes ('elements') relevant to EID preparedness were extracted from 49 peer-reviewed articles. The resulting conceptual framework recognised six core constructs: four focused on material resources and structures (i.e. system 'hardware'), including (i) Surveillance, (ii) Infrastructure and medical supplies, (iii) Workforce, and (iv) Communication mechanisms; and two focused on human and institutional relationships, values and norms (i.e. system 'software'), including (i) Governance, and (ii) Trust. The article reinforces the interconnectedness of the traditional health system building blocks to EID detection, prevention and response, and highlights the critical role of system 'software' (i.e. governance and trust) in enabling LMIC health systems to achieve and maintain EID preparedness. The review provides recommendations for refining a set of indicators for an 'optimised' health system EID preparedness tool to aid health system strengthening efforts.","Palagyi, Anna; Marais, Ben J; Abimbola, Seye; Topp, Stephanie M; McBryde, Emma S; Negin, Joel",Global public health,231,1

An early lytic gene of KSHV encodes viral interleukin-6 (vIL-6), a viral homologue of the proinflammatory cytokine and an autocrine/paracrine growth factor human IL-6. In this study, we examined the effects of suppressing vIL-6 expression in PEL cells with antisense peptide-conjugated phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomers (PPMO). PPMO are ssDNA-analogues that have a modified backbone and enter cells readily. Treatment of PEL cells with a PPMO designed against vIL-6 mRNA led to a marked reduction in the proportion of vIL-6-positive cells detected by immunofluorescence assay. Analysis by Western blot confirmed a specific reduction in the vIL-6 protein level and showed that the reduction was dependent on the dose of vIL-6 PPMO. PEL cells treated with the vIL-6 PPMO exhibited reduced levels of cellular growth, IL-6 expression and KSHV DNA, and an elevated level of p21 protein. Treatment of PEL cells with a combination of two vIL-6 PPMO compounds targeting different sequences in the vIL-6 mRNA led to an inhibitory effect that was greater than that achieved with either PPMO alone. These results show that PPMO targeting vIL-6 mRNA can potently reduce vIL-6 protein translation and indicate that further exploration of these compounds in an animal model for potential clinical application is warranted.","Zhang, Yan-Jin; Bonaparte, Rheba S; Patel, Deendayal; Stein, David A; Iversen, Patrick L",Molecular cancer therapeutics,231,27

METHODS Nine hundred ninety-two parents of children and adolescents with ADHD filled out an anonymous online survey through the ADHD family association website. The survey investigated the sleep patterns and disturbances (using a modified version of the Sleep Disturbance Scale for Children) and screen exposure time before and during the lockdown. RESULTS During the lockdown, 59.3% of children and 69.4% of adolescents with ADHD reported a change of bedtime with significant increase of ADHD patients that went to sleep at 11pm or later. Sleep duration, in contrast, resulted in two opposing processes with more children and adolescent sleeping either less than 6 hours/night or 10-11 hours/night. Among children and adolescents, respectively, 19.9% and 22% slept less than they did before lockdown, while 21.4% and 27.4% slept more hours. Bedtime delay and decreased sleep duration were associated with an increase in the screen time exposure. Moreover, ADHD patients reported an increase in sleep disturbances when compared to previous condition, including mainly difficulties falling asleep, anxiety at bedtime, night awakenings, nightmares and daytime sleepiness.

DESIGN A convergent segregated review design was used to conduct a systematic review. DATA SOURCES Ovid MEDLINE, Scopus, Web of Science and Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature were searched for articles published between January 2000 and November 2020. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA FOR SELECTING STUDIES Qualitative, quantitative and mixed-methods studies investigating the impact of the built environment of inpatient rehabilitation facilities on stroke survivors, their family/caregivers and/or staff. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS Two authors separately completed the title, abstract, full-text screening, data extraction and quality assessment. Extracted data were categorised according to the aspect of the built environment explored and the outcomes reported. These categories were used to structure a narrative synthesis of the results from all included studies. RESULTS Twenty-four articles were included, most qualitative and exploratory. Half of the included articles investigated a particular aspect of the built environment, including environmental enrichment and communal areas (n=8), bedroom design (n=3) and therapy spaces (n=1), while the other half considered the environment in general. Findings related to one or more of the following outcome categories: (1) clinical outcomes, (2) patient activity, (3) patient well-being, (4) patient and/or staff safety and (5) clinical practice. Heterogeneous designs and variables of interest meant results could not be compared, but some repeated findings suggest that attractive and accessible communal areas are important for patient activity and well-being. CONCLUSIONS Stroke rehabilitation is a unique healthcare context where patient activity, practice and motivation are paramount. We found many evidence gaps that with more targeted research could better inform the design of rehabilitation spaces to optimise care.

The present study evaluated the efficacy of the ""slow firing method"" using a reinforced triple-row stapler (Covidien, Tokyo, Japan) during LDP. METHODS This retrospective single-center study included 73 consecutive patients who underwent LDP using the slow firing method. A black cartridge was used in all patients. The primary endpoint was the rate of clinically relevant POPF (CR-POPF) after LDP. Secondary endpoints included perioperative outcomes and factors associated with CR-POPF as well as the correlation between the transection time and thickness of the pancreas. RESULTS Four patients (5.5%) developed CR-POPF (grade B). Overall morbidity rates, defined as grade ≥ II and ≥ III according to the Clavien-Dindo classification, were 21 and 11%, respectively. The median postoperative hospital stay was 10 days. Preoperative diabetes (13.6 vs. 0.2%, P = 0.044) and thickness of the pancreas ≥ 15 mm (13.8% vs. 0%, P = 0.006) were identified as independent risk factors for CR-POPF. The median transection time was 16 (8-29) min.

In this study, the neuroimaging findings and clinical course of adult patients admitted with COVID-19 to a tertiary care hospital network in Canada were characterized. METHODS This is a retrospective observational study conducted at a tertiary hospital network in Ontario, Canada. All adult patients with PCR-confirmed COVID-19 admitted from February 1, 2020 to July 22, 2020 who received neuroimaging related to their COVID-19 admission were included. CT and MR images were reviewed and categorized by fellowship-trained neuroradiologists. Demographic and clinical data were collected and correlated with imaging findings. RESULTS We identified 422 patients admitted with COVID-19 during the study period. 103 (24.4%) met the inclusion criteria and were included: 30 ICU patients (29.1%) and 73 non-ICU patients (70.9%). A total of 198 neuroimaging studies were performed: 177 CTs and 21 MRIs. 17 out of 103 imaged patients (16.8%) had acute abnormalities on neuroimaging: 10 had macrohemorrhages (58.8%), 9 had acute ischemia (52.9%), 4 had SWI abnormalities (23.5%), and 1 had asymmetric sulcal effacement suggesting possible focal encephalitis (5.8%). ICU patients were more likely to have positive neuroimaging findings, more specifically acute ischemia and macrohemorrhages (P < 0.05). Macrohemorrhages were associated with increased mortality (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION Macrohemorrhages, acute ischemia and SWI abnormalities were the main neuroimaging abnormalities in our cohort of hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Acute ischemia and hemorrhage were associated with worse clinical status.","Jegatheeswaran, Vibeeshan; Chan, Michael W K; Chakrabarti, Sumon; Fawcett, Adrian; Chen, Yingming Amy",Canadian Association of Radiologists journal = Journal l'Association canadienne des radiologistes,231,20

Numerous scientists recognise the relevance of further studying this relationship in order to improve our understanding of it. However, studies about the association between physical activity and presenteeism show some discrepancy in the results obtained. Disparity in the way of measuring presenteeism makes it even more challenging to compare results. In addition, it remains difficult to determine the optimal frequency, intensity, duration and type of physical activity to increase the productivity benefits of physical activity. In light of these issues, clarification through a scoping review of the literature on the subject is warranted. METHOD AND ANALYSIS A search strategy will be conducted in six scientific databases: MEDLINE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, ABI Inform Global, Web of Science and Business Source Premier. A screening process by two independent reviewers will lead to study selection. Quantitative and qualitative studies written in English about the relation between physical activity and presenteeism will be considered for inclusion. Data on the definition and measurement of presenteeism as well as the measurement of physical activity will be extracted. Additional data will be extracted to provide a descriptive overview of studies that have examined the relationship between presenteeism and physical activity. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION As this study will be based only on published studies, ethics approval is not required. Through the manner in which the included studies will be presented (categorised by their approach to presenteeism), this scoping review has the potential to improve our understanding of some of the inconsistencies observed in the literature.

OBJECTIVE To analyze our institution's longitudinal experience of endovascular treatment for pediatric aneurysms to better understand this rare condition. METHODS A retrospective record review was performed of patients aged <20 years treated with endovascular methods for intracranial aneurysms between 1995 and 2012. There were 31 patients (average 14.4±4.2 years; 20 male, 11 female) with 35 intracranial aneurysms. RESULTS The rate of subarachnoid hemorrhage as the initial presentation was 48% and the rates of multiple and giant aneurysms were 13% and 31%, respectively; 28.5% of the cases were posterior circulation aneurysms. Fifteen saccular aneurysms occurred in 14 patients and 17 fusiform aneurysms were noted in 14 patients. Two infectious aneurysms were diagnosed in two patients and one traumatic aneurysm occurred in another patient. Thirty-four aneurysms were treated endovascularly and one had thrombosed spontaneously on a follow-up angiogram. Of the 15 saccular aneurysms, 11 were treated with conventional coiling, one was treated with stent-assisted coiling, one was treated with a flow-diverting stent and two were treated with parent vessel occlusion (PVO). Of the 17 fusiform aneurysms, 15 were treated with PVO with or without prior bypass surgery and one was treated with a flow-diverting stent. The rate of permanent complications and a favorable outcome were 2.9% and 87%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS Endovascular treatment of pediatric aneurysms is technically feasible with an acceptable complication rate despite the high incidence of fusiform aneurysms.","Takemoto, Koichiro; Tateshima, Satoshi; Golshan, Ali; Gonzalez, Nestor; Jahan, Reza; Duckwiler, Gary; Vinuela, Fernando",Journal of neurointerventional surgery,231,10

METHOD AND MATERIALS In this clinical trial, 46 patients fulfilling the inclusion criteria were randomly divided into two equal groups: group I (n = 22) received IANB in a closed operatory without any fragrance, whereas group II (n = 24) received IANB in a separate closed operatory saturated with lavender fragrance using a candle warmer. The modified dental anxiety scale (MDAS) for anxiety and visual analog scale (VAS) for pain were recorded preoperatively as well as during access cavity preparation. For MDAS, a total score of more than 18 was considered as tremendously anxious or dental phobic. No or mild pain on VAS was considered as success. Data were analyzed using paired t test and independent sample t test. P < .05 was considered as statistically significant. RESULTS Difference in mean VAS (P = .749) and MDAS (P = 1.000) between both the groups was statistically nonsignificant. However there was a statistically significant difference in mean VAS (P = .000) and MDAS (P = .001) during access opening.

BACKGROUND The contribution of our study is to use qualitative methods to understand nurses' experiences and perceptions of the risk of the contagion linked to the shortage of PPE during the first wave of the pandemic, whose explosive start strained health systems around the globe. DESIGN Qualitative descriptive design according to the Rapid Research Evaluation and Appraisal model. METHODS Semi-structured videoconference interviews were conducted to explore the experiences of 29 nurses including staff nurses, nursing supervisors and nursing directors from hospital and community services of the Spanish health system. Interviews lasted 30-45 min and were conducted in May 2020. We carried out a thematic analysis using Dedoose. The COREQ checklist was used to report findings. RESULTS We identified the following themes and subthemes: 1. Experiences with personal protective equipment: scarcity, inequality, reutilization, self-protection, delegation of responsibility, and gap between protocols and reality; 2. Perception of the risk of contagion: lack of credibility, lack of trust, lack of support, and meeting subjective needs. CONCLUSIONS The scarcity of personal protective equipment and inequality in its distribution led nurses to take initiatives to feel more protected. Mid-ranking supervisors were caught between the responsibility of monitoring and rationing personal protective equipment and providing the necessary protection to nurses. The disjuncture between protocols and the available supply of personal protective equipment caused confusion. Lack of credibility, lack of trust and lack of support from management influenced participants' perception of the risk of contagion. Mid-ranking supervisors were often responsible for trying to alleviate fear among nursing staff. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE Understanding the factors involved in risk perception can be helpful to decision-makers who help protect nurses in clinical practice. These results can help administrators and policymakers because they point to the need for nurses to feel that their departments and centers look after their safety at work. Transparent communication and emotional support may contribute to their well-being in the face of risk.","Romeu-Labayen, Maria; Tort-Nasarre, Glòria; Alvarez, Bruna; Subias-Miquel, Martí; Vázquez-Segura, Eva; Marre, Diana; Galbany-Estragués, Paola",Journal of clinical nursing,231,1

In this pilot study, we sought to characterize the presence of education regarding sun safety in the curricula of US public high schools. Cross-sectional survey administered to random sample stratified by state of public high schools in the US. 31 high schools from 22 states submitted survey responses (Fig. 1). Ten high schools (32.2%) provided curricula regarding sun safety. Southern high schools were less likely to provide sun safety education (p = 0.01). The lack of an association between sociodemographic characteristics of the high school and the provision of sun safety curricula suggests that the lack of sun safety education may be widespread. These findings support a call to action regarding further research to better characterize the efficacy of implementing sun safety education in high school curricula. Educational interventions designed to inform high school students about sun safety present a unique opportunity to intervene in the rising skin cancer rates in the AYA population. As rates of skin cancer in AYA continue to rise, it is vital to develop strategies to implement education regarding sun safety and skin cancer risk factors in high school curricula.","Tripathi, Raghav; Tamashunas, Nina L; Xiang, Laura; Simmons, Elanee; Mazmudar, Rishabh S; Bordeaux, Jeremy S; Scott, Jeffrey F",Archives of dermatological research,231,10

Double-crown technique was used in all of the cases to secure the mesh to the anterior abdominal wall. Results. The mean operation time was 120 minutes. The patients were mobilized and led for oral intake at the first postoperative day. No morbidity occurred. Conclusion. Abdominal incisional hernias can be repaired via single incision with a mesh application in experienced centers.,"Barbaros, Umut; Demirel, Tugrul; Sumer, Aziz; Deveci, Ugur; Tukenmez, Mustafa; Cansunar, Mehmet Ibrahim; Kalayci, Murat; Dınccag, Ahmet; Seven, Ridvan; Mercan, Selcuk",Diagnostic and therapeutic endoscopy,231,1

We aimed to demonstrate the appropriate selection criteria of CE and single balloon-assisted enteroscopy (SBE) for patients with OGIB according to their conditions, by retrospectively comparing the diagnostic performances of CE and BE for detecting the source of the OGIB. METHODS We investigated 194 patients who underwent CE and/or BE. The rate of positive findings, details of the findings, accidental symptoms, and hemostasis methods were examined and analyzed. RESULTS CE and SBE were performed in 103 and 91 patients, respectively, and 26 patients underwent both examinations. The rate of positive findings was significantly higher with SBE (73.6%) than with CE (47.5%, p<0.01). The rate of positive findings was higher in overt bleeding cases than in occult bleeding cases for both BE and SBE. Among the overt bleeding cases, the rate was significantly higher in ongoing bleeding cases than in previous bleeding cases. CONCLUSIONS Both CE and SBE are useful to diagnose OGIB. For overt bleeding cases and ongoing bleeding cases, SBE may be more appropriate than CE because endoscopic diagnosis and treatment can be completed simultaneously.","Ooka, Shohei; Kobayashi, Kiyonori; Kawagishi, Kana; Kodo, Masaru; Yokoyama, Kaoru; Sada, Miwa; Tanabe, Satoshi; Koizumi, Wasaburo",Clinical endoscopy,231,14

This may be followed by a pro-thrombotic state and increased D-dimer. It has been anticipated that tocilizumab (TCZ), an anti-IL-6 receptor, would mitigate inflammation and coagulation in COVID-19 patients. However, clinical trials with TCZ recorded an increase in D-dimer. In contrast to TCZ, colchicine reduced D-dimer COVID-19 patients. To understand how the two anti-inflammatory agents have diverse effects on the D-dimer levels, we present the data from two clinical trials we performed. In the first trial, TCZ was administered to positive PCR test for COVID-19 patients (8 mg/kg. In the second trial, colchicine was given (0.5 mg twice a day). We found that TCZ increased significantly IL-6, α-Defensin (α-Def), a pro-thrombotic peptide, and D-dimer. In contrast, treatment with colchicine reduced α-Def and Di-dimer levels. In-vitro studies show that IL-6 stimulated the release of α-Def from human neutrophils but in contrast to colchicine, TCZ did not inhibit the stimulatory effect of IL-6; raising the possibility that the increase in IL-6 in patients with COVID-19 disease treated with TCZ triggers the release of α-Def that promotes prothrombotic events reflected in an increase in D-Dimer.","Abdeen, Suhair; Abu-Fanne, Rami; Bdeir, Khalil; Maraga, Emad; Higazi, Mohamed; Cines, Douglas B; Heyman, Samuel N; Higazi, Abd Al-Roof",British journal of haematology,231,24

STUDY DESIGN Descriptive study. PLACE AND DURATION OF STUDY Sakarya University Education and Training Hospital, Sakarya, Turkey, between April 1 and 30, 2020. METHODOLOGY The study included 55 patients who were admitted with diagnosis of COVID-19, and whose illnesses showed a critical course that leads to AKI. The variables were studied as per objective. RESULTS During the follow-up, 43 out of 55 patients (78.2%) died and 12 (21.8%) were discharged with recovery. The mortality was higher in patients at stage 3 (88.9% mortality) compared to stage 2 (53.8% mortality) (p=0.014). In the nonsurvivor group, RDW (red cell distribution width) and albumin levels were lower at admission; whereas, the LDH levels and CRP/albumin ratios were higher. On regression analysis, low albumin level (OR: 12.793, p = 0.010), high LDH level (OR: 8.454, p = 0.026), and presence of stage 3 AKI (OR: 10.268, p = 0.020) were found as independent risk factors for mortality in COVID-19 patients, who developed AKI. CONCLUSION In critically ill patients with COVID-19 pneumonia, who developed AKI, it was seen that the presence of low albumin, high LDH, and stage 3 AKI at the time of admission could be used as predictors of mortality. Moreover,, it was shown for the first time that in these patients, the high CRP/albumin ratio and low RDW could be associated with mortality.

Minichromosome maintenance eight homologous recombination repair factor (MCM8), a newly discovered MCM family member, has been shown to be required for DNA replication. Unfortunately, little is known concerning the roles of MCM8 in bladder cancer. METHODS The present study, we aimed at probing into the impacts and detailed mechanisms of MCM8 in bladder cancer progression. In this study, MCM8 expression level was detected through immunohistochemistry staining (IHC), qRT-PCR and Western blot assay. Silenced MCM8 cell models were constructed by lentivirus transfection. In vitro, the cell proliferation was evaluated by the MTT assay. The wound-healing assay and the transwell assay were utilized to assess the cell migration. Also, the cell apoptosis and the cell cycle were determined by flow cytometry. Moreover, the Human Apoptosis Antibody Array assay was performed to analyze the alterations of apoptosis-related proteins. The in vivo experiments were conducted to verify the effects of MCM8 knockdown on the tumor growth of bladder cancer. RESULTS The results demonstrated that compared with normal adjacent tissues, MCM8 expression in bladder cancer tissues was strongly up-regulated. The up-regulation of MCM8 expression in bladder cancer may be a valuable independent prognostic indicator. Of note, MCM8 inhibition modulated the malignant phenotypes of bladder cancer cells. In terms of mechanism, it was validated that MCM8 knockdown made Akt, P-Akt, CCND1 and CDK6 levels down-regulated, as well as MAPK9 up-regulated. CONCLUSIONS Taken together, our study demonstrated an important role of MCM8 in bladder cancer and created a rationale for the therapeutic potential of MCM8 inhibition in human bladder cancer therapy.","Zhu, Wei; Gao, Fei; Zhou, Hongyi; Jin, Ke; Shao, Jianfeng; Xu, Zhuoqun",Cancer cell international,231,1

To obtain deeper insights into the functional roles of TORC1, we performed a genome-wide analysis of the TORC1 interactome in yeast using the bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) assay. We found that while most of the BiFC signals are observed at the vacuolar membrane, a fraction of them are detected at cytoplasmic messenger ribonucleoprotein (mRNP) granules. Moreover, mRNA-binding proteins are enriched in the TORC1 interactome, suggesting a functional relationship between TORC1 and mRNA metabolism. We show that a portion of TORC1 is consistently associated with mRNP complexes and interacts with a specific subset of mRNAs. We also demonstrate that TORC1 directly targets a translational repressor Scd6 and that the activity of Scd6 is inhibited by TORC1-dependent phosphorylation.

Aim This study proposes a methodology to estimate the saturation moment of hospital intensive care beds (critical care beds) and determine the number of units required to compensate for this saturation. Methods A total of 22,016 patients with diagnostic confirmation for COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2 were analyzed between March 4 and May 5, 2020, nationwide. Based on information from the Chilean Ministry of Health and ministerial announcements in the media, the overall availability of critical care beds was estimated at 1,900 to 2,000. The Gompertz function was used to estimate the expected number of COVID-19 patients and to assess their exposure to the available supply of intensive care beds in various possible scenarios, taking into account the supply of total critical care beds, the average occupational index, and the demand for COVID-19 patients who would require an intensive care bed. Results A 100% occupancy of critical care beds could be reached between May 11 and May 27. This condition could be extended for around 48 days, depending on how the expected over-demand is managed. Conclusion A simple, easily interpretable, and applicable to all levels (nationwide, regionwide, municipalities, and hospitals) model is offered as a contribution to managing the expected demand for the coming weeks and helping reduce the adverse effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Peña, Víctor Hugo; Espinosa, Alejandra",Medwave,231,1

This is a source of unintended thermal injury to patients. Stray energy emitted from the dispersive electrode cord has not been studied. The purpose of this study was to determine whether, and to what extent, the dispersive electrode cord contributes to unintentional energy transfer and describe practical steps to minimize risk. METHODS In a laparoscopic simulator, a monopolar generator delivered radiofrequency energy to an L-hook. Thermal imaging quantified the change in tissue temperature nearest to the tip of a non-electrical instrument following activation. The orientation of the dispersive electrode cord was varied relative to other instruments. RESULTS When the dispersive electrode cord is parallel to the camera cord, tissue temperature increased at the telescope tip by 46 ± 6 °C from baseline (p < 0.001). Similar heat was generated when the camera cord was oriented parallel to the active electrode cord (46 ± 6 vs. 48 ± 7 °C, respectively, p = 0.48). Adding a second dispersive electrode decreased the temperature change (46 ± 6 vs. 25 ± 9 °C, p < 0.001). Temperature increase was greater with coagulation versus cut mode (33 ± 7 vs. 22 ± 6 °C, p < 0.001). CONCLUSION Stray energy emitted from the dispersive electrode cord heats tissue >40 °C via antenna coupling; the same magnitude as the active electrode cord. Practical steps to minimize stray energy transfer include avoiding orienting the dispersive electrode cord in parallel with other cords, adding a second dispersive electrode, and using low-voltage cut mode.","Townsend, Nicole T; Nadlonek, Nicole A; Jones, Edward L; McHenry, Jennifer R; Dunne, Bruce; Stiegmann, Gregory V; Robinson, Thomas N",Surgical endoscopy,231,13

Asprosin induces rapid glucose releases from the liver. However, its molecular mechanisms and function are still unclear. Adaptation of energy substrates from fatty acid to glucose is recently considered a novel therapeutic target in heart failure treatment. We hypothesized that the asprosin is able to modulate cardiac mitochondrial functions and has important prognostic implications in dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) patients. METHODS We prospectively enrolled 50 patients (86% male, mean age 55 ± 13 years) with DCM and followed their 5-year major adverse cardiovascular events from 2012 to 2017. Comparing with healthy individuals, DCM patients had higher asprosin levels (191.2 versus 79.7 ng/mL, P < 0.01). RESULTS During the 5-year follow-up in the study cohort, 16 (32.0%) patients experienced adverse cardiovascular events. Patients with lower asprosin levels (< 210 ng/mL) were associated with increased risks of adverse clinical outcomes with a hazard ratio of 7.94 (95% CI 1.88-33.50, P = 0.005) when compared patients with higher asprosin levels (≥ 210 ng/mL). Using cardiomyoblasts as a cellular model, we showed that asprosin prevented hypoxia-induced cell death and enhanced mitochondrial respiration and proton leak under hypoxia. CONCLUSIONS In patients with DCM, elevated plasma asprosin levels are associated with less adverse cardiovascular events in five years. The underlying protective mechanisms of asprosin may be linked to its functions relating to enhanced mitochondrial respiration under hypoxia.","Wen, Ming-Shien; Wang, Chao-Yung; Yeh, Jih-Kai; Chen, Chun-Chi; Tsai, Ming-Lung; Ho, Ming-Yun; Hung, Kuo-Chun; Hsieh, I-Chang",BMC cardiovascular disorders,231,17

Comparing the safety and effectiveness of treatments for vasomotor symptoms is limited by the use of inconsistent outcome measures, and uncertainty as to which outcomes are most important to symptomatic women. To address this, we have developed a Core Outcome Set (COS) for use in clinical trials of treatments for VMS. METHODS We systematically reviewed the primary outcomes measured in randomized controlled trials of treatments for VMS. These were refined and entered into a two-round modified Delphi survey completed by clinicians, researchers, and postmenopausal women between November 2019 and March 2020. Outcomes were scored on a nine-point scale from ""not important"" to ""critically important."" Two international consensus meetings were held to finalize the COS. RESULTS Based on the systematic review, 13 separate outcomes were included in the Delphi process. This was completed by 227 participants of whom 58% were postmenopausal women, 34% clinicians, and 8% researchers. Predefined thresholds were applied to categorize importance scores obtained during Round 2 of the Delphi survey. These informed discussions at the consensus meetings which were attended by 56 participants from 28 countries. The final COS includes six outcomes: 1) frequency of VMS, 2) severity of VMS, 3) distress, bother or interference caused by VMS, 4) impact on sleep, 5) satisfaction with treatment, and 6) side-effects of treatment. CONCLUSION Implementation of this COS will: better enable research studies to accurately reflect the joint priorities of postmenopausal women, clinicians and researchers, standardize outcome reporting, and facilitate combining and comparing results from different studies, and ultimately improve outcomes for women with bothersome VMS.

We investigated the effect of a sliding hip screw versus cancellous screws on the risk of reoperation and other key outcomes. METHODS For this international, multicentre, allocation concealed randomised controlled trial, we enrolled patients aged 50 years or older with a low-energy hip fracture requiring fracture fixation from 81 clinical centres in eight countries. Patients were assigned by minimisation with a centralised computer system to receive a single large-diameter screw with a side-plate (sliding hip screw) or the present standard of care, multiple small-diameter cancellous screws. Surgeons and patients were not blinded but the data analyst, while doing the analyses, remained blinded to treatment groups. The primary outcome was hip reoperation within 24 months after initial surgery to promote fracture healing, relieve pain, treat infection, or improve function. Analyses followed the intention-to-treat principle. This study was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00761813. FINDINGS Between March 3, 2008, and March 31, 2014, we randomly assigned 1108 patients to receive a sliding hip screw (n=557) or cancellous screws (n=551). Reoperations within 24 months did not differ by type of surgical fixation in those included in the primary analysis: 107 (20%) of 542 patients in the sliding hip screw group versus 117 (22%) of 537 patients in the cancellous screws group (hazard ratio [HR] 0·83, 95% CI 0·63-1·09; p=0·18). Avascular necrosis was more common in the sliding hip screw group than in the cancellous screws group (50 patients [9%] vs 28 patients [5%]; HR 1·91, 1·06-3·44; p=0·0319). However, no significant difference was found between the number of medically related adverse events between groups (p=0·82; appendix); these events included pulmonary embolism (two patients [<1%] vs four [1%] patients; p=0·41) and sepsis (seven [1%] vs six [1%]; p=0·79).

The underlying mechanism of PND is unclear, and no effective therapies are currently available. It is believed that neuroinflammation plays an important role in triggering PND. The secreted glycoprotein myeloid differentiation factor 2 (MD2) functions as an activator of the Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) inflammatory pathway, and α5GABAA receptors (α5GABAARs) are known to play a key role in regulating inflammation-induced cognitive deficits. Thus, in this study, we aimed to investigate the role of MD2 in PND and determine whether α5GABAARs are involved in the function of MD2. METHODS Eighteen-month-old C57BL/6J mice were subjected to laparotomy under isoflurane anesthesia to induce PND. The Barnes maze was used to assess spatial reference learning and memory, and the expression of hippocampal MD2 was assayed by western blotting. MD2 expression was downregulated by bilateral injection of AAV-shMD2 into the hippocampus or tail vein injection of the synthetic MD2 degrading peptide Tat-CIRP-CMA (TCM) to evaluate the effect of MD2. Primary cultured neurons from brain tissue block containing cortices and hippocampus were treated with Tat-CIRP-CMA to investigate whether downregulating MD2 expression affected the expression of α5GABAARs. Electrophysiology was employed to measure tonic currents. For α5GABAARs intervention experiments, L-655,708 and L-838,417 were used to inhibit or activate α5GABAARs, respectively. RESULTS Surgery under inhaled isoflurane anesthesia induced cognitive impairments and elevated the expression of MD2 in the hippocampus. Downregulation of MD2 expression by AAV-shMD2 or Tat-CIRP-CMA improved the spatial reference learning and memory in animals subjected to anesthesia and surgery. Furthermore, Tat-CIRP-CMA treatment decreased the expression of membrane α5GABAARs and tonic currents in CA1 pyramidal neurons in the hippocampus. Inhibition of α5GABAARs by L-655,708 alleviated cognitive impairments after anesthesia and surgery. More importantly, activation of α5GABAARs by L-838,417 abrogated the protective effects of Tat-CIRP-CMA against anesthesia and surgery-induced spatial reference learning and memory deficits. CONCLUSIONS MD2 contributes to the occurrence of PND by regulating α5GABAARs in aged mice, and Tat-CIRP-CMA is a promising neuroprotectant against PND.","Zuo, Wenqiang; Zhao, Jianshuai; Zhang, Jinming; Fang, Zongping; Deng, Jiao; Fan, Ze; Guo, Yaru; Han, Jing; Hou, Wugang; Dong, Hailong; Xu, Feifei; Xiong, Lize",Journal of neuroinflammation,231,1

This study aimed to provide an insight into mental well-being of pregnant women in Denmark during COVID-19 by assessing symptoms of depression and anxiety. METHODS Data from two cohorts of pregnant women recruited from Danish general practice were compared. A COVID-19 lockdown cohort (N=330) completed questionnaires between 8 April and 6 May. Responses were compared to those from a control cohort of women from 2016 (N=1428). Mental well-being was measured with the Major Depression Inventory (MDI) and the Anxiety Symptom Scale (ASS). RESULTS Questionnaires were returned by 83% of the COVID-19 lockdown cohort and by 93% of the control cohort. Multivariable analysis controlling for age, cohabitation status, occupation, smoking, alcohol use, chronic disease, fertility treatment, parity and children living at home showed no difference in depressive symptoms (MDI). Anxiety symptoms (ASS) were slightly worse in the COVID-19 lockdown cohort (mean difference=1.4 points), mainly driven by questions concerning general anxiety. The largest differences in anxiety were seen in first trimester (adjusted mean difference=4.0 points).

Genetic variation in a cholesterol transport protein, apolipoprotein E (apoE), is the most common genetic risk factor for sporadic AD. In vitro evidence suggests that apoE links to Aβ production through nanoscale lipid compartments (lipid clusters), but its regulation in vivo is unclear. Here, we use superresolution imaging in the mouse brain to show that apoE utilizes astrocyte-derived cholesterol to specifically traffic neuronal amyloid precursor protein (APP) in and out of lipid clusters, where it interacts with β- and γ-secretases to generate Aβ-peptide. We find that the targeted deletion of astrocyte cholesterol synthesis robustly reduces amyloid and tau burden in a mouse model of AD. Treatment with cholesterol-free apoE or knockdown of cholesterol synthesis in astrocytes decreases cholesterol levels in cultured neurons and causes APP to traffic out of lipid clusters, where it interacts with α-secretase and gives rise to soluble APP-α (sAPP-α), a neuronal protective product of APP. Changes in cellular cholesterol have no effect on α-, β-, and γ-secretase trafficking, suggesting that the ratio of Aβ to sAPP-α is regulated by the trafficking of the substrate, not the enzymes. We conclude that cholesterol is kept low in neurons, which inhibits Aβ accumulation and enables the astrocyte regulation of Aβ accumulation by cholesterol signaling.","Wang, Hao; Kulas, Joshua A; Wang, Chao; Holtzman, David M; Ferris, Heather A; Hansen, Scott B",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,231,1

Multiple small-animal models of heart transplantation have been used to study the acute and long-term effects of novel therapies. However, few are tested and demonstrated success in clinical trials. It is of critical importance to evaluate new therapies in a clinically relevant large-animal model for efficient and reliable translation of basic studies' findings. Here, we describe a pre-clinical large-animal (porcine) model of orthotopic heart transplantation that has been firmly established and previously used to investigate novel cardioprotective strategies. This procedure focuses on acute ischemia-reperfusion injury and is a reliable method to investigate novel interventions which have been tested and validated in smaller experimental models, such as the murine model. We demonstrate its usefulness in assessing cardiac performance during the early post-transplantation period and other potential possibilities enabled by the model.","Ribeiro, Roberto V P; Alvarez, Juglans S; Yu, Frank; Adamson, Mitchell B; Fukunaga, Naoto; Serrick, Cyril; Bissoondath, Ved; Meineri, Massimiliano; Badiwala, Mitesh V; Rao, Vivek",Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE,231,15

However, viruses have also been associated with petechial rash. Nonetheless, a systematic analysis of viral infections with modern available techniques as quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction in the context of petechial rash is lacking. The purpose of this pediatric study was to prospectively uncover viral pathogens that may promote the emergence of petechiae and to analyze the correlation with the clinical characteristics and course. METHODS We conducted a prospective study in children (0 to 18 years) presenting with petechiae and signs or symptoms of infection at the emergency department between November 2009 and March 2012. In nasopharyngeal aspirates the following viruses were analyzed by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction: cytomegalovirus, Epstein-Barr virus, parvovirus B19, influenza A and B, parainfluenza viruses, human respiratory syncytial virus A and B, human metapneumovirus, rhinovirus, enterovirus, adenovirus, human coronavirus OC43, 229E, NL63 and human bocavirus. RESULTS A viral pathogen was identified in 67% of the analyzed 58 cases with petechial rash. Virus positive patients showed a significantly higher incidence of lower respiratory tract infections. Forty-one percent were viral coinfections, which were significantly younger than virus negative patients, had a higher leukocyte count and were hospitalized for a longer time. CONCLUSIONS A petechial rash is frequently associated viral single- and coinfections and can rapidly be identified via quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction.","Schneider, Henriette; Adams, Ortwin; Weiss, Christel; Merz, Ulrich; Schroten, Horst; Tenenbaum, Tobias",The Pediatric infectious disease journal,231,1

In these clinical settings, the diagnosis can be established with the help of medical history, physical examination, and promptly performed imaging tests. However, the diagnosis of an asymptomatic aortic aneurysm is usually incidental. Thus, it is very rare to find a case of ACS with intact aortic aneurysm and without obstructive coronary artery disease.

Generating SSI rates often requires labor-intensive methods, but increasing numbers of publications reported SSI rates using administrative data. METHODS Index laminectomy and spinal fusion procedures were identified using Canadian Classification of Health Interventions (CCI) procedure codes for inpatients and outpatients in the province of Alberta, Canada between 2008 and 2015. SSIs occurring in the year post-surgery were identified using the International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision, Canada (ICD-10-CA) diagnosis and CCI procedure codes indicative of post-op infection. Rates of SSIs and case characteristics were reported. RESULTS Over the eight-year study period, 21,222 index spinal procedures were identified of which 12,027 (56.7%) were laminectomy procedures, with 322 SSIs identified, an SSI rate of 2.7 per 100 procedures. Of the 9,195 (43.3%) fusion procedures, 298 were identified as an SSI, an SSI rate of 3.2 per 100 procedures. This study found SSI rates increased from 2008 and 2015, and rates were the highest in the 0-18 year age group. CONCLUSIONS The rates reported in this study were similar to published SSI rates using traditional surveillance methods, suggesting administrative data may be a viable method for reporting SSI rates following spinal procedures. Further work is needed to validate SSIs identified using administrative data by comparing to traditional surveillance.","Crocker, Alysha; Kornilo, Anna; Conly, John; Henderson, Elizabeth; Rennert-May, Elissa; Leal, Jenine",American journal of infection control,231,7

Still, little is known about the psychological experiences of patients who received inpatient isolation treatment in order to improve the well-being of these patients. We randomly recruited 10 COVID-19 patients who received inpatient isolation treatment at a designated hospital in Wuhan from February to March 2020 and were discharged after recovery. The data were collected via a semi-structured interview over WeChat video and analyzed them using Calaizzi's descriptive phenomenological method. COVID-19 patients experienced significant psychological stress during hospitalization that continued after recovery and discharge. This can be categorized into three themes: (1) negative emotions experienced; (2) uncertainty of treatment provided; and (3) worries about readjusting to daily life. The insight into a patient's psychological experiences can support the timely implementation of personalized nursing interventions within hospitals and the community to improve the patient's mental well-being and recovery trajectory.","Pei, Haoyu; Wu, Qiuping; Xie, Yu; Deng, Jing; Jiang, Limei; Gan, Xiaoqin",Clinical nursing research,231,1

Although such devices are not novel, devising insole devices for gait analysis is still an important issue. OBJECTIVE The goal of this study is to develop a new portable system for plantar pressure distribution measurement based on a three-axis accelerometer. METHODS The portable system includes: PJRC Teensy 3.6 microcontroller with 32-bit ARM Cortex-M4 microprocessor with a clock speed of 180 MHz; HC-11 radio modules (transmitter and receiver); a battery; a fixing band; pressure sensors; MPU-9150 inertial navigation module; and FFC tape. The pressure insole is leather-based and consists of seven layers. It is divided into 16 areas and the outcome of the system is data concerning plantar pressure distribution under foot during gait. The system was tested on 22 healthy volunteer subjects, and the data was compared with a commercially available system: Medilogic. RESULT The SNR value for the proposed sensor is 28.27 dB. For a range of pressure of 30-100 N, the sensitivity is 0.0066 V/N while the linearity error is 0.05. The difference in plantar pressure from both the portable plantar pressure system and Medilogic is not statistically significant. CONCLUSION The proposed system could be recommended for research applications both inside and outside of a typical gait laboratory.","Ostaszewski, Michal; Pauk, Jolanta; Lesniewski, Kacper",Technology and health care : official journal of the European Society for Engineering and Medicine,231,15

METHODS We retrospectively analyzed the clinical outcomes of patients undergoing SPLS sigmoidectomy, either with transanal specimen extraction (TASE, n = 15) or transumbilical specimen extraction (TUSE, n = 68), for colorectal cancer between March 2009 and March 2013. The inclusion criterion was a tumor diameter of ≤ 5 cm. The median follow-up was 93 months (range 13 - 149). RESULTS Most of intraoperative and postoperative variables were comparable between the two groups, except for lengthening of operation time in TASE (287 ± 87 min vs. 226 ± 78 min, P = 0.011). TUSE did not lengthen the duration of postoperative recovery, hospital stay, or pain, or increase the incidence of postoperative complications. Whereas TUSE showed 8.8% (6/68) of wound-related complications, TASE did not show wound-related complications during follow-up period (P = 0.586). CONCLUSION With the exception of a prolonged operation time, TASE showed equivalent surgical outcomes as TUSE in SPLS sigmoidectomy. Thus, the implement of TASE is expected to provide one way of reducing wound-related complications in SPLS in patients with a tumor diameter of ≤5 cm.","Kim, Say-June; Choi, Byung-Jo; Lee, Sang Chul",BMC surgery,231,31

Nocturnally active males and females rely on their auditory sense to detect and locate vocally active conspecifics during social behaviors. Previous work showed that the midshipman inner ear saccule and lagena are highly adapted to detect and encode socially relevant acoustic stimuli, but the auditory sensitivity and function of the midshipman utricle remain largely unknown. Here, we characterize the auditory evoked potentials from hair cells in the utricle of non-reproductive type I males and test the hypothesis that the midshipman utricle is sensitive to behaviorally-relevant acoustic stimuli. Hair cell potentials were recorded from the rostral, medial and caudal regions of the utricle in response to pure tone stimuli presented by an underwater speaker. We show that the utricle is highly sensitive to particle motion stimuli produced by an underwater speaker positioned in the horizontal plane. Utricular potentials were recorded across a broad range of frequencies with lowest particle acceleration (dB re: 1 ms-2) thresholds occurring at 105 Hz (lowest frequency tested; mean threshold=-32 dB re: 1 ms-2) and highest thresholds at 605 to 1005 Hz (mean threshold range=-5 to -4 dB re: 1 ms-2). The high gain and broadband frequency sensitivity of the utricle suggests that it likely serves a primary auditory function and is well suited to detect conspecific vocalizations including broadband agonistic signals and the multiharmonic advertisement calls produce by reproductive type I males.","Rogers, Loranzie S; Sisneros, Joseph A",The Journal of experimental biology,231,19

CLINICAL FINDINGS The nasolacrimal orifice was absent in the left nasal meatum, and anterograde irrigation of left nasolacrimal duct was not possible. Dacryocystorhinography was performed and revealed about 4-6 cm of distal nasolacrimal duct atresia. SURGICAL TREATMENT AND OUTCOME A novel technique was attempted with the horse under standing sedation using an urinary catheter and a 980 nm diode laser with a 600 μm diameter flexible bare quartz fiber. A nasolacrimal orifice was successfully created by ablating the nasal mucosa directly over the tip of the urinary catheter, and patency was maintained with a soft catheter sutured in place for 4 weeks. At 3 months re-evaluation, the left nasolacrimal duct was patent and functional. CONCLUSION This case report describes a successful novel surgical technique used to correct congenital distal nasolacrimal duct atresia in an adult horse under standing sedation.

Nurses play a crucial role in care and therefore should keep up with this trend and improve their intercultural sensitivity. OBJECTIVE AND DESIGN This descriptive cross-sectional study investigated the effects of ethnocentrism and moral sensitivity on intercultural sensitivity in nursing students. METHODS AND PARTICIPANTS Data were collected using a demographic characteristics questionnaire and the Intercultural Sensitivity Scale, Generalized Ethnocentrism Scale, and Moral Sensitivity Scale. The sample consisted of 1343 nursing students. The Pearson correlation coefficient was used to determine correlations between scale scores. Multiple linear regression was used to determine the effects of ethnocentrism, moral sensitivity, and demographic characteristics on intercultural sensitivity. RESULTS Intercultural sensitivity was found to be negatively correlated with ethnocentrism and positively correlated with moral sensitivity. Ethnocentrism predicted intercultural sensitivity more than moral sensitivity. Ethnocentrism and moral sensitivity explained 16.8% of the total variance of intercultural sensitivity. However, ethnocentrism affected intercultural sensitivity more than moral sensitivity did (beta = -0.406). CONCLUSION Nursing education should adopt strategies to reduce ethnocentrism by helping students develop cultural competence and intercultural sensitivity. Such education can equip nurses to provide higher quality care to patients of different cultural backgrounds.","Kaya, Yunus; Arslan, Sevda; Erbaş, Atiye; Yaşar, Beril Nisa; Küçükkelepçe, Gülhan Erkuş",Nurse education today,231,1

MATERIAL AND METHODS A cross-sectional study was conducted during May 2020, using an online survey via Google forms. A self-administered validated structured questionnaire was applied, which comprised 28 questions among health care students/professionals at a tertiary care centrein North India. RESULTS A total of 956 respondents were included (10.2% nurses, 45.2% medical students, 24.3% paramedical students, 11.7% resident doctors and 8.6% consultant doctors). Overall knowledge score was 9.3/15; the highest for preventive practices (4/5), followed by clinical knowledge (2.7/5) and the use of personal protective equipment (PPE) (2.6/5). The overall score was the highest in consultant doctors (10.8) while the lowest in nurses (8.5) and paramedical students (8.4) (p < 0.001). Less than half of the respondents had knowledge about the correct sequence of doffing PPE and the use of N95 mask. About 21.8% of the participants experienced moderate to severe anxiety; higher among nurses (38%), followed by paramedical students (29.3%); and anxiety was higher when knowledge score was low (27.6% vs 14.7%); both factors were independent predictors on multivariate analysis (p < 0.001). Only 18.1% of the respondents applied HCQ prophylaxis - the highest proportion constituted consultants (42.7%), and the least - paramedical students (5.2%); (p < 0.001) and HCQ use was more frequently used if they had a family member of extreme age group at home (23.3% vs 12.2%; p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS The knowledge about correct PPE usage is low among all groups of HCWs and students, and there is a high prevalence of anxiety due to COVID-19. The lower COVID-19 knowledge scores were significantly associated with a higher likelihood of anxiety and inadequate use of HCQ prophylaxis. The appliance of HCQ prophylaxis had no significant association with anxiety levels of the respondents.","Jindal, Vinita; Mittal, Saurabh; Kaur, Tanvir; Bansal, Avtar Singh; Kaur, Prabhjot; Kaur, Gurmeet; Sati, Hem C; Garg, Avneet",Advances in respiratory medicine,231,1

In adolescents, detraining is poorly known as well as its prevention by homeexercises. This article aimed to assess the effects of Covid-19 confinement on detraining in young high-level soccer players despite a multimodal training program conducted at home. METHODS Twenty-five elite soccer players, aged 14, were included to perform physical exercises at home during the Covid-19 confinement. Two cardio-training sessions and two upper and lower limb muscle strengthening sessions were performed per week. The exercise program was monitored remotely via the web. Hooper, training and mental indexes allowed a psychological follow-up. The effect of Covid-19 confinement on aerobic capacity was measured using a pre- and post-confinement Yo-Yo test. RESULTS Out of the 25 adolescences who completed the exercises program, 19 performed the post-confinement Yo-Yo test. The running distance decreased by 614 +/- 630 m (-25%) (p = 0001) and the maximal running speed by 0.97 +/- 1 km/h (-5%) (p=0.001), confirming detraining.

The S2 domain of protein S has been suggested to have two fusion peptides, one located at its N-terminus, downstream of the furin cleavage, and another, more internal, located immediately upstream of the HR1. Therefore, we have carried out a study of the binding and interaction with model membranes of a peptide corresponding to segment 873-888 of the SARS-CoV S glycoprotein, peptide SARS IFP, as well as the structural changes taking place in both the phospholipid and the peptide induced by the binding of the peptide to the membrane. We demonstrate that SARS IFP peptide binds to and interacts with phospholipid model membranes and shows a higher affinity for negatively charged phospholipids than for zwitterionic ones. SARS IFP peptide specifically decreases the mobility of the phospholipid acyl chains of negatively charged phospholipids and adopts different conformations in the membrane depending upon their composition. These data support its role in SARS-mediated membrane fusion and suggest that the regions where this peptide resides might assist the fusion peptide and/or the pretransmembrane segment of the SARS-CoV spike glycoprotein in the fusion process.","Guillén, Jaime; Pérez-Berná, Ana J; Moreno, Miguel R; Villalaín, José",Biochemistry,231,16

Despite use of this strategy, the postthrombotic syndrome (PTS) develops frequently, causes substantial patient disability, and impairs quality of life. Pharmacomechanical catheter-directed thrombolysis (PCDT), which rapidly removes acute venous thrombus, may reduce the frequency of PTS. However, this hypothesis has not been tested in a large multicenter randomized trial. STUDY DESIGN The ATTRACT Study is an ongoing National Institutes of Health-sponsored, Phase III, multicenter, randomized, open-label, assessor-blinded, parallel two-arm, controlled clinical trial. Approximately 692 patients with acute proximal DVT involving the femoral, common femoral, and/or iliac vein are being randomized to receive PCDT + standard therapy versus standard therapy alone. The primary study hypothesis is that PCDT will reduce the proportion of patients who develop PTS within 2 years by one-third, assessed using the Villalta Scale. Secondary outcomes include safety, general and venous disease-specific quality of life, relief of early pain and swelling, and cost-effectiveness. CONCLUSION ATTRACT will determine if PCDT should be routinely used to prevent PTS in patients with symptomatic proximal DVT above the popliteal vein.","Vedantham, Suresh; Goldhaber, Samuel Z; Kahn, Susan R; Julian, Jim; Magnuson, Elizabeth; Jaff, Michael R; Murphy, Timothy P; Cohen, David J; Comerota, Anthony J; Gornik, Heather L; Razavi, Mahmood K; Lewis, Lawrence; Kearon, Clive",American heart journal,231,19

RESULTS There were no significant differences between the two groups in terms of age, sex, body mass index, smoking status, lung function test results, or volume ratio of the right upper lobe. A shorter distance from the carina to the middle lobe orifice was the only risk factor for a kinked middle lobar bronchus identified (40.25 ± 2.45 vs. 48.06 ± 4.78 mm, p = 0.006). CONCLUSION A short distance from the carina to the middle lobe orifice could be a risk factor for kinking of the middle lobar bronchus in postoperative middle lobe atelectasis after right upper lobectomy.","Masuda, Yoshiko; Marutsuka, Takashi; Suzuki, Makoto",Asian cardiovascular & thoracic annals,231,1

STUDY DESIGN Descriptive clinical study. ANIMALS Female lions (n = 16). METHODS Lionesses were randomly divided into 2 groups: O = ovariectomy (n = 8) and S = salpingectomy (n = 8) for laparoscopic surgery. Two Veress needle placement techniques were used. RESULTS Laparoscopic ovariectomy and salpingectomy were performed without complications. The poorly developed mesosalpinx and ovarian bursa rendered the uterine tube more accessible for salpingectomy compared to the dog making the procedure easier in the lioness. Similarly, salpingectomy is a relatively easier procedure compared with ovariectomy especially when the modified Hasson technique for Veress needle placement is used. CONCLUSIONS Laparoscopic ovariectomy and salpingectomy can be safely performed in the African lioness.","Hartman, Marthinus J; Monnet, Eric; Kirberger, Robert M; Venter, Leon J; Bester, Lynette; Schulman, Martin L; Serfontein, Tania; Fourie, Retha; Schoeman, Johan P",Veterinary surgery : VS,231,16

METHODS We analyzed Instagram posts from five randomly selected days in February 2020. The hashtag, #ivfcommunity, was selected to identify public posts authored by Instagram's IVF community members from multiple treatment centers. Text, photos, hashtags, and emojis were collected from 452 included posts and entered into a study-specific database. Using thematic coding, a four-member team initially coded the first day in February. Common themes were agreed upon by all team members, and a preliminary codebook was created for further analysis. The remaining posts were coded by two-member teams who reached a consensus on the multiple themes assigned to each individual post. RESULTS Analysis of posts led to the identification of five major themes: documentation of the medical and physical experience of IVF (76.1%), the emotional spectrum (43.1%), social support (49.2%), coping mechanisms (29.9%), and education (receipt, provision) (11.1%). CONCLUSION Our findings suggest that women undergoing IVF often utilize social media to document daily experiences, offer and recognize sources of community support, and provide and receive education regarding their treatments. Given the increased prevalence of mental health conditions, medical providers should explore challenges discussed on online platforms and consider harnessing the supportive nature of online communities to supplement care for IVF patients.","Perone, Hanna R; Herweck, Alexandra M; Stump, Hannah M; Levine, Hannah M; Wong, Adriana J; Carugno, Jose",Journal of assisted reproduction and genetics,231,1

The rapid diversification of their molecular structures, with often only minute differences, necessitates the development of adequate chromatographic techniques. While modified silica so far is the workhorse as stationary phase we have probed the potential of porous graphitic carbon (HypercarbTM) for this purpose. The results show that the multitude of physicochemical interactions between analyte molecules and the graphitic surface enables separations of polyolefin stabilizers with unprecedented selectivity. To support the chromatographic results the adsorption capability of HypercarbTM for selected antioxidants and UV absorbers has been determined by Raman spectroscopy and argon physisorption measurements. The shift of the Graphite-band in the Raman spectra of HypercarbTM upon infusion with additives correlates with the changes in the Adsorption Potential Distributions. The results of argon physisorption measurements go hand in hand with the chronology of desorption of the additives in liquid chromatography experiments. The elution sequence can be explained by van der Waals or London forces, π-π-interactions and electron lone pair donor-acceptor interactions between the graphite surface and analyte functional groups.","Kot, David; Zou, Mingyi; Brunnengräber, Kai; Arndt, Jan-Hendrik; Macko, Tibor; Etzold, Bastian J M; Brüll, Robert",Journal of chromatography.

Vacation may help alleviate burnout and improve WLI but working while on vacation may negate these potential benefits. Little is known about the work patterns of women physicians on vacation, and we attempted to further characterize it in this study. Methods: In this online cross-sectional study of 498 members of the Physician Women in Leadership Facebook Group, we collected demographic information, information regarding burnout/WLI, self-reported work patterns while on vacation, and perceived impact of working during vacation on burnout/WLI. We also asked about the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on these behaviors. Results: At baseline, 37.5% of respondents reported burnout and 58.4% reported lack of satisfaction with WLI. About 94.4% of respondents reported engaging in some level of work-related behavior while on vacation (primarily answering work-related emails and participating in work-related meetings), but 73.3% reported that such engagement was detrimental to their mental health and WLI. About 66.3% reported an increase in at least one work-related behavior on vacation during the COVID-19 pandemic. Respondents identified and/or endorsed multiple strategies to reduce work-related engagement on vacation, many involving good modeling by leadership and/or national associations. Conclusions: Engagement in work-related behavior while on vacation is almost universal among women physicians, but most feel that it has negative effects on mental health and WLI. Strategies to encourage reduced engagement should be developed/strengthened and endorsed/modeled by those in leadership.","Marshall, Ariela L; Elafros, Melissa; Duma, Narjust",Journal of women's health,231,11

Thirteen healthy subjects walked on rectilinear and curvilinear paths. Electromyographic data from thirteen back and lower-limb muscles were acquired, together with kinematic data using inertial sensors. Four macroscopically invariant muscle synergies, extracted through non-negative matrix factorization, proved a shared modular organization across conditions. The fine-tuning of muscle synergies was studied through non-negative matrix reconstruction, applied by fixing muscle weights or activation profiles to those of the rectilinear condition. The activation profiles tended to be recruited for a longer period and with a larger amplitude during curvilinear walking. The muscles of the posterior side of the lower limb were those mainly influenced by the fine-tuning, with the muscles inside the rotation path being more active than the outer muscles. This study shows that rectilinear and curvilinear walking share a unique motor command. However, a fine-tuning in muscle synergies is introduced during curvilinear conditions, adapting the kinematic strategy to the new biomechanical needs.","Chia Bejarano, Noelia; Pedrocchi, Alessandra; Nardone, Antonio; Schieppati, Marco; Baccinelli, Walter; Monticone, Marco; Ferrigno, Giancarlo; Ferrante, Simona",Annals of biomedical engineering,231,14

Ferritin is considered a direct mediator of the immune system and some evidences suggested a shared physio-pathogenic basis between COVID-19 and ""Hyperferritinemic Syndromes"". The aim of our study was to evaluate the prognostic role of ferritin in COVID-19 patients. METHODS We retrospectively studied consecutive COVID-19 patients admitted to 4 Italian Internal Medicine Units. Role of potential prognostic markers was evaluated with binary logistic regression analysis and results were expressed as odds ratios (ORs) with the corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Poor outcome was defined as death or need to transfer in the intensive care unit. RESULTS Two hundred patients were included (mean age 68.75 ± 13.22 years). Ferritin value was ​​highly elevated (> 3000 ng/mL) in 8% of our population; 13% of patients were transferred to intensive care units and 12% of patients died. At multivariate analysis, highly elevated ferritin levels (OR 16.67 C.I. 4.89 - 57.57 p<0.001) and hemoglobin < 10 g/dL (OR 8.88 C.I. 2.02 - 39.09 p=0.004) were independently associated with a bad outcome. Patients with ferritin values > 3000 ng/ml appeared to have an inflammatory activation with elevated values of CRP and D-dimer and low values of lymphocyte count. CONCLUSION Our results confirm the prognostic role of ferritin in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Patients with high ferritin levels should be considered critically-ill and treated in an adequate setting. Furthermore, COVID-19 seems to share some characteristics with hyperferritinemic syndromes with potential therapeutic implications.","Para, Ombretta; Caruso, Lorenzo; Pestelli, Giulia; Tangianu, Flavio; Carrara, Davide; Maddaluni, Lucia; Tamburello, Antonio; Castelnovo, Laura; Fedi, Giacomo; Guidi, Stefano; Pestelli, Caterina; Pennella, Benedetta; Ciarambino, Tiziana; Nozzoli, Carlo; Dentali, Francesco",Postgraduate medicine,231,1

MATERIALS AND METHODS Thirty-nine consecutive acetabular CCC procedures were performed in 37 patients (24 M:13F, age 66 ± 8 years). Pain was assessed using a 0-10 numeric rating scale. Development of new or progression of pre-existing fractures and local tumor progression (LTP) were determined on follow-up imaging. Pain score reduction and fracture development rates were compared by ablation completeness and the presence of pre-existing fractures. RESULTS Twenty-three of 27 (85%) patients with evaluable pain scores had reduced pain, decreasing from 7.5 ± 2.1 to 3.6 ± 2.6 (p < 0.0001). Of 39 tumors, 28 (72%) were completely ablated with no significant difference in pain reduction after complete versus incomplete ablations (p = 0.9387). Six of 30 (20%) patients with follow-up imaging demonstrated new/progressive acetabular fractures. Four of 5 (80%) patients with LTP developed new/progressive fractures compared to 2 of 25 (8%) without tumor progression (p = 0.0003). Pre-existing fracture was not associated with subsequent fracture/fracture progression (p = 0.2986). However, patients with prior acetabular radiation therapy or surgery had increased fractures following treatment (p = 0.0380). CONCLUSION Complete acetabular tumor ablation during CCC was not associated with superior pain relief compared to subtotal ablation but did result in improved fracture stabilization. Pre-treatment pathologic fractures were not associated with fracture progression, but new/progressive fractures were more frequent in patients with prior radiation therapy or surgery.","Kurup, A Nicholas; Schmit, Grant D; Atwell, Thomas D; Sviggum, Erik B; Castaneda, Wilfrido R; Rose, Peter S; Callstrom, Matthew R",Cardiovascular and interventional radiology,231,31

METHODS In this prospective, observational study crSO2, peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO2), heart rate (HR) and mean arterial blood pressure (MABP) were monitored continuously for 24 h, starting within the first 6 h after birth. Furthermore, cerebral fractional tissue oxygen extraction (cFTOE) was calculated. Preterm neonates with and without arterial hypotension (MABP below the gestational age in weeks) were compared to each other. RESULTS Forty-six preterm infants could be analyzed, 17 with (33.4 ± 1.9 weeks, 2016.5 ± 548.5 g) and 29 without arterial hypotension (33.3 ± 1.3 weeks, 1924.7 ± 451.9 g). Altogether, we detected 30 episodes of hypotension, with a mean duration of 1.6 ± 1.2 h per infant and a mean decrease in MABP of 2.2 ± 0.9 mmHg. During hypotension mean crSO2 was 7 5 ± 11%, 2 h prior to that 76 ± 10% and 2 h after the hypotension 7 7 ± 10%, therefore no significant alterations could be observed. Moreover, there was no significant difference in mean 24-h crSO2, SpO2 and cFTOE between the two groups. CONCLUSION Mild short-term hypotensive episodes in preterm infants did not affect crSO2. This suggests that cerebral autoregulation is maintained in case of borderline-hypotension and may protect infants from cerebral injury.","Binder-Heschl, Corinna; Urlesberger, Berndt; Schwaberger, Bernhard; Koestenberger, Martin; Pichler, Gerhard","The journal of maternal-fetal & neonatal medicine : the official journal of the European Association of Perinatal Medicine, the Federation of Asia and Oceania Perinatal Societies, the International Society of Perinatal Obstetricians",231,31

This framework aligns and should be integrated with an existing public health pandemic intervals model. It includes six phases of a behavioral health pandemic response strategy: preplanning, response readiness, response mobilization, intervention, continuation, and amelioration. The ways behavioral health specialists can capitalize on their competence in the leadership, prevention, education, service, research, and advocacy domains within each behavioral health pandemic response phase are articulated. Behavioral health expertise can help ensure a more comprehensive, effective pandemic response that facilitates the flattening of the curve of disease spread, along with the corresponding emotional distress curve. A case illustration, the Caring Communities (CC) initiative, is offered as an exemplar of action steps in the leadership, prevention, education, service, research, and advocacy domains that behavioral health professionals can take within each of the behavioral health pandemic response phases. Key CC action steps include providing support groups, offering virtual wellness breaks, participating in educational outreach, creating and disseminating wellness guides, launching and leading a virtual behavioral health clinic for health care staff, participating in behavioral health research and program evaluation, and engaging in advocacy initiatives aimed at improving behavioral health care and addressing and reducing health disparities.

We identified four de novo heterozygous OAS1 gain-of-function variants in six patients with a polymorphic autoinflammatory immunodeficiency characterized by recurrent fever, dermatitis, inflammatory bowel disease, pulmonary alveolar proteinosis, and hypogammaglobulinemia. To establish causality, we applied genetic, molecular dynamics simulation, biochemical, and cellular functional analyses in heterologous, autologous, and inducible pluripotent stem cell-derived macrophages and/or monocytes and B cells. We found that upon interferon-induced expression, OAS1 variant proteins displayed dsRNA-independent activity, which resulted in RNase L-mediated RNA cleavage, transcriptomic alteration, translational arrest, and dysfunction and apoptosis of monocytes, macrophages, and B cells. RNase L inhibition with curcumin modulated and allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation cured the disorder.

However, long-term follow-up of weight loss and comorbidity are yet to be available. Theoretical advantages include reduced fistula rate, no implantable device, preservation of the alimentary pathway, and no gastric resection. We report a case-control study comparing short-term outcome in two groups of patients who had either LGP or LSG, respectively. METHODS From January 2012 to June 2013, 40 patients had LGP, matched with 40 patients who had LSG. RESULTS No postoperative mortality was observed. Overall morbidity rate reached 22.5 % in the LGP Group and 10 % in the LSG Group (P = 0.04). The most common complication was nausea and vomiting occurring in 20 % of patients with LGP and 5 % of patients with LSG, respectively (P < 0.001). No clinical or radiological leak occurred. Mean operative time was 91.5 ±18.6 min in the LGP group and 81 min ±16.8 min in the LSG group, respectively (P = 0.104). Mean hospital stay was 3.4 ±1.1 days in the LGP Group and 3.2 ±1.2 days the LSG group, respectively (P = 0.614). Average total operating room (OR) cost was 1736 euros for LGP as compared to 2842 euros for LSG, respectively (P < 0.001).

METHODS Brain death was induced by slow intracranial blood infusion in anesthetized pigs after randomization to placebo (n = 11) or to methylprednisolone (n = 8) to inhibit the expression of pro-inflammatory mediators. Pulmonary artery pressure (PAP), wedged PAP (PAWP), pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) and effective pulmonary capillary pressure (PCP) were measured 1 and 5 hours after Cushing reflex. Lung tissue was sampled to determine gene expressions of cytokines and oxidative stress molecules, and pathologically score lung injury. RESULTS Intracranial hypertension caused a transient increase in blood pressure followed, after brain death was diagnosed, by persistent increases in PAP, PCP and the venous component of PVR, while PAWP did not change. Arterial PO2/fraction of inspired O2 (PaO2/FiO2) decreased. Brain death was associated with an accumulation of neutrophils and an increased apoptotic rate in lung tissue together with increased pro-inflammatory interleukin (IL)-6/IL-10 ratio and increased heme oxygenase(HO)-1 and hypoxia inducible factor(HIF)-1 alpha expression. Blood expressions of IL-6 and IL-1β were also increased. Methylprednisolone pre-treatment was associated with a blunting of increased PCP and PVR venous component, which returned to baseline 5 hours after BD, and partially corrected lung tissue biological perturbations. PaO2/FiO2 was inversely correlated to PCP and lung injury score. CONCLUSIONS Brain death-induced lung injury may be best explained by an initial excessive increase in pulmonary capillary pressure with increased pulmonary venous resistance, and was associated with lung activation of inflammatory apoptotic processes which were partially prevented by methylprednisolone.","Belhaj, Asmae; Dewachter, Laurence; Rorive, Sandrine; Remmelink, Myriam; Weynand, Birgit; Melot, Christian; Hupkens, Emeline; Dewachter, Céline; Creteur, Jacques; Mc Entee, Kathleen; Naeije, Robert; Rondelet, Benoît",PloS one,231,33

Within the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) healthcare system, two vulnerable groups include those with a psychotic disorder (PSY) and those who have recently experienced homelessness (recently housed Veterans, RHV). We conducted phone interviews with PSY (n = 81), RHV (n = 76) and control Veterans (CTL, n = 74) between mid-May - mid-August 2020 (""initial"") and between mid-August - mid-October 2020 (""follow-up""). At the initial period, we also collected retrospective ratings relative to January 2020 (""pre-COVID-19""). We assessed clinical factors (e.g., depression, anxiety, loneliness) and community integration (e.g., social and role functioning). All groups reported worse clinical outcomes after the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, PSY and RHV exhibited improvements in depression and anxiety from initial to follow up, whereas CTL continued to exhibit elevated levels. There was little change in community integration measures. Our results indicate that all groups reported increased mental health problems after the onset of the pandemic, but vulnerable Veterans were not disproportionately affected and had better mental health resilience (i.e., for depression and anxiety) as the pandemic progressed compared to CTL. This effect could be due to the availability and utilization of VA services for PSY and RHV (e.g., housing and financial support, medical and mental health services), which may have helped to mitigate the impact of the pandemic.","Wynn, Jonathan K; McCleery, Amanda; Novacek, Derek; Reavis, Eric A; Tsai, Jack; Green, Michael F",Journal of psychiatric research,231,1

The biosensor involves a disposable carbon electrode substrate doubly nanostructured with reduced graphene oxide (rGO) and AuNPs modified with pyrene carboxylic acid (PCA) and 6-ferrocenylhexanethiol (Fc-SH), respectively. A synthetic amino terminated DNA capture probe was covalently immobilized on the CO2H moieties of PCA/rGO, while Fc-SH was used as a signaling molecule. Differential pulse voltammetry was employed to record the decrease in the oxidation peak current of Fc after the hybridization due to the hindering of the electron transfer upon the formation of the DNA-RNA duplex on the electrode surface. The stepwise biosensor preparation was characterized by surface and electrochemical techniques showing the role played by each biosensor component as well as the reliability of the target miRNA determination. The determination of the oncogene miRNA-21 synthetic target allowed quantification in the low femtomolar range (LOD of 5 fM) with a high discrimination of single-base mismatched sequences in a single 30-min incubation step.

During neurotropic coronavirus JHMV infection, infiltration of protective ASC occurs after T cell-mediated viral control and is preceded by accumulation of non-isotype-switched IgD+ and IgM+ B cells. However, the contribution of peripheral activation events in cervical lymph nodes (CLN) to driving humoral immune responses in the infected CNS is poorly defined. CD19, a signaling component of the B cell receptor complex, is one of multiple regulators driving B cell differentiation and germinal center (GC) formation by lowering the threshold of antigen-driven activation. JHMV-infected CD19-/- mice were thus used to determine how CD19 affects CNS recruitment of B cell subsets. Early polyclonal ASC expansion, GC formation, and virus-specific ASC were all significantly impaired in CLN of CD19-/- mice compared to wild-type (WT) mice, consistent with lower and unsustained virus-specific serum antibody (Ab). ASC were also significantly reduced in the CNS, resulting in increased infectious virus during persistence. Nevertheless, CD19 deficiency did not affect early CNS IgD+ B cell accumulation. The results support the notion that CD19-independent factors drive early B cell mobilization and recruitment to the infected CNS, while delayed accumulation of virus-specific, isotype-switched ASC requires CD19-dependent GC formation in CLN. CD19 is thus essential for both sustained serum Ab and protective local Ab within the CNS following JHMV encephalomyelitis.IMPORTANCE CD19 activation is known to promote GC formation and to sustain serum Ab responses following antigen immunization and viral infections. However, the contribution of CD19 in the context of CNS infections has not been evaluated. This study demonstrates that antiviral protective ASC in the CNS are dependent on CD19 activation and peripheral GC formation, while accumulation of early-recruited IgD+ B cells is CD19 independent. This indicates that IgD+ B cells commonly found early in the CNS do not give rise to local ASC differentiation and that only antigen-primed, peripheral GC-derived ASC infiltrate the CNS, thereby limiting potentially harmful nonspecific Ab secretion. Expanding our understanding of activation signals driving CNS migration of distinct B cell subsets during neuroinflammatory insults is critical for preventing and managing acute encephalitic infections, as well as preempting reactivation of persistent viruses during immune-suppressive therapies targeting B cells in multiple sclerosis (MS), such as rituximab and ocrelizumab.","Atkinson, Jeffrey R; Bergmann, Cornelia C",Journal of virology,231,24

Our objective was to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis examining the benefits of high-flow nasal cannula in the peri-intubation period. DATA SOURCES We performed a comprehensive search of relevant databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Web of Science). STUDY SELECTION We included randomized clinical trials that compared high-flow nasal cannula to other noninvasive oxygen delivery systems in the peri-intubation period. DATA EXTRACTION Our primary outcome was severe desaturation (defined as peripheral oxygen saturation reading < 80% during intubation). Secondary outcomes included peri-intubation complications, apneic time, PaO2 before and after intubation, PaCO2 after intubation, ICU length of stay, and short-term mortality. DATA SYNTHESIS We included 10 randomized clinical trials (n = 1,017 patients). High-flow nasal cannula had no effect on the occurrence rate of peri-intubation hypoxemia (relative risk, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.68-1.42; 0.3% absolute risk reduction, moderate certainty), serious complications (relative risk, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.71-1.06), apneic time (mean difference, 10.3 s higher with high-flow nasal cannula; 95% CI, 11.0 s lower to 31.7 s higher), PaO2 measured after preoxygenation (mean difference, 3.6 mm Hg higher; 95% CI, 3.5 mm Hg lower to 10.7 mm Hg higher), or PaO2 measured after intubation (mean difference, 27.0 mm Hg higher; 95% CI, 13.2 mm Hg lower to 67.2 mm Hg higher), when compared with conventional oxygen therapy. There was also no effect on postintubation PaCO2, ICU length of stay, or 28-day mortality. CONCLUSIONS We found moderate-to-low certainty evidence that the use of high-flow nasal cannula likely has no effect on severe desaturation, serious complications, apneic time, oxygenation, ICU length of stay, or overall survival when used in the peri-intubation period when compared with conventional oxygen therapy.","Chaudhuri, Dipayan; Granton, David; Wang, Dominic Xiang; Einav, Sharon; Helviz, Yigal; Mauri, Tommaso; Ricard, Jean-Damien; Mancebo, Jordi; Frat, Jean-Pierre; Jog, Sameer; Hernandez, Gonzalo; Maggiore, Salvatore M; Hodgson, Carol; Jaber, Samir; Brochard, Laurent; Burns, Karen E A; Rochwerg, Bram",Critical care medicine,231,30

Instead, at sub-domain-size resolution and because of physical constraints not necessarily requiring evolution to shape polypeptide chains, networks of protein motifs depict a continuous view that lies beyond the extent of hierarchical classification schemes. A number of studies, however, suggest that universal sub-sequences could be the descendants of peptides emerged in an ancient pre-biotic world. Should this be the case, evolutionary signals retained by structurally conserved motifs, along with hierarchical features of ancient domains, could sew relationships among folds that diverged beyond the point where homology is discernable. In view of the aforementioned, this paper provides a rationale where a network with hierarchical and continuous levels of the protein space, together with sequence profiles that probe the extent of sequence similarity and contacting residues that capture the transition from pre-biotic to domain world, has been used to explore relationships between ancient folds. Statistics of detected signals have been reported. As a result, an example of an emergent sub-network that makes sense from an evolutionary perspective, where conserved signals retrieved from the assessed protein space have been co-opted, has been discussed.","Gullotto, Danilo",Statistical applications in genetics and molecular biology,231,1

Social media have emerged as a major means of human communication. However, a major limitation in such media is the lack of non-verbal stimuli, which sometimes hinders the understanding of the message, and in particular the associated emotional content. In an effort to compensate for this, people started to use emoticons, which are combinations of keyboard characters that resemble facial expressions, and more recently their evolution: emojis, namely, small colorful images that resemble faces, actions and daily life objects. This paper presents evidence of the effect of emojis on memory retrieval through a functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) study. A total number of fifteen healthy volunteers were recruited for the experiment, during which successive stimuli were presented, containing words with intense emotional content combined with emojis, either with congruent or incongruent emotional content. Volunteers were asked to recall a memory related to the stimulus. The study of the reaction times showed that emotional incongruity among word+emoji combinations led to longer reaction times in memory retrieval compared to congruent combinations. General Linear Model (GLM) and Blind Source Separation (BSS) methods have been tested in assessing the influence of the emojis on the process of memory retrieval. The analysis of the fMRI data showed that emotional incongruity among word+emoji combinations activated the Broca's area (BA44 and BA45) in both hemispheres, the Supplementary Motor Area (SMA) and the inferior prefrontal cortex (BA47), compared to congruent combinations. Furthermore, compared to pseudowords, word+emoji combinations activated the left Broca's area (BA44 and BA45), the amygdala, the right temporal pole (BA48) and several frontal regions including the SMA and the inferior prefrontal cortex.","Chatzichristos, Christos; Morante, Manuel; Andreadis, Nikolaos; Kofidis, Eleftherios; Kopsinis, Yiannis; Theodoridis, Sergios",PloS one,231,1

We compared corticospinal excitability and motor representation assessed with transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) between long-term resistance trained (LRT, ≥3 years) vs untrained (UNT) males (n=15/group). Motor-evoked potentials (MEPs) were obtained from the biceps brachii during isometric elbow flexion. Stimulus-response curves were created at the hotspot during 10% maximum voluntary torque (MVT) contractions. Maximum peak-to-peak MEP amplitude (MEPmax) was acquired with 100% stimulator output intensity whilst 25-100% MVT was produced. Maps were created during 10% MVT contractions, with an individualised TMS intensity eliciting 20% MEPmax at the hotspot. LRT had a 48% lower stimulus-response curve slope than UNT (P<0.05). LRT also had a 66% larger absolute map size, although TMS intensity used for mapping was greater in LRT vs UNT (48% vs 26% above active motor threshold) to achieve a target 20% MEPmax at the hotspot, due to the lower slope of LRT. Map size was strongly correlated with the TMS intensity used for mapping (r=0.776, P<0.001). Once map size was normalised to TMS intensity, there was no difference between the groups (P=0.683). We conclude that LRT had a lower stimulus-response curve slope/excitability, suggesting higher neural efficiency. TMS map size was overwhelmingly determined by TMS intensity, even when the MEP response at the hotspot was matched among individuals, likely due to larger current spread with higher intensities. Motor representation appears similar between LRT and UNT given no difference in the normalised map size.","Maeo, Sumiaki; Balshaw, Thomas G; Lanza, Marcel B; Hannah, Ricci; Folland, Jonathan P",The European journal of neuroscience,231,33

METHODS A retrospective analysis of the 2013-2016 North American Contact Dermatitis Group data was conducted. The study group consisted of patients with final interpretation of ""allergic"" to either DPG or CM. Reactions coded as irritant or doubtful/macular erythema (+/- and not interpreted as allergic) were excluded. RESULTS A total of 10,457 patients were patch tested to both CM and DPG, and 610 (5.8%) had allergic reactions to either CM or DPG (CM only [n = 292, 47.9%], DPG only [n = 190, 31.1%], both [n = 128, 21.0%]). A total of 39.4% of CM-allergic patients reacted to DPG, and 59.7% of DPG-allergic patients reacted to CM. Analyses found that 25% (++/+++ subgroup) to 40% (all patients) of allergic reactions to DPG would have been missed by testing to CM alone. More than 70% of reactions to CM and DPG were +/- or +.

These genetic changes can accumulate in the descendants as a result of natural selection. Using phylogeny and genome comparisons, evolutionary paths can be somehow retraced, with recent events being much easier to detect than older ones. For this reason, multiple tools are available to study the evolutionary events within genomes of single species, such as gene composition alterations, or subtler mutations such as SNPs. However, these tools are generally designed to compare similar genomes and require advanced skills in bioinformatics. We present CAPRIB, a unique tool developed in Java that allows to determine the amino acid changes, at the genus level, that correlate with phenotypic differences between two groups of organisms. RESULTS CAPRIB has a user-friendly graphical interface and uses databases in SQL, making it easy to compare several genomes without the need for programming or thorough knowledge in bioinformatics. This intuitive software narrows down a list of amino acid changes that are concomitant with a given phenotypic divergence at the genus scale. Each permutation found by our software is associated with two already described statistical values that indicate its potential impact on the protein's function, helping the user decide which promising candidates to further investigate. We show that CAPRIB is able to detect already known mutations and uncovers many more, and that this tool can be used to question molecular phylogeny. Finally, we exemplify the utility of CAPRIB by pinpointing amino acid changes that coincided with the emergence of slow-growing mycobacteria from their fast-growing counterparts. The software is freely available at https://github.com/BactSymEvol/Caprib . CONCLUSIONS CAPRIB is a new bioinformatics software aiming to make genus-scale comparisons accessible to all. With its intuitive graphical interface, this tool identifies key amino acid changes concomitant with a phenotypic divergence. By comparing fast and slow-growing mycobacteria, we shed light on evolutionary hotspots, such as the cytokinin pathway, that are interesting candidates for further experimentations.","Guerra Maldonado, Juan F; Vincent, Antony T; Chenal, Martin; Veyrier, Frederic J",BMC genomics,231,28

MCR-3 generally mediates low-level (≤8 mg L-1 ) colistin resistance among Enterobacteriaceae, but occasionally confers high-level (>128 mg L-1 ) resistance in aeromonads. Herein, it is determined that MCR-3, together with another lipid A modification mediated by the arnBCADTEF operon, may be responsible for high-level colistin resistance in aeromonads. Lipid A is the critical site of pathogens for Toll-like receptor 4 recognizing. However, it is unknown whether or how MCR-3-mediated lipid A modification affects the host immune response. Compared with the wild-type strains, increased mortality is observed in mice intraperitoneally-infected with mcr-3-positive Aeromonas salmonicida and Escherichia coli strains, along with sepsis symptoms. Further, mcr-3-positive strains show decreased clearance rates than wild-type strains, leading to bacterial accumulation in organs. The increased mortality is tightly associated with the increased tissue hypoxia, injury, and post-inflammation. MCR-3 expression also impairs phagocytosis efficiency both in vivo and in vitro, contributing to the increased persistence of mcr-3-positive bacteria in tissues compared with parental strains.

STUDY DESIGN Post hoc analysis of a double-blind, placebo-controlled, enriched enrollment, randomized withdrawal trial evaluating pregabalin in 99 patients with NP who completed the PQAS, which comprises 20 questions regarding individual pain domains and qualities that are scored into three scales: paroxysmal, deep, and surface. METHODS Patients rated the average pain intensity and pain quality using the PQAS at baseline; average pain intensity was assessed again after 40 days of treatment with pregabalin. Associations between pretreatment PQAS scores and treatment response were estimated using Pearson's r. Logistic regression was used to identify pretitration PQAS scores contributing unique variance to predicting treatment response. RESULTS Fifty participants provided baseline PQAS scores and received pregabalin for the entire length of the study. Nine of 23 PQAS baseline scales and items were significantly associated with treatment response to pregabalin: the paroxysmal and deep scales, and the items assessing the following pain domains and qualities: intensity, electric, tingling, cramping, radiating, throbbing, and deep (P values range, 0.002-0.045; rs range, 0.28-0.43). The PQAS items assessing sharp, hot, and unpleasant pain items demonstrated nonsignificant trends (P < 0.10) to be associated with treatment response. In the logistic regression analysis, pretitration PQAS scores had 77% sensitivity and 83% specificity to correctly identify pregabalin responders. Significantly correlated PQAS items had a sensitivity of 85% and specificity of 76%.

A total of 113 children who had household contact with cases of varicella, hepatitis A, or mumps were enrolled. Secondary attack rate (SAR) was lower in hepatitis A (43.3%) than those for varicella (75.0%) and mumps (65.3%) (p<0.05). Rate of secondary asymptomatic infections was 25.6% in the hepatitis A group, 3.1% in the varicella group, and 16.6% in the mumps group. Positive predictive value (PPV) of the history was 100% for all 3 diseases and negative predictive value (NPV) was 85% for hepatitis A, 80.0% for varicella, and 56.2% for mumps. In conclusion, asymptomatic infections are important in the calculation of SARs in household contacts. PPV and NPV of medical history taken from parents might be useful when deciding the need for vaccination.","Ceyhan, Mehmet; Tezer, Hasan; Yildirim, Inci",Scandinavian journal of infectious diseases,231,16

Remote learning was created, seemingly overnight, clerkships were disrupted, licensing examinations were cancelled, teaching faculty were redeployed, student volunteers rallied, and everyone was required to shelter at home. Seismic changes were required to adapt the authors' educational programs to a constantly evolving, unpredictable, and ever-worsening public health crisis. Entirely new communication strategies were adopted and thousands of decisions had to be made, often with little time to carefully reflect on the consequences of those decisions. What allowed each school to navigate these treacherous waters was a set of guiding principles that were used to ground each conversation, and inform every decision. While the language varied somewhat between schools, the core principles were universal and framed a way forward at a time when information, data, precedent, and best practices did not exist. The authors share these guiding principles in the hope that colleagues at other medical schools will find them to be a useful framework as we all continue to cope with the impact of COVID-19 on the future of medical education.","Muller, David; Parkas, Valerie; Amiel, Jonathan; Anand, Shashi; Cassese, Todd; Cunningham, Tara; Kang, Yoon; Nosanchuk, Joshua; Soriano, Rainier; Zbar, Lori; Karani, Reena",Medical teacher,231,7

Ischemic injury should be minimized because it impacts renal function outcomes following partial nephrectomy. Herein, the authors detail the technique and present initial perioperative outcomes of our novel harmonic scalpel ""drilling and clamping"" method to implement zero-ischemic RAPN. The authors prospectively collected baseline and perioperative data of patients who underwent zero ischemic RAPN performed by our harmonic scalpel ""drilling and clamping"" method. From April 2012 to December 2014, a total of 19 consecutive zero ischemic RAPN procedures were performed by a single surgeon. For 18 of the 19 patients, RAPN using our harmonic scalpel ""Drilling and Clamping"" method was successfully completed without the need for hilar clamping. The median tumor size was 3.4 cm (range: 1.8-6.2); operative time was 3.2 hours (range: 1.9-4.5); blood loss was 100 mL (range: 30-950); and postoperative hospital stay was 4 days (3-26). One patient required intraoperative blood transfusion. Two patients had intra or postoperative complications: 1 was converted to traditional laparotomy because of massive bleeding, whereas another had postoperative stress ulcer. Pathology confirmed renal cell carcinoma in 13 patients (63.2%), angiomyolipoma in 6 patients: (31.5%), and oncocytoma in 1 patient (5.3%).

Passive leg raising (PLR) is a validated dynamic method to induce a transient increase in cardiac preload and predict fluid responsiveness. Variations in end-tidal carbon dioxide (ETCO2) obtained by capnography correlate closely with variations in cardiac output when alveolar ventilation and carbon dioxide production are kept constant. In this prospective observational study, we tested the hypothesis that variations in ETCO2 induced by a simplified PLR maneuver can track changes in the cardiac index (CI) and thus predict fluid responsiveness. METHOD A five-minute standardized PLR maneuver was performed in 90 paralyzed hemodynamically stable cardiac surgical patients receiving mechanical ventilation. Cardiac index was measured by thermodilution before and one minute after PLR. End-tidal CO2 measurements using capnography were obtained during the entire PLR maneuver. Fluid responsiveness was defined as a 15% increase in the CI. The Chi square test and Student's t test were used to compare responders and non-responders. Logistic regression analyses were then performed to determine factors of responsiveness. RESULTS There were no differences between responders and non-responders in demographic and baseline hemodynamic variables. Fluid responsiveness was associated with an ETCO2 variation (ΔETCO2) of ≥ 2 mmHg during PLR [odds ratio (OR), 7.3; 95% confidence interval (CI), 2.7 to 20.2; P < 0.01; sensitivity 75%]. A low positive predictive value (54%) and a high negative predictive value (NPV) (86%) were observed. No other clinical or hemodynamic predictors were associated with fluid responsiveness. A logistic regression model established that a combination of ΔETCO2 ≥ 2 mmHg and a change in systolic blood pressure ≥ 10 mmHg induced by passive leg raising was predictive of fluid responsiveness (OR, 8.9; 95% CI, 2.5 to 32.2; P = 0.005). CONCLUSION Use of a passive leg raising maneuver to induce variation in ETCO2 is a noninvasive and useful method to assess fluid responsiveness in paralyzed cardiac surgery patients receiving mechanical ventilation. Given its high NPV, fluid responsiveness is unlikely if a passive leg raising maneuver induces ΔETCO2 of < 2 mmHg.","Toupin, Francis; Clairoux, Ariane; Deschamps, Alain; Lebon, Jean-Sébastien; Lamarche, Yoan; Lambert, Jean; Fortier, Annik; Denault, André Y",Canadian journal of anaesthesia = Journal canadien d'anesthesie,231,1

METHODS Seven prostheses (four with absorbable barriers and 3 with nonabsorbable barriers) were evaluated. The barrier layer was removed, after which the area of the interstices and the diameter of the filaments were determined. The barrier layer was left intact during thickness, density, suture retention strength, tear resistance, uniaxial tensile, and ball-burst testing. Specimens were oriented parallel or perpendicular to their longest dimension during testing. One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with Tukey's posttest or an unpaired, two-tailed t-test was performed to determine whether differences existed due to mesh or orientation, and a p value<0.05 was considered significant. RESULTS Significant differences were observed between mesh types and due to the orientation of the mesh during testing. Of the absorbable barrier meshes, Bard Sepramesh IP Composite demonstrated the greatest suture retention and tear strengths, followed by C-QUR mesh. Of the permanent barrier meshes, DUALMESH demonstrated the greatest suture retention strength in the perpendicular direction, followed by Bard Composix E/X. DUALMESH and Bard Composix E/X demonstrated equivalent suture retention strength in the parallel direction and equivalent tear resistance in both testing directions. All meshes demonstrated tensile strengths greater than the physiologically relevant range of 16-32 N/cm. CONCLUSIONS This study provided a basic understanding of how the structural aspects of each mesh design influence functionality. Differences between composite barrier prostheses commonly used for LVHR were observed due to barrier type, mesh type, and orientation. A set of standard testing techniques and a classification system also were presented to define fully the properties of these materials.","Deeken, Corey R; Abdo, Michael S; Frisella, Margaret M; Matthews, Brent D",Surgical endoscopy,231,1

Yet, poor dietary habits are common in young children, who often consume diets that are not aligned with dietary recommendations. Early childhood education and care (ECEC) is a recommended setting to deliver healthy eating interventions as they offer existing infrastructure and access to a large number of children. This protocol aims to describe the methods of a systematic review to assess the effectiveness of healthy eating interventions conducted within the ECEC setting to improve child diet. METHODS AND ANALYSIS Eight electronic databases including Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Ovid MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL Complete, PsycINFO, ERIC, SCOPUS, and SPORTDiscus will be searched from conception to March 2020. Randomised controlled trials (RCT) of dietary interventions targeting children aged up to 6 years conducted within the ECEC setting (including pre-schools, kindergartens, long day care, and family day care) will be included in the review. The primary review outcome is any measure of child dietary intake. Secondary outcomes include (i) child anthropometrics, (ii) child cognition, (iii) child mental health, (iv) child quality of life, (v) the absolute cost or cost-effectiveness of included interventions, and (vi) any reported adverse effects. Study inclusion, data extraction, and risk of bias assessments will be performed independently by two reviewers. Meta-analyses will be performed if adequate data is available, else review findings will be described narratively. DISCUSSION This systematic review seeks to synthesise the effectiveness of healthy eating interventions conducted within the ECEC setting for improving child diet. This review will also seek to describe the effect of ECEC-based healthy eating interventions on a variety of important secondary outcomes (adverse events and cost-effectiveness) that will enhance the public health policy and practice relevance of review findings.

Gynaecologists-obstetricians have a key role in this legislation, particularly through the prescription of preventive leave for patients who would otherwise face dangerous or arduous tasks in the absence of an adequate risk analysis or suitable protective measures. However, international and national literature suggests that gynaecologists-obstetricians may encounter difficulties in fulfilling their role. AIMS This study aimed to: (1) describe the practices and difficulties encountered by gynaecologists-obstetricians in the practical implementation of the OProMa; and (2) compare the evolution of these practices and difficulties between 2008 and 2017. METHODS A survey by questionnaire was conducted in 2008 and repeated in 2017. Both surveys focused on gynaecologists-obstetricians working in the French-speaking part of Switzerland (in private practices, hospitals or both). Descriptive and comparative analyses were carried out. RESULTS 83 gynaecologists-obstetricians responded in 2008 and 93 in 2017: response rates of 47% and 32%, respectively. In 2017, gynaecologists-obstetricians were more likely to ask questions about occupational risks faced by their patients when consulted by working mothers about their pregnancies. The estimated percentage of patients exposed to an occupational risk remained constant (20% in 2008 and 22% in 2017). Communication and collaboration with employers were reported to be difficult in both surveys, even though these are key elements in the implementation of the OProMa. Collaboration with occupational physicians, however, was more frequent in 2017. CONCLUSION In 2017, gynaecologists-obstetricians showed a greater awareness of occupational risks and collaborated more frequently with occupational health specialists. However, the application of the OProMa remained limited over the studied time period. Improving training of gynaecologists-obstetricians in this field could be a significant factor in encouraging better implementation of the current legislation. Moreover, gynaecologists-obstetricians need to be given the necessary support to enable their clinical practice to evolve towards a more preventive type of medicine. Collaboration with relevant stakeholders, including occupational physicians, midwives and workers, should be encouraged.","Abderhalden-Zellweger, Alessia; Mediouni, Zakia; Probst, Isabelle; Politis Mercier, Maria-Pia; Danuser, Brigitta; Wild, Pascal; Chiarini, Bastien; Hale, Marie-Louise; Krief, Peggy",Swiss medical weekly,231,1

Here, we detail how laparoscopic total colectomy can be safely performed within the constraints of such single site operating. METHODS Three patients (2 males and 1 female; mean age, 28.3 y; mean body mass index, 24.1 kg/m) requiring urgent total colectomy with end ileostomy for colitis resistant to medical therapy fully consented to have their operation performed by a single-port laparoscopic approach. The single port was placed at the site marked preoperatively for the end ileostomy. The operation commenced with rectosigmoid transection and proceeded with a close pericolic dissection proximally along the colon to the cecum. The resected colon was withdrawn via the port site and the end ileostomy fashioned within this wound. RESULTS The operation was safely completed in its entirety without additional abdominal access in each case. Mean operative time was 206 minutes. All patients are well with normal stoma appearance and function at a minimum follow-up of 4 months. CONCLUSION Judicious patient selection and considered operative technique allow major resectional colonic surgery to be safely performed solely by a single-port technique. Proof of clinical benefit along with refined instrumentation is required if such surgery is to progress from anecdotal reports to mainstream practice.","Cahill, Ronan A; Lindsey, Ian; Jones, Oliver; Guy, Richard; Mortensen, Neil; Cunningham, Chris",Diseases of the colon and rectum,231,29

RECENT FINDINGS Nasal epithelial repair and remodeling is a highly organized and well coordinated process, involving inflammation, proliferation, differentiation, matrix deposition, and remodeling, and is regulated by a wide variety of growth factors and cytokines. From the in-vivo and in-vitro studies conducted in both human and animal models, undifferentiated basal cells (progenitors) are able to migrate from adjacent epithelium, spread over the denuded basement membrane, and proliferate in injured regions (self-renewal) in necessary (homeostasis) or excessive (hyperplasia) degree. Progenitor cells reorient to an apical-basal polarity, and progressively differentiate into ciliated and nonciliated columnar cells and goblet cells, reconstituting a functional respiratory epithelium after several weeks. This recovery process can be observed during various types and severity of injury, and also in common nasal diseases, including acute viral, allergic, and nonallergic rhinitis, as well as chronic rhinosinusitis with and without nasal polyps. SUMMARY Although nearly 10 000 articles about nasal epithelium have been published in the last decade, the mechanisms underlying the nasal epithelial repair are still understood at only a superficial descriptive level. In order to advance rhinology to the next level of a comprehensive knowledge of the orchestrated genetic and molecular processes acting during epithelial repair, combined clinical and experimental studies using sophisticated investigational plans to elucidate the functions of both the protein-coding and regulatory portions of the human genome are required.","Yan, Yan; Gordon, William M; Wang, De-Yun",Current opinion in otolaryngology & head and neck surgery,231,31

METHODS The clinical data of 75 patients with severe or critical COVID-19 in Honghu People's Hospital from January to March in 2020 were collected. RESULTS Of the 75 patients with COVID-19 pneumonia, 41 were male (54.67%) and 34 were female (45.33%) with a mean age of 67.53 ±12.37 years; 43 patients had severe and 32 had critical COVID-19, and 49.3% of the patients had underlying diseases. The main clinical manifestations included fever (78.67%) and coughing (70.67%). Compared with the severe patients, the critically ill patients had higher proportions of patients over 60 years old with elevated white blood cell count, increased prothrombin time, and higher levels of hsCRP, PCT, D-dimer, ALT, LDH, cTnI and NT-proBNP. Univariate logistic regression analysis showed that an age over 60 years, leukocytosis, hs-CRP elevation, prolonged prothrombin time, and increased levels of D-dimer, NT-proBNP and cTnI were associated with severe COVID-19. Multivariate logistic regression showed that an age over 60 years (OR=8.165, 95% CI: 1.483-45.576, P=0.017), prolonged prothrombin time (OR=7.516, 95% CI: 2.568-21.998, P=0.006) and elevated NT-proBNP (OR=6.194, 95% CI: 1.305-29.404, P=0.022) were independent risk factors for critical type of COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS An age over 60 years, a prolonged prothrombin time and elevated NT-proBNP level are important clinical features of critically ill patients with COVID-19, and can be deemed as early warning signals for critical conditions of the disease.","Xie, Weidang; Zhu, Shijie; Liu, Yanan; Bai, Yujia; Fu, Weijun; Chen, Hui; Chen, Zhongqing; Zhang, Jianwu",Nan fang yi ke da xue xue bao = Journal of Southern Medical University,231,1

Initial therapy aims at eliminating known risk factors including smoking, Helicobacter pylori infection, use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and inhibition of gastric acid secretion. While this approach is successful in 68 to 88% of the cases, up to one third of patients need a subsequent surgical revision. However, marginal ulcers still recur in up to 10% of cases after revisional surgery, thus constituting a serious challenge for bariatric surgeons. CASE PRESENTATION We herein report a case of an insidious marginal ulcer refractory to both medical therapy with high-dosed proton pump inhibitors and sucralfate as well as surgical therapy consisting of the lengthening of a short alimentary limb and later resection of the gastroenterostomy and construction of a new tension-free anastomosis. Only after gastrectomy by laparoscopic en-bloc resection of the gastrojejunostomy, the gastric pouch and resection of the gastric remnant with reconstruction by esophagojejunostomy the patient remained free of symptoms. CONCLUSION By laparoscopic resection of the entire gastric pouch and the gastric remnant the risk to leave a suboptimally vascularised or even ischemic pouch in situ was avoided. The esophagojejunostomy was then created in healthy, good vascularised tissue. In our case this novel approach was effective in the management of a refractory anastomotic ulcer and might represent a rescue option when simple revision of the gastrojejunostomy fails.","Steinemann, Daniel C; Schiesser, Marc; Clavien, Pierre-Alain; Nocito, Antonio",BMC surgery,231,6

The articles were grouped into four main categories: decision aids and outcome predictors, electrical cardioversion-based protocols, antiarrhythmic-based protocols, and general management protocols. Conclusion This systematic review is the first study to our knowledge to evaluate the optimal management of symptomatic AF/AFLin the ED with a direct impact on ED disposition. There are several viable management strategies that can result in safe discharge from the ED in the right patient population, and decision aids can be utilized to guide selection of appropriate patients for discharge.","Vandermolen, Justin L; Sadaf, Murrium I; Gehi, Anil K",Journal of atrial fibrillation,231,31

Damage to SCN structure alters circadian behavioral and hormonal rhythms and interferes with a regular sleep-wake pattern. Several studies have shown that, in aging and in Alzheimer's disease (AD), circadian rhythms change their synchronization with the environment and behavior loses sync with light. OBJECTIVE The current overview aims to examine research studies showing the effect of bright light therapy (BLT) on sleep disorders and sleep-wake patterns in AD. METHODS A literature search was conducted, taking into consideration the relevant studies over the last 20 years. Fifteen studies have been thorough: seven followed an environmental-architectural approach and eight followed a treatment devices approach. RESULTS Studies agree in considering BLT as a promising non-pharmacological intervention to compensate for circadian rhythm alterations and they support the need for standardized protocols that allow a comparison between multicenter studies. CONCLUSION Interestingly, in an attempt to contain the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic, health authorities have forced the population to stay home. Therefore, AD people are not currently able to enjoy exposure to sunlight. It is predictable that they may experience an exacerbation of circadian disturbances and that the BLT can be an effective response to prevent such exacerbation.","Roccaro, Ilaria; Smirni, Daniela",Journal of Alzheimer's disease : JAD,231,0

Otolaryngology Head and Neck Surgery is one of the most engaged disciplines, and otolaryngology specialists are facing a radical change of their role and daily activities that will have severe impact on the return to the ordinary. In this paper, the COVID-19 Task Force of the Young Otolaryngologists of the Italian Society of Otolaryngology comment on the changes that occurred for otolaryngology in Italy during the pandemic. Changes include organizational rearrangement of Otolaryngology Units, with merges and closures that affected a significant portion of them; reallocation of otolaryngology personnel, mainly to COVID-19 wards; reduction of elective clinical and surgical activity, that was mainly limited to oncology and emergency procedures; and execution of screening procedures for SARS-CoV-2 among healthcare providers and patients in otolaryngology units in Italy.","Ralli, M; Mannelli, G; Bonali, M; Capasso, P; Guarino, P; Iannini, V; Mevio, N; Russo, G; Scarpa, A; Spinato, G; Topazio, D; Molteni, G",European review for medical and pharmacological sciences,231,19

Methods We performed a retrospective study of patients admitted with COVID-19 and evaluated outcomes in those with and without COPD and/or emphysema. Patients were identified as having COPD if they had a diagnosis in the medical record and a history of airflow-obstruction on spirometry, or a history of tobacco use and prescribed long-acting bronchodilator(s). Computed tomography scans were evaluated by radiologists. Propensity matching was performed for age, body-mass index (BMI), and serologic data correlated with severity of COVID-19 disease (D-dimer, C-reactive protein, ferritin, fibrinogen, absolute lymphocyte count, lymphocyte percentage, and lactate dehydrogenase). Results Of 577 patients admitted with COVID-19, 103 had a diagnosis of COPD and/or emphysema. The COPD/emphysema cohort was older (67 vs 58, p<0.0001) than the other cohort and had a lower BMI. Among unmatched cohorts those with COPD/emphysema had higher rates of intensive care unit (ICU) admission (35% vs 24.9%, p=0.036) and maximal respiratory support requirements, with more frequent invasive mechanical ventilation (21.4% vs 11.8%), but no significant difference in mortality. After propensity-matching there was no difference in ICU admission, maximal respiratory support requirements, or mortality. Univariate and multivariate regression analyses yielded similar results. Discussion Our propensity-matched retrospective cohort study suggests that patients hospitalized with COVID-19 that have COPD and/or emphysema may not have worse outcomes than those without these comorbid conditions.","Marron, Robert M; Zheng, Matthew; Fernandez Romero, Gustavo; Zhao, Huaqing; Patel, Raj; Leopold, Ian; Thomas, Ashanth; Standiford, Taylor; Kumaran, Maruti; Patlakh Jeffrey Stewart, Nicole; Criner, Gerard J",Chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases,231,16

With the aim of extending the Anxiety Buffer Disruption Theory (ABDT), in this paper we argue that high levels of burnout may disrupt the anxiety buffer functioning that protects people from death concerns. ABDT was developed from Terror Management Theory (TMT). According to TMT, reminders of one's mortality are an essential part of humans' daily experience and have the potential to awake paralyzing fear and anxiety. In order to cope with death concerns, people typically activate an anxiety-buffering system centered on their cultural worldview and self-esteem. Recent ABDT research shows that individuals with post-traumatic stress disorder are unable to activate such anxiety buffering defenses. In line with these results, we hypothesized that the burnout syndrome may have similar effects, and that individuals with higher levels of burnout will be less likely to activate an anxiety buffering response when their mortality is made salient. Participants were 418 nurses, who completed a questionnaire including: a mortality salience (MS) manipulation, a delay manipulation, and measures of burnout, work-related self-efficacy, and representation of oneself as a valuable caregiver. Nurses are daily exposed both to the risk of burnout and to mortality reminders, and thus constituted an ideal population for this study. In line with an anxiety buffer disruption hypothesis, we found a significant three-way interaction between burnout, MS and delay. Participants with lower levels of burnout reported higher levels of self-efficacy and a more positive representation as caregivers in the MS condition compared to the control condition, when there was a delay between MS manipulation and the assessment of the dependent measures. The difference was non-significant for participants with higher levels of burnout. Theoretical and practical implications of findings are discussed.","Trifiletti, Elena; Pedrazza, Monica; Berlanda, Sabrina; Pyszczynski, Tom",Frontiers in psychology,231,16

METHODS Cross sectional telephone survey using random digit dialing. A total of 1010 adult Italians were interviewed by telephone between 16 and 19 February 2010. The survey instrument included demographic data, measures on risk perception, worry, trust and compliance with recommendations for pandemic influenza H1N1 2009. RESULTS Controlling for socio-demographic variables, compliance with all the recommended behaviors was associated with media trust, trust in the Ministry of Health, worry and perceived severity of illness. Perceptions that the risk of catching pandemic influenza H1N1 2009 is high, that the authorities are acting in the public's best interest in dealing with it, that the media had exaggerated the risks of catching it and that people can control their risk of catching it were associated with compliance with some recommended behaviors even after considering effects of socio-demographic characteristics.

Prospective, randomized, controlled trials remain the highest quality evidence for safety and effectiveness assessments, but, for instance, blinding may be challenging. In order to avoid bias and not confound data interpretation, the use of objective endpoints and blinding patients, study staff, core labs, and clinical endpoint committees to treatment assignment are helpful approaches. Anticipation of potential bias should be considered and planned for prospectively in a cardiovascular device trial. Prospective, single-arm studies (often referred to as registry studies) can provide additional data in some cases. They are subject to selection bias even when carefully designed; thus, they are generally not acceptable as the sole basis for pre-market approval of high risk cardiovascular devices. However, they complement the evidence base and fill the gaps unanswered by randomized trials. Registry studies present device safety and effectiveness in day-to-day clinical practice settings and detect rare adverse events in the post-market period. No single research design will be appropriate for every cardiovascular device or target patient population. The type of trial, appropriate control group, and optimal length of follow-up will depend on the specific device, its potential clinical benefits, the target patient population and the existence (or lack) of effective therapies, and its anticipated risks. Continued efforts on the part of investigators, the device industry, and government regulators are needed to reach the optimal approach for evaluating the safety and performance of innovative devices for the treatment of cardiovascular disease.","Zannad, Faiez; Stough, Wendy Gattis; Piña, Ileana L; Mehran, Roxana; Abraham, William T; Anker, Stefan D; De Ferrari, Gaetano M; Farb, Andrew; Geller, Nancy L; Kieval, Robert S; Linde, Cecilia; Redberg, Rita F; Stein, Kenneth; Vincent, Alphons; Woehrle, Holger; Pocock, Stuart J",International journal of cardiology,231,4

METHODS We analyzed 855 COVID-19 patients with 52 variables. The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator regression and multivariate Cox analyses were used to screen significant factors associated with in-hospital mortality. A nomogram was established based on the variables identified by Cox regression. The performance of the model was evaluated by C-index and calibration plots. Decision curve analysis was conducted to determine the clinical utility of the nomogram. RESULTS Six variables, including neutrophil (hazard ratio [HR] 1.088, 95% confidence interval [CI] [1.0004-1.147], p < 0.001), C-reactive protein (HR 1.007, 95% CI [1.0026-1.011], p = 0.002), interleukin-6 (HR 1.001, 95% CI [1.0003-1.002], p = 0.005), D-dimer (HR 1.034, 95% CI [1.0111-1.057], p = 0.003), prothrombin time (HR 1.086, 95% CI [1.0369-1.139], p < 0.001), and myoglobin (HR 1.001, 95% CI [1.0007-1.002], p < 0.001), were identified and applied to develop a nomogram. The nomogram predicted 14-day and 28-day survival probabilities with reasonable accuracy, as assessed by the C-index (0.912) and calibration plots. Decision curve analysis showed relatively wide ranges of threshold probability, suggesting a high clinical value of the nomogram. CONCLUSION Neutrophil, C-reactive protein, interleukin-6, D-dimer, prothrombin time, and myoglobin levels were significantly correlated with in-hospital mortality of COVID-19 patients. Demonstrating satisfactory discrimination and calibration, this model could predict patient outcomes as early as on admission and might serve as a useful triage tool for clinical decision making.

S localizes on the virion surface and mediates recognition of cellular receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2)4-6. Eliciting neutralizing antibodies that block S-ACE2 interaction7-9, or indirectly prevent membrane fusion10, constitute an attractive modality for vaccine-elicited protection11. However, although prototypic S-based vaccines show promise in animal models12-14, the immunogenic properties of S in humans are poorly resolved. In this study, we characterized humoral and circulating follicular helper T cell (cTFH) immunity against spike in recovered patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). We found that S-specific antibodies, memory B cells and cTFH are consistently elicited after SARS-CoV-2 infection, demarking robust humoral immunity and positively associated with plasma neutralizing activity. Comparatively low frequencies of B cells or cTFH specific for the receptor binding domain of S were elicited. Notably, the phenotype of S-specific cTFH differentiated subjects with potent neutralizing responses, providing a potential biomarker of potency for S-based vaccines entering the clinic. Overall, although patients who recovered from COVID-19 displayed multiple hallmarks of effective immune recognition of S, the wide spectrum of neutralizing activity observed suggests that vaccines might require strategies to selectively target the most potent neutralizing epitopes.","Juno, Jennifer A; Tan, Hyon-Xhi; Lee, Wen Shi; Reynaldi, Arnold; Kelly, Hannah G; Wragg, Kathleen; Esterbauer, Robyn; Kent, Helen E; Batten, C Jane; Mordant, Francesca L; Gherardin, Nicholas A; Pymm, Phillip; Dietrich, Melanie H; Scott, Nichollas E; Tham, Wai-Hong; Godfrey, Dale I; Subbarao, Kanta; Davenport, Miles P; Kent, Stephen J; Wheatley, Adam K",Nature medicine,231,24

Similarities with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronoavirus-2 (SARS CoV-2) and the 2012 Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome led early investigators to suspect a ""cytokine storm"" resulting in an unregulated inflammatory response associated with the significant morbidity and mortality induced by SARS CoV-2. The threshold of blood cytokines necessary to qualify as a ""cytokine storm"" has yet to be defined. METHODS A literature review was conducted to identify cytokine levels released during 11 assorted clinical conditions or diseases. Weighted averages for various cytokines were calculated by multiplying the number of patients in the paper by the average concentration of each cytokine. Correlation between cytokine levels for individual conditions or diseases were assessed using Pearson correlation coefficient. RESULTS The literature was reviewed to determine blood levels of cytokines in a wide variety of clinical conditions. These conditions ranged from exercise and autoimmune disease to septic shock and therapy with chimeric antigen receptor T cells. The most frequently measured cytokine was IL-6 which ranged from 24,123 pg/mL in septic shock to 11 pg/mL after exercise. In patients with severe SARS CoV-2 infections, blood levels of IL-6 were only 43 pg/mL, nearly three magnitudes lower than IL-6 levels in patients with septic shock. The clinical presentations of these different diseases do not correlate with blood levels of cytokines. Additionally, there is poor correlation between the concentrations of different cytokines among the different diseases. Specifically, blood levels of IL-6 did not correlate with levels of IL-8, IL-10, or TNF. Septic shock had the highest concentrations of cytokines, yet multiple cytokine inhibitors have failed to demonstrate improved outcomes in multiple clinical trials. Patients with autoimmune diseases have very low blood levels of cytokines (rheumatoid arthritis, IL-6 = 34 pg/mL; Crohn's disease, IL-6 = 5 pg/mL), yet respond dramatically to cytokine inhibitors. CONCLUSION The misleading term ""cytokine storm"" implies increased blood levels of cytokines are responsible for a grave clinical condition. Not all inflammatory conditions resulting in worsened disease states are correlated with significantly elevated cytokine levels, despite an association with the term ""cytokine storm"". ""Cytokine storm"" should be removed from the medical lexicon since it does not reflect the mediators driving the disease nor does it predict which diseases will respond to cytokine inhibitors.","Stolarski, Allan E; Kim, Jiyoun; Zhang, Qiuyang; Remick, Daniel G",Shock,231,1

Although APA disruption has been associated with FoG, there is scarce knowledge about its neural correlates. We sought to better understand the neural networks involved with APA in patients with FoG by assessing the level of hemodynamic response of specific brain regions and the functional connectivity during the leg lifting task. In the current investigation, APAs of patients with PD, with and without (nFoG) freezing were assessed during a leg lifting task in an event-related, functional magnetic resonance imaging (er-fMRI) protocol. Results identified a high hemodynamic response in the right anterior insula (AI) and supplementary motor area (SMA) in the FoG group when an APA was required. The nFoG had stronger connectivity between the right and left insulae than the FoG group. The strength of this connectivity was negatively correlated with the severity of FoG. Both groups showed different brain network organizations comprising the SMA and the bilateral AI. The SMA was found to be a hub in patients with FoG when an APA was required for the task. Our findings suggest that both groups used compensatory mechanism comprising the insulae during APA. Neither group used the entire network comprised of the insulae and SMA to accomplish the task. The FoG group relied more on SMA as a hub than as part of a broader network to exchange information during the APA.","de Lima-Pardini, Andrea C; Coelho, Daniel B; Nucci, Mariana P; Boffino, Catarina C; Batista, Alana X; de Azevedo Neto, Raymundo M; Silva-Batista, Carla; Barbosa, Egberto R; Cohen, Rajal G; Horak, Fay B; Teixeira, Luis A; Amaro, Edson",NeuroImage.

The objectives of the study were to examine the nature and dimensions of the plights of the IDPs in the Northeast, identify their coping strategies, and assess the impact of NEMA's response strategies on the burgeoning situation. The study used a qualitative survey research design, in which 166 key Informant Interviews (KII) were conducted. The primary designs were complemented by secondary data, which was derived from books, journal articles, and News tabloids. Data generated were descriptively analyzed. Major findings from the paper were that the Boko Haram insurgency was primarily responsible for the mass displacement of persons in North-eastern Nigeria. The IDPs are facing lots of challenges in the camps with weak coping strategies while the intervention of NEMA through the provision of relief materials, rehabilitation and resettlement programs, and linking of the displaced with family members have reduced the plights of the IDPs. However, the Agency currently has the minimal operational capacity to ameliorate the plights of the IDPs due to the protracted nature of the insurgency, legal restriction on the operational mandates of NEMA, corruption, and limited funding of the agency.

METHODS Twenty-two participants completed a combination of three balance task and three secondary cognitive (visuo-motor) task difficulty levels for a total of nine dual-task conditions. An additional eight participants were tested while performing the same three balance task difficulty levels on its own (i.e., single-tasking). The balance task required participants to maintain their balance on a fixed or rotating stabilometer while the visuo-motor task required participants to respond to moving targets presented on a monitor. Throughout each single- and dual-task trial, H-reflexes were elicited from the soleus. RESULTS Although dual-task performance, as quantified by visuo-motor task accuracy as well as the root mean square of the stabilometer position and velocity, decreased by 10-34% with increasing dual-task difficulty (p < 0.05), no changes in the soleus H-reflex amplitude were observed between dual-task conditions (p = 0.483-0.758). This contrasts to when participants performed the balance task as a single-task, where the H-reflex amplitude decreased by ~25% from the easy to the hard balance task difficulty level (p = 0.037). CONCLUSIONS In contrast to the commonly reported finding of a reduced soleus H-reflex amplitude when individuals perform a less posturally stable task by itself, the results indicate that spinal excitability is not modulated as a function of dual-task difficulty. It is possible that when an individual's attentional resource capacity is exceeded during dual-tasking, they become ineffective in regulating spinal excitability for balance control.","Day, Devon M; Boivin, Mario T; Adkin, Allan L; Tokuno, Craig D",European journal of applied physiology,231,20

However, the diagnostic performance of the test and its role in the diagnostic management of acute PE are still a matter of debate. OBJECTIVE The primary aim was to establish the diagnostic accuracy (sensitivity, specificity) of V/Q SPECT for PE diagnosis. The secondary aim was to review the clinical outcomes of patients investigated for PE suspicion with a standardized algorithm based on V/Q SPECT. METHODS We conducted a systematic review of diagnostic accuracy and management outcome studies involving patients evaluated with V/Q SPECT for suspected acute PE. We searched from inception to June 23, 2020, MEDLINE, Embase, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials for diagnostic accuracy studies, randomized controlled trials, and observational cohort studies. The methodological quality and risk of bias of eligible studies were assessed using the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies-2 (QUADAS-2) and the Risk of Bias in Nonrandomized Studies of Interventions tools. RESULTS We identified 13 accuracy studies and one prospective outcome study. Eleven diagnostic accuracy studies were deemed at high risk of bias in at least two of the four domains of QUADAS-2 evaluation and a further two studies raised concerns regarding the applicability of results, precluding the meta-analysis for accuracy indices. The only prospective cohort study demonstrated critical risk of bias. CONCLUSIONS Although V/Q SPECT has been widely implemented in daily clinical practice, the exact diagnostic performance of V/Q SPECT for PE is still unknown. This systematic review clearly identifies knowledge gaps and sets the agenda for future research.","Le Roux, Pierre-Yves; Robin, Philippe; Tromeur, Cécile; Davis, Alexandra; Robert-Ebadi, Helia; Carrier, Marc; Le Gal, Grégoire; Salaun, Pierre-Yves",Journal of thrombosis and haemostasis : JTH,231,16

OBJECTIVES To determine whether the presence of scapular dyskinesis in asymptomatic athletes increases the risk of developing shoulder pain by systematic review and meta-analysis. METHODS A systematic search was conducted in the Cochrane Library, Embase, PubMed, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, Allied and Complementary Medicine Database and SPORTDiscus. Prospective studies that assessed athletes for scapular dyskinesis and recorded incidents of shoulder pain were included. Study quality was assessed using the Downs and Black checklist. Meta-analysis was conducted to derive a pooled risk ratio (RR) for the development of shoulder pain in athletes with scapular dyskinesis compared with those without scapular dyskinesis. RESULTS Five studies were included with a total of 419 athletes. Of the athletes with scapular dyskinesis, 35% (56/160) experienced shoulder pain during the follow-up, whereas 25% (65/259) of athletes without scapular dyskinesis experienced symptoms. The presence of scapular dyskinesis at baseline indicated a 43% increased risk of a shoulder pain event over a 9 to 24 months follow-up (RR=1.43, 95% CI 1.05 to 1.93). CONCLUSIONS Athletes with scapular dyskinesis have 43% greater risk of developing shoulder pain than those without scapular dyskinesis.","Hickey, Darren; Solvig, Veronica; Cavalheri, Vinicius; Harrold, Meg; Mckenna, Leanda",British journal of sports medicine,231,24

METHODS This was an experimental prospective study of 16 healthy mixed breed male and female dogs. Animals were randomly divided into 2 groups. Two-layer side-to-side hand-sewn laparoscopic gastrojejunostomies were performed in group A, so that simple interrupted sutures were placed in the outer layer and simple continuous suture was used in the inner layer. The 1-layer simple continuous anastomosis between the stomach and jejunum was done in group B precisely. Specimen were collected from the sites of anastomosis, and H&E statining was performed for light microscopic studies. RESULTS All animals survived the surgery. There was no gross inflammation, ischemia, apparent granulation tissue, abscess or fistula formation, leakage or stricture formation, and all sites of anastomosis were patent. Several adhesion formations were found in the abdomen with the higher incidence in the control group. Mean scores of leukocyte infiltration and granulation tissue formation at the sites of anastomosis were statistically insignificant between groups (P>0.05). CONCLUSIONS Gross and histopathologic findings revealed that hand-sewn laparoscopic gastrointestinal anastomosis with the 1-layer suture technique is comparable to the 2-layer suture technique.","Tavakoli, Azine; Bakhtiari, Jalal; Khalaj, Ali Reza; Gharagozlou, Mohammad Javad; Veshkini, Abbas",JSLS : Journal of the Society of Laparoendoscopic Surgeons,231,19

METHODS Participants of Establishing Moderators and Biosignatures of Antidepressant Response in Clinical Care (EMBARC) study who completed Massachusetts General Hospital Anger Attack Questionnaire (AAQ) at baseline were included (n = 293). Levels of SI (suicidal thoughts factor of Concise Health Risk Tracking) were compared at baseline with generalized linear models, and during Stage 1 (baseline-to-week-8) and Stage 2 (week-8-to-week-16) with repeated-measures mixed model analyses. Covariates included age, sex, race, ethnicity, site, and treatment arm. RESULTS At baseline, participants with (n = 109) versus without anger attacks (n = 184) had higher levels of SI (Cohen's d effect size [d] = 1.20). Those with ≥9 anger attacks in the past month had significantly higher SI than those with 1-2 (d = 1.21), 3-4 (d = 1.48), and 5-8 (d = 0.94) anger attacks in the past month. Furthermore, participants with anger attacks at baseline reported higher SI at each post-baseline visit (both Stages 1 and 2) of EMBARC study (d = 0.39-0.77; all p < .05). Associations between anger attacks and SI were significant even after controlling for irritability, hostility, anxious arousal, depression, suicide propensity, and self-reported pain at baseline and lifetime suicidal tendencies. Similar results were found in participants with aggressive behaviors. CONCLUSION Anger attacks in outpatients with MDD may be associated with chronically elevated SI.

The aim of this study is to describe the management and results of the respective fracture types and different injury characteristics. MATERIALS AND METHODS This study performs a retrospective data analysis of 100 consecutive patients with a fracture of the proximal radius treated in a single high-volume pediatric trauma center. RESULTS One hundred patients [mean age 7.5 years (1-15)] were documented with a fracture of the proximal radius between 3/2011 and 12/2019. The gender distribution was 62 girls and 38 boys. Twenty-seven patients had concomitant injuries. Conservative treatment was performed in 63 patients (Judet I = 27; II = 30; III = 6; Mason I = 2) using an above-the-elbow cast for 21 days (6-35). Surgical treatment was performed in 37 patients (Judet II = 3; III = 22; IV = 5; V = 7) using elastic stable intramedullary nailing (ESIN). Open reduction was necessary in five cases, and additional immobilization was performed in 32 cases. Six complications occurred: loss of implant stability (n = 2), healing in malalignment, pseudarthrosis, radioulnar synostosis, and a persisting hypoesthesia at the thumb. As a result, two ESIN osteosynthesis were revised, and one radial head resection was performed. Loss of movement was seen in 11% of cases, overall Mayo elbow performance index (MEPI) was 99.8 (90-100), and none of the patients experienced negative impacts on activities of daily life. CONCLUSIONS Proximal radial fractures occur predominately without dislocation. Good results are obtained with conservative treatment throughout. In cases with displacement exceeding growth-related correction, ESIN is the undisputed treatment of choice. Open surgery and long immobilization periods should be avoided whenever possible.","Dietzel, Markus; Scherer, Simon; Esser, Michael; Kirschner, Hans-Joachim; Fuchs, Jörg; Lieber, Justus",Archives of orthopaedic and trauma surgery,231,12

In contrast to a large number of short and intermediate-term results, no series of SG with a follow-up of 5 years or more has been published so far. METHODS We report on the weight loss results of our first consecutive 26 patients with a complete follow-up of 5 years. Furthermore in a subgroup of 12 patients, plasma ghrelin levels were measured preoperatively, and up to 5 years following SG. RESULTS Weight loss defined as mean percent excess weight loss (%EWL) was found as 57.5 +/- 4.5, 60.3 +/- 5.0, 60.0 +/- 5.7, 58.4 +/- 5.4, and 55.0 +/- 6.8 (not converted, n = 21) for the first 5 years. Weight regain of more than 10 kg from nadir was observed in five (19.2%) of the 26 patients. Four of the patients (15.4%) were converted to gastric bypass due to severe reflux (n = 1, 3.8%) and weight loss failure (n = 3, 11.5%). A total of eight patients (30.8%) were at chronic need for proton pump inhibitor medication due to severe reflux. Plasma ghrelin levels were reduced from 593 +/- 52 to 219 +/- 23 pg/ml 12 months postoperatively, with a slightly, non-significant increase toward the 5-years values of mean 257 +/- 23 pg/ml. CONCLUSIONS At 5-year follow-up, a mean EWL of 55.0 +/- 6.8% was achieved, indicating that SG leads to stable weight loss. Beside significant weight regain, severe reflux might necessitate conversion to gastric bypass or duodenal switch. After an immediate reduction postoperatively, plasma ghrelin levels remained low for the first 5 years postoperatively.","Bohdjalian, Arthur; Langer, Felix B; Shakeri-Leidenmühler, Soheila; Gfrerer, Lisa; Ludvik, Bernhard; Zacherl, Johannes; Prager, Gerhard",Obesity surgery,231,16

A few nm-thin WSe2 and MoTe2 flakes are vertically stacked on gate dielectric, and bottom p-MoTe2 plays as channel for hole transport. Interestingly, the WSe2/MoTe2 stack interface functions as hole trapping sites where traps behave nonvolatile although trapping/de-trapping can be controlled by gate voltage (VGS). Memory retention after high VGS pulse appears longer than 10,000 s and Program/Erase ratio in drain current is higher than 200.

Clinical data were collected prospectively to compare safety and feasibility between two techniques. RESULTS Ninety-two patients underwent trans-anal local excision for lower rectal tumors. TEO and TAE were performed in 48 and 44 patients, respectively. Age, sex, and comorbidities were similar. There was no significant difference in tumor diameter (1.6 ± 1.68 cm vs. 1.17 ± 1.17, respectively). Tumor height, however, was higher in the TEO (7.46 ± 3 cm) than the TAE group (3.84 ± 1.88 cm, p < 0.001). Four complications, perianal abscess, and two perforations, occurred in the TEO group, whereas no major complications occurred in the TAE. Seven patients (14.6%) underwent TEO underwent a salvage operation compared to only a single patient in TAE group (2.3%, p = 0.039). Eight patients (17.4%) diagnosed with adenocarcinoma developed recurrence, four in each group. Disease-free survival was similar between groups (TEO - 41.8 months, 95% RI 39.4-44.1; TAE 79.7 months, 95% RI 72.2-87.3). However, more TAE patients (n = 7, 15.9%) than TEO patients (n = 2, 4.2%) underwent chemotherapy. CONCLUSIONS TEO treatment of local rectal tumors is safe and feasible and can achieve an adequate resection margin. Local recurrence was similar in both groups. However, the numbers of salvage operations and minor complications were higher in the TEO group.","Al Bandar, Mahdi Hussain; Han, Yoon Dae; Razvi, Syed Asim; Cho, Min Soo; Hur, Hyuk; Min, Byung Soh; Lee, Kang Young; Kim, Nam Kyu",Annals of medicine and surgery,231,1
111330,111330,111330,Nephrogenic systemic fibrosis: A survey of the use of gadolinium-based contrast agents in Ghana.,14.486419,6.8264003,2017,"UNLABELLED Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) nucleocapsid (N) protein is the main component of the viral capsid to encapsulate viral RNA, and it is also a multifunctional protein involved in the regulation of host cell processes. Nonstructural protein 9 (Nsp9) is the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase that plays a critical role in viral RNA transcription and replication. In this study, we demonstrate that PRRSV N protein is bound to Nsp9 by protein-protein interaction and that the contacting surface on Nsp9 is located in the two predicted α-helixes formed by 48 residues at the C-terminal end of the protein. Mutagenesis analyses identified E646, E608, and E611 on Nsp9 and Q85 on the N protein as the pivotal residues participating in the N-Nsp9 interaction. By overexpressing the N protein binding fragment of Nsp9 in infected Marc-145 cells, the synthesis of viral RNAs, as well as the production of infectious progeny viruses, was dramatically inhibited, suggesting that Nsp9-N protein association is involved in the process of viral RNA production. In addition, we show that PRRSV N interacts with cellular RNA helicase DHX9 and redistributes the protein into the cytoplasm. Knockdown of DHX9 increased the ratio of short subgenomic mRNAs (sgmRNAs); in contrast, DHX9 overexpression benefited the synthesis of longer sgmRNAs and the viral genomic RNA (gRNA). These results imply that DHX9 is recruited by the N protein in PRRSV infection to regulate viral RNA synthesis. We postulate that N and DHX9 may act as antiattenuation factors for the continuous elongation of nascent transcript during negative-strand RNA synthesis. IMPORTANCE It is unclear whether the N protein of PRRSV is involved in regulation of the viral RNA production process. In this report, we demonstrate that the N protein of the arterivirus PRRSV participates in viral RNA replication and transcription through interacting with Nsp9 and its RdRp and recruiting cellular RNA helicase to promote the production of longer viral sgmRNAs and gRNA. Our data here provide some new insights into the discontinuous to continuous extension of PRRSV RNA synthesis and also offer a new potential anti-PRRSV strategy targeting the N-Nsp9 and/or N-DHX9 interaction.","Liu, Long; Tian, Jiao; Nan, Hao; Tian, Mengmeng; Li, Yuan; Xu, Xiaodong; Huang, Baicheng; Zhou, Enmin; Hiscox, Julian A; Chen, Hongying",Journal of virology,231,17

Treatment aims to restore the integrity of the extensor mechanism and the congruity of patellofemoral joint. Controversy exists regarding the ideal fixation method. Metallic constructs aiming to convert pulling forces on the anterior aspect of the patella into compression forces across the fracture site are the standard of care. More recently, low profile plates have been described in the management of comminuted patellar fractures. The aims of this study were to (1) develop a novel unstable patellar fracture model and (2) to compare biomechanically three different constructs for fixation comminuted patellar fractures. We hypothesized that an orthogonal biplanar disposition of the screws within an anteriorly placed locking plate provides the best biomechanical properties in the management of comminuted fractures. Methods Six-part complex AO 34-C3 patella fractures were simulated in 18 human cadaveric knees by means of osteotomies including comminution around the distal patellar pole. The specimens were randomly assigned to 3 fixation techniques (n ​= ​6) for either anterior plating, antero-lateral plating, or tension band wiring (TBW). Biomechanical testing was performed over 5000 cycles in active extension and passive flexion, followed by ultimate destructive quasi-static testing. Interfragmentary movements were captured by means of optical motion tracking. Results Displacement between the proximal and distal medial patella fragments was lower after anterior plating compared to both antero-lateral plating (P ​= ​0.084) and TBW (P ​< ​0.001). Moreover, displacement between the proximal and distal lateral fragments was significantly lower after anterior plating compared to both other techniques (P ​≤ ​0.032). In addition, it was significantly lower for antero-lateral plating versus TBW (P ​< ​0.001). Rotation around the medio-lateral axis between the proximal and distal medial fragments was significantly lower after anterior plating compared to TBW (P ​= ​0.017). Conclusions Anterior mesh plating with biplanar placement of locking screws provides superior stability for fixation of comminuted patellar fractures when compared to both antero-lateral mesh plating and TBW. The latter is associated with considerably inferior performance.","Kfuri, Mauricio; Escalante, Igor; Schopper, Clemens; Zderic, Ivan; Stoffel, Karl; Sommer, Christoph; Qawasmi, Feras; Knobe, Matthias; Richards, Geoff; Gueorguiev, Boyko",Journal of orthopaedic translation,231,4

IFITM3 is a member of a large protein superfamily, whose members share a functionally undefined area of high amino acid conservation, the CD225 domain. We performed mutational analyses of IFITM3 and identified multiple residues within the CD225 domain, consisting of the first intramembrane domain (intramembrane domain 1 [IM1]) and a conserved intracellular loop (CIL), that are required for restriction of both influenza A virus (IAV) and dengue virus (DENV) infection in vitro. Two phenylalanines within IM1 (F75 and F78) also mediate a physical association between IFITM proteins, and the loss of this interaction decreases IFITM3-mediated restriction. By extension, similar IM1-mediated associations may contribute to the functions of additional members of the CD225 domain family. IFITM3's distal N-terminal domain is also needed for full antiviral activity, including a tyrosine (Y20), whose alteration results in mislocalization of a portion of IFITM3 to the cell periphery and surface. Comparative analyses demonstrate that similar molecular determinants are needed for IFITM3's restriction of both IAV and DENV. However, a portion of the CIL including Y99 and R87 is preferentially needed for inhibition of the orthomyxovirus. Several IFITM3 proteins engineered with rare single-nucleotide polymorphisms demonstrated reduced expression or mislocalization, and these events were associated with enhanced viral replication in vitro, suggesting that possessing such alleles may impact an individual's risk for viral infection. On the basis of this and other data, we propose a model for IFITM3-mediated restriction.","John, Sinu P; Chin, Christopher R; Perreira, Jill M; Feeley, Eric M; Aker, Aaron M; Savidis, George; Smith, Sarah E; Elia, Andrew E H; Everitt, Aaron R; Vora, Mehul; Pertel, Thomas; Elledge, Stephen J; Kellam, Paul; Brass, Abraham L",Journal of virology,231,29

Although open anatrophic nephrolithotomy can result in higher stone-free rates, it is rarely performed because of increased morbidity. To provide a minimally invasive alternative, we developed the technique of robot-assisted anatrophic nephrolithotomy (RANL) incorporating ice slush for renal hypothermia. Three patients with staghorn calculi (mean total stone volume 12887.67 mm(3)) underwent RANL with iced cold ischemia. A GelPOINT™ port was used for ice slush insertion. Intracorporeal temperatures were <9°C within 30 minutes of cold ischemia. Mean console and cold ischemia times were 167 and 56.7 minutes, respectively. Mean blood loss was 100 mL. There were no complications. Two patients had residual fragments measuring 13 mm, and two 9 mm stones, respectively. RANL with iced cold ischemia is a safe and feasible option that may be considered in patients with staghorn stones. Further study is needed to refine the technique and assess long-term functional outcomes.","Ghani, Khurshid R; Rogers, Craig G; Sood, Akshay; Kumar, Ramesh; Ehlert, Michael; Jeong, Wooju; Ganpule, Arvind; Bhandari, Mahendra; Desai, Mahesh; Menon, Mani",Journal of endourology,231,1

COVID19 is an interesting case study because there have been very different outcomes in different localities. These variations are best studied after the fact if precision is the goal; while a pandemic is still unfolding less precise analysis is of value in attempting to guide localities in the early stages to learn lessons of those that preceded them. Methods: I examine three factors that could differentiate strategy: asymptomatic spread, differences in use of the Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) tuberculosis vaccine and cloth face masks. Results: These differences point to the possibility of alternative strategies to prevent COVID-19 from entering the runaway phase. The most promising is testing all contacts of anyone who has tested positive, not only those who are symptomatic. In principle such a study should be able to demonstrate not only what fraction are asymptomatic but also measure asymptomatic transmission by another round of contact tracing. Should this demonstrate asymptomatic transmission, then all contacts of anyone who tests positive should be isolated and tested, and only released from quarantine when it is clear that they are past incubation and not positive. Conclusions: Before a COVID-19 outbreak reaches the runaway phase where exponential growth makes accurate trace-and test impossible, a strategy that takes into account asymptomatic transmission is viable and should be attempted to avoid the necessity for a prolonged lock down.","Machanick, Philip",F1000Research,231,1

The nanoparticles thus obtained presented 93% (TiO2-MW) and 92% (TiO2-US) anatase phase, and TiO2-PP 93% rutile phase. The TiO2-US sample performed best during the Prozac® photodegradation assays because of its lipophilic surface, attributable to the C-H groups therein. Additionally, adsorption rate and photodegradation were optimized by adjusting Prozac® solution to pH ~ 8. Following Prozac® photodegradation, quantitative monitoring of its by-products (PPMA, MAEB, and TFMP) was done using HPLC. This quantitative approach led us to conclude that semiconductor photoactivity cannot be discussed solely in terms of the main compound. Lastly, it was seen that these by-products compete with each other in the degradation mechanisms and are influenced by different materials.

METHODS We retrospectively studied thirty-five consecutive patients (71% female, mean ± standard deviation (SD) age: 66 ± 11 years) referred clinically for positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) myocardial perfusion imaging at a median (interquartile range, IQR) interval of 4.3 (2.1, 9.7) years following RT for a variety of malignancies. Radiation dose-volume histograms were generated for the heart and coronary arteries for each patient. RESULTS The median (IQR) of mean cardiac radiation doses was 12.0 (1.2, 24.2) Gray. There were significant inverse correlations between mean radiation dose and global MFR (MFRGlobal) and MFR in the left anterior descending artery territory (MFRLAD): Pearson's correlation coefficient = - .37 (P = .03) and - .38 (P = .03), respectively. For every one Gray increase in mean cardiac radiation dose, there was a mean ± standard error decrease of .02 ± .01 in MFRGlobal (P = .04) and MFRLAD (P = .03) after adjustment.

In recent years, natural products (NPs) have been studied broadly for their multi-targeted activities under pathological conditions. Interestingly, several attempts have been made to outline the immunomodulatory properties of NPs. Research on in-vitro and in-vivo models have shown the immunomodulatory activity of NPs, is due to their antiinflammatory property, induction of phagocytosis and immune cells stimulation activity. Moreover, studies on humans have suggested that phytomedicines reduce inflammation and could provide appropriate benefits either in single form or complex combinations with other agents preventing disease progression, subsequently enhancing the efficacy of treatment to combat multiple malignancies. However, the exact mechanism of immunomodulation is far from clear, warranting more detailed investigations on their effectiveness. Nevertheless, the reduction of inflammatory cascades is considered as a prime protective mechanism in a number of inflammation regulated autoimmune diseases. Altogether, this review will discuss the biological activities of plant-derived secondary metabolites, such as polyphenols, alkaloids, saponins, polysaccharides and so forth, against various diseases and their potential use as an immunomodulatory agent under pathological conditions.","Ali, Syed Afroz; Singh, Gurpreet; Datusalia, Ashok Kumar",Phytotherapy research : PTR,231,1

Those with previous thyroid dysfunctions or taking interfering drugs were excluded. Differently from previous reports, TSH, FT3, FT4, thyroglobulin (Tg), anti-Tg autoantibodies (TgAb) were measured at baseline and every 3-7 days. C-reacting protein (CRP), cortisol and IL-6 were also assayed. Results The majority of patients had a normal TSH at admission, usually with normal FT4 and FT3. Low TSH levels were found either at admission or during hospitalization in 39% of patients, associated with low FT3 in half of the cases. FT4 and Tg levels were normal, and TgAb negative.

Visual analysis of PGES, known to be subjective, may account for this. In this study, we set out to perform an analysis of PGES presence and duration using a validated signal processing tool, specifically to examine the association between PGES and seizure features previously reported to be associated with visually analyzed PGES. Methods: This is a prospective, multicenter epilepsy monitoring study of autonomic and breathing biomarkers of SUDEP in adult patients with intractable epilepsy. We studied videoelectroencephalogram (vEEG) recordings of generalized convulsive seizures (GCS) in a cohort of patients in whom respiratory and vEEG recording were carried out during the evaluation in the epilepsy monitoring unit.

In addition, presence of decerebration (p = 0.004) and decortication (p = 0.02), older age (p = 0.009), and hypoxemia duration (p = 0.03) were associated with longer PGES durations. Conclusions: In this study, we confirmed observations made with visual analysis, that presence of tonic phase during GCS, longer hypoxemia, and older age are reliably associated with PGES. We found that of the different types of tonic phase posturing, decerebration has the strongest association with PGES, followed by decortication, followed by hemi-decerebration. This suggests that these factors are likely indicative of seizure severity and may or may not be associated with SUDEP. An automated signal processing tool enables objective metrics, and may resolve apparent ambiguities in the role of PGES in SUDEP and seizure severity studies.","Zhao, Xiuhe; Vilella, Laura; Zhu, Liang; Rani, M R Sandhya; Hampson, Johnson P; Hampson, Jaison; Hupp, Norma J; Sainju, Rup K; Friedman, Daniel; Nei, Maromi; Scott, Catherine; Allen, Luke; Gehlbach, Brian K; Schuele, Stephan; Harper, Ronald M; Diehl, Beate; Bateman, Lisa M; Devinsky, Orrin; Richerson, George B; Zhang, Guo-Qiang; Lhatoo, Samden D; Lacuey, Nuria",Frontiers in neurology,231,1

Alternatively, deep sedation and analgesia may be required. OBJECTIVES The aim of our study was to compare the Bispectral Index (BIS) and Comfort Score (CS) with respect to their clinical significance for sedation/analgesia in children undergoing open muscle biopsy. METHODS Thirty pediatric patients subjected to open muscle biopsy for diagnosis of their underlying disease were prospectively enrolled. Sedation/analgesia was performed in all patients using remifentanil and propofol. The patients were simultaneously monitored using the CS and BIS. RESULTS All sedations and muscle biopsies were performed uneventfully. The CS and BIS were significantly correlated (R = 0.589; P < 0.01). Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis revealed an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.918 with a maximum cut-off point of BIS 70.5 (sensitivity 0.9; specificity 0.785) for adequate sedation. Sensitivity of 100% was achieved at BIS 60. Accordingly, all patients with BIS ≤60 had CS within the target range of 10-14. The BIS showed substantial intra- and interindividual variability (30 points and 58 points, respectively) during sedation, whereas CS varied only within close ranges during sedation. In 25 patients, sedatives were reduced according to low BIS values (<60). No unintended anesthesia awareness was noted during the study period. CONCLUSION Bispectral Index provides an additional helpful tool to guide sedation/analgesia in minor surgical procedures in children. BIS values ≤60 correlated with sufficient depth of sedation and prevented unintended awareness. Additionally, BIS measurement allowed for distinct regulation of depth of sedation without prolonged sedation/analgesia due to unintended overdose.","Tschiedel, Eva; Müller, Oliver; Schara, Ulrike; Felderhoff-Müser, Ursula; Dohna-Schwake, Christian",Paediatric anaesthesia,231,1

In this study, we sought to determine the role of specific microRNA (miRs) associated with VEGF in patients with PDR pathology. METHODS RNA sequencing was employed to detect differentially circulating microRNA (miR) associated with VEGF in DM (Diabetes mellitus), NPDR (non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy) and PDR patients. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was performed to measure the concentration of miR-15b in the serum of DM patients (n=115), NPDR (n=47) or PDR (n=76). The effects of miR-15b on DR and regulation of VEGF and endothelial cell function were also characterized. RESULTS We demonstrated that circulating miR-15b was directly associated with VEGF compared to other miRs in PDR patients. We found a significant inverse relationship between low levels of miR-15b and high levels of VEGF in patients with PDR when compared to the DM or NPDR groups. We found that miR-15b regulates the expression of VEGF by targeting the 3'-UTR regions to inhibit its transcription. Similarly, overexpression of miR-15b suppressed vascular abnormalities in vivo in diabetic GK rats, inhibiting endothelial tube formation, and VEGF expression. CONCLUSION In conclusion, circulating miR-15b is associated with PDR and may be targeted to regulate VEGF expression and angiogenesis.","Yang, Ying; Liu, Yan; Li, Yiping; Chen, Zhongli; Xiong, Yixin; Zhou, Taicheng; Tao, Wenyu; Xu, Fan; Yang, Hanling; Ylä-Herttuala, Seppo; Chaurasia, Shyam S; Whaley-Connell, Adam; Yang, Ke",The Journal of clinical endocrinology and metabolism,231,22

Unintended inflammation, foreign body reactions and ischemia-triggered neoangiogenesis are clinical drawbacks of permanent embolic materials. The aim of the current study was to characterize a new type of biodegradable starch microsphere with regard to angiographic and histopathological features such as patterns of acute arterial occlusion as well as induction of tissue necrosis, microsphere biodegradation, and inflammation and foreign body reactions during follow-up. Key characteristics of both biodegradable prototypes (L1 and L2; prototype groups) were as follows: microspheres are biodegradable by serum α-amylase, produced from chemically crosslinked potato starch to different extents, in a diameter range of ∼300-800 µm, differing in size distribution and featuring a microsphere deformation of ∼1%. In vivo transarterial embolization with L1 and L2, while applying clinical standard techniques, was performed and compared with clinically established permanent microspheres (Embosphere®500-700 and Embosphere®700-900; control groups). Twenty-four pig kidneys were embolized with the different embolic materials by following the study protocol, and there were no technical failures or complications. Parenchymal necrosis with interstitial calcification was observed in all kidneys independent of the type of embolic material used. Compared with the permanent embolic materials, biodegradable microspheres showed complete (L1) or partial (L2) biodegradation within one week after transarterial embolization, and induced a comparable (L1) or a lower (L2) degree of arterial wall necrosis and a lower degree of inflammation and foreign body reactions. In conclusion, the presented new type of biodegradable microsphere is promising, and could be further evaluated in terms of clinical translation.","Sommer, Christof M; Do, Thuy D; Schlett, Christopher L; Flechsig, Paul; Gockner, Theresa L; Kuthning, Anja; Vollherbst, Dominik F; Pereira, Philippe L; Kauczor, Hans U; Macher-Göppinger, Stephan",Journal of biomaterials applications,231,1

These poly plant extracts were investigated and optimized for the stability, safety and moisturizing ability. The combination moisturizing effect was determined by measuring the expression of FLG mRNA, CLDN-1 mRNA and AQP3 protein. Toxicological analysis included a red blood cell hemolysis test and a 3T3 phototoxicity test. It has been observed that by using polysaccharide yield as the evaluation criterion showed optimal extraction at a material-to-liquid ratio of 1:100, an extraction temperature of 100 °C, and an extraction time of 3 h. Moisturizing effect experiments showed that the expression of FLG mRNA, CLDN-1 mRNA and AQP3 protein was significantly increased. Toxicological tests showed that the composition was safe and caused no irritating effects. Based on these results, this poly TCM moisturizing formulation is safe within moisturizing effects and can be used as a moisturizing raw material in cosmetics. This article is protected by copyright.

It activates coagulation and fuels the risk of thrombosis. Human pregnancy is associated with a mild proinflammatory state characterized by circulatory neutrophil activation which is further increased in complicated pregnancies, placenta-mediated complications being associated with an increased thrombotic risk. This aberrant activation leads to an increased release of nucleosomes in the blood flow. The aim of our study was to initially quantify nucleosome-bound histones in normal pregnancy and in placenta-mediated complication counterpart. We analyzed the role of histones on extravillous trophoblast function. Circulating nucleosome-bound histones H3 (Nu.QH3.1, Nu.QH3PanCit, Nu.QH3K27me3) and H4 (Nu.QH4K16Ac) were increased in complicated pregnancies. In vitro using the extravillous cell line HTR-8/SVNeo, we observed that free recombinant H2B, H3, and H4 inhibited migration in wound healing assay, but only H3 also blocked invasion in Matrigel-coated Transwell experiments. H3 and H4 also induced apoptosis, whereas H2B did not. Finally, the negative effects of H3 on invasion and apoptosis could be restored with enoxaparin, a low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH), but not with aspirin. Different circulating nucleosome-bound histones are increased in complicated pregnancy and this would affect migration, invasion, and induce apoptosis of extravillous trophoblasts. Histones might be part of the link between the risk of thrombosis and pregnancy complications, with an effect of LMWH on both.","Bouvier, Sylvie; Fortier, Mathieu; Vincent, Laura; Demattei, Christophe; Mousty, Eve; Herzog, Marielle; Rommelaere, Guillaume; Nouvellon, Eva; Mercier, Eric; Letouzey, Vincent; Gris, Jean-Christophe",Thrombosis and haemostasis,231,26

Additional disability adds to the already high costs of the procedure. To weigh the cost and benefit, we estimated the cost-utility of carotid angioplasty and stenting compared with carotid endarterectomy among patients with symptomatic carotid stenosis, with special emphasis on scenario analyses that would yield carotid angioplasty and stenting as the cost-effective alternative relative to carotid endarterectomy. MATERIALS AND METHODS A cost-utility analysis from the perspective of the health system payer was performed by using a Markov analytic model. Clinical estimates were based on a meta-analysis. The procedural costs were derived from a microcosting data base. The costs for hospitalization and rehabilitation of patients with stroke were based on a Canadian multicenter study. Utilities were based on a randomized controlled trial. RESULTS In the base case analysis, carotid angioplasty and stenting were more expensive (incremental cost of $6107) and had a lower utility (-0.12 quality-adjusted life years) than carotid endarterectomy. The results are sensitive to changes in the risk of clinical events and the relative risk of death and stroke. Carotid angioplasty and stenting were more economically attractive among high-risk surgical patients. For carotid angioplasty and stenting to become the preferred option, their costs would need to fall from more than $7300 to $4350 or less and the risks of the periprocedural and annual minor strokes would have to be equivalent to that of carotid endarterectomy. CONCLUSIONS In the base case analysis, carotid angioplasty and stenting were associated with higher costs and lower utility compared with carotid endarterectomy for patients with symptomatic carotid stenosis. Carotid angioplasty and stenting were cost-effective for patients with high surgical risk.","Almekhlafi, M A; Hill, M D; Wiebe, S; Goyal, M; Yavin, D; Wong, J H; Clement, F M",AJNR.

This purpose can be achieved by applying alcohol-based hand rubs, washing hands properly with soap and water, and applying other antiseptic agents. Nevertheless, regular hand hygiene could also be challenging, because water, detergents, and disinfectants may predispose HCWs to hand dermatitis. The current article reviews the risk factors for the development of hand dermatitis, with further focus on the most common agents used among HCWs. In addition, the risk of occupational hand dermatitis for each agent is evaluated to increase awareness of this common condition.

Cytoreductive surgery followed by intraperitoneal (IP) chemotherapy using oxaliplatin has attracted attention; however, the short half-life of oxaliplatin and its rapid clearance from the peritoneal cavity limit its clinical application. Here, a multivesicular liposomal (MVL) depot of oxaliplatin was prepared for IP administration, with an expected prolonged effect. After optimization, a combination of phospholipids, cholesterol, and triolein was used based on its ability to produce MVL depots of monomodal size distribution (1-20 µm; span 1.99) with high entrapment efficiency (EE) (92.16% ± 2.17%). An initial burst release followed by a long lag phase of drug release was observed for the MVL depots system in vitro. An in vivo pharmacokinetic study mimicking the early postoperative IP chemotherapy regimen in rats showed significantly improved bioavailability, and the mean residence time of oxaliplatin after IP administration revealed that slow and continuous erosion of the MVL particles yielded a sustained drug release. Thus, oxaliplatin-loaded MVL depots presented in this study have potential for use in the treatment of colorectal cancer.","Abuzar, Sharif Md; Park, Eun Jung; Seo, Yeji; Lee, Juseung; Baik, Seung Hyuk; Hwang, Sung-Joo",Pharmaceutics,231,1

A significant number of the non-survivors showed cardiac-renal-vasculature dysfunction. A 'cytokine storm' namely, interleukin IL6-IL1 receptors i.e. IL6R-IL1R over-functioning was reported. Here, nigellidine, an indazole-alkaloid and key-component of Nigella Sativa L. (NS) commonly known as black-cumin-seed was analyzed for COVID-19 protein-targeting and IL1R-IL6R inhibition through molecular-docking-study and biochemical-study in experimental-rat to evaluate antioxidative-capacity. The NMR/X-ray-crystallographic/Electron-microscopic structures of COVID-19 Main-protease (6LU7)/Spike-glycoprotein(6vsb)/NSP2(QHD43415_2)/Nucleocapsid(QHD43423), Human IL1R(1itb)-IL6R(1pm9) from PDB were retrieved-analyzed for receptor-ligand interaction. Then those structures were docked with nigellidine using Autodock and Patchdock-server. A brief comparison was made with nigellicine-thymoquinone from N. sativa. Where nigellidine showed highest binding-energy of -6.6 (kcal/mol), ligand-efficiency of -0.3 with COVID19 Nsp2 forming bonds with amino acid CYS240 present in binding-pocket. Nigellidine showed strong interaction with main-protease (BE:-6.38/LE:-0.29). Nigellidine showed affinity to IL1R (-6.23). The NS treated rat showed marked decline in ALP-SGPT-SGOT-malondialdehyde(MDA) than the basal-levels. From the Western-blot and activity-analysis it was observed that Nigellidine (sulfuryl-group-drug) showed no impact on Phenol-catalyzing ASTIV and Steroid-catalyzing estrogen-sulfotransferase expressions and activities in liver-tissue and thus has no influence in sulfation-mediated adverse metabolic-processes. Conclusively, nigellidine has hepato-reno-protective/antioxidant-immunomodulatory/anti-inflammatory activities with inhibit-potentials of COVID-19 proteins.

A total of 72 boars were used in a randomized design with three treatments: single immunization (SI) (10 weeks of age) or double immunization (DI) (10 and 15 weeks of age) with Improvest® and intact controls (no Improvest®; CNT) (n=24/group). At 10, 15, 20, 25 and 40 weeks of age, blood was collected and serum harvested to evaluate testosterone concentrations. Testosterone concentrations were less for DI boars compared with CNT boars and SI boars at 20 and 25 weeks (P<0.001), but not at 40 weeks of age. At week 25, 18 pigs (n=6/group) were sacrificed and testes were removed, weighed and measured, and seminiferous tubules were examined and scored using histological slides of testes parenchyma. A sample of neck fat was assessed for boar taint aroma. All testicular measurements and weights and seminiferous tubule scores were less for DI boars compared with SI and CNT boars (P<0.001). More (P<0.05) SI and CNT boars had detectable boar taint aroma than DI boars. Libido was assessed at 32, 36, 47, 60 and 63 weeks of age and semen collected at 60 weeks of age was analyzed for indicators of quality. There were no effects of treatment (P=0.41) or treatment by week (P=0.71) on libido. Semen volume, gel weight and total number of sperm cells, determined in a subset of boars (n=3/treatment), were not different among treatments.

OBJECTIVE To describe a methodology to determine the impact of the restrictions on healthcare utilization. DESIGN, SETTING, POPULATION: Population-based study of the Greater Toronto area and unaffected comparator regions, before, during and after the SARS outbreak (April 2001 to March 2004). OUTCOME MEASURES Population-based rates of hospital admissions, emergency department and outpatient visits, inter-hospital transfers, diagnostic testing and essential drug prescribing, adjusted for age and sex. METHODS We will assess the temporal patterns of healthcare utilization rates before, during and after the SARS restrictions in different regions using administrative health databases and longitudinal data analysis methods (generalized estimating equations). We will also use longitudinal cohort models to assess the effects of the restrictions to outcomes in cohorts diagnosed with specific chronic diseases. CONCLUSION We will document the extent to which utilization of healthcare services decreased during the SARS epidemic and identify clinical problem areas where SARS-related restrictions had adverse consequences on health. This work will have planning implications for future outbreaks of SARS or other infectious diseases. Understanding how the outbreak control measures affected use of health services and ultimately the health of the population, is an important part of understanding the impact of SARS restrictions.","Schull, Michael J; Stukel, Therese A; Vermeulen, Marian J; Alter, David",Expert review of pharmacoeconomics & outcomes research,231,29

In resistant C57BL/6 mice, CVB3 myocarditis is abrogated by T-cell-dependent mechanisms, whereas major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-matched permissive A.BY/SnJ mice develop chronic myocarditis based on virus persistence. To define the role of T-cell-priming dendritic cells (DCs) in the outcome of CVB3 myocarditis, DCs were analyzed in this animal model in the course of CVB3 infection. In both mouse strains, DCs were found to be infectible with CVB3; however, formation of infectious virions was impaired. In DCs derived from C57BL/6 mice, significantly higher quantities of interleukin-10 (IL-10) and the proinflammatory cytokines IL-6 and tumor necrosis factor alpha were measured compared to those from A.BY/SnJ mice. Additionally, the chemokines interferon-inducible protein 10 (IP-10) and RANTES were secreted by DCs from resistant C57BL/6 mice earlier in infection and at significantly higher levels. The protective role of IP-10 in CVB3 myocarditis was confirmed in IP-10(-/-) mice, which had increased myocardial injury compared to the immunocompetent control animals. Also, major differences in resistant and permissive mice were found in DC subsets, with C57BL/6 mice harboring more cross-priming CD4(-) CD8(+) DCs. As CD4(-) CD8(+) DCs are known to express 10 times more Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) than other DC subsets, we followed the course of CVB3 infection in TLR3(-/-) mice. These mice developed a fulminant acute myocarditis and secreted sustained low amounts of type I interferons; secretion of IP-10 and RANTES was nearly abrogated in DCs. We conclude that MHC-independent genetic factors involving DC-related IP-10 secretion and TLR3 expression are beneficial in the prevention of chronic coxsackievirus myocarditis.","Weinzierl, Andreas Oliver; Szalay, Gudrun; Wolburg, Hartwig; Sauter, Martina; Rammensee, Hans-Georg; Kandolf, Reinhard; Stevanović, Stefan; Klingel, Karin",Journal of virology,231,1

Survivors may have considerable ongoing limitations, requiring a caregiver for a prolonged period. OBJECTIVES To learn about experiences, quality of life, coping, resilience, and social support of caregiver caring for survivors of sepsis. METHODS We conducted a convergent mixed-methods study, recruiting informal caregivers of patients who had survived sepsis in the past year and were readmitted to the intensive care unit with sepsis. Individual face-to-face, semistructured interviews and validated surveys on quality of life, coping, caregiver burden, resilience, and social support were administered to caregivers. Interview transcripts were analyzed using content analysis. Surveys were scored and summarized using descriptive statistics. RESULTS Caregivers were primarily middle-aged, White, and female. Half were spouses of their care recipient. Caregivers reported some deficits in mobility, pain, and anxiety/depression. Coping styles varied, with engaged coping being more prevalent. Most caregivers reported mild to moderate burden, all reported either normal or high resilience levels, and types of social support were similar. However, interviews and survey findings were not always consistent. Major themes that emerged from the analysis included (1) advocating for and protecting their loved one, (2) coping with caregiving, (3) uncertain future, (4) rewards of caregiving, and (5) need to optimize communication with family. DISCUSSION Caregivers of sepsis survivors are protective of their care recipient and use a variety of strategies to advocate for their loved one and to cope with the uncertainty involved in a new intensive care unit admission. More advocacy and support are needed for this population.","Umberger, Reba A; Todt, Kendrea; Talbott, Elizabeth; Sparks, Laurie; Thomas, Sandra P",Dimensions of critical care nursing : DCCN,231,1

How to interpret FVC findings in an individual patient with IPF in the real-world setting amid uncertainty about the measurement accuracy and variability has not been well established. AREAS COVERED This review highlights the challenges and limitations of using FVC in the clinic to monitor disease progression in patients with IPF. Spirometry is noninvasive, relatively simple, and inexpensive. FVC measurements provide evidence for trends over time in patients with IPF. When using FVC in the clinic, several important challenges and limitations, including visit-to-visit variability, dependence on patient effort, inconsistent quality control, limitations on accuracy, and the influence of comorbidities and pretest factors, must be considered. Recent studies suggest the potential for home spirometry devices to facilitate more frequent collection of data and perhaps demonstrate more accurate trends. EXPERT OPINION Measuring FVC decline in the clinic has an important role in monitoring disease progression in patients with IPF, but additional measures of disease progression should be considered along with FVC to facilitate decision-making about disease management.","Nathan, Steven D; Wanger, Jack; Zibrak, Joseph D; Wencel, Mark L; Burg, Cindy; Stauffer, John L",Expert review of respiratory medicine,231,1

However, their drug release processes were usually discussed in the absence of proteins, which are abundant in real delivery media and likely to affect the release behaviors. In this work, novel pH-sensitive silica-based DDSs were constructed using the endogenous protein, human serum albumin (HSA), as the gatekeeper, and their release properties in protein-containing media were measured for the first time. As-synthesized mesoporous silica nanorod (MSNR) was modified with zwitterions to suppress the nonspecific adsorption of protein and to improve the dispersity. HSA was fixed onto MSNR through drug-protein interactions and covalent bonds, respectively. Benzoic-imine bonds were introduced into the designs to realize pH responsiveness. The fluorescence quenching effect of drugs on HSA was used to monitor the drug release in simulated body fluids containing proteins. The results indicated that protein gating could effectively reduce premature release in normal blood environment. The endogenous protein capping, high dispersity and stability, considerable loading content, low cytotoxicity and favorable responsiveness to acidic microenvironment enable the present structures to be promising carriers for chemotherapy drugs.","Zhang, Huaxin; Xia, Qinghua; Zhou, Dan","Colloids and surfaces.

METHODS From November 2017 to November 2020, a total of 2340 patients were enrolled in the remote patient monitoring system after undergoing cardiac surgery. The medical devices recorded vital parameters, such as blood pressure, pulse rate, saturation, body temperature, blood glucose, and electrocardiography were measured via the Health Monitor DakikApp and Holter ECG DakikApp devices which reported data to web-based software and a mobile application (DakikApp Mobile Systems, Remscheid, Germany). During the follow-up period, patients were contacted daily through text and voice messages, and video conferences. Remote Medical Evaluations (RMEs) concerning patients' medical states were performed. Medication reminders, daily treatment were communicated to the patients with the DakikApp Mobile Systems Software. RESULTS During a mean follow-up period of 78.9 ± 107.1 (10-395) days, a total of 135,786 patient contacts were recorded (782 video conferences, 2805 voice messaging, and 132,199 text correspondence). The number of RMEs handled by the Telemedicine Team was 79,560. A total of 105,335 vital parameter measurements were performed and 5024 hospital application requests (6.3% per RME) were addressed successfully and hospitalization was avoided. A total of 144 (6.1%) potentially life-threatening complications were found to have been diagnosed early using the Telemedicine System. CONCLUSION Remote Patient Monitoring Systems combined with professional medical devices are feasible, effective, and safe for the purpose of improving postoperative outcomes.","Atilgan, Kıvanç; Onuk, Burak E; Köksal Coşkun, Pınar; Yeşi L, Fahri G; Aslan, Cemal; Çolak, Abdullah; Çelebi, Aksüyek S; Bozbaş, Hüseyin",Journal of cardiac surgery,231,1

Mesonivirus replicative proteins are produced from large polyprotein (pp) precursors (pp1a and pp1ab) through proteolytic cleavage by the viral 3C-like protease (3CLpro) and, possibly, other proteases. Using recombinant forms of the Cavally virus 3CLpro and pp1a/pp1ab-derived substrates, we characterized 3CLpro cleavage sites in mesonivirus polyproteins. Our data lead us to suggest that 3CLpro cleaves the central and C-proximal regions of mesonivirus pp1a/pp1ab at 12 conserved sites. Compared to other nidovirus homologues, the mesonivirus 3CLpro features a distinct substrate specificity, with asparagine at P2 being a major specificity determinant. Furthermore, we provide evidence that expression of the ORF1b-encoded part of pp1ab involves a -1 ribosomal frameshift at a conserved GGAUUUU heptanucleotide sequence in the ORF1a/1b overlap region. Taken together, the study identifies critical steps in the expression and maturation of mesonivirus replicative proteins.","Blanck, Sandra; Ziebuhr, John",The Journal of general virology,231,23

MATERIALS AND METHODS Fifty-two hospitalized patients with pandemic influenza (H1N1) were included in the study. All of the patients underwent chest radiography, and 28 patients were also evaluated by thoracic CT. Group 1 comprised 24 (46%) patients with no identified risk factors for H1N1 influenza infection. Group 2 comprised the remaining 28 (54%) patients with identified risk factors. The distribution of lung involvement, consolidation, ground-glass opacity (GGO), lymph nodes, and pleural effusion were evaluated. RESULTS Abnormal findings were observed in 85% of the patients. Bilateral lung involvement was present in 80% of the patients. The most common finding was a mixture of GGO and air-space consolidation. Lower zone predominance occurred in 89% of group 1 and 85% of group 2 patients. The involvement was observed most frequently in the peripheral and central perihilar areas of the lung in 80% of the patients. The extent of disease was greater in group 2 patients with the involvement of three or more lung zones in 62% of the patients. CONCLUSION The most common imaging finding for lung involvement was a mixture of air-space consolidation and GGO with a patchy pattern and lower/middle zone predominance. Pulmonary involvement of the disease was more extensive than that described in previous reports.","Karadeli, Elif; Koç, Zafer; Ulusan, Serife; Erbay, Gürcan; Demiroğlu, Yusuf Ziya; Sen, Nazan",Diagnostic and interventional radiology,231,30

Surgical approaches and patient-related co-morbidity have also been suggested as risk factors for development of TSH. The aim of the present review was to perform a qualitative systematic analysis to estimate the incidence of TSH and to discuss the surgical and patient-related risk factors for development of TSH. METHODS The literature search was until 19 May 2010. Studies with TSH, defined as either operation for TSH or a hernia found during clinical follow-up, were included. We included randomised controlled trials, prospective non-controlled studies including >200 patients, and retrospective studies including >200 patients. The review was completed according to the PRISMA guidelines. RESULTS We included 19 studies in adults and 3 studies in paediatric patients (<18 years), and a total of 30,568 adults and 1,098 children were analysed. The overall incidence of TSH was 0-5.2%. TSH occurred most often (96%) in trocar sites of a minimum of 10 mm, located mostly in the umbilicus region (82%). Data supported a higher incidence of TSH when the trocar site fascia was not sutured, and in pre-school children undergoing a laparoscopic procedure. CONCLUSIONS Current data suggests a relatively low incidence of TSH but that all trocar incisions of a minimum of 10 mm should be closed. In pre-school children undergoing laparoscopic surgery, all port sites should be closed.","Helgstrand, F; Rosenberg, J; Bisgaard, T",Hernia : the journal of hernias and abdominal wall surgery,231,1

Currently, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is spreading rapidly around the globe. For many years we have been warned that we would face a new pandemic, most likely with a zoonotic virus. For COVID-19 it was shown that transmission can occur via droplets and aerosols that can remain in the air for some hours and also via contaminated surfaces. Extra risks have been suggested to exists for aerosol producing surgery in sinus- and skull-base surgery. Ongoing transmission is especially difficult to prevent when the pathogen can be transmitted during the incubation period before the patient experiences symptoms. In March, Claire Hopkins and colleagues warned the rhinologic community and later health authorities about the significant increase in anosmia (and dysgeusia) related to (often further) asymptomatic COVID-19 and pointed to the possibility of recognizing COVID-19 patients by unexplained anosmia without other symptoms.","Fokkens, W J",Rhinology,231,28

Seventy-four COVID-19 positive and 228 COVID-19 negative patients were evaluated with routine haematological parameters. Severe disease was defined as death and/or need of intensive care treatment. Twenty-seven COVID-19 positive and 18 COVID-19 negative patients were furthermore included for morphological evaluation using smear examination. Significant differences were found for platelet indices and white blood cell parameters. Thus, platelet count and plateletcrit was lower in COVID-19 patients, whilst mean platelet volume, platelet distribution width, and platelet large cell ratio was significantly higher than in non-COVID-19 patients. Leukocyte, neutrophil, immature granulocyte, lymphocyte, monocyte, eosinophil, and basophil count was lower in COVID-19 patients. No significant differences were found for red blood cell count, haemoglobin, haematocrit or mean corpuscular haemoglobin for COVID-19 versus non-COVID-19 patients. COVID-19 patients with a severe disease course had higher levels of immature granulocytes, but lower lymphocyte and platelet counts compared to patients with non-severe COVID-19. In terms of morphology, 14.8% of COVID-19 patients had a normal smear examination, compared to 83.3% of non-COVID-19 patients. Hypogranulated neutrophils were more frequent in COVID-19 patients (p < .001), but non-COVID-19 patients had higher levels of reactive lymphocytes, compared to COVID-19 patients. In conclusion, several haematological morphological abnormalities are more frequent in patients with COVID-19 disease, and several findings indicate that platelets play a fundamental role in the pathophysiology of the disease.","Alnor, Anne; Sandberg, Maria Boysen; Toftanes, Barbara Ella; Vinholt, Pernille Just",Scandinavian journal of clinical and laboratory investigation,231,5

The growing pandemic of COVID-19 disease requires social distancing and personal hygiene measures to protect public health. But this message is not clear and well understood among people. The aim of this study is to determine the awareness, knowledge and attitude about COVID-19 and relate the behaviour of Indian society, especially when the country is restarting all its economic activities, after the complete lockdown. METHOD The present paper is based on an extensive survey among 21 406 adult participants of various sections of Indian society with different age groups between 18 and 80 years to introspect the level of public awareness with respect to cause, spread, prevention and treatment of disease caused by spread of COVID-19 viral outbreak, which will be automatically reflected in the societal behavioural response of rigorous precautionary measures. CONCLUSIONS There is a need to extend the knowledge base among individuals to enhance their active participation in the prevention mechanisms with respect to the spread of the pandemic. There is a need to elaborate the Indian socio-cultural aspects, so that society starts appreciating and voluntarily following social distancing. This should improve the adaptability of people with livelihood resilience to let them protect themselves not only from the present pandemic but also from all other unforeseen infections, and to provide care to patients.","Kaushik, Manish; Agarwal, Divya; Gupta, Anil K",Postgraduate medical journal,231,6

Autonomy is 'king' of the principles espoused and operationalised in consent. Consent is the mechanism by which all medical interactions occur. In borderline personality disorder (BPD) there is often a diffuse sense of self, emotional instability and impulsivity that can lead to medically dangerous non-suicidal self-injury, acute medical intervention and then a withdrawal of consent while the potential threat to the person's well-being remains high. Claims of lack of capacity lack veracity, and simply acting against the patient's will may be illegal. Understanding the will and preferences of patients is a step forward, but it is not always possible in time-sensitive situations. A cautious paternalism is therefore warranted both to ensure the patient's well-being while being honest as to the reasons for this, and to possibly build epistemic trust between the medical system and the patient with BPD.","Newton-Howes, Giles",BJPsych bulletin,231,19

OBJECTIVE The objective was to understand the relation between maternal BMI and human-milk energy, fat, and/or total protein. METHODS Four electronic databases (MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, and Web of Science) were searched. Outcomes assessed were human-milk energy (kcal/L), fat (g/L), and total protein (g/L) from mothers 1 to 6 mo postpartum. Studies with data on maternal BMI or weight and height that quantified human-milk energy, fat, or protein between 1 and 6 mo postpartum were eligible. Random-effects meta-regression weighted by the inverse of the study-level SE was completed for each of the 3 outcomes. The certainty of evidence for each outcome was assessed using the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation) approach. RESULTS A total of 11,373 titles and abstracts were identified, and after full-text screening, 69 articles of 66 studies were included. Meta-regression results showed a positive association between maternal BMI and human-milk fat (β: 0.56 g/L; 95% CI: 0.034, 1.1; P = 0.04; I2 = 93.7%, n = 63 datapoints). There was no significant association between maternal BMI and human-milk energy (β: 3.9 kcal/L; 95% CI: -1.6, 9.5; P = 0.16, I2 = 93.3%, n = 40 datapoints) or total protein (β: 0.13 g/L; 95% CI: -0.16, 0.41; P = 0.37, I2 = 99.1%, n = 40 datapoints). The certainty of evidence for human-milk energy was low and the certainty of evidence for fat and total protein was very low. CONCLUSIONS Meta-regression analysis of available literature suggested an association between maternal BMI and human-milk fat between 1 and 6 mo postpartum.

The digital close-range photogrammetry is used to obtain monitoring data. The error compensation method is used to optimize the center of the monitoring point. Aiming at the limitations of back propagation neural network (BPNN), a genetic algorithm (GA)-optimized BPNN algorithm is proposed. Then, the optimized algorithm is applied to predict the deformation and displacement of foundation pits from three aspects, i.e., simple horizontal displacement, simple longitudinal displacement, and the combination of horizontal and longitudinal displacements. Meanwhile, the time domain, space domain, and time-space domain are used as input features to compare the prediction results of the BPNN model and the GA-optimized BPNN model. Finally, the GA-improved BPNN is compared with the Support Vector Regression (SVR) model and Random Forest (RF) model. The results show that the prediction result, obtained by simultaneously using horizontal displacement and longitudinal displacement as input features, has smaller errors; also, the actual output is closer to the expected output. Compared with the prediction result with time domain and space domain as input features, the prediction result with time-space domain as input features is closer to the expected output. Taking the combination of time and space domains as input features, compared with the BPNN model, the GA-optimized BPNN model has a lower Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) value (0.0163), a larger Index of Agreement (IA) value (0.9800), and a shorter training time (7.08 s). Compared with the SVR model and RF model, the GA-improved BPNN model has a lower Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) value (0.0211), a larger Index of Agreement (IA) value (0.9706), and shorter training time (7.61 s). Therefore, the foundation pit deformation prediction model based on BPNN and GA has strong prediction ability, which can be popularized and applied in similar geotechnical engineering.","Luo, Jie; Ren, Ran; Guo, Kangde",PloS one,231,17

The adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase) activity of KaiC is the source of the 24-h period and temperature compensation. Although numerous circadian mutants of KaiC have been identified, the tuning mechanism of the 24-h period remains unclear. Here, we show that the circadian period of in vitro phosphorylation rhythm of mutants at position 402 of KaiC changed dramatically, from 15 h (0.6 d) to 158 h (6.6 d). The ATPase activities of mutants at position 402 of KaiC, without KaiA and KaiB, correlated with the frequencies (1/period), indicating that KaiC structure was the source of extra period change. Despite the wide-range tunability, temperature compensation of both the circadian period and the KaiC ATPase activity of mutants at position 402 of KaiC were nearly intact. We also found that in vivo and in vitro circadian periods and the KaiC ATPase activity of mutants at position 402 of KaiC showed a correlation with the side-chain volume of the amino acid at position 402 of KaiC. Our results indicate that residue 402 is a key position of determining the circadian period of cyanobacteria, and it is possible to dramatically alter the period of KaiC while maintaining temperature compensation.","Ito-Miwa, Kumiko; Furuike, Yoshihiko; Akiyama, Shuji; Kondo, Takao",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,231,16

METHODS We studied 68 patients who had a novel technique performed in laparoscopic radical prostatectomy (knotless group) and 89 who had the conventional single knot technique (single knot group). The operations were all performed by novice laparoscopists with experience of fewer than 100 cases of laparoscopic radical prostatectomy. Knotless suture of the dorsal vein complex was conducted using a barbed self-retaining suture with three bites at the same location. The knotless urethrovesical anastomosis technique was conducted using a unidirectional single running fashion with a barbed self-retaining suture. RESULTS There were no significant differences in the estimated blood loss, complication rate, postoperative hospital stay, anastomotic leakage rate, continence at 6 months after surgery, and positive margin rate between the two groups. The mean anastomotic time (24.9 vs. 44.2 min), operative time (168.1 vs. 201.8 min), and duration of catheter placement (12.8 vs. 19.8 days) were shorter in the knotless group than in the single-knot group.

However, the effect of microcirculation variation on the vascular system is unclear. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies to quantify associations of retinal microvascular caliber (arteriolar, venular caliber, arteriole-to-venule ratio) and preclinical CV measures (large arterial function and structure). METHODS We identified studies in Medline, Embase and Pubmed (1946 to March 2018) studying (a) general population samples and (b) patients with cardiometabolic disease. Study-specific correlation estimates were combined into meta-analysis where possible. RESULTS Of 1,294 studies identified, 26 met inclusion criteria (general population 16, patients 10), of which five studies were included in meta-analysis. Most studied middle-aged adults cross-sectionally, with one childhood study. Large arterial function and structure were predominantly assessed by pulse wave velocity and carotid intima-media thickness, respectively. Only arteriolar caliber was consistently associated with arterial function and structure, with stronger associations observed in cardiometabolic patients. Narrower (worse) arteriolar caliber was associated with faster (poorer) pulse wave velocity (correlation coefficient (r) -0.17, 95% CI -0.25 to -0.10) and greater (poorer) intima-media thickness (r -0.05, 95%CI -0.09 to -0.02) across all adult participants. CONCLUSIONS Retinal arteriolar, but not venular caliber, was modestly associated with large arterial function and weakly associated with large arterial structure, with stronger evidence in patients with cardiometabolic disease. This suggests that preclinical changes in large arteries and the microcirculation have some shared but mainly unique pathway to associate with cardiovascular disease.

The sample consisted of 4661 adults aged 30 years or above, and was chosen from the 2017 Korean National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (KNHANES) data. Of all the subjects, 14.6% engaged in high-intensity DWPA and 6.25% in moderate-intensity DWPA; while 11.68% and 24.80% engaged in high- and moderate-intensity LTPA, respectively. The effects of both types of physical activities on the risk of diabetes were analyzed using a Bayesian ordered probit model. For those with high-intensity DWPA, the probability of the FBG level being normal was 5.10% (SE = 0.25) lower than for those with non-high-intensity DWPA, and the probabilities of IFG and diabetes were 3.30% (SE = 0.15) and 1.79% (SE = 0.09) higher, respectively. However, for those with high-intensity LTPA, the probability of the FBG level being normal was 2.54% (SE = 0.09) higher, and the probabilities of IFG and diabetes were 1.74% (SE = 0.07) and 0.80% (SE = 0.03) lower, respectively, than those with non-high-intensity LTPA. Likewise, for moderate-intensity DWPA and LTPA, the results were the same compared to low-intensity physical activities though the magnitude of the effects were smaller than for high-intensity. Thus, the activities related to work have a negative effect and those related to leisure have a positive effect. The criteria for physical activities to reduce the risk of diabetes should be set by separating these domains of physical activity, and new management strategies for diabetes are needed for people with moderate- or high-intensity DWPA.","Oh, Hyun Sook",International journal of environmental research and public health,231,20

We hypothesized that azithromycin is superior to SXT for UFI treatment, but the drugs are non-inferior to each other for culture-confirmed enteric fever treatment. METHODS We conducted a double blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial of azithromycin (20 mg/kg/day) or SXT (trimethoprim 10 mg/kg/day + sulfamethoxazole 50 mg/kg/day) orally for 7 days for UFI treatment in Nepal. We enrolled patients (aged 3-64 years) presenting to two Kathmandu hospitals with temperature ≥ 38.0°C for ≥4 days without localising signs. The primary endpoint was fever clearance time (FCT); secondary endpoints were treatment failure and adverse events. ClinicalTrials.gov number: NCT02773407. RESULTS From June 2016 to May 2019, we randomized 326 participants (163 in each arm); 87 (26.7%) had blood culture-confirmed enteric fever. In all participants, the median FCT was 2.7 days (95% CI 2.6-3.3) in the SXT arm and 2.1 days (95% CI 1.6-3.2) in the azithromycin arm 1.25 (95% CI 0.99-1.58, P=0.059). The hazard ratio of treatment failures by 28 days between azithromycin and SXT was 0.62 (95% CI 0.37-1.05, p=0.073). Planned sub-group analysis showed azithromycin resulted in faster FCT in those with sterile blood cultures and less relapses in culture-confirmed enteric fever. Nausea, vomiting, constipation, and headache were more common in the SXT arm. CONCLUSIONS Despite similar FCT and treatment failure in the two arms, significantly fewer complications and relapses make azithromycin a better choice for empirical treatment of UFI in Nepal.","Giri, Abhishek; Karkey, Abhilasha; Dangol, Sabina; Arjyal, Amit; Pokharel, Sunil; Rijal, Samita; Gajurel, Damodar; Sharma, Rabi; Lamsal, Kamal; Shrestha, Pradip; Prajapati, Gayatri; Pathak, Saruna; Shrestha, Sita Ram; K C, Raj Kumar; Pandey, Sujata; Thapa, Abishkar; Shrestha, Nistha; Thapa, Raj Kumar; Poudyal, Buddhi; Phuong, Dung Nguyen Thi; Baker, Stephen; Kestelyn, Evelyne; Geskus, Ronald; Thwaites, Guy; Basnyat, Buddha",Clinical infectious diseases : an official publication of the Infectious Diseases Society of America,231,1

Their immunosuppressive effect might be valuable in patients with COVID-19 characterised by substantial immune system dysfunction by controlling inflammation and promoting disease tolerance. OBJECTIVES To assess the effect of IL-6 blocking agents compared to standard care alone or with placebo on efficacy and safety outcomes in COVID-19. We will update this assessment regularly. SEARCH METHODS We searched the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (up to 11 February 2021) and the L-OVE platform, and Cochrane COVID-19 Study Register to identify trials up to 26 February 2021. SELECTION CRITERIA We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating IL-6 blocking agents compared with standard care alone or with placebo for people with COVID-19, regardless of disease severity. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS We followed standard Cochrane methodology. The protocol was amended to reduce the number of outcomes considered. Two review authors independently collected data and assessed the risk of bias with the Cochrane Risk of Bias 2 tool. We rated the certainty of evidence with the GRADE approach for the critical outcomes such as clinical improvement (defined as hospital discharge or improvement on the scale used by trialists to evaluate clinical progression or recovery) (day (D) 28 / ≥ D60); WHO Clinical Progression Score of level 7 or above (i.e. the proportion of participants with mechanical ventilation +/- additional organ support OR death) (D28 / ≥ D60); all-cause mortality (D28 / ≥ D60); incidence of any adverse events; and incidence of serious adverse events. MAIN RESULTS We identified 10 RCTs with available data including one platform trial comparing tocilizumab and sarilumab with standard of care. These trials evaluated tocilizumab (nine RCTs including two platform trials; seven were reported as peer-reviewed articles, two as preprints; 6428 randomised participants); and two sarilumab (one platform trial reported as peer reviewed article, one reported as preprint, 880 randomised participants). All trials included were multicentre trials. They were conducted in Brazil, China, France, Italy, UK, USA, and four were multi-country trials. The mean age range of participants ranged from 56 to 65 years; 4572 (66.3%) of trial participants were male. Disease severity ranged from mild to critical disease. The reported proportion of participants on oxygen at baseline but not intubated varied from 56% to 100% where reported. Five trials reported the inclusion of intubated patients at baseline. We identified a further 20 registered RCTs of tocilizumab compared to placebo/standard care (five completed without available results, five terminated without available results, eight ongoing, two not recruiting); 11 RCTs of sarilumab (two completed without results, three terminated without available results, six ongoing); six RCTs of clazakisumab (five ongoing, one not recruiting); two RCTs of olokizumab (one completed, one not recruiting); one of siltuximab (ongoing) and one RCT of levilimab (completed without available results). Of note, three were cancelled (2 tocilizumab, 1 clazakisumab). One multiple-arm RCT evaluated both tocilizumab and sarilumab compared to standard of care, one three-arm RCT evaluated tocilizumab and siltuximab compared to standard of care and consequently they appear in each respective comparison. Tocilizumab versus standard care alone or with placebo a. Effectiveness of tocilizumab for patients with COVID-19 Tocilizumab probably results in little or no increase in the outcome of clinical improvement at D28 (RR 1.06, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.13; I2 = 40.9%; 7 RCTs, 5585 participants; absolute effect: 31 more with clinical improvement per 1000 (from 0 fewer to 67 more); moderate-certainty evidence). However, we cannot exclude that some subgroups of patients could benefit from the treatment. We did not obtain data for longer-term follow-up (≥ D60). The effect of tocilizumab on the proportion of participants with a WHO Clinical Progression Score of level of 7 or above is uncertain at D28 (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.56 to 1.74; I2 = 64.4%; 3 RCTs, 712 participants; low-certainty evidence). We did not obtain data for longer-term follow-up (≥ D60). Tocilizumab reduces all-cause mortality at D28 compared to standard care alone or placebo (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.82 to 0.97; I2 = 0.0%; 8 RCTs, 6363 participants; absolute effect: 32 fewer deaths per 1000 (from 52 fewer to 9 fewer); high-certainty evidence). The evidence suggests uncertainty around the effect on mortality at ≥ D60 (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.53 to 1.40; I2 = 0.0%; 2 RCTs, 519 participants; low-certainty evidence). b. Safety of tocilizumab for patients with COVID-19 The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of tocilizumab on adverse events (RR 1.23, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.72; I2 = 86.4%; 7 RCTs, 1534 participants; very low-certainty evidence). Nevertheless, tocilizumab probably results in slightly fewer serious adverse events than standard care alone or placebo (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.75 to 1.06; I2 = 0.0%; 8 RCTs, 2312 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). Sarilumab versus standard care alone or with placebo The evidence is uncertain about the effect of sarilumab on all-cause mortality at D28 (RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.43 to 1.36; 2 RCTs, 880 participants; low certainty), on all-cause mortality at ≥ D60 (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.50 to 2.0; 1 RCT, 420 participants; low certainty), and serious adverse events (RR 1.17, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.77; 2 RCTs, 880 participants; low certainty). It is unlikely that sarilumab results in an important increase of adverse events (RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.25; 1 RCT, 420 participants; moderate certainty). However, an increase cannot be excluded No data were available for other critical outcomes. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS On average, tocilizumab reduces all-cause mortality at D28 compared to standard care alone or placebo and probably results in slightly fewer serious adverse events than standard care alone or placebo. Nevertheless, tocilizumab probably results in little or no increase in the outcome clinical improvement (defined as hospital discharge or improvement measured by trialist-defined scales) at D28. The impact of tocilizumab on other outcomes is uncertain or very uncertain. With the data available, we were not able to explore heterogeneity. Individual patient data meta-analyses are needed to be able to identify which patients are more likely to benefit from this treatment. Evidence for an effect of sarilumab is uncertain and evidence for other anti-IL6 agents is unavailable. Thirty-nine RCTs of IL-6 blocking agents with no results are currently registered, of which nine are completed and seven trials were terminated with no results available. The findings of this review will be updated as new data are made available on the COVID-NMA platform (covid-nma.com).","Ghosn, Lina; Chaimani, Anna; Evrenoglou, Theodoros; Davidson, Mauricia; Graña, Carolina; Schmucker, Christine; Bollig, Claudia; Henschke, Nicholas; Sguassero, Yanina; Nejstgaard, Camilla Hansen; Menon, Sonia; Nguyen, Thu Van; Ferrand, Gabriel; Kapp, Philipp; Riveros, Carolina; Ávila, Camila; Devane, Declan; Meerpohl, Joerg J; Rada, Gabriel; Hróbjartsson, Asbjørn; Grasselli, Giacomo; Tovey, David; Ravaud, Philippe; Boutron, Isabelle",The Cochrane database of systematic reviews,231,33

However, it also has some disadvantages such as limitation of movement and clashing of the hand instruments, which increase the complexity and technical challenges of the operation. In this study, we describe a pilot trial of single-incision laparoscopic cholecystectomy through a paramedian access site. MATERIAL AND METHODS A total of 25 patients underwent single-incision laparoscopic cholecystectomy with this method. Acute cases with empyema and patients with history of previous abdominal surgery were excluded. Single-incision is established on the right upper quadrant, right latero-superior of the umbilicus, so that trocar sites and projection of the gallbladder on the abdominal wall are on the same vertical line. Standard laparoscopic instruments were placed into the abdominal cavity providing triangulation. Once the laparoscope, grasper, and dissector are in place, the overall procedures are similar to the standard laparoscopic cholecystectomy. RESULTS Single-incision laparoscopic cholecystectomy through an extraumbilical access site was successfully completed in all 25 patients without conversion to open surgery. Additional skin incisions and trocar access were required only in two patients. The mean operative time was 39.3 min (range: 20-75 min). The mean body mass index was 27.2. Postoperative course was uneventful in all patients. The mean postoperative hospital stay was shorter than 24 h, and all patients were discharged at first day postoperatively. No postoperative complications including seroma, wound infection, and trocar-site hernia were observed at 6-month follow-up. CONCLUSION We described a new access site for single-incision laparoscopic cholecystectomy using standard laparoscopic instruments. We believe that this type of access site overcomes the technical difficulties of performing single-incision laparoscopic cholecystectomy, and it is a promising alternative method for the treatment of patients with symptomatic gallstone disease as a minimal invasive abdominal surgery.","Oruc, M T; Ugurlu, M U",Scandinavian journal of surgery : SJS : official organ for the Finnish Surgical Society and the Scandinavian Surgical Society,231,24

Due to ever increasing experience and expertise, many large international centers now offer robotic-assisted pancreatic surgery as a preferred alternative. In general however, pancreatic operations are still associated with high morbidity and mortality, while robotic-assisted techniques still require significant learning curves. As a prospective post-marketing trial, we have established optimized operating procedures at our clinic. This manuscript intends to publicize our standardized methodology, including pre-operative preparation, surgical set-up as well as the surgeons' step-by-step actions when using pancreatic-assisted robotic surgery. This manuscript is based on our institutional experience as a high-volume pancreas operating center. We introduce novel concepts that should standardize, facilitate and economize the surgical steps in all types of robotic-assisted pancreatic surgery. The ""One Fits All"" principle enables single port placement irrespective of the pancreatic procedure, while the ""Reversed 6-to-6 Approach"" offers an optimized manual for pancreatic surgeons using the robotic console. Novel and standardized surgical concepts could guide new centers to establish a robust, efficient and safe robotic-assisted pancreatic surgery program.","Felsenstein, Matthäus; Hillebrandt, Karl H; Timmermann, Lea; Feist, Mathilde; Benzing, Christian; Schmelzle, Moritz; Pratschke, Johann; Malinka, Thomas",Journal of robotic surgery,231,5

The aim of this study is to assess the safety and efficacy of a new articulating vessel sealer for laparoscopic hepatectomy. Our hypothesis was that this new device would facilitate parenchymal transection and reduce intraoperative costs in laparoscopic hepatectomy. METHODS Within 18 months, a 5 cm bipolar articulating vessel sealer was used in 32 laparoscopic liver resections (LLR). By excluding 4 patients who underwent concomitant colorectal resections, the outcomes of the remaining 28 patients (group 1) were compared with 28 patients who underwent LLR by the same surgical group using other energy devices (group 2). RESULTS Tumor type was malignant in 71% of patients (n=20) in group 1 and 89% of the patients (n=25) in group 2 (P=0.360). The number and size of tumors were similar in both groups, as well as the type of resections performed. In group 1, there was a less number of adjunctive devices (ie, energy, clip appliers, staplers) used (median 2) compared with group 2 (median 3, P=0.032). Parenchymal transection time (mean±SEM 28.2±3.5 vs. 55.2±4.1 min, respectively, P<0.001) and total operative time (200.1±13.7 vs. 242.7±14.4 min, respectively, P=0.036) were shorter for group 1 versus group 2. Estimated blood loss, transfusion rate, margin status, and length of stay were similar between the groups. There was no mortality. Morbidity was 11% (n=3) in group 1 and 18% (n=5) in group 2 (P=NS). The overall intraoperative costs were an average of $3000 less in group 1 (95% confidence interval, $1090-$4930, P=0.0029) compared with group 2. CONCLUSIONS This study demonstrates the safety and efficacy of a new energy device for LLR. Our experience suggested that this new device provided the functionality of both a vessel sealer and a stapler with its large jaw and articulation.","Dural, Cem; Akyuz, Muhammet; Yazici, Pinar; Aksoy, Erol; Aucejo, Federico; Quintini, Cristiano; Miller, Charles; Fung, John; Berber, Eren","Surgical laparoscopy, endoscopy & percutaneous techniques",231,8

The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of neck extension on the advancement of tracheal tubes from the nasal cavity into the oropharynx during nasotracheal intubation. METHODS Patients were randomized to the 'neck extension group (E group)' or 'neutral position group (N group)' for this randomized controlled trial. After induction of anesthesia, a nasal RAE tube was inserted via a nostril. For the E group, an anesthesiologist advanced the tube from the nasal cavity into the oropharynx with the patient's neck extended. For the N group, an anesthesiologist advanced the tube without neck extension. If the tube was successfully advanced into the oropharynx within two attempts by the same maneuver according to the assigned group, the case was defined as 'success.' We compared the success rate of tube advancement between the two groups. RESULTS Thirty-two patients in the E group and 33 in the N group completed the trial. The success rate of tube passage during the first two attempts was significantly higher in the E group than in the N group (93.8% vs. 60.6%; odds ratio = 9.75, 95% CI = [1.98, 47.94], p = 0.002).

The authors evaluated their initial experience using a dual-lumen balloon to facilitate preoperative embolization in 5 consecutive patients who underwent preoperative transarterial Onyx embolization assisted by the Scepter dual-lumen balloon catheter between 2012 and 2014. OBJECT The authors reviewed the demographic and clinical records of 5 patients who underwent Scepter-assisted Onyx embolization of a paraganglioma followed by resection between 2012 and 2014. Descriptive statistics of clinical outcomes were assessed. RESULTS Five patients (4 with a jugular and 1 with a vagal paraganglioma) were identified. Three paragangliomas were embolized in a single session, and each of the other 2 were completed in 3 staged sessions. The mean volume of Onyx used was 14.3 ml (range 6-30 ml). Twenty-seven vessels were selectively catheterized for embolization. All patients required selective embolization via multiple vessels. Two patients required sacrifice of parent vessels (1 petrocavernous internal carotid artery and 1 vertebral artery) after successful balloon test occlusion. One patient underwent embolization with Onyx-18 alone, 2 with Onyx-34 alone, and 1 with Onyx-18 and -34. In each case, migration of Onyx was achieved within the tumor parenchyma. The mean time between embolization and resection was 3.8 days (range 1-8 days). Gross-total resection was achieved in 3 (60%) patients, and the other 2 patients had minimal residual tumor. The mean estimated blood loss during the resections was 556 ml (range 200-850 ml). The mean postoperative hematocrit level change was -17.3%. Two patients required blood transfusions. One patient, who underwent extensive tumor penetration with Onyx, developed a temporary partial cranial nerve VII palsy that resolved to House-Brackmann Grade I (out of VI) at the 6-month follow-up. One patient experienced improvement in existing facial nerve weakness after embolization. CONCLUSIONS Scepter catheter-based Onyx embolization seems to be safe and effective. It was associated with excellent distal tumor vasculature penetration and holds promise as an adjunct to conventional transarterial Onyx embolization of paragangliomas. However, the ease of tumor penetration should encourage caution in practitioners who may be able to effect comparable improvement in blood loss with more conservative proximal Onyx penetration.","Ladner, Travis R; He, Lucy; Davis, Brandon J; Yang, George L; Wanna, George B; Mocco, J",Journal of neurosurgery,231,17

New evidence indicates that irisin protects the heart against myocardial ischemic injury. However, whether irisin enhances cardiac progenitor cell (CPC)-induced cardiac repair remains unknown. This study examines the effect of irisin on CPC-induced cardiac repair when these cells are introduced into the infarcted myocardium. Nkx2.5+ CPC stable cells were isolated from mouse embryonic stem cells. Nkx2.5 + CPCs (0.5 × 10 6 ) were reintroduced into the infarcted myocardium using PEGlylated fibrin delivery. The mouse myocardial infarction model was created by permanent ligation of the left anterior descending (LAD) artery. Nkx2.5 + CPCs were pretreated with irisin at a concentration of 5 ng/ml in vitro for 24 hr before transplantation. Myocardial functions were evaluated by echocardiographic measurement. Eight weeks after engraftment, Nkx2.5 + CPCs improved ventricular function as evident by an increase in ejection fraction and fractional shortening. These findings are concomitant with the suppression of cardiac hypertrophy and attenuation of myocardial interstitial fibrosis. Transplantation of Nkx2.5 + CPCs promoted cardiac regeneration and neovascularization, which were increased with the pretreatment of Nkx2.5 + CPCs with irisin. Furthermore, irisin treatment promoted myocyte proliferation as indicated by proliferative markers Ki67 and phosphorylated histone 3 and decreased apoptosis. Additionally, irisin resulted in a marked reduction of histone deacetylase 4 and increased p38 acetylation in cultured CPCs. These results indicate that irisin promoted Nkx2.5 + CPC-induced cardiac regeneration and functional improvement and that irisin serves as a novel therapeutic approach for stem cells in cardiac repair.","Zhao, Yu Tina; Wang, Jianguo; Yano, Naohiro; Zhang, Ling X; Wang, Hao; Zhang, Shouyan; Qin, Gangjian; Dubielecka, Patrycja M; Zhuang, Shougang; Liu, Paul Y; Chin, Y Eugene; Zhao, Ting C",Journal of cellular physiology,231,1

Despite an incidence rate of 0.02% in the vaccine arm of the Moderna mRNA-1273 trial, concerns have been expressed about the association of adverse reactions following soft tissue filler injections and the COVID-19 vaccines. The International Society for Dermatologic and Aesthetic Surgery (ISDS) understands these concerns and has designed the following study. METHODS A global survey was designed to capture the incidence of adverse events related to: (1) previous soft tissue filler injections, (2) soft tissue filler injections during positive testing for COVID-19, and (3) soft tissue filler injections during and after receiving any of the COVID-19 vaccines globally available. RESULTS The information of 106 survey participants from 18 different countries was analyzed. 80.2% (n=85) never experienced any adverse reaction following their soft tissue filler injection whereas 15.1% (n=16) experienced swelling and 4.7% (n=5) experienced pain that lasted longer than two days. Of those who received at least one dose of the COVID-19 vaccine (n=78), 94.9% reported not to have experienced any adverse reaction related to their previous soft tissue filler injection, whereas 5.1% (n=4) reported to have perceived pain that lasted longer than two days. CONCLUSION The data collected does not support the concern for an increased risk of developing adverse reactions following soft tissue filler injections associated with the COVID-19 vaccines compared to that risk associated with other previously described triggers or the default risk following soft tissue filler injections.

We aimed to compare BLS/automated external defibrillator (AED) skill performance and skill retention following training with the 2010 or 2015 BLS/AED guidelines. Methods Post-hoc analysis of two randomised simulation trials including videorecordings of laypersons skill-tested after ERC BLS/AED training using either the 2010 (n = 70) or 2015 (n = 70) BLS guidelines. Outcomes: (a) correct sequence of the BLS/AED algorithm, (b) correct sequence of the BLS/AED algorithm with all skills performed correctly, and (c) time to EMS call, first chest compression and shock delivery immediately after training and three months later. Groups were compared using multivariate logistic regression. Results Mean age (±standard deviation) was 40 (±11) vs. 44 (±11) years and 70% vs. 50% were females for the 2010 and 2015 groups, respectively. Correct sequence of the BLS/AED algorithm for the 2010 vs. 2015 group was 84% vs. 91%, P = 0.08 immediately after training and 16% vs. 41%, adjusted odds ratio (aOR): 5.6 (95% CI: 2.3-14.0, P < 0.001) after three months. Correct sequence with all skills performed correctly was 56% vs. 47%, P = 0.31 immediately after training and 5% vs. 16%, aOR: 4.8 (95% CI: 1.2-19.2), P = 0.03 after three months. Time to EMS call was shorter in the 2015 group immediately after training (P = 0.008) but all other time points did not differ. Conclusion The simplified 2015 BLS guidelines was associated with better adherence to the sequence of the BLS/AED algorithm when compared to the 2010 BLS guidelines three months after training in a simulated cardiac arrest scenario, without significantly improving skill performance immediately after training.","Nguyen, Dung Thuy; Lauridsen, Kasper Glerup; Krogh, Kristian; Løfgren, Bo",Resuscitation plus,231,10

Black, Indigenous, and People of Color (BIPOC) have long experienced structural racism and oppression, resulting in disproportionately high rates of trauma, poverty, and chronic diseases that span generations and are associated with increased COVID-19 morbidity and mortality rates. The current pandemic, with the potential of conferring new trauma exposure, interacts with and exacerbates existing disparities. To assist mental health professionals in offering more comprehensive services and programs for those who have minimal resources and the most profound barriers to care, four critical areas are highlighted as being historically problematic and essential to address: (a) recognizing psychology's role in institutionalizing disparities; (b) examining race/ethnicity as a critical variable; (c) proactively tackling growing mental health problems amidst the COVID-19 crisis; and (d) understanding the importance of incorporating historical trauma and discrimination in research and practice.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, a significant number of patients have required hospital admission to tertiary referral centres for concomitant mechanical ventilation and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). Nevertheless, the management of ventilated patients on circulatory support can be quite challenging. Therefore, we sought to review the management of these patients based on the analysis of haemodynamic and energetic parameters using numerical simulations generated by a software package named CARDIOSIM©. METHODS New modules of the systemic circulation and ECMO were implemented in CARDIOSIM© platform. This is a modular software simulator of the cardiovascular system used in research, clinical and e-learning environment. The new structure of the developed modules is based on the concept of lumped (0-D) numerical modelling. Different ECMO configurations have been connected to the cardiovascular network to reproduce Veno-Arterial (VA) and Veno-Venous (VV) ECMO assistance. The advantages and limitations of different ECMO cannulation strategies have been considered. We have used literature data to validate the effects of a combined ventilation and ECMO support strategy. RESULTS The results have shown that our simulations reproduced the typical effects induced during mechanical ventilation and ECMO assistance. We focused our attention on ECMO with triple cannulation such as Veno-Ventricular-Arterial (VV-A) and Veno-Atrial-Arterial (VA-A) configurations to improve the hemodynamic and energetic conditions of a virtual patient. Simulations of VV-A and VA-A assistance with and without mechanical ventilation have generated specific effects on cardiac output, coupling of arterial and ventricular elastance for both ventricles, mean pulmonary pressure, external work and pressure volume area. CONCLUSION The new modules of the systemic circulation and ECMO support allowed the study of the effects induced by concomitant mechanical ventilation and circulatory support. Based on our clinical experience during the COVID-19 pandemic, numerical simulations may help clinicians with data analysis and treatment optimisation of patients requiring both mechanical ventilation and circulatory support.","De Lazzari, Beatrice; Iacovoni, Attilio; Mottaghy, Khosrow; Capoccia, Massimo; Badagliacca, Roberto; Vizza, Carmine Dario; De Lazzari, Claudio",Computer methods and programs in biomedicine,231,1

Autophagy was inactivated with HPV to promote cancer progression. Here we explored the effects of crocin on cervical cancer cells, mainly on autophagy and apoptosis. Methods SiHa cells were treated with crocin, and proliferation, metastases, apoptosis and autophagy were measured using a CCK-8 assay, transwell migration assay, flow cytometry and immunofluorescence. Protein levels were measured using western blotting. The antitumor effects of crocin were validated in female BALB/c nude mice injected with SiHa cells. Results The result showed that 2, 4, 8 and 16 mM of crocin significantly reduced the viability of SiHa cells within 24 h. Subsequently, 0, 1, 2 and 4 mM crocin concentrations were used in later experiments. Treatment with crocin reduced invasive cells, while increasing autophagic and apoptotic cells dose-dependently. The enhanced apoptosis and autophagy were partly validated by an increase in cleaved caspase-3/caspase-3, cleaved caspase-9/caspase9, LC3B II/I, Beclin1 and ATG7. AMPK and mTOR were inactivated with crocin treatment, while PI3K was activated. These results indicated that crocin might promote autophagy and apoptosis by inactivating AMPK and mTOR signaling. Tumor progression was inhibited in mice treated with 50 mg/kg/d of crocin, which was demonstrated by smaller tumor volumes, less VEGF expression, more intense caspase-3 staining and increased LC3B II/I in the tumor tissues. Conclusions Crocin inhibited the progression of cervical cancer in vitro and in vivo, possibly through inactivation of AMPK and mTOR, inhibition of proliferation and invasion, and promotion of autophagy and apoptosis. These results support the potential therapeutic value of crocin in treating cervical cancer.","Zhang, Jian; Yang, Shaoping; Wang, Kana; Huang, Yu; Yang, Nian; Yang, Zhongmei; Zheng, Zhenrong; Wang, Yujue",Annals of translational medicine,231,1

This work also states an opinion shared by a lot of MIS colleagues in Asia. I am indeed fortunate to witness the transformation, revolution and disruption of surgery in gynecology in my lifetime. I think HIFU has allowed us to achieve the basic tenets of surgery, one of less pain, minimal complications, optimal destruction of a diseased organ, and optimal conservation of the human body. In this article, I will focus on HIFU treatment of uterine fibroids and adenomyosis. Uterine fibroids or myomas are common benign growths of the uterus and occurs in 20% to 50% of reproductive females. Adenomyosis involves endometrial lining cells that invade into the body of the uterus, like rust into the body of a car. Both uterine fibroids and adenomyosis can cause pain, heavy menstrual bleeding, and anemia. They can compress surrounding organs as they grow, leading to urinary, bowel, vascular and obstructive complications.

DESIGN Semi-structured interviews and site observations. Interviews were recorded, transcribed verbatim and imported to NVivo 12 for analysis. Inductive and deductive themes were identified, and elements of the RE-AIM framework and the social process framework were used when classifying these themes. SETTING Sixteen public high schools in San José, Costa Rica. PARTICIPANTS High school principal and kiosk concessionaires. RESULTS Products that did not adhere to the Guidelines were still widely available in schools, and amongst the most prevalent challenges to implementation that emerged from our interviews, were a lack of understanding of the policy content, a lack of monitoring and accountability, and competing values amongst actors which affected their views on the role that the school must have in offering a healthy food environment. CONCLUSION Most products offered in high schools did not meet the criteria required by the mandatory Guidelines, and several contextual factors were found to influence implementation. Strengthening the implementation of the Costa Rican Guidelines will require further actions at the governmental and school levels.","Jensen, Melissa L; Gonzalez, Wendy; Bolaños-Palmieri, Carolina; Monge-Rojas, Rafael; Frongillo, Edward A",Public health nutrition,231,5

Characterizing effective delivery methods of eHealth interventions is required to enable improved design and implementation of evidence-based health behavior change interventions. OBJECTIVE This study aims to systematically review the literature and synthesize evidence on the success of eHealth behavior change interventions in patients with cancer and survivors delivered by synchronous, asynchronous, or combined methods compared with a control group. Engagement with the intervention, behavior change, and health outcomes, including quality of life, fatigue, depression, and anxiety, were examined. METHODS A search of Scopus, Ovid MEDLINE, Excerpta Medica dataBASE, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature Plus, PsycINFO, Cochrane CENTRAL, and PubMed was conducted for studies published between March 2007 and March 2019. We looked for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) examining interventions delivered to adult cancer survivors via eHealth methods with a measure of health behavior change. Random-effects meta-analysis was performed to examine whether the method of eHealth delivery impacted the level of engagement, behavior change, and health outcomes. RESULTS A total of 24 RCTs were included predominantly examining dietary and physical activity behavior change interventions. There were 11 studies that used a synchronous approach and 11 studies that used an asynchronous approach, whereas 2 studies used a combined delivery method. Use of eHealth interventions improved exercise behavior (standardized mean difference [SMD] 0.34, 95% CI 0.21-0.48), diet behavior (SMD 0.44, 95% CI 0.18-0.70), fatigue (SMD 0.21, 95% CI -0.08 to 0.50; SMD change 0.22, 95% CI 0.09-0.35), anxiety (SMD 1.21, 95% CI: 0.36-2.07; SMD change 0.15, 95% CI -0.09 to 0.40), depression (SMD 0.15, 95% CI 0.00-0.30), and quality of life (SMD 0.12, 95% CI -0.10 to 0.34; SMD change 0.14, 95% CI 0.04-0.24). The mode of delivery did not influence the amount of dietary and physical activity behavior change observed. CONCLUSIONS Physical activity and dietary behavior change eHealth interventions delivered to patients with cancer or survivors have a small to moderate impact on behavior change and a small to very small benefit to quality of life, fatigue, depression, and anxiety. There is insufficient evidence to determine whether asynchronous or synchronous delivery modes yield superior results. Three-arm RCTs comparing delivery modes with a control with robust engagement reporting are required to determine the most successful delivery method for promoting behavior change and ultimately favorable health outcomes.","Furness, Kate; Sarkies, Mitchell N; Huggins, Catherine E; Croagh, Daniel; Haines, Terry P",Journal of medical Internet research,231,9

To examine the feasibility of analyzing GIST mutations using mRNA obtained with EUS-FNA, we prospectively enrolled 41 patients with subepithelial lesion from which EUS-FNA was successfully acquired tissue sample. Thirty-two, 5, and 4 subepithelial lesions were diagnosed as GISTs, schwannomas, and leiomyomas, respectively. After RNA was extracted from FNA sample, RNA was converted to cDNA. Full-length sequence of the KIT cDNA amplified via the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was successful in 31 (96.9%) out of 32 GIST and three out of 9 non-GIST (33.3%). The KIT mutation statuses of 31 GISTs in which KIT cDNA was amplified were successfully determined through directional sequencing. Furthermore, 15 of 16 surgically excised GISTs exhibited the same mutation status in both the EUS-FNA and resected samples. In vitro experiment, the minimum number of cells required to amplify full-length of KIT cDNA from RNA was one-tenth of that required to amplify KIT exon11 gene from DNA. This study clarifies that mutation analysis using RNA obtained with EUS-FNA is feasible and reliable. Moreover, our data would support that RNA-based mutation is superior to DNA-based mutation analysis in GIST.","Funasaka, Kohei; Miyahara, Ryoji; Furukawa, Kazuhiro; Sawada, Tsunaki; Maeda, Keiko; Yamamura, Takeshi; Ishikawa, Takuya; Ohno, Eizaburo; Nakamura, Masanao; Kawashima, Hiroki; Hirooka, Yoshiki; Ohmiya, Naoki; Fujishiro, Mitsuhiro",Translational oncology,231,1

DESIGN Thirty-two international experts, four methodologists, and four critical illness survivors met virtually at least monthly. All section groups gathered face-to-face at annual Society of Critical Care Medicine congresses; virtual connections included those unable to attend. A formal conflict of interest policy was developed a priori and enforced throughout the process. Teleconferences and electronic discussions among subgroups and whole panel were part of the guidelines' development. A general content review was completed face-to-face by all panel members in January 2017. METHODS Content experts, methodologists, and ICU survivors were represented in each of the five sections of the guidelines: Pain, Agitation/sedation, Delirium, Immobility (mobilization/rehabilitation), and Sleep (disruption). Each section created Population, Intervention, Comparison, and Outcome, and nonactionable, descriptive questions based on perceived clinical relevance. The guideline group then voted their ranking, and patients prioritized their importance. For each Population, Intervention, Comparison, and Outcome question, sections searched the best available evidence, determined its quality, and formulated recommendations as ""strong,"" ""conditional,"" or ""good"" practice statements based on Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation principles. In addition, evidence gaps and clinical caveats were explicitly identified. RESULTS The Pain, Agitation/Sedation, Delirium, Immobility (mobilization/rehabilitation), and Sleep (disruption) panel issued 37 recommendations (three strong and 34 conditional), two good practice statements, and 32 ungraded, nonactionable statements.

After going through different approaches covering k-space with radial, rosette, and concentric shell trajectories we have settled on a stack-of-spiral trajectory, which allows full brain coverage with (nominal) 3 mm isotropic resolution in 100 ms. The very high acceleration factor is facilitated by the near-isotropic k-space coverage, which allows high acceleration in all three spatial dimensions. METHODS The methodological section covers the basic sequence design as well as recent advances in image reconstruction including the targeted reconstruction, which allows real-time feedback applications, and-most recently-the time-domain principal component reconstruction (tPCR), which applies a principal component analysis of the acquired time domain data as a sparsifying transformation to improve reconstruction speed as well as quality. APPLICATIONS Although the BOLD-response is rather slow, the high speed acquisition of MREG allows separation of BOLD-effects from cardiac and breathing related pulsatility. The increased sensitivity enables direct detection of the dynamic variability of resting state networks as well as localization of single interictal events in epilepsy patients. A separate and highly intriguing application is aimed at the investigation of the glymphatic system by assessment of the spatiotemporal patterns of cardiac and breathing related pulsatility. DISCUSSION MREG has been developed to push the speed limits of fMRI.

DESIGN Scoping review. PARTICIPANTS A total of n=1852 athletes from various sport backgrounds and levels of competition. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES The primary measure used within the studies identified was the Athletic Identity Measurement Scale. Secondary outcome measures assessed demographic, psychosocial, behavioural, physical function and pain-related constructs. RESULTS Twenty-two studies were identified for inclusion. Samples were dominated by male, Caucasian athletes. The majority of studies captured musculoskeletal injuries, while only three studies included sport-related concussion. Athletic identity was significantly and positively associated with depressive symptom severity, sport performance traits (eg, ego-orientation and mastery-orientation), social network size, physical self-worth, motivation, rehabilitation overadherence, mental toughness and playing through pain, as well as injury severity and functional recovery outcomes. Findings pertaining to the association that an injury (as an exposure) had on athletic identity (as an outcome) were inconsistent and limited. CONCLUSIONS Athletic identity was most frequently associated with psychosocial, behavioural and injury-specific outcomes. Future research should seek to include diverse athlete samples (eg, women, athletes of different races, para-athletes) and should continue to reference theoretical injury models to inform study methodologies and to specify variables of interest for further exploration.","Renton, Tian; Petersen, Brian; Kennedy, Sidney",BMJ open,231,16

Using 2013-18 deidentified electronic health record data from US primary care practices, we found that provider teams outperformed solo providers, irrespective of team composition. Among solo providers, physicians and nonphysicians exhibited little meaningful difference in performance. As policy makers contemplate scope-of-practice changes, they should consider the effects of not only provider type but also team-based care on outcomes.

Biologic scaffolds (i.e., derived from naturally occurring materials) represent an alternative to synthetic surgical meshes and are less sensitive to infection. Among biologic scaffolds, extracellular matrix scaffolds promote stem/progenitor cell recruitment in models of tissue remodeling and, in the specific application of abdominal wall repair, have enough mechanical strength to support the repair. However, many concerns remain about the use of these scaffolds in the clinic due to their higher cost of production compared with synthetic meshes, despite having the same recurrence rate. The present review aims to highlight the pros and cons of using biologic scaffolds as surgical devices for abdominal wall repair and present possible improvements to widen their use in clinical practice.","Costa, Alessandra; Adamo, Sergio; Gossetti, Francesco; D'Amore, Linda; Ceci, Francesca; Negro, Paolo; Bruzzone, Paolo",Materials,231,17

In this prospective observational study, we investigated whether muscle strength or muscle mass are predictive of hospital length of stay (LOS) in patients with moderate to severe COVID-19 patients. METHODS We evaluated prospectively 196 patients at hospital admission for muscle mass and strength. Ten patients did not test positive for SARS-CoV-2 during hospitalization and were excluded from the analyses. RESULTS The sample comprised patients of both sexes (50% male) with a mean age (SD) of 59 (±15) years, body mass index of 29.5 (±6.9) kg/m2 . The prevalence of current smoking patients was 24.7%, and more prevalent coexisting conditions were hypertension (67.7%), obesity (40.9%), and type 2 diabetes (36.0%). Mean (SD) LOS was 8.6 days (7.7); 17.0% of the patients required intensive care; 3.8% used invasive mechanical ventilation; and 6.6% died during the hospitalization period. The crude hazard ratio (HR) for LOS was greatest for handgrip strength comparing the strongest versus other patients (1.47 [95% CI: 1.07-2.03; P = 0.019]). Evidence of an association between increased handgrip strength and shorter hospital stay was also identified when handgrip strength was standardized according to the sex-specific mean and standard deviation (1.23 [95% CI: 1.06-1.43; P = 0.007]). Mean LOS was shorter for the strongest patients (7.5 ± 6.1 days) versus others (9.2 ± 8.4 days). Evidence of associations were also present for vastus lateralis cross-sectional area. The crude HR identified shorter hospital stay for patients with greater sex-specific standardized values (1.20 [95% CI: 1.03-1.39; P = 0.016]). Evidence was also obtained associating longer hospital stays for patients with the lowest values for vastus lateralis cross-sectional area (0.63 [95% CI: 0.46-0.88; P = 0.006). Mean LOS for the patients with the lowest muscle cross-sectional area was longer (10.8 ± 8.8 days) versus others (7.7 ± 7.2 days). The magnitude of associations for handgrip strength and vastus lateralis cross-sectional area remained consistent and statistically significant after adjusting for other covariates. CONCLUSIONS Muscle strength and mass assessed upon hospital admission are predictors of LOS in patients with moderate to severe COVID-19, which stresses the value of muscle health in prognosis of this disease.","Gil, Saulo; Jacob Filho, Wilson; Shinjo, Samuel Katsuyuki; Ferriolli, Eduardo; Busse, Alexandre Leopold; Avelino-Silva, Thiago Junqueira; Longobardi, Igor; de Oliveira Júnior, Gersiel Nascimento; Swinton, Paul; Gualano, Bruno; Roschel, Hamilton","Journal of cachexia, sarcopenia and muscle",231,6

Participants recognized the importance of EIDM and the significance of integrating explicit and tacit evidence in the EIDM process, which was enhanced by CoP. Tacit knowledge, particularly from peers and personal experience, was the preferred source of knowledge, with informal peer interactions being the favored form of CoP to support EIDM.

METHODS Our surgical intensive care unit (SICU) admissions receive MRSA nares cultures and if positive are isolated followed by eradication treatment. This strategy was retrospectively reviewed. RESULTS Our nares-positive culture rate was 21% (30/145), and the sputum positive (sputum+) rate was 18% (26/145). Positive nares culture (Nares+) was eradicated in 63%. The rate of sputum+ in Nares+ patients was 36% (9/25). The rate of sputum+ in Nares- was 10% (12/115; P = .003). The sputum+ SICU length of stay (LOS) (18 ± 12 days in 23 S+ patients) is longer than in sputum- (10 ± 9 days in 69 S-patients, P = .0002). CONCLUSIONS This SICU has high rates of both nares and sputum MRSA cultures.

We describe the spectrum of clinicopathologic lesions in the skin that can be the only symptom or the first manifestation of COVID-19 and demonstrate the origin of the virus. We collected 25 patients with skin lesions in this context. We recognized 5 types of cutaneous manifestations including acute acroischemic or chilblain-like lesions (11), purpura palpable (2), exanthemas (9), urticarial eruptions (1), and other lesions (2) that might appear with more unspecific pictures. Chilblain-like lesions were the most common form of presentation, which tend to appear as self-healing, erythematous-necrotic plaques mostly on the feet, in young patients with no systemic symptoms associated. Importantly, we visualized viral particles with electron microscopy in 5 of 13 cases analyzed.

OC43 apparently emerged from a bovine coronavirus (BCoV) spillover. All three viruses attach to 9-O-acetylated sialoglycans via spike protein S with hemagglutinin-esterase (HE) acting as a receptor-destroying enzyme. In BCoV, an HE lectin domain promotes esterase activity toward clustered substrates. OC43 and HKU1, however, lost HE lectin function as an adaptation to humans. Replaying OC43 evolution, we knocked out BCoV HE lectin function and performed forced evolution-population dynamics analysis. Loss of HE receptor binding selected for second-site mutations in S, decreasing S binding affinity by orders of magnitude. Irreversible HE mutations led to cooperativity in virus swarms with low-affinity S minority variants sustaining propagation of high-affinity majority phenotypes. Salvageable HE mutations induced successive second-site substitutions in both S and HE. Apparently, S and HE are functionally interdependent and coevolve to optimize the balance between attachment and release. This mechanism of glycan-based receptor usage, entailing a concerted, fine-tuned activity of two envelope protein species, is unique among CoVs, but reminiscent of that of influenza A viruses. Apparently, general principles fundamental to virion-sialoglycan interactions prompted convergent evolution of two important groups of human and animal pathogens.","Lang, Yifei; Li, Wentao; Li, Zeshi; Koerhuis, Danielle; van den Burg, Arthur C S; Rozemuller, Erik; Bosch, Berend-Jan; van Kuppeveld, Frank J M; Boons, Geert-Jan; Huizinga, Eric G; van der Schaar, Hilde M; de Groot, Raoul J",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,231,1

We assessed outcomes from 2 recent large prospective studies to determine the association among TICI, age, and outcome. MATERIALS AND METHODS Data from the Solitaire FR Thrombectomy for Acute Revascularization (STAR) trial, an international multicenter prospective single-arm thrombectomy study and the Solitaire arm of the Solitaire FR With the Intention For Thrombectomy (SWIFT) trial were pooled. TICI was determined by core laboratory review. Good outcome was defined as an mRS score of 0-2 at 90 days. We analyzed the association among clinical outcome, successful-versus-unsuccessful reperfusion (TICI 2b-3 versus TICI 0-2a), and age (dichotomized across the median). RESULTS Two hundred sixty-nine of 291 patients treated with Solitaire in the STAR and SWIFT data bases for whom TICI and 90-day outcome data were available were included. The median age was 70 years (interquartile range, 60-76 years) with an age range of 25-88 years. The mean age of patients 70 years of age or younger was 59 years, and it was 77 years for patients older than 70 years. There was no significant difference between baseline NIHSS scores or procedure time metrics. Hemorrhage and device-related complications were more common in the younger age group but did not reach statistical significance. In absolute terms, the rate of good outcome was higher in the younger population (64% versus 44%, P < .001). However, the magnitude of benefit from successful reperfusion was higher in the 70 years of age and older group (OR, 4.82; 95% CI, 1.32-17.63 versus OR 7.32; 95% CI, 1.73-30.99). CONCLUSIONS Successful reperfusion is the strongest predictor of good outcome following mechanical thrombectomy, and the magnitude of benefit is highest in the patient population older than 70 years of age.","Slater, L A; Coutinho, J M; Gralla, J; Nogueira, R G; Bonafé, A; Dávalos, A; Jahan, R; Levy, E; Baxter, B J; Saver, J L; Pereira, V M",AJNR.

Whole-body vibration (WBV) could potentially attenuate the issue of muscle atrophy; however, there exists no device that could potentially provide WBV in supine position that is suitable for critically ill patients. Hence, the purpose of this study was to develop a new wearable suit, called therapeutic vibration device (TVD), that can provide WBV in supine position and test its effects on physiologic markers of physical activity including muscle activation, oxygen consumption (VO2), and regional hemoglobin oxygen saturation (rSO2). The prototype TVD delivered multi-frequency WBV axially to 19 healthy participants in supine position for 10 minutes simultaneously at 25 Hz/4.2 grms on the feet and 15 Hz/0.7 grms on the shoulders. Muscle activation was recorded by electromyography (EMG), VO2 was measured by indirect calorimetry and rSO2 was recorded by near-infrared spectroscopy. Recordings were collected from each participant from multiple body locations, on three separate days, at baseline and during the intervention. Acceleration was also recorded to gain insight into transmissibility and coherence. Repeated-measures ANOVA using Bonferroni correction revealed that the muscle activity significantly increased by 4% - 62% (p < 0.05), VO2 improved by 22.3% (p < 0.05) and rSO2 increased by 1.4% - 4.5% (p < 0.05) compared to baseline. WBV provided by the TVD is capable of producing physiologic responses consistent with mild physical activity. Such effects could potentially be valuable as an adjunct to physical therapy for early mobilization to prevent atrophy occurring from prolonged immobilization.","Saxena, Himanshu; Ward, Kevin R; Krishnan, Chandramouli; Epureanu, Bogdan I","IEEE access : practical innovations, open solutions",231,16

In the Canton of Zurich, Switzerland, young adults in the nightlife setting were recently set as a priority group for preventive interventions. METHOD Based on the predefined protocol, we systematically collated evidence on preventive interventions regarding young adults' use of alcohol and illicit drugs in nightlife. EBSCO Medline, Embase, PsycInfo, and PsyIndex were searched for reviews (1990-2016) and primary studies (2012-2016). Additional sources and experts were consulted, and stakeholders involved throughout the research process. Interventions were summarized according to the before-, at- and after-the-party stages. RESULTS Before the party, good-quality studies were found for social media interventions, indicating positive effects on alcohol consumption. For the at-the-party stage, good evidence of low to medium quality was presented for crisis interventions and medical care at festivals and for multi-sector approaches. The after-the-party setting was mainly covered by gray literature, and evidence remained limited for designated drivers and street safety interventions in the target group. The stakeholder dialogue was a structured exchange and favored the following evidence-informed preventive intervention fields: personalized feedback via social media, sustaining awareness among nightlife managers, focus on public nighttime transportation, and multi-sector approaches. CONCLUSION The systematic involvement of stakeholders was an inspiring means for identifying evidence relevant for practice and policy in nightlife and fostering implementation. Especially, individual-based interventions, such as personalized feedback via social media and guided reflection on alcohol or drug use, and broader networking, were considered promising.","Brunn, Judith; Brunner, Sibylle; Mütsch, Margot",European addiction research,231,16

The patient tolerated the transition well with stable symptoms, 6-minute walk distance, and pulmonary hemodynamics. Additional studies are needed to better define the comparative efficacy and safety of inhaled iloprost and selexipag.","Verlinden, Nathan J; Walter, Claire; Raina, Amresh; Benza, Raymond L",Journal of pharmacy practice,231,5

These are medical biology procedures that are currently reserved for biologists. Nevertheless, their use is now being reinforced by the Covid-19 pandemic. What role should the dispensing pharmacist have in relation to the patient? What role can the biologist have in this system? METHODS A survey was carried out in pharmacies in the Auvergne Rhône-Alpes region, as well as in Cameroon during the summer of 2020, to evaluate the use of RDT and self-tests. The answers obtained to the 10 questions were discussed after a simple statistical analysis. RESULTS 283 pharmacies and 13 Cameroonian pharmacies participated in our survey. Pharmacists want to develop the use of RDT and self-test, but agree that training is necessary. Some tests are dispensed despite their unproven clinical usefulness. CONCLUSIONS The delivery of TRODs and self-tests is acquired in pharmacies despite the reluctance of biologists. Pharmacists should be trained by biologists to use these tests in a relevant and appropriate manner.","Boulliat, Caroline; Bilong, Catherine Véronique; Dussart, Claude; Massoubre, Bernard",Annales pharmaceutiques francaises,231,1

However, it is still a challenge to develop multifunctional bioapplications with minimal invasiveness, biocompatibility, and stable electrical performance under various mechanical deformations of biological tissues. In this study, a natural silk protein with carbon nanotubes (CNTs) is utilized to realize an epidermal electronic tattoo (E-tattoo) system for multifunctional applications that address these challenging issues through dispersing highly conductive CNTs onto the biocompatible silk nanofibrous networks with porous nature to construct skin-adhesive ultrathin electronic patches. Individual components that incorporate electrically and optically active heaters, a temperature sensor (temperature coefficient of resistance of 5.2 × 10-3 °C-1 ), a stimulator for drug delivery (>500 µm penetration depth in skin), and real-time electrophysiological signal detectors are described. This strategy of E-tattoos integrated onto human skin can open a new route to a next-generation electronic platform for wearable and epidermal bioapplications.","Gogurla, Narendar; Kim, Yisub; Cho, Suyoung; Kim, Jangsun; Kim, Sunghwan",Advanced materials,231,19

However, the mechanism of myocardial injury in COVID-19 remains unclear. In this retrospective study, we compared the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 patients with different troponin I (TnI) levels during hospitalization to provide a clinical reference for the identification of those at high-risk. Methods In total, 218 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 in Yichang Central People's Hospital and Yichang Third People's Hospital between January 23 and February 19, 2020 were initially included. Of these patients, 89 underwent TnI testing during hospitalization and were finally included in the study. The medical history, clinical signs and symptoms at the time of admission, and laboratory test results were recorded. The patients were assigned to the normal TnI group (TnI <0.01 µg/L; n=67) or the elevated TnI group (TnI >0.01 µg/L; n=22). Results The incidence of elevated TnI in our patient cohort was 24.7%. There were significant differences between the two groups in the following factors: history of coronary heart disease (CHD), age, lymphocyte count, prothrombin time (PT), activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), and levels of interleukin (IL)-6, C-reactive protein (CRP), myoglobin (MYO), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and albumin (all P<0.05). Binary logistic analysis showed that a history of CHD, age, lymphocyte count, IL-6, APTT, and MYO were influencing factors of elevated serum TnI. Conclusions A history of CHD, advanced age, decreased lymphocyte count, increased IL-6, increased MYO, and prolonged APTT were independent influencing factors of elevated TnI in COVID-19 patients. COVID-19 patients with these characteristics are prone to myocardial injury.","Fan, Zhi-Xing; Yang, Jun; Zhang, Jing; He, Chao; Wu, Hui; Yang, Chao-Jun; Zheng, Tao; Ma, Cong; Xiang, Zu-Jin; Zhai, Yu-Hong; Jiang, Jing; Qiu, Shao-Qin; Yang, Jian",Cardiovascular diagnosis and therapy,231,31

In this study, we investigated the application of ENB biopsy combined with Massage staining in the diagnosis and treatment of peripheral pulmonary lesions (PPL). METHODS The clinical data of 15 PPL patients undergoing ENB biopsy plus Massage staining between August 2017 and January 2018 were retrospectively reviewed. Among them, there were 12 male and 3 female, and the mean age was (51.3±2.1) years old. RESULTS The diameter of PPLs ranged from 6 mm to 36 mm (mean: 14.0 mm). The successful biopsy rate was 66.7%. All patients successfully underwent Massage staining. The distance between the centers of staining and lesion was (1.0±0.4) cm, and the diameter of staining was (2.8±0.6) cm. The mean operation time was (26.7±5.3 ) min, and the mean blood loss during surgery was (3.3±1.5) mL. There was no pneumothorax, hemothorax and pulmonary vascular injury during the procedure.

Despite the great number of steerable joint designs, currently available steerable tips tend to be vulnerable to external loading, thus featuring low bending stiffness. This work aims to provide empirical evidence that the bending stiffness can be considerably increased by using fully actuated joint constructions, enabling left/right and up/down tip rotations with the minimum of two degrees of freedom (DOF), rather than conventional underactuated constructions enabling these rotations with more than two DOF. MATERIAL AND METHODS A steerable MIS instrument prototype with a fully actuated joint construction was compared to state-of-the-art underactuated steerable instruments in a number of tip deflection experiments. The tip deflections due to loading were measured by means of a universal testing machine in four bending scenarios: straight and bent over 20°, 40° and 60°. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS The experimental results support the claim that a fully actuated joint construction exhibits a significantly larger bending stiffness than an underactuated joint construction. Furthermore, it was shown that the underactuated instrument tips show a considerable difference between their neutral positions before and after loading, which could also be greatly minimised by full actuation.","Jelínek, Filip; Gerboni, Giada; Henselmans, Paul W J; Pessers, Rob; Breedveld, Paul",Minimally invasive therapy & allied technologies : MITAT : official journal of the Society for Minimally Invasive Therapy,231,7

The NOTES for left colectomy offers patients reduced pain and easier recovery. Limited data are available for trNS, which is considered safe for various indications. However, the technique is not standardized, and patients in the reported series are highly selected. STUDY DESIGN Patients scheduled for trNS were entered into a prospective registry on an intention-to-treat basis. The primary endpoint was trNS feasibility, and secondary endpoints were morbidity, pain, length of stay, and inflammatory response. A medial-to-lateral dissection with full mobilization of the splenic flexure and total intracorporeal anastomosis was performed. The rectum was covered with a wound protector for transrectal extraction. RESULTS Of 95 elective sigmoidectomies, 81% (n = 77) were enrolled for either transvaginal NOTES resection (n = 37) or trNS (n = 40). There was no difference in body mass index or indication between patients undergoing laparoscopic-assisted sigmoidectomy (LAS), transvaginal resection, or trNS, although trNS patients were younger. Mainly because of a mismatch of bulky specimen and narrow pelvis, 17.5% of trNS were converted to LAS. Major morbidity was 10%, including 2 septic complications. During the study, the anastomosis technique was changed from double stapled end-to-end to side-to-end anastomosis. CONCLUSIONS Transrectal rigid hybrid natural orifice translumenal endoscopic sigmoidectomy is feasible and safe in a high proportion of unselected consecutive patients with diverticular disease undergoing elective treatment. Intracorporeal side-to-end anastomosis is the preferred technique, and trNS should be offered for elective sigmoidectomy presupposing advanced laparoscopic experience.","Lamm, Sebastian H; Zerz, Andreas; Efeoglou, Anastasios; Steinemann, Daniel C",Journal of the American College of Surgeons,231,5

The World Health Organization (WHO) has published different recommendations in this regard. World-wide, many health services have improved their surge capacity with the implementation of new temporal hospital structures, but there have been few experiences of use over time despite representing an important element as support to the hospital network in the management of COVID-19 patients. In this article, the experiences are explained in the design, execution, and use of the temporal COVID-19 Hospital H144 of the Health Service of the Principality of Asturias (Sespa), with 144 beds, which was in operation from April 1 through July 1, 2020 (without admitting patients) and from November 12, 2020 through March 5, 2121, admitting a total of 334 COVID-19 patients (66% women; 34% men) and generating 3,149 hospital stays. Maximum occupancy was 74 patients. Mean stay was 9.42 days (MD = 3.99; [1-34]). At discharge, 126 patients (38%) went to a nursing home, 112 (33%) to their home, 40 (12%) were transferred to another hospital, and 56 (17%) died.

The control of most AMDV outbreaks is complex due to the difficulties of establishing the source of infection based only on the available on-farm epidemiological data. In this sense, phylogenetic analysis of the strains present in a farm may help elucidate the origin of the infection and improve the control and biosecurity measures. OBJECTIVES This study had the following aims: characterize the AMDV strains from most outbreaks produced at Spanish farms between 2012-2019 at the molecular level, and assess the utility of the combined use of molecular and epidemiological data to track the possible routes of infection. METHODS Thirty-seven strains from 17 farms were partially sequenced for the NS1 and VP2 genes and analyzed phylogenetically with other strains described worldwide. RESULTS Spanish AMDV strains are clustered in four major clades that generally show a good geographical correlation, confirming that most had been established in Spain a long time ago. The combined study of phylogenetic results and epidemiological information of each farm suggests that most of the AMDV outbreaks since 2012 had been produced by within-farm reservoirs, while a few of them may have been due to the introduction of the virus through international trade. CONCLUSIONS The combination of phylogenetic inference, together with epidemiological data, helps assess the possible origin of AMDV infections in mink farms and improving the control and prevention of this disease.","Prieto, Alberto; Fernández-Antonio, Ricardo; López-Lorenzo, Gonzalo; Díaz-Cao, José Manuel; López-Novo, Cynthia; Remesar, Susana; Panadero, Rosario; Díaz, Pablo; Morrondo, Patrocinio; Díez-Baños, Pablo; Fernández, Gonzalo",Journal of veterinary science,231,19

Yet, other studies have been unable to detect SARS-CoV-2 RNA in skin biopsies of ""COVID toes"" by reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction testing. OBJECTIVE In order to address these apparently conflicting findings, we compared detection of SARS-CoV-2 SP, through RNA in situ hybridization (ISH) vs immunohistochemistry (IHC), in skin biopsies of acral perniotic lesions presenting during the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS Three of six cases showed positive immunohistochemical labeling of endothelial cells, with 1 of 3 cases with sufficient depth also having labeling of eccrine glands, using an anti-SP SARS-CoV-2 antibody. These three cases positive with IHC were negative for SP by RNA ISH. CONCLUSION While the gold standard for detection of SARS-CoV-2 in tissue sections has yet to be determined, the detection of SARS-CoV-2 SP alone without spike RNA suggests cleaved SP may be present in cutaneous endothelial cells and eccrine epithelium, providing a potential pathogenetic mechanism of COVID-19 endotheliitis.

This new law replaced the previous line item budgeting, with a new program-based budgeting (PBB) process. This study examined the experience of health sector PBB implementation at the county level in Kenya. METHODS We carried out a systematic review of the literature documenting the health sector application and utility of PBB in low- and middle-income countries. We then collected empirical data to examine the experience of health sector application of PBB at County Level in Kenya. RESULTS In the financial year 2017/18, counties utilised the PBB approach for health sector planning. The PBB approach was perceived by keys stakeholders; to have improved the alignment of technical priorities with budgetary allocation, and to have increased transparency, accountability and openness of the process. Its challenges included lack of clear tools and guidelines to support implementation, low capacity at county level, political interference and the organisation of the public sector electronic financial management system around line item budgeting system. CONCLUSION PBB is potentially a useful tool for aligning health sector planning and budgeting and ensuring the Annual Work Plan is more result oriented. However, realisation of this goal would be enhanced by the developing clear tools and guidelines to support its implementation, building capacity for county health sector managers to better understand the PBB application, and reforming the public-sector budgetary management system to align it with the PBB approach.","Tsofa, Benjamin; Musotsi, Protus; Kagwanja, Nancy; Waithaka, Dennis; Molyneux, Sassy; Barasa, Edwine; Maina, Thomas; Chuma, Jane",The International journal of health planning and management,231,24

The proposed biofuel cell works by an enzymatic reaction with glucose in sweat absorbed by the specially designed textile for sustainable and efficient energy harvesting. The output power of the textile-based biofuel cell has been optimized by changing electrode size and stacking electrodes and corresponding fluidic channels suitable for following power management circuit. The output power level of single electrode is estimated less than 0.5 μW and thus a two-staged power management circuit using intermediate supercapacitor has been presented. As a solution to produce a higher power level, multiple stacks of biofuel cell electrodes have been proposed and thus the textile-based biofuel cell employing serially connected 5 stacks produces a maximal power of 13 μW with an output voltage of 0.88 V when load resistance is 40 kΩ. A buck-boost converter employing a crystal oscillator directly triggered by DC output voltage of the biofuel cell makes it possible to obtain output voltage of the DC-DC converter is 6.75 V. The efficiency of the DC-DC converter is estimated as approximately 50% when the output power of the biofuel cell is tens microwatts. In addition, LT-spice modeling and simulation has been presented to estimate power consumption of each element of the proposed DC-DC converter circuit and the predicted output voltage has good agreement with measurement result.","Seok, Seonho; Wang, Cong; Lefeuvre, Elie; Park, Jungyul",Sensors,231,24

However, conventional laparoscopic hernia repair (CL) usually requires three working ports ranging from 5 to 10 mm, and each increasing port is associated with possible increasing morbidity and pain related to ports. This has led to the development of single incision laparoscopic hernia repair (SIL) which can further reduce the port-related morbidities and improve cosmetic outcomes. The aim of the study was to evaluate the safety and feasibility of SIL using both transabdominal preperitoneal (TAPP) and totally preperitoneal (TEP) approaches and compare the patients' wound satisfaction between the two groups. METHODS This is a retrospective review of prospectively collected data. We analyzed the results of patients who underwent either CL or SIL for inguinal hernia between January 2011 and July 2012 in Pamela Youde Nethersole Eastern Hospital. Patients' demographic details, type of hernia, operative time, mesh used, and post-operative complications were compared. A telephone survey was also conducted to evaluate patients' subjective wound satisfaction. RESULTS In total, 32 SIL and 35 CL procedures were performed in this period. The two groups were matched for age, sex, type of hernia and ASA grading. The mean operative time was significantly shorter in the CL group (52.6 vs. 62.6 min, p = 0.02). All SIL procedures were completed successfully without conversion to CL or open repair and post-operative complications such as wound infection, seroma, recurrence and chronic pain were also comparable between the two groups. As for the telephone survey, SIL groups' wound is less obvious and less detectable by others as compared to CL, but on the whole both groups of patients are very satisfied with the wound outcomes. All the SIL groups would continue with their decision on SIL and 60 % of CL group would choose SIL if they had to go back in time. CONCLUSION Our results have shown that in experienced hands, SIL is feasible and as safe as CL. Further randomized trials should be performed to evaluate the clinical application of single incision TEP and TAPP.","Yang, G P C; Tung, K L M",Hernia : the journal of hernias and abdominal wall surgery,231,17

OBJECTIVES To assess published data on the development of biopsy-site primary cutaneous melanoma among biopsy-proven HDN managed with either re-excision or observation. METHODS A systematic review of all published data: a total of 5293 records were screened, 18 articles were assessed in full text and 12 studies met inclusion criteria. No controlled trials were identified. RESULTS Most studies (11 of 12, 92%) were retrospective chart reviews, and one was both a cross-sectional and cohort study. Many studies (nine of 12, 75%) had no head-to-head comparison groups and either only reported HDN that were re-excised or observed. A total of 2673 (1535 observed vs. 1138 re-excised) HDN of various grades were included. Follow-up varied between 2 weeks and 30 years. Nine studies reported that no melanomas developed. Eleven biopsy-site melanomas developed across three of the studies, six among observed lesions (0·39%) and five among re-excised lesions (0·44%). CONCLUSIONS Based upon the available evidence the rates of biopsy-site primary melanoma were similarly low among observed lesions and re-excised lesions. This suggests that HDNs can be observed with minimal adverse melanoma-associated outcomes. However, all included articles were of low quality and further prospective trials could better guide clinical decision making.","Vuong, K T; Walker, J; Powell, H B; Thomas, N E; Jonas, D E; Adamson, A S",The British journal of dermatology,231,5

Recent systematic estimates of the worldwide burden of GBS suggested that there are 319,000 cases of infant iGBS disease each year, and an estimated 147,000 stillbirths and young-infant deaths, with the highest burden occurring in Sub-Saharan Africa. The following priority data gaps were highlighted: (1) long-term outcome data after infant iGBS, including mild disability, to calculate quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) or disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) and (2) economic burden for iGBS survivors and their families. Geographic data gaps were also noted with few studies from low- and middle- income countries (LMIC), where the GBS burden is estimated to be the highest. In this paper we present the protocol for a multi-country matched cohort study designed to estimate the risk of long-term neurodevelopmental impairment (NDI), socioemotional behaviors, and economic outcomes for children who survive invasive GBS disease in Argentina, India, Kenya, Mozambique, and South Africa. Children will be identified from health demographic surveillance systems, hospital records, and among participants of previous epidemiological studies. The children will be aged between 18 months to 17 years. A tablet-based custom-designed application will be used to capture data from direct assessment of the child and interviews with the main caregiver. In addition, a parallel sub-study will prospectively measure the acute costs of hospitalization due to neonatal sepsis or meningitis, irrespective of underlying etiology. In summary, these data are necessary to characterize the consequences of iGBS disease and enable the advancement of effective strategies for survivors to reach their developmental and economic potential. In particular, our study will inform the development of a full public health value proposition on maternal GBS immunization that is being coordinated by the World Health Organization.","Paul, Proma; Procter, Simon R; Dangor, Ziyaad; Bassat, Quique; Abubakar, Amina; Santhanam, Sridhar; Libster, Romina; Gonçalves, Bronner P; Madhi, Shabir A; Bardají, Azucena; Mwangome, Eva; Mabrouk, Adam; John, Hima B; Sánchez Yanotti, Clara; Chandna, Jaya; Sithole, Pamela; Mucasse, Humberto; Katana, Patrick V; Koukounari, Artemis; Harden, Lois M; Aerts, Celine; Ghoor, Azra; Leahy, Shannon; Mbatha, Sibongile; Lowick, Sarah; Lala, Sanjay G; Bramugy, Justina; Newton, Charles; Hossain, A K M Tanvir; Sadeq-Ur Rahman, Qazi; Lambach, Philipp; Jit, Mark; Lawn, Joy E",Gates open research,231,16

Diaphragmatic electrical activity (Eadi) recorded using specialized nasogastric tubes is a surrogate of respiratory brain stem output. This study aimed at testing whether adapting ventilator settings during PSV using a protocolized Eadi-based optimization strategy, or Eadi-triggered and -cycled assisted pressure ventilation (or PSVN) could (1) improve patient-ventilator interaction and (2) reduce or normalize patient respiratory effort as estimated by the work of breathing (WOB) and the pressure time product (PTP). METHODS This was a prospective cross-over study. Patients with a known chronic pulmonary obstructive or restrictive disease, asynchronies or suspected intrinsic positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) who were ventilated using PSV were enrolled in the study. Four different ventilator settings were sequentially applied for 15 minutes (step 1: baseline PSV as set by the clinician, step 2: Eadi-optimized PSV to adjust PS level, inspiratory trigger, and cycling settings, step 3: step 2 + PEEP adjustment, step 4: PSVN). The same settings as step 3 were applied again after step 4 to rule out a potential effect of time. Breathing pattern, trigger delay (Td), inspiratory time in excess (Tiex), pressure-time product (PTP), and work of breathing (WOB) were measured at the end of each step. RESULTS Eleven patients were enrolled in the study. Eadi-optimized PSV reduced Td without altering Tiex in comparison with baseline PSV. PSVN reduced Td and Tiex in comparison with baseline and Eadi-optimized PSV. Respiratory pattern did not change during the four steps. The improvement in patient-ventilator interaction did not lead to changes in WOB or PTP. CONCLUSIONS Eadi-optimized PSV allows improving patient ventilator interaction but does not alter patient effort in patients with mild asynchrony.

COMMENT COVID-19 patients are more susceptible to thromboembolic events, including disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). Various studies have emphasized the role of neutrophil elastase (NE) in the development of DIC in patients with ARDS and sepsis. It has been shown that NE inhibition by sivelestat mitigates ALI through amelioration of injuries in alveolar epithelium and vascular endothelium, as well as reversing the neutrophil-mediated increased vascular permeability. WHAT IS NEW AND CONCLUSIONS Sivelestat, a selective NE inhibitor, has not been evaluated for its possible therapeutic effects against SARS-CoV-2 infection. Based on its promising beneficial effects in underlying complications of COVID-19, sivelestat could be considered as a promising modality for better management of COVID-19-induced ALI/ARDS or coagulopathy.","Sahebnasagh, Adeleh; Saghafi, Fatemeh; Safdari, Mohammadreza; Khataminia, Masoud; Sadremomtaz, Afsaneh; Talaei, Zeinab; Rezai Ghaleno, Hassan; Bagheri, Mahdi; Habtemariam, Solomon; Avan, Razieh",Journal of clinical pharmacy and therapeutics,231,16

We compared the tissue responses of coronary arteries after the implantation of third-generation abluminal biodegradable-polymer everolimus-eluting stent (3rd EES) and second-generation durable-polymer EES (2nd EES) using autopsy specimens and an atherosclerotic porcine model. We compared the histology of stented coronary arteries obtained by autopsy performed 1-10 months after 3rd EES (n (number of cases) = 4, stent-implanted period of 3-7 months) and 2nd EES (n (number of cases) = 9, stent-implanted period of 1-10 months) implantations. The ratio of covered stent struts was higher with 3rd EESs than with 2nd EESs (3rd; 0.824 ± 0.032 vs. 2nd; 0.736 ± 0.022, p = 0.035). Low-density lipoprotein receptor knockout minipigs were stented with 3rd or 2nd EES in the coronary arteries and the stented regions were investigated. The fibrin deposition around the 2nd EES was more prominent. Additionally, higher density of smooth muscle cells was confirmed after the 3rd EES implantation. Pathological examination after the 3rd EES demonstrated a combination of less fibrin deposition and more rapid acquisition of well-developed neointima as compared to the 2nd EES at autopsy and the atherosclerotic porcine model.","Migita, Suguru; Kitano, Daisuke; Li, Yuxin; Koyama, Yutaka; Shimodai-Yamada, Sayaka; Onishi, Akira; Fuchimoto, Daiichiro; Suzuki, Shunichi; Nakamura, Yoshiyuki; Matsuyama, Taka-Aki; Hirota, Seiichi; Sakuma, Masashi; Tsujimoto, Masahiko; Hirayama, Atsushi; Okumura, Yasuo; Hao, Hiroyuki",Scientific reports,231,16

Here, we show that this three-step modification pathway exists in Dictyostelium discoideum, model of the evolutionary superfamily Amoebozoa. Not only are previously established modifications observable by mass spectrometry in strains with the most conserved genes of each step deleted, but also additional modifications are detected, indicating a certain plasticity of the pathway in the amoeba. Unlike described for yeast, D. discoideum allows for an unconditional deletion of the single tQCUG gene, as long as the Elongator-dependent modification pathway is intact. In gene deletion strains of the modification pathway, protein amounts are significantly reduced as shown by flow cytometry and Western blotting, using strains expressing different glutamine leader constructs fused to GFP. Most dramatic are these effects, when the tQCUG gene is deleted, or Elp3, the catalytic component of the Elongator complex is missing. In addition, Elp3 is the most strongly conserved protein of the modification pathway, as our phylogenetic analysis reveals. The implications of this observation are discussed with respect to the evolutionary age of the components acting in the Elongator-dependent modification pathway.","Schäck, Manfred A; Jablonski, Kim Philipp; Gräf, Stefan; Klassen, Roland; Schaffrath, Raffael; Kellner, Stefanie; Hammann, Christian",Nucleic acids research,231,28

Despite the prevalence, morbidities, and associated financial burden, treatment options have not changed since the introduction of injectable insulin. To date, over 40,000 pancreas transplants have been performed globally. It remains the only known method for restoring glycemic control and thus curing type 1 diabetes mellitus. The aim of this review is to bring pancreatic transplantation out of the specialist realm, informing practitioners about this important procedure, so that they feel better equipped to refer suitable patients for transplantation and manage, counsel, and support when encountering them within their own specialty. This study was a narrative review conducted in October 2015, with OVID interface searching EMBASE and MEDLINE databases, using Timeframe: Inception to October 2015. Articles were assessed for clinical relevance and most up-to-date content, with articles written in English as the only inclusion criterion. Other sources used included conference proceedings/presentations and unpublished data from our institution (Oxford Transplant Centre). Pancreatic transplantation is growing and has quickly become the gold standard of care for patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus and renal failure. Significant improvements in quality of life and life expectancy make pancreatic transplant a viable and economically feasible intervention. It remains the most effective method of establishing and maintaining euglycemia, halting and potentially reversing complications associated with diabetes.","Dholakia, Shamik; Mittal, Shruti; Quiroga, Isabel; Gilbert, James; Sharples, Edward J; Ploeg, Rutger J; Friend, Peter J",The American journal of medicine,231,1

Many retrospective studies have reported that robotic gastrectomy is safe and feasible, with similar short- and long-term outcomes as laparoscopic gastrectomy. However, no studies have reported the details of surgical and survival outcomes for robotic gastrectomy. This study aimed to evaluate the surgical trends and techniques of robotic gastrectomy and analyze the surgical outcomes of 2000 consecutive patients with gastric cancer who underwent robotic gastrectomy over 14 years. METHODS Between July 2005 and January 2019, 2000 consecutive robotic gastrectomies were performed. We evaluated short- and long-term outcomes as well as surgical trends after robotic gastrectomy. RESULTS There were 1,560 subtotal gastrectomies (78%), 324 total gastrectomies (16.2%), 83 proximal gastrectomies (4.2%), and 33 completion total gastrectomies (1.7%). The rates of major complications and mortality were 3.1% and 0.3%, respectively. In a subgroup analysis, there were no significant differences in the rate of complications over time (P = 0.696). Five-year overall survival rates were 97.6% for stage I, 91.9% for stage II, and 69.2% for stage III, with a total recurrence rate of 5.3%. Since its adoption in 2005, the proportion of robotic gastrectomies, as well as technically demanding procedures have increased over time. CONCLUSIONS Our 14 years' experience of 2000 robotic gastrectomies has shown the proportion, as well as the number of robotic gastrectomies, have tended to increase and trends toward to technically demanding procedures. Outcomes of robotic gastrectomy appear safe and feasible with acceptable short- and long-term outcomes.","Choi, Seohee; Song, Jeong Ho; Lee, Sejin; Cho, Minah; Kim, Yoo Min; Kim, Hyoung-Il; Hyung, Woo Jin",Gastric cancer : official journal of the International Gastric Cancer Association and the Japanese Gastric Cancer Association,231,19

Material and methods In this study, the radiological and laboratory findings obtained from 31 consecutive patients who underwent MWA were retrospectively evaluated. The survival periods and complication rates were analysed. Results Microwave ablation was applied to 42 hepatocellular carcinoma nodules in 31 patients. The mean age of the patients was 61 ± 7.3 (median 62, range 46-78) years. The mean overall survival (OS) was 47.4 ± 3.3 months. The rates of cumulative OS in the first, second, and third years were 95.2%, 91.8%, and 79.2%, respectively. The mean disease-free survival (DFS) rate was 24.1 ± 2.5 months. The cumulative DFS rates in the first, second, and third years were 75.6%, 52.5%, and 28.2%, respectively. The number of tumours and tumour distribution were determined as prognostic factors. No major complication was detected, but six patients (13.9%) developed minor complications after MWA. Conclusions Microwave ablation in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma is a safety treatment modality with very low rates of complications. It offers an effective treatment with a high rate of complete response and local disease control according to the short-term results. In the long term, it prolongs the survival time of the treated patients.

The intensity and duration of this first wave in the UK may be dependent on whether SARS-CoV-2 transmits more effectively in the winter than the summer and the UK Government response is partially built upon the assumption that those infected will develop immunity to reinfection in the short term. In this paper we examine evidence for seasonality and immunity to laboratory-confirmed seasonal coronavirus (HCoV) from a prospective cohort study in England. Methods: In this analysis of the Flu Watch cohort, we examine seasonal trends for PCR-confirmed coronavirus infections (HCoV-NL63, HCoV-OC43, and HCoV-229E) in all participants during winter seasons (2006-2007, 2007-2008, 2008-2009) and during the first wave of the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic (May-Sep 2009). We also included data from the pandemic and 'post-pandemic' winter seasons (2009-2010 and 2010-2011) to identify individuals with two confirmed HCoV infections and examine evidence for immunity against homologous reinfection. Results: We tested 1,104 swabs taken during respiratory illness and detected HCoV in 199 during the first four seasons. The rate of confirmed HCoV infection across all seasons was 390 (95% CI 338-448) per 100,000 person-weeks; highest in the Nov-Mar 2008/9 season at 674 (95%CI 537-835). The highest rate was in February at 759 (95% CI 580-975). Data collected during May-Sep 2009 showed there was small amounts of ongoing transmission, with four cases detected during this period. Eight participants had two confirmed infections, of which none had the same strain twice. Conclusion: Our results provide evidence that HCoV infection in England is most intense in winter, but that there is a small amount of ongoing transmission during summer periods. We found some evidence of immunity against homologous reinfection.","Aldridge, Robert W; Lewer, Dan; Beale, Sarah; Johnson, Anne M; Zambon, Maria; Hayward, Andrew C; Fragaszy, Ellen B",Wellcome open research,231,1

In clinical practice, physician judgement is the core method of identifying EOL care needs but has important limitations. Machine learning (ML) is a subset of artificial intelligence advancing capacity to identify patterns and make predictions using large datasets. ML approaches have the potential to improve clinical decision-making and policy design, but there has been no systematic assembly of current evidence. Methods: We conducted a rapid review, searching systematically seven databases from inception to December 31st, 2018: EMBASE, MEDLINE, Cochrane Library, PsycINFO, WOS, SCOPUS and ECONLIT. We included peer-reviewed studies that used ML approaches on routine data to improve palliative and EOL care for adults. Our specified outcomes were survival, quality of life (QoL), place of death, costs, and receipt of high-intensity treatment near end of life. We did not search grey literature and excluded material that was not a peer-reviewed article. Results: The database search identified 426 citations. We discarded 162 duplicates and screened 264 unique title/abstracts, of which 22 were forwarded for full text review. Three papers were included, 18 papers were excluded and one full text was sought but unobtainable. One paper predicted six-month mortality, one paper predicted 12-month mortality and one paper cross-referenced predicted 12-month mortality with healthcare spending. ML-informed models outperformed logistic regression in predicting mortality but poor prognosis is a weak driver of costs. Models using only routine administrative data had limited benefit from ML methods. Conclusion: While ML can in principle help to identify those at risk of adverse outcomes and inappropriate treatment near EOL, applications to policy and practice are formative. Future research must not only expand scope to other outcomes and longer timeframes, but also engage with individual preferences and ethical challenges.","Storick, Virginia; O'Herlihy, Aoife; Abdelhafeez, Sarah; Ahmed, Rakesh; May, Peter",HRB open research,231,16

Critically ill COVID-19 patients are often in a state of high inflammation, high stress, high catabolism, and their energy consumption increases significantly. All critically ill patients with COVID-19 should be screened for nutritional risk with NRS-2002 or Nutric tool in the early stage. If there is a risk of malnutrition, subjective global assessment (SGA) or Global Leadership Initiative on Malnutrition (GLIM) are further used for malnutrition assessment. After assessment, the daily energy, protein, electrolyte and liquid quantity needed by the patients should be determined according to the actual condition. Then, according to the degree of gastrointestinal function impairment in patients, the oral nutrition supplement, enteral nutrition, parenteral nutrition or their combination are selected for nutritional support. For patients with normal gastrointestinal function who require prone position ventilation or receive extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) treatment, enteral nutrition is recommended as the first choice. In addition, in the process of nutrition implementation, it is necessary to closely monitor the adverse reactions such as abdominal distention, diarrhea, regurgitation, phlebitis and liver function damage, timely adjust the nutrition program to ensure the smooth implementation of nutritional support. Based on the metabolic characteristics of critically ill patients with COVID-19, this paper makes a summary and suggestion on the following perspectives such as nutritional risk screening and assessment, target amount of nutritional treatment, nutritional intervention and treatment, nutritional support of special populations, and common adverse reactions in nutritional support treatment, so as to provide reference for individualized nutritional support therapy of critically ill patients with COVID-19.","Hu, Yan; Li, Xiaofeng; Gong, Weiyue",Zhejiang da xue xue bao.

To better understand the relationship between genomic make-up and different lifestyles, we have de novo sequenced a burnettii homokaryon and synchronised gene annotations with updated versions of the published genomes of var. bisporus. The genomes were assembled into telomere-to-telomere chromosomes and a consistent set of gene predictions was generated. The genomes of both subspecies were largely co-linear, and especially the chromosome ends differed in gene model content between the two subspecies. A single large cluster of repeats was found on each chromosome at the same respective position in all strains, harbouring nearly 50% of all repeats and likely representing centromeres. Repeats were all heavily methylated. Finally, a mapping population of var. burnettii confirmed an even distribution of crossovers in meiosis, contrasting the recombination landscape of var. bisporus. The new findings using the exceptionally complete and well annotated genomes of this basidiomycete demonstrate the importance for unravelling genetic components underlying the different life cycles.","Sonnenberg, Anton S M; Sedaghat-Telgerd, Narges; Lavrijssen, Brian; Ohm, Robin A; Hendrickx, Patrick M; Scholtmeijer, Karin; Baars, Johan J P; van Peer, A",Scientific reports,231,16

METHODS HLA-G tissue expression was assessed by immunohistochemistry in biopsies collected from 151 patients (90 CD, 61 UC) and in surgical resection specimens (28 CD, 12 UC). Surgical material from 24 healthy controls was also assessed. Plasma sHLA-G levels (97 CD, 81 UC, and 120 controls) were evaluated using ELISA. RESULTS HLA-G expression was similarly observed in the intestinal epithelial cells of control and CD/UC specimens. However, in biopsies, the plasma cells/lymphocytes infiltrating the lamina propria in CD/UC presented (1) increased HLA-G expression compared to controls (P < 0.0001), (2) greater cell staining in UC cells than in CD cells irrespective of disease extent (P = 0.0011), and (3) an increased number of infiltrating cells in the inflammatory CD phenotype compared to that in the stenosing and fistulizing phenotypes (P = 0.0407). In surgical specimens, CD/UC patients exhibited higher infiltrating cell HLA-G expression in lesion areas than in margins. sHLA-G levels were higher in UC/CD patients (P < 0.0001) than in controls, but no difference was observed between diseases. CONCLUSIONS Increased infiltrating cell HLA-G expression associated with increased sHLA-G levels in CD/UC patients may reflect ongoing host strategies to suppress chronic inflammation.","da Costa Ferreira, Sandro; Sadissou, Ibrahim Abiodoun; Parra, Rogério Serafim; Feitosa, Marley Ribeiro; Neto, Fermino Sanches Lizarte; Pretti da Cunha Tirapelli, Daniela; Ramalho, Leandra Naira Zambelli; Féres, Omar; da Rocha, José Joaquim Ribeiro; Donadi, Eduardo Antônio; de Almeida Troncon, Luiz Ernesto",Digestive diseases and sciences,231,1

The validated Persian version of self-report Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory™ Version 4.0 Generic Core Scales (PedsQL) for healthy adolescents was used in an online survey to assess HRQOL. Total, physical health, psychosocial health, emotional functioning, social functioning, and school functioning PedsQL scores were calculated, and impaired HRQOL was defined as > 1 standard deviation below the total population sample mean PedsQL scores. A validated food frequency questionnaire was used to assess dietary intakes during telephone interviews. Daily intakes of 20 predefined food groups were calculated and submitted to the principal component factor analysis to identify a-posteriori-defined dietary patterns. RESULTS Three major dietary patterns labeled as Mediterranean, mixed, and unhealthy were identified, of which only the Mediterranean pattern characterized by high intakes of vegetables, fruits, olives, potatoes, eggs, nuts and legumes, pickles, low-fat dairy, fish, poultry, and vegetable oils was consistently associated with HRQOL. Controlling for covariates in the multivariable-adjusted binary logistic regression analysis, participants in the top tertile of Mediterranean pattern score were less likely to have impaired HRQOL than those in the bottom tertile (total: OR 0.25; physical health: OR 0.35; psychosocial health: OR 0.15; emotional functioning: OR 0.17; social functioning: OR 0.15; and school functioning: OR 0.18; all P < 0.010).

METHODS We used the Premier database from 2012 to 2015 to examine trends in incidence of RYGB, adjustable gastric banding (LAGB), and SG; readmissions; and cost. Multivariate regression was performed to identify predictors of readmission. RESULTS The proportion of SG went up from 38 to 63% while the RYGB decreased from 44 to 30% over this time period. LAGB has decreased in use from 13 to 2%. In comparison to RYGB, readmission was less likely for SG (OR 0.64), males (OR 0.91), and more likely for black race (OR 1.27). The overall proportion of patients seeking RYGB with type 2 diabetes was higher than with SG (36 versus 25%), but SG has now overtaken RYGB as the most common procedure among diabetics. The SG is less costly than RYGB ($11,183 versus $13,485). CONCLUSIONS There is a continued overall trend in the increased popularity of the SG and decreased utilization of the RYGB and LAGB, although growth of the SG appears to be slowing. This is also true among patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Regardless of surgery type, underinsured and African-American race were more likely to be readmitted.","Kizy, Scott; Jahansouz, Cyrus; Downey, Michael C; Hevelone, Nathanael; Ikramuddin, Sayeed; Leslie, Daniel",Obesity surgery,231,26

However, no prophylactic and therapeutic agents specifically against MERS-CoV are currently available. Entry of MERS-CoV into target cells depends on binding of the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the viral envelope spike glycoprotein to the cellular receptor dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4). We report the isolation and characterization of two potent human RBD-specific neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (MERS-4 and MERS-27) derived from single-chain variable region fragments of a nonimmune human antibody library. MERS-4 and MERS-27 inhibited infection of both pseudotyped and live MERS-CoV with IC50 (half-maximal inhibitory concentration) at nanomolar concentrations. MERS-4 also showed inhibitory activity against syncytia formation mediated by interaction between MERS-CoV spike glycoprotein and DPP4. Combination of MERS-4 and MERS-27 demonstrated a synergistic effect in neutralization against pseudotyped MERS-CoV. Biochemical analysis indicated that MERS-4 and MERS-27 blocked RBD interaction with DPP4 on the cell surface. MERS-4, in particular, bound soluble RBD with an about 45-fold higher affinity than DPP4. Mutagenesis analysis suggested that MERS-4 and MERS-27 recognized distinct regions in RBD. These results suggest that MERS-4 and MERS-27 are RBD-specific potent inhibitors and could serve as promising candidates for prophylactic and therapeutic interventions against MERS-CoV infection.","Jiang, Liwei; Wang, Nianshuang; Zuo, Teng; Shi, Xuanling; Poon, Kwok-Man Vincent; Wu, Yongkang; Gao, Fei; Li, Danyang; Wang, Ruoke; Guo, Jianying; Fu, Lili; Yuen, Kwok-Yung; Zheng, Bo-Jian; Wang, Xinquan; Zhang, Linqi",Science translational medicine,231,17

METHODS Twelve well-trained male cyclists (V˙O2max, 4.49 ± 0.35 L·min) completed three constant-load cycling trials to the limit of tolerance in a randomized crossover design. Exercise intensities were set according to the respiratory responses to a preliminary ramp test to elicit cardiorespiratory and metabolic responses consistent with exercise in the severe and heavy exercise domains: 1) at power at V˙O2max (S+, 379 ± 31 W), 2) at 60% of the difference between gas exchange threshold and V˙O2max (S-, 305 ± 23 W), and 3) at the respiratory compensation point (RCP, 254 ± 26 W). Pre- and postexercise twitch responses from the quadriceps to the electrical stimulation of the femoral nerve and magnetic stimulation of the motor cortex were recorded to assess neuromuscular and corticospinal function, respectively. RESULTS Exercise time was 3.14 ± 0.59, 11.11 ± 1.86, and 42.14 ± 9.09 min for S+, S-, and RCP, respectively. All trials resulted in similar reductions in maximum voluntary force (P = 0.61). However, the degree of peripheral fatigue varied in an intensity-dependent manner, with greater reductions in potentiated twitch force after S+ (-33% ± 9%) compared with both S- (-16% ± 9%, P < 0.001) and RCP trials (-11% ± 9%, P < 0.001) and greater after S- compared with RCP (P < 0.05). For central fatigue, this trend was reversed, with smaller reductions in voluntary activation after S+ compared with RCP (-2.7% ± 2.2% vs -9.0% ± 4.7%, P < 0.01). CONCLUSION These data suggest the magnitude of peripheral and central fatigue after locomotor cycling exercise is exacerbated with exercise intensity and duration, respectively.","Thomas, Kevin; Elmeua, Marc; Howatson, Glyn; Goodall, Stuart",Medicine and science in sports and exercise,231,12

We assessed best available data on access and delivery of acute stroke unit care, intravenous thrombolysis and endovascular treatment throughout Europe. Methods A survey, drafted by stroke professionals (ESO, ESMINT, EAN) and a patient organisation (SAFE), was sent to national stroke societies and experts in 51 European countries (World Health Organization definition) requesting experts to provide national data on stroke unit, intravenous thrombolysis and endovascular treatment rates. We compared both pooled and individual national data per one million inhabitants and per 1000 annual incident ischaemic strokes with highest country rates. Population estimates were based on United Nations data, stroke incidences on the Global Burden of Disease Report. Results We obtained data from 44 European countries. The estimated mean number of stroke units was 2.9 per million inhabitants (95% CI 2.3-3.6) and 1.5 per 1000 annual incident strokes (95% CI 1.1-1.9), highest country rates were 9.2 and 5.8. Intravenous thrombolysis was provided in 42/44 countries. The estimated mean annual number of intravenous thrombolysis was 142.0 per million inhabitants (95% CI 107.4-176.7) and 72.7 per 1000 annual incident strokes (95% CI 54.2-91.2), highest country rates were 412.2 and 205.5. Endovascular treatment was provided in 40/44 countries. The estimated mean annual number of endovascular treatments was 37.1 per million inhabitants (95% CI 26.7-47.5) and 19.3 per 1000 annual incident strokes (95% CI 13.5-25.1), highest country rates were 111.5 and 55.9. Overall, 7.3% of incident ischaemic stroke patients received intravenous thrombolysis (95% CI 5.4-9.1) and 1.9% received endovascular treatment (95% CI 1.3-2.5), highest country rates were 20.6% and 5.6%. Conclusion We observed major inequalities in acute stroke treatment between and within 44 European countries. Our data will assist decision makers implementing tailored stroke care programmes for reducing stroke-related morbidity and mortality in Europe.","Aguiar de Sousa, Diana; von Martial, Rascha; Abilleira, Sònia; Gattringer, Thomas; Kobayashi, Adam; Gallofré, Miquel; Fazekas, Franz; Szikora, Istvan; Feigin, Valery; Caso, Valeria; Fischer, Urs",European stroke journal,231,1

To assess learner satisfaction with the format and content of the curriculum, including relevance to learners' education and practice. MATERIALS AND METHODS A webinar curriculum of fundamental reconstructive urology topics was developed through the Society of Genitourinary Reconstructive Surgeons and partnering institutions. Expert-led sessions were broadcasted. Registered participants were asked to complete a survey regarding the curriculum. Responses were used to assess the quality of the curriculum format and content, as well as participants' practice demographics. RESULTS Our survey yielded a response rate of 34%. Survey responses showed >50% of practices offer reconstructive urologic services, with 37% offered by providers without formal fellowship training. A difference in self-reported baseline knowledge was seen amongst junior residents and attendings (p<0.05). Regardless of level of training, all participants rated the topics presented as relevant to their education/practice (median response=5/5). Responders also indicated that the curriculum supplemented their knowledge in reconstructive urology (median response=5/5). The webinar format and overall satisfaction with the curriculum was highly rated (median response=5/5). Participants also stated they were likely to recommend the series to others. CONCLUSION We demonstrate success of an online curriculum in reconstructive urology. Given >50% of practices surveyed offer reconstruction, we believe the curriculum's educational benefits (increasing access and collaboration while minimizing the risk of in-person contact) will continue beyond the COVID-19 pandemic and that this will remain a relevant educational platform for urologists moving forward.","Omil-Lima, Danly; Fernstrum, Austin; Gupta, Karishma; Jella, Tarun; Muncey, Wade; Mishra, Kirtishri; Bukavina, Laura; Scarberry, Kyle; DeLong, Jessica; Nikolavsky, Dmitriy; Gupta, Shubham",Urology,231,1

The advantages and disadvantages of hand-sewn, linear-stapled, or circular-stapled anastomoses have been subject to debate in recent years. We explored a new method of end-to-side anastomosis using a circular stapler that embeds the anastomosis and the remaining esophageal tissue into the gastric cavity to reduce the occurrence of anastomotic leakage and to prevent gastroesophageal reflux. METHODS In 127 patients with esophageal carcinomas, end-to-side anastomoses with esophageal embedding were performed by connecting the anvil and body of the circular stapler inside the stomach before firing and embedding the anastomosis and remaining esophagus into the stomach after esophagectomy. Retrospective investigations on postoperative complications such as leakage, stricture, and gastroesophageal reflux were conducted. RESULTS A total of 123 patients (96.9%) had successful surgery, and 4 patients (3.3%) developed anastomotic leakage, with the total morbidity of 20 of 123 (16.3%) and in-hospital mortality of 1 of 123 (0.8%). The incidence of stricture (<1 cm) affected 14 of 123 patients (11.4%). Eight patients underwent dilatation treatment as a result of severe dysphagia (6.5%). Half of the patients [62 of 123 (50.4%)] experienced postoperative heartburn, 11 of 123 patients (8.9%) experienced acid regurgitation, and 16 of 123 patients (13.0%) experienced nocturnal cough. CONCLUSIONS Embedded cervical esophagogastrostomy with circular stapler is a simple and convenient method, with low incidence of anastomotic leakage and a good antireflux effect.","Wu, Sen; Chen, Mingyao; Wei, Li; Chen, Zhong",Annals of surgical oncology,231,17

However, bilateral RLNP has been rarely reported in esophagectomy patients. The objective of our study is to investigate the clinical significance of patients who had bilateral RLNP following esophagectomy. METHODS We retrospectively reviewed patients who underwent esophagectomy at a single center from 1994 to 2018. Among these, patients with bilateral vocal cord paralysis were included in this study. RESULTS A total of 3217 patients were reviewed and 400 (12.4%) patients had RLNP, including 56 patients with bilateral RLNP identified by laryngoscopic examination. During the postoperative managements, 10 of the 56 patients (17.9%) required tracheostomy. Among them, two died of acute respiratory distress syndrome and the other eight patients were discharged after removing the tracheostomy tube. The median lengths of hospital and intensive care unit stay were 19.5 (range 8-157) and 2 (range 1-46) days, respectively. Forty-six patients (83.6%) were discharged with oral feeding after swallowing therapy including tongue holding maneuver and head tilt exercise. The other five patients (8.9%) were discharged with alternative enteral feeding via jejunostomy, but they were able to achieve oral diet 2-3 months after surgery. CONCLUSION Bilateral RLNP following esophagectomy was rare, but it required great attention to prevent severe respiratory complications. However, only a few patients required tracheostomy and the majority achieved oral ingestion after intensive rehabilitation. Feeding education and respiratory rehabilitation are critical during the management of patients with bilateral RLNP.","Jeon, Yeong Jeong; Cho, Jong Ho; Lee, Hong Kyu; Kim, Hong Kwan; Choi, Yong Soo; Zo, Jae Ill; Shim, Young Mog",Thoracic cancer,231,16

MATERIALS AND METHODS Between February 2015 and April 2019, 236 patients with 236 BTNs (maximum diameter ≥2 cm) treated with ultrasound-guided MWA were enrolled. Contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) was performed within 3 d after ablation to determine whether there was residual tissue according to which the patients were assigned PA or complete ablation (CA). The volume reduction ratio (VRR) and complications were evaluated during follow-up. RESULTS Eighty-two patients were enrolled in the PA group, and 154 were enrolled in the CA group. Both groups achieved continuous reductions in nodule volume and increases in VRR within 2 years after ablation. Although the VRR of the PA group at 4 years was lower than that of the CA group (65.54 vs. 95.08%; p<.05), PA still achieved 'technical efficacy' with a volume reduction of more than 50%. The complication and side effect rates between the two groups showed no significant difference (p>.05). CONCLUSIONS Both PA and CA were safe and effective in reducing the volumes of BTNs in the long-term follow-up. For nodules with a large initial volume and dangerous location, PA with a small amount of residual tissue may be acceptable.","Cai, Wenjia; Liu, Sisi; Yu, Xiaoling; Han, Zhiyu; Cheng, Zhigang; Liu, Fangyi; Yu, Jie; Liang, Ping","International journal of hyperthermia : the official journal of European Society for Hyperthermic Oncology, North American Hyperthermia Group",231,26

A novel coronavirus, the so-called severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), was found to be responsible for this outbreak potentially originating from pangolins. In China, the outbreak lasted for 1 month until it seemed to be controlled after affecting over 81,000 individuals and causing deaths in over 4200 patients. Subsequently, and after affecting over 118,000 individuals and causing over 4200 deaths, the condition was officially announced as a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO). In the meantime, the epidemic curve took a downtrend in China, the original epicenter of the pandemic, but started to rise in other countries with a steep slope. Among over 215 affected countries, the USA, European countries (Italy, Germany, Spain, France, the UK), Iran, and South Korea had the highest frequencies in the matters of infected patients and deaths. Importantly, different countries took different policies when encountered with an outbreak, especially in the matter of accuracy of the report and timing of the action. A part of the delays in reporting was expected, including the lag in the chain of reporting, the shortcomings of tests, missed patients, and inadequate testing facilities. However, there were also political and nontechnical reasons that caused the reporting to be inaccurate. Surveillance seems to be less of a reason for the observed in poor management, and it mostly originated from human decision-making failures and political issues. Besides, the culture of populations and their trust in their governments played an important role on how they reacted to the COVID-19 pandemic and acquired policies. Finally, the characteristics of the world today indicate the danger of probable upcoming outbreaks, and policymakers should utilize the existing opportunities, particularly the advancements in technology and media, to prevent or adequately manage them.","Hanaei, Sara; Mohebi, Farnam; Moradi-Lakeh, Maziar; Jabbari, Parnian; Mehta, Surinder Kumar; Kryvenko, Liudmyla S; Luongo, Livio; Dupré, Loďc; Rezaei, Nima",Advances in experimental medicine and biology,231,31

Consequently, there are few treatments for many serious ailments, including neural-related injuries, myocardial infarction and focal hyaline cartilage defects. Tissue-engineered scaffolds offer great promise for addressing these wide-ranging indications; however, there are many considerations that need to be made when conceptualizing a product. For many applications, an in situ forming scaffold that could completely fill defects with complex geometries, adhere to adjacent tissues and foster cell proliferation would be ideal. Additionally, the scaffold would preferably have tailored mechanical properties similar to native tissues and highly controllable gelation kinetics, and would not require an external trigger, such as ultraviolet light, for gelation. We have developed a unique injectable hydrogel system composed of collagen and multi-armed poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) that meets all of these criteria. The collagen component enables cellular adhesion and permits enzymatic degradation, while the multi-armed PEG component has amine-reactive chemistry that also binds proteins/tissue and is hydrolytically degradable. We have characterized the mechanical properties, swelling, degradation rates and cytocompatibility of these novel hydrogels. The hydrogels demonstrated tunable mechanics, variable swelling and suitable degradation profiles. Cells adhered and proliferated to near confluence on the hydrogels over 7 days. These data suggest that these collagen and PEG hydrogels exhibit the mechanical, physical and biological properties suitable for use as an injectable tissue scaffold for the treatment of a variety of simple and complex tissue defects.","Sargeant, Timothy D; Desai, Arpan P; Banerjee, Saumya; Agawu, Atu; Stopek, Joshua B",Acta biomaterialia,231,31

METHODS Thirty-six patients (51-82 years) with vertebral localization of MM were randomly divided into two groups: 18 patients (group A) who underwent RFA and then vertebroplasty, and 18 patients (group B) who underwent only vertebroplasty. Primary endpoints were technical success and pain relief score rate measured by the visual analogue pain scores (VAS) and Roland-Morris Questionnaire (RMQ); secondary endpoint was the amount of administered analgesia. Survival and complications were compared. RESULTS Technical success was 100 % in both groups. The VAS score (at 24 h and 6 weeks postprocedure) decreased in equal manner for both groups from a mean of 9.1-3.4 and 2.0 for group A and from a mean of 9.3-3.0 and 2.3 for group B; RMQ mean score was 19.8 for group A and 19.9 for group B and decreased to a mean of 9.6 and 8.2 for group A and 9.5 and 8.7 for group B. The amount of medication was equally decreased in the two groups. No statistically significant difference was noted. No major complication occurred and two patients died from other causes. CONCLUSIONS The use of percutaneous vertebroplasty alone appears to be effective for the pain management of the patients with vertebral involvement of multiple myeloma. The use of RFA that includes cost and time does not offer any clear added benefit on the midterm pain management of such patients.","Orgera, Gianluigi; Krokidis, Miltiadis; Matteoli, Marco; Varano, Gianluca Maria; La Verde, Giacinto; David, Vincenzo; Rossi, Michele",Cardiovascular and interventional radiology,231,1

METHODS We compared the LVSS for (1) transecting bowel and (2) creation of an intestinal anastomosis with standard methods such as stapler (S) and hand-sewn (HS) in a porcine model. For each study arm, i.e., bowel transection and anastomosis creation, both the small bowel and colon were examined. In total, ten transections and ten anastomoses were performed for each. Burst and anastomotic leak pressures were compared. RESULTS In the study arm 1, LVSS achieved lowest burst pressures in both small bowel (LVSS 39.8 ± 3.6 mmHg, S 81.9 ± 3.9, HS 111.9 ± 14.7 mmHg, p < 0.0001) and colon transections (LVSS 21.5 ± 2.6 mmHg, S 79.5 ± 4.9, HS 91.0 ± 5.2 mmHg, p < 0.0001). There was no difference in burst pressures between S and HS in both small bowel and colon transections. In the study arm 2, LVSS showed the lowest anastomotic leak pressures for small bowel (LVSS 26.4 ± 2.6 mmHg, S 52.1 ± 6.2, HS 87.4 ± 7.0 mmHg, p < 0.0001) and colonic anastomoses (LVSS 16.9 ± 1.3 mmHg, S 55.9 ± 4.3, HS 74.4 ± 4.4 mmHg, p < 0.0001). Furthermore, small bowel and colonic anastomoses using S demonstrated significantly lower leak pressures than HS anastomosis p < 0.001 and p = 0.004, respectively. CONCLUSIONS The LVSS achieves significantly lower burst pressures and anastomotic leak pressures for bowel transection and intestinal anastomosis than S and HS techniques. However, due to the achieved pressure levels of 39.8 ± 3.6 mmHg, LVSS appears to be a sufficient stand-alone method for bowel transection. Whether it can be used to perform intestinal anastomosis warrants further research in a survival model.","Gehrig, Tobias; Billeter, A T; Wekerle, A L; Shevchenko, M; Brand, K; Müller-Stich, B P",Langenbeck's archives of surgery,231,1

MATERIALS AND METHODS This article conducted a literature review on information about the Stemona species in multiple electronic databases, including PubMed, Web of Science, Wiley, Science Direct, Elsevier, Google Scholar, ACS publications, SpringerLink, Elsevier, and China National Knowledge Internet. Information was also derived from other literature sources (e.g. Chinese Pharmacopoeia, 2015 edition, Chinese herbal classic books, PhD and MSc thesis, etc). RESULTS Our comprehensive analysis of the scientific literatures indicated that many Stemona species are popular and valuable herbal medicines with therapeutic potentials to treat various ailments. Phytochemical analyses identified alkaloids and stilbenoids as the major bioactive substances of Stemona species. Numerous studies have shown that the extracts and secondary metabolites isolated from these plants have a wide range pharmacological activity, including anti-inflammatory, antitussive, antitumour, cytotoxic, antimicrobial, insecticidal and antifeedant, and anti-virus activities. CONCLUSION Though plants of genus Stemona have been put to enormous traditional uses, the pharmacological studies conducted were insufficient. Nowadays, researches were mainly focused on the antitussive, anti-inflammatory as well as insecticidal and antifeedant activities. Therefore, more secondary metabolites need to be studied for more detailed pharmacological studies. Further studies are also required to establish the mechanisms which mediate the plants' bioactivities in relation to the medicinal uses as well as investigate any potential toxicity for future clinical studies.","Liu, Yaoqi; Shen, Yue; Teng, Li; Yang, Longfei; Cao, Kun; Fu, Qiang",Journal of ethnopharmacology,231,1

In order for AYAs, caregivers, clinicians, and other collaborators to optimize health outcomes (coproduction of health), understanding what living well means for AYAs who have experienced cancer is necessary. The objective was to develop an empirical definition of ""living well"" for AYAs who have experienced cancer to broadly understand AYA values and priorities. This definition may ultimately guide future conversations between caregivers and AYAs, eliciting thorough, personal definitions of living well from individual AYAs. Such conversations may enhance AYA participation in coproducing their health. PROCEDURE Qualitative analysis using a phenomenological approach of N = 30 structured Respecting Choices interviews conducted with AYAs (14-21 years; mean 84.2 [SD 69] months postcancer diagnosis with 21% on active treatment) from four tertiary pediatric hospitals in the context of a primary study of a pediatric advance care planning intervention trial. RESULTS AYAs who have experienced cancer conceptualized ""living well"" as maintaining physical, mental, and emotional health, as well as engaging in purposeful, age-appropriate activities with people important to them. Living well had three components: living mindfully, living an identity as a healthy AYA, and spending time with friends and family. CONCLUSIONS Conversations with AYAs who have experienced cancer elicited rich, complex concepts of ""living well."" Provider initiation of discussions about living well may facilitate personalized goals of care conversations. This study may serve as the basis to design and prototype future clinical interventions to enhance AYA engagement.","Schreiner, Katherine; Grossoehme, Daniel H; Friebert, Sarah; Baker, Justin N; Needle, Jennifer; Lyon, Maureen E",Pediatric blood & cancer,231,17

This complication often requires thoracotomy and is associated with prolonged pulmonary ventilation, long-term pleural draining due to persistent air leakage and development of a tracheopleural fistula, prolonged hospitalization, and high risk of septic and secondary cardiorespiratory complications. PRESENTATION OF CASE A 52-year-old woman complained of difficulty eating solid food, impaired swallowing, persistent pain behind the sternum, nausea, sickness and weight loss. EGD revealed tumor almost completely obturating the lumen in the middle third of the esophagus. The histopathological examination showed esophageal SCC. CT scan confirmed 33 × 29 × 55 mm tumor. The patient underwent thoracoscopic esophageal resection during which two defects of the tracheobronchial tree with sizes of 15 mm and 30 mm were detected and then successfully sewn using intracorporeal continuous Stratafix 3.0 suture. The patient was diagnosed with cancer of middle third of esophagus pT3N1M0, stage IIIB. DISCUSSION Thorough selection of patients undergoing thoracoscopic esophageal resection together with gentle manipulations with the esophagus in the area adjacent to the trachea can prevent intraoperative tracheobronchial damages. Timely diagnosis of such serious complications makes it possible to successfully manage them using thoracoscopic techniques. CONCLUSION Intraoperative tracheal and bronchial ruptures can be successfully managed with thoracoscopic intracorporeal suture.","Khitaryan, Аlexander; Miziev, Ismail; Veliev, Camil; Voronova, Olga; Golovina, Anastasiya; Zavgorodnyaya, Raisa; Kovalev, Sergey; Alibekov, Albert; Orekhov, Аlexey",International journal of surgery case reports,231,16

In this contributed paper, we show that polarization effects due to such dielectric mismatch remarkably influence the double-layer structure of a polyelectrolyte solution confined between two charged surfaces. Surprisingly, the electrostatic potential across the adsorbed polyelectrolyte double layer at the confining surface is found to decrease with increasing surface charge density, indicative of a negative differential capacitance. Furthermore, in the presence of polarization effects, the electrostatic energy stored in the double-layer structure is enhanced with an increase in the charge amplification, which is the absorption of ions on a like-charged surface. We also find that all of the important double-layer properties, such as charge amplification, energy storage, and differential capacitance, strongly depend on the polyelectrolyte backbone flexibility and the solvent quality. These interesting behaviors are attributed to the interplay between the conformational entropy of the confined polyelectrolytes, the Coulombic interaction between the charged species, and the repulsion from the surfaces with lower dielectric constant.","Bagchi, Debarshee; Nguyen, Trung Dac; Olvera de la Cruz, Monica",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,231,1

The effects of GHRH extend beyond the GH-insulin-like growth factor I axis, and that neuropeptide has been involved in the potentiation of several malignancies and other inflammatory disorders. The development of GHRH antagonists (GHRHAnt) delivers an exciting possibility to counteract the pathogenesis of the GHRH-related effects in human pathophysiology, especially when considered that GHRHAnt support endothelial barrier integrity. Those GHRHAnt-mediated effects are exerted at least in part due to the suppression of major inflammatory pathways, and the modulation of major cytoskeletal components. In the present study, we measured the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in bovine pulmonary artery endothelial cells, human cerebral microvascular endothelial cells, and human lung microvascular endothelial cells exposed to GHRH or a commercially available GHRHAnt. Our findings reveal the antioxidative effects of GHRHAnt in all three cell lines, which express GHRH receptors. The redox status of NIH/3T3 cells, which do not produce GHRH receptors, was not significantly affected by GHRH or GHRHAnt. Hence, the application of GHRHAnt in pathologies related to increased ROS production should be further investigated.","Akhter, Mohammad S; Barabutis, Nektarios",Journal of biochemical and molecular toxicology,231,7

Despite their efficacy, their use requires frequent monitoring and is complicated by drug-drug interactions and the need to maintain a narrow therapeutic window. Since 2009, novel oral anticoagulants (NOACs), including the direct thrombin inhibitor dabigatran and the direct factor Xa inhibitors apixaban, edoxaban, and rivaroxaban, have become alternative options to VKAs owing to their predictable and safe pharmacological profiles. The overall clinical effect of these drugs, which is a balance between ischaemic benefit and bleeding harm, varies according to the clinical scenario. As adjunctive therapy to dual antiplatelet therapy in patients with acute coronary syndrome, NOACs are associated with incremental bleeding risks and modest benefits. For treatment of VTE, NOACs have a safer profile than VKAs and a similar efficacy. In thromboprophylaxis in AF, NOACs are associated with the greatest benefits by reducing both ischaemic events and haemorrhagic complications and might reduce mortality compared with VKAs. The role of NOACs continues to evolve as these drugs are evaluated in different patient populations, including those with renal impairment or with AF and undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention.","Baber, Usman; Mastoris, Ioannis; Mehran, Roxana",Nature reviews.

However, the literature offers few reports and minimal evidence from small case series. The aim of this study was to evaluate the outcomes of pediatric MAAS through a multi-center data analysis. METHOD Pediatric patients who underwent MAAS between January 2002 and December 2013 were retrospectively included. Data analysis was conducted using Spss software (Welch's t-test, X-square, Fisher tests, multiple regression model). RESULTS Six European centers participated, 68 patients were included with mean age of 5.2 years (2 months-16 years). Lesion volume was of 18.1 cc (0.78-145.6), with a mean diameter of 2.8 cm (1.1-6.5). Localization was 50% left-sided masses, 45.6% right-side masses, and 4.4% bilateral. Histological examination revealed 36 neuroblastomas, 15 adenomas, nine pheochromocytomas, three ganglioneuromas, two ganglioneuroblastomas, one bilateral hyperplasia, one adrenocortical carcinoma, an alveolar sarcoma, and a calcification. Surgical access was transperitoneal in 63 (92.6%) and retroperitoneal in 5 (7.4%). Mean operative time was 170 ± 87 min (285 ± 30 min for bilateral lesions). Mean hospital stay was 4.2 ± 2.5 days. Complications included blood loss requiring transfusion in five patients (7.4%) and a diaphragmatic tear. Infiltration of surrounding structures correlated with intraoperative complication rate (p = 0.027) and operative time (p < 0.01). No mass rupture, conversion, or post-operative complications were observed. Median follow-up was 52 months (1-161). Two recurrences occurred in patients with pheochromocytoma. Age, weight, symptoms, characteristics at imaging, chemistry, volume, or histology, did not influence operative time, hospital stays, or complication rate. CONCLUSIONS Pediatric MAAS was safe adopted for masses up to 145.6 cc, with a very low rate of complication. Conversion to open is not necessary even in the presence of infiltrations. MAAS should represent the first-line treatment for selected cases in centers experienced in laparoscopy.","Fascetti-Leon, Francesco; Scotton, Giovanni; Pio, Luca; Beltrà, Raimundo; Caione, Paolo; Esposito, Ciro; Mattioli, Girolamo; Saxena, Amulya K; Sarnacki, Sabine; Gamba, Piergiorgio",Surgical endoscopy,231,22

Infants and very young children are especially vulnerable, and the 'Co-operative Study of Sickle Cell Disease' observed an incidence rate of 10 per 100 patient years of pneumococcal septicaemia in children under the age of three. Vaccines, including customary pneumococcal vaccines, may be of limited use in this age group. Therefore, prophylactic penicillin regimens may be advisable for this population. OBJECTIVES To assess the effects of prophylactic antibiotic regimens for preventing pneumococcal infection in children with sickle cell disease. SEARCH METHODS We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group Haemoglobinopathies Trials Register, which is comprised of references identified from comprehensive electronic database searches and handsearches of relevant journals and abstract books of conference proceedings.Date of the most recent search: 28 March 2012. SELECTION CRITERIA All randomised or quasi-randomised controlled trials comparing prophylactic antibiotics to prevent pneumococcal infection in children with sickle cell disease with placebo, no treatment or a comparator drug. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS Both authors independently extracted data and assessed trial quality. MAIN RESULTS Five trials were identified by the initial search, of which three trials met the inclusion criteria. All of the included trials showed a reduced incidence of infection in children with sickle cell disease (SS or Sβ0Thal) receiving prophylactic penicillin. In trials which investigated initiation of penicillin on risk of pneumococcal infection, the odds ratio was 0.37 (95% CI 0.16 to 0.86), while for withdrawal the odds ratio was 0.49 (95% CI 0.09 to 2.71). Adverse drug effects were rare and minor. Rates of pneumococcal infection were found to be relatively low in children over the age of five. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS Prophylactic penicillin significantly reduces risk of pneumococcal infection in children with homozygous sickle cell disease, and is associated with minimal adverse reactions. Further research may help to determine the ideal age to safely withdraw penicillin.","Hirst, Ceri; Owusu-Ofori, Shirley",The Cochrane database of systematic reviews,231,27

Ultrasound can be a useful contribution in arthroscopic diagnostic and therapeutic procedures. The main aim of the present study was to assess equivalence between endoscopic and external ultrasound for shoulder exploration. Secondary objectives comprised qualitative assessment of endoscopic ultrasound images and comparative assessment of acquisition time between the two techniques. MATERIAL AND METHODS An anatomic non-inferiority study was conducted on 6 shoulders from 3 subjects with a mean age of 84 years. After ultrasound examination by a radiologist specializing in osteoarticular imaging, shoulder arthroscopy was performed by a single specialized surgeon, using an ultrasound endoscope. Number of visualized structures and image quality were assessed by independent observers. RESULTS Ten of the 11 structures of interest (91%) were visualizable on endoscopic ultrasound, versus 4 (36%) on external ultrasound (p<0.05). Mean endoscopic acquisition time was 9.5±6.3minutes [range, 5;22]. In the 11 structures, image quality was better on endoscopic than external ultrasound, except for the acromioclavicular joint, where quality was better on external ultrasound, and the lateral side of the rotator cuff, where quality was equivalent.

Materials and Methods Forty-nine non-consecutive intracranial aneurysms underwent endovascular treatment using the PED exclusively between March 2011 and May 2017 at our institution. Primary endpoint was a favorable aneurysm occlusion defined as OKM C1-3 and D (O'Kelly Marotta Scale). Secondary endpoints were retreatment rate and delayed complications. Median follow-up was 200 days. Results The mean aneurysm size was 7.1 ± 5.3 mm. Forty-four aneurysms were located in the anterior circulation (90%). Ten aneurysms were ruptured (20%). Branching vessels from the sac were observed in 11 aneurysms (22%). Favorable obliteration immediately after PED placement was seen in 13/49 aneurysms (27%), of those nine aneurysms were completely occluded (18%). Angiographic and clinical follow-up was available for 45 cases (92%); 36/45 aneurysms (80%) were occluded completely and 40/45 aneurysms (89%) showed a favorable occlusion result. A branching vessel arising from the aneurysm sac was associated with incomplete occlusion (P < .05). All electively treated patients had good outcome (mRS 0). Three aneurysms (6%) required additional treatment due to aneurysm recurrence. Conclusion In our series, treatment of intracranial aneurysms with the PED was associated with favorable occlusion rates and low complication rates at mid-term follow-up. The presence of branching vessels arising from the aneurysms sac was predictive for an incomplete occlusion.","Volker, Maus; Anastasios, Mpotsaris; Jan, Borggrefe; Nuran, Abdullayev; Thomas, Liebig; Franziska, Dorn; Pantelis, Stavrinou; De-Hua, Chang; Christoph, Kabbasch",Neurointervention,231,16

How RPA is regulated to ensure the fidelity of DNA replication and repair remains poorly understood. Yeast Rtt105 is an RPA-interacting protein required for RPA nuclear import and efficient ssDNA binding. Here, we describe an important role of Rtt105 in high-fidelity DNA replication and recombination and demonstrate that these functions of Rtt105 primarily depend on its regulation of RPA. The deletion of RTT105 causes elevated spontaneous DNA mutations with large duplications or deletions mediated by microhomologies. Rtt105 is recruited to DNA double-stranded break (DSB) ends where it promotes RPA assembly and homologous recombination repair by gene conversion or break-induced replication. In contrast, Rtt105 attenuates DSB repair by the mutagenic single-strand annealing or alternative end joining pathway. Thus, Rtt105-mediated regulation of RPA promotes high-fidelity replication and recombination while suppressing repair by deleterious pathways. Finally, we show that the human RPA-interacting protein hRIP-α, a putative functional homolog of Rtt105, also stimulates RPA assembly on ssDNA, suggesting the conservation of an Rtt105-mediated mechanism.","Wang, Xuejie; Dong, Yang; Zhao, Xiaocong; Li, Jinbao; Lee, Jordan; Yan, Zhenxin; Yang, Shuangshuang; Wu, Wenqiang; Hou, Ximiao; Liu, Guangxue; Zhang, Yueyue; Song, Lun; Cai, Gang; Li, Qing; Ira, Grzegorz; Zhang, Xinghua; Chen, Xuefeng",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,231,19

The Pediatric Risk of Mortality is a physiologically based score used to quantify physiologic status, and when combined with other independent variables, it can compute expected mortality risk and expected morbidity risk. Although the physiologic ranges for the Pediatric Risk of Mortality variables have not changed, recent Pediatric Risk of Mortality data collection improvements have been made to adapt to new practice patterns, minimize bias, and reduce potential sources of error. These include changing the outcome to hospital survival/death for the first PICU admission only, shortening the data collection period and altering the Pediatric Risk of Mortality data collection period for patients admitted for ""optimizing"" care before cardiac surgery or interventional catheterization. This analysis incorporates those changes, assesses the potential for Pediatric Risk of Mortality physiologic variable subcategories to improve score performance, and recalibrates the Pediatric Risk of Mortality score, placing the algorithms (Pediatric Risk of Mortality IV) in the public domain. DESIGN Prospective cohort study from December 4, 2011, to April 7, 2013. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS Among 10,078 admissions, the unadjusted mortality rate was 2.7% (site range, 1.3-5.0%). Data were divided into derivation (75%) and validation (25%) sets. The new Pediatric Risk of Mortality prediction algorithm (Pediatric Risk of Mortality IV) includes the same Pediatric Risk of Mortality physiologic variable ranges with the subcategories of neurologic and nonneurologic Pediatric Risk of Mortality scores, age, admission source, cardiopulmonary arrest within 24 hours before admission, cancer, and low-risk systems of primary dysfunction. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for the development and validation sets was 0.88 ± 0.013 and 0.90 ± 0.018, respectively.

METHODS 120,409 adults with newly diagnosed T2DM from 2000-2018 were classified by the number of prevalent and incident comorbidities. Face to face and telephone primary care consultations with a nurse or physician were obtained. Crude and sex-age adjusted annual consultation rates and associated costs were calculated based on the number of comorbidities at the time of consultation. RESULTS The crude rate of face to face primary care consultations for patients without comorbidities was 10.3 (95% CI 10.3-10.4) per person year, 12.7 (12.7-12.7) for 1 comorbidity, 15.1 (15.1-15.2) for 2 comorbidities, and 18.7 (18.7-18.8) for 3 or more comorbidities. The mean annual inflation-adjusted cost for face to face consultations was £412.70 per patient without comorbidities, £516.80 for 1 comorbidity, £620.75 for 2 comorbidities, and £778.83 for 3 or more comorbidities. The age-sex adjusted face to face consultation rate changed an average of -3.3% (95% CI -4.4% to -2.3%) per year from 2000 to 2018 for patients without comorbidities, -2.7% (-4.0% to -1.3%) for 1 comorbidity, -2.2% (-3.3% to -1.2%) for 2 comorbidities, and -4.3% (-8.7% to +0.3%) for 3 or more comorbidities. CONCLUSIONS Though consultation rates for all patients decreased from 2000-2018, there was a significant disparity between the rate for patients with and without comorbidities.

Chronic alcohol abuse has been proposed as a predisposing factor despite lack of supporting evidence. Because alcohol and propofol have a common site of action, we postulated that paradoxical excitement responses during propofol-induced sedation occur more frequently in hazardous and harmful alcohol drinkers than in social or non-drinkers. METHODS One hundred and ninety patients undergoing orthopaedic knee joint surgery were enrolled in this prospective and observational study. Subjects were divided into Group HD (hazardous and harmful drinkers) or Group NHD (no hazardous drinkers) according to the alcohol use disorder identification test (AUDIT). In study 1, propofol infusion was adjusted to achieve the bispectral index at 70-80 using target-controlled infusion. In study 2, the target concentration of propofol was fixed at 0.8 (study 2/Low) or 1.4 μg ml(-1) (study 2/High). Paradoxical excitement responses were categorized by intensity into mild, moderate, or severe. RESULTS The overall incidence of paradoxical excitement response was higher in Group HD than in Group NHD in study 1 (71.4% vs 43.8%; P=0.022) and study 2/High (70.0% vs 34.5%; P=0.006) but not in study 2/Low. The incidence of moderate-to-severe response was significantly higher in Group HD of study 1 (28.6% vs 3.1%; P=0.0005) and study 2/High (23.3% vs 3.4%; P=0.029) with no difference in study 2/Low. Severe excitement response occurred only in Group HD of study 1 and study 2/High. CONCLUSIONS Paradoxical excitement occurred more frequently and severely in hazardous and harmful alcohol drinkers than in social drinkers during propofol-induced moderate-to-deep sedation, but not during light sedation.","Jeong, S; Lee, H G; Kim, W M; Jeong, C W; Lee, S H; Yoon, M H; Choi, J I",British journal of anaesthesia,231,16

Children living in rural areas and in the poorest households suffer the most from stunting across the country-43.2% in rural areas and 51.4% in the lowest wealth quintile. As a continuing public health concern, it is essential that stunting prevention is a national priority in order to ensure human capital development, especially among the poorest households. OBJECTIVE The primary objective of this study is to determine the effect of a medium quantity of a lipid-based nutrient supplement (LNS) combined with unconditional cash transfers and social and behavior change communication (SBCC) on reduction of stunting in children aged 6 to 23 months. METHODS A 5-arm cluster randomized controlled trial will be conducted in the district of Rahim Yar Khan in Punjab, Pakistan. The intervention packages will be (1) cash only, (2) cash with LNS, (3) cash with SBCC, and (4) cash with SBCC and LNS. The control arm will receive routine standard of care. We will enroll children at 6 months of age and follow up on a monthly basis up to 24 months of age. A total of 2000 children, 400 in each arm, will be enrolled to detect a 20% reduction in the prevalence of stunting among children aged 24 months. Length, weight, food intake, compliance to interventions, morbidities, and other relevant data will be collected at enrollment and on a monthly basis over the period of 18 months. The process evaluation will assess acceptability of the interventions and potential barriers to implementation through focus group discussions and in-depth interviews with the target population and relevant stakeholders. Furthermore, a cost analysis will be conducted to assess the cost-effectiveness of each intervention package. RESULTS The study protocol was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Aga Khan University in Pakistan on January 4, 2017. Data collection began in May 2017 and was completed in July 2019. Data analyses are yet to be completed. This study will explore the effectiveness of intervention packages comprised of cash transfers from Benazir Income Support Programme with or without additional LNS and SBCC in preventing childhood stunting. We expect the results to be published in peer-reviewed journals by autumn of 2020. CONCLUSIONS The findings of this trial will provide robust evidence as to which intervention packages can have significant effects on linear growth of children and design effective intervention packages to prevent stunting in children aged 6 to 23 months.

OBJECTIVE We investigated differences in SARS-CoV-2 test positivity and clinical outcomes of COVID-19 (composite endpoint: admission to intensive care unit, invasive ventilation, or death) between statin users and nonusers. METHODS Two independent population-based cohorts were analyzed, and we investigated the differences in SARS-CoV-2 test positivity and severe clinical outcomes of COVID-19, such as admission to the intensive care unit, invasive ventilation, or death, between statin users and nonusers. One group comprised an unmatched cohort of 214,207 patients who underwent SARS-CoV-2 testing from the Global Research Collaboration Project (GRCP)-COVID cohort, and the other group comprised an unmatched cohort of 74,866 patients who underwent SARS-CoV-2 testing from the National Health Insurance Service (NHIS)-COVID cohort. RESULTS The GRCP-COVID cohort with propensity score matching had 29,701 statin users and 29,701 matched nonusers. The SARS-CoV-2 test positivity rate was not associated with statin use (statin users, 2.82% [837/29,701]; nonusers, 2.65% [787/29,701]; adjusted relative risk [aRR] 0.97; 95% CI 0.88-1.07). Among patients with confirmed COVID-19 in the GRCP-COVID cohort, 804 were statin users and 1573 were matched nonusers. Statin users were associated with a decreased likelihood of severe clinical outcomes (statin users, 3.98% [32/804]; nonusers, 5.40% [85/1573]; aRR 0.62; 95% CI 0.41-0.91) and length of hospital stay (statin users, 23.8 days; nonusers, 26.3 days; adjusted mean difference -2.87; 95% CI -5.68 to -0.93) than nonusers. The results of the NHIS-COVID cohort were similar to the primary results of the GRCP-COVID cohort. CONCLUSIONS Our findings indicate that prior statin use is related to a decreased risk of worsening clinical outcomes of COVID-19 and length of hospital stay but not to that of SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Lee, Seung Won; Kim, So Young; Moon, Sung Yong; Yoo, In Kyung; Yoo, Eun-Gyong; Eom, Gwang Hyeon; Kim, Jae-Min; Shin, Jae Il; Jeong, Myung Ho; Yang, Jee Myung; Yon, Dong Keon",JMIR public health and surveillance,231,1

Methods We first sought to estimate the vertical transmission rate of congenital CMV infection in twins by gathering cohort-based studies of congenital CMV in which vertical transmission in both singleton and twin pregnancies was reported. This also allowed us to compare singleton and twin infection rates. From the above studies and other large cohorts of congenitally infected infants, the percentage of discordantly infected twin pairs determined whether this is a rare phenomenon. Theorizing discordance is not rare, we then analyzed data from cases with twin outcomes for congenital CMV infection, according to whether the twins were monozygotic or dizygotic, and calculated their corresponding concordance rates to estimate the broad-sense heritability. Lastly, we described other factors that might affect vertical transmission. Results From five articles following at-risk pregnancies, the rate of vertical transmission in twin pregnancies is 58.7% (95% CI 43.3-72.3%) whereas in singleton pregnancies it is 31.4% (95% CI: 29.0-34.0%) p = 0.0002. Of ten studies of larger cohorts of infants with congenital CMV infection, 21 of 42 twin pairs with at least one twin infected were discordant for congenital CMV (50.0%, 95% CI: 34.4-65.6%) indicating discordance of congenital CMV infection in twin pairs is not rare. Of 28 studies covering 37 twin pairs where at least one twin had congenital CMV, and zygosity was known, eleven of thirteen monozygotic twin pairs (84.6%; 95% CI: 53.7-97.3%) were concordant for CMV infection, and nine of twenty-four dizygotic twin pairs (37.5%; 95% CI: 19.6-59.2%) were concordant for infection giving an estimated hereditability of 94.2%. Within these 37 twin pairs, factors such as primary or recurrent maternal infection, prematurity, growth discordance, and sex are described; however, in many of these cases these factors are unknown. Conclusion The rate of vertical transmission of congenital CMV is higher for twins than singletons. Discordance of congenital CMV in twins is not rare and suggests a possible genetic susceptibility to congenital CMV.","Hutton, Jill; Rowan, Paul J",Frontiers in cellular and infection microbiology,231,1

Occurrence or increase in fatty degeneration may depend on the surgical technique. QUESTIONS/PURPOSES We (1) assessed fatty degeneration in the subscapularis muscle and its cross-sectional area after a C-block osteotomy of the lesser tuberosity with minimal mobilization of the subscapularis muscle, and (2) determined whether this technique had any adverse effect on function, fatty degeneration, and cross-sectional area of the subscapularis muscle. METHODS We retrospectively examined 36 patients with shoulder replacements who had C-block osteotomies. Constant-Murley scores and clinical signs of subscapularis insufficiency were recorded. We radiographically assessed prosthetic placement. On CT scans, lesser tuberosity healing, fatty degeneration, and cross-sectional area of the subscapularis muscle were determined. The minimum followup was 13 months (mean, 18 months; range, 13-33 months). RESULTS The mean absolute Constant-Murley score was 71.2. Two patients had weakness of the subscapularis muscle without loss of active motion. All tuberosities healed anatomically. A normal glenohumeral relationship was found in all cases. Fatty degeneration was Grade 0 in 44%, Grade 1 in 39%, Grade 2 in 14%, and Grade 3 in 3%. The subscapularis muscular cross-sectional area decreased from 16.7 cm(2) preoperatively to 14.5 cm(2) postoperatively (13%). CONCLUSIONS The C-block osteotomy with minimal dissection of the subscapularis is associated with a low incidence of fatty degeneration in the subscapularis muscle after shoulder arthroplasty although the muscular cross-sectional area of the subscapularis decreased.

RECENT FINDINGS Recent studies highlight that there continue to be multiple barriers to LGBT individuals with cancer receiving equity of care. These include healthcare professionals (HCPs) lack of knowledge of LGBT-specific issues and an under appreciation of the importance of sexuality and gender in order to provide holistic, person-centred care. Suggestions are made of how embedding training, updating guidelines, and improving communication skills could help to address this care disparity. SUMMARY Lesbian, gay, bisexual and/or trans (LGBT) individuals have an increased risk of certain illnesses, including certain types of cancer. They belong to a minority group, who may be subjected to discrimination and so are less likely to present for screening or engage with healthcare professionals. This review of recent studies highlights that LGBT individuals still fear discrimination from HCPs, and that many HCPs themselves admit to poor knowledge of LGBT specific issues and the importance of sexuality and gender identity when providing cancer care. Advances in education programmes, including enhanced communication skills and creating LGBT safe spaces are all vital in reducing the disparity in LGBT cancer care.","Wakefield, Donna",Current opinion in supportive and palliative care,231,1

Samples were taken at day 0 (prechallenge), day 14 (peak viremia), and week 12 (set point) from animals immunized with replicating adenovirus type 5 host range (Ad5hr) recombinant viruses expressing human immunodeficiency virus HIV(env)(89.6P), simian immunodeficiency virus SIV(gag)(239), or SIV(nef)(239) alone or in combination with two intramuscular boosts with HIV(89.6P)gp140ΔCFI protein (L. J. Patterson et al., Virology 374:322-337, 2008), and each treatment resulted in significant control of viremia following simian-human immunodeficiency virus SHIV(89.6P) challenge (six animals per group plus six controls). At day 0, 8 weeks after the last treatment, the microarray profiles revealed significant prechallenge differences between treatment groups; data from the best-protected animals led to identification of a network of genes related to B cell development and lymphocyte survival. At peak viremia, expression profiles of the immunized groups were extremely similar, and comparisons to control animals reflected immunological differences other than effector T cell functions. Suggested protective mechanisms for vaccinated animals included upregulation of interleukin-27, a cytokine known to inhibit lentivirus replication, and increased expression of complement components, which may synergize with vaccine-induced antibodies. Divergent expression profiles at set point for the immunized groups implied distinct immunological responses despite phenotypic similarities in viral load and CD4(+) T cell levels. Data for the gp140-boosted group provided evidence for antibody-dependent, cell-mediated viral control, whereas animals immunized with only the replicating Ad5hr recombinants exhibited a different evolution of the B cell compartment even at 3 months postchallenge. This study demonstrates the sensitivity and discrimination of gene expression profiling of whole blood as an analytical tool in AIDS vaccine trials, providing unique insights into in vivo mechanisms and potential correlates of protection.","Palermo, Robert E; Patterson, L Jean; Aicher, Lauri D; Korth, Marcus J; Robert-Guroff, Marjorie; Katze, Michael G",Journal of virology,231,1

This study examined the potentially unique and synergistic roles of individual differences in neurocognition and health literacy in the early uptake and use of COVID-19 public health information.Method: Data were collected between April 23 and 21 May 2020, a period during which 42 out of 50 states were under a stay-at-home order. Participants were 217 healthy adults who completed a telephone-based battery that included standard tests of neurocognition, health literacy, verbal IQ, personality, and anxiety. Participants also completed measures of COVID-19 information-seeking skills, knowledge, prevention intentions, and prevention behaviors.Results: A series of hierarchical multiple regressions with data-driven covariates showed that neurocognition (viz, episodic verbal memory and executive functions) was independently related to COVID-19 knowledge (e.g. symptoms, risks) at a medium effect size, but not to information-seeking skills, prevention intentions, or prevention behaviors. Health literacy was independently related to all measured aspects of COVID-19 health information and did not interact with neurocognition in any COVID-19 health domain.Conclusions: Individual differences in neurocognition and health literacy played independent and meaningful roles in the initial acquisition of knowledge related to COVID-19, which is a novel human health condition. Future studies might examine whether neurocognitive supports (e.g. spaced retrieval practice, elaboration) can improve COVID-19-related knowledge and health behaviors in vulnerable populations.","Babicz, Michelle A; Woods, Steven Paul; Matchanova, Anastasia; Medina, Luis D; Podell, Kenneth; Walker, Rheeda L; Fetterman, Adam; Rahman, Samina; Johnson, Briana; Thompson, Jennifer L; Sullivan, Kelli L; Beltran-Najera, Ilex; Brooks, Jasmin; Morales, Yenifer; Avci, Gunes",Journal of clinical and experimental neuropsychology,231,8

Current treatment protocols do not prevent graft reinfection and, in addition, an accelerated disease progression is observed. In the present study, we have evaluated a novel strategy to prevent HCV infection using a lectin, griffithsin (GRFT) that specifically binds N-linked high-mannose oligosaccharides that are present on the viral envelope. The antiviral effect of GRFT was evaluated in vitro using the HCV pseudoparticle (HCVpp) and HCV cell culture (HCVcc) systems. We show here that preincubation of HCVpp and HCVcc with GRFT prevents infection of Huh-7 hepatoma cells. Furthermore, GRFT interferes with direct cell-to-cell transmission of HCV. GRFT acts at an early phase of the viral life cycle by interfering in a genotype-independent fashion with the interaction between the viral envelope proteins and the viral receptor CD81. The capacity of GRFT to prevent infection in vivo was evaluated using uPA(+/+)-SCID mice (uPA stands for urokinase-type plasminogen activator) that harbor human primary hepatocytes in their liver (chimeric mice). In this proof-of-concept trial, we demonstrated that GRFT can mitigate HCV infection of chimeric mice. Treated animals that did become infected demonstrated a considerable delay in the kinetics of the viral infection.

In addition, nutritional factors are other key regulators for the homeostasis of host immunity, but whether and how nutrition affects the homeostatic generation of thymocytes remains to be established. Here, we showed that vitamin B1 deficiency resulted in a bias toward the maturation of γδ thymocytes accompanied by decreased differentiation into double-positive thymocytes during thymic involution. These events were mediated through the increased production of TGF-β superfamily members due to the accumulation of branched-chain α-keto acids in thymic stromal cells. These findings revealed essential roles of vitamin B1 in the appropriate differentiation of T cells through the metabolism of thymic stromal cells.","Hirata, So-Ichiro; Sawane, Kento; Adachi, Jun; Isoyama, Junko; Sugiura, Yuki; Matsunaga, Ayu; Hosomi, Koji; Tomonaga, Takeshi; Suematsu, Makoto; Nagatake, Takahiro; Kunisawa, Jun",iScience,231,16

N-gene detection rates were higher in the Chugoku and Kyushu regions than in the remaining surveyed regions. Phylogenetic analysis of S1 gene sequences revealed that JP-I, JP-II, JP-III, and Massachusetts genotypes were particularly prevalent, with JP-I isolated throughout the country. Additionally, JP-II was the genotype detected most frequently in Chugoku, and JP-III was the most frequent in Kyushu. Unlike the previous results obtained in 1998 through 2003, the European-prevalent 4/91 genotype was no longer circulating in Japan.

Although FDG-PET is not indicated for the initial diagnosis of breast cancer, focally increased glucose metabolism within breast tissue represents a high likelihood for a neoplastic process and requires further evaluation. Focally increased glucose metabolism is not unique to breast cancer. Other malignancies such as lymphoma, metastases from solid tumors as well as inflammatory changes also may demonstrate increased glucose metabolism either within the breast or at other sites throughout the body. Importantly, benign breast disease may also exhibit increased glucose metabolism, limiting the specificity of FDG-PET. Breast cancer has a wide range of metabolic activity attributed to tumor heterogeneity and breast cancer subtype. Intracellular signaling pathways regulating tumor glucose utilization contribute to these pitfalls of PET/CT in breast cancer. The evaluation of axillary lymph nodes by FDG-PET is less accurate than sentinel lymph node procedure, however is very accurate in identifying level II and III axillary lymph node metastases or retropectoral metastases. It is important to note that non-malignant inflammation in lymph nodes are often detected by modern PET/CT technology. Therefore, particular consideration should be given to recent vaccinations, particularly to COVID-19, which can commonly result in increased metabolic activity of axillary nodes. Whole body FDG-PET for staging of breast cancer requires specific attention to physiologic variants of FDG distribution and a careful comparison with co-registered anatomical imaging. The most important pitfalls are related to inflammatory changes including sarcoidosis, sarcoid like reactions, and other granulomatous diseases as well as secondary neoplastic processes.","Kikano, Elias George; Avril, Stefanie; Marshall, Holly; Jones, Robert Stanley; Montero, Alberto J; Avril, Norbert",Seminars in nuclear medicine,231,1

METHODS We retrospectively identified otherwise healthy children hospitalized over a 3-year period at a single institution with community-acquired pneumonia who had an RVP performed within 24 hours of admission. We examined associations between RVP results and clinical outcomes as well as management decisions including initiation and duration of intravenous antibiotics. RESULTS Among 202 children, a positive RVP (n = 127, 63%) was associated with a more complicated clinical course, although this was due largely to more severe disease seen in younger children and those with respiratory syncytial virus (n = 38, 30% of positive detections). Detection of a virus did not influence antibiotic therapy. Included children were younger and had more severe illness than children hospitalized with pneumonia at the same institution without an RVP obtained. CONCLUSIONS In our study, only respiratory syncytial virus was associated with a more severe clinical course compared with RVP-negative children. Regardless of the virus detected, RVP positivity did not influence antibiotic usage. However, RVP use focused primarily on children with severe pneumonia. Whether similar testing influences management decisions among children with less severe illness deserves further study.","Schulert, Grant S; Hain, Paul D; Williams, Derek J",Hospital pediatrics,231,20

An appropriately tuned cationic pincer cobalt(I) complex featuring a central silylene donor reacts with CO2 to afford a bimetallic siloxane featuring two Co(II) centers with liberation of CO, and reaction with ethylene yields a similar bimetallic complex with an ethylene bridge. Experimental and computational studies suggest a plausible mechanism proceeding via [2+2]-cycloaddition to the silylene complex that is quite sensitive to steric environment. The Co(II)/Co(II) products are further reactive to oxidation and reduction.

METHODS Forty-two patients underwent ileostomy closure by a single surgeon and were managed by a standardized postoperative care pathway. On the first postoperative day, patients received oral analgesia and a soft diet. Discharge was based on standard criteria previously published for laparoscopic colectomy patients. Results were recorded prospectively in an Institutional Review Board-approved database, including demographics, operative time, blood loss, complications, length of stay, and readmission data. RESULTS The median operative time and blood loss were 60 minutes and 17.5 mL, respectively, and median hospital stay was 2 days. Twenty-nine patients (69 percent) were discharged by postoperative Day 2. The complication rate was 23.8 percent; complications included prolonged postoperative ileus (n = 3), early postoperative small-bowel obstruction (n = 1), mortality not related to ileostomy closure (n = 1), minor bleeding (n = 1), wound infection (n = 1), incisional hernia (n = 1), diarrhea (n = 1), dehydration (n = 1). The 30-day readmission rate was 9.5 percent (n = 4). Two patients had reoperation within 30 days for small-bowel obstruction and a wound infection. CONCLUSIONS Ileostomy closure patients managed with postoperative care pathways can have a short hospital stay with acceptable morbidity and readmission rates.","Joh, Yong-Geul; Lindsetmo, Rolv-Ole; Stulberg, Jonah; Obias, Vincent; Champagne, Brad; Delaney, Conor P",Diseases of the colon and rectum,231,12

CPAP is a simple and effective respiratory support modality used to support neonates with respiratory failure and can be used in low-income and middle-income countries. The goal of this study was to describe implementation of the Silverman-Andersen respiratory severity score (RSS) and bubble CPAP in a rural Ugandan neonatal NICU. We sought to determine whether physicians and nurses in a low-income/middle-income setting would assign similar RSS in neonates after an initial training period and over time. METHODS We describe the process of training NICU staff to use the RSS to assist in decision making regarding initiation, titration, and termination of bubble CPAP for neonates with respiratory distress. Characteristics of all neonates with respiratory failure treated with bubble CPAP in a rural Ugandan NICU from January to June 2012 are provided. RESULTS Nineteen NICU staff members (4 doctors and 15 nurses) received RSS training. After this, the Spearman correlation coefficient for respiratory severity scoring between doctor and nurse was 0.73. Twenty-one infants, all < 3 d of age, were treated with CPAP, with 17 infants starting on the day of birth. The majority of infants (16/21, 76%) were preterm, 10 (48%) were <1,500 g (birthweight), and 13 (62%) were outborn. The most common diagnoses were respiratory distress syndrome (16/21, 76%) and birth asphyxia (5/21, 24%). The average RSS was 7.4 ± 1.3 before starting CPAP, 5.2 ± 2.3 after 2-4 h of CPAP, 4.9 ± 2.7 after 12-24 h of CPAP, and 3.5 ± 1.9 before CPAP was discontinued. Duration of treatment with CPAP averaged 79 ± 43 h. Approximately half (11/21, 52%) of infants treated with CPAP survived to discharge. CONCLUSIONS Implementing bubble CPAP in a low-income/middle-income setting is feasible. The RSS may be a simple and useful tool for monitoring a neonate's respiratory status and for guiding CPAP management.","McAdams, Ryan M; Hedstrom, Anna B; DiBlasi, Robert M; Mant, Jill E; Nyonyintono, James; Otai, Christine D; Lester, Debbie A; Batra, Maneesh",Respiratory care,231,1

It is reasoned that PA may play the potential benefits against cystitis glandularis (CG), an inflammation of the bladder tissue. In this study, we aimed to apply the network pharmacology and molecular docking analyses to reveal concrete anti-CG targets and mechanisms of PA, and then the bioinformatic findings were verified by using clinical and animal samples. The methodological data from network pharmacology approach showed that 303 and 243 reporting targets of CG and PA, and other 31 shared targets of CG and PA were identified. Subsequently, all top targets of PA against CG were screened out, including cyclooxygenase-2, epidermal growth factor receptor, tumor antigen p53 (TP53), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF), interleukin-1 (IL-1) beta, proto-oncogene c-jun. Molecular docking data demonstrated that PA exerted potent bonding capacities with TNF, TP53 proteins in CG. In human study, the findings suggested that overactivated TNF-α expression and suppressed TP53 activation were detected in CG samples. In animal study, PA-treated mice showed reduced intravesical IL-1, IL-6 levels, and lactate dehydrogenase content, downregulated TNF-α and upregulated TP53 proteins in bladder samples. Taken together, our bioinformatics and experimental findings identify the key anti-CG biotargets and mechanisms of PA. More markedly, these pivotal pharmacological targets of PA against CG have been screened out and verified by using computational and experimental analyses.","Feng, Zihao; Shi, Hailin; Liang, Bojian; Ge, Tianyu; Cai, Menghui; Liu, Feng; Huang, Kunping; Wen, Jintao; Chen, Qiuhong; Ge, Bo",BioFactors,231,1

In more concentrated gels, endblock aggregates persist into the isotopic phase. Dramatic changes in network structure are observed over small temperature windows (as little as 1 °C) due to tccche rapidly changing LC order near the isotropization point. The discontinuous change in solvent quality produces an abrupt change in viscoelastic properties for three polymers having different pendant mesogenic groups and matched block lengths.","Kempe, Michael D; Verduzco, Rafael; Scruggs, Neal R; Kornfield, Julia A",Soft matter,231,1

Prospective memory (PM) is reliably impaired in HIV disease and is related to laboratory-based measures of medication management capacity in other populations. This study examined whether PM shows veridicality in relationship to online pharmacy navigation skills in persons with HIV disease. METHOD Participants included 98 persons with HIV disease age 50 and older who completed the Cambridge Prospective Memory Test (CAMPROMPT) and the Medication-Management Test-Revised (MMT-R) as part of a neuropsychological study. Participants also completed the Test of Online Pharmacy Skills (TOPS), which required them to navigate a simulated, experimenter-controlled online pharmacy to perform several naturalistic tasks (e.g., refill an existing prescription). RESULTS Lower PM had medium associations with poorer MMT-R and TOPS accuracy scores that were not better explained by other neurocognitive functions. The association between PM and TOPS accuracy was driven by errors of omission and did not vary meaningfully based on whether the intention was cued by time or an event. CONCLUSIONS These data suggest that PM cue detection processes show veridicality with online pharmacy navigation skills. Future studies might examine the benefits of PM-based strategies (e.g., salient prompts) in supporting online health navigation skills in populations that experience clinically impactful PM failures.","Matchanova, Anastasia; Woods, Steven Paul; Cushman, Clint; Morgan, Erin E; Medina, Luis D; Babicz, Michelle A; Verduzco, Marizela; Loft, Shayne",The Clinical neuropsychologist,231,31

MicroRNAs can regulate placental development and contribute to disease, by influencing gene expression. Our previous study revealed an increase in miR-193b-5p expression in placentae from patients with early-onset pregnancy complications and identified candidate gene targets for miR-193b-5p. The purpose of this study is two-fold, first to validate candidate gene targets predicted for miR-193b-5p from microRNA-RNA expression data. Second, to overexpress miR-193b-5p in a trophoblast cell line (HTR-8/SVneo) to assess impact on trophoblast cell proliferation and migration. Integration of the miRNA and RNA sequencing expression data revealed 10 candidate gene targets for miR-193b-5p across all patient groups (PE only, IUGR only, PE + IUGR). Luciferase experiments identified two gene targets for miR-193b-5p, APLN and FGF13. Real-time PCR confirmed a median 45% decrease of FGF13 expression across 3 patient groups, and 50% decrease of APLN expression in patients with PE + IUGR. Following transfection of HTR-8/SVneo cells with miR-193b-5p mimics, APLN and FGF13 mRNA expression in HTR-8/SVneo was reduced by a median percentage of 30% and 45%, respectively. Concomitantly, HTR-8/SVneo cells demonstrate 40% reduction in cell migration. APLN and FGF13 immunoreactivity was identified strongly in the cytotrophoblast cells of the human placentae.

Independent, well-powered studies could further our understanding of this association. Objective To examine whether low levels of vitamin D are associated with SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity, an indicator of previous infection. Design, Setting, and Participants This is a cohort study of employees and spouses who elected to be tested for SARS-CoV-2 IgG as part of an annual employer-sponsored health screening program conducted in August to November 2020. This program includes commonly assessed demographic, biometric, and laboratory variables, including total vitamin D measurement. Baseline (prepandemic) levels of vitamin D and potential confounders were obtained from screening results from the previous year (September 2019 to January 2020). Data analysis was performed from December 2020 to March 2021. Exposures Low total serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D, defined as either less than 20 ng/mL or less than 30 ng/mL. Main Outcomes and Measures The main outcome was SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity, as determined with US Food and Drug Administration emergency use-authorized assays. The association of SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity with vitamin D levels was assessed by multivariable logistic regression analyses and propensity score analyses. Results The 18 148 individuals included in this study had test results for SARS-CoV-2 IgG in 2020 and vitamin D levels from the prepandemic and pandemic periods. Their median (interquartile range) age was 47 (37-56) years, 12 170 (67.1%) were women, 900 (5.0%) were seropositive, 4498 (24.8%) had a vitamin D level less than 20 ng/mL, and 10 876 (59.9%) had a vitamin D level less than 30 ng/mL before the pandemic. In multivariable models adjusting for age, sex, race/ethnicity, education, body mass index, blood pressure, smoking status, and geographical location, SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity was not associated with having a vitamin D level less than 20 ng/mL before (odds ratio [OR], 1.04; 95% CI, 0.88-1.22) or during (OR, 0.93; 95% CI, 0.79-1.09) the pandemic; it was also not associated with having a vitamin D level less than 30 ng/mL before (OR, 1.09; 95% CI, 0.93-1.27) or during (OR, 1.05; 95% CI, 0.91-1.23) the pandemic.

Infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) typically manifests as fever, cough, shortness of breath, and exhibits radiographic evidence of bilateral pneumonic infiltrates. Recent meta-analyses have shown that myocardial injury, including viral myocarditis, is prevalent among infected patients, especially in patients requiring ICU level care.

However, under severe and persistent ER stress, prolonged UPR may activate unique pathways that lead to cell death. In this study, we investigated the activation of the protein kinase R-like ER kinase (PERK) pathway of UPR in cells infected with the coronavirus infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) and its relationship with IBV-induced apoptosis. The results showed moderate induction of PERK phosphorylation in IBV-infected cells. Meanwhile, activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4) was upregulated at the protein level in the infected cells, resulting in the induction in trans of the transcription factor ATF3 and the proapoptotic growth arrest and DNA damage-inducible protein GADD153. Knockdown of PERK by small interfering RNA (siRNA) suppressed the activation of GADD153 and the IBV-induced apoptosis. Interestingly, knockdown of protein kinase R (PKR) by siRNA and inhibition of the PKR kinase activity by 2-aminopurine (2-AP) also reduced the IBV-induced upregulation of GADD153 and apoptosis induction. In GADD153-knockdown cells, IBV-induced apoptosis was suppressed and virus replication inhibited, revealing a key role of GADD153 in IBV-induced cell death and virus replication. Analysis of the pathways downstream of GADD153 revealed much more activation of the extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK) pathway in GADD153-knockdown cells during IBV infection, indicating that GADD153 may modulate apoptosis through suppression of the pathway. This study provides solid evidence that induction of GADD153 by PERK and PKR plays an important regulatory role in the apoptotic process triggered by IBV infection.","Liao, Ying; Fung, To Sing; Huang, Mei; Fang, Shou Guo; Zhong, Yanxin; Liu, Ding Xiang",Journal of virology,231,27

OBJECTIVE To describe the FDMNs presenting for care at public health facilities in Bangladesh so as to understand the health problems faced by the FDMNs and the burden on these public health facilities. METHODS This study combined a retrospective review of existing hospital and clinic data with prospective surveillance in government health care centres. FINDINGS The retrospective data showed a 26% increase in the number of consultations at the Kutupalong community clinic, the primary health facility closest to the camps, from 19,567 in 2015 to 26,309 in 2019. There was a corresponding 11% increase in admissions to health facilities in the area, from 80,991 in 2017 to 91,424 in 2019. Prospective surveillance of 9,421 FDMNs seeking health care from July 2018 to December 2019 showed that 29% had an infectious disease, 20% nutritional problems, 12% pregnancy-related conditions and 7% trauma or injury. CONCLUSIONS Great uncertainty remains regarding the return of FDMN to their home country of Myanmar. The current on-going protests following the military coup adds further insecurity to the status of the Rohingya.

At the institutional meso level, we question whether curricula could include more than core entrustable professional activities (EPAs) and focus on individualized, dynamic, and adaptable portfolios of EPAs that, at any moment, reflect current competence and preparedness for disasters. At the regulatory and societal macro level, should conditions for licensing be reconsidered? Should rules of liability be adapted to match the need for rapid redeployment? We do not propose a blueprint for the future of medical training but rather aim to provoke discussions needed to build a workforce that is competent to cope with future health care crises.","Ten Cate, Olle; Schultz, Karen; Frank, Jason R; Hennus, Marije P; Ross, Shelley; Schumacher, Daniel J; Snell, Linda S; Whelan, Alison J; Young, John Q",Medical teacher,231,1

Herein, we applied qPCR, high-throughput sequencing of the genes encoding 16S and ITS rRNA to render the bacterial/fungal dynamics of ambient PM2.5 filters maintained at constant conditions of temperature (20 ± 2 °C) and humidity (50 ± 5%). The incubation experiments which lasted for 50 days aim to simulate a metabolic process of microbe in two types PM2.5 (polluted and non-polluted). The results show that microbial community species in polluted PM2.5 had faster decay rates, more bacterial diversity and less fungal community compared to the non-polluted ones. For bacteria, the proportion of anaerobic species is higher than aerobic ones, and their performance of contain mobile elements, form-biofilms, and pathogenic risks declined rapidly as times went by. Whereas for fungi, saprotroph species occupied about 70% of the population, resulting in a specified peak of abundance due to the adequacy nutrients supplied by the apoptosis cells. Combining the classified microbial species, we found stable community structure and the volatile ones related to the various metabolic survival strategies during different time. Without the input of peripheral environment, the health risks of airborne microbe descend to a healthy level after 20 days, implying their biologic effectiveness was about 20 days no matter the air is polluted or not. This study provided new insights into the different metabolic survival of airborne microorganisms in ideal and stable conditions.","Xu, Caihong; Chen, Hui; Liu, Zhe; Sui, Guodong; Li, Dan; Kan, Haidong; Zhao, Zhuohui; Hu, Wei; Chen, Jianmin",Environment international,231,1

Total body skin examination by a physician, especially a dermatologist, is the gold standard for detecting suspicious lesions that may require further evaluation. Non-medical professionals (NMPs) including massage therapists, estheticians, hairdressers, and cosmetologists have the unique opportunity to frequently examine their client's skin outside of a clinical setting. By evaluating their knowledge of and comfort with evaluation of suspicious lesions, multiple studies have gauged the utility of patient encounters with NMPs for skin cancer detection. Several studies have also focused on assessment of intervention strategies for assessing and improving NMPs ability to detect suspicious lesions and to refer for physician evaluation when necessary. A narrative literature review identified 16 articles evaluating the role of NMPs in identification of suspicious lesions on client skin. A total of 8 cross-sectional studies examined the knowledge and attitudes of NMPs toward skin evaluation, and 8 studies assessed interventional strategies for improving NMPs ability to assess skin lesions for consideration of physician referral. This review finds that NMPs are open to the idea of examining the exposed body surfaces relevant to their work with clients and are willing to refer for physician evaluation when needed. Multiple interventional strategies have demonstrated success with educating NMPs on the importance of skin surveillance and the characteristic physical exam findings associated with skin cancers. Strengthening the readiness of NMPs to examine their client's skin offers an opportunity to reduce time to skin cancer diagnosis, improve patient outcomes, and lower healthcare-associated costs of skin cancer treatment.","Pearlman, Ross L; Wilkerson, Amanda H; Ferris, Taylor S; Griffin, David B; Cobb, Emily K; McCowan, Hannah K; Bhattacharya, Kaustuv; Leo, Jonathan T; Melton, Sheree C; Nahar, Vinayak K",Journal of cosmetic dermatology,231,7

Antimicrobial prophylaxis and pre-emptive therapy have improved survival of these patients; however, the failure rates of prophylaxis are not negligible. The aim of this systematic review is to explore the reasons behind failure of antimicrobial prophylaxis and pre-emptive therapy. SETTING This systematic review included prospective randomised controlled trials and prospective single-arm studies. PARTICIPANTS The studies included were on prophylaxis and pre-emptive therapy of opportunistic infections in transplant recipients. Studies were included from databases MEDLINE, CENTRAL and Embase published until October first 2018. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES Primary outcome measures were breakthrough infections, adverse events leading to stopping of treatment, switching medication or dose reduction. Secondary outcome measures were acquired resistance to antimicrobials, antifungals or antivirals and death. RESULTS From 3317 identified records, 30 records from 24 studies with 2851 patients were included in the systematic review. Seventeen focused on prophylactic and pre-emptive treatment of cytomegalovirus and seven studies on invasive fungal infection. The main reasons for failure of prophylaxis and pre-emptive therapy were adverse events and breakthrough infections, which were described in 54% (13 studies) and 38% (9 studies) of the included studies, respectively. In 25%, six of the studies, a detailed description of patients who experienced failure of prophylaxis or pre-emptive therapy was unclear or lacking. CONCLUSIONS Our results show that although failure is reported in the studies, the level of detail prohibits a detailed analysis of failure of prophylaxis and pre-emptive therapy. Clearly reporting on patients with a negative outcome should be improved. We have provided guidance on how to detect failure early in a clinical setting in accordance to the results from this systematic review.

One idea that has garnered considerable attention, particularly on social media and in free open access medicine is the notion that lung injury due to COVID-19 is more similar to high altitude pulmonary edema (HAPE). Drawing on this concept, it has also been proposed that treatments typically employed in the management of HAPE and other forms of acute altitude illness, pulmonary vasodilators and acetazolamide, should be considered for COVID-19. Despite some similarities in clinical features between the two entities, such as hypoxemia, radiographic opacities and altered lung compliance, the pathophysiological mechanisms of HAPE and lung injury due to COVID-19 are fundamentally different and the entities cannot be viewed as equivalent. While of high utility in the management of HAPE and acute mountain sickness, systemically delivered pulmonary vasodilators and acetazolamide should not be used in the treatment of COVID-19, as they carry the risk of multiple adverse consequences including worsened ventilation-perfusion matching, impaired carbon dioxide transport, systemic hypotension and increased work of breathing.","Luks, Andrew M; Swenson, Erik R",Annals of the American Thoracic Society,231,1

However, there are concerns about the large increase in number of women who would be diagnosed with GDM using these criteria and the subsequent impact on health care resources and the individual. This Perspective reviews the origins of the IADPSG consensus and points out some of its less well-known limitations, particularly with respect to identifying women at risk for an adverse pregnancy outcome. It also questions the clinical and cost-effectiveness data often cited to support the IADPSG glycemic thresholds. We present the argument that adoption of diagnostic criteria defining GDM should be based on response to treatment at different diagnostic thresholds of maternal glycemia.

A classical electroless metallic replication method was used with a single poly(ethylene-imine) PEI layer coating the negatively charged NHLC nanotubes. Short copper rods (external diameter ∼ 80 nm) were observed by scanning electron microscopy that corresponded to the original organic templates. The results obtained in acidic conditions are analyzed in terms of the lifetime of the self-assembled structures and formation of bundles of tubes. Dynamic light scattering measurements and optical observations show that the system in the presence of controlled amounts of hydrochloric acid is stable enough to account for a metallic replication in acidic conditions. An average apparent diffusion coefficient of the organic NHLC assemblies is extracted (∼ 9.8 × 10 nm s) in homogeneous suspensions where bundles have been dispersed by the acidic additions.,"Terech, Pierre; Sangeetha, Neralagatta M; Bhat, Shreedhar; Allegraud, Jean-Jacques; Buhler, Eric",Soft matter,231,19

Both methods are promising tools to unravel the underlying pathophysiology of glomerular diseases. This review provides an overview of the technical challenges that should be addressed when designing single-cell transcriptomics experiments that focus on glomerulopathies. The isolation of glomerular cells from core needle biopsies for single-cell transcriptomics remains difficult and depends upon five major factors. First, core needle biopsies generate little tissue material and several samples are required to identify glomerular cells. Second, both fresh and frozen tissue samples may yield glomerular cells, although every experimental pipeline has different (dis)advantages. Third, enrichment for glomerular cells in human tissue prior to single-cell analysis is challenging as no effective standardized pipelines are available. Fourth, the current warm cell dissociation protocols may damage glomerular cells and induce transcriptional artefacts, which can be minimized by using cold dissociation techniques at a cost of less efficient cell dissociation. Finally, snRNA-seq methods may be superior to scRNA-seq in isolating glomerular cells, although its efficacy on core needle biopsies remains to be proven. The field of single-cell omics is rapidly evolving and the integration of these techniques in multi-omics assays will undoubtedly create new insights in the complex pathophysiology of glomerular diseases.","Deleersnijder, Dries; Callemeyn, Jasper; Arijs, Ingrid; Naesens, Maarten; Van Craenenbroeck, Amaryllis; Lambrechts, Diether; Sprangers, Ben",Journal of the American Society of Nephrology : JASN,231,24

However, it was not investigated among patients with spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). This study aimed to investigate the impact of CRP/albumin ratio on intra-hospital mortality in patients with ICH. PATIENTS AND METHODS This retrospective study was conducted on 379 ICH patients admitted between 02/2008 and 12/2017. Blood samples were drawn upon admission and the patients' demographic, medical, and radiological data were collected. The identification of the independent prognostic factors for intra-hospital mortality was calculated using binary logistic regression and COX regression analysis. RESULTS Multivariate regression analysis shows that higher CRP/albumin ratio (odds ratio (OR) = 1.66, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.193-2.317, p = 0.003) upon admission is an independent predictor of intra-hospital mortality. Multivariate Cox regression analysis indicated that an increase of 1 in the CRP/albumin ratio was associated with a 15.3% increase in the risk of intra-hospital mortality (hazard ratio = 1.153, 95% CI = 1.005-1.322, p = 0.42). Furthermore, a CRP/albumin ratio cut-off value greater than 1.22 was associated with increased intra-hospital mortality (Youden's Index = 0.19, sensitivity = 28.8, specificity = 89.9, p = 0.007).

In this study, we examine whether depressed patients with higher neuroticism scores, a marker of personality dysfunction, show differences versus depressed patients with lower scores in the functioning of two brain regions associated with treatment response, the anterior cingulate and anterior insula cortices. METHODS Functional magnetic resonance imaging data during an emotional Stroop task were collected from 135 adults diagnosed with major depressive disorder at four academic medical centers participating in the Establishing Moderators and Biosignatures of Antidepressant Response for Clinical Care (EMBARC) study. Secondary analyses were conducted including a sample of 28 healthy individuals. RESULTS In whole-brain analyses, higher neuroticism among depressed adults was associated with increased activity in and connectivity with the right anterior insula cortex to incongruent compared to congruent emotional stimuli (ks>281, ps<0.05 FWE corrected), covarying for concurrent psychiatric distress. We also observed an unanticipated relationship between neuroticism and reduced activity in the precuneus (k=269, p<0.05 FWE corrected). Exploratory analyses including healthy individuals suggested that associations between neuroticism and brain function may be nonlinear over the full range of neuroticism scores. CONCLUSIONS This study provides convergent evidence for the importance of the right anterior insula cortex as a brain-based marker of clinically meaningful individual differences in neuroticism among adults with depression. This is a critical next step in linking personality dysfunction, a replicated clinical predictor of differential antidepressant treatment response, with differences in underlying brain function.","Fournier, Jay C; Chase, Henry W; Greenberg, Tsafrir; Etkin, Amit; Almeida, Jorge R; Stiffler, Richelle; Deckersbach, Thilo; Weyandt, Sarah; Cooper, Crystal; Toups, Marisa; Carmody, Tom; Kurian, Benji; Peltier, Scott; Adams, Phillip; McInnis, Melvin G; Oquendo, Maria A; McGrath, Patrick J; Fava, Maurizio; Weissman, Myrna; Parsey, Ramin; Trivedi, Madhukar H; Phillips, Mary L",Biological psychiatry.

This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to quantify the weighted prevalence of CD among patients with TS and determine the weighted strength of association between TS and CD. Methods: Studies published between January 1991 and December 2019 were retrieved from four electronic databases: PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and Embase. Eligible studies were identified and relevant data were extracted by two independent reviewers following specific eligibility criteria and a data extraction plan. Using the random-effects model, the pooled, overall and subgroup CD prevalence rates were determined, and sources of heterogeneity were investigated using meta-regression. Results: Among a total of 1,116 screened citations, 36 eligible studies were included in the quantitative synthesis. Nearly two-thirds of the studies (61.1%) were from European countries. Of the 6,291 patients with TS who were tested for CD, 241 were diagnosed with CD, with a crude CD prevalence of 3.8%. The highest and lowest CD prevalence rates of 20.0 and 0.0% were reported in Sweden and Germany, respectively. The estimated overall weighted CD prevalence was 4.5% (95% confidence interval [CI], 3.3-5.9, I 2, 67.4%). The weighted serology-based CD prevalence in patients with TS (3.4%, 95% CI, 1.0-6.6) was similar to the weighted biopsy-based CD prevalence (4.8%; 95% CI, 3.4-6.5). The strength of association between TS and CD was estimated in only four studies (odds ratio 18.1, 95% CI, 1.82-180; odds ratio 4.34, 95% CI, 1.48-12.75; rate ratio 14, 95% CI, 1.48-12.75; rate ratio 42.5, 95% CI, 12.4-144.8). Given the lack of uniformity in the type of reported measures of association and study design, producing a weighted effect measure to evaluate the strength of association between TS and CD was unfeasible. Conclusion: Nearly 1 in every 22 patients with TS had CD. Regular screening for CD in patients with TS might facilitate early diagnosis and therapeutic management to prevent adverse effects of CD such as being underweight and osteoporosis.","Al-Bluwi, Ghada S M; AlNababteh, Asma H; Östlundh, Linda; Al-Shamsi, Saif; Al-Rifai, Rami H",Frontiers in medicine,231,1

Laparotomy and laparoscopic surgery are current standard treatments; however, the laparoendoscopic single-site (LESS) approach offers many potential benefits. We describe our technique for LESS biopsy of RTUO. PATIENTS AND METHODS Five patients underwent LESS biopsy for diagnosis of RTUO. A multichannel port was inserted into the peritoneal or retroperitoneal space through a 3-cm skin incision, which adequately exposed the retroperitoneal tumor. The specimen was grasped and isolated circumferentially from the surrounding tissue. RESULTS LESS surgery was performed successfully without any complications such as open conversion. Mean operative time was 183 min and estimated blood loss was negligible. The diagnoses were IgG4-related retroperitoneal fibrosis (n = 4) and lymphoma (n = 1). Sufficient specimens were safely obtained not only for pathological diagnosis but also for further examinations such as immunophenotyping or DNA analysis. Convalescence was satisfactory. All patients were treated appropriately according to the resulting diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS LESS biopsy for RTUO is a safe and effective alternative to open surgical and standard laparoscopic biopsies. Further studies of clinical experiences are needed to confirm the benefits of this new technique.","Nozaki, Tetsuo; Iida, Hiroaki; Morii, Akihiro; Fujiuchi, Yasuyoshi; Komiya, Akira; Fuse, Hideki",Urologia internationalis,231,1

Additionally, we evaluated whether perceived vulnerability to COVID among cancer survivors predicts their cognitive/affective and behavioral responses to the pandemic. DESIGN/SAMPLE Cancer survivors who completed primary cancer treatment (median months since treatment = 33.00) and were enrolled in prior behavioral trials with our research team (N = 146) completed two surveys in May-July 2020 (95.89% retention). METHODS Participants rated perceived next-year risk of infection and of dying from COVID. We adapted established scales to assess perceived vulnerability to COVID generally versus as a cancer survivor, catastrophizing about possible COVID symptoms, COVID-related contamination fears, and adherence to COVID prevention behaviors. FINDINGS In May 2020, on a 1-100 scale with 0 = no chance and 100 = definitely will occur, cancer survivors reported a chance in the next year of contracting COVID of M = 39.94 (SD = 23.90), and dying from COVID of M = 24.46 (SD = 24.84). Cancer survivors reported somewhat greater vulnerability to COVID compared to same-aged peers, increased contamination fears, and high adherence to COVID prevention measures. Similar findings emerged six weeks later, suggesting stability over time. In simple linear regression models, both general and cancer survivor-specific perceived COVID vulnerability predicted COVID symptom catastrophizing and contamination fears; in multivariable models, only general vulnerability remained a significant predictor. General perceived vulnerability and contamination fears predicted greater adherence to COVID prevention behaviors. CONCLUSIONS Cancer survivors perceived elevated vulnerability to COVID even years after treatment, which predicted adherence to COVID prevention behaviors. Future research should identify the optimal balance between supporting cancer survivors' concerns and minimizing negative impacts on quality of life.","Slivjak, Elizabeth T; Fishbein, Joel N; Nealis, Madeline; Schmiege, Sarah J; Arch, Joanna J",Journal of psychosocial oncology,231,1

Angiogenesis strongly correlates with aneurysm accumulation. Stent-jack causes higher mechanical forces in cerebral vessels than stent-jailing. Mechanical forces, as well as TGF-β/Smad2,3,4 signaling pathway, may play an important factor in IA recurrence by affecting angiogenesis. Methods: We explored the effects of stent-jailing or stent-jack technique on IA recurrence by investigating mechanical forces, TGF-β/Smad2,3,4 signaling pathway and the incidence of angiogenesis in IA patients. One-hundred-eighty-one IA patients were assigned into stent-jailing (n = 93) and stent-jacket groups (n = 88). The clinical outcome was evaluated using Glasgow Outcome Score (GOS) and aneurysm occlusion grades. The percentage of CD34+EPCs (releasing pro-angiogenic cytokines) in peripheral blood was measured by flow cytometer. Endothelial cells were separated from cerebral aneurysm and malformed arteries via immunomagnetic cell sorting. Angiogenesis was measured by microvessel density (MVD) using anti-CD34 monoclonal antibody staining before using the stent, immediately after surgery and 2 years later. Meanwhile, the mechanical forces in cerebral vessels were determined by measuring endothelial shear stress (ESS) via a computational method. TGF-β and Smad2,3,4 were measured by real-time qPCR and Western Blot. Tube formation analysis was performed to test the relationship between angiogenesis and TGF-β, and the effects of different techniques on angiogenesis. Results: After a 2-year follow-up, 85 and 81 patients from stent-jailing and stent-jack groups, respectively, completed the experiment. Stent-jailing technique improved GOS and reduced aneurysm occlusion grades higher than the stent-jack technique (P < 0.05). The counts of CD34+EPCs and MVD values in the stent-jailing group were lower than the stent-jack group (P < 0.05). ESS values in sent-jailing group were lower than the stent-jack group (P < 0.05), and positively correlated with MVD values (P < 0.05). TGF-β and Smad2,3,4 levels in sent-jailing group were also lower than the stent-jack group (P < 0.05). TGF-β was associated with angiogenesis incidence and stent-jack caused angiogenesis incidence more than stent-jailing. Conclusion: Stent-jailing technique reduces IA recurrence more than stent-jack by causing less mechanical forces, angiogenesis and inhibiting TGF-β/Smad2,3,4 signaling in IA patients.","Xu, Ning; Meng, Hao; Liu, Tianyi; Feng, Yingli; Qi, Yuan; Zhang, Donghuan; Wang, Honglei",Frontiers in physiology,231,1

The prototypical endovascular neural interface is the StentrodeTM, a stent-electrode array which can be implanted into the superior sagittal sinus via percutaneous catheter venography, and transmits signals through a transvenous lead to a receiver located subcutaneously in the chest. Whilst the StentrodeTM has been conceptually validated in ovine models, questions remain about the long term viability and safety of this device in human recipients. Although technical precedence for venous sinus stenting already exists in the setting of idiopathic intracranial hypertension, long term implantation of a lead within the intracranial veins has never been previously achieved. Contrastingly, transvenous leads have been successfully employed for decades in the setting of implantable cardiac pacemakers and defibrillators. In the current absence of human data on the StentrodeTM, the literature on these structurally comparable devices provides valuable lessons that can be translated to the setting of endovascular neuromodulation. This review will explore this literature in order to understand the potential risks of the StentrodeTM and define avenues where further research and development are necessary in order to optimize this device for human application.","Raza, Samad A; Opie, Nicholas L; Morokoff, Andrew; Sharma, Rahul P; Mitchell, Peter J; Oxley, Thomas J",Frontiers in neurology,231,1

However, the effectiveness of Fe-based biochar to immobilize As in paddy soils under varying redox conditions (Eh) has not been quantified. We tested the capability of the raw (RBC) and Fe-impregnated (FeBC) biochars to immobilize As in a paddy soil under various Eh conditions (from -400 to +300 mV) using a biogeochemical microcosm system. In the control, As was mobilized (686.2-1535.8 μg L-1) under reducing conditions and immobilized (61.6-71.1 μg L-1) under oxidizing conditions. Application of FeBC immobilized As at Eh < 0 mV by 32.6%-81.1%, compared to the control, because of the transformation of As-bound Fe (hydro)oxides (e.g., ferrihydrite) and the formation of complexes (e.g., ternary As-Fe-DOC). Application of RBC immobilized As at Eh < -100 mV by 16.0%-41.3%, compared to the control, due to its porous structure and oxygen-containing functional groups. Mobilized As at Eh > +200 mV was caused by the increase of pH after RBC application. Amendment of the Fe-modified biochar can be a suitable approach for alleviating the environmental risk of As under reducing conditions in paddy soils.","Yang, Xing; Shaheen, Sabry M; Wang, Jianxu; Hou, Deyi; Ok, Yong Sik; Wang, Shan-Li; Wang, Hailong; Rinklebe, Jörg",Journal of hazardous materials,231,28

Research has highlighted advantages and disadvantages of each of these medications, but there remains an absence of qualitative evidence regarding the lived experiences of AF patients. The present study helps address this gap and obtain a greater understanding of the patient experience and beliefs surrounding their anticoagulant medication. METHOD Semi-structured qualitative interviews with a purposive sample of 20 participants (10 warfarin, 10 rivaroxaban). Interviews were transcribed verbatim and thematically analysed. RESULTS Data analysis led to the generation of three key themes: positive perceptions of medication, distrust of alternatives, and inconsistencies in support experiences. CONCLUSIONS Positive perceptions of one anticoagulant medication (ACM) and distrust of alternatives may influence patients' confidence in switching medications. This is potentially problematic where there is a lack of patient engagement in medication changes, as seen during the COVID pandemic. Gaps in patient understanding of anticoagulation, including lack of clarity around medications selection and misconceptions about treatment, were evident. By addressing these misconceptions, clinicians may be better positioned to support people with AF in self-management of their ACM.","Sly, Dan; Husted, Margaret; McKeague, Lynn; Everington, Tamara",Journal of evaluation in clinical practice,231,20

Methods We conducted a surveillance study for CAP in 30 hospitals of Beijing. Epidemiological data and clinical specimens were systematically collected from enrolled CAP patients. The detection for 11 atypical pathogens [9 respiratory viruses, Mycoplasma pneumoniae (MP) and Chlamydophila pneumoniae (CP)] was performed. Risk factors of severe CAP and death in Hospital were evaluated. Results A total of 6,008 CAP patients [including 1,071 severe CAP (SCAP)] were enrolled. The overall detection rate of the 11 atypical pathogens was 42.4% among 1,925 child CAP (39.9% among 274 child SCAP), and 25.8% among 4,083 adult CAP (22.8% among 797 adult SCAP). The most frequent atypical pathogen among child SCAP was parainfluenza virus (10.2%) followed by respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) (8.4%). However, the most frequent atypical pathogen among adult SCAP was influenza virus (8.9%) followed by parainfluenza virus (3.8%). Multivariate analyses showed that the important predictors for SCAP were an age ≤9 years, an age ≥65 years and co-existing diseases. These factors, except an age ≤9 years, were also predictors of death in Hospital. None of these 11 atypical pathogens was included as the risk factors of SCAP or death in Hospital. Conclusions Although these 11 atypical pathogens were the common causes of CAP (including SCAP) among Chinese, they were not observed to increase risks for SCAP or death in Hospital.","Gong, Cheng; Zhang, Tiegang; Luo, Ming; Li, Aihua; Dong, Mei; Li, Maozhong; Wang, Yiting; Huang, Fang",Journal of thoracic disease,231,12

The development of animal models of cSCI will aid in the pre-clinical assessment of therapies and in understanding basic pathophysiological mechanisms. Here, we describe a clinically relevant model of cervical contusion-compression injury in the mouse. Using a modified aneurysm clip, we generated a bilateral, incomplete injury that mimics contusion-compression injuries most commonly observed in humans. We followed the recovery of injured and sham-operated (laminectomy-only) animals for 8 weeks post-surgery. Behavioral tests, including the Basso Mouse Scale (BMS), wire hanging, grip strength, and CatWalk automated gait analysis, showed that while natural recovery is limited, it occurs in a clinically relevant window during the subacute phase of injury (7-14 days post-SCI). BMS scoring demonstrated that, while injured animals are ambulatory, they do not recover normal locomotor ability. CatWalk analysis quantitatively showed a loss of coordination and motor ability, with minimal recovery. The wire hanging and grip strength tests confirmed a significant decrease in forelimb motor strength in injured animals. Histological analysis carried out during the subacute phase (7-day time point) and chronic phase (8-week time point) demonstrated that the lesion epicenter is formed by 7 days post-SCI. Volumetric analysis of protein kinase C gamma (PKCgamma)-stained axons revealed that this injury results in significant damage to the corticospinal tract caudal to the injury site. Finally, we used quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction to show that genes associated with inflammation and glial scarring are upregulated as a result of injury. This study confirms that we can effectively model bilateral cervical injury in the mouse and provides a framework for future studies using this model to assess therapies.","Forgione, Nicole; Chamankhah, Mahmood; Fehlings, Michael G",Journal of neurotrauma,231,1

Transfer of the ATP γ phosphate to a protein tyrosine residue activates signaling cascades regulating the differentiation, survival, and effector functions of all cells, with unique roles in immune antigen receptor, polarization, and other signaling pathways. Defining the substrates and scaffolding interactions of tyrosine kinases is critical for revealing and therapeutically manipulating mechanisms of immune regulation. Quantitative analysis of the amplitude and kinetics of these effects is becoming ever more accessible experimentally and increasingly important for predicting complex downstream effects of therapeutics and for building computational models. Secondarily, quantitative analysis is increasingly expected by reviewers and journal editors, and statistical analysis of biological replicates can bolster claims of experimental rigor and reproducibility. Here we outline methods for perturbing tyrosine kinase activity in cells and quantifying protein phosphorylation in lysates and immunoprecipitates. The immunoblotting techniques are a guide to probing the dynamics of protein abundance, protein-protein interactions, and changes in post-translational modification. Immunoprecipitated protein complexes can also be subjected to targeted mass spectrometry to probe novel sites of modification and multiply modified or understudied proteins that cannot be resolved by immunoblotting. Together, these protocols form a framework for identifying the unique contributions of tyrosine kinases to cell activation and elucidating the mechanisms governing immune cell regulation in health and disease. © 2020 The Authors.

However, its full potential remains unclear and clinical comparative studies hardly exist. The aim of this study was to prospectively evaluate our experience with CALS for performing retroperitoneal nephrectomies in children when compared with controls undergoing open surgery in terms of safety, operative time, blood loss, opoid requirements, the duration of hospital stay and complications. CHILDREN AND METHODS Computer-assisted retroperitoneoscopic nephrectomy was undertaken in ten consecutive children, mean age at the time of surgery 6.4 (SD ± 4.5) years, and compared with a retrospectively collected control group of all other children, mean age 3.9 (SD ± 4.6) years, who underwent the same procedure by conventional open surgery between the years 2005 and 2009. The endpoint of the study was 1 month postoperatively. RESULTS Nephrectomies were performed in all the children and no child was excluded from the study. There was no per-operative complication in any of the groups. The median (range) operative time was 202 (128-325) and 72 (44-160) min for the CALS and open group, respectively. The blood loss was minimal (<20 ml) for all the patients. The postoperative opoid requirements did not differ. The median (range) postoperative hospital stay was 1 (1-4) and 2 (1-7) days for the CALS and the open group, respectively. One complication in the form of an urinoma appeared 5 days after surgery in the CALS group. CONCLUSION Computer-assisted retroperitoneoscopic nephrectomy is a safe, feasible and effective procedure in children. Even though operative times are longer the patients benefit from the lower morbidity, improved cosmetics and shorter hospitalization associated with the minimally invasive approach.","Anderberg, Magnus; Kockum, Christina Clementson; Arnbjörnsson, Einar",Pediatric surgery international,231,1

Determination of clinical predictors for poor QoL may support consultation of respective patients. This study explores QoL of patients with olfactory dysfunction and evaluates associated clinical risk factors for QoL prediction. METHODS One hundred eight patients suffering from chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) and allergic rhinitis (AR) and 30 healthy subjects were studied. Olfactory function was evaluated using objective olfactory test. All patients completed six validated questionnaires either specific for olfaction (Questionnaire of Olfactory Deficits [QOD]) and for assessing psychological state (Zung Anxiety Scale [ZAS], State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, Zung Depression Scale, and Beck Depression Inventory [BDI]) or a generic one (Short Form 36). RESULTS Significantly poorer QoL and more severe anxiety and depression symptoms were observed in anosmic (all p < 0.001) and hyposmic patients compared with controls. Anosmic patients presented significantly worse results compared with hyposmic and normosmic patients. However, higher scores were observed in hyposmic compared with normosmic patients only in the QOD, ZAS, and BDI scale. Patients with CRS presented significantly poorer QoL than patients with AR only. The presence of nasal polyps or concomitant AR in patients with CRS did not show any differentiation in the results. Asthma was associated with significantly worse scores in all the psychometric questionnaires. CONCLUSION Olfactory dysfunction was found to decrease QoL among patients. Anosmia, CRS disease, and asthma as clinical predictors were proved to be independently correlated with QoL, anxiety, and depression levels.","Katotomichelakis, Michael; Simopoulos, Efthimios; Zhang, Nan; Tripsianis, Gregory; Danielides, Gerasimos; Livaditis, Miltos; Bachert, Claus; Danielides, Vassilios",American journal of rhinology & allergy,231,16

In dengue, nonneutralizing antibodies raised by natural infection with one of four dengue viruses (DENVs) may enhance infection with a different virus by a process we term ""intrinsic antibody-dependent enhancement"" (iADE). In addition, nonprotective antibodies raised by formalin-inactivated respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and measles virus vaccines have led to enhanced disease during breakthrough infections. Infections under iADE conditions not only facilitate the process of viral entry into monocytes and macrophages but also modify innate and adaptive intracellular antiviral mechanisms, suppressing type 1 interferon (IFN) production and resulting in enhanced DENV replication. The suppression observed in vitro has been documented in patients with severe (dengue hemorrhagic fever [DHF]) but not in patient with mild (dengue fever [DF]) secondary dengue virus infections. Important veterinary viral infections also may exhibit iADE. It is thought that use of formalin deconforms viral epitopes of RSV, resulting in poor Toll-like receptor (TLR) stimulation; suboptimal maturation of dendritic cells with reduced production of activation factors CD40, CD80, and CD86; decreased germinal center formation in lymph nodes; and the production of nonprotective antibodies. These antibodies fail to neutralize RSV, allowing replication with secondary stimulation of RSV-primed Th2 cells producing more low-avidity antibody, resulting in immune complexes deposited into affected tissue. However, when formalin-inactivated RSV was administered with a TLR agonist to mice, they were protected against wild-type virus challenge. Safe and effective vaccines against RSV/measles virus and dengue virus may benefit from a better understanding of how innate immune responses can promote production of protective antibodies.","Ubol, Sukathida; Halstead, Scott B",Clinical and vaccine immunology : CVI,231,7

Immediate thoracotomy for penetrating trauma to the heart and chest has resulted in the decreased use of PCC in trauma. PCC is now offered as an optional skill in the ninth edition of the ATLS®. A review of the literature regarding the use and effectiveness of PCC in traumatic pericardial tamponade in the modern era is necessary to better define its current role in trauma care. METHODS Scientific publications from 1970 to 2010 involving PCC after trauma were identified. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses was used. Human studies describing acute traumatic tamponade were included. Publications involving nontraumatic or chronic pericardial tamponade from effusions caused by inflammatory, infectious, or neoplastic etiology were excluded. Publications were categorized by level of evidence. RESULTS Of the 135 publications identified, 27 were included, composing of 2,094 trauma patients with suspected cardiac tamponade. The reported use of PCC decreased from 45.9% of patients in the period 1970 to 1979 down to 6.4% of patients in the period between 2000 and 2010 (p < 0.05). Reported rates describing the use of PCC as the sole intervention decreased from 13.7% in the period 1970 to 1979 to 2.1% in the period 2000 to 2010 (p < 0.05). Survival analysis after PCC was possible for 380 patients. Overall survival following PCC was 83.4% (n = 317) and 91.8% (n = 145) when used as the sole intervention. In patients who received PCC then thoracotomy, survival rate was 79.5% (n = 178). CONCLUSION Studies on the use of PCC for trauma are limited and biased toward survivors. The reported survival rate is high. There remains a limited role for PCC in nontrauma centers where definitive surgical management is not immediately available and transport time to a higher level of care facility supports the use of temporary decompression by PCC.

Therefore, we reviewed the correlations and differences between invading mechanisms and resultant urogenital system damages by three kinds of coronaviruses mentioned above, expecting to help doctors preventing and treating the damages in the urogenital system which is of significance in improving prognosis and quality of life after rehabilitation. MATERIALS AND METHODS We searched PubMed for English language articles published since 2003 with the key words ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19),"" ""severe acute respiratory syndrome-2 (SARS-CoV-2),"" ""severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV"" and ""Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)-CoV""with ""semen"" and ""kidney"" We also used relevant data from websites including the World Health organization and Centers for disease control and prevention. RESULTS Recent studies have revealed that both SARS CoV and SARS-CoV-2 invade target cells through a membrane-bound angiotensin-convert enzyme 2 (ACE2), an important component of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) which maintains human homeostasis, whereas MERS utilizes host cells' receptor dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) for entry. While pneumonia is the most prominent symptom in patients infected by coronaviruses due to their transmission through respiratory droplets, urogenital system can also suffer from the infection of coronaviruses, resulting renal failure and testicular atrophy and etc. The impairments of three coronavirus infection with genitourinary system would be different, but they still have a strong correlation. CONCLUSIONS The pathogenesis and clinical symptoms of SARS-COV, MERS-COV and SARS-COV-2 coronaviruses in the genitourinary system were comparable.

Use of new technologies such as virtual and augmented reality are currently under investigation for their potential to provide exciting and engaging activities for older people in residential aged care facilities. However, there is limited evidence on whether these technologies can promote physical activity in a small group setting for people with cognitive impairment. Using mixed methods, we examined the use of a virtual cycling experience in a sample of 10 participants with cognitive impairment living in residential aged care facilities. In a randomised crossover design, participants engaged in a 25-minute, self-paced, facilitated seated virtual cycling experience and a time-matched seated physical activity session in groups of five. All participants completed a brief pre- and post-intervention mood questionnaire. Video analysis was used for both conditions to compare levels of environmental stimulation, apathy and engagement using both the Person-Environment Apathy Rating Scale and the Engagement of a Person with Dementia Scale. A thematic analysis of semi-structured interviews following the virtual cycling experience was also performed. No differences were observed between conditions for all outcomes except for environmental stimulation, where there was a lower response in the intervention than the control condition (p = 0.032). This was primarily driven by lower scores for the virtual cycling experience than control in physical accessibility (p = 0.012). Participants reported the virtual cycling experience to be immersive and challenging and reminisced about cycling earlier in life. The activity manager observed that the virtual cycling experience was an overall positive experience and emphasised benefits of safety screening and preparation prior to the activities. The findings of this study support the use of the virtual cycling experience as an immersive and engaging alternative to usual activities, which might encourage higher levels of physical activity in residential aged care facilities.","D'Cunha, Nathan M; Isbel, Stephen T; Frost, Jane; Fearon, Angie; McKune, Andrew J; Naumovski, Nenad; Kellett, Jane",Dementia,231,1

Greater understanding is required concerning the types of access actually used by families in poverty in attempts to meet their basic needs. Poverty must be addressed based on the question: ""Inequality of what?"" It is in reflecting on the realities of such groups when their basic needs are not met that public policies can be improved and implemented with legitimate priorities. OBJECTIVE Describe coverage and access to public health, education and social assistance services and the related effects on the quality of life of families in extreme poverty. METHODS An exploratory mixed methods study was conducted applying Amartya Sen's ""Basic Capability Equality"" framework, with: 1) 27 interviews with managers and professionals from public services serving territories with extreme poverty; 2) Survey with a systematic proportionate stratified sample of 336 heads of households in extreme poverty from a total 2605 families. The resulting data was analyzed with thematic content analysis and descriptive statistics, respectively. RESULTS The managers and professionals described the lives of families in extreme poverty with phrases such as, ""These people suffer. Sadness weighs on their lives!"" and ""Depression is the most common illness"". Their precarious circumstances and inadequate access were cited as causes. Quality of life was considered bad or very bad by 41.4% of heads of households. A total income of less than one-third of the minimum wage was received by 56.9% of the sample. One or more people were unemployed in the family in 55.8% of cases. For 53.3% of heads of households, public services ""did not meet any or few of their needs"". The main social determinants of health were described as: alcohol and drugs (68.8%); lack of good health care (60.7%); and absence of income/work (37.5%). The following were identified as solutions to improve their quality of life: (1) health (40.5%); (2) education (37.8%); and (3) employment (44.6%). CONCLUSIONS The social determinants of poverty and health must be addressed jointly through intersectoral public policies and egalitarian mechanisms that promote investment in social protection.","de França, Viviane Helena; Modena, Celina Maria; Confalonieri, Ulisses Eugenio Cavalcanti",International journal for equity in health,231,1

The population is the manufacturer domiciled in East Java, Indonesia, which has implemented ERP and been certified by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) in the environmental management system. Data collection used a questionnaire designed with the five-point Likert scale. Of 243 manufacturers, 150 questionnaires were distributed, and 135 questionnaires are considered valid for analysis. Data analysis used smart PLS software. The result indicated that all eight predetermined hypotheses were supported. Enhanced ERP affects supplier integration, internal integration, and green supply chain management. Internal integration affects green supply chain management and firm performance. Supplier integration affects green supply chain management and firm performance. Green supply chain management affects firm performance. An interesting finding is that green supply chain management, internal integration, and supplier integration mediate the effect of enhanced ERP on firm performance. This study’s novelty lies in the research model that analyzes the relationship between the four constructs simultaneously with the green supply chain management, internal integration, and supplier integration as a mediating variable. The research provides an insight for the manager on how to improve the firm performance in supply chain management.

This study aimed to provide epidemiologic and clinical characteristics of patients with confirmed COVID-19 in Saudi Arabia and to determine whether characteristic profiles differ between patients who are symptomatic vs. asymptomatic for the disease. The first 492 consecutive patients diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection at King Faisal Specialist Hospital and Research Centre in Saudi Arabia between March and September 2020 were included in this study. An electronic case report form developed using REDCap was used to collect data for each patient, including demographic characteristics, virus exposure (travel history, and human and animal contact), vaccination history, comorbidities, signs and symptoms, laboratory and radiographic reports, cardiac workup, medications, treatment regimens, and patient outcome. This patient cohort was 54% male, with 20.4% aged more than 60 years, 19.9% aged 31 to 40 years, and 17% aged 41 to 50 years. Most patients (79.2%) were symptomatic. Variables that significantly differed between symptomatic and asymptomatic patients were age, blood oxygen saturation percentage, hemoglobin level, lymphocyte count, neutrophil to lymphocyte (NTL) ratio, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) level, and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) level. Asymptomatic patients were mostly younger, with lower body mass index and ALT and AST levels but higher lymphocyte counts, NTL ratio, and CD4, CD8, natural killer cell, IgG, and IgM levels. The median incubation period reported for this cohort was 16 day, with upper and lower 95% quartiles of 27 and 10 days, respectively. Factors associated with increased risk of mortality were age (older than 42 years) and comorbidities, including specifically diabetes mellitus and hypertension. Patients who were not given an antiviral regimen were associated with better prognosis than patients who received an antiviral regimen (HR, 0.07; 95% CI, 0.011-0.25). Similar to countries worldwide, Saudi Arabia has explored treatment options to save the lives of patients during the COVID-19 pandemic.

This longitudinal study investigated the quantity and quality of SARS-CoV-2 antibody response in 846 specimens from 350 subjects: comparing BNT162b2-vaccinated individuals (19 previously diagnosed with COVID-19 [RecoVax]; 49 never been diagnosed [NaiveVax]) to 122 hospitalized unvaccinated (HospNoVax) and 160 outpatient unvaccinated (OutPtNoVax) COVID-19 patients. NaiveVax experienced a delay in generating SARS-CoV-2 total antibody levels (TAb) and neutralizing antibodies (SNAb) after the 1st vaccine dose (D1), but a rapid increase in antibody levels was observed after the 2nd dose (D2). However, these never reached the robust levels observed in RecoVax. In fact, NaiveVax TAb and SNAb levels decreased 4-weeks post-D2 (p=0.003;p<0.001). For the most part, RecoVax TAb persisted throughout this study, after reaching maximal levels 2-weeks post-D2; but SNAb decreased significantly ~6-months post-D1 (p=0.002). Although NaiveVax avidity lagged behind that of RecoVax for most of the follow-up periods, NaiveVax did reach similar avidity by ~6-months post-D1. These data suggest that one vaccine dose elicits maximal antibody response in RecoVax and may be sufficient. Also, despite decreasing levels in TAb and SNAb overtime, long-term avidity maybe a measure worth evaluating and possibly correlating to vaccine efficacy.","Racine-Brzostek, S.

Our objective was to examine patient antibody responses following COVID-19 Convalescent Plasma (CCP) transfusion and compare responses to CCP from vaccinated and nonvaccinated donors. Materials and methods: Plasma samples were obtained from 25 recipients of CCP and COVID-19 antibody levels measured before and after CCP treatment. Factors that effect antibody levels were examined. Results: In the 21 patients who received CCP from nonvaccinated donors, only modest increases in antibody levels were observed. Patients who received two units were more likely to seroconvert than those receiving just one unit. The strongest predictor of changes in patient antibody level was the CCP dose. Using patient plasma volume and donor antibody level, the post-transfusion antibody level could be predicted with remarkable accuracy. In contrast, the 4 patients who received CCP from vaccinated donors all had dramatic increases in antibody levels following transfusion of a single unit. In this subset of recipients, antibody levels observed after transfusion of CCP were comparable to those seen in donors who had fully recovered from COVID-19. Conclusion: If available, CCP from vaccinated donors with very high antibody levels should be used. CCP from vaccinated donors increases patient antibody levels much more than 1 or 2 units of CCP from unvaccinated donors.","Leon, J.; Merrill, A.; Rogers, K.; Kurt, J.; Dempewolf, S.; Ehlers, A.; Jackson, B.; Knudson, M.",,231,1

Thanks to this experience, the medication was dispensed by the hospital pharmacy through the community pharmacy of the patient's choice. Our objective was to estimate the costs avoided by this practice during the months of April and May 2020. Methods: The analysis of the economic impact was carried out in terms of saved costs, from the hospital and from the social perspective. Savings associated with the avoided home delivery of medication and avoided labor productivity losses were calculated, as well as the time associated with avoided trips in monetary terms. Results: A total of 2,249 hospital-dispensed drugs were delivered through the community pharmacy in the analyzed period, with an average of 57.7 daily deliveries. The experience, which involved one hospital and 262 pharmacies of Cantabria, saved patients 93,305 km in trips to the hospital, associated with an average time saving of 1,374 hours. In terms of costs, the hospital saved on shipments by courier, estimated at €30,205, since it was the community pharmacy and the distribution warehouses that delivered the drugs.

In the previously reported primary analysis (Dimopoulos et al, Lancet 2020), a significant progression-free survival (PFS) benefit was demonstrated in patients treated with KdD vs patients treated with Kd (hazard ratio [HR], 0.63 [95% CI, 0.46-0.85];two-sided P=0.0027). However, after a median follow-up of 16.9 months, median PFS was not reached in the KdD arm. Here, we report updated efficacy and safety outcomes from the CANDOR study. Methods: Adult patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma (RRMM) received 28-day cycles of KdD or Kd (randomized 2:1). In the primary analysis, PFS was the primary endpoint and overall survival (OS) a key secondary endpoint. In this prespecified interim OS analysis, statistical testing was based on the actual number of OS events observed by the data cutoff (approximately 36 months after enrollment of the first patient);PFS was summarized descriptively. Disease progression was determined locally by investigators in an unblinded manner and centrally by the sponsor using a validated computer algorithm (Onyx Response Computer Algorithm [ORCA]) in a blinded manner. PFS and OS were compared between the KdD and Kd arms using a stratified log-rank test, and HRs were estimated by a stratified Cox proportional-hazards model. Results: Patients were randomized to KdD (n = 312) and Kd (n = 154). Of all randomized patients, median age was approximately 64 years;42% received previous lenalidomide, and 33% were lenalidomide refractory;90% received previous bortezomib, and 29% were bortezomib refractory. At the data cutoff date of June 15, 2020, 199 (63.8%) patients in the KdD arm and 88 (57.1%) in the Kd arm remained on study. Among patients treated with KdD and Kd, 140 (44.9%) and 85 (55.2%) had PFS events, respectively;median follow-up was 27.8 months (KdD) and 27.0 months (Kd). Median PFS by ORCA was 28.6 months for the KdD arm versus 15.2 months for the Kd arm (HR, 0.59 [95% CI, 0.45-0.78];Figure). OS data were not mature and will be updated at a future prespecified analysis. Median treatment duration was 79.3 weeks with KdD versus 40.3 weeks with Kd. Grade ≥3 adverse events (AEs) occurred in 87.0% and 75.8% of patients in the KdD and Kd arms, respectively, and fatal AEs occurred in 8.8% and 4.6%;one fatal AE in the KdD arm (due to arrhythmia) and one fatal AE in the Kd arm (due to COVID-19 pneumonia) had occurred since the primary analysis. Carfilzomib treatment discontinuation rates due to AEs were 26.0% with KdD and 22.2% with Kd. Exposure-adjusted AE rates per 100 patient years were: 171.2 and 151.9 for grade ≥3 AEs and 6.9 and 5.6 for fatal AEs in the KdD and Kd arms, respectively. Updated data by key subgroups will be presented. Conclusion: With approximately 11 months of additional follow-up, a 13.4-month improvement in median PFS was observed in patients treated with KdD (28.6 months) versus patients treated with Kd (15.2 months;HR, 0.59 [95% CI, 0.45-0.78]). Safety was consistent with previously reported results. KdD continues to show a favorable benefit-risk profile and represents an efficacious treatment option for patients with RRMM.

Therefore, the existing statistical data indicated that the e-wallet adoption rate remains at a low percentage. It has been a barrier for Malaysia in achieving the aims to become a cashless country. The use of e-wallet was also expected to rise amidst the Covid-19 pandemic;to optimize an intervention for the Covid-19 outbreak. Thus, the current study investigates the factors that correlate with the intention to use e-wallet during the Covid-19 pandemic. This study is designed using a quantitative approach through cross-sectional data. A total of 160 Malaysian youths participated and collected by using an online survey. Further, the Task-Technology Fit (TTF) model and Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) were integrated into this study with an extended variable, namely, perceived credibility. The analysis results showed that Individual-Technology Fit, Task-Technology Fit, Perceived Usefulness, Perceived Ease of Use and Perceived Credibility were significantly correlated to Covid19 intra-period e-wallet adoption. In conclusion, a considerable theoretical contribution was demonstrated by integrating TTF-TAM and Perceived Credibility in a single integrated model. The constructs in the TTF model (i.e., Individual-technology fit and task-technology fit) has positively related to the constructs in the TAM model (i.e., perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use). This study is useful to stakeholders and provides enhanced directions to meet market needs by understanding and predicting e-wallet user's post-pandemic behavior, thereby helping service providers attract new users and retain their existing users. © 2021 by the authors;licensee Growing Science, Canada.","Yaakop, A.

Expression profiling and electron microscopy have frequently been used to study virus-host interactions, but these techniques do not readily enable spatial, sub-cellular and molecular analysis of specific cellular compartments. Here, we use diffraction-unlimited fluorescence microscopy to analyze how SARS-CoV-2 infection exploits and repurposes the subcellular architecture of primary human airway cells. Using STED nanoscopy, we detect viral entry factors along the motile cilia of ciliated cells and visualize key aspects of the viral life cycle. Using Tenfold Robust Expansion (TREx) microscopy, we analyze the extensively remodeled three-dimensional ultrastructure of SARS-CoV-2-infected ciliated cells and uncover Golgi fragmentation, emergence of large and atypical multivesicular bodies enclosing viral proteins, ciliary clustering, and remodeling of the apical surface. These results demonstrate a broadly applicable strategy to study how viruses reorganize host cells with spatial and molecular specificity and provide new insights into SARS-CoV-2 infection in primary human cell models.","Nijenhuis, Wilco; Damstra, Hugo G.J.; van Grinsven, Emma J.; Iwanski, Malina K.; Praest, Patrique; Soltani, Zahra E.; van Grinsven, Mariëlle M.P.; Brunsveld, Jesse E.; de Kort, Theun; Rodenburg, Lisa W.; de Jong, Dorien C.M.; Raeven, Henriette H.M.; Spelier, Sacha; Amatngalim, Gimano D.; Akhmanova, Anna; Nijhuis, Monique; Lebbink, Robert Jan; Beekman, Jeffrey M.; Kapitein, Lukas C.",bioRxiv,231,20

One of the most important signaling pathways in higher eukaryotes is the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway, which plays fundamental roles in growth, metabolism and immunity. The class IB PI3K, PI3Kγ, is a heterodimeric complex composed of a catalytic p110γ subunit bound to a p101 or p84 regulatory subunit. PI3Kγ is a critical component in multiple immune signaling processes and is dependent on activation by Ras and GPCRs to mediate its cellular roles. Here we describe the rapid and efficient characterization of multiple PI3Kγ single chain camelid nanobodies using hydrogen deuterium exchange mass spectrometry (HDX-MS) for structural and biochemical studies. This allowed us to identify nanobodies that stimulated lipid kinase activity, blocked Ras activation and specifically inhibited p101-mediated GPCR activation. Overall, this reveals novel insight into PI3Kγ regulation and identifies sites that may be exploited for therapeutic development. Highlights – HDX-MS rapidly identifies epitopes of camelid single-chain nanobodies raised against Class IB PI3K complexes, p110γ/p101 and p110γ/p84 – A nanobody targeting p101 improves local resolution in EM studies with p110γ/p101 facilitating structural characterization of the complex – Nanobodies that bind at the interfaces with the lipidated activators Ras and Gβγ can prevent activation of p110γ/p101 and p110γ/p84","Rathinaswamy, Manoj K; Fleming, Kaelin D; Dalwadi, Udit; Pardon, Els; Harris, Noah J; Yip, Calvin K; Steyaert, Jan; Burke, John E",bioRxiv,231,1

Our approaches have taken into consideration the different needs of taught and non-taught modules, robustness of online assessment, and quick orientation for students who were unfamiliar with online education. The consequent effectiveness of teaching and learning was evaluated in terms of instructor participation and student participation. The findings indicated a relatively slow start due to the series of necessary adjustments to be made to encounter the shift. However, once the adaptation process was completed, an enhancing trend was observed in students and instructors' engagement in various online teaching and learning practices.

The process of homologous repair can be exploited to integrate, in principle, any foreign DNA into a target site, provided the introduced DNA is flanked at both the 5’ and 3’ ends by sequences homologous to the region surrounding the double-strand break. We have developed a tool set that requires a minimum of steps to induce double-strand breaks at chromosomal target sites with the meganuclease I-SceI and select integration events at those sites. We demonstrate this method in two different applications. First, the introduction of site-specific single-nucleotide phosphorylation site mutations into the S. cerevisiae gene SPO12. Second, the precise chromosomal replacement of eleven S. cerevisiae proteasome genes with their human orthologs. Placing the human genes under S. cerevisiae transcriptional control allowed us to update our of model of functional replacement. Our experience suggests that using native promoters may be a useful general strategy for the coordinated expression of foreign genes in S. cerevisiae.

Several governments, organizations, and individuals recognize that social media has yielded significant advantages to their practices and easily delivers their messages. For the first time in their history, some governments and businesses offer jobs related to the social media landscape, such as Social Media Specialist, due to the technological and information revolution. Certainly, social media enables its users to distribute information and reach a mass audience irrespective of their geographic and demographic boundaries. Therefore, social media could breed new challenges when misused and exploited in dispensing rumors and misleading facts to the public, especially in crises. This chapter aims to underscore social media's existence and how it paves the way to smooth the flow of information and communication worldwide. By employing social media tools in their practices, both governments and businesses witness exceptional outcomes and acknowledge that social media laid the foundation for more effective communication. This chapter will also highlight social media’s disadvantages in increasing false information and inadequate facts that drive more uncertainty, sadness, anger, and lack of confidence among the public. It will also address the concept of crisis in general and focus on crisis management and crisis communication. Moreover, some countries will clarify the actions relevant to information filtering via prohibiting some popular websites and social media platforms. Furthermore, it will identify how governments and businesses deal with rumors in crisis, for example, COVID-19 outbreak, wars, financial scandals, business interruptions, and the like.

Objective: To investigate the prevalence of parents who have vaccinated their children against the COVID-19 and the factors influencing this decision. Methods: We conducted a web-based cross-sectional study in Greece during the first week of September 2021. The study questionnaire was distributed through social media and a convenience sample was obtained. Only parents with children aged 12-17 years old could participate in the study. We collected socio-demographic data of parents and we measured their attitudes towards vaccination and COVID-19 pandemic. Results: Study population included 656 parents. Mean age of parents was 45.5 years, while most of them were mothers with a high level of education. Regarding vaccination, 27.1% of parents had their children vaccinated against the COVID-19, while almost all children had a complete vaccination history (98.9%). The most important reasons for decline of COVID-19 vaccination were doubts about the safety and effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines (45.3%) and fear of side effects (36.6%). Regarding the information about the COVID-19 vaccines, parents showed more trust in family doctors than in scientists and the government. Multivariate regression analysis identified that increased parents age, increased trust in COVID-19 vaccines, and positive attitude of parents towards vaccination had a positive effect on children vaccination. Conclusions: Understanding the factors influencing parents' decision to vaccinate their children against the COVID-19 is crucial to increase the COVID-19 vaccination coverage rate.

A potential role for somatosensory stimulation in sleep regulation,14.283799,6.9723244,2022,"After encoding, memories go through a labile state followed by a stabilization process known as consolidation. Once consolidated they can enter a new labile state after the presentation of a reminder of the original memory, followed by a period of restabilization (reconsolidation). During these periods of lability the memory traces can be modified. Currently, there are studies that show a rapid stabilization after 30 min, while others show that stabilization occurs after longer periods (e.g. 6 h). Here we investigate the effect of an interference treatment on declarative memory consolidation, comparing distinct time intervals after acquisition. On day 1, participants learned a list of non-syllable pairs (List 1). Immediately after, 30 min, 3 h or 8 h later, they received an interference list (List 2) that acted as an amnesic agent. On day 2 (48 h after training) participants had to recall List 1 first, followed by List 2. We found that the List 1 memory was susceptible to interference when the List 2 was administered immediately or 3 h after learning; however, shortly after acquisition (e.g. 30 min) the List 1 memory becomes transiently protected against interference. We propose the possibility that this rapid memory protection could be induced by a fast and transient neocortical integration (where the memory is transiently protected) becoming partially independent from the hippocampus followed by a hippocampal re-engagement where the memory becomes susceptible to interferences again. Our results open a discussion about the contribution of molecular and systemic aspects to memory consolidation.","Moyano Malen, D.; Giulia, Carbonari; Matías, Bonilla; Pedreira María, E.; Brusco Luis, I.; Laura, Kaczer; Cecilia, Forcato",bioRxiv,231,20

Trends influence decisions about funding for research, decisions about organisational infrastructure, and the establishment of new degrees. The dictionary definition of trend is a general direction in which something is developing or changing, and also a fashion. According to these definitions, a trend is both measurable with evidence that confirms the trend’s existence and direction, and at the same time emergent, and sometimes fleeting. There is little in the design of tertiary institutions that encourages a timely response to trends, and yet there are people within universities who invest significant time in providing support for the implementation of new types of technology or pedagogical approaches for teaching and research staff. Outside of university settings, these would be R&D teams – testing the use of the latest technology and figuring out how it could be implemented in new contexts.

The aim of this study was to determine lung involvement in confirmed/suspected COVID-19 patients (encountered at an independent radiology practice) and its correlation to vaccination status amidst the second COVID-19 wave in India. Methods We retrospectively queried our data since April 2021 to identify adult patients (>17 years) who had confirmed (positive RT-PCR or antigen test) or suspected COVID-19 (classic symptoms but negative RT-PCR) and received a high-resolution CT scan to determine the extent of their lung involvement using the CT severity (CORAD) score. Patients were classified in 3 groups based on their vaccination status to determine its correlation with the CORAD score: fully vaccinated, partially vaccinated, and unvaccinated. Basic descriptive statistics, univariate tests and multivariate linear regression analysis were used. Results We identified 229 patients (median age 45 years, 60% male) of which 205 (89%) had confirmed COVID-19 (positive RT-PCR) and 24 had suspected disease (negative RT-PCT but classic symptoms). Of the 229 patients 29 (13%) had complete vaccination, 38 (17%) had partial vaccination and 162 (70%) had no vaccination. The CT score of the completely vaccinated patients was significantly lower compared to partially or unvaccinated patients (median 0 v. 3.5 v. 10, respectively p<.01). A multivariate linear regression model showed that partial or fully vaccinated patients had lower CT severity score compared to unvaccinated patients (adjusted R squared = 0.47). Conclusion We present here the real-world findings from an independent radiology practice (a unique and common practice model), in India amid the second COVID-19 wave showing significantly lower CT severity score in fully or partially vaccinated patients compared to unvaccinated patients.

DESIGN Systematic review of studies that have considered impacts of vaccines in relation to baseline risks. Calculation of risk reduction and harms from published data in two random controlled trials and one population-based implementation study. Analysis of risk reductions in geographical areas with varying baseline risks. Comparison of results concerning COVID-19 vaccine and selected prior vaccines. SETTING Random controlled trials of Pfizer and Moderna vaccines in multiple countries; population-based study using Pfizer vaccine in Israel. Counties with varying baseline risks in the United States; states with varying baseline risks in India. PARTICIPANTS 43,448 and 30,420 subjects in the random controlled trials; 1,198,236 subjects in the population-based study. INTERVENTIONS Multi-site random controlled trials of vaccine efficacy; population-based administration of vaccine with determination of effectiveness by comparison of vaccinated and unvaccinated subjects. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Relative risk reduction (RRR), absolute risk reduction (ARR), number needed to be vaccinated to prevent one symptomatic infection (NNV), absolute risk of the intervention (ARI), and number needed to harm (NNH). RESULTS A systematic review of literature in medicine and public health showed very few reports regarding ARR, NNV, ARI, and NNH; use of these indicators to compare benefits versus harms; or analysis of these EBM indicators in the context of varying baseline risks. From data in the two random controlled trials and one population-based study, calculated ARR was approximately 1 percent (as compared to RRR of 50 to 95 percent), and NNV was in the range of 100 to 500. In comparisons of ARR and NNV versus ARI and NNH, benefits and harms were not markedly different. From a sensitivity analysis of ARR and NNV in population groups with varying baseline risks, the effectiveness of vaccines as measured by ARR and NNV was substantially higher in regions with high as compared to low baseline risks. The ARR for COVID-19 vaccines was somewhat smaller and the NNV somewhat larger than achieved by some vaccines to prevent influenza and smallpox. CONCLUSION The efficacy and effectiveness of major COVID-19 vaccines, as measured by RRR, are impressive. As measured by ARR and NNV, which take into account variation in baseline risks, the effectiveness of the vaccines is substantially higher in areas with higher baseline risks. This finding can contribute to educational efforts, informed consent procedures, and policy making about priorities for vaccine distribution, especially under conditions of access barriers linked to poverty and inequality. WHAT IS ALREADY KNOWN ON THIS TOPIC Major COVID-19 vaccines so far have shown impressive efficacy in random controlled trials and effectiveness in population-based studies. To determine efficacy and effectiveness, these studies have used relative risk reduction (RRR), which shows the difference in event rate between those receiving and not receiving a vaccine. Reports of efficacy and effectiveness have not yet clarified other key indicators from evidence-based medicine (EBM) that consider variations baseline risks. Such indicators include measures of benefits such as absolute risk reduction (ARR) and number needed to be vaccinated (NNV), as well as measures of harm such as absolute risk of the intervention (ARI) and number needed to harm (NNH). WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS For COVID-19 vaccines, calculated ARR is somewhat lower and NNV somewhat higher than for certain prior vaccines such as those for influenza and smallpox. Indicators of harm for COVID-19 vaccines, as measured by ARI and NNH, appear to be in the same order of magnitude as indicators of benefit such as ARR and NNV. The effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines, as measured by ARR and NNV, is substantially higher in geographical areas with high baseline risk, compared to areas with low baseline risk. These findings can assist in informed consent procedures, educational efforts, and priority setting in policies about distribution of vaccines, especially in the context of access barriers related to poverty and inequality.","Larkin, A.; Waitzkin, H.",,231,16

The institutional education system got a backseat. But Bachelor of Medicine and Bachelor of Surgery (MBBS) syllabus had to be covered within a stipulated time frame. As with every academic curriculum, online teaching had to be implemented in MBBS courses too without any scope for developing adequate logistics beforehand. Teachers, as well as students, tried their best to cope up with this 'new normal'. Every day student had to be online for few hours to attend their classes as per the modified roster during the pandemic. Aim: To gather the data regarding perspective, satisfaction and problems of online classes from the 1st year MBBS students and also to recommend the modifications for future curriculum and upgrade the quality based on the students' feedback and suggestions. Materials and Methods: This cross-sectional observational study was done in a single day across three government medical colleges of West Bengal after eight months of continued online classes since lockdown. Out of 700 google forms sent, 527 responses were received. An online survey was conducted among the first-year students through google forms, which was mailed to every student's email ID at a stipulated time of the day with prior notification. Responses were automatically analysed by google and were represented graphically. Results: A total of 527 responses were received, of which 145 were from females (27.5%) and 382 were from males (72.5%). Students were ready to adapt to this new development and 54.6% were more or less satisfied with the teaching methodologies, though interruption with the internet hampered their classes very often. Some could not afford the online class due to logistic or financial constraints. A 67.9% of students learnt to acquire in-depth knowledge by themselves though a good number of students (56.7%) disliked online classes and lost interest in the topic. Conclusion: Online teaching cannot replace classroom teaching but can complement it as compulsive prolonged online teaching made the learning self-directed. A thoughtful blending of online and offline classes can be implemented to make an Indian Medical Graduate (IMG) a lifelong learner.","Mukherjee, S. S.; Sarkar, K.

All the following factors contributed to Taiwan's early success in fighting COVID-19: the early establishment of a command center, the ""precision-prevention"" model of strategies that includes tight border controls and strict quarantine policy, the procuring of sufficient anti-pandemic medical supplies, and educating residents about public health awareness (e.g., promoting face mask wearing in public, maintaining proper social distance, and handwashing procedures). In addition, the country's medical facilities and a national health insurance program that are already in place along with the utilization of technology and big data also played a crucial role during the pandemic. Taiwan's success story may open up opportunities for the country to assume a leading role as a facilitator in the reallocation of the global supply chain and the creation of a new worldwide health coalition that includes Taiwan, unlike its lonely efforts 17 years ago when SARS hit the Southeast Asian and Pacific regions.","Kuo, C.

If, however, leukocyte cultures are first exposed to virus and then to ragweed antigen E or anti-IgE, significant enhancement of histamine release occurs. Both infectious and inactivated virus enhance histamine release and the degree of enhancement is related to the concentration of virus and the length of the incubation. Tissue culture fluid harvested 8 h after exposure of leukocytes to virus contains a soluble factor which is capable of enhancing histamine release when added to fresh leukocyte cultures. This factor has all the properties of interferon including species specificity and cannot be dissociated from the antiviral activity of interferon.

Thus far, only syncytium formation could be studied after transient expression of S. We have recently described a system in which viral infectivity is mimicked by using virus-like particles (VLPs) and reporter defective-interfering (DI) RNAs (E. C. W. Bos, W. Luytjes, H. Van der Meulen, H. K. Koerten, and W. J. M. Spaan, Virology 218:52-60, 1996). Production of VLPs of MHV-A59 was shown to be dependent on the expression of M and E. We now show in several ways that the infectivity of VLPs is dependent on S. Infectivity was lost when spikeless VLPs were produced. Infectivity was blocked upon treatment of the VLPs with MHV-A59-neutralizing anti-S monoclonal antibody (MAb) A2.3 but not with nonneutralizing anti-S MAb A1.4. When the target cells were incubated with antireceptor MAb CC1, which blocks MHV-A59 infection, VLPs did not infect the target cells. Thus, S-mediated VLP infectivity resembles MHV-A59 infectivity. The system can be used to identify domains in S that are essential for infectivity. As a first application, we investigated the requirements of cleavage of S for the infectivity of MHV-A59. We inserted three mutant S proteins that were previously shown to be uncleaved (E. C. W. Bos, L. Heijnen, W. Luytjes, and W. J. M. Spaan, Virology 214:453-463, 1995) into the VLPs.

The purpose of this study is to evaluate how various MEDLINE Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) interfaces map acronyms and initialisms to the MeSH vocabulary. METHODS The interfaces used in this study were: the PubMed MeSH database, the PubMed Automatic Term Mapping feature, the NLM Gateway Term Finder, and Ovid MEDLINE. Acronyms and initialisms were randomly selected from 2 print sources. The test data set included 415 randomly selected acronyms and initialisms whose related meanings were found to be MeSH terms. Each acronym and initialism was entered into each MEDLINE MeSH interface to determine if it mapped to the corresponding MeSH term. Separately, 46 commonly used acronyms and initialisms were tested. RESULTS While performance differed widely, the success rates were low across all interfaces for the randomly selected terms. The common acronyms and initialisms tested at higher success rates across the interfaces, but the differences between the interfaces remained. CONCLUSION Online interfaces do not always map medical acronyms and initialisms to their corresponding MeSH phrases. This may lead to inaccurate results and missed information if acronyms and initialisms are used in search strategies.","Shultz, Mary",Journal of the Medical Library Association : JMLA,231,1

METHODS This prospective study was approved by the local ethics committee and written informed consent was obtained from all patients. In 19 patients with PINS and 20 healthy controls, a standardized magnetic resonance neurography protocol at 3-tesla was performed with coverage of the upper arm and elbow (T2-weighted fat-saturated: echo time/repetition time 52/7,020 milliseconds, in-plane resolution 0.27 × 0.27 mm2). Lesion classification of the radial nerve trunk and its deep branch (which becomes the posterior interosseous nerve) was performed by visual rating and additional quantitative analysis of normalized T2 signal of radial nerve voxels. RESULTS Of 19 patients with PINS, only 3 (16%) had a focal neuropathy at the entry of the radial nerve deep branch into the supinator muscle at elbow/forearm level. The other 16 (84%) had proximal radial nerve lesions at the upper arm level with a predominant lesion focus 8.3 ± 4.6 cm proximal to the humeroradial joint. Most of these lesions (75%) followed a specific somatotopic pattern, involving only those fascicles that would form the posterior interosseous nerve more distally. CONCLUSIONS PINS is not necessarily caused by focal compression at the supinator muscle but is instead frequently a consequence of partial fascicular lesions of the radial nerve trunk at the upper arm level. Neuroimaging should be considered as a complementary diagnostic method in PINS.","Bäumer, Philipp; Kele, Henrich; Xia, Annie; Weiler, Markus; Schwarz, Daniel; Bendszus, Martin; Pham, Mirko",Neurology,231,28

METHODS We reviewed consecutive, newly diagnosed, untreated patients with COVID-19, anti-MDA5 dermatomyositis, or adult Still's disease. We compared their clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics, including the prevalence of macrophage activation syndrome and lung involvement in each disease. RESULTS The numbers of patients with COVID-19, anti-MDA5 dermatomyositis, and adult-onset Still's disease with hyperferritinaemia (serum ferritin ≥500ng/dL) who were included for main analysis were 22, 14, and 59, respectively. COVID-19 and adult Still's disease both featured hyperinflammatory status, such as high fever and elevated serum C-reactive protein, whereas COVID-19 and anti-MDA5 dermatomyositis both presented with severe interstitial lung disease and hypoxaemia. While two-thirds of the patients in each group met the criteria for macrophage-activated syndrome that is used in systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis, the HScore, an indicator of haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, was low in anti-MDA5 dermatomyositis and COVID-19 even in severe or critical cases. The findings of chest computed tomography were similar between COVID-19 and anti-MDA5 dermatomyositis. CONCLUSIONS COVID-19 shared clinical features with rheumatic diseases characterised by hyperferritinaemia, including anti-MDA5 dermatomyositis and adult Still's disease.

METHODS We conducted a prospective observational study from March 2004 to September 2005 with consecutive infants (ages 1-12 months) with severe acute bronchiolitis and considered ready to be extubated. We calculated mean airway pressure and oxygenation index. Before extubation we measured respiratory rate, tidal volume, rapid shallow breathing index, maximal inspiratory pressure, and load/force balance. Arterial blood gases were measured 1 hour before extubation. Extubation was classified as a failure if the infant needed re-intubation within 48 hours. RESULTS Extubation failure occurred in 6 (15%) of the 40 extubated infants. The respective median (and interquartile range) age, weight, and days of mechanical ventilation for the extubation-failure and extubation-success groups were: age 5 (3-8) months versus 4 (4-6) months (P = .87), weight 4 (3-5) kg versus 6 (5-7) kg (P < .001), and mechanical ventilation days 8 (6-23) d versus 6 (5-12) d (P = .52). There were no significant differences in arterial blood gas values or mechanical-ventilation parameters between the extubation-success and extubation-failure groups. There were statistically significant differences between the extubation-failure and extubation-success groups for 2 risk factors, weight <or= 4 kg and tidal volume <or= 4 mL/kg, when those risk factors had a large area under the curve of the receiver operating characteristic. Variables that had a large area under the curve were minute volume <or= 0.8 mL/kg/min and maximal inspiratory pressure <or= 50 cm H(2)O. Variables that had a small area under the curve were load/force balance >or= 5 and rapid shallow breathing index >or= 6.7. CONCLUSIONS In infants with severe acute bronchiolitis the extubation process is complex because of the combined features of this disease. Pediatric studies have not definitely determined predictive factors, weaning protocols, or ventilatory predictive indexes of extubation failure risk in infants with severe acute bronchiolitis. Lower minute volume and lower maximal inspiratory pressure had large areas under the curve of the receiver operating characteristic for extubation-failure risk in infants with severe acute bronchiolitis.","Johnston, Cíntia; de Carvalho, Werther Brunow; Piva, Jefferson; Garcia, Pedro Celiny R; Fonseca, Marcelo Cunio",Respiratory care,231,8

We solved the structure of a catalytically inactive mutant version of Nsp15, which was crystallized as a hexamer. The structure contains unreported flexibility in the active site of each subunit. Substitutions in the active site residues serine 293 and proline 343 allowed Nsp15 to cleave at cytidylate, whereas mutation of leucine 345 rendered Nsp15 able to cleave at purines as well as pyrimidines. Mutations that targeted the residues involved in subunit interactions generally resulted in the formation of catalytically inactive monomers. The RNA-binding residues were mapped by a method linking reversible cross-linking, RNA affinity purification, and peptide fingerprinting. Alanine substitution of several residues in the RNA-contacting portion of Nsp15 did not affect hexamer formation but decreased the affinity of RNA binding and reduced endonuclease activity. This suggests a model for Nsp15 hexamer interaction with RNA.","Bhardwaj, Kanchan; Palaninathan, Satheesh; Alcantara, Joanna Maria Ortiz; Yi, Lillian Li; Guarino, Linda; Sacchettini, James C; Kao, C Cheng",The Journal of biological chemistry,231,1

This study demonstrates that comparative docking to multiple receptors can help to select homology models for virtual compound screening and to discover ligands that bind to one set of receptors but not to another, potentially similar, set. A serial docking algorithm is furthermore described that reduces the computational costs of such calculations by testing compounds against a series of receptor structures and discarding a compound as soon as it fails to satisfy specified bind/no bind criteria for each receptor. The algorithm also realizes substantial efficiencies by taking advantage of the fact that a ligand typically binds in similar conformations to similar receptors. Thus, once detailed docking has been used to fit a ligand into the first of a series of similar receptors, much less extensive calculations can be used for the remaining structures.","Fernandes, Miguel X; Kairys, Visvaldas; Gilson, Michael K",Journal of chemical information and computer sciences,231,33

This ORF consists of sequences derived from ORF1a, ORF1b, and the nucleocapsid gene. We have previously demonstrated that mutations that disrupt the ORF decrease the fitness of MIDI and its derivatives (R. J. de Groot, R. G. van der Most, and W. J. M. Spaan, J. Virol. 66:5898-5905, 1992). To determine whether translation of the ORF per se is required or whether the encoded polypeptide or a specific sequence is involved, we analyzed sets of related DI RNAs containing different ORFs. After partial deletion of ORF1b and nucleocapsid gene sequences, disruption of the remaining ORF is still lethal; translation of the entire ORF is not essential, however. When a large fragment of the MHV-A59 spike gene, which is not present in any of the MHV-A59 DI RNAs identified so far, was inserted in-frame into a MIDI derivative, translation across this sequence was vital to DI RNA survival. Thus, the translated sequence is irrelevant, indicating that translation per se plays a crucial role in DI virus propagation. Next, it was examined during which step of the viral life cycle translation plays its role. Since the requirement for translation also exists in DI RNA-transfected and MHV-infected cells, it follows that either the synthesis or degradation of DI RNAs is affected by translation.","van der Most, R G; Luytjes, W; Rutjes, S; Spaan, W J",Journal of virology,231,24

MATERIALS AND METHODS Consecutive patients treated by laparoscopic liver resections of left lateral segments were included. Controls were a group of 14 patients undergoing open resection for similar pathology. Primary outcomes were costs. Secondary outcomes were complications, conversions, blood loss, length of operation, and length of hospital stay. RESULTS The laparoscopic approach for hepatic left lateral resection (bisegmentectomy 2 and 3) was performed in fourteen patients (group I, median age 54 [range 26-82] years). In the open group, fourteen patients from a prospectively collected database with the same type of resection were selected (group II, median age 64 [range 29-76] years). Costs of theatre usage in the laparoscopic group were significantly lower (p=0.031). No significant differences in costs of disposable instruments, ward stay and total costs were observed between the two groups. There were three complications in the laparoscopic group compared with two complications in the open group. In the laparoscopic group there were 2 conversions (14%). Median blood loss was significantly lower in the laparoscopic group (50 mls [range 0-750], (p=0.001) versus the open group (500 mls [range 150-750]). Furthermore, operation time was also significantly lower in the laparoscopic group (116 [range 85-261] minutes) versus the open group (165 [range 96-217] minutes, p=0.016). Median length of stay was 6 [range 4-11] days in group I versus 6 [range 5-13] days in group II (p=0.508). CONCLUSION Costs of laparoscopic liver resections proved to be equivalent to open surgery. Furthermore, implementation of a laparoscopic liver resection programme seems feasible and safe with reduced blood loss and operation time and comparable morbidity and length of stay.","Stoot, J H M B; van Dam, R M; Coelen, R J S; Winkens, B; Olde Damink, S W M; Bemelmans, M H A; Dejong, C H C",Scandinavian journal of surgery : SJS : official organ for the Finnish Surgical Society and the Scandinavian Surgical Society,231,17

The identification of asymptomatic patients and mild cases among family and healthcare worker contacts of confirmed cases indicates a wider spectrum of clinical manifestation of the disease. The majority of patients presented with fever 98%, fever with cough 83%, and shortness of breath 72%. Radiographic manifestations range from unilateral infiltrate 43%, to increased bronchovascular markings 17%, and diffuse reticulonodular pattern 4%.

As 'diagnostic#10; PCR', a set of consensus nested primers was selected from highly conserved stretches of the nucleocapsid (N) gene. As 'phylogeny' PCR, a fragment of the spike protein gene (S1) was amplified and the PCR products were directly sequenced. To study the phylogenetic relationships of the viruses from various outbreaks, studies of molecular epizootiology were performed in Sweden, a Nordic region, where the occurrence of natural cases of the disease is relatively low and the occasional use of live vaccine(s) is well recorded and monitored. The disease appeared in the region in 1994, associated with production problems among layers of various ages. During outbreaks in 1995 and 1997, both layers and broilers were affected. To reduce losses, a live attenuated vaccine has been applied since 1997. By examining 12 cases between 1994 and 1998, molecular epizootiology revealed that, before 1997, the viruses had gene sequences very similar to strains of the Massachusetts serotype. However, comparative sequence analysis of the S1 gene revealed that the identity was not 100% to any of the strains of this serotype that we analysed. A virus related to the Dutch-type strain, D274, was also identified on one farm. Surprisingly, from 1997, the year that vaccination commenced with a live Massachusetts serotype vaccine, the majority of viruses detected had S1 sequences identical to the live Massachusetts vaccine strain. This genetic relation to the vaccine virus was also confirmed by N gene sequence analysis. The studies of molecular epizootiology reveal a strong probability that the vaccination had lead to the spread of the vaccine virus, causing various disease manifestations and a confusing epizootiological situation in the poultry population.","Farsang, A; Ros, C; Renström, Lena H M; Baule, Claudia; Soós, T; Belák, S",Avian pathology : journal of the W.V.P.A,231,11

The most prominent finding of the latter two diseases consists of typical demyelinated lesions distributed in selected areas of the CNS. The induction of high rates of animals with demyelination depends both on properties of the virus used for infection and host factors such as age and immune status.

METHODS Ninety-nine severe acute respiratory syndrome patients with persistent changes on follow-up chest radiography were included. One hundred seventy computed tomography examinations at baseline (n=70), 3 months (n=56), and 6 months (n=44) were retrospectively evaluated to determine the extent of ground-glass opacification, reticulation, and total parenchymal involvement. Patients' demographic information, clinical information during treatment, and results of lung function tests at 3 and 6 months were correlated with computed tomography findings. RESULTS A significant serial improvement in the extent of overall ground-glass opacification, overall reticulation, and total parenchymal involvement was observed (P <0.01). Advanced age, previous intensive care unit admission, mechanical ventilation, alternative treatment, higher peak lactate dehydrogenase, and peak radiographic involvement during treatment showed a positive correlation with overall reticulation and total parenchymal involvement at 6 months. There was a significant negative correlation between overall reticulation and total parenchymal involvement with diffusion capacity adjusted for hemoglobin at 3 and 6 months (P <0.01).

Viruses are the main pathogens of ARI in children. The purpose of the present study was to determine the epidemiologic features of respiratory viruses, including novel viruses, in outpatient and hospitalized children with ARI. METHOD From March 2010 to February 2012, 2066 children with ARI, including 1050 outpatients and 1016 inpatients, were involved in this study. One nasopharyngeal aspirate or throat swab specimen was collected from each patient. Reverse transcription (RT) PCRs were performed to detect common respiratory tract viruses including respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), human rhinovirus (HRV), influenza virus (IFV), parainfluenza virus (PIV) type 1-4, adenovirus (ADV), enterovirus (EV), human coronavirus (HCOV), human metapneumonia virus (HMPV) and human bocavirus (HBOV). RESULT At least one viral pathogen was identified in each of 1274 out of 2066 patients and the overall positive rate was 61.7%. The positive rate in inpatient (69.7%) was higher than that in outpatient (53.9%). The frequencies of detection of various viruses among in- and outpatients were different. RSV was the most prevalent virus detected among hospitalized children, followed by HRV and PIV, whereas IFV was the most frequently identified virus in the outpatient group, followed by ADV and PIV. Simultaneous detection of two or more viruses was found in 377 cases. Coinfection was more frequent in inpatients than in outpatients (30.1% vs. 6.8%, P < 0.001). CONCLUSION Respiratory viruses play an important role in children with ARI, especially in young children. RSV was the most prevalent virus detected among hospitalized children, whereas IFV was the most frequently identified virus in the outpatient group. Viral coinfections are frequently identified, particularly in hospitalized patients. Further studies are required to better understand the impact of coinfections in children with ARI.","Liu, Chun-Yan; Xiao, Yan; Xie, Zheng-de; Ren, Li-Li; Hu, Ying-Hui; Yao, Yuan; Yang, Yan; Qian, Su-Yun; Zhao, Cheng-Song; Shen, Kun-Ling",Zhonghua er ke za zhi = Chinese journal of pediatrics,231,24

Cardiovascular disease leads the ranking in deaths in adults in Argentina with 280 deaths per day, and in recent decades we have reduced its mortality by 20-30% through various evidence-based interventions. Herein we conducted predictive analyses to understand what could be the consequences of a worse implementation of those interventions. We estimate that less control of cardiovascular risk factors from April to October 2020 could cause up to 10 500 new preventable cases of cardiovascular disease. In terms of myocardial infarction, a drop from 40% to 60% of the reperfusion treatment could increase mortality by 3% to 5%. A marginal 10% to 15% increase in relative risk of cardiovascular death would be equivalent to an excess of 6000 to 9000 preventable deaths. In conclusion, given the high prevalence and fatality of cardiovascular disease, even a small negative impact on the efficacy of its care will translate into large numbers of people affected in Argentina. It is necessary to inform the authorities and educate the public so cardiovascular diseases and their risk factors remain a health priority, as long as resources exist and minimizing the risk of contagion and spread of the virus.","Lamelas, Pablo; Botto, Fernando; Pedernera, Gustavo; Alves De Lima, Alberto; Costabel, Juan Pablo; Belardi, Jorge",Medicina,231,32

Several viral proteins evade host immune response and target the NK cell receptor NKG2D and its ligands. Areas covered: This review aimed to describe the viruses and their proteins that interfere with the NKG2D receptor and their ligands, and how these interactions lead to immune evasion, host protection, and tissue damage from acute and chronic viral infections. Expert opinion: The study of viral proteins has already impacted the field of oncology. A prime example is the HBV vaccine and the development of antiviral drugs for HIV, Hepatitis C, and the family of Herpesviridae viruses. The NKG2D system seems to be a rational therapeutic target. Nevertheless, an effective cytotoxic response by NK cells is mediated by a network of activating and inhibitory receptors, the integration of which determines if the NK cell becomes cytotoxic or permissive. Immunotherapeutic agents that increase the antitumor lytic activity of NK cells through modulating activation and inhibitory signaling of NK cells are being developed. Nevertheless, more research is needed to dissect the integrative mechanism of NK cells function to fully exploit their antitumor and antiviral effector mechanisms.","Chávez-Blanco, Alma; Chacón-Salinas, Rommel; Dominguez-Gomez, Guadalupe; Gonzalez-Fierro, Aurora; Perez-Cardenas, Enrique; Taja-Chayeb, Lucia; Trejo-Becerril, Catalina; Duenas-Gonzalez, Alfonso",Expert opinion on therapeutic targets,231,24

Because the domains of law that apply to public health are equally broad, the Article next offers a conceptual framework for identifying the types of laws most suitable to different public health problems. Finally, the role of lawyers in the applied field of public health law is examined, first to encourage attention to law's effect on health, even laws having little apparent relationship to health; and second, to recognize that laws intended to achieve specific health outcomes may affect broader legal principles. Lawyers have a unique role to play in ensuring that the legal principles used to promote health also preserve justice.","Mariner, Wendy K",Journal of health law,231,9

Patients with ALI from SARS who require mechanical ventilation should receive a lung protective, low tidal volume strategy. Adjuvant treatments recommended include prevention of venous thromboembolism, stress ulcer prophylaxis, and semirecumbent positioning during ventilation. Based on previous experience in Canada, infection control resources and protocols were recommended. Leadership structure, communication, training, and morale are an essential aspect of SARS management. A multicenter, placebo-controlled trial of corticosteroids for late SARS is justified because of widespread clinical use and uncertainties about relative risks and benefits.

Both viruses efficiently infected alveolar epithelial cells of both the apical and basolateral surfaces of the epithelium, whereas release of newly formed virus was mainly from the apical surface of the epithelium. 3. H5N1 virus was a more potent inducer of cytokines and chemokines in alveolar epithelial cells than H1N1 virus. Such chemokines were secreted onto both the apical and basolateral surfaces of the polarised alveolar epithelium. 4. In bronchial epithelium, the H5N1 virus replicated more efficiently and induced a stronger type I interferon response in the undifferentiated NHBE cells than did H1N1 virus. In contrast, in well-differentiated cultures, H5N1 virus replication was less efficient and elicited a lower interferon-beta response than did H1N1 virus. 5.

METHODS: We systematically reviewed randomized controlled trials (RCTs), using MEDLINE (2010-2020) and EMBASE (2010-2020) databases, reporting AE in chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine users during treatment for lupus, rheumatoid arthritis, malaria and COVID-19. The protocol for this systematic review is registered at the PROSPERO database (CRD42020197938). The quality of the included studies was assessed using the Cochrane risk-of-Bias tool and relevant data were extracted though a customized data collection form, independently, by two authors. The IRR of AE was estimated using a random-effect model meta-analysis and heterogeneity was evaluated by T2 and I2. Subgroup analysis was performed, and publication bias was assessed by funnel-plot. RESULTS: Forty-six RCTs met our eligibility criteria and were included in our analysis (23132 patients). There was not a single death attributed to chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine use in the included RCTs. The IRR of general AE during antimalarial use was 1.15 [CI 95% 1.01-1.31]. COVID-19 patients treated with either antimalarial presented an 83% and 165% higher risk of developing general and gastrointestinal AE, respectively, in comparison with controls. The use of antimalarial increased the risk of developing dermatological AE by 92% in malarial studies and reduced by 65% in lupus studies. We did not find a significatively higher risk of cardiovascular nor ophthalmological AE in antimalarial users. CONCLUSIONS: Our data reinforces that chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine have a good safety profile though caution is advised when using higher than usual doses in hospitalized COVID-19 patients.","Edington, Fernando Luiz Barros; Gadellha, Sandra Rocha; Santiago, Mittermayer Barreto",Eur J Intern Med,231,33

The pandemic has further widened the disparities in health care and exposed vulnerable populations. Health care services caring for such populations must not only continue to operate but create innovative methods of care delivery without compromising safety. We present our experience of incorporating telemedicine in our university hospital-based outpatient clinic in one of the worst-hit areas in the world. OBJECTIVE: Our goal is to assess the adoption of a telemedicine service in the first month of its implementation in outpatient practice during the COVID-19 pandemic. We also want to assess the need for transitioning to telemedicine, the benefits and challenges in doing so, and ongoing solutions during the initial phase of the implementation of telemedicine services for our patients. METHODS: We conducted a prospective review of clinic operations data from the first month of a telemedicine rollout in the outpatient adult ambulatory clinic from April 1, 2020, to April 30, 2020. A telemedicine visit was defined as synchronous audio-video communication between the provider and patient for clinical care longer than 5 minutes or if the video visit converted to a telephone visit after 5 minutes due to technical problems. We recorded the number of telemedicine visits scheduled, visits completed, and the time for each visit. We also noted the most frequent billing codes used based on the time spent in the patient care and the number of clinical tasks (eg, activity suggested through diagnosis or procedural code) that were addressed remotely by the physicians. RESULTS: During the study period, we had 110 telemedicine visits scheduled, of which 94 (85.4%) visits were completed. The average duration of the video visit was 35 minutes, with the most prolonged visit lasting 120 minutes. Of 94 patients, 24 (25.54%) patients were recently discharged from the hospital, and 70 (74.46%) patients were seen for urgent care needs. There was a 50% increase from the baseline in the number of clinical tasks that were addressed by the physicians during the pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: There was a high acceptance of telemedicine services by the patients, which was evident by a high show rate during the COVID-19 pandemic in Detroit. With limited staffing, restricted outpatient work hours, a shortage of providers, and increased outpatient needs, telemedicine was successfully implemented in our practice.","Garg, Alpana; Goyal, Sachin; Thati, Rohit; Thati, Neelima",JMIR Public Health Surveill,231,1

Many technology and intelligent algorithms have been developed to set the boundary in its incremental growth. This paper proposed a concept to set the boundary on spreading of this disease among the medic people, who are directly exposed to the COVID-19 patient. To reduce their risk to be infected, we have designed the theoretical model of the medic robot to provide medical services to the confirmed case patient. This paper explains the deployment and execution of assigned work of medic robot for patient carrying, delivering food, medications and handling the emergency health services. The medic robots are divided into various group based on their works. The COVID-19 area is considered as a multi-robot environment, where multiple medic robots will work simultaneously. To achieve the multi-robot cooperation and collision avoidance we have implemented the simplest reinforcement learning approach i.e. the Q-learning approach. We have compared the result with respect to the improved-Q-learning approach. A comparative analysis based on parameters like simplicity, objective, deployed robot category and cooperation has been done with some other approaches mentioned in the literature. For simplicity as well as the time and space complexity purpose the results reveal that Q-learning approach is a better consideration.

This study investigated the role of trauma experiences, personality traits, and genotype in the maintenance of PTSD symptoms. METHODS: In a previous large-scale epidemiological investigation 1 year after the Wenchuan earthquake, 215 children with PTSD symptoms were selected at random with their blood samples collected. All of them were followed up, and their PTSD symptoms were assessed 3 years later. The adolescent version of the UCLA PTSD Reaction Index, the earthquake exposure scale, and the Junior Eysenck Personality Questionnaire were used to determine PTSD symptoms, trauma experiences, and personality traits, respectively. We sequenced candidate genes involved in the regulation of long-term potentiation via NMDA-type receptors to identify the related SNP variations. RESULTS: Being trapped for a longer period of time, feeling one's own or a family member's life to be in danger, losing a close family member or friend, extraversion, neuroticism, TrkB, G72 and CNTF were found to be associated with the maintenance of PTSD symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Experiences, personality traits, and genotype influenced the maintenance of PTSD in child survivors who were considered to be followed up without medicine.

Recent studies show that liver injury could be a manifestation of the disease, and that liver disease could also be related to a worse prognosis. Our aim was to compare the characteristics of patients with severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) due to SARS-CoV-2 who required intubation versus stable hospitalized patients to identify the early biochemical predictive factors of a severe course of COVID-19 and subsequent requirement for intubation, specifically in Mexican. Methods: This was an observational case-control study nested in a cohort study. Complete medical records of patients admitted for confirmed COVID-19 at a tertiary level center in Mexico City were reviewed. Clinical and biochemical data were collected, and the characteristics of patients who required invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) (cases) were compared with stable hospitalized patients without ventilation (controls). Results: We evaluated 166 patients with COVID-19 due to SARS-CoV-2 infection; 114 (68.7%) were men, the mean age was 50.6 ± 13.3 years, and 27 (16.3%) required IMV. The comparative analysis between cases and controls showed (respectively) significantly lower blood oxygen saturation (SpO2) (73.5 ± 12.0% vs. 83.0 ± 6.8%, P < 0.0001) and elevated alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (128 (14-1123) IU/L vs. 33 (8-453) IU/L, P = 0.003), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (214 (17-1247) vs. 44 (12-498) IU/L, P = 0.001), lactic dehydrogenase (LDH) (764.6 ± 401.9 IU/L vs. 461.0 ± 185.6 IU/L, P = 0.001), and D-dimer (3463 (524-34,227) ng/mL vs. 829 (152-41,923) ng/mL, P = 0.003) concentrations. Patients in the cases group were older (58.6 ± 12.7 years vs. 49.1 ± 12.8 years, P=0.001). Multivariate analysis showed that important factors at admission predicting the requirement for IMV during hospitalization for COVID-19 were AST &#8805;250 IU/L (odds ratio (OR) = 64.8, 95% confidence interval (CI) 7.5-560.3, P < 0.0001) and D-dimer &#8805; 3500 ng/mL (OR = 4.1, 95% CI 1.2-13.7, P=0.02).

As a result, child maltreatment experts are concerned that there will be an influx of children requiring trauma assessment and treatment during and after COVID-19. As physical distancing measures have been implemented and will likely persist into 2021, organizations providing trauma treatment to children and their families have had to rapidly pivot to telemental health to maintain service delivery with clients. While the benefits of telemental health have been identified, including reduced barriers to access, increased cost effectiveness, and broad availability of services, there are unique limitations to its implementation within a child maltreatment population, such as challenges with attention and emotion regulation skills, difficulties identifying dissociative symptoms, and increased time with perpetrators of abuse due to shelter in place orders. These limitations are exacerbated for children and families who are most marginalized and facing the highest levels of social and economic barriers. Lack of access to reliable technology, lack of a private or confidential space for sessions, and reluctance to process trauma in the absence of a safe environment, are all barriers to conducting effective trauma treatment over telemental health. This article discusses both the benefits and barriers to telemental health in a child maltreatment population and offers considerations for child trauma service provision, program development, and policy during and post the COVID-19 pandemic.","Racine, Nicole; Hartwick, Cailey; Collin-Vézina, Delphine; Madigan, Sheri",Child Abuse Negl,231,33

Universities worldwide have dealt with obstacles in terms of continuing face-to-face education. An online learning system is an indispensable solution for all universities. However, students have not been adequately prepared to use online learning systems. This study examines the factors that impact the use of online learning systems by accounting students in Jordanian public universities. A model combining the critical factors from social capital theory (SCT), the theory of reasoned action (TRA), and the technology acceptance model (TAM) is proposed. Data obtained from 274 students through previously tested and validated questionnaires are used to test students' actual use of the online learning system and to determine the factors that positively or negatively impact the use of this system. As hypothesized, the results show that social trust influences the perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use of online learning. In addition, the perceived usefulness of the online learning system is positively affected by its perceived ease of use and subjective norms. This study finds three significant predictors of attitudes toward use decisions: subjective norms, perceived ease of use, and perceived usefulness. The results are valuable to accounting educators, accounting students, universities, and higher education institutions.","Alshurafat, Hashem; Al Shbail, Mohannad Obeid; Masadeh, Walid Muhammad; Dahmash, Firas; Al-Msiedeen, Jebreel Mohammad",Educ Inf Technol (Dordr),231,18

Autonomy is a broad and expansive capability that enables systems to behave without direct control by a human operator. To that end, it is expected to be present in a wide variety of systems and applications. A vast range of industrial sectors, including (but by no means limited to) defense, mobility, health care, manufacturing, and civilian infrastructure, are embracing the opportunities in autonomy yet face the similar barriers toward establishing the necessary level of assurance sooner or later. Numerous government agencies are poised to tackle the challenges in assured autonomy. Given the already immense interest and investment in autonomy, a series of workshops on Assured Autonomy was convened to facilitate dialogs and increase awareness among the stakeholders in the academia, industry, and government. This series of three workshops aimed to help create a unified understanding of the goals for assured autonomy, the research trends and needs, and a strategy that will facilitate sustained progress in autonomy. The first workshop, held in October 2019, focused on current and anticipated challenges and problems in assuring autonomous systems within and across applications and sectors. The second workshop held in February 2020, focused on existing capabilities, current research, and research trends that could address the challenges and problems identified in workshop.

Therefore, we systematically reviewed and meta-analyzed the chest CT imaging signature of COVID-19. RESEARCH QUESTION: What is the chest CT imaging signature of COVID-19 infection? STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: A systematic literature search was performed for original studies on chest CT imaging findings in patients with COVID-19. Methodologic quality of studies was evaluated. Pooled prevalence of chest CT imaging findings were calculated with the use of a random effects model in case of between-study heterogeneity (predefined as I2 &#8805;50); otherwise, a fixed effects model was used. RESULTS: Twenty-eight studies were included. The median number of patients with COVID-19 per study was 124 (range, 50-476), comprising a total of 3,466 patients. Median prevalence of symptomatic patients was 99% (range, >76.3%-100%). Twenty-seven of the studies (96%) had a retrospective design. Methodologic quality concerns were present with either risk of or actual referral bias (13 studies), patient spectrum bias (eight studies), disease progression bias (26 studies), observer variability bias (27 studies), and test review bias (14 studies). Pooled prevalence was 10.6% for normal chest CT imaging findings. Pooled prevalences were 90.0% for posterior predilection, 81.0% for ground-glass opacity, 75.8% for bilateral abnormalities, 73.1% for left lower lobe involvement, 72.9% for vascular thickening, and 72.2% for right lower lobe involvement. Pooled prevalences were 5.2% for pleural effusion, 5.1% for lymphadenopathy, 4.1% for airway secretions/tree-in-bud sign, 3.6% for central lesion distribution, 2.7% for pericardial effusion, and 0.7% for cavitation/cystic changes. Pooled prevalences of other CT imaging findings ranged between 10.5% and 63.2%. INTERPRETATION: Studies on chest CT imaging findings in COVID-19 suffer from methodologic quality concerns. More high-quality research is necessary to establish diagnostic CT criteria for COVID-19. Based on the available evidence that requires cautious interpretation, several chest CT imaging findings appear to be suggestive of COVID-19, but normal chest CT imaging findings do not exclude COVID-19, not even in symptomatic patients.","Adams, Hugo J A; Kwee, Thomas C; Yakar, Derya; Hope, Michael D; Kwee, Robert M",Chest,231,20

Details on two underwater sites are reported: Cape Bruguieres, comprising > 260 recorded lithic artefacts at depths down to -2.4 m below sea level, and Flying Foam Passage where the find spot is associated with a submerged freshwater spring at -14 m. The sites were discovered through a purposeful research strategy designed to identify underwater targets, using an iterative process incorporating a variety of aerial and underwater remote sensing techniques and diver investigation within a predictive framework to map the submerged landscape within a depth range of 0-20 m. The condition and context of the lithic artefacts are analysed in order to unravel their depositional and taphonomic history and to corroborate their in situ position on a pre-inundation land surface, taking account of known geomorphological and climatic processes including cyclone activity that could have caused displacement and transportation from adjacent coasts. Geomorphological data and radiometric dates establish the chronological limits of the sites and demonstrate that they cannot be later than 7000 cal BP and 8500 cal BP respectively, based on the dates when they were finally submerged by sea-level rise. Comparison of underwater and onshore lithic assemblages shows differences that are consistent with this chronological interpretation. This article sets a foundation for the research strategies and technologies needed to identify archaeological targets at greater depth on the Australian continental shelf and elsewhere, building on the results presented.

A GETTEC multicentric study,14.432853,6.895614,2020,"Background: The coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic has placed unprecedented stress on health systems and has been associated with elevated risk for delirium. The convergence of pandemic resource limitation and clinical demand associated with delirium requires careful risk stratification for targeted prevention efforts. Objectives: To develop an incident delirium predictive model among coronavirus disease 2019 patients. Methods: We applied supervised machine learning to electronic health record data for inpatients with coronavirus disease 2019 at three hospitals to build an incident delirium diagnosis prediction model. We validated this model in three different hospitals. Both hospital cohorts included academic and community settings. Results: Among 2907 patients across 6 hospitals, 488 (16.8%) developed delirium. Applying the predictive model in the external validation cohort of 755 patients, the c-index was 0.75 (0.71-0.79) and the lift in the top quintile was 2.1. At a sensitivity of 80%, the specificity was 56%, negative predictive value 92%, and positive predictive value 30%. Equivalent model performance was observed in subsamples stratified by age, sex, race, need for critical care and care at community vs. academic hospitals. Conclusion: Machine learning applied to electronic health records available at the time of inpatient admission can be used to risk-stratify patients with coronavirus disease 2019 for incident delirium. Delirium is common among patients with coronavirus disease 2019, and resource constraints during a pandemic demand careful attention to the optimal application of predictive models.","Castro, V.

METHODS: First, we analysed the different clinical, biological and SF variables associated with the diagnosis of SA (according to the Newman's criteria) in a monocentric cohort of acute arthritis (<30 days) (n = 233) (SYNOLACTATE cohort). A new score predictive of SA (RESAS) was created using the independent discriminant variables after multivariate analysis. A value was attributed to each variable of the score according to the weighting based on their likelihood ratio for the diagnosis of SA. RESAS performance was then tested on the first cohort (internal validation) and then checked on a second independent cohort (n = 70) (external validation). RESULTS: After multivariate analysis, four independent variables of the SF were included for RESAS: (i) purulent SF or white blood cells count &#8805;70 000/mm3; (ii) absence/presence of crystals; (iii) lactate; and (iv) glucose synovial level.

The performance of RESAS to predicted SA was excellent with area under the curve (AUC)=0.928 (0.877-0.980) in internal validation and AUC=0.986 (0.962-1.00) in external validation. For a RESAS threshold &#8805;+4, SA was diagnosed with Se=56.0% (0.371-0.733), Sp=98.1% (0.952-0.993), LR+=29.1 (10.4-81.6) in the first cohort and with Se=91.7% (0.646-0.985), Sp=98.3% (0.909-0.997), LR+=53.2 (7.56-373) in the second cohort. CONCLUSION: RESAS is a new composite score of four SF variables with excellent performance to predicted SA in acute arthritis population.","Coiffier, Guillaume; Berthoud, Olivia; Albert, Jean David; Robin, François; Goussault, Claire; Gougeon-Jolivet, Anne; Bendavid, Claude; Guggenbuhl, Pascal",Rheumatology (Oxford),231,21

High frequency of somatic integration of the RNA virus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) into the DNA of infected cells was recently suggested, based on a number of observations. One key observation was the presence of chimeric RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) reads between SARS-CoV-2 RNA and RNA transcribed from human host DNA. Here, we examined the possible origin specifically of human-SARS-CoV-2 chimeric reads in RNA-seq libraries and provide alternative explanations for their origin. Chimeric reads were frequently detected also between SARS-CoV-2 RNA and RNA transcribed from mitochondrial DNA or episomal adenoviral DNA present in transfected cell lines, which was unlikely the result of SARS-CoV-2 integration. Furthermore, chimeric reads between SARS-CoV-2 RNA and RNA transcribed from nuclear DNA were highly enriched for host exonic, rather than intronic or intergenic sequences and often involved the same, highly expressed host genes. Although these findings do not rule out SARS-CoV-2 somatic integration, they nevertheless suggest that human-SARS-CoV-2 chimeric reads found in RNA-seq data may arise during library preparation and do not necessarily signify SARS-CoV-2 reverse transcription, integration in to host DNA and further transcription.","Kazachenka, A.; Kassiotis, G.",Frontiers in Microbiology,231,16

In order to evaluate the feasibility of training nuclear segmentation models on small, custom annotated image datasets that have been augmented, we have designed a computational pipeline to systematically compare different nuclear segmentation model architectures and model training strategies. Using this approach, we demonstrate that transfer learning and tuning of training parameters, such as the composition, size, and preprocessing of the training image dataset, can lead to robust nuclear segmentation models, which match, and often exceed, the performance of existing, off-the-shelf deep learning models pretrained on large image datasets. We envision a practical scenario where deep learning nuclear segmentation models trained in this way can be shared across a laboratory, facility, or institution, and continuously improved by training them on progressively larger and varied image datasets. Our work provides computational tools and a practical framework for deep learning-based biological image segmentation using small annotated image datasets. Published [2020].

METHODS: Thirty-eight patients with confirmed COVID-19 and 31 healthy controls were included in this prospective and observational study. Individuals with COVID-19 formed the patient group, and healthy individuals formed the control group. Conjunctival impression cytology (CIC), TBUT, Schirmer II test, and ocular surface disease index were evaluated in all participants. RESULTS: No significant difference was observed regarding the mean age and gender between the groups (P=0.786 and P=0.122, respectively). The mean TBUT and Schirmer II test results did not differ between the two groups (P=0.496 and P=0.447, respectively). The CIC results revealed decreased density and cell size of goblet cells and moderate to high enlargement, squamous changes, and increased nucleocytoplasmic ratio in nongoblet epithelial cells in the COVID-19 group compared with the control group. Based on the Nelson classification in CIC samples, 60.6% of the COVID-19 group and 19.4% of the control group had changes consistent with grade 2 or above. The presence of neutrophils in CIC was significantly higher in the COVID-19 group (P<0.001), whereas the presence of lymphocyte was similar between the two groups (P=0.247). CONCLUSION: This study revealed the pathological conjunctival alterations in patients with COVID-19 and demonstrated that pathological ocular surface alterations may present even at the beginning of COVID-19 without clinically significant ocular manifestation.","Bozkurt, Erdinç; Özates, Serdar; Muhafiz, Ersin; Yilmaz, Fatma; Caliskan, Okan",Eye contact lens,231,5

It has an active IND for COVID-19. Antiviral activities have been found for PT150 and other members of its class in a variety of virus families; thus, it was now tested against SARS-CoV-2 in human bronchial epithelial lining cells and showed effective 90% inhibitory antiviral concentration (EC90) of 5.55 µM. PT150 is a member of an extended platform of novel glucocorticoid receptor (GR) and androgen receptor (AR) modulating molecules.

Often, this path starts with innovation from academic collaborations amongst biologists, chemists, and engineers, followed by the formation of a start-up company driving clinical translation and approval. An early wave featured injectable (i.e., intramuscular, subcutaneous) biodegradable polymeric microspheres to control drug release profiles for peptides and small molecules (e.g., Lupron Depot®, Risperdal Consta®). With these early successes for microspheres, research shifted to exploring systemic delivery by intravenous injection, which required smaller particle sizes and modified surface properties (e.g., PEGylation) to enable long circulation times. These new innovations resulted in the nanoparticle medicines Doxil® and Abraxane®, designed to improve the therapeutic index of cytotoxic cancer agents by decreasing systemic exposure and delivering more drug to tumors. Very recently, the first siRNA lipid nanoparticle medicine, Patisiran (Onpattro®), was approved for treating hereditary transthyretin-mediated amyloidosis.

To minimise this, the Guy's and St Thomas' Hospital NHS Foundation Trust elective surgery hub and the executive team at London Bridge Hospital (LBH) created an elective operating framework at LBH, a COVID-19 minimal site, in which patients self-isolated for two weeks and proceeded with surgery only following a negative preoperative SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction swab. The aim was to determine the rates of rates of postoperative COVID-19 infection. METHODS: The collaboration involved three large hospital trusts, covering the geographic area of south-east London. All patients were referred to LBH for elective surgery. Patients were followed up by telephone interview at four weeks postoperatively. RESULTS: Three hundred and ninety-eight patients from 13 surgical specialties were included in the analysis. The median age was 60 (IQR 29-71) years. Sixty-three per cent (252/398) were female. In total, 78.4% of patients had an American Society of Anesthesiologists grade of 1-2 and the average BMI was 27.2 (IQR 23.7-31.8) kg/m2. Some 83.6% (336/402) were 'major' operations. The rate of COVID-19-related death in our cohort was 0.25% (1/398). Overall, there was a 1.26% (5/398) 30-day postoperative all-cause mortality rate. Seven patients (1.76%) reported COVID-19 symptoms, but none attended the emergency department or were readmitted to hospital as a result. CONCLUSION: The risk of contracting COVID-19 in our elective operating framework was very low. We demonstrate that high-volume major surgery is safe, even at the peak of the pandemic, if patients are screened appropriately preoperatively.","Chong, Smy; Hung, Rky; Gwozdz, A; Irwin, S; Eastbury, J; Cross, T; Ahmed, K; Taylor, C; Goldenberg, S D; Sanderson, J; Olsburgh, J",Ann R Coll Surg Engl,231,10

The biomass pretreatment efficiency of the DESs had improved with increasing the polarity and hydrogen bond acidity (&#945;) of the DESs. Among the studied DESs, ChCl:lactic acid:formic acid (1:1:1) with the highest &#945; value was the most efficient DES in extracting lignin from biomass. The pretreated biomass also showed an enhanced enzymatic saccharification yield owing to the decreased particle size of the biomass and reduced content of hemicellulose and lignin. During the pretreatment process of biomass using DESs, the extracted lignin could be recovered successfully, with a yield of up to 60% and purity of over 90%. The molecular weight of the extracted lignin was much lower than that of the native cellulolytic enzyme lignin. The DES used for pretreatment process could be also successfully reused with high recovery yield of DES and high retention of delignification capacity.","Oh, Yujin; Park, Saerom; Jung, Dahun; Oh, Kyeong Keun; Lee, Sang Hyun",Int. j. biol. macromol,231,12

Circulating through Facebook, Instagram, and YouTube, dystopian photos and videos of abandoned streets, plazas, and malls resonated with harrowing scenes of attacking hordes of zombies in the Netflix series Kingdeom (2019-2020), whose second season premiered when most Southeast Asian cities experienced lockdowns. Global news agencies reported on the unsettling anxiety about contagion from foreign migrants and tourists, from which, despite intensifying social tensions, many ‘developing’ or ‘emerging’ economies in Southeast Asia derive their vitality. If the scholarship about zombie narratives tends to focus on the docile, subjugated bodies of mass labour, critiques of neoliberal capitalism highlight their insatiable, irrational consumerism. In contrast, this article explores how the steep downturns from travel restrictions and citywide lockdowns to fight the outbreak have exposed the dependency of developmental state capitalism for its rapid pace of material growth not only on the flexibility of migrant labour but also on the contingency of speculative investment from overseas. Whereas state capitalism is typically understood to deploy its resources in protected industries and state-owned enterprises to consolidate its political rule, its use of authority now appears to centre on reducing market risk. The resilient temporality of the novel coronavirus has led to a new cyclical capitalist normalcy of surging, declining, and resurging infections, which governments have struggled to manage through varied forms of lockdown and quarantine such as Circuit Breakers (CB) in Singapore, Movement Control Orders (MCO) in Kuala Lumpur, and Enhanced Community Quarantines (ECQ) in Manila, with the failed aspiration of economic stability.","Gonzaga, Elmo",Cultural Studies,231,22

Newly implemented hygiene modalities due to the SARS-CoV­2 pandemic have changed medical aftercare and the rehabilitation process. The aim of this study was to evaluate the quality of rehabilitation under corona conditions. MATERIAL AND METHODS: An anonymous survey of adult cochlear implant patients was carried out by a non-standardized questionnaire. Demographics were analyzed and the quality of medical aftercare, speech therapy, technical aftercare, psychological support and the hygiene modalities were compared to previous rehabilitation stays. RESULTS: In total 109 patients completed the questionnaire. The quality of rehabilitation and individual therapy were rated as qualitatively similar or improved. The threat of the pandemic and fear of corona were rated unexpectedly high with 68% and 50%, respectively. The hygiene measures during the rehabilitation stay eased subjective fears at the same time. The majority of patients were annoyed by wearing face masks but visors, protection shields and social distancing were more tolerated. CONCLUSION: The implementation of the new hygiene modalities within the therapeutic rehabilitation setting was well-accepted by patients allowing access to auditory rehabilitation. A successful rehabilitation should ensure a fear-free environment by adhering to the necessary hygiene modalities.","Aschendorff, A; Arndt, S; Kröger, S; Wesarg, T; Ketterer, M C; Kirchem, P; Pixner, S; Hassepaß, F; Beck, R",HNO,231,26

Recent computational-experimental screenings have identified several existing drugs that could serve as effective inhibitors of the virus' main protease, Mpro, which is involved in gene expression and replication. Among these, ebselen (2-phenyl-1,2-benzoselenazol-3-one) appears to be particularly promising. Here, we examine, at a molecular level, the potential of ebselen to decrease Mpro activity. We find that it exhibits a distinct affinity for the catalytic region. Our results reveal a higher-affinity, previously unknown binding site localized between the II and III domains of the protein. A detailed strain analysis indicates that, on such a site, ebselen exerts a pronounced allosteric effect that regulates catalytic site access through surface-loop interactions, thereby inducing a reconfiguration of water hotspots. Together, these findings highlight the promise of ebselen as a repurposed drug against SARS-CoV-2.","Menéndez, Cintia A; Byléhn, Fabian; Perez-Lemus, Gustavo R; Alvarado, Walter; de Pablo, Juan J",Sci.

An essential component of this close relationship between the two is sex differences. Many autoimmune diseases, such as systemic lupus erythematous and multiple sclerosis, feature strikingly increased prevalence in females, whereas in contrast, infectious diseases, such as Ebola and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, affect more men than women. Therefore, there are fundamental aspects of metabolic homeostasis and immune functions that are regulated differently in males and females. This can be observed in sex hormone-immune interaction where androgens, such as testosterone, have shown immunosuppressive effects whilst estrogen is on the opposite side of the spectrum with immunoenhancing facilitation of mechanisms. In addition, the two sexes exhibit significant differences in metabolic regulation, with estrous cycles in females known to induce variability in traits and more pronounced metabolic disease phenotype exhibited by males. It is likely that these differences underlie both the development of metabolic and autoimmune diseases and the response to current treatment options. Sexual dimorphism in immunometabolism has emerged to become an area of intense research, aiming to uncover sex-biased effector molecules in the various metabolic tissues and immune cell types, identify sex-biased cell-type-specific functions of common effector molecules, and understand whether the sex differences in metabolic and immune functions influence each other during autoimmune pathogenesis. In this review, we will summarize recent findings that address these critical questions of sexual dimorphism in immunometabolism as well as their translational implications for the clinical management of autoimmune diseases.","Manuel, Robbie S J; Liang, Yun",Autoimmun Rev,231,16

Multivariable linear regression models were used to analyse the association between time to reach a high-level SI and time to the peak number of daily new cases. RESULTS: Our results identified four trajectories of response in the spread of COVID-19 based on when the response was initiated: before January 13, from January 13 to February 12, from February 12 to March 11, and the last stage-from March 11 (the day WHO declared a pandemic of COVID-19) on going. Governments' responses were upgraded with further spread of COVID-19 but varied substantially across countries. After the adjustment of SI level, geographical region and initiation stages, each day earlier to a high SI level (SI > 80) from the start of response was associated with 0.44 (standard error: 0.08, P < 0.001, R2 = 0.65) days earlier to the peak number of daily new case. Also, each day earlier to a high SI level from the date of first reported case was associated with 0.65 (standard error: 0.08, P < 0.001, R2 = 0.42) days earlier to the peak number of daily new case. CONCLUSIONS: Early start of a high-level response to COVID-19 is associated with early arrival of the peak number of daily new cases. This may help to reduce the delays in flattening the epidemic curve to the low spread level.","Ma, Yan; Mishra, Shiva Raj; Han, Xi-Kun; Zhu, Dong-Shan",Infect Dis Poverty,231,20

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to explore the role of internet hospitals during the prevention and control of the COVID-19 outbreak in China. METHODS: Online epidemic-related consultations from multicenter internet hospitals in China during the COVID-19 epidemic were collected. The counselees were described and classified into seven type groups. Symptoms were recorded and compared with reported patients with COVID-19. Hypochondriacal suspicion and offline visit motivation were detected within each counselees' group to evaluate the social panic of the epidemic along with the consequent medical-seeking behaviors. The counselees' motivation and the doctors' recommendation for an offline visit were compared. Risk factors affecting the counselees' tendency of hypochondriacal suspicion and offline visit motivation were explored by logistic regression models. The epidemic prevention and control measures based on internet hospitals were listed, and the corresponding effects were discussed. RESULTS: A total of 4913 consultations were enrolled for analysis with the median age of the counselees at 28 years (IQR 22-33 years). There were 104 (2.12%) healthy counselees, 147 (2.99%) hypochondriacal counselees, 34 (0.69%) exposed counselees, 853 (17.36%) mildly suspicious counselees, 42 (0.85%) moderately suspicious counselees, 3550 (72.26%) highly suspicious counselees, and 183 (3.72%) severely suspicious counselees. A total of 94.20% (n=4628) of counselees had epidemic-related symptoms with a distribution similar to those of COVID-19. The hypochondriacal suspicion (n=2167, 44.11%) was common. The counselees' motivation and the doctors' recommendation for offline visits were inconsistent (P<.001) with a Cohen kappa score of 0.039, indicating improper medical-seeking behaviors. Adult counselees (odds ratio [OR]=1.816, P<.001) with epidemiological exposure (OR 7.568, P<.001), shortness of breath (OR 1.440, P=.001), diarrhea (OR 1.272, P=.04), and unrelated symptoms (OR 1.509, P<.001) were more likely to have hypochondriacal suspicion. Counselees with severe illnesses (OR 2.303, P<.001), fever (OR 1.660, P<.001), epidemiological exposure history (OR 1.440, P=.01), and hypochondriacal suspicion (OR 4.826, P<.001) were more likely to attempt an offline visit. Reattending counselees (OR 0.545, P=.002) were less motivated to go to the offline clinic. CONCLUSIONS: Internet hospitals can serve different types of epidemic counselees, offer essential medical supports to the public during the COVID-19 outbreak, reduce the social panic, promote social distancing, enhance the public's ability of self-protection, correct improper medical-seeking behaviors, reduce the chance of nosocomial cross-infection, and facilitate epidemiological screening, thus, playing an important role on preventing and controlling COVID-19.","Gong, Kai; Xu, Zhong; Cai, Zhefeng; Chen, Yuxiu; Wang, Zhanxiang",J Med Internet Res,231,13

METHODS: We used TriNetX, a global health collaborative clinical research platform collecting real-time electronic medical records data, which has one of the largest known global COVID-19 database. We included patients with chronic autoimmune neuromuscular disorders (aNMD) [myasthenia gravis (MG), inflammatory myositis, and chronic inflammatory neuropathies (CIN)] and MS, based on the International Classification of Disease-10 (ICD-10) coding for one year before January 20th, 2020. We examined the use of IST, rate of COVID- 19, hospitalization, intubation, and mortality among the patients with aNMD and MS. RESULTS: A total of 33,451 patients with aNMD and 42,899 patients with MS were included. Among them, 111 (0.33%) patients with aNMD and 115 patients (0.27%) with MS had COVID-19. About one third of them required hospitalization. IST did not appear to have a significant impact on overall infection risk in either group; however, risk of hospitalization for immunosuppressed patients with aNMD was higher (Odds ratio 2.86, p-value 0.011). CONCLUSIONS: IST use does not appear to make patients with aNMD and MS more vulnerable to COVID-19. IST may be continued during the pandemic, as previously suggested by expert opinion guidelines. However, it is important to consider individualizing immunotherapy regimens in some cases. Additional physician reported registry-based data is needed to further confirm these findings.","Kovvuru, Sukanthi; Nalleballe, Krishna; Onteddu, Sanjeeva Reddy; Sharma, Rohan; Jasti, Madhu; Kapoor, Nidhi; Veerapaneni, Karthika; Yadala, Sisira; Dandu, Vasuki; Archer, Robert; Nowak, Richard J; Roy, Bhaskar",J Neurol Sci,231,22

While the COVID-19 illness is largely associated with respiratory consequences, there is increased reporting of other organ-specific disease sequelae that include the skin. OBJECTIVE: To identify, describe, and classify the main skin manifestations of COVID-19 and associated protocols for management. METHODS: Forty-five patients from three clinical centers in North and South America with positive COVID-19 PCR and/or serology presenting cutaneous manifestations were included in this retrospective chart review. Medical history, biopsies, dermoscopy, laboratory findings, clinical photography, and disease management were documented. RESULTS: Seven main types of cutaneous manifestations were identified: exanthema/molbilliform, urticaria, papular/pustular/vesicular, petechiae/purpura, livedo reticularis, chilblains, and alopecia. Histopathogical analysis from skin biopsies and/or dermoscopy highlighted an inflammatory or vascular pathophysiology depending on the type of manifestation. While the first three types of COVID-19 skin manifestations preceded or coincided with other symptoms such as anosmia, fever, chills, chilblains, and livedo were found in later disease stages. All cases had a positive resolution with appropriate treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Cutaneous symptoms are part of the COVID-19 disease spectrum. Early identification, diagnosis, and management through a multidisciplinary approach can facilitate safe disease resolution for patients.

ObjectiveThe aim of our study was to characterize functional humoral immunity (including memory B cell response) after COVID-19 mRNA vaccination and to determine/compare the reactivity of COVID-19 vaccine-induced memory B cells to the emerging SARS-CoV-2 Variants of Concern (VoC). Design, setting, participants and interventionsWe designed an exploratory longitudinal observational (convenience sample-based) study at Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN that enrolled and followed naive subjects and recovered COVID-19 subjects from Olmsted County, MN and surrounding areas after COVID-19 vaccination in January-June 2021. The study enrolled 17 relatively healthy subjects, 59% females and 94% White/Non-Hispanic or Latino with median age at enrollment 41 years. The subjects received either the BNT162b2 (Pfizer/BioNtech) or mRNA-1273 (Moderna) vaccine (n=3) and provided a blood sample at baseline, at [~]3 weeks after their first vaccine dose/before the second dose, and at [~]2 weeks after the receipt of their second vaccine dose. Main outcomes and measuresSpike-specific humoral and memory B cells responses were assessed over time after vaccination against the original Wuhan-Hu-1/vaccine and against emerging VoC strains/antigens. ResultsWe observed a robust neutralizing antibody response after COVID-19 mRNA vaccination, but a reduction in the functional antibody activity to several of the emerging SARS-CoV-2 VoC. Consistent with this, we also found differences in the number of isotype-switched/IgG+ MBCs responding to homologous and variant receptor-binding domain/RBDs after vaccination. We found a reduction of MBCs reactive to RBDs of Beta, Gamma and Delta SARS-CoV-2 VoC strains. Conclusion and relevanceIn this exploratory study in subjects following receipt of COVID-19 mRNA vaccine, we found differences in antibody titers observed for VoCs after vaccination that are accompanied with, and can partially be explained by, decreased MBC reactivity against the VoCs. This can further attenuate the generated recall humoral immune response upon exposure to these variants. Key PointsO_ST_ABSQuestionC_ST_ABSWhat is the reactivity of COVID-19 vaccine-induced memory B cells to the emerging SARS-CoV-2 Variants of Concern (VoC)? FindingsIn this longitudinal cohort study of subjects receiving COVID-19 mRNA vaccine we assessed memory B cell response and functional antibody titers. We found statistically significant differences between the frequencies of memory B cells responding to homologous and VoC receptor-binding domain/RBDs after vaccination. MeaningIn concert with the lowered antibody response, the reduced memory B-cell response to VoC could translate to an increased susceptibility to the emerging SARS-CoV-2 variant strains in the face of waning immunity.","Haralambieva, Iana H.; Monroe, Jonathon M.; Grill, Diane E.; Ovsyannikova, Inna G; Poland, Gregory A.; Kennedy, Richard B.",,231,20

So, the search for an effective and active option for the treatment of COVID-19 is still a big challenge. The Spike protein (S), RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), and Main protease (Mpro) are considered to be the primary therapeutic drug target for COVID-19. In this study we have screened the drugbank compound library against the Main Protease. But our search was not limited to just Mpro. Like other viruses, SARS-CoV-2, have also acquired unique mutations. These mutations within the active site of these target proteins may be an important factor hindering effective drug candidate development. In the present study we identified important active site mutations within the SARS-CoV-2 Mpro (Y54C, N142S, T190I and A191V). Further the drugbank database was computationally screened against Mpro and the selected mutants. Finally, we came up with the common molecules effective against the wild type (WT) and all the selected Mpro. The study found Imiglitazar, was found to be the most active compound against the wild type of Mpro. While PF-03715455 (Y54C), Salvianolic acid A (N142S and T190I), and Montelukast (A191V) were found to be most active against the other selected mutants. It was also found that some other compounds such as Acteoside, 4-Amino-N- {4-[2-(2,6-Dimethyl-Phenoxy)-Acetylamino]-3-Hydroxy-1-Isobutyl-5-Phenyl-Pentyl}-Benzamide, PF-00610355, 4-Amino-N-4-[2-(2,6-Dimethyl-Phenoxy)-Acetylamino]-3-Hydroxy-1-Isobutyl-5-Phenyl-Pentyl}-Benzamide and Atorvastatin were showing high efficacy against the WT as well as other selected mutants.

In fact, this expression represents a complex combination of three components: the shape of the epidemic curve, the social distancing measures and the reproduction number [Formula: see text]. Each component has its own history, each with a different history of control. Presenting the control of the epidemic as flattening the curve is in fact flattening the underlying natural-social complexity. The curve that needs to be flattened is presented as a bell-shaped curve, implicitly suggesting that the pathogen's spread is subject only to natural laws. The [Formula: see text] value, however, is, fundamentally, a metric of how a pathogen behaves within a social context, namely its numerical value is affected by sociopolitical influences. The jagged and erratic empirical curve of Covid-19 illustrates this. Although the virus has most likely infected only a small portion of the total susceptible population, it is clear its shape has changed drastically. This changing shape is largely due to sociopolitical factors. These include shifting formal laws and policies, shifting individual behaviors as well as shifting various other social norms and practices. This makes the course of Covid-19 curve both erratic and unpredictable.","Boumans, Marcel",Hist Philos Life Sci,231,20

To date, such a manipulation is realized mainly via spin-polarized current based on spin-transfer torque or spin-orbital torque effect. However, this scheme is energy-consuming and may produce massive Joule heating. To reduce energy dissipation and risk of heightened temperatures of skyrmion-based devices, an effective solution is to use electric field instead of current as stimulus. Here, we realize an electric-field manipulation of skyrmions in a nanostructured ferromagnetic/ferroelectrical heterostructure at room temperature via an inverse magneto-mechanical effect. Intriguingly, such a manipulation is non-volatile and exhibits a multi-state feature. Numerical simulations indicate that the electric-field manipulation of skyrmions originates from strain-mediated modification of effective magnetic anisotropy and Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction.

Within the parent-child dyad, the temporal coordination of signals indicates an attunement to each other's emotional states. Despite the ubiquity with which parents and their children watch screen media together, no study has investigated inter-subject synchronisation in father-child dyads during such a co-viewing activity. The present study examined whether fatherchild dyads would exhibit unique inter-subject synchronisation during co-viewing of narrative visual scenes that is unique to the dyad and hence would not be observed in control dyads (i.e. randomly paired signals). Hyperscanning fNIRS was used to record the prefrontal cortex (PFC) signals of 29 fathers and their preschool-aged children (11 girls, 18 boys) as each pair engaged in a typical activity of watching children's shows together. Three 1-min video clips from ""Brave"", ""Peppa Pig"" and ""The Incredibles"" were presented to each dyad and children's ratings of video positivity and familiarity were obtained afterwards. PFC activity was analysed according to four clusters: medial left, medial right, frontal left and frontal right clusters. Results from synchrony analyses demonstrated that true father-child dyads showed significantly greater inter-subject synchronisation than control dyads, especially in the medial left cluster during the emotionally arousing conflict scene. Dyads with older fathers displayed less synchrony and older fathers, compared to younger ones, were also found to exhibit greater activity in the frontal right cluster. These findings point to a unique inter-subject synchronisation that exists in father-child relationships during shared co-viewing of narrative scenes which could be potentially modulated by parental age.","Azhari, Atiqah; Bizzego, Andrea; Esposito, Gianluca",Soc. neurosci.

Accurate and reproducible delineation of the myocardium is crucial for accurate analysis of peak systolic and diastolic myocardial velocities. In addition to the conventionally available magnitude CMR data, 4D MVM also acquires three velocity-encoded phase datasets which are used to generate velocity maps. These can be used to facilitate and improve myocardial delineation. Based on the success of deep learning in medical image processing, we propose a novel automated framework that improves the standard U-Net based methods on these CMR multi-channel data (magnitude and phase) by cross-channel fusion with attention module and shape information based post-processing to achieve accurate delineation of both epicardium and endocardium contours. To evaluate the results, we employ the widely used Dice scores and the quantification of myocardial longitudinal peak velocities. Our proposed network trained with multi-channel data shows enhanced performance compared to standard U-Net based networks trained with single-channel data. Based on the results, our method provides compelling evidence for the design and application for the multi-channel image analysis of the 4D MVM CMR data.","Wu, Yinzhe; Hatipoglu, Suzan; Alonso-'Alvarez, Diego; Gatehouse, Peter; Firmin, David; Keegan, Jennifer; Yang, Guang",,231,16

Older adults are at higher risk of severe illness from the disease and face an increasingly ageist general population who misrepresent the pandemic as an older adult problem. We use the Theory of Planned Behavior framework to examine vaccine behavior intention. METHOD: A convenience sample (n = 583) of adults aged 60 and older in the United States participated in an online survey using vignettes. Hierarchical regression and analysis of covariance were used to test our model. RESULTS: Results suggest that perceived risk of the pandemic, general vaccine beliefs, and political affiliation influence respondents' attitude toward the vaccine. Respondents' attitudes toward the vaccine and their physician's recommendation help shape vaccine intention.

The study identifies salient dimensions of employer obligations such as safety assurance and of employee obligations such as personal protection. While employees emphasized the transactional contracts to protect their individual interests, the employers tried to balance the transactional and relational contracts. The study proposes a dynamic PC breach model that indicates contract breaches lead to varied responses through a complex interpretation process.

Due to its high rate of transmission the most favorable way of limiting the outbreak’s extent is by early diagnosis followed by isolation of the infected individuals. So far, the most widely used diagnosis methods are RT-qPCR which detects specific sequences of the viral RNA. Some other methods include serological tests and the recently introduced CRISPR-CAS-12 based assays. As of now, no specific therapeutic treatments are known for COVID-19 however the use of some broad-spectrum antiviral drugs and convalescent plasma therapy have demonstrated positive outcomes.

METHODS: 36 rats were allocated into two groups: control group (C) with 12 rats subjected to colonic ressectinon and primary anastomosis; colostomy group (CZ) with 24 rats subjected to the same procedure done in the group C, but complemented with a proximal-terminal colostomy. Anastomosis healing was evaluated at the 2nd and 7th post-operative days (PO) by the presence of anastomotic dehiscence and mucosal line, adhesions, bursting pressure, and histologic examination. RESULTS: There was no anastomotic dehiscence in the two groups. Adhesions were more intense in group C at the 7th PO. At both groups, the intestinal rupture was always on the anastomotic line at the 2nd PO; at the 7th PO, most of ruptures happened on the colonic zone out of the anastomotic line (100% of group C and 70% of group CZ). No significant difference was noticied in the other healing anastomotic variables. CONCLUSION: There is no difference in the healing of colonic anastomosis related to the presence or abscence of a proximal colostomy in rats.","Betim Paes Leme, Marcelo; Matos, Delcio; Ricardo de Oliveira Fernandes, Pedro; Maués da Serra-Freire, Nicolau",Acta cir. bras.,231,16

At this stage, fast, accurate and early clinical assessment of the disease severity is vital. To support decision making and logistical planning in healthcare systems, this study leverages a database of blood samples from 485 infected patients in the region of Wuhan, China, to identify crucial predictive biomarkers of disease mortality. For this purpose, machine learning tools selected three biomarkers that predict the mortality of individual patients more than 10 days in advance with more than 90% accuracy: lactic dehydrogenase (LDH), lymphocyte and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP). In particular, relatively high levels of LDH alone seem to play a crucial role in distinguishing the vast majority of cases that require immediate medical attention. This finding is consistent with current medical knowledge that high LDH levels are associated with tissue breakdown occurring in various diseases, including pulmonary disorders such as pneumonia. Overall, this Article suggests a simple and operable decision rule to quickly predict patients at the highest risk, allowing them to be prioritized and potentially reducing the mortality rate.","Yan, Li; Zhang, Hai-Tao; Goncalves, Jorge; Xiao, Yang; Wang, Maolin; Guo, Yuqi; Sun, Chuan; Tang, Xiuchuan; Jing, Liang; Zhang, Mingyang; Huang, Xiang; Xiao, Ying; Cao, Haosen; Chen, Yanyan; Ren, Tongxin; Wang, Fang; Xiao, Yaru; Huang, Sufang; Tan, Xi; Huang, Niannian; Jiao, Bo; Cheng, Cheng; Zhang, Yong; Luo, Ailin; Mombaerts, Laurent; Jin, Junyang; Cao, Zhiguo; Li, Shusheng; Xu, Hui; Yuan, Ye",Nat.

Based on the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), we defined four sequential immunotypes during recovery that correlated to various clinical parameters, including the level of respiratory support at concomitant sampling times. We identified classical monocytes as the first immune cell type to recover by restoration of HLA-DR-positivity and the reduction of immunosuppressive CD163 + monocytes, followed by the recovery of CD8 + and CD4 + T cell and non-classical monocyte populations. The identified immunotypes also correlated to aberrant cytokine and acute-phase reactant levels.

The relationship among implementation of mitigation strategies, case investigations, and contact tracing and COVID-19 incidence and associated hospitalization and mortality was examined during March-June 2020. Incidence declined by 82%, hospitalization by 88%, and mortality by 100% from late April to June 2020, as the mask mandate and contact tracing were added to case investigations and the stay-at-home order. Among 9,762 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases reported during March 11-June 25, 2020, two thirds (6,527; 67%) of patients were interviewed, and 5,823 (60%) reported completing isolation. Among 2,834 contacts reported, 882 (31%) were interviewed and among these contacts, 721 (82%) reported completing quarantine. Implementation of mitigation measures, including mandated mask use coupled with public health interventions, was followed by reductions in COVID-19 incidence and associated hospitalizations and mortality. The combination of state-mandated community mitigation efforts and routine public health interventions can reduce the occurrence of new COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations, and deaths.","Kanu, Florence A; Smith, Erica E; Offutt-Powell, Tabatha; Hong, Rick; Dinh, Thu-Ha; Pevzner, Eric",MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep,231,6

Retrospective studies, which have primarily been case reports and small case series, suggest that pneumothoraces may occur in 1-2% of patients with Covid-19. This potentially lethal complication is thought to more likely occur in mechanically ventilated patients and those with underlying lung disease. Our aim is to characterize the risk factor in patients hospitalized for Covid-19 who developed pneumothoraces. METHODS We conducted a retrospective chart review of patients with COVID-19 admitted at 5 hospitals within the Inova Health System between March 1, 2020 and May 21, 2020. Out of the 1619 hospitalized patients with Covid-19, 22 patients (1.4%) developed pneumothorax. Data on demographic, comorbidities, inflammatory markers, ventilatory mode and treatment methods were collected. Findings are displayed in Table 1. RESULTS The median length of stay was 18.5 days with the diagnosis of pneumothorax made between days 1 and 30 of hospitalization. All pneumothoraces were diagnosed on chest x-ray, with the most common reason for obtaining chest imaging being respiratory distress and worsening hypoxia. 10 patients developed left-sided pneumothorax, 11 patients developed right-sided pneumothorax and 1 patient developed bilateral pneumothoraces. 8 out of the 22 patients (36%) died, whereas the crude mortality of all patients admitted with Covid-19 during this time span was 15.8%. The median age of our cohort was 60 years and 82% were male. Majority of the patients were Latino. The most common comorbidities in this cohort included hypertension (52%) and diabetes (32%). Notably, only 19% of the patients had underlying lung pathology such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and asthma. Less than half of the patients who had pneumothoraces were ventilated. 16 (73%) patients had chest tubes placed for treatment. CONCLUSION The marked inflammatory response, fibrosis, and need for positive pressure ventilation in Covid-19 pneumonia are likely contributory to the development of pneumothorax. Unlike most cases of pneumothoraces, the etiology in patients with Covid-19 appears to be multifactorial and not directly associated with high vent settings. This is supported by the fact that many patients in our patients were on nasal cannula at time of diagnosis. Prompt diagnosis and treatment are crucial to mitigate morbidity and mortality in this population.","Podder, S.; Donthi, N.; Ekanem, E.; Desai, M.",American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine,231,26

Population studies have shown that lower cognitive function is associated with worse self-care abilities. Several guidelines have emphasized the importance of assessing cognitive function in older people with diabetes and tailoring treatment plan accordingly. Those guidelines do not specify which tools are the most appropriate for this population. One approach to delineate which tools should be used is to assess which tools best correlate with self-care capacity. Objective: To assess which cognitive assessment tools best correlate with self-care capacity in older people with type 2 diabetes. Methods: Cross-sectional study, conducted amongst individuals with diabetes over the age of 60. The association between self-care capacity indices and different cognitive assessment tools was examined. Principal Component self-care constructs were determined and the association between these and the different cognitive assessment tools was examined. Results: A significant association was found between the Principal Component self-care construct and the Montreal Cognitive Assessment and MindstreamsTM scores. In a stepwise regression model including only the Montreal Cognitive Assessment score, a significant association was found between this score and the Principal Component self-care construct. The same was not found in a model that included only the MindstreamsTM scores. Conclusions: The Montreal Cognitive Assessment, previously validated as a brief cognitive screening tool, may be useful as an adjunct to assess the self-care capacity of older individuals with diabetes. Future studies in the clinic are needed to evaluate if using this tool may improve treatment plans.","Mordenfeld, Nadia; Gayus, Noa; Azmon, Michal; Guri-Twito, Omri; Yahalom Peri, Tal; Natovich, Rachel; Cukierman-Yaffe, Tali",Front Endocrinol (Lausanne),231,30

Due to the global threat, many countries impose immediate lockdown. The impact of lockdown on the environmental pollutants and climate indicators gained considerable attention in the literature. This study aims to describe the variations in the environmental pollutants (CO, NO2, SO2, PM2.5 and PM10) with and without the lockdown period in the majorly hit states and provinces of the USA and China, respectively. Data during the first quarter year of 2019 and 2020 (lockdown period) was used in this study. Moreover, the effect of these pollutants on the pandemic spread was also studied. The results illustrated that the overall concentrations of CO, NO2 and PM2.5 were decreased by 19.28%, 36.7% and 1.10%, respectively, while PM10 and SO2 were increased by 27.81% and 3.81% respectively in five selected states of the USA during the lockdown period. However, in the case of chosen provinces of China, overall, the concentrations of all selected pollutants, i.e., CO, NO2, SO2, PM2.5 and PM10, were reduced by 26.53%, 38.98%, 18.36%, 17.78% and 37.85%, respectively. The COVID-19 reported cases and deaths were significantly correlated with NO2, PM2.5 and PM10 in both China and the USA. The findings of this study concluded that the limited anthropogenic activities in the lockdown situation due to this novel pandemic disease result in a significant improvement of air quality by reducing the concentrations of environmental pollutants. As the trend goes on, the reduction of most pollutant concentrations is expected as long as partial or complete lockdown goes on.Graphical abstract.","Shakoor, Awais; Chen, Xiaoyong; Farooq, Taimoor Hassan; Shahzad, Umer; Ashraf, Fatima; Rehman, Abdul; Sahar, Najam E; Yan, Wende",Air Qual Atmos Health,231,16

We reviewed clinical studies to clarify the obesity relationship with COVID-19 severity, comorbidities, and discussing possible mechanisms. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The electronic databases, including Web of Science, PubMed, Scopus, and Google Scholar, were searched and all studies conducted on COVID-19 and obesity were reviewed. All studies were independently screened by reviewers based on their titles and abstracts. RESULTS: Forty relevant articles were selected, and their full texts were reviewed. Obesity affects the respiratory and immune systems through various mechanisms. Cytokine and adipokine secretion from adipose tissue leads to a pro-inflammatory state in obese patients, predisposing them to thrombosis, incoordination of innate and adaptive immune responses, inadequate antibody response, and cytokine storm. Obese patients had a longer virus shedding. Obesity is associated with other comorbidities such as hypertension, cardiovascular diseases, diabetes mellitus, and vitamin D deficiency. Hospitalization, intensive care unit admission, mechanical ventilation, and even mortality in obese patients were higher than normal-weight patients. Obesity could alter the direction of severe COVID-19 symptoms to younger individuals. Reduced physical activity, unhealthy eating habits and, more stress and fear experienced during the COVID-19 pandemic may result in more weight gain and obesity. CONCLUSIONS: Obesity should be considered as an independent risk factor for the severity of COVID-19. Paying more attention to preventing weight gain in obese patients with COVID-19 infection in early levels of disease is crucial during this pandemic.","Aghili, Seyed Morsal Mosallami; Ebrahimpur, Mahbube; Arjmand, Babak; Shadman, Zhaleh; Pejman Sani, Mahnaz; Qorbani, Mostafa; Larijani, Bagher; Payab, Moloud",Int J Obes (Lond),231,16

In order to make informed public health choices, there is a need for tools which allow evaluation and comparison of DCT methods. We introduce an agent-based compartmental simulator we call COVI-AgentSim, integrating detailed consideration of virology, disease progression, social contact networks, and mobility patterns, based on parameters derived from empirical research. We verify by comparing to real data that COVI-AgentSim is able to reproduce realistic COVID-19 spread dynamics, and perform a sensitivity analysis to verify that the relative performance of contact tracing methods are consistent across a range of settings. We use COVI-AgentSim to perform cost-benefit analyses comparing no DCT to: 1) standard binary contact tracing (BCT) that assigns binary recommendations based on binary test results; and 2) a rule-based method for feature-based contact tracing (FCT) that assigns a graded level of recommendation based on diverse individual features. We find all DCT methods consistently reduce the spread of the disease, and that the advantage of FCT over BCT is maintained over a wide range of adoption rates. Feature-based methods of contact tracing avert more disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) per socioeconomic cost (measured by productive hours lost). Our results suggest any DCT method can help save lives, support re-opening of economies, and prevent second-wave outbreaks, and that FCT methods are a promising direction for enriching BCT using self-reported symptoms, yielding earlier warning signals and a significantly reduced spread of the virus per socioeconomic cost.","Gupta, Prateek; Maharaj, Tegan; Weiss, Martin; Rahaman, Nasim; Alsdurf, Hannah; Sharma, Abhinav; Minoyan, Nanor; Harnois-Leblanc, Soren; Schmidt, Victor; Charles, Pierre-Luc St.; Deleu, Tristan; Williams, Andrew; Patel, Akshay; Qu, Meng; Bilaniuk, Olexa; Caron, Ga'etan Marceau; Carrier, Pierre Luc; Ortiz-Gagn'e, Satya; Rousseau, Marc-Andre; Buckeridge, David; Ghosn, Joumana; Zhang, Yang; Scholkopf, Bernhard; Tang, Jian; Rish, Irina; Pal, Christopher; Merckx, Joanna; Muller, Eilif B.; Bengio, Yoshua",,231,16

Despite the action plans for prevention and control of surface water pollution in the basin, the desired results have not been achieved. However, the implementation of a nationwide lockdown due to the COVID-19 might probably lead to an improvement in the surface water quality. We evaluated the impact of the lockdown on water quality by measuring the levels of physico-chemical variables and metal(loid)s in water samples taken from 25 sampling stations in the basin. BOD, COD, EC, turbidity, TSS and Mn levels did not show significant differences between the pre-lockdown and lockdown periods due to the ongoing domestic wastewater discharges and agricultural activities in the basin during the lockdown period. However, Cr, Ni, Zn, Cu, As, Pb and Cd concentrations decreased considerably during the lockdown. Similarly, heavy metal pollution index and heavy metal evaluation index values showed a significant improvement in water quality of almost all stations during the lockdown period. Also, total hazard index values for children and adults reduced by 67% and 69%, respectively during the lockdown period, while total carcinogenic risk values for As and Cr reduced by 60% and 94%, respectively. The limited operational status of most industrial facilities in the basin during the lockdown reduced the amount of industrial effluents, leading to significant improvement in surface water quality for metal(loid)s. The lockdown has shown that the solution for preservation and sustainability of natural water resources lies in our hands, and the efficient management of pollution sources can prevent surface water pollution at a very rapid pace. Finally, we suggest that water management policy needs to be improved and implemented.","Tokatli, Cem; Varol, Memet",Environ Res,231,22

The objectives of the Predi-COVID study are (1) to identify new determinants of COVID-19 severity and (2) to conduct deep phenotyping of patients by stratifying them according to risk of complications, as well as risk factors for infection among household members of Predi-COVID participants (the Predi-COVID-H ancillary study). METHODS AND ANALYSIS: Predi-COVID is a prospective, hybrid cohort study composed of laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases in Luxembourg who will be followed up remotely for 1 year to monitor their health status and symptoms. Predi-COVID-H is an ancillary cohort study on household members of index cases included in Predi-COVID to monitor symptoms and household clusters in this high-risk population. A subcohort of up to 200 Predi-COVID and 300 Predi-COVID-H participants with biological samples will be included. Severity of infection will be evaluated by occurrence and duration of hospitalisation, admission and duration of stay in intensive care units or equivalent structures, provision of and duration of supplemental oxygen and ventilation therapy, transfer to another hospital, as well as the impact of infection on daily activities following hospital discharge.

Preventing infections and preserving resources and manpower are crucial in healthcare. It is important to ensure the ability of surgeons and specialized interventionalists to function through the pandemic. Until now, no justified protocol has been reported for the anesthetic management in cesarean section (CS). CASE REPORT A 29-year-old pregnant woman, G2P1 at 37+4 weeks of gestation, was referred to our center on March 28, 2020, after she had tested positive for COVID-19. She was stable and the CS was planned after she reached term. Through spinal anesthesia, CS was conducted. The anesthesia team was protected with full personal protection equipment. The operation was carried out smoothly without complication. A female neonate was delivered and was tested to be negative for COVID-19. No medical staff cross-infection was reported. CONCLUSIONS Special precautions should be considered when pregnant women are undergoing CS. Spinal anesthesia is preferred over general anesthesia.","Bani Hani, Diab A; Alsharaydeh, Ibrahim; Bataineh, Adel M; Al Athamneh, Mahmoud; Qamileh, Ibrahim; Al-Baik, Amin; Al Shalakhti, Majd H; Al-Ebbini, Mohammad A; Aleshawi, Abdelwahab J",Am J Case Rep,231,23

Factors influencing these parenting practices have not been examined in IPV-exposed Latinas. The aim of this study is to understand the factors that affect maternal involvement and spanking by Latinas to contribute to culturally-informed intervention development and refinement. A total of 93 Spanish-speaking Latinas who had experienced IPV completed standardized measures of maternal involvement, spanking, IPV, depression, and posttraumatic stress (PTS) and provided demographic information. Slightly over half of the women participated in an intervention program. Longitudinal multilevel modeling (MLM) demonstrated that higher levels of maternal depression predicted lower levels of involvement over time. PTS reexperiencing symptoms were positively related to involvement, such that mothers with higher levels of reexperiencing reported higher levels of involvement. An independent longitudinal MLM revealed that higher amounts of IPV exposure and higher levels of PTS arousal symptoms were associated with higher levels of spanking, while maternal employment was associated with lower levels of this same parenting behavior. Maternal involvement increased over time, where there was no significant change in spanking over time, and no effect of the intervention program on either parenting practice. Results suggest clinical interventions should target reductions in depression and specific PTS symptom subdomains as pathways to improving parenting in IPV-exposed Latinas. Continued study is needed to understand the relationship between reexperiencing and maternal involvement.","Stein, Sara F; Prakken, Kaitlin; Grogan-Kaylor, Andrew C; Galano, Maria M; Clark, Hannah M; Graham-Bermann, Sandra A",J Interpers Violence,231,20

Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) are considered first-line agents in patients with diabetes because of their nephroprotective effects, but administration of these drugs leads to upregulation of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is responsible for the viral entry of severe acute respiratory distress syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Data are lacking to determine what pulmonary effects ACEIs or ARBs may have in patients with diabetes, which could be relevant in the management of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2. This study aims to assess the prevalence of pulmonary adverse drug effects (ADEs) in patients with diabetes who were taking ACEI or ARBs to provide guidance as to how these medications could affect outcomes in acute respiratory illnesses such as SARS-CoV-2 infection. METHODS: 1DATA, a unique data platform resulting from collaboration across veterinary and human health care, used an intelligent medicine recommender system (1DrugAssist) developed using several national and international databases to evaluate all ADEs reported to the Food and Drug Administration for patients with diabetes taking ACEIs or ARBs. RESULTS: Mining of this data elucidated the proportion of a cluster of pulmonary ADEs associated with specific medications in these classes, which may aid health care professionals in understanding how these medications could worsen or predispose patients with diabetes to infections affecting the respiratory system, specifically COVID-19. Based on this data mining process, captopril was found to have a statistically significantly higher incidence of pulmonary ADEs compared with other ACEIs (P = 0.005) as well as ARBs (P = 0.012), though other specific drugs also had important pulmonary ADEs associated with their use. CONCLUSION: These analyses suggest that pharmacists and clinicians will need to consider the specific medication's adverse event profile, particularly captopril, on how it may affect infections and other acute disease states that alter pulmonary function, such as COVID-19.","Stafford, Emma G; Riviere, Jim E; Xu, Xuan; Kawakami, Jessica; Wyckoff, Gerald J; Jaberi-Douraki, Majid",J Am Pharm Assoc (2003),231,16

However, data concerning the epidemiological features, viral shedding, and antibody dynamics between asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 carriers and COVID-19 patients remain controversial. METHODS: We enrolled 193 SARS-CoV-2 infected subjects in Ningbo and Zhoushan, Zhejiang, China, from January 21 to March 6, 2020. All subjects were followed up to monitor the dynamics of serum antibody immunoglobulin M (IgM) and IgG against SARS-CoV-2 using colloidal gold-labeled and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. RESULTS: Of those, 31 were asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 carriers, 148 symptomatic COVID-19 patients, and 14 presymptomatic COVID-19 patients. Compared to symptomatic COVID-19 patients, asymptomatic carriers were younger and had higher levels of white blood cell and lymphocyte, lower level of C-reactive protein, and shorter viral shedding duration. Conversion of IgM from positive to negative was shorter in asymptomatic carriers than in COVID-19 patients (7.5 vs. 25.5 days, P = 0.030). The proportion of those persistently seropositive for IgG against SARS-CoV-2 was higher in COVID-19 patients than in asymptomatic carriers (66.1% vs. 33.3%, P = 0.037). Viral load was higher in symptomatic patients than presymptomatic patients (P = 0.003) and asymptomatic carriers (P = 0.004). Viral shedding duration was longer in presymptomatic COVID-19 patients than in asymptomatic carriers (48.0 vs. 24.0 days, P = 0.002). Asymptomatic carriers acquired infection more from intra-familial transmission than did COVID-19 patients (89.0% vs. 61.0%, P = 0.028). In 4 familial clusters of SARS-CoV-2 infection, asymptomatic carriers were mainly children and young adults while severe COVID-19 was mainly found in family members older than 60 years with comorbidities. CONCLUSION: Asymptomatic carriers might have a higher antiviral immunity to clear SARS-CoV-2 than symptomatic COVID-19 patients and this antiviral immunity should be contributable to innate and adaptive cellular immunity rather than humoral immunity. The severity of COVID-19 is associated with older age and comorbidities in familial clustering cases.","Chen, Yi; Li, Ping; Ding, Yibo; Liu, Miao; Liu, Leijie; Yi, Bo; Wu, Ting; Dong, Hongjun; Lao, Xuying; Ding, Keqing; Wang, Haibo; Zhang, Dongliang; Tan, Xiaojie; Wang, Zhongfa; Xu, Guozhang; Cao, Guangwen",J Infect Public Health,231,20

Here, we provide estimates of the potential effect of such short-term emission reductions on global and regional temperature and precipitation by analyzing the response of an Earth System Model to a range of idealized near-term emission pathways not considered in available model intercomparison projects. These estimates reveal the modest impact that temporary emission reductions associated with the COVID-19 pandemic will have on global and regional climate. Our simulations suggest that the impact of carbon dioxide and aerosol emission reductions is actually a temporary enhancement in warming rate. However, our results demonstrate that even large emission reductions applied for a short duration have only a small and likely undetectable impact.","Fyfe, J C; Kharin, V V; Swart, N; Flato, G M; Sigmond, M; Gillett, N P",Sci.

Two SO indices were TMM/TFM and ASM/TrFM. The Framingham model was used to calculate CVDR. Sex-specific mediation and moderation effects of bone indicators in the associations between the SO indices and the CVDR were analyzed. After adjusting for age, education, income, alcohol use, and physical activity, the SO indices inversely associated with the CVDR and TBM% inversely mediated those associations in both sexes. BMD inversely mediated those associations in men, while the mediation effects of BMD in women were non-significant or positive. In those aged &#8805; 60, the mediation effects were found in TBM% and BMD_LS , but not in BMD_FN.

However, clinicians often feel reluctant to trust AI-based models because of its black-box characteristic and lack of proper explainability. This paper proposes an explainable attention transfer classification model based on the knowledge distillation network structure to automatically differentiate COVID-19, community acquired pneumonia (CAP) from healthy lungs with radiographic imaging. The proposed network structure can be divided into teacher network and student network based on the attention transfer direction. Firstly, the teacher network extracts global features and concentrates on the infection regions to generate attention maps. We propose a deformable attention module (DAM) to strengthen infection regions response and suppress noise in irrelevant regions with expanded reception field. Moreover, combining essential information in original input, attention knowledge transfers from teacher network to student network via an image fusion module. Trained with teacher network jointly, the student branch with weighted dense connectivity can focus on irregularly shaped lesion regions to learn discriminative features and improve network performance. Comprehensive experiments have been conducted on public chest X-ray and CT imaging datasets. The proposed architecture achieves state-of-art performance and improves the AI-based model's explainable ability by attention map, severity assessment, and prediction confidence.","Shi, Wenqi; Tong, Li; Zhu, Yuanda; Wang, May Dongmei",IEEE j. biomed. health inform.

Globally, the impact of COVID-19 has been severe with more than half a million deaths over 6 months; in contrast, the HIV pandemic has resulted in over 32 million deaths worldwide over 40 years. This paper reviews the current epidemiology of COVID-19, summarizes its relationship to HIV, identifies synergies in our response, and suggests actions that can be taken to curtail the spread of COVID-19 among persons living with HIV (PLWH). Our understanding of the epidemiology, clinical presentation, prevention, and treatment of COVID-19 has evolved rapidly as they did with HIV. Epidemiologically, there are similarities between the two viruses including asymptomatic spread, disproportionate impact on persons of color, need for rapid diagnostic testing, and lack of a cure or vaccine. PLWH do not appear generally to have an increased incidence of COVID-19 infection or a more severe course of disease. Clinical trials to identify potential treatment and prevention options for COVID-19 have included antiretrovirals used to treat HIV that have not been efficacious. Public health responses overlap between the two pandemics including the need for behavior change and containment strategies such as contact tracing. As the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic evolves, the path forward to controlling, preventing, and treating COVID-19 can be informed by lessons learned from HIV as we seek to control the spread of both viral pandemics.","Castel, Amanda D; Wilbourn, Brittany; Magnus, Manya; Greenberg, Alan E",AIDS Rev,231,5

Effective treatments to mitigate this viral infection are needed. Since the eye is a route of virus entrance, we use an in vivo rat model of corneal inflammation as well as human corneal epithelial cells (HCEC) in culture challenged with IFNÎ³ as models of the eye surface to study this issue. We explore ways to block the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 Spike (S) protein to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). We found that the lipid mediators, elovanoid (ELV)-N32 or Resolvin D6-isomer (RvD6i) decreased the expression of the ACE2 receptor, furin, and integrins in damaged corneas or IFNÎ³-stimulated HCEC. There was also a concomitant decrease in the binding of Spike RBD with the lipid treatments. Using RNA-seq analysis, we uncovered that the lipid mediators also attenuated the expression of pro-inflammatoy cytokines participating in hyper-inflammation and senescence programming. Thus, the bioactivity of these lipid mediators will contribute to open therapeutic avenues to counteract virus attachment and entrance to the body.","Pham, Thang L; He, Jiucheng; Kakazu, Azucena H; Calandria, Jorgelina; Do, Khanh V; Nshimiyimana, Robert; Lam, Ting F; Petasis, Nicos A; Bazan, Haydee E P; Bazan, Nicolas G",Sci Rep,231,1

Preliminary research suggests the COVID-19 pandemic greatly disrupted these services and this population may be particularly susceptible to unemployment. OBJECTIVE: Describe employment and service disruptions for individuals with disabilities and chronic health conditions during the onset of community-based spread of COVID-19 in the United States. METHODS: Adults with disabilities and chronic health conditions completed online surveys to report employment and service changes via multiple choice and open-ended questions. Multiple choice questions were analyzed using descriptive statistics; open-ended responses were coded using content analysis. RESULTS: Participants (n = 109): 79.8% female, 88.1% white, 77.121% completed a 4-year college degree or greater, 61.4% had annual income &#8805;$45,000. Only 14.9% of survey respondents reported disruptions in employment. On average, 54.0% of service changes were due to discontinuation, including loss of physical therapy, job coaching, community organizations, transportation, and peer supports. Other changes included a shift to virtual service delivery and family members taking the role of service providers. CONCLUSIONS: Individuals with chronic health conditions and disabilities experienced service disruptions, even in a sample with considerably more economic, social, and educational privilege than the general population of people with chronic health conditions and disabilities in the United States.","Schwartz, Ariel E; Munsell, Elizabeth G S; Schmidt, Elizabeth K; Colón-Semenza, Cristina; Carolan, Kelsi; Gassner, Dena L",Disabil Health J,231,29

In order to curb the transmission and better managed the clusters, Malaysia imposed the Movement Control Order (MCO) which is now in its fourth phase. The MCO together with targeted screening have slowed the spread of COVID-19 epidemic.

However, it has several drawbacks, including long disinfection and ventilation times, excessive radiation effects, and high costs. While X-ray radiography is more useful for detecting COVID-19, it is insensitive to the early stages of the disease. We have developed inference engines that will turn X-ray machines into powerful diagnostic tools by using deep learning technology to detect COVID-19. We named these engines COV19-CNNet and COV19-ResNet. The former is based on convolutional neural network architecture; the latter is on residual neural network (ResNet) architecture. This research is a retrospective study. The database consists of 210 COVID-19, 350 viral pneumonia, and 350 normal (healthy) chest X-ray (CXR) images that were created using two different data sources. This study was focused on the problem of multi-class classification (COVID-19, viral pneumonia, and normal), which is a rather difficult task for the diagnosis of COVID-19. The classification accuracy levels for COV19-ResNet and COV19-CNNet were 97.61% and 94.28%, respectively. The inference engines were developed from scratch using new and special deep neural networks without pre-trained models, unlike other studies in the field. These powerful diagnostic engines allow for the early detection of COVID-19 as well as distinguish it from viral pneumonia with similar radiological appearances. Thus, they can help in fast recovery at the early stages, prevent the COVID-19 outbreak from spreading, and contribute to reducing pressure on health-care systems worldwide.","Keles, Ayturk; Keles, Mustafa Berk; Keles, Ali",Cognit Comput,231,1

We described barriers to accessing naloxone among individuals who requested and received the medication from a free mailed program and explored the relationship between how individuals with and without personal proximity to overdose learned about the program. METHODS: Secondary analysis of data from a web-based form collected 1st March 2020 to 31st January 2021. Access barriers, personal proximity to overdose (broadly defined as personally overdosing or witnessing/worrying about others overdosing), and method of learning about the program were categorized and described. RESULTS: Among 422 respondents, the most frequently reported barriers to accessing naloxone were: COVID quarantine (25.1%), lack of knowledge about access (13.2%), and cost (11.2%). Compared to those without personal proximity to overdose (38.2%), individuals with personal proximity (61.8%) heard about the program more often through an active online search (21.4% vs. 8.8%; p-value = 0.001) and less often through word of mouth (19.8% vs. 40.9%; p-value = <0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Longstanding barriers to naloxone access are compounded by the COVID-19 pandemic, making mailing programs especially salient. Differences in ways that individuals with and without personal proximity to substance use and overdose learned about this program can inform how such programs can effectively reach their target audience.","French, Rachel; Favaro, Jamie; Aronowitz, Shoshana V",Int J Drug Policy,231,1

PROCEDURE: AYA survivors ages 13-25 years were randomized to the intervention (eight in-person group sessions with mobile app and FitBit followed by 4 weeks of app and FitBit only) or waitlist control. Assessments were at 0, 2, 3, 6, and 9 months. Feasibility was evaluated by enrollment, retention, attendance, app engagement, and satisfaction. Secondary outcomes included physical activity, muscular strength/endurance, cardiorespiratory fitness, health-related quality of life, and fatigue. RESULTS: A total of 354 survivors were mailed participation letters; 68 (19%) were screened, of which 56 were eligible and 49 enrolled (88% of those screened eligible, 14% of total potentially eligible). Forty-nine survivors (Mage = 18.5 years, 49% female) completed baseline assessments and were randomized (25 intervention, 24 waitlist). Thirty-seven (76%) completed the postintervention assessment and 32 (65%) completed the final assessment. On average, participants attended 5.7 of eight sessions (range 1-8). Overall intervention satisfaction was high (M = 4.3, SD = 0.58 on 1-5 scale). Satisfaction with the companion app was moderately high (M = 3.4, SD = 0.97). The intervention group demonstrated significantly greater improvement in lower body muscle strength compared to the waitlist postintervention, and small but not statistically significant changes in other secondary measures. CONCLUSIONS: A group-based intervention with a mobile app and fitness tracker was acceptable but has limited reach due to geographical barriers and competing demands experienced by AYA survivors.","Devine, Katie A; Viola, Adrienne; Levonyan-Radloff, Kristine; Mackowski, Nicholas; Bozzini, Brittany; Chandler, Alexa; Xu, Baichen; Ohman-Strickland, Pamela; Mayans, Sherri; Farrar-Anton, Anne; Sahler, Olle Jane Z; Masterson, Margaret; Manne, Sharon; Arent, Shawn",Pediatr Blood Cancer,231,20

Here, we report that acetyl-coenzyme A (CoA) represents a critical mitochondrial signal to regulate aging through the chromatin remodeling and histone deacetylase complex (NuRD) in Caenorhabditis elegans Upon mitochondrial stress, the impaired tricarboxylic acid cycle results in a decreased level of citrate, which accounts for reduced production of acetyl-CoA and consequently induces nuclear accumulation of the NuRD and a homeodomain-containing transcription factor DVE-1, thereby enabling decreased histone acetylation and chromatin reorganization. The metabolic stress response is thus established during early life and propagated into adulthood to allow transcriptional regulation for life-span extension. Furthermore, adding nutrients to restore acetyl-CoA production is sufficient to counteract the chromatin changes and diminish the longevity upon mitochondrial stress. Our findings uncover the molecular mechanism of the metabolite-mediated epigenome for the regulation of organismal aging.","Zhu, Di; Wu, Xueying; Zhou, Jun; Li, Xinyu; Huang, Xiahe; Li, Jiasheng; Wu, Junbo; Bian, Qian; Wang, Yingchun; Tian, Ye",Sci.

High-resolution manometry (HRM) provides integrated relaxation pressure (IRP) which represents adequacy of LES relaxation. The Starlet HRM system is widely used in Japan; however, IRP values in achalasia/EGJOO patients assessed with the Starlet system have not been well studied. We propose the optimal cutoff of IRP for detecting achalasia/EGJOO using the Starlet system. METHODS: Patients undergone HRM test using the Starlet system at our institution between July 2018 and September 2020 were included. Of these, we included patients with either achalasia or EGJOO and those who had normal esophageal motility without hiatal hernia. Abnormally impaired LES relaxation (i.e., achalasia and EGJOO) was diagnosed if prolonged esophageal emptying was evident based on timed barium esophagogram (TBE). RESULTS: A total of 111 patients met study criteria. Of these, 48 patients were diagnosed with achalasia (n = 45 [type I, n = 20; type II, n = 22; type III, n = 3]) or EGJOO (n = 3). In the 48 patients who had a prolonged esophageal clearance based on TBE, IRP values distributed along a wide-range of minimal 14.1 to a maximal of 72.2 mmHg. The optimal cutoff value of IRP was 24.7 mmHg with sensitivity of 89.6% and specificity of 84.1% (AUC 0.94). CONCLUSION: The optimal cutoff value of IRP to distinguish achalasia/EGJOO was &#8805; 25 mmHg using the Starlet HRM system in our cohort.

METHODOLOGY: The present study employs Monte Carlo based transmission growth simulations for Italy, Germany and Turkey. The probabilities of transmission at home, work and social networks and the number of initial cases have been calibrated to match the basic reproduction number and the reported fatality curves. Parametric studies were conducted to observe the effect of social distancing, work closure, testing and quarantine of the family and colleagues of positively tested individuals. RESULTS: It is observed that estimates of the number of initial cases in Italy compared to Turkey and Germany are higher. Turkey will probably experience about 30% less number of fatalities than Germany due its smaller elderly population. If social distancing and work contacts are limited to 25% of daily routines, Germany and Turkey may limit the number of fatalities to a few thousands as the reproduction number decreases to about 1.3 from 2.8. Random testing may reduce the number of fatalities by 10% upon testing least 5/1000 of the population. Quarantining of family and workmates of positively tested individuals may reduce the total number of fatalities by about 50%. CONCLUSIONS: The fatality rate of Covid-19 is estimated to be about 1.5% based on the simulation results.

The new digital economy and its constantly evolving paradigm have completely transformed the model of doing business and the learning methods. MOOCs (massive-open-online-courses) and micro-credentials are the educations interfaces, have become an important teaching environment tool. Distance learning has become an indispensable alternative teaching method in updating and transferring classical education materials according to real-world settings, especially for learners in higher education. Aim. The current research is aimed to address the society's readiness and attitude direction to the concept of MOOCs and distance learning, highlighting its emergence and inevitability for educational institutions of all types in order to make a fundamental change in their curricula, especially in e-business courses, which are the most demanded training courses on MOOCs platforms. Methodology and research methods. In the study, the awareness and recognition of the online community on the MOOCs concept is examined. in this direction, Turkish people's perception and attitudes toward MOOCs have been addressed via sentiment analysis on Eksi Sozluk, the largest social communication and discussion platform in Turkey. Results. According to the sentiment analysis results, it has been determined that 52% of respondents have positive judgments on distance education and MOOCs, 29% of responses are neutral and 18% are negative. In general, distance education and MOOCs are perceived as a useful new education model by the Turkish people. Scientific novelty. This paper is the first sentiment analysis of learners' opinions on MOOCs and distance learning in Turkey. Considering the increasing awareness of MOOCs and the need for e-business education, as the most demanded type of MOOCs, this is the first study investigating the priority of these two phenomena within the context of COVID-19. Practical significance. It is thought that this study will contribute to the stakeholders in terms of showing how MOOCs and micro-credentials have a high potential to understanding trends in education especially in the new normal after the COVID-19 pandemic. The holistic education model of institutions has difficulty meeting the competitive nature and result-oriented approach of the e-business ecosystem. This market reality requires the institutions to offer more to-the-point and applied education solutions. In terms of e-business (e-commerce, digital marketing) education, the importance of MOOCs as a solution-focused on ""how"" rather than ""what."" has been comprehensively discussed in the paper.","Derindag, O.

This paper studies a new variation of this problem, called the Coverage Location Problem with Overlap Control (CLPOC). This problem models real contexts related to overloaded attendance systems, which require coverage zones with overlaps. Thus, each demand must be covered by a certain number of additional facilities to ensure that demands will be met even when the designated facility is unable to due to some facility issue. This feature is important in public and emergency services. We observe that this number of additional facilities is excessive in some demand points because overlaps among coverage zones occur naturally in CLP. The goal of the CLPOC is to control overlaps to prioritize regions with a high density population or to minimize the number of coverage zones for each demand point. In this paper, we propose a new mathematical model for the CLPOC that controls the overlap between coverage zones. We used a commercial solver to find the optimal solutions for available instances in the literature. The computational tests show that the proposed mathematical model found appropriate solutions in terms of number of demand points with minimum coverage zones and sufficient coverage zones for high demand points.","Araújo, Eliseu J.; Chaves, Antônio A.; Lorena, Luiz A.N.",Comput Ind Eng,231,16

This study builds on our prior study based on the scientific premise that YouTube is one of the most effective ways to communicate and mobilize the public in community mitigation to reduce exposure to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). OBJECTIVE: Because of the rapidly changing nature of YouTube in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, we conducted a follow-up study to document how coverage of preventive behaviors for effective community mitigation has changed. METHODS: A successive sampling design was used to compare coverage of behaviors to mitigate community transmission of COVID-19 in the 100 most widely viewed YouTube videos in January 2020 and March 2020. RESULTS: Videos in the January and March samples were viewed >125 million times and >355 million times, respectively. Fewer than half of the videos in either sample covered any of the prevention behaviors recommended by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, but many covered key prevention behaviors and were very widely viewed. There were no videos uploaded by entertainment television in the January sample, but this source comprised the majority of videos and garnered the majority of cumulative views in the March sample. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates the incredible reach of YouTube and the potential value of partnership with the entertainment industry for communicating and mobilizing the public about community mitigation to reduce mortality from the COVID-19 viral pandemic.","Basch, Charles E; Basch, Corey H; Hillyer, Grace C; Jaime, Christie",JMIR Public Health Surveill,231,20

These approaches restrict the mobility, social interactions, and daily activities of the affected individuals. In recent coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, quarantine and isolation are being adopted in many contexts, which necessitates an evaluation of global evidence on how such measures impact the mental health outcomes among populations. This umbrella review aimed to synthesize the available evidence on mental health outcomes of quarantine and isolation for preventing infectious diseases. METHODS: We searched nine major databases and additional sources and included articles if they were systematically conducted reviews, published as peer-reviewed journal articles, and reported mental health outcomes of quarantine or isolation in any population. RESULTS: Among 1,364 citations, only eight reviews met our criteria. Most of the primary studies in those reviews were conducted in high-income nations and in hospital settings. These articles reported a high burden of mental health problems among patients, informal caregivers, and healthcare providers who experienced quarantine or isolation. Prevalent mental health problems among the affected individuals include depression, anxiety, mood disorders, psychological distress, posttraumatic stress disorder, insomnia, fear, stigmatization, low self-esteem, lack of self-control, and other adverse mental health outcomes.

Due to this lockdown, individuals have been forced to find and use alternatives for accomplishing tasks including shopping, socializing, working, and finding information, and many have turned to the internet and their mobile devices. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to describe how South Africans consume and internalize information surrounding the COVID-19 outbreak in order to determine whether the COVID-19 lockdown and social isolation have influenced technology behavior, particularly in terms of health communication and information. METHODS: From June 24 to August 24, 2020, people in South Africa were invited to complete a survey through the Upinion mobile app, an online data collection resource. The survey collected information on demographics, and technology use during the lockdown, and COVID-19 knowledge. RESULTS: There were 405 participants, of which 296 (73.06%) were female. A total of 320 (79.01%) participants had a tertiary school education, 242 (59.75%) were single, and 173 (42.72%) had full-time employment. The lockdown forced 363 (89.63%) participants to use more technology, especially for work (n=140, 24.05%) and social media/communication (n=133, 22.85%). Security or privacy issues (n=46, 38.98%) and unfamiliarity with technology (n=32, 27.12%) were identified as the most common issues faced by the 127 (31.36%) participants who were unsure about using technology prior to the lockdown. Almost all participants (n=392, 96.79%) stated that they would continue using technology after the lockdown. Multimedia (n=215, 53.09%), mobile phone content (n=99, 24.44%), and health organizations and professionals (n=91, 22.47%) were the main sources of COVID-19 information. Most participants (n=282, 69.63%) felt that they had enough information. Two-thirds (n=275, 67.90%) of participants stated that they had used their mobile phones for health information before the lockdown, with web searches (n=109, 26.91%), social media (n=58, 14.32%), and government and institutional websites (n=52; 12.84%) serving as their main sources of information. Overall, the mean COVID-19 knowledge score was 8.8 (out of 10), and 335 (82.72%) had adequate knowledge (scored &#8805;8). Males were less likely to identify the correct transmission routes, and single participants were less likely to identify the signs and symptoms of the coronavirus. Tertiary school graduates were 4 times more likely to correctly identify the routes and 2 times more likely to identify how to stop the spread of the virus. People aged 43-56 years were 4 times more likely to identify how the coronavirus can be prevented, and participants &#8805;57 years were 2.6 times more likely to obtain a knowledge score of 10 when compared to those under 29 years of age. CONCLUSIONS: This study has shown that the COVID-19 lockdown has forced people to increase technology use, and people plan to continue using technology after the lockdown is lifted. Increased technology use was seen across a variety of fields; however, barriers including privacy, unfamiliarity, and data costs were identified. This population showed high COVID-19 knowledge, although the use of web searches and social media, instead of government and institutional websites, increases the potential for health misinformation to be spread.","Fischer, Alex Emilio; Van Tonder, Tanya; Gumede, Siphamandla B; Lalla-Edward, Samanta T",JMIR Form Res,231,1

This is seemingly related to a better replication of most respiratory viruses, including SARS-CoV-2, at lower-than-core body temperatures (i.e., 33 °C vs 37 °C). Also, intrinsic characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 make it a heat-susceptible pathogen. Thermotherapy has successfully been used to combat viral infections in plants which could otherwise result in great economic losses; 90% of viruses causing infections in plants are positive-sense single-stranded ribonucleic acid (+ssRNA) viruses, a characteristic shared by SARS-CoV-2. Thus, it is possible to envision the use of heat-based interventions (thermotherapy or mild-temperature hyperthermia) in patients with COVID-19 for which moderate cycles (every 8-12 h) of mild-temperature hyperthermia (1-2 h) have been proposed. However, there are potential safety and mechanistic concerns which could limit the use of thermotherapy only to patients with mild-to-moderate COVID-19 to prevent disease progression rather than to treat patients who have already progressed to severe-to-critical COVID-19. Here, we review the characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 which make it a heat-susceptible virus, potential host mechanisms which could be enhanced at higher temperatures to aid viral clearance, and how thermotherapy could be investigated as a modality of treatment in patients with COVID-19 while taking into consideration potential risks.","Mancilla-Galindo, Javier; Galindo-Sevilla, Norma",Int J Hyperthermia,231,29

While RNA is subject to the formation of similar lesions as DNA, the evolutionary and physiological impacts RNA lesions have on viral genomes are yet to be characterized. Lesions that may drive the evolution of RNA genomes can induce breaks that are repaired by recombination or can cause base substitution mutagenesis, also known as base editing. Over the past decade or so, base editing mutagenesis of DNA genomes has been subject to many studies, revealing that exposure of ssDNA is subject to hypermutation that is involved in the etiology of cancer. However, base editing of RNA genomes has not been studied to the same extent. Recently hypermutation of single-stranded RNA viral genomes have also been documented though its role in evolution and population dynamics.

Point-of-care tests not requiring laboratory- support will speed diagnosis and protect health-care staff. We studied the feasibility of using breath-analysis to distinguish these conditions with near-patient gas chromatography-ion mobility spectrometry (GC-IMS). Methods: Independent observational prevalence studies at Edinburgh, UK, and Dortmund, Germany, recruited adult patients with possible COVID-19 at hospital presentation. Participants gave a single breath-sample for VOC analysis by GC-IMS. COVID-19 infection was identified by transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT- qPCR) of oral/nasal swabs together with clinical-review. Following correction for environmental contaminants, potential COVID-19 breath-biomarkers were identified by multi-variate analysis and comparison to GC-IMS databases. A COVID-19 breath-score based on the relative abundance of a panel of volatile organic compounds was proposed and tested against the cohort data. Findings: Ninety-eight patients were recruited, of whom 21/33 (63.6%) and 10/65 (15.4%) had COVID-19 in Edinburgh and Dortmund, respectively. Other diagnoses included asthma, COPD, bacterial pneumonia, and cardiac conditions. Multivariate analysis identified aldehydes (ethanal, octanal), ketones (acetone, butanone), and methanol that discriminated COVID-19 from other conditions. An unidentified-feature with significant predictive power for severity/death was isolated in Edinburgh, while heptanal was identified in Dortmund. Differentiation of patients with definite diagnosis (25 and 65) of COVID-19 from non-COVID-19 was possible with 80% and 81.5% accuracy in Edinburgh and Dortmund respectively (sensitivity/specificity 82.4%/75%; area-under-the-receiver- operator-characteristic [AUROC] 0.87 95% CI 0.67 to 1) and Dortmund (sensitivity / specificity 90%/80%; AUROC 0.91 95% CI 0.87 to 1). Interpretation: These two studies independently indicate that patients with COVID-19 can be rapidly distinguished from patients with other conditions at first healthcare contact. The identity of the marker compounds is consistent with COVID-19 derangement of breath-biochemistry by ketosis, gastrointestinal effects, and inflammatory processes. Development and validation of this approach may allow rapid diagnosis of COVID-19 in the coming endemic flu seasons.

The variation in droplet volume, contact angle, ambient temperature, and humidity are considered. We analyze the chances of the survival of the virus present in the droplet based on the lifetime of the droplets under several conditions and find that the chances of the survival of the virus are strongly affected by each of these parameters. The magnitude of shear stress inside the droplet computed using the model is not large enough to obliterate the virus.

The absence of specific drugs and vaccines, the rapid transmission of the virus, and the increasing number of deaths worldwide necessitated the discovery of new substances for anti-COVID-19 drug development. With the aid of bioinformatics and computational modelling, ninety seven antiviral secondary metabolites from fungi were docked onto five SARS-CoV2 enzymes involved in viral attachment, replication, post-translational modification, and host immunity evasion infection mechanisms followed by molecular dynamics simulation and in silico ADMET prediction (absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion and toxicity) of the hit compounds. Thus, three fumiquinazoline alkaloids scedapin C (15), quinadoline B (19) and norquinadoline A (20), the polyketide isochaetochromin D1 (8), and the terpenoid 11a-dehydroxyisoterreulactone A (11) exhibited high binding affinities on the target proteins, papain-like protease (PLpro), chymotrypsin-like protease (3CLpro), RNA-directed RNA polymerase (RdRp), non-structural protein 15 (nsp15), and the spike binding domain to GRP78. Molecular dynamics simulation was performed to optimize the interaction and investigate the stability of the top-scoring ligands in complex with the five target proteins. All tested complexes were found to have dynamic stability.

Our starting hypothesis was that their use without periodic removal, cleaning or replacement for between 24 to 48 months after insertion is safe and effective. METHODS: This was a prospective observational and descriptive study. One hundred one women who successfully completed the 24 first months of continuous use of a ring pessary were included and monitored for another 24 months. The objectives were to establish the percentage of patients maintaining its use 48 months after insertion, the reasons for discontinuation and the adverse events. Another purpose of this study was to determine the timing of replacement of the vaginal pessary in long-term users. RESULTS: Of the women, 92.1% (93/101) had successful pessary use, and it was discontinued by three patients (2.9%, 3/101); 76.2% (77/101) of the women continued pessary use after the end of the study, and in 16 (15.8%, 16/101) patients, after pessary removal, the prolapse disappeared and did not recur. Forty-five women (48.4%, 45/93) presented some adverse events that required temporary pessary removal. The most common one was an increase in vaginal discharge (73.3%, 33/45). In four women (8.9%, 4/45), the ring pessary was detected embedded in the vaginal epithelium. CONCLUSIONS: Continuous use of a ring pessary can be recommended for 2 years in hysterectomized women and for 4 years in non-hysterectomized women if there are no complications.","Miceli, Alessio; Fernández-Sánchez, Manuel; Dueñas-Díez, José-Luis",Int Urogynecol J,231,1

Diagnosis, indication for POC testing, hospitalisation time, antimicrobial therapy and readmission or death within one month of testing were obtained from patient records.ResultsA valid indication for POC testing was established in 168 (93.3%) of children and 334 (89.1%) of adults. A positive POCT result significantly reduced antibiotic prescription and median hospitalisation time by 44.3 hours for adults and 14.2 hours for children, and significantly increased antiviral treatment in adults. Risk of readmission or death was not significantly altered by a positive result. Testing for 26 respiratory pathogens established that risk of coinfection is lower with increasing age and that POCT for adults should be restricted to the influenza and RSV season.ConclusionPositive POCT resulted in changed patient management for both children and adults, and was deemed safe. POCT for additional pathogens may be beneficial in children below 5 years of age and outside the influenza and RSV season.","Schneider, Uffe Vest; Holm, Mona Katrine Alberthe; Bang, Didi; Petersen, Randi Føns; Mortensen, Shila; Trebbien, Ramona; Lisby, Jan Gorm",Euro surveill,231,33

The lack of a clinically approved vaccine or drug remains the biggest bottleneck in combating the pandemic. Drug repurposing can expedite the process of drug development by identifying known drugs which are effective against SARS-CoV-2. The SARS-CoV-2 main protease is a promising drug target due to its indispensable role in viral multiplication inside the host. In the present study an E-pharmacophore hypothesis was generated using a crystal structure of the viral protease in complex with an imidazole carbaximide inhibitor. Drugs available in the superDRUG2 database were used to identify candidate drugs for repurposing. The hits obtained from the pharmacophore based screening were further screened using a structure based approach involving molecular docking at different precisions. The binding energies of the most promising compounds were estimated using MM-GBSA. The stability of the interactions between the selected drugs and the target were further explored using molecular dynamics simulation at 100 ns. The results showed that the drugs Binifibrate and Bamifylline bind strongly to the enzyme active site and hence they can be repurposed against SARS-CoV-2. However, U.S Food and Drug Administration have withdrawn Binifibrate from the market as it was having some adverse health effects on patients.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

Different from the existing Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Removed (SEIR) based virus transmission models, which fits well for pandemic modeling with sufficient historical data, the new model, which is also SEIR based, uses short history data to find the trend of the changing disease dynamics for the infected, the dead and the recovered so that it can naturally accommodate the adaptive real-time changes of disease mitigation, business activity and social behavior of populations. As the parameters of the improved SEIR models are trained by short history window data for accurate trend prediction, our differential epidemic model, essentially are window-based time-varying SEIR model. Since SEIR model still is a physics-based disease transmission model, its near-term (like one month) projection can still be very instrumental for policy makers to guide their decision for disease mitigation and business activity policy change in a real-time.

As a result, many cancer patients had their treatment deferred during the pandemic, increasing the time-to-treatment initiation, the number of untreated patients (which will alter the dynamics of healthcare delivery in the post-pandemic era) and increasing their risk of death. Hence, we analyzed the impact on global cancer mortality considering the decline in oncology care during the COVID-19 outbreak using head and neck cancer, a known time-dependent disease, as a model. METHODS: An online practical tool capable of predicting the risk of cancer patients dying due to the COVID-19 outbreak and also useful for mitigation strategies after the peak of the pandemic has been developed, based on a mathematical model. The scenarios were estimated by information of 15 oncological services worldwide, given a perspective from the five continents and also some simulations were conducted at world demographic data. RESULTS: The model demonstrates that the more that cancer care was maintained during the outbreak and also the more it is increased during the mitigation period, the shorter will be the recovery, lessening the additional risk of dying due to time-to-treatment initiation. CONCLUSIONS: This impact of COVID-19 pandemic on cancer patients is inevitable, but it is possible to minimize it with an effort measured by the proposed model.","Matos, Leandro L; Forster, Carlos Henrique Q; Marta, Gustavo N; Castro Junior, Gilberto; Ridge, John A; Hirata, Daisy; Miranda-Filho, Adalberto; Hosny, Ali; Sanabria, Alvaro; Gregoire, Vincent; Patel, Snehal G; Fagan, Johannes J; D039,; Cruz, Anil K; Licitra, Lisa; Mehanna, Hisham; Hao, Sheng-Po; Psyrri, Amanda; Porceddu, Sandro; Galloway, Thomas J; Golusinski, Wojciech; Lee, Nancy Y; Shiguemori, Elcio H; Matieli, José Elias; Shiguemori, Ana Paula A C; Diamantino, Letícia R; Schiaveto, Luiz Felipe; Leão, Lysia; Castro, Ana F; Carvalho, André Lopes; Kowalski, Luiz Paulo",Cancer Causes Control,231,16

In this sense, the establishment of culture environment, as oocyte incubation time, is essential for the success of the IVM. Therefore, the study was carried out to investigate the relationship between the meiotic potential and the IVM times of collared peccary oocytes, wild mammals of great commercial and ecological interest. Thus, ovaries were collected of females derived from captivity and transported to the laboratory within 1 hour of slaughtering. The oocytes derived from follicles (3-6mm in diameter) were recovered by aspirated and sliced. Good quality oocytes (evenly granulated cytoplasm with a least one layer of surrounding cumulus cells) were selected and subjected to culture in TCM 199 supplemented with 10µg/mL FSH, 10% FBS and 100µM cysteamine at 38.5°C, 5% CO2 and maximum humidity for 24 or 48 hours. After the incubation period, the nuclear status, the presence of first polar body and the expansion of cumulus cells of oocytes were assessed. The data obtained were analyzed by Fisher exact test (P<0.05). A total of four sessions (2-3 females per session) were performed, resulting in eighteen aspirated and sliced ovaries with normal morphological characteristics. An oocyte recovery rate of about 83.1% (59/71) was obtained with 3.3 oocytes/ovary and 2.3 viable oocytes/ovary. After different incubation times, differences (P<0.05) were observed in 24 and 48 hours for expansion of the cumulus cells (38.1% vs. 100%), presence of first polar body (52.4% vs. 90.5%) and nuclear status in second metaphase (19.0% vs. 76.2%), respectively. In conclusion, 48 hours is suitable time for the in vitro maturation of oocytes derived from collared peccaries when compared to the time of 24 hours, according to the meiotic potential observed. Additional studies should be conducted to improve the quality of the oocyte culture environment, as medium composition, aiming to obtain viable mature oocytes for other in vitro biotechnologies.(AU)","Borges, Alana A; Santos, Maria V.

However, our clinical experience supports ""awake"" epidural anaesthesia with sedation (EA + Sed) rather than EA + GA as a technique of choice for this type of surgery. METHODS: We used a standardised postoperative questionnaire to formally assess the experiences and outcomes for 50 patients who underwent free-flaps for LLOM under EA + Sed. FINDINGS: The mean duration of surgery was 522 min (8.7 h), range 240-875 min. There were no ITU admissions or flap failures. Postoperatively, fifty patients completed a standardised questionnaire about their experiences before the operation, in the anaesthetic room and theatre. 80% were aware of the procedure at least ""some of the time"". 72.5% patients and 75% respectively, did not have any concerns in the anaesthetic room and theatre. Concerns expressed by the remaining patients were manageable. 97.5% of those patients who recalled their operation reported their overall experience as ""comfortable"" or ""very comfortable"". 92% of respondents had undergone previous lower limb surgery under GA ± EA. In this subgroup, 91.3% reported the recovery after EA + Sed as ""quicker"" than GA, and 89.4% reported their experience with EA + Sed as ""better"". All fifty patients (100%) were ""satisfied"" or ""very satisfied"" with their experience and all but one (98%) would recommend this technique to others. CONCLUSIONS: Our study showed that despite prolonged duration, the patients' reported experiences and outcomes were excellent when EA + Sed was used for orthoplastic operations involving free-flaps for LLOM. We recommend EA + Sed as the anaesthetic technique of choice for such patients.","Galitzine, Svetlana; Wilson, Katy; Edington, Magdalena; Burumdayal, Amisha; McNally, Martin",Surg. (Edinb.),231,1

An acquired decrease of CR1 density on E from COVID-19 patients was observed (Mean = 418, SD = 162, N = 52) versus healthy individuals (Mean = 592, SD = 287, N = 400), Student's t-test p < 10-6, particularly among fatal cases, and in parallel with several parameters of clinical severity. Large deposits of C4d on E in patients were well above values observed in normal individuals, mostly without concomitant C3 deposits, in more than 80% of the patients. This finding is reminiscent of the increased C4d deposits on E previously observed to correlate with sub endothelial pericapillary deposits in organ transplant rejection, and with clinical SLE flares. Conversely, significant C3 deposits on E were only observed among » of the patients. The decrease of CR1/E density, deposits of C4 fragments on E and previously reported detection of virus spikes or C3 on E among COVID-19 patients, suggest that the handling and clearance of immune complex or complement fragment coated cell debris may play an important role in the pathophysiology of SARS-CoV-2. Measurement of C4d deposits on E might represent a surrogate marker for assessing inflammation and complement activation occurring in organ capillaries and CR1/E decrease might represent a cumulative index of complement activation in COVID-19 patients. Taken together, these original findings highlight the participation of complement regulatory proteins and indicate that E are important in immune pathophysiology of COVID-19 patients. Besides a potential role for monitoring the course of disease, these observations suggest that novel therapies such as the use of CR1, or CR1-like molecules, in order to down regulate complement activation and inflammation, should be considered.","Kisserli, Aymric; Schneider, Nathalie; Audonnet, Sandra; Tabary, Thierry; Goury, Antoine; Cousson, Joel; Mahmoudi, Rachid; Bani-Sadr, Firouze; Kanagaratnam, Lukshe; Jolly, Damien; Cohen, Jacques Hm",Immunobiology,231,31

At the same time, if we consider the University context, there is little attention paid during basic nursing education to emergency response, and faculty members report feeling poorly prepared to teach students about this topic. The present study aims to investigate how the Covid-19 pandemic condition influenced the psychological well-being of the Italian nursing students. METHODS: An online questionnaire was administered to Italian nursing students which contains two parts: a demographic section and the assessment to the psychological well-being nursing student with the Impact of Event Scale-Revised and the Patient Health Questionnaire-9. RESULTS: Given the emergency health situation from Covid-19, our initial concern was to find a large number of students with difficulties in mentally processing this situation even with problems such as depression, as their future profession is heavily involved in the management of this pandemic. Fortunately our results have denied our initial hypothesis since both the impact management levels of the event, assessed with the IES-R scale, and the depression levels, assessed with the PHQ-9 recorded values ââthat were almost normal. CONCLUSIONS: Nursing students are better able to face the situation since they find themselves in the role of spectators and not in the role of actors in the care of patients with Covid-19. If the training ameliorates psychological well being, therefore, it is necessary to provide and preserve nurses expertise to encourage teaching in nursing degree courses on maxi emergencies to prepare future nurses to face them adequately.","Vitale, Elsa; Moretti, Biagio; Noternicola, Angela; Covelli, Ilaria",Acta Biomed,231,20

OBJECTIVE. The purpose of this study was to investigate differences in CT manifestations of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pneumonia and those of influenza virus pneumonia. MATERIALS AND METHODS. We conducted a retrospective study of 52 patients with COVID-19 pneumonia and 45 patients with influenza virus pneumonia. All patients had positive results for the respective viruses from nucleic acid testing and had complete clinical data and CT images. CT findings of pulmonary inflammation, CT score, and length of largest lesion were evaluated in all patients. Mean density, volume, and mass of lesions were further calculated using artificial intelligence software. CT findings and clinical data were evaluated. RESULTS. Between the group of patients with COVID-19 pneumonia and the group of patients with influenza virus pneumonia, the largest lesion close to the pleura (i.e., no pulmonary parenchyma between the lesion and the pleura), mucoid impaction, presence of pleural effusion, and axial distribution showed statistical difference (p < 0.05). The properties of the largest lesion, presence of ground-glass opacity, presence of consolidation, mosaic attenuation, bronchial wall thickening, centrilobular nodules, interlobular septal thickening, crazy paving pattern, air bronchogram, unilateral or bilateral distribution, and longitudinal distribution did not show significant differences (p > 0.05). In addition, no significant difference was seen in CT score, length of the largest lesion, mean density, volume, or mass of the lesions between the two groups (p > 0.05). CONCLUSION. Most lesions in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia were located in the peripheral zone and close to the pleura, whereas influenza virus pneumonia was more prone to show mucoid impaction and pleural effusion. However, differentiating between COVID-19 pneumonia and influenza virus pneumonia in clinical practice remains difficult.","Lin, Liaoyi; Fu, Gangze; Chen, Shuangli; Tao, Jiejie; Qian, Andan; Yang, Yunjun; Wang, Meihao",AJR Am J Roentgenol,231,14

We hypothesized that endothelial damage may lead to substantially increased concentrations of von Willebrand factor with subsequent relative deficiency of a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with a thrombospondin type 1 motif, member 13 (ADAMTS13). DESIGN: Prospective controlled cross-over trial. SETTING: Blood samples of patients with confirmed coronavirus disease 2019 and healthy controls were obtained in three German hospitals and analyzed in a German hemostaseologic laboratory. PATIENTS: Seventy-five patients with confirmed coronavirus disease 2019 of mild to critical severity and 30 healthy controls. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: von Willebrand factor antigen, ADAMTS13, and von Willebrand factor multimer formation were analyzed. von Willebrand factor antigen was 4.1 times higher in COVID-19 patients compared with healthy controls (p < 0.0001), whereas ADAMTS13 activities were not significantly different (p = 0.18). The ADAMTS13/von Willebrand factor antigen ratio was significantly lower in COVID-19 than in the control group (24.4 ± 20.5 vs 82.0 ± 30.7; p < 0.0001). Fourteen patients (18.7%) undercut a critical ratio of 10 as described in thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura. Gel analysis of multimers resembled a thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura pattern with loss of the largest multimers in 75% and a smeary triplet pattern in 39% of the patients. The ADAMTS13/von Willebrand factor antigen ratio decreased continuously from mild to critical disease (analysis of variance p = 0.026). Furthermore, it differed significantly between surviving patients and those who died from COVID-19 (p = 0.001) yielding an area under the curve of 0.232 in receiver operating characteristic curve curve analysis. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 is associated with a substantial increase in von Willebrand factor levels, which can exceed the ADAMTS13 processing capacity resulting in the formation of large von Willebrand factor multimers indistinguishable from thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura. The ADAMTS13/von Willebrand factor antigen ratio is an independent predictor of severity of disease and mortality. These findings provide a rationale to consider plasma exchange as a therapeutic option in COVID-19 and to include von Willebrand factor and ADAMTS13 in the diagnostic workup.","Doevelaar, Adrian A N; Bachmann, Martin; Hölzer, Bodo; Seibert, Felix S; Rohn, Benjamin J; Bauer, Frederic; Witzke, Oliver; Dittmer, Ulf; Bachmann, Michael; Yilmaz, Serap; Dittmer, Rita; Schneppenheim, Sonja; Babel, Nina; Budde, Ulrich; Westhoff, Timm H",Crit Care Med,231,16

Umbilical cord mesenchymal stromal cells (UC-MSCs) influence proinflammatory T-helper 2 (Th2 ) cells to shift to an anti-inflammatory agent. To investigate efficacy of UC-MSC administration as adjuvant therapy in critically ill patients with COVID-19, we conducted a double-blind, multicentered, randomized controlled trial at four COVID-19 referral hospitals in Jakarta, Indonesia. This study included 40 randomly allocated critically ill patients with COVID-19; 20 patients received an intravenous infusion of 1 × 106 /kg body weight UC-MSCs in 100 ml saline (0.9%) solution (SS) and 20 patients received 100 ml 0.9% SS as the control group. All patients received standard therapy. The primary outcome was measured by survival rate and/or length of ventilator usage. The secondary outcome was measured by clinical and laboratory improvement, with serious adverse events. Our study showed the survival rate in the UC-MSCs group was 2.5 times higher than that in the control group (P = .047), which is 10 patients and 4 patients in the UC-MSCs and control groups, respectively. In patients with comorbidities, UC-MSC administration increased the survival rate by 4.5 times compared with controls. The length of stay in the intensive care unit and ventilator usage were not statistically significant, and no adverse events were reported. The application of infusion UC-MSCs significantly decreased interleukin 6 in the recovered patients (P = .023). Therefore, application of intravenous UC-MSCs as adjuvant treatment for critically ill patients with COVID-19 increases the survival rate by modulating the immune system toward an anti-inflammatory state.","Dilogo, Ismail Hadisoebroto; Aditianingsih, Dita; Sugiarto, Adhrie; Burhan, Erlina; Damayanti, Triya; Sitompul, Pompini Agustina; Mariana, Nina; Antarianto, Radiana D; Liem, Isabella Kurnia; Kispa, Tera; Mujadid, Fajar; Novialdi, Novialdi; Luviah, Evah; Kurniawati, Tri; Lubis, Andri M T; Rahmatika, Dina",Stem cells transl. med.

METHODS: Data collected routinely from people referred for cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) following hospitalization for COVID-19 were retrospectively analyzed. Persistent dyspnea was assessed using the modified Medical Research Council dyspnea scale. RESULTS: Twenty-three people with persistent symptoms were referred for CPET. Mean modified Medical Research Council dyspnea score was 1 (SD = 1) and was significantly associated with peak oxygen uptake (VO2peak; %) (rho = -0.49). At 6 months, those hospitalized in the general ward had a relatively preserved VO2peak (87% [SD = 20]), whereas those who had been in the intensive care unit had a moderately reduced VO2peak (77% [SD = 15]). Of note, the results of the CPET revealed that, in all individuals, respiratory equivalents were high, power-to-weight ratios were low, and those who had been in the intensive care unit had a relatively low ventilatory efficiency (mean VE/VCO2 slope = 34 [SD = 5]). Analysis of each individual showed that none had a breathing reserve <15% or 11 L/min, all had a normal exercise electrocardiogram, and 4 had a heart rate >90%. CONCLUSION: At 6 months, persistent dyspnea was associated with reduced physical fitness. This study offers initial insights into the mid-term physical fitness of people who required hospitalization for COVID-19. It also provides novel pathophysiological clues about the underlaying mechanism of the physical limitations associated with persistent dyspnea. Those with persistent dyspnea should be offered a tailored rehabilitation intervention, which should probably include muscle reconditioning, breathing retraining, and perhaps respiratory muscle training. IMPACT: This study is the first, to our knowledge, to show that a persistent breathing disorder (in addition to muscle deconditioning) can explain persistent symptoms 6 months after hospitalization for COVID-19 infection and suggests that a specific rehabilitation intervention is warranted.","Debeaumont, David; Boujibar, Fairuz; Ferrand-Devouge, Eglantine; Artaud-Macari, Elise; Tamion, Fabienne; Gravier, Francis-Edouard; Smondack, Pauline; Cuvelier, Antoine; Muir, Jean-François; Alexandre, Kevin; Bonnevie, Tristan",Phys. ther,231,1

Recently, a variant named lineage B.1.1.7 was detected and shown to be rapidly spreading across the UK since November 2020. As surveillance for these SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VOCs) becomes critical, we have investigated the use of environmental surveillance (ES) for the rapid detection and quantification of B.1.1.7 viruses in sewage as a way of monitoring its expansion that is independent on the investigation of identified clinical cases. Next-generation sequencing analysis of amplicons synthesized from sewage concentrates revealed the presence of B.1.1.7 mutations in viral sequences, first identified in a sample collected in London on 10 November 2020 and shown to rapidly increase in frequency to >95% in January 2021, in agreement with clinical data over the same period. We show that ES can provide an early warning of VOCs becoming prevalent in the population and that, as well as B.1.1.7, our method can detect VOCs B.1.351 and P.1, first identified in South Africa and Brazil, respectively, and other viruses carrying critical spike mutation E484K, known to have an effect on virus antigenicity. Although we did not detect such mutation in viral RNAs from sewage, we did detect mutations at amino acids 478, 490, and 494, located close to amino acid 484 in the spike protein structure and known to also have an effect on antigenicity. IMPORTANCE The recent appearance and growth of new SARS-CoV-2 variants represent a major challenge for the control of the COVID-19 pandemic. These variants of concern contain mutations affecting antigenicity, which raises concerns on their possible impact on human immune response to the virus and vaccine efficacy against them. Here, we show how environmental surveillance for SARS-CoV-2 can be used to help us understand virus transmission patterns and provide an early warning of variants becoming prevalent in the population. We describe the detection and quantification of variant B.1.1.7, first identified in southeast England in sewage samples from London (UK) before widespread transmission of this variant was obvious from clinical cases. Variant B.1.1.7 was first detected in a sample from early November 2020, with the frequency of B.1.1.7 mutations detected in sewage rapidly increasing to >95% in January 2021, in agreement with increasing SARS-CoV-2 infections associated with B.1.1.7 viruses.","Wilton, Thomas; Bujaki, Erika; Klapsa, Dimitra; Majumdar, Manasi; Zambon, Maria; Fritzsche, Martin; Mate, Ryan; Martin, Javier",mSystems,231,1

The purpose of this paper is to evaluate and gain important new insights of a group interviewing method with vulnerable people and their support group, adapted and transferred online during COVID-19. Design/methodology/approach: This research examines the experiences of 35 participants (nine family groups composed of parents and young people), involved in a research project that explores a sensitive topic, youth alcohol consumption and family communication, that was moved online during lockdown. Researcher reflections on running group interviews face-to-face prior to COVID- 19 and online during lockdown are included in the data. Findings: Thematic analysis of participant interviews and researcher reflections reveals four key benefits and three limitations of online group interviews with vulnerable people and their support group. The benefits include being comfortable, non-intrusive and safe; engaging and convenient; online communication ease and easy set-up. The limitations relate to lack of non-verbal communication, poor set-up, and privacy and access issues. Practical implications: The global environment is uncertain and being able to implement effective qualitative research online is essential for TSR and service research in the future. This paper provides a step by step procedure for an innovative online group interviewing technique that can be used by TSR and qualitative service researchers. Originality/value: Conducting research during a pandemic has provided unprecedented insights into qualitative research approaches and methodology. This paper contributes to literature on service and TSR methodology by providing a framework for researchers to investigate vulnerable groups online in an effective, safe and non-intrusive way. The framework also has the potential to be applied to other service contexts.","Dodds, Sarah; Hess, Alexandra Claudia",J. Serv. Manage.,231,1

We described events by PHA, number of contacts and exposure context.ResultsThe RKI processed 467 events, initiating contact to PHA 1,099 times (medianâ¯=â¯1; interquartile range (IQR): 1-2) and sharing data on 5,099 contact persons. Of 327 (70%) events with known exposure context, the most commonly reported exposures were aircraft (nâ¯=â¯64; 20%), cruise ships (nâ¯=â¯24; 7%) and non-transport contexts (nâ¯=â¯210; 64%). Cruise ship and aircraft exposures generated more contacts with authorities (medianâ¯=â¯10; IQR: 2-16, medianâ¯=â¯4; IQR: 2-11) and more contact persons (medianâ¯=â¯60; IQR: 9-269, medianâ¯=â¯2; IQR: 1-3) than non-transport exposures (medianâ¯=â¯1; IQR: 1-6 and medianâ¯=â¯1; IQR: 1-2). The median time spent on contact tracing was highest for cruise ships: 5 days (IQR: 3-9).ConclusionIn the COVID-19 pandemic, cross-border contact tracing is considered a critical component of the outbreak response. While only a minority of international contact tracing activities were related to exposure events in transport, they contributed substantially to the workload.

Elderly-onset RA can be assumed as a benign form of RA. Until recently, face-to-face therapeutic sessions between health professionals and patients are usually the method of its treatment. However, during pandemics, including coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), teletherapeutic sessions can extensively increase the patient safety especially in elderly patients who are more vulnerable to these infections. Thus, the aim of this study was to evaluate a novel teletherapy approach for management of elderly patients suffering from RA by utilizing laser acupuncture. METHODS: A teletherapy system was used for management of elderly patients suffering from RA. Sixty participants were allocated randomly into two groups and the ratio was 1:1. Patients in the first group were treated with laser acupuncture and telerehabilitation sessions, which consisted of aerobic exercise and virtual reality training. Patients in the second group received telerehabilitation sessions, which consisted of aerobic exercise and virtual reality training. Evaluation of patients was done by using the Health Assessment questionnaire (HAQ), the Rheumatoid Arthritis Quality of Life (RAQoL) questionnaire, and the analysis of interleukin-6 (IL-6), serum C-reactive protein (CRP), plasma adenosine triphosphate (ATP) concentration and plasma malondialdehyde (MDA). RESULTS: A statistically significant difference was found in CRP, RAQoL, IL-6 and MDA between the pre- and post-treatments in the first group (p < 0.05) favouring the post-treatment group, while the HAQ showed a statistically significant difference between pre- and post-treatments (p < 0.05) in both groups. Statistically significant post-treatment differences were also observed between the two groups (p < 0.05) in RAQoL, CRP, ATP and MDA, favouring the first group. DISCUSSION: Laser acupuncture teletherapy could be suggested as a reliable treatment method for elderly patients suffering from RA, as it can provide a safe and effective therapeutic approach. Teletherapy provided safer access to health professionals and patients while giving a high patient satisfaction value with a relatively lower cost (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04684693).","Adly, Aya Sedky; Adly, Afnan Sedky; Adly, Mahmoud Sedky; Ali, Mohammad F",J Telemed Telecare,231,12

The review assesses whether and how this COVID-19-focused research (i) examines components of an integrated system; (ii) accounts for interactions including complex, adaptive dynamics; and (iii) is oriented to informing action. It finds that this research to date has not comprehensively accounted for complex, coupled interactions, especially involving societal factors, potentially leading to erroneous conclusions and hampering efforts to draw broader insights across sustainability-relevant domains. Lack of systems perspective in COVID-19 research reflects a broader challenge in environmental research, which often neglects societal feedbacks.

The study objective was to describe differences in time from injury to arrival for patients with traumatic hip fractures admitted during the pandemic to pre-pandemic patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective cohort study at six level I trauma centers included patients with traumatic hip fractures. Patients with a non-fall mechanism and those who were transferred in were excluded. Patients admitted 16 March 2019-30 June 2019 were in the ""pre-pandemic"" group, patients were admitted 16 March 2020-30 June 2020 were in the ""pandemic"" group. The primary outcome was time from injury to arrival. Secondary outcomes were time from arrival to surgical intervention, hospital length of stay (HLOS), and mortality. RESULTS: There were 703 patients, 352 (50.1%) pre-pandemic and 351 (49.9%) during the pandemic. Overall, 66.5% were female and the median age was 82 years old. Patients were similar in age, race, gender, and injury severity score. The median time from injury to hospital arrival was statistically shorter for pre-pandemic patients when compared to pandemic patients, 79.5 (56, 194.5) min vs. 91 (59, 420), p = 0.04. The time from arrival to surgical intervention (p = 0.64) was statistically similar between groups. For both groups, the median HLOS was 5 days, p = 0.45. In-hospital mortality was significantly higher during the pandemic, 1.1% vs 3.4%, p = 0.04. CONCLUSIONS: While time from injury to hospital arrival was statistically longer during the pandemic, the difference may not be clinically important. Time from arrival to surgical intervention remained similar, despite changes made to prevent COVID-19 transmission.","Jarvis, Stephanie; Salottolo, Kristin; Madayag, Robert; Pekarek, Jennifer; Nwafo, Nnamdi; Wessel, Alexander; Duane, Therese; Roberts, Zachary; Lieser, Mark; Corrigan, Chad; Bar-Or, David",J Orthop Surg Res,231,29

However, the global epidemic of COVID-19 is worsening. We established a method to estimate the instant case fatality rate (CFR) and cure rate of COVID-19 in China. METHODS: A total of 82 735 confirmed cases released officially by the Chinese authorities from December 8, 2019 to April 18, 2020 were collected. The estimated diagnosis dates of deaths and cured cases were calculated based on the median cure time or median death time of individual cases. Following this, the instant CFR was calculated according to the number of deaths and cured cases on the same estimated diagnosis date. RESULTS: In China, the instant CFR of COVID-19 was 3.8-14.6% from January 1 to January 17; it then declined gradually and stabilized at 5.7% in April. The average CFR in China was 6.1±2.9%, while the CFR was 1.0±0.4% in China except Hubei Province. The cure rate of COVID-19 was 93.9±2.9% in China, and stabilized at 94.3%, while it was 99.0±0.4% in China except Hubei Province.

For detecting the prevalence of suicidal and self-harm ideation (SSI) and its related risk factors among hospital staff during the COVID-19 pandemic, this cross-sectional study collected the sociodemographic data, epidemic-related information, the psychological status and need, and perceived stress and support from 11507 staff in 46 hospitals by an online survey from February 14 to March 2, 2020. The prevalence of SSI was 6.47%. Hospital staff with SSI had high family members or relatives infected number and the self-rated probability of infection. Additionally, they had more perceived stress, psychological need, and psychological impact. On the contrary, hospital staff without SSI reported high self-rated health, willingness to work in a COVID-19 ward, confidence in defeating COVID-19, and perceived support.

In this study, national-specific and region-specific data sets from Germany, Italy, Spain and the United Kingdom were used to explore the effect of temperature, absolute humidity and diurnal temperature range (DTR) on COVID-19 transmission. From February 1st to November 1st, a 7-day COVID-19 case doubling time (Td), meteorological factors with cumulative 14-day-lagged, government response index and other factors were fitted in the distributed lag nonlinear models. The overall relative risk (RR) of the 10th and the 25th percentiles temperature compared to the median were 0.0074 (95% CI: 0.0023, 0.0237) and 0.1220 (95% CI: 0.0667, 0.2232), respectively. The pooled RR of lower (10th, 25th) and extremely high (90th) absolute humidity were 0.3266 (95% CI: 0.1379, 0.7734), 0.6018 (95% CI: 0.4693, 0.7718) and 0.3438 (95% CI: 0.2254, 0.5242), respectively. While the DTR did not have a significant effect on Td. The total cumulative effect of temperature (10th) and absolute humidity (10th, 90th) on Td increased with the change of lag days. Similarly, a decline in temperature and absolute humidity at cumulative 14-day-lagged corresponded to the lower RR on Td in pooled region-specific effects. In summary, the government responses are important factors in alleviating the spread of COVID-19. After controlling that, our results indicate that both the cold and the dry environment also likely facilitate the COVID-19 transmission.","Fu, Shihua; Wang, Bo; Zhou, Ji; Xu, Xiaocheng; Liu, Jiangtao; Ma, Yueling; Li, Lanyu; He, Xiaotao; Li, Sheng; Niu, Jingping; Luo, Bin; Zhang, Kai",Environ Res,231,11

We implemented a two-site orthopaedic trauma service, with 'COVID' and 'COVID-free' hubs, to deliver urgent and infection-controlled trauma care for hip fracture patients, while increasing bed capacity for medical patients during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: A vacated private elective surgical centre was repurposed to facilitate a two-site, 'COVID' and 'COVID-free', hip fracture service. Patients were screened for COVID-19 infection and either kept at our 'COVID' site or transferred to our 'COVID-free' site. We collected data for 30 days on patient demographics, Clinical Frailty Scale (CFS), Nottingham Hip Fracture Scores (NHFS), time to surgery, COVID-19 status, mortality, and length of stay (LOS). Results: In all, 47 hip fracture patients presented to our service: 12 were admitted to the 'COVID' site and 35 to the 'COVID-free' site. The 'COVID' site cohort were older (mean 86.8 vs 78.5 years, p = 0.0427) and with poorer CFS (p = 0.0147) and NHFS (p = 0.0023) scores. At the 'COVID-free' site, mean time to surgery was less (29.8 vs 52.8 hours, p = 0.0146), and mean LOS seemed shorter (8.7 vs 12.6 days, p = 0.0592). No patients tested positive for COVID-19 infection while at the 'COVID-free' site. We redirected 74% of our admissions from the base 'COVID' site and created 304 inpatient days' capacity for medical COVID patients. Conclusion: Acquisition of unused elective orthopaedic capacity from the private sector facilitated a two-site trauma service. Patients were treated expeditiously, while successfully achieving strict infection control. We achieved significant gains in medical bed capacity in response to the COVID-19 demand. The authors propose the repurposing of unused elective operating facilities for a two-site 'COVID' and 'COVID-free' model as a safe and effective way of managing hip fracture patients during the pandemic.Cite this article: Bone Joint Open 2020;1-6:190-197.","Chui, Karen; Thakrar, Amit; Shankar, Shivakumar",Bone Jt Open,231,5

With an emergence of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic, growing emphasis has been placed on the palliative needs of people with Parkinson's (PwP), particularly elderly, frail, and with comorbidities.Areas covered: The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic poses an enormous challenge on aspects of daily living in PwP and might interact negatively with a range of motor and non-motor symptoms (NMS), both directly and indirectly - as a consequence of pandemic-related social and health care restrictions. Here, the authors outline some of the motor and NMS relevant to PC, and propose a pragmatic and rapidly deployable, consensus-based PC approach for PwP during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, potentially relevant also for future pandemics.Expert opinion: The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic poses a considerable impact on PwP and their caregivers, ranging from mental health issues to worsening of physical symptoms - both in the short- and long-term, (Long-COVID) and calls for specific, personalized PC strategies relevant in a lockdown setting globally.

Friends, family, business colleagues, online contacts, and religious groups, for example, can all contribute to an individual's social life. Individuals may behave differently in different domains, but their success in one domain may nonetheless engender success in another. The complexity caused by distinct, but coupled, arenas of social interaction may be a key driver of prosocial or selfish behavior in societies. Here, we study this problem using multilayer networks to model a population with multiple domains of social interactions. An individual can appear in multiple different layers, each with separate behaviors and environments. We provide mathematical results on the resulting behavioral dynamics, for any multilayer structure. Across a diverse space of structures, we find that coupling between layers tends to promote prosocial behavior. In fact, even if prosociality is disfavored in each layer alone, multilayer coupling can promote its proliferation in all layers simultaneously. We apply these techniques to six real-world multilayer social networks, ranging from the networks of socio-emotional and professional relationships in a Zambian community, to the networks of online and offline relationships within an academic University. Our results suggest that coupling between distinct domains of social interaction is critical for the spread of prosociality in human societies.","Su, Qi; McAvoy, Alex; Mori, Yoichiro; Plotkin, Joshua B.",,231,8

RESULTS: We identified 40 SP in 71,904 patients with COVID-19 attending EDs(0.56, 95%CI=0.40-0.76). This relative frequency was higher than that of non-COVID patients(387/1,358,134, 0.28, 95%CI=0.26-0.32; OR=1.93, 95%CI=1.41-2.71). The standardized incidence of SP was also higher in COVID patients (34.2 versus 8.2/100,000/year; OR=4.19, 95%CI=3.64-4.81). Compared with COVID patients without SP, COVID patients developing SP more frequently had dyspnea and chest pain, low pulsioxymetry, tachypnea and increased leukocyte count. Compared to non-COVID patients with SP, cases differed in 19 clinical variables, the most prominent being a higher frequency of dysgeusia/anosmia, headache, diarrhea, fever and lymphopenia (all with OR>10). All the outcomes measured, including in-hospital death, were worse in cases than in both control groups. INTERPRETATION: SP as a form of COVID presentation at the ED is unusual (<1 cases) but is more frequent than in the non-COVID population and could be associated with worse outcomes than SP in non-COVID patients and COVID patients without SP.","Miró, Òscar; Llorens, Pere; Jiménez, Sònia; Piñera, Pascual; Burillo-Putze, Guillermo; Martín, Alfonso; Martín-Sánchez, Francisco Javier; García-Lamberetchs, Eric Jorge; Jacob, Javier; Alquézar-Arbé, Aitor; Mòdol, Josep Maria; López-Díez, María Pilar; Guardiola, Josep Maria; Cardozo, Carlos; Lucas Imbernón, Francisco Javier; Tejedo, Alfons Aguirre; García, Ángel García; Grinspan, Martín Ruiz; Roca, Ferran Llopis; González Del Castillo, Juan",Chest,231,26

One such regularity is the orientation anisotropy typical of natural scenes; most natural scenes contain slightly more canonical (horizontal and vertical) information than oblique information. This property is likely a primary cause of the oblique effect in which subjects experience greater perceptual fluency with horizontally and vertically oriented content than oblique. Recent changes in the visual environment, including the ""carpentered"" content in urban scenes and the framed, caricatured content in digital screen media presentations, may have altered the typical (natural) level of orientation anisotropy. The current work evaluated whether digital visual experience, or visual experience with framed digital content, has the potential to alter the magnitude of the oblique effect in visual perception. Experiment 1 successfully established a novel eye-tracking method capable of indexing the visual oblique effect quickly and reliably and demonstrated the oblique effect. Experiment 2 used this method and found that one session of exposure to a specific video game altered visual orientation perception. Taken together, these results indicate that exposure to the realistic, but caricatured scene statistics of digital screen media, can alter visual contour perception in one session.","Hipp, D; Olsen, S; Gerhardstein, P",Perception,231,26

We sought to assess the tolerance towards the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine in allergic patients. To address this issue, we used a questionnaire conducted on-line in a group of medical professionals who were vaccinated with the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine. A total of 1808 respondents, out of whom 1707 received two doses of the vaccine, returned the questionnaire. Local reactions after injection were more frequent in allergic individuals after both doses (swelling p = 0.0003). Systemic adverse events (AE-SYS) occurred more often after the second than the first dose in both groups (allergic persons: 77.29% vs. 41.06%);vomiting and arthralgia occurred more often in allergic subjects (p = 0.0009). AE-SYS in allergic individuals lasted longer than in non-allergic ones after the first (p = 0.01) and the second dose (p = 0.0009). Allergic reactions after vaccination were reported more frequently in allergic subjects: after the first dose (p = 0.00001) and after the second dose (p = 0.001). Rhinitis was the most frequent symptom observed more often in allergic patients. No severe allergic reactions occurred during the full cycle of vaccination. Although the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine is tolerated worse by allergic than non-allergic individuals, the occurring adverse symptoms are mild and do not preclude a successful completion of the vaccination cycle. The presence of symptoms suggestive of allergy does not constitute a condition of increased risk of developing clinically significant adverse events following Pfizer COVID-19 vaccination.","Nittner-Marszalska, Marita Rosiek-Biegus Marta Kopeć Agnieszka Pawłowicz Robert Kosińska Magdalena Łata Aleksandra Szenborn Leszek",Vaccines,231,16

The pathophysiology of such manifestations remains largely unknown. Objective: To perform a systematic clinical, histologic, and biologic assessment in a cohort of patients with chilblain-like lesions occurring during the COVID-19 pandemic. Design, Setting, and Participants: In this prospective case series carried out with a COVID-19 multidisciplinary consultation group at the University Hospital of Nice, France, 40 consecutive patients presenting with chilblain-like lesions were included. Main Outcomes and Measures: Patients underwent a thorough general and dermatologic examination, including skin biopsies, vascular investigations, biologic analyses, interferon-alpha (IFN-&#945;) stimulation and detection, and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and serologic analysis. Results: Overall, 40 consecutive patients with chilblain-like lesions were included. Most patients were young, with a median (range) age of 22 (12-67) years; 19 were male and 21 were female. The clinical presentation was highly reproducible with chilblain-like lesions mostly on the toes. Bullous and necrotic evolution was observed in 11 patients. Acrocyanosis or cold toes were reported in 19 (47.5%) cases. Criteria compatible with COVID-19 cases were noted in 11 (27.5%) within 6 weeks prior to the eruption. The real-time PCR (rt-PCR) testing results were negative in all cases. Overall, SARS-CoV-2 serology results were positive in 12 patients (30%). D-dimer concentration levels were elevated in 24 (60.0%) cases. Cryoglobulinemia and parvovirus B19 serologic results were negative for all tested patients. The major histologic findings were features of lymphocytic inflammation and vascular damage with thickening of venule walls and pericyte hyperplasia. A significant increase of IFN-&#945; production after in vitro stimulation was observed in the chilblain population compared with patients with mild-severe acute COVID-19. Conclusions and Relevance: Taken together, our results suggest that chilblain-like lesions observed during the COVID-19 pandemic represent manifestations of a viral-induced type I interferonopathy.

Graft delamination is primarily an imaging diagnosis and is confirmed with the help of ultrasound which shows the separation of graft fabric layers. Only two such cases have been described in the literature so far. CASE PRESENTATION: We present a case of upper extremity arteriovenous graft thrombosis in a 79 year old COVID-19 positive patient with end-stage renal disease. The diagnosis was established on ultrasonography which revealed separation of the graft fabric layers with thrombosis within the ""false"" and ""true"" lumen of the graft. The patient was managed with angioplasty and embolectomy of the clot material followed by stent-graft placement across the delaminated portion of the graft. Post-procedural angiography confirmed brisk flow across the graft and patient could successfully have subsequent hemodialysis sessions. CONCLUSIONS: Identification of graft delamination as a cause of graft failure is important as its management differs from other conventional causes since it requires stent-grafts to cover the area of delamination to re-establish flow and salvage the AV graft. The recognition of this phenomenon is essential to provide quality care and successful reuse of the AV graft.

Methods: We employed an ecological study design to study the correlation between demographics, healthcare availability, and COVID-19 indicators. Demographic and healthcare indicators were obtained from the Indonesian Health Profile of 2019 by the Ministry of Health while COVID-19 indicators were obtained from the Indonesian COVID-19 website in August 31st 2020. Non-parametric correlation and multivariate regression analyses were conducted with IBM SPSS 23.0. Results: We found the number of confirmed cases and case growth to be significantly correlated with demographic indicators, especially with distribution of age groups. Confirmed cases and case growth was significantly correlated (p < 0.05) with population density (correlation coefficient of 0.461 and 0.491) and proportion of young people (-0.377; -0.394). Incidence and incidence growth were correlated with ratios of GPs (0.426; 0.534), hospitals (0.376; 0.431), primary care clinics (0.423; 0.424), and hospital beds (0.472; 0.599) per capita. For mortality, case fatality rate (CFR) was correlated with population density (0.390) whereas mortality rate was correlated with ratio of hospital beds (0.387). Multivariate analyses found confirmed case independently associated with population density (ß of 0.638) and demographic structure (-0.289). Case growth was independently associated with density (0.763). Incidence growth was independently associated with hospital bed ratio (0.486). Conclusion: Pre-existing inequality of healthcare availability correlates with current reported incidence and mortality rate of COVID-19. Lack of healthcare availability in some provinces may have resulted in artificially low numbers of cases being diagnosed, lower demands for COVID-19 tests, and eventually lower case-findings.","Wirawan, Gede Benny Setia; Januraga, Pande Putu",Front Public Health,231,10

It includes many rights and plays an important role in the ""all-round development of man"" and its scope: physical, emotional, ethical, aesthetic, intellectual, professional, civic and international. The right to education is not the exclusive right of children. It is first and foremost the right of children and is essential for children's development. Therefore, it is generally accepted that educational opportunities should be equal for children. Unfortunately, the right to education has been severely curtailed in a short period of time due to the COVID -19 pandemic. According to UNESCO, 191 countries have temporarily closed national or local schools to contain the spread of COVID -19. This has resulted in school-age children being unable to receive basic education. This situation is particularly difficult for children from dysfunctional or disadvantaged families. Some families do not have internet, computers or books. Some parents cannot help them with homework because of educational or language limitations. All these unequal educational opportunities limit schooling. On the way to eliminate inequality in access to education and protect children from rights violations, the author will discuss whether Rawls' principle of fairness provides a good basis for the government to take action to eliminate unequal opportunities for education.","Preložnjak, Barbara PhD",EU and Comparative Law Issues and Challenges Series,231,14

Previously, we established that hydrogen-oxidizing bacteria (HOB) have the ability to remove orthophosphate from artificial surface water. In the present study, we expand the application of the HOB orthophosphate removal strategy (1) to treat artificial surface water with low initial orthophosphate concentrations, (2) to treat real surface water and real wastewater effluent, and (3) to remove orthophosphate continuously. For synthetic surface water, irrespective of the initial concentration of 0.7, 0.5, 0.3, and 0.1 mg PO43--P/L, ultra-low concentrations (0.0058 ± 0.0028 mg PO43--P/L) were obtained. When artificial surface water was replaced by real surface water, without added nutrients or other chemicals, it was shown that over 90% orthophosphate could be removed within 30 min of operation in a batch configuration (0.031 ± 0.023 mg PO43--P/L). In continuous operation, orthophosphate removal from surface water left an average concentration of 0.040 ± 0.036 for 60 days, and the lowest orthophosphate concentration measured was 0.013 mg PO43-/L. Simultaneously, nitrate was continuously removed for 60 days below 0.1 mg/L. The ability to remove orthophosphate even under nitrogen limiting conditions might be related to the ability of HOB to fix nitrogen. This study brings valuable insights into the potential use of HOB biofilms for nutrient remediation and recovery.","Barbosa, Raquel G; Oliveira, Felipe Candolo; Andrés-Torres, María; Sleutels, Tom; Verstraete, Willy; Boon, Nico",Sci Total Environ,231,16

Our goal was to identify risk factors associated with admission and disease severity in patients with SARS-CoV-2. DESIGN: This was an observational, retrospective study based on real-world data for 7,995 patients with SARS-CoV-2 from a clinical data repository. SETTING: Yale New Haven Health (YNHH) is a five-hospital academic health system serving a diverse patient population with community and teaching facilities in both urban and suburban areas. POPULATIONS: The study included adult patients who had SARS-CoV-2 testing at YNHH between March 1 and April 30, 2020. MAIN OUTCOME AND PERFORMANCE MEASURES: Primary outcomes were admission and in-hospital mortality for patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection as determined by RT-PCR testing. We also assessed features associated with the need for respiratory support. RESULTS: Of the 28605 patients tested for SARS-CoV-2, 7995 patients (27.9%) had an infection (median age 52.3 years) and 2154 (26.9%) of these had an associated admission (median age 66.2 years). Of admitted patients, 2152 (99.9%) had a discharge disposition at the end of the study period. Of these, 329 (15.3%) required invasive mechanical ventilation and 305 (14.2%) expired. Increased age and male sex were positively associated with admission and in-hospital mortality (median age 80.7 years), while comorbidities had a much weaker association with the risk of admission or mortality. Black race (OR 1.43, 95%CI 1.14-1.78) and Hispanic ethnicity (OR 1.81, 95%CI 1.50-2.18) were identified as risk factors for admission, but, among discharged patients, age-adjusted in-hospital mortality was not significantly different among racial and ethnic groups. CONCLUSIONS: This observational study identified, among people testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection, older age and male sex as the most strongly associated risks for admission and in-hospital mortality in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. While minority racial and ethnic groups had increased burden of disease and risk of admission, age-adjusted in-hospital mortality for discharged patients was not significantly different among racial and ethnic groups. Ongoing studies will be needed to continue to evaluate these risks, particularly in the setting of evolving treatment guidelines.","McPadden, Jacob; Warner, Frederick; Young, H Patrick; Hurley, Nathan C; Pulk, Rebecca A; Singh, Avinainder; Durant, Thomas J S; Gong, Guannan; Desai, Nihar; Haimovich, Adrian; Taylor, Richard Andrew; Gunel, Murat; Dela Cruz, Charles S; Farhadian, Shelli F; Siner, Jonathan; Villanueva, Merceditas; Churchwell, Keith; Hsiao, Allen; Torre, Charles J; Velazquez, Eric J; Herbst, Roy S; Iwasaki, Akiko; Ko, Albert I; Mortazavi, Bobak J; Krumholz, Harlan M; Schulz, Wade L",PLoS One,231,32

Fifth, vaccination benefits were seen in healthcare workers and nursing homes. Lastly, reinfections were more common. By Easter 2021, approximately 25% of the population in Madrid had been infected with SARS-CoV-2. Therefore, massive and accelerated vaccination campaigns are warranted to prevent new COVID-19 waves.","Soriano, Vicente; de Mendoza, Carmen; Gómez-Gallego, Felix; Corral, Octavio; Barreiro, Pablo",Int J Infect Dis,231,23

Cancer patients constitute a group that is expected to be at risk and poor prognosis in COVID pandemic. We aimed to investigate how cancer patients are affected by COVID-19 infection, its clinical course and the factors affecting mortality. METHODS: In our single-center retrospective study, we included cancer patients with laboratory confirmed COVID-19 in our hospital. Demographic, clinical, treatment, and laboratory data were obtained from electronic medical records. Logistic regression methods were used to investigate risk factors associated with in-hospital death. RESULTS: In the hospital, 4489 patients were hospitalized with COVID infection and 77 were cancer patients. The mean age of cancer patients was 61.9 ± 10.9 and 44 of them were male (62%). While the mortality rate in non-cancer patients was 1.51% (n = 68), this rate was significantly higher in cancer patients, 23.9% (n = 17). The stage of the disease, receiving chemotherapy in the last 30 days also lymphopenia, elevated troponin I, D-dimer, CRP, and CT findings were associated with severe disease and mortality. Severe lung involvement (OR = 22.9, p = 0.01) and lymphopenia (OR = 0.99, p = 0.04) are the most important factors influencing survival in logistic regression. CONCLUSIONS: The disease is more severe in cancer patients and mortality is significantly higher than non-cancer patients. These data show that it may be beneficial to develop dynamic prevention, early diagnosis and treatment strategies for this vulnerable group of patients who are affected by the infection so much.","Erdal, Gulcin Sahingoz; Polat, Ozlem; Erdem, Gokmen Umut; Korkusuz, Ramazan; Hindilerden, Fehmi; Yilmaz, Mesut; Yasar, Kadriye Kart; Isiksacan, Nilgun; Tural, Deniz",Int. j. clin. oncol,231,17

Accumulating evidence underscores the importance of facemasks, as worn by the general public, in limiting the spread of infection. Accordingly, mask wearing has become increasingly mandatory in public places such as stores and on public transit. Although the public has been generally adherent to mask wearing, a small but vocal group of individuals refuse to wear masks. Anti-mask protest rallies have occurred in many places throughout the world, sometimes erupting violently. Few empirical studies have examined the relationship between anti-mask attitudes and mask non-adherence and little is known about how such attitudes relate to one another or other factors (e.g., non-adherence to social distancing, anti-vaccination attitudes). To investigate these issues, the present study surveyed 2,078 adults from the US and Canada. Consistent with other surveys, we found that most (84%) people wore masks because of COVID-19. The 16% who did not wear masks scored higher on most measures of negative attitudes towards masks. Network analyses indicated that negative attitudes about masks formed an intercorrelated network, with the central nodes in the network being (a) beliefs that masks are ineffective in preventing COVID-19, and (b) psychological reactance (PR;i.e., an aversion to being forced to wear masks). These central nodes served as links, connecting the network of anti-masks attitudes to negative attitudes toward SARSCoV2 vaccination, beliefs that the threat of COVID-19 has been exaggerated, disregard for social distancing, and political conservatism. Findings regarding PR are important because, theoretically, PR is likely to strengthen other anti-masks attitudes (e.g., beliefs that masks are ineffective) because people with strong PR react with anger and counter-arguments when their beliefs are challenged, thereby leading to a strengthening of their anti-mask beliefs. Implications for improving mask adherence are discussed.","Taylorid, S.; Asmundson, G. J. G.",PLoS ONE,231,1

Perceived susceptibility and severity are considered key elements that motivate people to adopt nonpharmaceutical interventions. This study aimed to (i) explore perceived susceptibility and severity of the COVID-19 pandemic, (ii) examine the practice of nonpharmaceutical interventions, and (iii) assess the potential association of perceived COVID-19 susceptibility and severity with the practice of nonpharmaceutical interventions among people living in Afghanistan. METHODS: A cross-sectional design was used, using online surveys disseminated from April to May 2020. Convenience sampling was used to recruit the participants of this study. The previously developed scales were used to assess the participants' demographic information, perceived risk of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, and perceived severity of COVID-19. Multivariate analyses were conducted to assess the potential association of perceived COVID-19 susceptibility and severity with the practice of nonpharmaceutical interventions. RESULTS: The Internet was the main source for obtaining COVID-19 information among participants in this study. While 45.8% of the participants believed it was ""very unlikely"" for them to get infected with COVID-19, 76.7% perceived COVID-19 as a severe disease. Similarly, 37.5% believed the chance of being cured if infected with COVID-19 is ""unlikely/very unlikely."" The majority of participants (95.6%) perceived their health to be in ""good"" and ""very good"" status. Overall, 74.2% mentioned that they stopped visiting public places, 49.7% started using gloves, and 70.4% started wearing a mask. Participants who believed they have a low probability of survival if infected with COVID-19 were more likely to wear masks and practice hand washing. CONCLUSIONS: It appears that communities' psychological and behavioral responses were affected by the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic in Afghanistan, especially among young Internet users. The findings gained from a timely behavioral assessment of the community might be useful to develop interventions and risk communication strategies in epidemics within and beyond COVID-19.","Mousavi, Sayed Hamid; Delshad, Mohammad Hossein; Acuti Martellucci, Cecilia; Bhandari, Divya; Ozaki, Akihiko; Pourhaji, Fatemeh; Pourhaji, Fahimeh; Reza Hosseini, Sayed Mohammad; Roien, Rohullah; Ramozi, Abass Ali; Wafaee, Marzia; Qaderi, Shohra; Delsoz, Mohammad; Sigdel, Shailendra; Kotera, Yasuhiro; Sawano, Toyoaki; Dhama, Kuldeep; Rodríguez-Morales, Alfonso J; Wang, Jiwei; Tanimoto, Tetsuya; Yousefi, Ali Ahmad; Sah, Ranjit",Disaster Med Public Health Prep,231,16

Methods: This qualitative study involved semi-structured in-depth interviews with medical teachers categorized as healthy role models in a medical school from a previous survey. Ten medical teachers were selected using purposive sampling. Three medical teachers were interviewed by direct meetings, and the remaining were phone interviewed, with one interview facilitated by chat using WhatsApp. Transcribed interviews were coded openly. Themes were finalized through discussion and debate to reach a consensus. Results: Two themes were identified: perceived facilitators and perceived barriers, which were classified into four categories and 13 subcategories: intrinsic facilitators (motivation, conscious awareness, having physical limitations, knowledge, and economic reasons); extrinsic facilitators (the impact on doing a particular job, feedback, time, and environment); intrinsic barriers (the lack of self-motivation and having physical limitations); and extrinsic barriers (the burden of responsibilities for being medical teachers and environment). Conclusions: Factors that support and inhibit medical teachers as healthy role models in medical school are influenced by intrinsic and extrinsic factors. This result could be used by medical schools to design appropriate interventions to help medical teachers as healthy role models in conducting healthy behavior. More studies are needed to explore other factors that influence medical teachers to conduct healthy behavior.

In the current study, antibodies were investigated in patients recently diagnosed with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. METHODS: Cross-sectional data were obtained from 245 patients in whom SARS-CoV-2 infection had been confirmed via real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction between March and October 2020. Serum samples were acquired between 2 and 60 days following the onset of COVID-19 symptoms or the first detection of SARS-CoV-2 in asymptomatic patients. All specimens were tested simultaneously using an IgM/IgG rapid diagnostic test (RDT), IgG nucleocapsid protein-based chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay (CMIA), IgG, and IgA spike protein-based enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs). Blood donor samples obtained in 2018 were used as negative controls. RESULTS: The sensitivity and specificity of the RDT IgG were compared with the IgG immunoassays as standards. The RDT IgG exhibited 97.5% sensitivity and 89.4% specificity compared with a CMIA IgG, 98.4% sensitivity, and 78.8% specificity compared with an ELISA IgG. IgM, IgG, and IgA seropositivity rates were low between 1 and 2 weeks after COVID-19 symptom onset or the detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA. IgM seropositivity rate began decreasing after 4 weeks, whereas IgG and IgA seropositivity rate remained at appreciable levels over the 8-week study period. No cross-reactivity with seasonal coronaviruses was detected. CONCLUSIONS: IgG RDT alone or combined with molecular diagnostic tests may be useful for identifying recent SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Chansaenroj, Jira; Yorsaeng, Ritthideach; Posuwan, Nawarat; Puenpa, Jiratchaya; Sudhinaraset, Natthinee; Chirathaworn, Chintana; Poovorawan, Yong",Virol J,231,20

With regard to previously untreated patients with follicular lymphoma (FL), we sought to establish the prognostic significance of Trp catabolism in this disease. Serum Trp and Kyn levels in 110 patients with FL were quantified, and their relationship to different clinical parameters studied. IDO expression in the lymph nodes of affected patients was studied. Study participants included 54 males and 56 females (age range 39-86, median 62 years), showing a 5-year overall survival (OS) rate of 78.5%.

Multivariate analysis included the following 10 variables: age, sex, serum ß2-microglobulin, Hb, longest diameter of the largest involved node, Ann Arbor stage, serum lactate dehydrogenase, histologic grading, B symptoms, and serum Kyn/Trp ratio; a lower Hb level and a high Kyn/Trp ratio (HR, 3.239; 95% CI, 1.296-8.096) led to a significantly inferior OS. In the microenvironment, some CD11c-positive myeloid dendritic cells but not FL tumor cells were found to produce IDO. Overall, measuring levels of serum Kyn and Trp in individual patients with FL contributed to predicting their prognosis.","Masaki, Ayako; Ishida, Takashi; Maeda, Yasuhiro; Ito, Asahi; Suzuki, Susumu; Narita, Tomoko; Kinoshita, Shiori; Yoshida, Takashi; Ri, Masaki; Kusumoto, Shigeru; Komatsu, Hirokazu; Inagaki, Hiroshi; Ueda, Ryuzo; Choi, Ilseung; Suehiro, Youko; Iida, Shinsuke",Hematol. oncol,231,16

In order to re-open parts of society, policy-makers need to consider how combinations of measures will affect transmission and understand the trade-offs between them. We use age-specific social contact data, together with epidemiological data, to quantify the components of the COVID-19 reproduction number. We estimate the impact of social distancing policies on the reproduction number by turning contacts on and off based on context and age. We focus on the impact of re-opening schools against a background of wider social distancing measures. We demonstrate that pre-collected social contact data can be used to provide a time-varying estimate of the reproduction number (R). We find that following lockdown (when R = 0.7, 95% CI 0.6, 0.8), opening primary schools has a modest impact on transmission (R = 0.89, 95% CI 0.82-0.97) as long as other social interactions are not increased. Opening secondary and primary schools is predicted to have a larger impact (R = 1.22, 95% CI 1.02-1.53). Contact tracing and COVID security can be used to mitigate the impact of increased social mixing to some extent; however, social distancing measures are still required to control transmission. Our approach has been widely used by policy-makers to project the impact of social distancing measures and assess the trade-offs between them. Effective social distancing, contact tracing and COVID security are required if all age groups are to return to school while controlling transmission.

Understanding whether patient demand will last after the pandemic helps providers and payers make informed decisions about whether to continue adopting telemedicine. Objective: We examine user experience as well as process and patient outcomes of using telemedicine for acute conditions during COVID-19 and assess how patient outcomes are affected by waiting times and demographics. Materials and Methods: A survey was conducted via Amazon Mechanical Turk during June 17-29, 2020. Inclusion criteria were: (1) &#8805;18 years old, (2) residing in the United States, (3) used telemedicine for acute conditions after January, and 4) a human intelligence task approval rate of >95%. Process outcomes included patient waiting time with patient outcomes being satisfaction and future use intention. Bivariate analysis and regressions of the data were performed. Results: On average, respondents reported appointment wait time of 2.76 days and virtual office wait time of 19.44 min. Overall, respondents reported moderate satisfaction (mean 5.08-5.35 of 7) and future use intention (mean 5.10-5.32 of 7). Over 72% of the respondents were satisfied and had future use intention. Females, heavier internet users, and those on the higher/lower ends of the education spectrum reported better patient outcomes. Patients ""visiting"" a doctor experiencing eye problems, vis-à-vis other ailments, reported lower satisfaction and intention. Waiting time negatively associates with satisfaction. Conclusions: Given the satisfactory outcomes, the high demand for telemedicine may continue after the COVID-19 pandemic. However, whether providers will continue to offer telemedicine visits may require more evidence.","Kato-Lin, Yi-Chin; Thelen, Shawn T",Telemed. j. e. health,231,21

We herein report the first cases of C. auris infection from the American University of Beirut Medical Center, a tertiary care center in Lebanon describing the clinical features of the affected patients in addition to the infection control investigation and applied interventions to control the outbreak. Fourteen patients with C. auris infection/colonization identified using MALDI-TOF and VITEK 2- Compact system were reported over a period of 13 weeks. Patients were admitted to four separate critical care units. All of them came through the emergency room and had comorbid conditions. Half of the patients were infected with COVID-19 prior to isolation of the C. auris. C. auris was isolated from blood (two isolates), urine (three isolates), respiratory tract (10 isolates) and skin (one isolate). All the patients had received broad spectrum antibiotics prior to isolation of C. auris. Six patients received antifungal treatment, while the remaining eight patients were considered colonized. Environmental cultures were taken from all four units and failed to isolate the organism from any cultured surfaces. A series of interventions were initiated by the Infection Prevention and Control team to contain the outbreak. Rapid detection and reporting of cases are essential to prevent further hospital transmission. A national standardized infection control registry needs to be established to identify widespread colonization.","Allaw, Fatima; Kara Zahreddine, Nada; Ibrahim, Ahmad; Tannous, Joseph; Taleb, Hussein; Bizri, Abdul Rahman; Dbaibo, Ghassan; Kanj, Souha S",,231,24

OBJECTIVES: To assess the effectiveness of cloth and medical masks for preventing SARS-CoV-2 transmission in community settings. METHODS: Two rapid reviews were conducted searching three electronic databases (PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library) and two clinical trials registries on 30 and 31 March 2020. RESULTS: We screened 821 records and assessed nine full-text articles for eligibility. One and seven RCTs were included for cloth and medical mask reviews, respectively. No SARS-CoV-2-specific RCTs and no cloth mask RCTs in community settings were identified. A single hospital-based RCT provided indirect evidence that, compared with medical masks, cloth masks probably increase clinical respiratory illnesses (relative risk (RR) 1.56; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.98 - 2.49) and laboratory-confirmed respiratory virus infections (RR 1.54; 95% CI 0.88 - 2.70). Evidence for influenza-like illnesses (ILI) was uncertain (RR 13.00; 95% CI 1.69 - 100.03). Two RCTs provide low-certainty evidence that medical masks may make little to no difference to ILI infection risk versus no masks (RR 0.98; 95% CI 0.81 - 1.19) in the community setting. Five RCTs provide low-certainty evidence that medical masks may slightly reduce infection risk v. no masks (RR 0.81; 95% CI 0.55 - 1.20) in the household setting. CONCLUSIONS: Direct evidence for cloth and medical mask efficacy and effectiveness in the community is limited. Decision-making for mask use may consider other factors such as feasibility and SARS-CoV-2 transmission dynamics; however, well-designed comparative effectiveness studies are required.","Chetty, T; Ramokolo, V; Rees, K; Kredo, T; Balakrishna, Y; Mathews, C; Siegfried, N",S Afr Med J,231,20

The magnitude and speed of the shift to VCIs, the lack of existing research around bias and VCIs, and the underlying stress on all involved related to the pandemic put programs at risk of implementing virtual interviews without fully exploring their implications for diversity and equity. VCIs can promote diversity efforts by reducing the need for travel, making interviews more convenient and cost-effective for applicants. However, VCIs may also introduce new biases and amplify existing biases in recruitment. VCIs introduce a dependence on technology to conduct the interview process, which may amplify systemic inequities in access to broadband internet and high-quality hardware. Communication delays due to technology challenges may negatively affect interview scores. Additionally, users experience increased cognitive load when participating in videoconferences, which can activate implicit biases. Exposure to cues in the interviewee's personal living situation previously unavailable to interviewers may lead to unconscious assumptions by interviewers, which may also influence scoring. Graduate medical education programs committed to maintaining equitable recruitment processes must be able to recognize potential biases in VCIs and implement strategies to mitigate them. This article identifies some of the biases VCIs can introduce to the recruitment process and offers strategies for programs to mitigate them. These include making interviewers aware of potential technology-based inequities, encouraging interviewers to minimize multi-tasking, and offering guidance on use of standardized backgrounds. The authors also recognize the limitations of offering behavioral strategies to mitigate systemic inequities and suggest that structural changes are needed to ensure equitable access to technology.","Marbin, Jyothi; Hutchinson, Y-Vonne; Schaeffer, Sarah",Acad. med,231,16

Brief psychosocial therapy interventions provided by the primary care provider should be explored as an adjunct treatment for this population in the primary care setting.A pilot study was conducted to explore the integration of behavioral activation, a brief psychosocial intervention focused on decreasing depressed behavior by increasing nondepressed behavior to reinforce corresponding improvements in mood. Eligible patients were invited to attend five sessions once for five weeks. Visits were conducted according to the revised manual for Behavioral Activation Treatment for Depression. Data collection included measurements for adherence to treatment, PHQ-9, and BADS scores.Three primary aims were evaluated for this project: 1) To assess the feasibility of implementing this intervention in this clinic population;2) To decrease overall PHQ-9 scores and increase overall BADS scores;and 3) To increase medication adherence in conjunction with a psychosocial intervention.The feasibility evaluation of this project was performed according to Bowen's feasibility criteria and showed mixed results. Data suggests there was no statistically significant difference in depressive symptoms or daily functioning but minor improvements were noted, indicating potential clinical significance. Limitations of this study included low patient enrollment and the COVID-19 pandemic. Future research could include implementation of this intervention in an integrated care center, larger clinic, or with a different clinic population.

METHODS: We conducted a retrospective study to summarize the clinical practices of nonsevere patients with COVID-19 receiving the standard care, LPV/r or chloroquine in Beijing Ditan Hospital from January 20 to March 26, 2020. The main outcome measurements include the changes of cycle threshold values of open reading frame 1 ab (ORF1ab) and nucleocapsid (N) genes by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction assay from day 1 to 7 after admission for patients receiving standard care or after treatment being initiated for patients receiving either LPV/r or chloroquine. The proportion of developing severe illness, fever duration and the time from symptom onset to chest computer tomography improvement, and negative conversion of nucleic acid were compared. RESULTS: Of the 129 patients included in the study, 59 received the standard care, 51 received LPV/r, and 19 received chloroquine. The demographics and baseline characteristics were comparable among the 3 groups. The median duration of fever, median time from symptom onset to chest computer tomography improvement, and negative conversion of the nucleic acid were similar among the 3 groups. The median increase in cycle threshold values of N and ORF1ab gene for patients receiving LPV/r or chloroquine or the standard care during the treatment course was 7.0 and 8.5, 8.0, and 7.6, 5.0, and 4.0, respectively. These figures were not found significantly different among the 3 groups. CONCLUSIONS: Antiviral therapy using LPV/r or chloroquine seemed not to improve the prognosis or shorten the clinical course of COVID-19.","Gao, Guiju; Wang, Aibin; Wang, Sa; Qian, Fang; Chen, Meiling; Yu, Fengting; Zhang, Ju; Wang, Xudong; Ma, Xiaoyang; Zhao, Tianwei; Zhang, Fujie; Chen, Zhihai",J Acquir Immune Defic Syndr,231,24

Since the start of the pandemic, our increased understanding of transmission has facilitated the implementation of practices to promote patient and health care worker (HCW) safety. Simultaneously, there has been increasing recognition of the potential harm associated with delays in patient care, as well as inefficiency of endoscopy units. With widespread vaccination of HCWs and the general population, a re-evaluation of AGA's prior recommendations was warranted. In order to update the role of preprocedure testing for SARS-CoV2, the AGA guideline panel reviewed the evidence on prevalence of asymptomatic SARS-CoV2 infections in individuals undergoing endoscopy; patient and HCW risk of infections that may be acquired immediately before, during, or after endoscopy; effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccine in reducing risk of infections and transmission; patient and HCW anxiety; patient delays in care and potential impact on cancer burden; and endoscopy volumes. The panel considered the certainty of the evidence, weighed the benefits and harms of routine preprocedure testing, and considered burden, equity, and cost using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation framework. Based on very low certainty evidence, the panel made a conditional recommendation against routine preprocedure testing for SARS-CoV2 in patients scheduled to undergo endoscopy. The panel placed a high value on minimizing additional delays in patient care, acknowledging the reduced endoscopy volumes, downstream impact on delayed cancer diagnoses, and burden of testing on patients.","Sultan, Shahnaz; Siddique, Shazia M; Singh, Siddarth; Altayar, Osama; Caliendo, Angela M; Davitkov, Perica; Feuerstein, Joseph D; Kaul, Vivek; Lim, Joseph K; Mustafa, Reem A; Falck-Ytter, Yngve; Inadomi, John M",Gastroenterology,231,1

Should patients develop coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pneumonia requiring hospital admission for treatment of hypoxia, the risk for thromboembolic complications increases greatly. These thromboembolic events are the result of at least two distinct mechanisms - microvascular thrombosis in the pulmonary system (immunothrombosis) and hospital-associated venous thromboembolism. Since pregnancy is a prothrombotic state, there is concern regarding the potentially increased risk of thrombotic complications among pregnant women with COVID-19. To date, however, pregnant women do not appear to have a substantially increased risk of thrombotic complications related to COVID-19. Nevertheless, several organizations have vigilantly issued pregnancy-specific guidelines for thromboprophylaxis in COVID-19. Discrepancies between these guidelines reflect the altruistic wish to protect patients and lack of high-quality evidence available to inform clinical practice. Low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) is the drug of choice for thromboprophylaxis in pregnant women with COVID-19. However, its utility in non-pregnant patients is only established against venous thromboembolism, as LMWH may have little or no effect on immunothrombosis. Decisions about initiation and duration of prophylactic anticoagulation in the context of pregnancy and COVID-19 must take into consideration disease severity, outpatient vs inpatient status, temporal relation between disease occurrence and timing of childbirth, and the underlying prothrombotic risk conferred by additional comorbidities. There is currently no evidence to recommend the use of intermediate or therapeutic doses of LMWH in thromboprophylaxis, which may increase bleeding risk without reducing thrombotic risk in pregnant patients with COVID-19. Likewise, there is no evidence to comment on the role of low-dose aspirin in thromboprophylaxis or of anti-cytokine and antiviral agents in preventing immunothrombosis. These unanswered questions are being studied within the context of clinical trials.","D039,; Souza, Rohan; Malhamé, Isabelle; Teshler, Lizabeth; Acharya, Ganesh; Hunt, Beverley J; McLintock, Claire",Acta Obstet Gynecol Scand,231,20

This study assessed the influence of fruit colour and edge effect on the consumption of artificial fruits by frugivorous birds in three disturbed semideciduous forests in southeastern Brazil. In each of those areas, we performed a field experiment in which we placed artificial fruits of three different colours on plants and recorded their consumption by birds. Red-coloured fruits were ingested more often than yellow, but neither of them was consumed differently from dark-blue. Edge effect only affected consumption of yellow fruits. Our data neither support the hypothesis of preferential consumption of the highest contrasting colours nor of increased fruit consumption in the forest interior. These findings indicate that colour and edge effects, as well as the interaction between them, may not be strong predictors of fruit choice by birds in disturbed environments, especially because generalist species, which are less sensitive to the physical alterations in forests, are favoured in these areas.(AU)","Pires, Luís Paulo; Gonçalves, Vanessa Fonseca; Ferreira, Giancarlo Ângelo; Camelo, Flávio Roque Bernardes; Melo, Celine de",Acta Sci.

SUMMARY OF FINDINGS: The recurrence of infectious processes, associated with the severity of the condition and/or unusual profile of the infectious agent, always related to the age range of symptom onset, are the most important findings for suspected diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: Considering this scenario, immunity disorders should be part of the investigation carried out by the general pediatrician, whether they are the innate errors of immunity (primary immunodeficiencies) or secondary immunodeficiencies, so that the diagnosis is attained as early as possible and therapeutic measures are implemented, reducing the morbidity and mortality of these patients.","Barreto, Irma Cecília Douglas Paes; Barreto, Bruno Acatauassú Paes; Cavalcante, Erica Gomes do Nascimento; Condino Neto, Antonio",,231,12

OBJECTIVE: To determine the factors on hospital admission that are predictive of severe disease or death from COVID-19. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort analysis. SETTING: Five hospitals in the Maryland and Washington, DC, area. PATIENTS: 832 consecutive COVID-19 admissions from 4 March to 24 April 2020, with follow-up through 27 June 2020. MEASUREMENTS: Patient trajectories and outcomes, categorized by using the World Health Organization COVID-19 disease severity scale. Primary outcomes were death and a composite of severe disease or death. RESULTS: Median patient age was 64 years (range, 1 to 108 years); 47% were women, 40% were Black, 16% were Latinx, and 21% were nursing home residents. Among all patients, 131 (16%) died and 694 (83%) were discharged (523 [63%] had mild to moderate disease and 171 [20%] had severe disease). Of deaths, 66 (50%) were nursing home residents. Of 787 patients admitted with mild to moderate disease, 302 (38%) progressed to severe disease or death: 181 (60%) by day 2 and 238 (79%) by day 4. Patients had markedly different probabilities of disease progression on the basis of age, nursing home residence, comorbid conditions, obesity, respiratory symptoms, respiratory rate, fever, absolute lymphocyte count, hypoalbuminemia, troponin level, and C-reactive protein level and the interactions among these factors. Using only factors present on admission, a model to predict in-hospital disease progression had an area under the curve of 0.85, 0.79, and 0.79, at day 2, 4, and 7, respectively. LIMITATION: The study was done in a single health care system. CONCLUSION: A combination of demographic and clinical variables is strongly associated with severe COVID-19 disease or death and their early onset. The COVID-19 Inpatient Risk Calculator (CIRC), using factors present on admission, can inform clinical and resource allocation decisions.

Background The COVID-19 pandemic brought additional stress to families. The pandemic could be particularly difficult for parents experiencing parental burnout, a condition that involves four dimensions: an overwhelming sense of exhaustion, emotional distancing from the child, saturation or a loss of fulfillment with the parental role, and a sharp contrast between how parents used to be and how they see themselves now. Method A quasi-longitudinal research design was adopted, comparing two cross-sectional studies among Portuguese parents (N =?995), with an interval of 2?years between each wave of data collection. Participants were surveyed voluntarily through an online questionnaire located on the institutional web platform of the universities involved in the study. Multivariate analysis of covariance was used to take into account the associations among variables, alongside controlling the possible confounding effects. Results Parents have overall higher parental burnout scores in Wave 2 than Wave 1, with increased exhaustion, emotional distancing, and contrast, but decreased saturation. Although parental burnout levels remain higher for mothers across the two Waves, the growth is greater for fathers than for mothers. Conclusion Reconciling childcare with paid work is a stressful and new experience for many fathers. However, results suggest that even amid a crisis, some parents had the opportunity to deeply bond with their children. Implications We expect this work to encourage stakeholders to consider proper intervention strategies to address potential parental burnout. Also, initiatives that strengthen gender equity within parenting context are needed.","Aguiar, Joyce Matias Marisa Braz Ana Carolina César Filipa Coimbra Susana Gaspar Maria Filomena Fontaine Anne Marie",Family Relations,231,6

Steam disinfection of Legionella pneumophila [n=3;L. pneumophila serogroup 2-15 (wildtype environmental water isolate);L. pneumophila serogroup 1 NCTC11192 (reference strain);L. pneumophila serogroup 1 (wildtype environmental water isolate)], L. erythra (wildtype environmental water isolate) and L. bozemanii CRM11368M (reference strain) were examined in this study. Steam disinfection employing a baby bottle steam disinfector device eradicated all Legionella organisms tested. Steam disinfection, when performed properly under the manufacturer's instructions, offers a relatively inexpensive, simple, versatile and widely available technology for the elimination of Legionella species from contaminated showerheads. We therefore advocate the employment of such devices to regularly disinfect showerheads and shower tubing in hairdressing salons, barber shops and gyms, as a critical control in the elimination of these organisms from these sources, thereby enhancing customer/client/staff safety.","Millar, B.

Interferons (IFNs) are signalling molecules that mediate a variety of biological functions from defence against viral infections, to antitumor and immunomodulatory effects. These molecules have been classified into three major types: IFN I, IFN II, IFN III, presenting specific characteristics and functions. In this work, we reviewed the role of IFNs on AOSD and MAS, focusing on their pathogenic role in promoting the hyperinflammatory response and as new possible therapeutic targets. In fact, both preclinical and clinical observations suggested that these molecules could promote the hyperinflammatory response in MAS during AOSD. Furthermore, the positive results of inhibiting IFN-Î³ in primary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis may provide a solid rationale to arrange further clinical studies, paving the way for reducing the high mortality rate in MAS during AOSD.","Di Cola, Ilenia; Ruscitti, Piero; Giacomelli, Roberto; Cipriani, Paola",,231,10

There have been limited reports of co-infections accompanying SARS-CoV-2 infections, albeit lacking India specific study. The present study has made an effort toward elucidating the prevalence, diversity and characterization of co-infecting respiratory pathogens in the nasopharyngeal tract of SARS-CoV-2 positive patients. Two complementary metagenomics based sequencing approaches, Respiratory Virus Oligo Panel (RVOP) and Holo-seq, were utilized for unbiased detection of co-infecting viruses and bacteria. The limited SARS-CoV-2 clade diversity along with differential clinical phenotype seems to be partially explained by the observed spectrum of co-infections. We found a total of 43 bacteria and 29 viruses amongst the patients, with 18 viruses commonly captured by both the approaches. In addition to SARS-CoV-2, Human Mastadenovirus, known to cause respiratory distress, was present in a majority of the samples. We also found significant differences of bacterial reads based on clinical phenotype. Of all the bacterial species identified, ~60% have been known to be involved in respiratory distress. Among the co-pathogens present in our sample cohort, anaerobic bacteria accounted for a preponderance of bacterial diversity with possible role in respiratory distress. Clostridium botulinum, Bacillus cereus and Halomonas sp. are anaerobes found abundantly across the samples. Our findings highlight the significance of metagenomics based diagnosis and detection of SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory co-infections in the current pandemic to enable efficient treatment administration and better clinical management. To our knowledge this is the first study from India with a focus on the role of co-infections in SARS-CoV-2 clinical sub-phenotype.","Mehta, P.; Sahni, S.; Siddiqui, S.; Mishra, N.; Sharma, P.; Sharma, S.; Tyagi, A.; Chattopadhyay, P.; Vivekanand, A.; Devi, P.; Khan, A.; Waghdhare, S.; Budhiraja, S.; Uppili, B.; Maurya, R.; Nangia, V.; Shamim, U.; Hazarika, P.

Herein we demonstrated that lungs originated from different types of PF patients including coronavirus disease 2019, systemic sclerosis associated interstitial lung disease and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, and mice following bleomycin (BLM)-induced PF are characterized by the altered methyl-CpG-binding domain 2 (MBD2) expression in macrophages. Depletion of Mbd2 in macrophages protected mice against BLM-induced PF. Mbd2 deficiency significantly attenuated transforming growth factor ß1 (TGF-ß1) production and reduced M2 macrophage accumulation in the lung following BLM induction. Mechanistically, Mbd2 selectively bound to the Ship promoter in macrophages, by which it repressed Ship expression and enhanced PI3K/Akt signaling to promote macrophage M2 program. Therefore, intratracheal administration of liposomes loaded with Mbd2 siRNA protected mice from BLM-induced lung injuries and fibrosis. Together, our data support that MBD2 could be a viable target against pulmonary fibrosis in clinical settings.","Wang, Yi; Zhang, Lei; Wu, Guo-Rao; Zhou, Qing; Yue, Huihui; Rao, Li-Zong; Yuan, Ting; Mo, Biwen; Wang, Fa-Xi; Chen, Long-Min; Sun, Fei; Song, Jia; Xiong, Fei; Zhang, Shu; Yu, Qilin; Yang, Ping; Xu, Yongjian; Zhao, Jianping; Zhang, Huilan; Xiong, Weining; Wang, Cong-Yi",Sci.

We create a daily index of social distancing-at the state level-to capture social distancing beliefs by analyzing the number of tweets containing keywords such as ""stay home"", ""stay safe"", ""wear mask"", ""wash hands"" and ""social distancing"". We find that an increase in the Twitter index of social distancing on day t-1 is associated with a decrease in mobility on day t. We also find that state orders, an increase in the number of COVID-19 cases, precipitation and temperature contribute to reducing human mobility. Republican states are also less likely to enforce social distancing. Beliefs shared on social networks could both reveal the behavior of individuals and influence the behavior of others. Our findings suggest that policy makers can use geotagged Twitter data-in conjunction with mobility data-to better understand individual voluntary social distancing actions.","Porcher, Simon; Renault, Thomas",PLoS One,231,21

The return of an abducted child to the country of his or her habitual residence is challenged by travel restrictions, international border closures, quarantine measures, but also by closed courts or cancelled hearings. Those new circumstances that befell the whole world underline two issues considering child abduction proceedings. The first one considers access to justice in terms of a mere possibility of the applicant to initiate the return proceeding and, where the procedure is initiated, in terms of the manner of conducting the procedure. The legislation requires a quick initiation and a summary resolution of child abduction proceedings, which is crucial to ensuring the best interests and well-being of a child. This includes the obligation of the court to hear both the child and the applicant. Secondly, it is to be expected that COVID-19 will be used as a reason for child abduction and increasingly as justification for issuing non-return orders seen as a ""grave risk"" to the child under Article 13(1)(b) of the Child Abduction Convention. By analysing court practice from the beginning of the pandemic in March 2020 to March 2021, the research will investigate how the pandemic has affected child abduction proceedings in Croatia. Available national practice of other contracting states will also be examined. The aim of the research is to evaluate whether there were obstacles in accessing the national competent authorities and courts during the COVID-19 pandemic, and in which manner the courts conducted the proceedings and interpreted the existence of the pandemic in the context of the grave risk of harm exception. The analyses of Croatian and other national practices will be used to gain an overall insight into the effectiveness of the emerging guidance and suggest their possible broadening in COVID-19 circumstances or any other future crises.","Drventic, M.",Eu 2021 - the Future of the Eu in and after the Pandemic,231,26

CASE DESCRIPTION: A 75-year-old Japanese man was brought into our emergency department after receiving a left retroauricular stab wound by broken glass fragments. After spinal immobilization, a computed tomography (CT) scan revealed glass fragments penetrating at the right craniocervical junction to the interatlantooccipital subarachnoid space. CT angiography showed that both vertebral arteries were not injured. Magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated that the glass fragments did not penetrate the cervical cord or medulla oblongata. These glass fragments were removed via a midline incision from the external occipital protuberance to the C7 and with laminectomy without suboccipital craniectomy. Five of the glass fragments were found and removed in total. The dural defect was patched with a free fascia autograft. His postoperative course was uneventful. Postoperative CT angiography showed that both vertebral arteries were intact and the glass fragments had been removed completely. CONCLUSIONS: CT graphical diagnosis is useful for the management of penetrating craniocervical junction trauma, and it should be considered in the evaluation of patients who have suffered craniocervical penetrating injury even in the absence of major wounds or bleeding. Spinal immobilization of patients with craniocervical penetrating injuries is crucial to avoid not only secondary neurologic damage but also secondary critical vascular damage. Incomplete or inadequate assessment of craniocervical stab wounds results in unexpected hazards that are preventable.","Yoneoka, Yuichiro; Akiyama, Katsuhiko; Seki, Yasuhiro",World Neurosurg,231,16

BACKGROUND: A PCI is performed in about 25% of TAVR candidates, but procedural features and late outcomes of pre-TAVR PCI remain largely unknown. METHODS: Multicenter study including 1197 consecutive patients who had PCI in the work-up pre-TAVR. A total of 1,705 lesions (1.5 ± 0.7 lesions per patient) were included. Death, stroke, myocardial infarction, and major adverse cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events (MACCE) were recorded, as well as target lesion failure (TLF) and target vessel failure (TVF). RESULTS: Half of patients exhibited a multivessel disease and the mean SYNTAX (SYNergy between PCI with TAXUS and Cardiac Surgery) score was 12.1 ± 9.1. The lesions were of B2/C type, calcified, bifurcation, and ostial in 49.9%, 45.8%, 21.4%, and 19.3% of cases, respectively. After a median follow-up of 2 (interquartile range: 1 to 3) years, a total of 444 (37.1%) patients presented an MACCE. Forty patients exhibited TVF (3.3%), with TLF identified in 32 (2.7%) patients. By multivariable analysis, previous peripheral artery disease (p < 0.001), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (p = 0.002), atrial fibrillation (p = 0.003), diabetes mellitus (p = 0.012), and incomplete revascularization (p = 0.014) determined an increased risk of MACCE. In patients with unprotected left main or SYNTAX score >32 (n = 128), TLF, TVF, and MACCE rates were 3.9%, 6.3%, and 35.9%, respectively (p = 0.378; p = 0.065, and p = 0.847, respectively, vs. the rest of the population). CONCLUSIONS: Patients undergoing PCI in the work-up pre-TAVR frequently exhibited complex coronary lesions and multivessel disease. PCI was successful in most cases, and TLF and TVF rates at 2-year follow-up were low, also among patients with high-risk coronary features. However, overall MACCE occurred in about one-third of patients, with incomplete revascularization determining an increased risk. These results should inform future studies to better determine the optimal revascularization strategy pre-TAVR.","Faroux, Laurent; Campelo-Parada, Francisco; Munoz-Garcia, Erika; Nombela-Franco, Luis; Fischer, Quentin; Donaint, Pierre; Serra, Vicenç; Veiga, Gabriela; Gutiérrez, Enrique; Vilalta, Victoria; Alperi, Alberto; Regueiro, Ander; Asmarats, Lluis; Ribeiro, Henrique B; Matta, Anthony; Munoz-Garcia, Antonio; Armijo, German; Urena, Marina; Metz, Damien; Rodenas-Alesina, Eduard; de la Torre Hernandez, Jose Maria; Fernandez-Nofrerias, Eduard; Pascual, Isaac; Perez-Fuentes, Pedro; Arzamendi, Dabit; Campanha-Borges, Diego Carter; Del Val, David; Couture, Thomas; Rodés-Cabau, Josep",JACC cardiovasc. interv,231,1

METHODS: We compared 2020 ED visits before and during the COVID-19 pandemic, relative to 2019 visits in 108 EDs in 18 states in 115,716 adult ED visits with diagnoses for five serious cardiovascular conditions: ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), ischemic stroke (IS), hemorrhagic stroke (HS), and heart failure (HF). We calculated weekly ratios of ED visits in 2020 to visits in 2019 in the pre-pandemic (Jan 1-March 10), early-pandemic (March 11-April 21), and later-pandemic (April 22-October 31) periods. RESULTS: ED visit ratios show that NSTEMI, IS, and HF visits dropped to lows of 56%, 64%, and 61% of 2019 levels, respectively, in the early-pandemic and gradually returned to 2019 levels over the next several months. HS visits also dropped early pandemic period to 60% of 2019 levels, but quickly rebounded. We find mixed evidence on whether STEMI visits fell, relative to pre-pandemic rates. Total adult ED visits nadired at 57% of 2019 volume during the early-pandemic period and have only party recovered since, to approximately 84% of 2019 by the end of October 2020. CONCLUSION: We confirm prior studies that ED visits for serious cardiovascular conditions declined early in the COVID-19 pandemic for NSTEMI, IS, HS, and HF, but not for STEMI.

A stress and coping framework is used to describe key factors that account for mental health difficulties resulting from the stress of pandemics including the pandemic course, political leadership and public response, cumulative stressors, risk and protective factors, and coping strategies. Psychology organizations could do much to provide help particularly to vulnerable healthcare and frontline workers, the elderly, and the socially isolated. They could offer clinical services and design prevention programs, train non-professional community workers to provide mental health first aid, assist NGO's and political leaders, and translate basic research on psychological factors that influence acceptance of public health measures. The pandemic occurs at a time of advanced connectivity that provides an opportunity for (a) scientific information exchange, (b) alleviation of distress of social isolation, but also (c) infodemic, unprecedented spread of hoaxes and online incitements to non-compliance with preventative measures. Psychology's role is not limited to addressing mental health needs but also includes promoting adjustment to changes in the economy, education and employment, and developing effective communication strategies that encourage acceptance of public health measures.

É nesse contexto de incertezas e medos que decidimos investigar de que modo a sociedade brasileira vem avaliando seus governantes, sobretudo em relação à política de isolamento social. A pandemia da COVID-19 alterou os eixos da polarização política. De um lado, governadores, prefeitos e legisladores preocupados com os riscos de estrangulamento do sistema de saúde causado pela pandemia. De outro, o presidente Jair Bolsonaro, focado primordialmente nas consequências econômicas negativas da política de isolamento social. Por meio de uma pesquisa de opinião, identificamos que o ""medo da morte"" diminuiu a polarização ideológica existente no Brasil desde a eleição de Jair Bolsonaro à presidência da República. Ao contrário do que muitos esperavam, os eleitores que se auto-identificaram como de direita e centro-direita - supostamente, o núcleo de eleitores de Bolsonaro - rejeitaram seguir a recomendação e avaliam mal a performance de seu líder. Também mostramos que essa mudança de comportamento não foi influenciada pelos diferentes níveis de renda.","Pereira, Carlos; Medeiros, Amanda; Bertholini, Frederico",Rev. adm. pública (Online),231,21

We aimed to measure patient experience with electronic health record-integrated postoperative telemedicine encounters following thyroid and parathyroid surgery. METHODS: In this preliminary study, adult patients receiving postoperative electronic health record-integrated telemedicine video encounters or standard in-person visits after thyroid or parathyroid surgery at a single institution were prospectively enrolled from November 2019 through May 2020. Patients with home zip codes 10 to 75 miles from the medical center were included. Patient experience was assessed using the Consumer Assessment of Health Care Providers and Systems Clinician & Group Visit Survey 2.0 and the Communication Assessment Tool. Top box analysis was performed, defined as the percentage of respondents who chose the most positive response score. RESULTS: The cohort consisted of 45 telemedicine and 32 in-person encounters. Both groups reported similar and excellent patient experience and satisfaction (9.7 of 10 for telemedicine vs 9.8 of 10 for in-person encounters, mean difference 0.02, 95% confidence interval, [-0.25 to 0.29]). Similar surgeon communication performance was observed (mean Communication Assessment Tool top box score 83% telemedicine vs 86% in-person, mean difference 3%, 95% confidence interval [-10% to 17%]). Nonlinear increases in monthly telemedicine encounter volume were observed within the section of endocrine surgery (3-fold increase) and the health system (125-fold increase) from November 2019 to May 2020. CONCLUSION: Patients who underwent cervical endocrine surgery reported similarly high rates of satisfaction and excellent surgeon communication following either telemedicine or in-person postoperative encounters. Electronic health record-integrated telemedicine for a subset of low-risk procedures can act as a suitable replacement for in-person encounters. A surge in telemedicine use, stimulated by the coronavirus 2019 pandemic, was experienced at our institution.","Schumm, Max A; Pyo, Howard Q; Ohev-Shalom, Roben; Tseng, Chi-Hong; Livhits, Masha J; Zanocco, Kyle A; Hiyama, Darryl T; Yeh, Michael W",Surgery (St. Louis),231,15

Therefore, this study explored the potential use of Google Trends (GT) to monitor public restlessness toward COVID-19 infection in Taiwan. METHODS: We retrieved GT data for the specific locations and subregions in Taiwan nationwide using defined search terms related to the coronavirus, handwashing, and face masks. RESULTS: Searches related to COVID-19 and face masks in Taiwan rapidly increased following the announcements of Taiwan's first imported case and reached a peak as locally acquired cases were reported. However, searches for handwashing gradually increased during the period of face-mask shortage. Moreover, high to moderate correlations between Google relative search volumes (RSVs) and COVID-19 cases were found in Taipei (lag-3), New Taipei (lag-2), Taoyuan (lag-2), Tainan (lag-1), Taichung (lag0), and Kaohsiung (lag0).

Variants B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 have attracted significant attention owing to their widespread transmission and possible immune evasion. A total of 19 SARS-CoV-2 vaccines based on original strains have entered clinical studies, including nine vaccines that have obtained emergency use or conditional marketing authorizations. However, newly emerging variants may affect their protective efficacy. Decreased efficacy of the Novartis, Johnson & Johnson, and AstraZeneca vaccines against B.1.351 has been reported. The spread of variants creates a tremendous challenge for the prevention and control of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic via vaccination. Several response strategies, including accelerating massive rollouts of current vaccines, increasing vaccine immunogenicity by increasing vaccination doses, and accelerating next-generation vaccines against variants, have been suggested. AREAS COVERED: SARS-CoV-2 vaccine efficacy against variants and response strategies for emerging variants. EXPERT OPINION: Current SARS-CoV-2 vaccines authorized for emergency use or under clinical trials have shown certain advantages in providing adequate protection against new variants. We analyzed the effects of reported variants on neutralizing antibodies and the protective efficacy of different vaccines and propose strategies for applying current vaccines against variants and developing next-generation vaccines.","Bian, Lianlian; Gao, Fan; Zhang, Jialu; He, Qian; Mao, Qunying; Xu, Miao; Liang, Zhenglun",Expert Rev Vaccines,231,27

METHODS: To examine presentation and outcomes of COVID-19 in patients with ESKD on dialysis, we retrospectively collected clinical data on 59 patients on dialysis who were hospitalized with COVID-19. We used Wilcoxon rank sum and Fischer exact tests to compare patients who died versus those still living. RESULTS: Two of the study's 59 patients were on peritoneal dialysis, and 57 were on hemodialysis. Median age was 63 years, with high prevalence of hypertension (98%) and diabetes (69%). Patients who died were significantly older than those still living (median age, 75 versus 62 years) and had a higher median Charlson comorbidity index (8 versus 7). The most common presenting symptoms were fever (49%) and cough (39%); initial radiographs most commonly showed multifocal or bilateral opacities (59%). By end of follow-up, 18 patients (31%) died a median 6 days after hospitalization, including 75% of patients who required mechanical ventilation. Eleven of those who died had advanced directives against intubation. The remaining 41 patients (69%) were discharged home a median 8 days after admission. The median initial white blood cell count was significantly higher in patients who died compared with those still living (7.5 versus 5.7×103/µl), as was C-reactive protein (163 versus 80 mg/L).

To overcome the limitations, a new method called flexible PCA (FPCA) for exponential family distributions is proposed. The goal is to ensure that it can be implemented to arbitrary shaped region for either count or continuous observations. The methodology of FPCA is developed under the framework of generalized linear models. It provides statistical models for FPCA not limited to matrix expressions of the data. A maximum likelihood approach is proposed to derive the decomposition when the number of principal components (PCs) is known. This naturally induces a penalized likelihood approach to determine the number of PCs when it is unknown. By modifying it for missing data problems, the proposed method is compared with previous PCA methods for missing data. The simulation study shows that the performance of FPCA is always better than its competitors.

The research examined the effects of social determinants of health on COVID-19 related stress, family's stress and discord, and personal diagnosis of COVID-19. METHODS: In November 2020, the data collection was conducted from 97 counties in North Carolina (Nâ¯=â¯1500). Adult residents in North Carolina completed an online COVID-19 impact survey conducted using quota-based sampling on race, income, and county to provide a rapid quasi-representative assessment of COVID impact. The study investigated the variables in a structural model through structural equation modeling. For data analysis, IBM SPSS and AMOS were deployed. RESULTS: Social determinants of health had direct effects on COVID-19 related stress (ßâ¯=â¯.66, p < .001, r2â¯=â¯.43), family's stress and discord (ßâ¯=â¯.73, p < .001, r2â¯=â¯.53), and personal diagnosis of COVID-19 (ßâ¯=â¯.52, p < .001, r2â¯=â¯.27). These findings indicate that underserved populations experienced higher stress and discord at both individual and family levels and more severe COVID-19 symptoms. Moreover, black participants, whose family income and food access declined significantly more, had worse stress, discord, and COVID-19 symptoms than white participants. CONCLUSIONS: The study suggests that the government and health professionals enhance mental health and family support service accessibility for underprivileged populations through telehealth and community health programs to prevent associated social and health issues such as suicide, violence, and cancer.","Lee, Dohyun; Paul, Christopher; Pilkington, William; Mulrooney, Timothy; Diggs, Nicole; Kumar, Deepak",J Affect Disord Rep,231,16

All large-scale studies of the CAVI have investigated patients <80 years old. Thus, the clinical characteristics of high CAVI in patients aged 80 or more remain unclear. Therefore, we investigated (1) the CAVI in very elderly patients and (2) the determinants of a high CAVI in high-risk patients, including very elderly patients. The Cardiovascular Prognostic Coupling Study in Japan (Coupling Registry) is a prospective observational study of Japanese outpatients with any cardiovascular risk factors. We enrolled 5109 patients from 30 institutions (average age 68.7 ± 11.4 years, 52.4% males). We investigated the determinants of the CAVI by separating the patients into three groups: 970 middle-aged (<60 years), 3252 elderly (60-79 years), and 887 very elderly (&#8805;80 years) patients. The CAVI values of the males were significantly higher those of the females in all age groups (<60 years: 7.81 ± 1.11 vs. 7.38 ± 0.99, P < .001; 60-79 years: 9.20 ± 1.29 vs. 8.66 ± 1.07, P < .001; &#8805;80 years: 10.26 ± 1.39 vs. 9.51 ± 1.12, P < .001). In all age groups, the CAVI of the patients with diabetes/glucose tolerance disorder was higher than that of the patients without diabetes/glucose tolerance disorder (<60 years: 7.82 ± 1.22 vs 7.58 ± 1.03, P = .002; 60-79 years: 9.23 ± 1.20 vs 8.78 ± 1.19, P < .001; &#8805;80 years: 10.04 ± 1.24 vs 9.75 ± 1.32, P = .002). The determinants of the CAVI in these very elderly patients were age, male sex, low BMI, and mean blood pressure. Diabetes/glucose tolerance disorder and glucose were independently associated with the CAVI in the patients aged <60 years and 60-79 years, but not in those aged &#8805;80 years after adjusting for other covariates.","Kabutoya, Tomoyuki; Hoshide, Satoshi; Fujiwara, Takeshi; Negishi, Keita; Nishizawa, Masafumi; Yamamoto, Mitsuyoshi; Yamagiwa, Kayo; Kawashima, Akihiro; Yoshida, Tetsuro; Nakazato, Jun; Matsui, Yoshio; Sekizuka, Hiromitsu; Abe, Hideyasu; Abe, Yasuhisa; Fujita, Yumiko; Sato, Kei; Narita, Keisuke; Tsuchiya, Norihiro; Kubota, Yoshiaki; Hashizume, Toshikazu; Kario, Kazuomi",J. clin. hypertens.

METHODS: The sample comprised 215 female undergraduates who responded to a two-questionnaire anonymous survey conducted in Tokyo, Japan in 2018 and 2019 from November to December. We measured mindful eating status using the Expanded Mindful Eating Scale (EMES) and used Japanese plant-based dietary indices to determine plant-based dietary patterns. Partial correlation analyses were conducted to determine the correlation of mindful eating with energy and nutrient intake, food consumption, and plant-based dietary patterns, after adjusting for demographics and body mass index. RESULTS: Participants with higher sub-scores in ""health of the planet"" and ""awareness and appreciation for food"" ate higher quantities of several micronutrients and plant-based foods and were more likely to have a healthful plant-based dietary pattern. They were also less likely to have an unhealthful plant-based dietary pattern. In contrast, participants with higher scores in ""non-judgmental awareness"" ate less protein, whole grains, and vegetables, and were likely to have an unhealthful plant-based dietary pattern. CONCLUSION: This study is the first to show that young Japanese women with normal or lean body weight were more likely to consume healthful plant-based foods when they ate mindfully.

METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional online survey in four universities in Guangdong Province (China) based on purposive sampling. A self-administered questionnaire was given to College students (CSs) to measure the supportive attitude towards an outbreak control strategy and adoption of NPIs in respondents. RESULTS: A total of 44,446 CSs participated between 31 January and 10 February 2020; 92.7% of respondents supported the outbreak control strategy. The proportion of respondents who avoided public places, wore a facemask, avoid gatherings, and washed hands more frequently than usual was 94.8, 92.8, 91.2 and 86.9%. respectively. A total of 76.5% respondents adopted all four measures. A supportive attitude was associated with NPI adoption. Students who were female, postgraduate, anxious, and not depressed tended to have a higher supportive attitude and higher chance of NPI adoption. CONCLUSIONS: Higher supportiveness towards the disease control strategy for the Chinese public may lead to higher adoption rate of NPIs. Psychosocial factors were related to a supportive attitude and adoption of the NPI. We believe that our findings could aid policymakers to create NPIs to prevent and control emerging infectious diseases such as COVID-19.","Shen, Dong; Liu, Dan; Cai, Miaochun; Chen, Peiliang; Wang, Zhenghe; Zhang, Yujie; Li, Zhihao; Zhang, Xiru; Wu, Xianbo; Yang, Xingfen; Mao, Chen",BMC Public Health,231,26

BRCA1/BARD1 are the best-known tumor suppressors that promote homology recombination (HR) and arrest cell cycle. However, it remains ambiguous whether and how their E3 ligase activity regulates HR. Here, we demonstrate that upon genotoxic stress, BRCA1 together with BARD1 catalyzes the K48 polyubiquitination on LARP7, a 7SK RNA binding protein known to control RNAPII pausing, and thereby degrades it through the 26S ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. Depleting LARP7 suppresses the expression of CDK1 complex, arrests the cell at the G2/M DNA damage checkpoint, and reduces BRCA2 phosphorylation, which thereby facilitates RAD51 recruitment to damaged DNA to enhance HR. Importantly, LARP7 depletion observed in breast cancer patients leads to chemoradiotherapy resistance both in vitro and in vivo. Altogether, this study unveils a mechanism by which BRCA1/BARD1 control HR and cell cycle, and highlights LARP7 as a potential target for cancer prevention and therapy.","Zhang, Fang; Yan, Pengyi; Yu, Huijing; Le, Huangying; Li, Zixuan; Chen, Jiahuan; Liang, Xiaodong; Wang, Shiyan; Wei, Weiting; Liu, Li; Zhang, Yan; Ji, Xing; Xie, Anyong; Chen, Wantao; Han, Zeguang; Pu, William T; Chen, Sun; Chen, Yingwei; Sun, Kun; Ge, Baoxie; Zhang, Bing",Cell Rep,231,20

In this order, we have created a questionnaire with general information about the family, general information about the child with chronic respiratory disease, overall physical and mental health before and during the pandemic, needs and mental health condition of the parents/caregivers. This survey showed that this group of families of children with respiratory disorders have suffered financially in significant way and has changed the way they perform professional and educational patterns due to the pandemic. Most of the children were stable in their physical health, but their mental health has deteriorated. This is probably due to the regular contact with the medical staff, but not with the mental health professionals. This group of children has a significant reduction in their physical activity and increase the hours in front of TV screens.

Hospitalization and death of COVID-19 patients in the countries most affected by the pandemic has been associated to chronic comorbidities. OBJECTIVE: To describe the prevalence of NCDs in patients with COVID-19 in Mexico and analyze the increased risk due to comorbidities and risk factors on hospitalization, utilization of intensive care units and death. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was performed from 212,802 confirmed COVID-19 cases reported by the Ministry of Health up to June 27, 2020. Odds ratios were performed using logistic regression model. RESULTS: Up to 47.40% of patients with COVID-19 diagnosis were also reported with a comorbidity, with hypertension being the most frequent (20.12%). The report of at least one NCD significantly increased the risk of death with respect to patients without such diagnoses. Chronic kidney disease increased the risk of death the most (OR 2.31), followed by diabetes (OR 1.69), immunosuppression (OR 1.62), obesity (OR 1.42), hypertension (OR 1.24), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (OR 1.20). The comorbidities that most increased the risk of ICU and of intubation were diabetes, immunosuppression and obesity. CONCLUSION: NCD comorbidities increase the severity of COVID-19 infection. Given high NCD prevalence rates among the Mexican population, the pandemic poses a special threat to the health system and to society. Special prevention measures need to be strengthened for persons with NCD diagnoses in the short-term. In the mid-term, disease control strategies need to be improved to protect these patients against COVID-19 severity.","Hernández-Galdamez, Diego Rolando; González-Block, Miguel Ángel; Romo-Dueñas, Daniela Karola; Lima-Morales, René; Hernández-Vicente, Irma Alejandra; Lumbreras-Guzmán, Marivel; Méndez-Hernández, Pablo",Arch. med. res,231,24

We aim to assess the characteristics of COVID-19 patients diagnosed with pulmonary embolism (PE). METHODS: We conducted a single centre, retrospective observational cohort study of COVID-19 patients admitted between 1st March and 30th April 2020 subsequently diagnosed with PE following computed tomography pulmonary angiogram (CTPA). Patient demographics, comorbidities, presenting complaints and inpatient investigations were recorded. RESULTS: We identified 15 COVID-19 patients diagnosed with PE (median age = 58 years [IQR = 23], 87% male). 2 died (13%), both male patients >70 years. Most common symptoms were dyspnoea (N = 10, 67%) and fever (N = 7, 47%). 12 (80%) reported 7 days or more of non-resolving symptoms prior to admission. 7 (47%) required continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), 2 (13%) of which were subsequently intubated. All patients had significantly raised D-dimer levels, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), C-reactive protein (CRP), ferritin and prothrombin times. The distribution of PEs correlated with the pattern of consolidation observed on CTPA in 9 (60%) patients; the majority being peripheral or subsegmental (N = 14, 93%) and only 1 central PE. 10 (67%) had an abnormal resting electrocardiogram (ECG), the commonest finding being sinus tachycardia. 6 (40%) who underwent transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) had structurally and functionally normal right hearts. CONCLUSION: Our study suggests that patients who demonstrate acute deterioration, a protracted course of illness with non-resolving symptoms, worsening dyspnoea, persistent oxygen requirements or significantly raised D-dimer levels should be investigated for PE, particularly in the context of COVID-19 infection. TTE and to a lesser degree the ECG are unreliable predictors of PE within this context.","Kho, Jason; Ioannou, Adam; Van den Abbeele, Koenraad; Mandal, Amit K J; Missouris, Constantinos G",Am. j. emerg. med,231,16

About 25 year ago, a natural product, myriocin was isolated from culture broths of the fungus Isaria sinclairii. Myriocin, a rather complex amino acid having three successive asymmetric centers, was found to show a potent immunosuppressive activity in vitro; however, it induced a strong toxicity in vivo. To find out a less toxic immunosuppressive candidate, the chemical structure of myriocin was simplified to a nonchiral symmetric 2-substituted-2-aminoproane-1,3-diol framework. Finally, a highly potent immunosuppressant, fingolimod was found by the extensive chemical modification and pharmacological evaluation using skin allograft model in vivo. Throughout the analyses of the mechanism action of fingolimod, it is revealed that S1P receptor 1 (S1P1) plays an essential role in lymphocyte circulation and that the molecular target of fingolimod is S1P1. Phosphorylated fingolimod acts as a ""functional"" antagonist at S1P1, modulates lymphocyte circulation, and shows a potent immunosuppressive activity. Fingolimod significantly reduced the relapse rate of MS in the clinical studies and has been approved as a new therapeutic drug for MS in more than 80 countries.","Chiba, Kenji",J. antibiot,231,13

Our findings indicate that it is important to screen the thrombotic status of cases with mild/moderate COVID-19. METHODS: Between 11 June and 8 July 2020, 23 patients with mild/moderate COVID-19 pneumonia consented to having computed tomography pulmonary angiography (CPTA) and computed tomography venography (CTV) scans of the lungs and extremity veins. Doppler ultrasound (DUS) was also performed in all patients for screening. The incidence, clinical manifestations, laboratory examinations, imaging features, and prognosis, of patients with venous thromboembolism (VTE) were analyzed and compared with those of patients with COVID-19 pneumonia without VTE. RESULTS: Nineteen patients (82.6%) had VTE, mainly distal limb thrombosis. Only one of the VTE patients was positive when screened by DUS; the other VTE patients were negative by DUS. All of the mild/moderate patients with VTE were screened by CTPA + CTV. Blood tests for inflammatory, coagulation, and biochemical, parameters were all within the normal range, except for WBC and LDH. CONCLUSIONS: When using CTV screening for DVT, we found that the incidence of thrombosis in patients with mild/moderate COVID-19 markedly increased to 82.6% (19/23). Screening for thrombosis is therefore important in patients with COVID-19. CTV is more sensitive than DUS for the detection of thrombosis. More research is now needed to evaluate the significance of thrombosis in COVID-19 pneumonia.","Chen, Budong; Jiang, Chunguo; Han, Bing; Guan, Chunshuang; Fang, Gaoli; Yan, Shuo; Wang, Kexin; Liu, Ligai; Conlon, Christopher P; Xie, Ruming; Song, Rui",Int J Infect Dis,231,15

Methods: PubMed, ISI, Embase, Scopus, Medicine have been used until September 2020 to search for articles. Therefore, EndNote X9 used to manage electronic resources. A 95% confidence interval (CI) effect size, fixed effect model, Inverse-variance methods have been calculated. The positive rate of SARS-CoV2 assessed with meta analysis. To deal with potential heterogeneity, random effects were used, and I2 showed heterogeneity. I2 values above 50% signified moderate-to-high heterogeneity. The Meta-analysis has been evaluated with Stata/MP v.16 (the fastest version of Stata) statistical software. Results: According to the study's purpose, in the initial search with keywords, 19 articles were found, the full text of 3 studies was reviewed, and finally, three studies were selected. The positive rate of SARS-CoV2 was 86% (86%; 95% CI 67 %-100%). Conclusion: saliva can be a non-invasive specimen type for diagnosis of COVID-19. Dentists should be aware that saliva plays a major role in the transmission of COVID-19 from human to human, and failure to follow prevention protocols can contaminate them","Amiri, Ali; Moradinejad, Pantea; Nasrabadi, Navid; Vojoodi, Marzieh Ghasemi",Braz. j. oral sci,231,32

I show how he develops a political theology of the spirit through a discussion of social distancing In this argument Žižek connects the idea of physical distance to the biblical story of the resurrection, in which Jesus says to Mary Magdalene “noli me tangere” (“touch me not”), in order to imagine the emergence of a community of spirit from the social, political, and economic ruin caused by the COVID-19 pandemic Contrasting this community of spirit to the Chinese Communist Party's Foucauldian response to the outbreak of the virus, Žižek suggests a turn away from Prometheanism and the logic of domination toward a new posthuman humanitarianism based on a recognition of human weakness, vulnerability, and fragility In Žižek's view, this turn toward a new form of humility would emerge from the final disenchantment of the spirit of capitalism and a recognition of the difference between human work, which contributes to a meaningful world, and bestial labor that dehumanizes and means nothing Thus, the article shows how Žižek thinks about the pandemic in terms of a crisis of late capitalism and the possibility of a new spirit of communism While the presexual nonlife of the virus is comparable to the drive of capitalism in respect of its unthinking will to replication and reproduction, Žižek founds the basis of humanity in our (human) mortality and being toward death that open out onto a new horizon of releasement (Gelassenheit) beyond biotechnoeconomic nihilism The conclusion of the article, therefore, shows how Žižek imagines that the pandemic presents humanity with an existential choice about the way we organize social life This choice is between the biopolitical domination of Chinese authoritarianism that seeks to control every aspect of life, American disaster capitalism that accepts the brutality of the state of nature, and finally Žižek's utopian spirit of communism based on a recognition of human and planetary finitude","Featherstone, Mark",Cultural Politics: an International Journal,231,26

However, FL still suffers from shortcomings such as single-point-failure and malicious data. The emergence of blockchain provides a secure and efficient solution for the deployment of FL. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive survey of the literature on blockchained FL (BCFL). First, we investigate how blockchain can be applied to federal learning from the perspective of system composition. Then, we analyze the concrete functions of BCFL from the perspective of mechanism design and illustrate what problems blockchain addresses specifically for FL. We also survey the applications of BCFL in reality. Finally, we discuss some challenges and future research directions.","Wang, Zhilin; Hu, Qin",,231,16

The preparedness and capacity of African palliative care services to respond to COVID-19 is unknown. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the preparedness and capacity of African palliative care services to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: We developed, piloted, and conducted a cross-sectional online survey guided by the 2005 International Health Regulations. It was electronically mailed to the 166 African Palliative Care Association's members and partners. Descriptive analyses were conducted. RESULTS: About 83 participants from 21 countries completed the survey. Most services had at least one procedure for the case management of COVID-19 or another infectious disease (63%). Respondents reported concerns over accessing running water, soap, and disinfectant products (43%, 42%, and 59%, respectively) and security concerns for themselves or their staff (52%). Two in five services (41%) did not have any or make available additional personal protective equipment. Most services (80%) reported having the capacity to use technology instead of face-to-face appointment, and half (52%) reported having palliative care protocols for symptom management and psychological support that could be shared with nonspecialist staff in other health care settings. CONCLUSION: Our survey suggests that African palliative care services could support the wider health system's response to the COVID-19 pandemic with greater resources such as basic infection control materials. It identified specific and systemic weaknesses impeding their preparedness to respond to outbreaks. The findings call for urgent measures to ensure staff and patient safety.","Boufkhed, Sabah; Namisango, Eve; Luyirika, Emmanuel; Sleeman, Katherine E; Costantini, Massimo; Peruselli, Carlo; Normand, Charles; Higginson, Irene J; Harding, Richard",J Pain Symptom Manage,231,16

Comparar las propiedades diagnósticas de cinco definiciones de caso sospechoso de COVID-19 utilizadas o propuestas en Chile durante los primeros ocho meses de la pandemia. Métodos. Se analizaron las propiedades diagnósticas (sensibilidad, especificidad, y valores predictivos positivo y negativo) de tres definiciones de caso sospechoso de COVID-19 utilizadas en Chile entre marzo y octubre del 2020, y dos propuestas de definición alternativas. La muestra fue de 2 019 personas con resultados conocidos a la prueba de la reacción en cadena de la polimerasa (PCR) para SARS-CoV-2. Para elaborar el criterio 5 se aplicó una regresión logística escalonada (stepwise) optimizando los valores de sensibilidad y especificidad. Se exploró la asociación de variables demográficas, síntomas y signos con la positividad a la PCR mediante regresión logística multifactorial. Se analizaron diferentes escenarios de positividad y se compararon las curvas ROC. Resultados. La presencia de anosmia (OR = 8,00; IC95%: 5,34–11,99) y fiebre (OR = 2,15; IC95%: 1,28–3,59) y el haber tenido contacto estrecho previo con una persona enferma de COVID-19 (OR = 2,89; IC95%: 2,16–3,87) se asociaron con un resultado positivo de la PCR. Según el análisis de las curvas ROC, el criterio 5 tuvo la mayor capacidad de discriminación, aunque sin diferencias significativas con los otros cuatro criterios. Conclusiones. El criterio 5 —basado en la anosmia, el contacto estrecho con personas enfermas de COVID-19 y la fiebre como elementos únicos suficientes— tuvo la mayor sensibilidad para identificar los casos sospechosos de COVID-19, aspecto fundamental para controlar la propagación de la pandemia.","Aubert, Josefina; Durán, Doris; Monsalves, María José; Rodríguez, María Francisca; Rotarou, Elena S.; Gajardo, Jean; Alfaro, Tania; Bertoglia, María Paz; Muñoz, Sergio; Cuadrado, Cristóbal",Rev. panam. salud pública,231,6

It discusses how remote learning technologies can positively influence students' learning and entry in sustainable education. The paper looks at the use of distance learning in higher education as a means to help students in the built environment and its use within the education system. It studies and expands the theoretical research on the benefits of distance learning, where the study is remote and there is no personal contact with staff or students, and examines the impact of distance learning on the student's learning experience. It also proposes and evaluates potential solutions to overcome the barriers to learning in the built environment and create successful virtual learning communities, recognising that such improvements must be reconciled with the primary benefits identified. The paper provides an overview of sustainable distance learning within higher education and discusses the differences between learning outside the structural environment of a profession, what it means for the student's learning experience and the potential to overcome barriers to distance learning. This is a very timely topic in the times of COVID-10 pandemic. Lockdowns of the economy and social life impacted all spheres of education with schools and universities closed for long periods of time and all teaching moved to online and distance mode. However, coronavirus pandemic also brought the digital surge in the system of education, including the sustainable education.

Its mechanism remains unexplained. OBJECTIVE: The main objective was to investigate explanatory variables relating to the risk of developing SSPE and its pathophysiology. METHODS: Literature analysis was focused on different varieties of SSPE: perinatal forms, short-incubation forms similar to acute measles inclusion body encephalitis (MIBE), rapidly evolving forms, forms occurring in the immunosuppressed, adult forms, and family forms. In addition, several studies on the parameters of innate immunity and interferon responses of patients were analyzed. RESULTS: Two main data were highlighted: a relationship between the so-called fulminant forms and the prescription of corticosteroids was established. In familial SSPE, two groups were individualized according to the duration of the latency period, prompting an analysis of patient exomes. CONCLUSION: Treatment with corticosteroids should be banned. Knowledge of the genes involved and epigenetics should be useful for understanding the pathophysiology of SSPE and other late-onset neurological infections with RNA viruses.","Lebon, P; Gelot, A; Zhang, S-Y; Casanova, J-L; Hauw, J-J",Rev. neurol.

The aim of our study is to compare MWA and pulmonary lobectomy in high-risk, lung cancer patients. METHODS: This was a single-center, propensity score--weighted cohort study. All adult patients who underwent CT guided MWA for stage I NSCLC between June 2009-October 2014 were included in the study and were compared with a cohort of patients submitted to lung lobectomy in the same period of time. Outcomes were overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS). RESULTS: 32 patients underwent MWA, and 35 high-risk patients submitted to lung lobectomy in the same period were selected. Median follow-up time was 51.1 months (95% CI: 43.8-62.3). Overall survival was 43.8 (95% CI: 26.1-55) and 55.8 months (95% CI: 49.9-76.8) in the MWA group and Lobectomy group, respectively. Negative prognostic factors were MWA procedure (HR:2.25, 95% CI: 1.20-4.21, p= 0.0109) and nodule diameter (HR: 1.04, 95% CI: 1.01-1.07; p= 0.007) for OS, while MWA procedure (HR: 5.2; 95% CI: 2.1-12.8: p < 0.001), ECOG 3 (HR: 5.0; 95% CI: 1.6-15.6; p = 0.006) and nodule diameter (HR: 1.1; 95% CI: 1.0-1.1; p = 0.003) for DFS. CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrated a high percentage of local relapse in the MWA group but a comparable overall survival.

Using hybrids approach, we constructed a novel series of cationic surfactant-sulfonamide conjugates (3a-g) through quaternization of the as-prepared sulfonamide derivatives (2a-g) with n-hexadecyl iodide followed by structural characterization by spectroscopy (IR and NMR). Being collective properties required in petroleum-processing environment, the petro-collecting/dispersing capacities on the surface of waters with different degrees of mineralization, and the antimicrobial performance against microbes and sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB) that mitigate microbiological corrosion were investigated for the synthesized conjugates. Among these conjugates, 3g (2.5% aq. solution) exhibited the strongest ability to disperse the thin petroleum film on the seawater surface, whereas KD is 95.33% after 96 h. In diluted form, 3f collected the petroleum layer on distilled water surface (Kmax = 32.01) for duration exceeds 4 days. Additionally, almost all compounds revealed high potency and comparable action with standard antimicrobials, especially 3b and 3f, which emphasize their role as potential biocides. Regarding biocidal activity against SRB, 3g causes a significant reduction in the bacterial count from 2.8 × 106 cells/mL to Nil. Moreover, the conducted molecular docking study confirms the strong correlation between RNA polymerase binding with bioactivity against microbes over other studied proteins (threonine synthase and cyclooxygenase-2).","Tantawy, Ahmed H; Shaban, Mahmoud M; Jiang, Hong; Wang, Man-Qun; Mohamed, Hany I",J Mol Liq,231,1

As the vaccine supply will be limited for a considerable period of time in many countries, it is important to devise the effective vaccination strategies that reduce the number of deaths and incidence of infection. One of the characteristics of COVID-19 is that the symptom, severity, and mortality of the disease differ by age. Thus, when the vaccination supply is limited, age-dependent vaccination priority strategy should be implemented to minimize the incidences and mortalities. In this study, we developed an age-structured model for describing the transmission dynamics of COVID-19, including vaccination. Using the model and actual epidemiological data in Korea, we estimated the infection probability for each age group under different levels of social distancing implemented in Korea and investigated the effective age-dependent vaccination strategies to reduce the confirmed cases and fatalities of COVID-19. We found that, in a lower level of social distancing, vaccination priority for the age groups with the highest transmission rates will reduce the incidence mostly, but, in higher levels of social distancing, prioritizing vaccination for the elderly age group reduces the infection incidences more effectively. To reduce mortalities, vaccination priority for the elderly age group is the best strategy in all scenarios of levels of social distancing. Furthermore, we investigated the effect of vaccine supply and efficacy on the reduction in incidence and mortality.","Choi, Y.; Kim, J. S.; Kim, J. E.; Choi, H.; Lee, C.

Although evidence on its pathophysiology is growing, there are still issues that should be taken into consideration, including its effects on pre-existing peripheral vascular disease. The aim of this review is to describe the thrombotic and endothelial dysfunctions caused by SARS-CoV-2, assess if cardiovascular comorbidities render an individual susceptible to the infection and determine the course of pre-existing vascular diseases in infected individuals. A search through MEDLINE, PubMed and EMBASE was conducted and more than 260 articles were identified and 97 of them were reviewed;the rest were excluded because they were not related to the aim of this study. Hypertension, cardiovascular disease, diabetes mellitus and cerebrovascular diseases comprised 24.30% ± 16.23%, 13.29% ± 12.88%, 14.82% ± 7.57% and 10.82% ± 11.64% of the cohorts reviewed, respectively. Arterial and venous thrombotic complications rocketed up to 31% in severely infected individuals in some studies. We suggest that hypertension, cardiovascular diseases, diabetes and cerebrovascular diseases may render an individual susceptible to severe COVID-19 infection. Pre-existing vascular diseases are expected to deteriorate with SARS-CoV-2 infection as a consequence of its increased thrombotic burden and the development of endothelial dysfunction. COVID-19 has emerged only a few months ago and it is premature to predict the long-term effects to the vascular system. Its disturbances of the coagulation mechanisms and effects on vascular endothelium will likely provoke a surge of vascular complications in the coming months.

The causative agent behind this disease is the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome - novel Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). SARS-CoV-2 belongs to the category of RNA viruses. The main protease, responsible for the cleavage of the viral polyprotein is considered as one of the hot targets for treating COVID-19. Earlier reports suggest the use of HIV anti-viral drugs for targeting the main protease of SARS-CoV, which caused SARS in the year 2002-2003. Hence, drug repurposing approach may prove to be useful in targeting the main protease of SARS-CoV-2. The high-resolution crystal structure of the main protease of SARS-CoV-2 (PDB ID: 6LU7) was used as the target. The Food and Drug Administration approved and SWEETLEAD database of drug molecules were screened. The apo form of the main protease was simulated for a cumulative of 150 ns and 10 µs open-source simulation data was used, to obtain conformations for ensemble docking. The representative structures for docking were selected using RMSD-based clustering and Markov State Modeling analysis. This ensemble docking approach for the main protease helped in exploring the conformational variation in the drug-binding site of the main protease leading to the efficient binding of more relevant drug molecules. The drugs obtained as top hits from the ensemble docking possessed anti-bacterial and anti-viral properties. This in silico ensemble docking approach would support the identification of potential candidates for repurposing against COVID-19. Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

The impact of surface pollutant concentration of PM10 on CG lightning initiation, as well as the production of NO2 and surface ozone derived by lightning occurrence is investigated. To proceed, the reports of thunderstorm occurrence, including CG lightning in the Tehran area have been collected for years of study from the Iran meteorological organization (IRIMO). The surface pollution data are obtained from the Air Quality Control Center (AQCC) for several stations in the area of interest. The number of lightning (NoL) associated with the selected dates is obtained using the World Wide Lightning Location Network (WWLLN). The correlation coefficients associated with the CG lightning and the concentrations of PM10, NO2, and surface ozone are calculated. The hourly variations of accumulated NoL and NO2 and surface ozone are also compared for 24 hours before and after the lightning activity for four days of study during the years of 2009-2013. The results show that there is a positive correlation between PM10 concentration and lightning flash number, obtained from observational data of WWLLN. Moreover, the comparison of NoL and surface pollutant concentration indicates a clear positive contribution from CG lightning in NO2 and ozone production. In days with a considerable number of lightning occurrences, the comparison of the hourly average of NO2 and O3 concentrations with the lightning flash number reveals that NO2 decreases, and O3 increases due to the significant increases of lightning strikes.","Gharaylou, Maryam; Mahmoudian, Alireza; Bidokhti, AbbasAli A; Dadras, Pegah Sadr",Environ Monit Assess,231,26

However, the course of this disease in immunosuppressed patients remains unknown. This study aimed to describe the course of COVID-19 infection and its effects on lung transplant recipients. METHODS: This was a single-center, retrospective, observational study. The recipients with suspicious symptoms and/or a contact history with infected individuals were diagnosed with COVID-19 by performing a reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test using samples obtained from the nasopharynx swabs or bronchial lavage. We classified the patients into mild, moderate, and high severity groups according to their clinical conditions. In patients with positive RT-PCR results, cell cycle inhibitor drugs were withdrawn, while steroids were maintained at the same level as in patients without clinical deterioration. RESULTS: Of the seven recipients diagnosed with COVID-19 infection, one experienced a re-infection. Each recipient had at least one comorbidity. Smell disorder (12,5%), cough/dyspnea (37%), and fever/chills/shivering (37%) were the most frequent symptoms. The mean follow-up time after infection was 108 days. No deaths were recorded due to COVID-19; however, the pulmonary function test values of two recipients were decreased during subsequent follow-ups. CONCLUSION: In our small group of transplant recipients with COVID-19, there were two cases of pulmonary function deterioration and a case of re-infection, and no recipient died. It is suggested that steroid therapy should be initiated in the early period in patients with pulmonary opacities. This article is protected by copyright.

METHODS Data were collected on 2,857 blood donors from April 14 to 27, 2020. This study reports crude prevalence of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2, population weighted prevalence for the state, and prevalence adjusted for test sensitivity and specificity. Logistic regression models were used to establish the correlates of SARS-CoV-2 prevalence. For the analysis, we considered collection period and site, sociodemographic characteristics, and place of residence. RESULTS The proportion of positive tests for SARS-Cov-2, without any adjustment, was 4.0% (95%CI 3.3-4.7%), and the weighted prevalence was 3.8% (95%CI 3.1-4.5%). We found lower estimates after adjusting for test sensitivity and specificity: 3.6% (95%CI 2.7-4.4%) for the non-weighted prevalence, and 3.3% (95%CI 2.6-4.1%) for the weighted prevalence. Collection period was the variable most significantly associated with crude prevalence: the later the period, the higher the prevalence. Regarding sociodemographic characteristics, the younger the blood donor, the higher the prevalence, and the lower the education level, the higher the odds of testing positive for SARS-Cov-2 antibody. We found similar results for weighted prevalence. CONCLUSIONS Our findings comply with some basic premises: the increasing trend over time, as the epidemic curve in the state is still on the rise; and the higher prevalence among both the youngest, for moving around more than older age groups, and the less educated, for encountering more difficulties in following social distancing recommendations.

The aim of this study was to assess the clinical efficacy of HIVC on hyperinflammation in patients with severe COVID-19. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study included hospitalized patients with severe COVID-19, a subset of whom was treated with HIVC. The medical records were screened for demographic data, laboratory findings, and medications, as well as initial and repeated values of multiple inflammatory markers for analysis. RESULTS: A high percentage of patients presented with hyperinflammation based on inflammatory marker levels above the upper limit of normal (high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, 80.1%; interleukin-6, 91.5%; and tumor necrosis factor-&#945;, 67.4%). Eighty-five (36%) patients received HIVC therapy. After treatment with HIVC, the levels of inflammatory markers displayed a significant decrease compared with those of patients without HIVC. Furthermore, the percentages of reduction in inflammatory marker levels were higher in patients receiving HIVC compared with those in patients treated without HIVC. Stepwise multiple linear regression analysis revealed that HIVC was independently associated with percentages of reduction in levels of inflammatory markers.

Western European hedgehogs (Erinaceus europaeus) are mammalian hibernators, mainly nocturnal and insectivorous, living in natural open and green spaces as well as artificial, rural and urban, areas. They are generalist predators of macro-invertebrates, but they may also eat meat, bird eggs and on occasion pet food. These ecological and feeding habits, along with their high population densities, notable synanthropic attitudes, frequent contacts with sympatric wild and domestic species, including humans, implicate the possibility of intra- and interspecies interactions accounting for the possible involvement of E. europaeus in the ecology of several potentially emerging pathogens, including coronaviruses. Using PCR-based and virus isolation methods, we found that 58.3% of 24 hedgehogs’ fecal samples were PCR-positive for Erinaceus coronaviruses (EriCoVs). We did not observe any clinical disease related to the EriCoV infection in hedgehogs. However, the high mutation rates characterizing members of the Coronaviridae family and their potential successful interspecies host jumps—as that likely occurred in the Novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) emergence—should be considered in the management of hedgehogs admitted to multi-species wildlife rehabilitation centers, recommending their return back to the original recovery areas. ABSTRACT: The Western European Hedgehog (Erinaceus europaeus) is one of the four hedgehog species belonging to the genus Erinaceus. Among them, E. amurensis is extant in East Asia’s areas only, whereas E. europaeus, E. roumanicus and E. concolor are mainly found in Europe. E. europaeus is endemically distributed from western to central and southern Europe, including Italy. Western European hedgehogs’ ecological and feeding habits, along with their high population densities, notable synanthropic attitudes, frequent contacts with sympatric wild and domestic species, including humans, implicate the possible involvement of E. europaeus in the ecology of potentially emerging viruses, such as coronaviruses, influenza A and influenza D viruses, canine distemper virus, pestiviruses and Aujeszky’s disease virus. We examined 24 E. europaeus individuals found injured in urban and rural areas of Northern Italy. Of the 24 fecal samples collected and tested for the above-mentioned pathogens by both PCR-based and virus isolation methods, 14 were found PCR-positive for betacoronaviruses belonging to lineage C and related to the known Erinaceus coronaviruses (EriCoVs), as determined by partial sequencing of the virus genome. Our findings suggest that hedgehogs could be considered natural reservoirs of CoVs, and also act as chronic shedding carriers of these potentially emerging RNA viruses.","Delogu, Mauro; Cotti, Claudia; Lelli, Davide; Sozzi, Enrica; Trogu, Tiziana; Lavazza, Antonio; Garuti, Giacomo; Castrucci, Maria Rita; Vaccari, Gabriele; De Marco, Maria Alessandra; Moreno, Ana",Animals (Basel),231,9

Post-acute COVID-19 (‘long-COVID’) seems to be a multisystem disease, sometimes occurring after a mild acute illness; people struggling with these persistent symptoms refer to themselves as ‘long haulers’. AIM: To explore experiences of people with persisting symptoms following COVID-19 infection, and their views on primary care support received. DESIGN & SETTING: Qualitative methodology, with semi-structured interviews to explore perspectives of people with persisting symptoms following suspected or confirmed COVID-19 infection. Participants were recruited via social media between July–August 2020. METHOD: Interviews were conducted by telephone or video call, digitally recorded, and transcribed with consent. Thematic analysis was conducted applying constant comparison techniques. People with experience of persisting symptoms contributed to study design and data analysis. RESULTS: This article reports analysis of 24 interviews. The main themes include: the ‘ hard and heavy work ’ of enduring and managing symptoms and accessing care; living with uncertainty, helplessness and fear, particularly over whether recovery is possible; the importance of finding the 'right' GP (understanding, empathy, and support needed); and recovery and rehabilitation: what would help? CONCLUSION: This study will raise awareness among primary care professionals, and commissioners, of long-COVID and the range of symptoms people are experiencing. Patients require their GP to believe their symptoms and to demonstrate empathy and understanding. Ongoing support by primary care professionals during recovery and rehabilitation is crucial.","Kingstone, Tom; Taylor, Anna K; O'Donnell, Catherine A; Atherton, Helen; Blane, David N; Chew-Graham, Carolyn A",BJGP open,231,3

The Illinois Department of Public Health (IDPH) and local health department staff members investigated a COVID-19 outbreak associated with this opening event. Overall, 46 COVID-19 cases were linked to the event, including cases in 26 patrons and three staff members who attended the opening event and 17 secondary cases. Four persons with cases had COVID-19-like symptoms on the same day they attended the event. Secondary cases included 12 cases in eight households with children, two on a school sports team, and three in a long-term care facility (LTCF). Transmission associated with the opening event resulted in one school closure affecting 650 children (9,100 lost person-days of school) and hospitalization of one LTCF resident with COVID-19. These findings demonstrate that opening up settings such as bars, where mask wearing and physical distancing are challenging, can increase the risk for community transmission of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. As community businesses begin to reopen, a multicomponent approach should be emphasized in settings such as bars to prevent transmission* (1). This includes enforcing consistent and correct mask use, maintaining ≥6 ft of physical distance between persons, reducing indoor bar occupancy, prioritizing outdoor seating, improving building ventilation, and promoting behaviors such as staying at home when ill, as well as implementing contact tracing in combination with isolation and quarantine when COVID-19 cases are diagnosed.","Sami, Samira; Turbyfill, Caitlin R.; Daniel-Wayman, Shelby; Shonkwiler, Stacy; Fisher, Kiva A.; Kuhring, Macey; Patrick, Aaron M.; Hinton, Stephanie; Minor, Amanda S.; Ricaldi, Jessica N.; Ezike, Ngozi; Kauerauf, Judy; Duffus, Wayne A.",MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep,231,30

First, we systematically identified 47 HOFs based on the Human Factors Analysis and Classification System (HFACS). We then converted the HFACS framework into a Bayesian Network (BN) after determining the causalities among these factors. Finally, we applied the hybrid HFACS-BN model to analyze the COVID-19 outbreak in China by virtue of its efficacy in probability prediction and diagnosis of key risk factors, and thus to test the feasibility of the model itself. This study contributes to a holistic analysis of HOFs within the public sectors with regard to PCE by providing a risk assessment model for epidemics or pandemics, and developing risk analysis methods for the public health field.","Fu, Lipeng; Wang, Xueqing; Wang, Dan; Griffin, Mark A.; Li, Peixuan",Saf Sci,231,23

This study explored the prevalence of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and depression in a sample of home-quarantined college students to identify the psychological distress risk factors. METHOD: : The PTSD and depressive symptoms in the 2485 participants from 6 universities were investigated using online survey versions of the PTSD Checklist Civilian Version and the 9-question Patient Health Questionnaires (PHQ-9), and data on sleep durations, exposure, home-quarantine time and socio-demographic variables were also collected. RESULTS: : The PTSD and depression prevalence were found to be 2.7% and 9.0%. Subjectively, feeling extreme fear was the most significant risk factor for psychological distress, followed by short sleep durations, being in their graduating year (4(th) year) and living in severely afflicted areas. Sleep durations was a mediator between exposures and mental health problems. CONCLUSIONS: : The results suggested that the psychological consequences of the COVID-19 could be serious. Psychological interventions that reduce fear and improve sleep durations need to be made available to the home-quarantined university students, and graduating students and those in the worst-hit areas should be given priority focus.","Tang, Wanjie; Hu, Tao; Hu, Baodi; Jin, Chunhan; Wang, Gang; Xie, Chao; Chen, Sen; Xu, Jiuping",J Affect Disord,231,20

Herein, 30-nm aluminum nanoparticles (ANs), unlike the mostly used adjuvant alum which is unsuitable for delivering pulmonary vaccines due to side effects, proved able to act as a VADS fitting inhalation immunization to elicit wide-spread anti-antigen immunity. In vitro ANs facilitated cellular uptake of their cargos and, after pulmonary vaccination, induced mouse production of high levels of anti-antigen IgG in serum and IgA in saliva, nasal, bronchoalveolar and also vaginal fluids. Besides, IFN-γ and anti-antigen IgG2a enriched in immunized mice which meanwhile showed no obvious lung inflammation indicated balanced Th1/Th2 responses were safely induced. These outcomes suggest ANs may be an efficient pulmonary VADS for defending against pathogens, especially, the ones invading hosts via respiratory system.

In order to understand this disparity between human use and drugs approved by regulatory agencies, we analyzed botanical drug clinical trials registered at ClinicalTrial.gov to detect trends in current trials and guide future trials. A total of 195 botanical drug clinical trials were registered from 2016 to 2019, of which 81 are phase II or phase II/III. 95% of all phase II and II/III studies were designed with 100 or less participants per arm, indicating a more observational nature due to the limited power to detect differences in outcomes between treatment and control groups. Due to the limited number of participants, efficacy outcome from results may be highly subjective. 14% of the total trials were phase I studies. For botanical drugs with well-documented or extensive history of human use, phase I may not provide significant additional information, and may, therefore, not be necessary. For the trial design, we suggest added-on studies when botanical drugs are used as part of a combination treatment.

By examining the structure of the coronavirus and briefly describing its possible pathogenesis based on recent autopsy reports conducted by various teams worldwide, this review analyzes the possible structural and functional changes of the human body upon infection with SARS-CoV-2. We observed that the most prominent pathological changes in COVID-19 patients are diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) of the lungs and microthrombus formation, resulting in an imbalance of the ventilation/perfusion ratio and respiratory failure. Although direct evidence of viral infection can also be found in other organs and tissues, the viral load is relatively small.

We report the performances of two rapid immunochromatographic antigen testing devices compared with RT‐qPCR for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2) detection in nasopharyngeal samples. We carried out a lateral‐flow tests study on 401 nasopharyngeal swab samples from nonduplicated suspected COVID‐19 subjects. An equal volume of universal transport medium tubes‐containing samples (dilution ratio = 1:15) were added to the manufacturer's extraction buffer solution (dilution ratio = 1:2) and analyzed on BioSpeedia COVID19Speed‐Antigen Test and on Abbott Panbio™ COVID‐19 Ag Rapid Test, devices. Qualitative results were compared to those obtained by the RT‐qPCR (Allplex™ SARS‐CoV‐2 Assay Seegene). Based on our data, the overall sensitivity for BioSpeedia and Panbio devices was estimated at 65.5% and 75.0%, respectively. The sensitivity was greater for cycle threshold values less than 25 achieving 90.4 and 96.8 for BioSpeedia and Panbio devices, respectively. A perfect specificity of 100.0% was observed for both devices.","Soleimani, Reza; Deckers, Corentin; Huang, Te‐Din; Bogaerts, Pierre; Evrard, Stéphanie; Wallemme, Isaline; Habib, Boutaina; Rouzé, Pauline; Denis, Olivier",J Med Virol,231,20

Based on recent reports, the most severely ill patients present with coagulopathy, and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC)‐like massive intravascular clot formation is frequently seen in this cohort. Therefore, coagulation tests may be considered useful to discriminate severe cases of COVID‐19. The clinical presentation of COVID‐19‐associated coagulopathy is organ dysfunction primarily, while hemorrhagic events are less frequent. Changes in hemostatic biomarkers represented by increase in D‐dimer and fibrin/fibrinogen degradation products indicate the essence of coagulopathy is massive fibrin formation. In comparison with bacterial‐sepsis‐associated coagulopathy/DIC, prolongation of prothrombin time, and activated partial thromboplastin time, and decrease in antithrombin activity is less frequent and thrombocytopenia is relatively uncommon in COVID‐19. The mechanisms of the coagulopathy are not fully elucidated, however. It is speculated that the dysregulated immune responses orchestrated by inflammatory cytokines, lymphocyte cell‐death, hypoxia, and endothelial damage are involved. Bleeding tendency is uncommon, but the incidence of thrombosis in COVID‐19 and the adequacy of current recommendations regarding standard venous thromboembolic dosing are uncertain.","Iba, Toshiaki; Levy, Jerrold H.; Levi, Marcel; Thachil, Jecko",J Thromb Haemost,231,20

Accordingly, it has been hypothesized to have a protective effect against COVID-19. Recent research found that countries with universal BCG childhood vaccination policies tend to be less affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. However, such ecological studies are biased by numerous confounders. Instead, this paper takes advantage of a rare nationwide natural experiment that took place in Sweden in 1975, where discontinuation of newborns BCG vaccination led to a dramatic fall of the BCG coverage rate, thus allowing us to estimate the BCG’s effect without the biases associated with cross-country comparisons. METHODS: Numbers of COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations were recorded for birth cohorts born just before and just after 1975, representing 1,026,304 and 1,018,544 individuals, respectively. We used regression discontinuity to assess the effect of BCG vaccination on Covid-19 related outcomes. This method used on such a large population allows for a high precision that would be hard to achieve using a randomized controlled trial. RESULTS: The odds ratio for Covid-19 cases and Covid-19 related hospitalizations were 1·0005 (CI95: [0·8130-1·1881]) and 1·2046 (CI95: [0·7532-1·6560]), allowing us to reject fairly modest effects of universal BCG vaccination. We can reject with 95% confidence that universal BCG vaccination reduces the number of cases by 19% and the number of hospitalizations by 25%. CONCLUSIONS: While the effect of a recent vaccination must be evaluated, we provide strong evidence that receiving the BCG vaccine at birth does not have a protective effect against COVID-19 among middle-aged individuals.","de Chaisemartin, Clément; de Chaisemartin, Luc",Clin Infect Dis,231,30

The factors associated with such fear remains relatively unstudied among older adults. We investigated if fear of COVID-19 could be associated with a combination of psychological factors such as anxiety and depressive symptoms, and risk perception of COVID-19, and demographic factors in a community sample of older adults. Older adults (N = 413, M(age) = 69.09 years, SD = 5.45) completed measures of fear of COVID-19, anxiety and depressive symptoms, and risk perception of COVID-19, during a COVID-19 lockdown. These variables, together with demographics, were fitted to a structural equation model. Anxiety and depressive symptoms were highly correlated with each other and were combined into the higher order latent variable of affective symptoms for analyses. The final model revealed that fear of COVID-19 was positively associated with psychological factors of affective symptoms and risk perception. Older age was associated with greater fear of COVID-19. Our findings showed that fear of COVID-19 can be a projection of pre-existing affective symptoms and inflated risk perceptions and highlighted the need to address the incorrect risk perceptions of COVID-19 and socio-affective issues among older adults in the community.","Han, Madeline F.

Given that meningitis can be fatal and many meningitis cases occurred in high-poverty areas, a simple, low-cost, highly sensitive method is in great need for immediate and early diagnosis of meningitis. Herein, we report a versatile and cost-effective polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS)/paper hybrid microfluidic device integrated with loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) for the rapid, sensitive, and instrument-free detection of the main meningitis-causing bacteria, Neisseria meningitidis (N. meningitidis). The introduction of paper into the microfluidic device for LAMP reactions enables stable test results over a much longer period of time than a paper-free microfluidic system. This hybrid system also offers versatile functions, by providing not only on-site qualitative diagnostic analysis (i.e., a yes or no answer), but also confirmatory testing and quantitative analysis in laboratory settings. The limit of detection of N. meningitidis is about 3 copies per LAMP zone within 45 min, close to single-bacterium detection sensitivity. In addition, we have achieved simple pathogenic microorganism detection without a laborious sample preparation process and without the use of centrifuges. This low-cost hybrid microfluidic system provides a simple and highly sensitive approach for fast instrument-free diagnosis of N. meningitidis in resource-limited settings. This versatile PDMS/paper microfluidic platform has great potential for the point of care (POC) diagnosis of a wide range of infectious diseases, especially for developing nations.","Dou, Maowei; Dominguez, Delfina C.; Li, XiuJun; Sanchez, Juan; Scott, Gabriel",Anal Chem,231,5

METHODS: The PSA (Kit: Immunoassay Program- Cycle 18, Siemens Atellica IM Analyzer) levels in patients who had had a PSA check at least 3 months, but no more than 6 months, prior to diagnosis of acute COVID-19 infection, were examined retrospectively. PSA levels were measured and recorded from these patients on the first day of diagnosis of COVID-19. These patients were called back for urology outpatient follow-up at the 3rd month after the end of the COVID-19 treatment. PSA levels measured in the pre-COVID-19 period, during the period of active infection with COVID-19 and in the post-COVID-19 period were compared. RESULTS: In total, 91 patients had a serum PSA level of 1.58±1.09 ng/ml in the pre-COVID-19 period, a serum PSA level of 4.34±3.78 ng/ml measured in the COVID-19 period and 2.09±2.70 ng/ml in the post-COVID-19 period. It was determined that the serum PSA level measured during active COVID-19 infection was statistically significantly higher than the PSA levels measured according to the pre-COVID-19 period and the post-COVID-19 period (p<0.001, p<0.001; respectively). CONCLUSIONS: SARS-CoV-2 infection in men diagnosed with BPH causes significant increases in PSA levels during the active period of the disease. Measurement of PSA values used in the diagnosis, differential diagnosis, and follow-up of prostate diseases in the acute period of infection and in the early period after infection treatment may cause false evaluations that may affect the diagnosis and treatment steps of prostate diseases in these patients.","Cinislioglu, Ahmet Emre; Demirdogen, Saban Oguz; Cinislioglu, Nazan; Altay, Mehmet Sefa; Sam, Emre; Akkas, Fatih; Tor, Ibrahim Hakki; Aydin, Hasan Riza; Karabulut, Ibrahim; Ozbey, Isa",Urology,231,18

At the molecular level, clock genes form feedback inhibition loops that control 24-hr oscillations throughout the body. Importantly, core clock genes also regulate microglia, the brain resident immune cell, suggesting circadian regulation of neuroimmune function. To assess whether circadian disruption induces neuroimmune and associated behavioral changes, we mimicked chronic jetlag with a chronic phase advance (CPA) model. 32 adult male C57BL/6J mice underwent 6-hr light phase advance shifts every 3 light/dark cycles (CPA) 14 times or were maintained in standard light/dark cycles (control). CPA mice showed higher behavioral despair but not anhedonia in forced swim and sucrose preferences tests, respectively. Changes in behavior were accompanied by altered hippocampal circadian genes in CPA mice. Further, CPA suppressed expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-1 beta in the hippocampus. Plasma corticosterone concentrations were elevated by CPA, suggesting that CPA may suppress neuroimmune pathways via glucocorticoids. These results demonstrate that chronic circadian disruption alters mood and neuroimmune function, which may have implications for shift working populations such as frontline health workers.","Chen, Ruizhuo; Weitzner, Aidan S.; McKennon, Lara A.; Fonken, Laura K.",Brain Behav Immun Health,231,16

Even though the Mexican Endovascular Reperfusion Registry (MERR) and the RESILIENT trial have demonstrated the feasibility of EVT of AIS in Latin America, the MERR has uncovered potential challenges to delivering EVT to AIS patients. Aim: To identify the perceived barriers to access EVT for AIS in Mexico. Methods: We surveyed endovascular neurologists in Mexico. The survey addressed the situation of thrombectomy in the country and the infrastructure and resources available in the participants' institutions. The questionnaire inquired about costs, barriers, and challenges to accessing EVT for AIS, emphasizing the prices and availability of medical devices needed for EVT. Results: We analyzed data from 21 hospitals. The most extreme identified barriers to access EVT were the lack of health coverage for EVT in the National Health System, the cost of the medical supplies for EVT, and inadequate knowledge of stroke symptoms in the general population. The median cost for EVT was USD 20,000 (IQR 7,500–20,000). From this amount, 60% (IQR 50–70%) corresponded to the costs involved with medical devices. EVT carried additional out-of-pocket costs in 90% of the hospitals, and in 57%, the costs exceed USD $10,000. Conclusion: Efforts at all government levels and society are required to tackle these barriers. An increase in and efficient use of public funding for EVT coverage and the deployment of continuous and targeted stroke education campaigns could reduce inequities in EVT access in Mexico.","Gongora-Rivera, Fernando; Gonzalez-Aquines, Alejandro; Marquez-Romero, Juan Manuel",Front Neurol,231,1

Patients with chronic liver diseases (CLD), particularly cirrhosis, hepatobiliary malignancies, candidates for liver transplantation, and immunosuppressed individuals after liver transplantation appear to be at increased risk of infections in general, which in turn translates into increased mortality. This is also the case for SARS-CoV-2 infection, where patients with cirrhosis, in particular, are at high risk of a severe COVID-19 course. Therefore, vaccination against various pathogens including SARS-CoV-2, administered as early as possible in patients with CLD, is an important protective measure. However, due to impaired immune responses in these patients, the immediate and long-term protective response through immunisation may be incomplete. The current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has led to the exceptionally fast development of several vaccine candidates. A small number of these SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidates have already undergone phase III, placebo-controlled, clinical trials in healthy individuals with proof of short-term safety, immunogenicity and efficacy. However, although regulatory agencies in the US and Europe have already approved some of these vaccines for clinical use, information on immunogenicity, duration of protection and long-term safety in patients with CLD, cirrhosis, hepatobiliary cancer and liver transplant recipients has yet to be generated. This review summarises the data on vaccine safety, immunogenicity, and efficacy in this patient population in general and discusses the implications of this knowledge on the introduction of the new SARS-CoV-2 vaccines.","Cornberg, Markus; Buti, Maria; Eberhardt, Christiane S.; Grossi, Paolo Antonio; Shouval, Daniel",J Hepatol,231,21

One challenge is that health care professionals are at high risk of infection themselves. Therefore, in-person visits need to be reduced to an absolute minimum. Connected care solutions, including telehealth, remote patient monitoring, and secure communications between clinicians and their patients, may rapidly become the first choice in such public health emergencies. OBJECTIVE: The aim of the COVID-19 Caregiver Cockpit (C19CC) was to implement a free-of-charge, web- and app-based tool for patient assessment to assist health care professionals working in the COVID-19 environment. METHODS: Physicians in Argentina, Germany, Iran, Italy, Portugal, Switzerland, and the United States explained their challenges with COVID-19 patient care through unstructured interviews. Based on the collected feedback, the first version of the C19CC was built. In the second round of interviews, the application was presented to physicians, and more feedback was obtained. RESULTS: Physicians identified a number of different scenarios where telemedicine or connected care solutions could rapidly improve patient care. These scenarios included outpatient care, discharge management, remote tracking of patients with chronic diseases, as well as incorporating infected physicians under quarantine into telehealth services. CONCLUSIONS: The C19CC is the result of an agile and iterative development process that complements the work of physicians. It aims to improve the care and safety of people who are infected by COVID-19.","Schinköthe, Timo; Gabri, Mariano Rolando; Mitterer, Manfred; Gouveia, Pedro; Heinemann, Volker; Harbeck, Nadia; Subklewe, Marion",JMIR Public Health Surveill,231,29

Methods We reviewed subarachnoid hemorrhage cases of patients who were also SARS-CoV-2-positive at five high-volume cerebrovascular centers in the U.S from March 2020 to January 2021. Cases of aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage were analyzed. Results A total of ten patients were identified, consisting of five women (50%) and five men (50%). Median age was 38.5 years. Four of the ten patients (40%) were asymptomatic with respect to SARS-CoV-2-related symptoms, three patients (30%) had mild-to-moderate symptoms, and three patients (30%) had severe COVID, with pneumonia and sepsis. Of the ten cases, four had dissecting pseudoaneurysms (40%), three in the posterior circulation and one in the anterior circulation. Among six saccular/blister aneurysms, four (67%) were ≤4 mm in largest diameter.

We aimed to describe the clinical presentation of COVID-19 among frail and nonfrail older hospitalised patients and to evaluate the potential association between frailty and clinical course, decision of treatment level with outcomes change in functional capacity and survival. METHODS: We performed a multi-center, retrospective cross-sectional cohort study examining data on clinical presentation and frailty-related domains for hospitalised people aged 75 + years with a positive severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) test. Frailty was assessed at admission using record-based MPI (rMPI) and Clinical Frailty Scale (CFS). Decision on treatment level about invasive ventilation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), change in CFS-score from admission to discharge, changed need of home care, and in-hospital, 30-day and 90-day mortality were registered. RESULTS: 100 patients (median age 82 years (IQR 78–86), 56% female) with COVID-19 were included. 54 patients were assessed moderately or severely frail (rMPI-score = 2 or 3) and compared to non-frail (rMPI-score = 1). At admission, frail patients presented more frequently with confusion. At discharge, functional decline measured by change in CFS and increased home care was more prevalent among frail than the non-frail. Decisions about no invasive ventilation or CPR were more prevalent among frail older patients with COVID-19 than non-frail. Ninety-day mortality was 70% among frail patients versus 15% in non-frail. CONCLUSION: Frailty seems to be associated with confusion, more frequent decisions about treatment level, larger functional decline at discharge and a higher mortality rate among older patients with COVID-19.","Verholt, Ane Borgbjerg; Gregersen, Merete; Gonzalez-Bofill, Nuria; Hansen, Troels K.; Ebdrup, Lotte; Foss, Catherine H.; Lietzen, Lone Winther",Eur Geriatr Med,231,1

SARS‐CoV‐2 infection is characterized by the development and progression of inflammatory responses. Hematological parameters, such as white blood cells (WBCs) and their subpopulations, red cell distribution width, platelet count, mean platelet volume, plateletcrit, and derived markers such as neutrophil‐to‐lymphocyte ratio (NLR), platelet‐to‐lymphocyte ratio (PLR), and lymphocyte‐to‐monocyte ratio, are established biomarkers of inflammatory responses. We aimed to investigate associations between hematological parameters and disease severity in patients with SARS‐CoV‐2 infection. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed data from 68 patients with confirmed SARS‐CoV‐2 infection. Twenty‐two patients had mild illness, and 46 had moderate or severe illness at the time of admission. Univariate and multivariate regression analyses were used to identify correlates of disease severity. The areas under receiver operating characteristic curves were calculated to estimate and compare the predictive values of different diagnostic markers. RESULTS: Mean lymphocyte and monocyte counts were lower while WBC counts, neutrophil counts, NLR, and PLR were higher in patients with severe disease compared with those with mild disease (all P < .01). Univariate analysis revealed that older age, high WBC counts, high neutrophil counts, high NLR, high PLR, low monocyte counts, and low lymphocyte counts were independent correlates of severe illness. Multivariate analysis identified high NLR as the only independent correlate of severe illness. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis showed that NLR had the highest area under curve of all hematological parameters. CONCLUSION: Among hematological parameters, the NLR showed superior prediction of disease severity in patients with SARS‐CoV‐2 infection. Thus, the NLR could be a valuable parameter to complement conventional measures for identification of patients at high risk for severe disease.","Lin, Sha; Mao, Weilin; Zou, Qianda; Lu, Siming; Zheng, Shufa",J Clin Lab Anal,231,28

Inhaled NO (iNO) acts as a selective pulmonary artery vasodilator, alleviating lung ventilation/perfusion ratio. However, Lotz and colleagues assume that improved oxygenation is not the sole reason for survival benefits in patients treated with iNO, suggesting other modes of iNO action could have beneficial effects on systemic circulation. This may indeed be the case, because iNO has a wide range of systemic effects that reduce vascular endothelial inflammation, in addition to local pulmonary effects.2,3.","Kobayashi, Jun",Acta Anaesthesiol Scand,231,16

In response to this crisis, and in an effort to prevent such a tragedy from occurring again, the Canadian blood system has undergone substantial reform. Variant Creutzfeldt–Jakob (vCJD) disease was the first infectious threat faced by the blood system since undergoing reform. The response at the time to this risk provides insights into the Canadian blood system's new approach to infectious threats. Our analysis of the decision-making concerning vCJD identifies two dominant themes characterizing the new blood system's approach to safety: (1).. the adoption of a precautionary approach to new risks which involves taking action in advance of definitive evidence, and (2).. risk aversion amongst policy makers, which has contributed to the adoption of safety measures with comparatively high cost-effectiveness ratios. Overall the principles governing the new blood system have contributed to the system both providing protection against emerging infectious risks and regaining the confidence of the public and recipients. However, the current set of policy factors will likely contribute to increasingly risk-averse policy making that will contribute to continued increases in the cost of the blood system. The challenge the blood system now faces is to find the appropriate balance between maximizing safety and ensuring the system remains affordable.","Wilson, Kumanan; Graham, Ian; Ricketts, Maura; Dornan, Christopher; Laupacis, Andreas; Hebert, Paul",Soc Sci Med,231,22

The precise aim of this study was to assess the impact of ongoing online education on current university students’ FAD and psychological stress symptoms following one year of calamitous COVID-19 outbreak in Bangladesh. METHODS: A cross-sectional web-based survey was conducted from March 15 to 30, 2021, for data collection through a snowball simple sampling technique among Bangladeshi University students, where a total of 1,299 respondents (age: ≥ 18 years) responded in the questionnaire. After obtaining informed consent from the participants, we evaluated the association of various sociodemographic factors and the effects of current e-Learning activities on FAD and subsequent psychological distress among university students in Bangladesh. After excluding the partial responses (n = 177), we analyzed the clean data sheet (n = 1,122) by three consecutive statistical methods: univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analyses. RESULTS: Alarmingly, near 60% of the current students exerted extreme FAD and were suffering from severe stress. Besides, 78.1% of students having severe FAD were severely psychologically stressed. Logistic regression analyses revealed that the students of the female gender, rural area, lower-income families, and who suffered from the highest FAD were more significantly (p < 0.05) stressed than their reference groups. CONCLUSION: The current analysis demonstrates that most Bangladeshi university students are battling with the unrivaled trend of FAD and facing severe psychological stress symptoms, which must be alleviated by the concerted efforts of the Government, Universities, and educationalists.","Hossain, Md.

Our goal was to describe clinical outcomes of COVID-19 inpatients regarding the presence of abnormal liver tests and CLD. METHODS: A retrospective analysis of patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection, hospitalized in a tertiary center in Portugal, was performed. Studied outcomes were disease and hospitalization length, COVID-19 severity, admission to intensive care unit (ICU) and mortality, analyzed by the presence of abnormal liver tests and CLD. RESULTS: We included 317 inpatients with a mean age of 70.4 years, 50.5% males. COVID-19 severity was moderate to severe in 57.4% and critical in 12.9%. The mean disease length was 37.8 days, the median hospitalization duration 10.0 days and overall mortality 22.8%. At admission, 50.3% showed abnormal liver tests, and 41.5% showed elevated aminotransferase levels, from which 75.4% were mild. Elevated aminotransferase levels at admission were associated with COVID-19 severity (78.7 vs. 63.3%, p = 0.01), ICU admission (13.1 vs. 5.92%, p = 0.034) and increased mortality (25.8 vs. 13.3%, p = 0.007). However, in a subgroup analysis, only aspartate transaminase (AST) was associated with these worse outcomes. Alkaline phosphatase was elevated in 11.4% of the patients and was associated with critical COVID-19 (21.1 vs. 9.92%, p = 0.044) and mortality (20.4 vs. 9.52%, p = 0.025), while 24.6% of the patients showed elevated γ-glutamyl transferase, which was associated with ICU admission (42.3 vs. 22.8%, p = 0.028). Fourteen patients had baseline CLD (4.42%), 3 with liver cirrhosis. Alcohol (n = 6) and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (n = 6) were the most frequent etiologies. CLD patients had critical COVID-19 in 21.4% (p = 0.237), mean disease length of 36.6 days (p = 0.291), median hospitalization duration of 11.5 days (p = 0.447) and a mortality rate of 28.6% (p = 0.595), which increased to 66.7% among cirrhotic patients (p = 0.176). CONCLUSIONS: Liver test abnormalities in COVID-19 patients were frequent but most commonly mild. AST, but not alanine transaminase, was associated with worse clinical outcomes, such as COVID-19 severity and mortality, probably indicating these outcomes were independent of liver injury. A low prevalence of CLD was seen, and a clear impact on COVID-19 outcomes was not seen.","Garrido, Mónica; Pereira Guedes, Tiago; Alves Silva, Joana; Falcão, Daniela; Novo, Inês; Archer, Sara; Rocha, Marta; Maia, Luís; Sarmento-Castro, Rui; Pedroto, Isabel",GE Port J Gastroenterol,231,18

The aim of this study was to examine how U.K. general practitioners (GPs) might use oral steroids and antibiotics in such situations. The timing of follow-up and use of self-management plans were also examined. A postal questionnaire was sent to all 205 GP principals in Bath Health District, U.K. in February and March 1993. Respondents were asked questions regarding the management of an adult and a child presenting with acute asthma associated with respiratory tract infection. Replies were received from 185 of 205 (90%) doctors approached. Antibiotics would have been prescribed by 119 of 179 (66%) doctors for the adult and 98 of 169 (58%) doctors for the child. The modal initial dosage of oral prednisolone was 40 mg for the adult and 30 mg for the child, and modal duration of oral steroid dosage was 5 days for both adult and child. Planned follow-up was mainly doctor initiated within 24 h of initial consultation. There was low reported use of self-management plans (49% for adults and 33% in children over 7 years of age). Antibiotic prescription appears to be common practice by GPs when faced with an acute asthma attack associated with respiratory tract infection. There may also be inadequate duration of oral steroid courses in adults. There is a need to examine further the proper role, if any, of antibiotics in such situations, to determine the optimum dose and course length of oral steroid therapy, and to continue validating the use of self-management plans in acute asthma management.","Jones, K.; Gruffydd-Jones, K.",Respiratory Medicine,231,20

We conducted two questionnaire surveys among these clinics within 17 months and another during the coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak to assess adjustments of the developing network to the pandemic. Out of 68 HFCs comprising the network, 52 participated in the first survey and 55 in the second survey. The median number of patients assessed per week is 10. Changes in engaged personnel were encountered between the two surveys, along with increasing use of advanced echocardiographic techniques (23.1% in 2018 vs. 34.5% in 2020). Drawbacks were encountered, concerning magnetic resonance imaging and ergospirometry use (being available in 14.6% and 29% of HFCs, respectively), exercise rehabilitation programmes (applied only in 5.5%), and telemedicine applications (used in 16.4%). There are 13 COCs in the country with nine of them in the capital region; the median number of patients being assessed per week is 10.

Coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak affected provision of HFC services dramatically as only 18.5% continued to function regularly, imposing hurdles that need to be addressed, at least temporarily, possibly by alternative methods of follow‐up such as remote consultation. The function of COCs, in contrast, seemed to be much less affected during the pandemic (77% of them continued to follow up their patients).

RECENT FINDINGS: The latest research endorses telemedicine as a successful strategy in resource-limited settings to provide accessible and equitable healthcare. SUMMARY: Telemedicine was initiated in India in 2001. The pandemic restrictions resulted in an increase in its use. The national telemedicine and telepsychiatry guidelines facilitated and enabled its widespread use. Telehealth was used by private and public health establishments, in urban, rural, and remote areas. It was used for triaging cases; managing and monitoring COVID patients in home isolation, in non-COVID medical and psychiatric care, and follow-up; continuing medical education; and health promotion strategies like teleyoga. The shortcomings included inability to provide privacy and confidentiality, perform physical examination, and provide emergency care. Most patients and their caregivers expressed satisfaction with telehealth services. Telemedicine is likely to become an integral part of healthcare services in the post pandemic era.","Galagali, Preeti M.; Ghosh, Sreyoshi; Bhargav, Hemant",Curr Pediatr Rep,231,1

It has long been proposed that the former tune for recognition of pathogens or groups of pathogens. To experimentally evaluate this within the human antibody repertoire, we perform immune challenges in transgenic mice that bear diverse human CDR3 and light chains but are constrained to different human V(H)(-)genes. We find that, of six commonly deployed V(H) sequences, only those CDRs encoded by IGHV1-2(∗)02 enable polyclonal antibody responses against bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) when introduced to the bloodstream. The LPS is from diverse strains of gram-negative bacteria, and the V(H)-gene-dependent responses are directed against the non-variable and universal saccrolipid substructure of this antigen. This reveals a broad-spectrum anti-LPS response in which germline-encoded CDRs naturally hardwire the human antibody repertoire for recognition of a conserved microbial target.","Sangesland, Maya; Yousif, Ashraf S.; Ronsard, Larance; Kazer, Samuel W.; Zhu, Alex Lee; Gatter, G.

Animal modeling has been critical for addressing MS pathogenesis. The three most characterized animal models of MS are (1) the experimental autoimmune/allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE); (2) the virally-induced chronic demyelinating disease, known as Theiler׳s murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV) infection and (3) the toxin-induced demyelination. All these models, in a complementary way, have allowed to reach a good knowledge of the pathogenesis of MS. Specifically, EAE is the model which better reflects the autoimmune pathogenesis of MS and is extremely useful to study potential experimental treatments. Furthermore, both TMEV and toxin-induced demyelination models are suitable for characterizing the role of the axonal injury/repair and the remyelination process in MS. In conclusion, animal models, despite their limitations, remain the most useful instrument for implementing the study of MS.","Procaccini, Claudio; De Rosa, Veronica; Pucino, Valentina; Formisano, Luigi; Matarese, Giuseppe",Eur J Pharmacol,231,1

We aimed to determine the clinical consequences and etiologies of jaundice in patients with COVID‐19. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed clinical features, laboratory abnormalities, and rates of survival and intensive care unit admission in 551 patients with COVID‐19, hospitalized between 1 March 2020, and 31 May 2020 at a tertiary care academic medical center. Hepatic jaundice was defined as a serum total bilirubin concentration >2.5 mg/dL and a direct bilirubin concentration >0.3 mg/dL that was >25% of the total. Liver injury was characterized as cholestatic, mixed, or hepatocellular at the time of peak serum total bilirubin concentration by calculating the R factor. RESULTS: Hepatic jaundice was present in 49 (8.9%) patients and associated with a mortality rate of 40.8% and intensive care unit admission rate of 69.4%, both significantly higher than for patients without jaundice. Jaundiced patients had an increased frequency of fever, leukopenia, leukocytosis, thrombocytopenia, hypotension, hypoxemia, elevated serum creatinine concentration, elevated serum procalcitonin concentration, and sepsis. Nine jaundiced patients had isolated hyperbilirubinemia. Of the 40 patients with abnormally elevated serum alanine aminotransferase or alkaline phosphatase activities, 62.5% had a cholestatic, 20.0% mixed, and 17.5% hepatocellular pattern of liver injury. CONCLUSION: Hepatic jaundice in patients with COVID‐19 is associated with high mortality.

Different coating and surface treatments and their reported root-mean-square roughness in the literature were extracted and investigated in this study to calculate the refractive index sensing performance parameters, including sensitivity, full width at half maximum, plasmonic dip intensity, plasmonic dip position, and figure of merit. Here, we propose a figure-of-merit equation considering optical intensity contrast and signal-to-noise ratio. The proposed figure-of-merit equation could predict a similar refractive index sensing performance compared to experimental results reported in the literature. The surface roughness height strongly affected all the performance parameters, resulting in a degraded figure of merit for surface plasmon resonance measurement.","Treebupachatsakul, Treesukon; Shinnakerdchoke, Siratchakrit; Pechprasarn, Suejit",Sensors (Basel),231,1

Barriers to implementation and outcomes were also surveyed. METHOD: The 26-question survey, a mixture of multiple choice and free-text, was developed by the Journal of Wound Care projects team, in consultation with ConvaTec, and distributed globally via email and online; the survey was open for just over 12 weeks. Due to the exploratory nature of the research, non-probability sampling was used. The authors reviewed the outputs of the survey to draw conclusions from the data, with the support of a medical writer. RESULTS: There were 1478 respondents who agreed to the use of their anonymised aggregated data. Nearly 90% were from the US or UK, and the majority worked in wound care specialist roles, equally distributed between community and acute care settings; 66.6% had been in wound care for more than 8 years. The respondents work across the spectrum of wound types. More than half (57.4%) had heard of the concept of wound hygiene, of whom 75.3% have implemented it; 78.7% answered that they 'always' apply wound hygiene and 20.8% 'sometimes' do so. The top three barriers to adoption were confidence (39.0%), the desire for more research (25.7%) and competence (24.8%). Overall, following implementation of wound hygiene, 80.3% reported that their patients' healing rates had improved. CONCLUSION: Respondents strongly agreed that implementing wound hygiene is a successful approach for biofilm management and a critical component for improving wound healing rates in hard-to-heal wounds. However, the barriers to its uptake and implementation demonstrate that comprehensive education and training, institutional support for policy and protocol changes, and more clinical research are needed to support wound hygiene.","Murphy, Chris; Atkin, Leanne; Hurlow, Jenny; Swanson, Terry; de Ceniga, Melina Vega",J Wound Care,231,1

Most of these reports did not account for natural variation in these rates. We aimed to evaluate variations in preterm birth and stillbirth rates before and during the COVID-19 pandemic in Ontario, Canada. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study using linked population health administrative databases of pregnant people giving birth in any hospital in Ontario between July 2002 and December 2020. We calculated preterm birth and stillbirth rates. We assessed preterm birth at 22–28, 29–32 and 33–36 weeks’ gestation, and stillbirths at term and preterm gestation. We used Laney control P′ charts for the 18-year study period (6-mo observation periods) and interrupted time-series analyses for monthly rates for the most recent 4 years. RESULTS: We evaluated 2 465 387 pregnancies, including 13 781 that resulted in stillbirth. The mean preterm birth rate for our cohort was 7.96% (range 7.32%–8.59%). From January to December 2020, we determined that the preterm birth rate in Ontario was 7.87%, with no special cause variation. The mean stillbirth rate for the cohort was 0.56% (range 0.48%–0.70%). From January to December 2020, the stillbirth rate was 0.53%, with no special cause variation. We did not find any special cause variation for preterm birth or stillbirth subgroups. We found no changes in slope or gap between prepandemic and pandemic periods using interrupted time-series analyses. INTERPRETATION: In Ontario, Canada, we found no special cause variation (unusual change) in preterm birth or stillbirth rates, overall or by subgroups, during the first 12 months of the COVID-19 pandemic compared with the previous 17.5 years.","Shah, Prakesh S.; Ye, Xiang Y.; Yang, Jie; Campitelli, Michael A.",CMAJ,231,8

Even though both have a serious impact, no study has been done in Ethiopia. Therefore, this study aimed to assess and compare the prevalence of depression and associated factors among normal and overweight reproductive-age women in Debre Berhan town. METHODS: A community-based comparative cross-sectional study was conducted from April– June 2020. Patient health questionnaire-9 was used to measure the level of depression and list of threatening experience for stressful life events. Body mass index values of 18.5–24.9 and 25–29.9 kg/m(2) were used to classify as normal, and overweight, respectively. The data were entered into Epi Data V. 4.6 and were analyzed using SPSS V. 25. A statistically significant association was declared at a p-value < 0.05. RESULTS: From 1530 participants the response rate were 96.1% and 100% for normal and overweight women, respectively. The prevalence of depression among normal weight women was 26.02% (95% CI: 23.3%, 28.73%) whereas among overweight was 32.89% (95% CI: 28.85%, 36.93%). For women who have normal weight; being exposed to stressful life events, having poor social support, and body image disturbance were statistically significant factors. For women who have overweight, stressful life events, body image disturbance, and experienced weight stigma were significantly associated. CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATION: Depression among overweight women was high compared to normal weight in Debre Berhan town. Promoting social support at any aspect of health care services are very important to minimize depression. Especially for overweight women, encouraging management of medical illness, coping mechanisms for different stressful life events and potentiating self-confidence towards body image are a vital means to prevent depression.

Patients with this disease may be more prone to venous or arterial thrombosis because of the activation of many factors involved in it, including inflammation, platelet activation and endothelial dysfunction. Interferon gamma inducible protein-10 (IP-10), monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) and macrophage inflammatory protein 1-alpha (MIP1α) are cytokines related to thrombosis. Therefore, this study focused on these three indicators in COVID-19, with the hope to find biomarkers that are associated with patients’ outcome. METHODS: This is a retrospective single-center study involving 74 severe and critically ill COVID-19 patients recruited from the ICU department of the Tongji Hospital in Wuhan, China. The patients were divided into two groups: severe patients and critically ill patients. The serum IP-10, MCP-1 and MIP1α level in both groups was detected using the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kit. The clinical symptoms, laboratory test results, and the outcome of COVID-19 patients were retrospectively analyzed. RESULTS: The serum IP-10 and MCP-1 level in critically ill patients was significantly higher than that in severe patients (P < 0.001). However, no statistical difference in MIP1α between the two groups was found. The analysis of dynamic changes showed that these indicators remarkably increased in patients with poor prognosis. Since the selected patients were severe or critically ill, no significant difference was observed between survival and death. CONCLUSIONS: IP-10 and MCP-1 are biomarkers associated with the severity of COVID-19 disease and can be related to the risk of death in COVID-19 patients.","Chen, Yu; Wang, Jinglan; Liu, Chenxi; Su, Longxiang; Zhang, Dong; Fan, Junping; Yang, Yanli; Xiao, Meng; Xie, Jing; Xu, Yingchun; Li, Yongzhe; Zhang, Shuyang",Mol Med,231,5

A Systematic Review,14.31011,7.1695547,2021-02-01,"Interferon-induced transmembrane proteins (IFITMs) restrict infections by many viruses, but a subset of IFITMs enhance infections by specific coronaviruses through currently unknown mechanisms. Here we show that SARS-CoV-2 Spike-pseudotyped virus and genuine SARS-CoV-2 infections are generally restricted by expression of human IFITM1, IFITM2, and IFITM3, using both gain- and loss-of-function approaches. Mechanistically, restriction of SARS-CoV-2 occurred independently of IFITM3 S-palmitoylation sites, indicating a restrictive capacity that is distinct from reported inhibition of other viruses. In contrast, the IFITM3 amphipathic helix and its amphipathic properties were required for virus restriction. Mutation of residues within the human IFITM3 endocytosis-promoting YxxΦ motif converted human IFITM3 into an enhancer of SARS-CoV-2 infection, and cell-to-cell fusion assays confirmed the ability of endocytic mutants to enhance Spike-mediated fusion with the plasma membrane. Overexpression of TMPRSS2, which reportedly increases plasma membrane fusion versus endosome fusion of SARS-CoV-2, attenuated IFITM3 restriction and converted amphipathic helix mutants into strong enhancers of infection. In sum, these data uncover new pro- and anti-viral mechanisms of IFITM3, with clear distinctions drawn between enhancement of viral infection at the plasma membrane and amphipathicity-based mechanisms used for endosomal virus restriction. Indeed, the net effect of IFITM3 on SARS-CoV-2 infections may be a result of these opposing activities, suggesting that shifts in the balance of these activities could be coopted by viruses to escape this important first line innate defense mechanism.","Shi, Guoli; Kenney, Adam D.; Kudryashova, Elena; Zhang, Lizhi; Hall-Stoodley, Luanne; Robinson, Richard T.; Kudryashov, Dmitri S.; Compton, Alex A.; Yount, Jacob S.",bioRxiv,231,1

Though extensive research works have been reported in recent days on the development of effective therapeutics against this global health crisis, there is still no approved therapy against SARS-CoV-2. In the present study, plant-synthesized secondary metabolites (PSMs) have been prioritized to make a review focusing on the efficacy of plant-originated therapeutics for the treatment of COVID-19. Plant metabolites are a source of countless medicinal compounds, while the diversity of multidimensional chemical structures has made them superior to treat serious diseases. Some have already been reported as promising alternative medicines and lead compounds for drug repurposing and discovery. The versatility of secondary metabolites may provide novel antibiotics to tackle MDR (Multi-Drug Resistant) microbes too. This review attempted to find out plant metabolites that have the therapeutic potential to treat a wide range of viral pathogens. The study includes the search of remedies belonging to plant families, susceptible viral candidates, antiviral assays, and the mode of therapeutic action; this attempt resulted in the collection of an enormous number of natural therapeutics that might be suggested for the treatment of COVID-19. About 219 plants from 83 families were found to have antiviral activity. Among them, 149 plants from 71 families were screened for the identification of the major plant secondary metabolites (PSMs) that might be effective for this pandemic. Our investigation revealed that the proposed plant metabolites can serve as potential anti- SARS-CoV-2 lead molecules for further optimization and drug development processes to combat COVID-19 and future pandemics caused by viruses.

Although anti-TNF biologics have been used in clinic, they render several drawbacks, such as patients’ progressive immunodeficiency and loss of response, high cost, and intravenous administration. In order to find new potential anti-TNF small molecule inhibitors, we employed an in silico approach, aiming to find natural products, analogs of Ampelopsin H, a compound that blocks the formation of TNF active trimer. Two out of nine commercially available compounds tested, Nepalensinol B and Miyabenol A, efficiently reduced TNF-induced cytotoxicity in L929 cells and production of chemokines in mice joints’ synovial fibroblasts, while Nepalensinol B also abolished TNF-TNFR1 binding in non-toxic concentrations. The binding mode of the compounds was further investigated by molecular dynamics and free energy calculation studies, using and advancing the Enalos Asclepios pipeline. Conclusively, we propose that Nepalensinol B, characterized by the lowest free energy of binding and by a higher number of hydrogen bonds with TNF, qualifies as a potential lead compound for TNF inhibitors’ drug development. Finally, the upgraded Enalos Asclepios pipeline can be used for improved identification of new therapeutics against TNF-mediated chronic inflammatory diseases, providing state-of-the-art insight on their binding mode.","Papadopoulou, Dimitra; Drakopoulos, Antonios; Lagarias, Panagiotis; Melagraki, Georgia; Kollias, George; Afantitis, Antreas",Int J Mol Sci,231,1

Although most of these mutations are expected to be inconsequential, some mutations in the spike protein structure have been hypothesized to affect the critical stage at which the virus invades human cells, which could affect transmission probability and disease expression. If true, then we expect an increased growth rate of reported COVID-19 cases in regions dominated by viruses with these altered proteins. We modeled early global infection dynamics based on clade assignment along with other demographic and meteorological factors previously found to be important. Clade, but not variant D614G which has been associated with increased viral load, enhanced our ability to describe early COVID-19 growth dynamics. Including clade identity in models significantly improved predictions over earlier work based only on weather and demographic variables. In particular, higher proportions of clade 19A and 19B were negatively correlated with COVID-19 growth rate, whereas higher proportions of 20A and 20C were positively correlated with growth rate. A strong interaction between the prevalence of clade 20C and relative humidity suggests that the impact of clade identity might be more important when coupled with certain weather conditions. In particular, 20C an 20A generate the highest growth rates when coupled with low humidity. Projections based on data through April 2020 suggest that, without intervention, COVID-19 has the potential to grow more quickly in regions dominated by the 20A and 20C clades, including most of South and North America.","Corcoran, D.; Urban, M.

After 10 days of lung‐protective ventilation, the patient was weaned from ECMO and the chest drain was removed on the following day with no major comorbidities. CONCLUSION: The combination of ECMO with lung rest strategy could be a treatment option for intractable pneumothorax with COVID‐19 to avoid unnecessary surgical procedures and aerosol generation.","Nakatsutsumi, Keita; Sekiya, Kosuke; Urushibata, Nao; Hosoi, Marie; Arai, Hirokuni; Nagaoka, Eiki; Fujiwara, Tatsuki; Morishita, Koji; Aiboshi, Junichi; Otomo, Yasuhiro",Acute Med Surg,231,1

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty-eight critically ill and laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients who were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) of Sakarya University, Medical Faculty were included in the study. Patients were divided into 2 groups: patients who received anti-A antibody (Ab) containing CP (BG O and B) and those who did not receive CP containing anti-A Ab (BG A and AB). RESULTS: Among the 28 patients, 13 patients received anti-A Ab containing CP (BG; B: 6, O: 7) and 15 patients did not receive anti-A Ab CP (BG; A: 13, AB: 2). Duration in ICU, the rates of mechanical ventilation (MV) support and vasopressor support, the case fatality rate, and the discharge rate were lower in patients who received CP containing anti-A Ab than not containing anti-A Ab CP. However, only the difference in the rate of MV support achieved statistically significance (P = 0.04) CONCLUSION: In our study, it was observed that the efficiency of CP without anti-A antibody was lower than that of plasma containing anti-A antibody, although it was not statistically significant. This result is thought to be due to the anti-A antibody’s ability to block the ACE2 receptor. We believe that this hypothesis should be investigated in controlled studies with higher patient numbers.","HACIBEKİROĞLU, Tuba; KALPAKÇI, Yasin; GENÇ, Ahmet Cihad; HACIBEKİROĞLU, İlhan; SUNU, Cenk; SARICAOĞLU, Adem; TOMAK, Yakup; KARABAY, Oğuz; KÖROĞLU, Mehmet",Turk J Med Sci,231,16

Proposed risk factors for viral infection, as well as the rate of disease progression, include age, sex, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cancer, and cigarette smoking. To investigate whether the proposed risk factors increase viral infection by modulation of the VE genes, we examined gene expression profiles of 796 nasal and 1,673 bronchial samples across four lung cancer screening cohorts containing individuals without COVID-19. Smoking was the only clinical factor reproducibly associated with the expression of any VE gene across cohorts. ACE2 expression was significantly up-regulated with smoking in the bronchus but significantly down-regulated with smoking in the nose. Furthermore, expression of individual VE genes were not correlated between paired nasal and bronchial samples from the same patients. Single-cell RNA-seq of nasal brushings revealed that an ACE2 gene module was detected in a variety of nasal secretory cells with the highest expression in the C15orf48+ secretory cells, while a TMPRSS2 gene module was most highly expressed in nasal keratinizing epithelial cells. In contrast, single-cell RNA-seq of bronchial brushings revealed that ACE2 and TMPRSS2 gene modules were most enriched in MUC5AC+ bronchial goblet cells. The CTSL gene module was highly expressed in immune populations of both nasal and bronchial brushings. Deconvolution of bulk RNA-seq showed that the proportion of MUC5AC+ goblet cells was increased in current smokers in both the nose and bronchus but proportions of nasal keratinizing epithelial cells, C15orf48+ secretory cells, and immune cells were not associated with smoking status. The complex association between VE gene expression and smoking in the nasal and bronchial epithelium revealed by our results may partially explain conflicting reports on the association between smoking and SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Xu, K.; Shi, X.; Husted, C.; Hong, R.; Wang, Y.; Ning, B.; Sullivan, T.; Rieger-Christ, K.

Prior U.S. research has found that religious conservatism is positively associated with anti-vaccine attitudes. One of the strongest predictors of anti-vaccine attitudes in the U.S. is Christian nationalism—a U.S. cultural ideology that wants civic life to be permeated by their particular form of nationalist Christianity. However, there are no studies examining the relationship between Christian nationalism and COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy and uptake. Using a new nationally representative sample of U.S. adults, we find that Christian nationalism is one of the strongest predictors of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy and is negatively associated with having received or planning to receive a COVID-19 vaccine. Since Christian nationalists make up approximately 20 percent of the population, these findings could have important implications for achieving herd immunity.","Corcoran, Katie E.; Scheitle, Christopher P.; DiGregorio, Bernard D.",Vaccine,231,20

However, evidence supporting this notion is currently lacking. In this study, we conducted a survey on the risk of COVID-19 in patients with MS and NMOSD. METHODS: The survey was conducted through the Chinese Medical Network for Neuroinflammation. Patients in 10 MS centers from 8 cities including Wuhan were included. Information about MS and NMOSD disease duration and the usage of DMDs were collected. Data of suspected cases of COVID-19 were obtained from hospital visits, questionnaires, and patient self-reporting. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection was confirmed through clinical evaluation by a panel of experts in conjunction with chest CT and viral RNA detection. RESULTS: Eight hundred eighty-two of 1,804 (48.89%) patients with MS and 2,129 of 3,060 (69.58%) patients with NMOSD were receiving DMDs. There were no alterations in the patients' DMD regimen during January 15, 2020, to March 15, 2020, the 3-month period. None of the patients with MS treated with DMDs had COVID-19. However, 2 patients with relapsing NMOSD were diagnosed with COVID-19-related pneumonia. After treatment, both patients recovered from pneumonia and neither patient experienced new attacks due to predisposing SARS-CoV-2 infection in the following 2 months. CONCLUSIONS: No increased risk of COVID-19 infection was observed in patients with MS or NMOSD, irrespective of whether these patients received DMDs. A battery of stringent preventive measures adopted by neurologists to reduce COVID-19 infection in these patients may have contributed to low risk of COVID-19 infection.","Fan, Moli; Qiu, Wei; Bu, Bitao; Xu, Yan; Yang, Huan; Huang, Dehui; Lau, Alexander Y.; Guo, Jun; Zhang, Mei-Ni; Zhang, Xinghu; Yang, Chun-Sheng; Chen, Jingshan; Zheng, Pei; Liu, Qiang; Zhang, Chao; Shi, Fu-Dong",Neurol Neuroimmunol Neuroinflamm,231,1

At present, rapid and reliable methods to detect and measure the concentrations of this pathogen are needed. The objectives of the survey are developing the real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to identify and quantify the BRSV RNA and, based on it, determining the number of the virus genomes in the respiratory tract of sick animals during the disease outbreaks. The nucleocapsid (N) protein gene of the virus served as the target for amplification. Messenger RNA (mRNA) of bovine GAPDH was used as a reference gene. A panel of positive control samples at known concentrations was used to estimate the virus and GAPDH numbers. The concentration of viral RNA extracted from the biomaterial samples was quantified relative to the bovine GAPDH mRNA level. The analytical sensitivity of PCR demonstrating high specificity and reproducibility was 1 × 10(3) genome equivalents per 1 cm(3). All 273 samples of biological material taken from the animals with the respiratory diseases were analyzed. The virus genome was detected in 19.4% of samples. The viral RNA was more frequently detected in the lungs, which comprised 10.61% of positive samples. It was less frequently found in the mucous membranes of trachea and bronchi and the lymph nodes of the lungs, which comprised 0.73% of positive samples each. Concentrations of the virus in samples varied. The highest concentration was recorded in the lungs (1.3 ± 0.5—4.8 ± 0.47 log(10) copies of BRSV/GAPDH RNA). The developed test kit may be used to quantify the concentration of the bovine respiratory syncytial virus in disease pathogenesis and to estimate the efficiency of vaccine or antivirus preparations for animals.","Nefedchenko, A.

However, evidence indicates that CME is often poorly developed and inappropriately used. Consequently, there has been increasing interest in the literature in evaluating wider contexts at play in CME development and delivery. In this article, the authors present a unified theoretical framework, grounded in learning theories, to explore the role of contextual factors in public health CME for health care practitioners. Discussion with pedagogical experts together with a narrative review of learning theories within medical and social science literature informed the framework's development. The need to consider sociocultural theories of learning within medical education restricted suitable theories to those that recognized contexts beyond the individual learner; adopted a systems approach to evaluate interactions between contexts and learner; and considered learning as more than mere acquisition of knowledge. Through a process of rigorous critical analysis, two theoretical models emerged as contextually appropriate: Biggs principle of constructive alignment and Bronfenbrenner bioecological model of human development. Biggs principle offers theoretical clarity surrounding interactive factors that encourage lifelong learning, whereas the Bronfenbrenner model expands on these factor's roles across multiple system levels. The authors explore how unification into a single framework complements each model while elaborating on its fundamental and practical applications. The unified theoretical framework presented in this article addresses the limitations of isolated frameworks and allows for the exploration of the applicability of wider learning theories in CME research.","Roux, Thomas L.; Heinen, Mirjam M.; Murphy, Susan P.; Buggy, Conor J.",J Contin Educ Health Prof,231,1

Activation of the complement system typically occurs via three main pathways and can induce various antimicrobial effects, including: neutralization of pathogens, regulation of inflammatory responses, promotion of chemotaxis, and enhancement of the adaptive immune response. These can be vital host responses to protect against acute, chronic, and recurrent viral infections. Consequently, many viruses (including dengue virus, West Nile virus and Nipah virus) have evolved mechanisms for evasion or dysregulation of the complement system to enhance viral infectivity and even exacerbate disease symptoms. The complement system has multifaceted roles in both innate and adaptive immunity, with both intracellular and extracellular functions, that can be relevant to all stages of viral infection. A better understanding of this virus-host interplay and its contribution to pathogenesis has previously led to: the identification of genetic factors which influence viral infection and disease outcome, the development of novel antivirals, and the production of safer, more effective vaccines. This review will discuss the antiviral effects of the complement system against numerous viruses, the mechanisms employed by these viruses to then evade or manipulate this system, and how these interactions have informed vaccine/therapeutic development.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The paper is based on our experience in routine inpatient palliative care and partial results of a study conducted as part of the collaborative project “National Strategy for Palliative Care in Pandemic Times (PallPan)”. Based on our experience from the inpatient care of patients suffering from severe or life-limiting disease, best-practice examples for improving or maintaining care in the on-going pandemic are described. RESULTS: Restrictive visitor regulations, communication barriers and insufficient possibilities to accompany dying patients or their grieving relatives continue to pose major challenges in general and specialized inpatient palliative care. In order to maintain high-quality palliative care, it is necessary to create structures that enable targeted therapy discussions and end-of-life care in the presence of relatives. Therefore, innovative communication methods like video calls or individualized exceptions from visitor restrictions are needed.

Methods: Electronic laboratory, patient and staff self-reported sickness records were interrogated for the period 1st March to 18th April 2020. HA-COVID-19 was defined as symptom onset >14d of admission. Test performance of a single combined throat and nose swab (CTNS) for patient placement and the effect of delayed RNA positivity (DRP, defined as >48h delay) on patient outcomes was evaluated. The incidence of staff self-reported COVID-19 sickness absence, hospital bed occupancy, community incidence and DRP was compared HA-COVID-19. The incidence of other significant hospital-acquired bacterial infections (OHAI) was compared to previous years. Results: 58 HA-COVID-19 (7.1%) cases were identified. As compared to community-acquired cases, significant differences were observed in age (p=0.018), ethnicity (p<0.001) and comorbidity burden (p<0.001) but not in 30d mortality. CTNS negative predictive value was 60.3%. DRP was associated with greater mortality (p=0.034) and 34.5% HA-COVID-19 cases could be traced to delayed diagnosis in CA-COVID-19. Incidence of HA-COVID-19 correlated positively with DRP (R=0.7108) and staff sickness absence (R=0.7815). OHAI rates were similar to previous 2 years. Conclusion: Early diagnosis and isolation of COVID-19 would help reduce transmission.

Molecular testing turnaround time precludes having results at the point‐of‐care (POC) thereby exposing COVID‐19/Non‐COVID‐19 patients while awaiting diagnosis. We evaluated the utility of a triage strategy including FebriDx, a 10‐minute POC finger‐stick blood test that differentiates viral from bacterial acute respiratory infection through detection of Myxovirus‐resistance protein A (MxA) and C‐reactive protein (CRP), to rapidly isolate viral cases requiring confirmatory testing. METHODS: This observational, prospective, single‐center study enrolled patients presenting to/within an acute care hospital in England with suspected COVID‐19 between March and April 2020. Immunocompetent patients ≥16 years requiring hospitalisation with pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome or influenza‐like illness (fever and ≥1 respiratory symptom within 7 days of enrolment, or inpatients with new respiratory symptoms, fever of unknown cause or pre‐existing respiratory condition worsening). The primary endpoint was diagnostic performance of FebriDx to identify COVID‐19 as a viral infection; secondary endpoint was SARS‐CoV‐2 molecular test diagnostic performance compared with the reference standard COVID‐19 Case Definition (molecular or antibody detection of SARS‐CoV‐2). RESULTS: Valid results were available for 47 patients. By reference standard, 35 had viral infections (34/35 COVID‐19; 1/35 non‐COVID‐19; overall FebriDx viral sensitivity 97.1% (95%CI 83.3‐99.9)). Of the COVID‐19 cases, 34/34 were FebriDx viral positive (sensitivity 100%; 95%CI 87.4‐100); 29/34 had an initial SARS‐CoV‐2 positive molecular test (sensitivity 85.3%; 95%CI 68.2‐94.5). FebriDx was viral negative when the diagnosis was not COVID‐19 and SARS‐Cov‐2 molecular test was negative (negative predictive value (NPV) 100% (13/13; 95%CI 71.7‐100)) exceeding initial SARS‐CoV‐2 molecular test NPV 72.2% (13/19; 95%CI 46.4‐89.3).

MAIN: While immunotherapies in non-small cell lung cancer and melanoma led to practice changing therapies, the same therapies had only modest benefit for patients with other malignancies, such as mesothelioma and glioblastoma. One way to improve on current immunotherapies is to alter the sequence of each combination agent. Matching the immunotherapy to the host’s immune response may thus improve the activity of the current treatments. A second approach is to combine current immunotherapies with novel agents targeting complementary mechanisms. Identifying the appropriate novel agents may require different approaches than the traditional laboratory-based discovery work. For example, artificial intelligence-based research may help focusing the search for innovative and most promising combination partners. CONCLUSION: Novel immunotherapies are needed in cancer patients with resistance to or relapse after current immunotherapeutic drugs. Such new treatments may include targeted agents or monoclonal antibodies to overcome the immune-suppressive tumor microenvironment. The mode of combining the novel treatments, including vaccines, needs to be matched to the patient’s immune status for achieving the maximum benefit. In this scenario, specific attention should be also paid nowadays to the immune intersection between COVID-19 and cancer.","Maio, Michele; Lahn, Michael; Di Giacomo, Anna Maria; Covre, Alessia; Calabrò, Luana; Ibrahim, Ramy; Fox, Bernard",J Exp Clin Cancer Res,231,30

In recent years, mRNA vaccines have been proposed as the new frontier in vaccination, owing to their facile and rapid development while providing a safer alternative to traditional vaccine technologies such as live or attenuated viruses. Recent breakthroughs in mRNA vaccination have been through formulation with lipid nanoparticles (LNPs), which provide both protection and enhanced delivery of mRNA vaccines in vivo. In this review, current paradigms and state-of-the-art in mRNA-LNP vaccine development are explored through first highlighting advantages posed by mRNA vaccines, establishing LNPs as a biocompatible delivery system, and finally exploring the use of mRNA-LNP vaccines in vivo against infectious disease towards translation to the clinic.

Their preferment was rapid due to the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic. The process of conducting exams online is being opted as the appropriate way of assessment, ensuring the students’ safety and well-being. According to Warts et al., this form of examination has been pretty effective in the past when blended with the conventional assessment. However, at present, implemented as the singular way of assessment, e-exams have shown a more significant promise in being beneficial to the learners. As a matter of fact, a comprehensive analysis on understanding the learners’ perception towards the e-exams was not done earlier, particularly in the developing nations. Thus, it was pertinent to examine the pre-requisites of e-exams to promote it as a useful tool for the smooth conduct of exams in the aforesaid nations. Against such a backdrop, this study was conducted during January to March 2021 on 207 students enrolled in four universities, three situated in the National Capital Territory (NCT) of Delhi, India: Delhi University (DU), Jamia Millia Islamia (JMI), and Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU), and one situated in Saudi Arabia, namely Saudi Electronic University (SEU). A quantitative approach was employed for the study, with the responses recorded via web questionnaires. Confirmatory -factor analysis (CFA) was applied in the study to examine whether the process of conducting online examinations is being chosen as the appropriate form of assessment, ensuring the safety and well-being of students through AMOS (version 24) software. For determining the reliability of the two latent constructs, namely “Perceptions of students towards E-exams (PSE)” and “Pre-requisites of E-exams (POE),” Cronbach’s alpha was used through SPSS (version 25) software in the study, and the results reveal that the strong internal consistency exists between all the measured variables.

The outcome also applies to the authenticity of grading and the overall efficiency concerning the time, effort, and expenditure on conducting the examination. Contrarily, the participating students also recognized numerous hurdles in implementing e-exams concerning security, validity, and impartiality. The conclusion further revealed that online examination is especially relevant for formative assessment of learning instead of summative assessment, provided authenticity, security, and flexibility are used as fundamental tenants in the proper implementation of e-exams. The outcome of the present study will facilitate higher education institutions and policymakers in taking the electronic examination system to the next level.","Khan, Mohammed Arshad; Vivek, Vivek; Khojah, Maysoon; Nabi, Mohammed Kamalun; Paul, Mohinder; Minhaj, Syed Mohd.",Int J Environ Res Public Health,231,11

The augmentation of the basis sets with diffuse functions showed a marked effect on the profile and barriers of the NO(2) torsional potential. Depending on the applied model chemistry, the heterocyclic ring in some 2-NPOs has proved to be non-planar. The non-planarity of the ring was characterized by Cremer–Pople puckering amplitude Q. The disruption of the ring planarity in some NPOs was accounted for the distinctive reactivity and impact sensitivity of these heterocycles. Consistently, the NBO and the AIM analyses furnished clear evidence for the accentuated weakness of the C–NO(2) bond and provided evidence for the electronic interplay between the NO(2) group, the fluorine substituent and the heterocyclic ring. Deletion of all off-diagonal Fock-matrix elements (NOSTAR) to separate hyperconjugative stabilizing interactions from steric interactions was used. The effect of nitration and fluorination on the aromaticity of the studied 2-NPOs was investigated by using the NICS descriptors NICS(1) and NICS(1)(zz). These NICS indices have shown that the fluorination in para position to the nitro group exhibits the highest degree of aromaticity within the fluorinated 2-NPOs.

In this retrospective cohort study, data were obtained from the electronic medical records at the Sheba Medical Center. Folic acid levels were available in 333 out of 1020 consecutive patients diagnosed with COVID-19 infection hospitalized from January 2020 to November 2020. Thirty-eight (11.4%) of the 333 patients comprising the present study population had low folate levels. No significant difference was found in the incidence of acute kidney injury, hypoxemia, invasive ventilation, length of hospital stay, and mortality be-tween patients with decreased and normal-range folate levels. When sub-dividing the study population according to quartiles of folate levels, similar findings were observed. In conclusion, decreased serum folate levels are common among hospitalized patients with COVID-19, but there was no association between serum folate levels and clinical outcomes. Due to the important role of folate in cell metabolism and the potential pathologic impact when deficient, a follow-up of folate levels or possible supplementation should be encouraged in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Fur-ther studies are required to assess the prevalence and consequences of folate deficiency in COVID-19 patients.","Meisel, Eshcar; Efros, Orly; Bleier, Jonathan; Beit Halevi, Tal; Segal, Gad; Rahav, Galia; Leibowitz, Avshalom; Grossman, Ehud",Nutrients,231,18

It is one of the greatest public health challenges in modern times, with no proven cure or vaccine. In this paper, our focus is on a fractional order approach to modeling and simulations of the novel COVID-19. We introduce a fractional type susceptible–exposed–infected–recovered (SEIR) model to gain insight into the ongoing pandemic. Our proposed model incorporates transmission rate, testing rates, and transition rate (from asymptomatic to symptomatic population groups) for a holistic study of the coronavirus disease. The impacts of these parameters on the dynamics of the solution profiles for the disease are simulated and discussed in detail. Furthermore, across all the different parameters, the effects of the fractional order derivative are also simulated and discussed in detail. Various simulations carried out enable us gain deep insights into the dynamics of the spread of COVID-19. The simulation results confirm that fractional calculus is an appropriate tool in modeling the spread of a complex infectious disease such as the novel COVID-19. In the absence of vaccine and treatment, our analysis strongly supports the significance reduction in the transmission rate as a valuable strategy to curb the spread of the virus. Our results suggest that tracing and moving testing up has an important benefit. It reduces the number of infected individuals in the general public and thereby reduces the spread of the pandemic. Once the infected individuals are identified and isolated, the interaction between susceptible and infected individuals diminishes and transmission reduces. Furthermore, aggressive testing is also highly recommended.","Owusu-Mensah, Isaac; Akinyemi, Lanre; Oduro, Bismark; Iyiola, Olaniyi S.",Adv Differ Equ,231,1

The strength of the intermolecular interactions is evaluated in term of energy decomposition of the total interaction energy ΔE(int) between molecules, which are mainly governed by electrostatic interactions. The HOMO–LUMO gaps explain that the possible charge transfer interactions that take place within the molecules are responsible for the molecular reactivity of the studied molecules. The chemical hardness, the chemical potential and the electrophilicity indexes are good indicators for biological activities showing their improvement to that of cinnamon itself.

The appraisal of historical spatiotemporal changes and possible future changes in heat index (HI) is essential for developing heat stress mitigation strategies. However, the climate-health nexus studies in Bangladesh are very limited. This study was intended to appraise the historical and projected changes in HI in Bangladesh. The HI was computed from daily dry bulb temperature and relative humidity. The modified Mann-Kendal (MMK) test and linear regression were used to detect trends in HI for the observed period (1985–2015). The future change in HI was projected for the mid-century (2041–2070) for three Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) scenarios, RCP 2.6, 4.5, and 8.5 using the Canadian Earth System Model Second Generation (CanESM2). The results revealed a monotonic rise in the HI and extreme caution conditions, especially in the humid summer season for most parts of Bangladesh for the observed period (1985–2015). Future projections revealed a continuous rise in HI in the forthcoming period (2041–2070). A higher and remarkable increase in the HI was projected in the northern, northeastern, and south-central regions. Among the three scenarios, the RCP 8.5 showed a higher projection of HI both in hot and humid summer compared to the other scenarios. Therefore, Bangladesh should take region-specific adaptation strategies to mitigate the impacts of HI.

However, there is a lack of first-hand data on i) comparative efficacy of various treatment processes for SARS-CoV-2 RNA removal; and ii) temporal variations in the removal efficacy of a given treatment process in the backdrop of active COVID-19 cases. This work provides a comparative account of the removal efficacy of conventional activated sludge (CAS) and root zone treatments (RZT) based on weekly wastewater surveillance data, consisting of forty-four samples, during a two-month period. The average genome concentration was higher in the inlets of CAS-based wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) in the Sargasan ward (1.25 × 10(3) copies/ L), than that of RZT-based WWTP (7.07 × 10(2) copies/ L) in an academic institution campus of Gandhinagar, Gujarat, India. ORF 1ab and S genes appeared to be more sensitive to treatment i.e., significantly reduced (p < 0.05) than N genes (p > 0.05). CAS treatment exhibited better RNA removal efficacy (p = 0.014) than RZT (p = 0.032). Multivariate analyses suggested that the effective genome concentration should be calculated based on the presence/absence of multiple genes. The present study stresses that treated effluents are not always free from SARS-CoV-2 RNA, and the removal efficacy of a given WWTP is prone to exhibit temporal variability owing to variations in active COVID-19 cases in the vicinity and genetic material accumulation over the time. Disinfection seems less effective than the adsorption and coagulation processes for SARS-CoV-2 removal. Results stress the need for further research on mechanistic insight on SARS-CoV-2 removal through various treatment processes taking solid–liquid partitioning into account.","Kumar, Manish; Kuroda, Keisuke; Joshi, Madhvi; Bhattacharya, Prosun; Barcelo, Damia",Chem Eng J,231,20

However, whether this is caused by direct viral infection of the endothelium or inflammation-induced endothelial activation remains highly contentious. Methods Here, we use patient autopsy samples, primary human endothelial cells and an in vitro model of the pulmonary epithelial-endothelial cell barrier to show that primary human endothelial cells express very low levels the SARS-CoV-2 receptor ACE2 and the protease TMPRSS2. Results Accordingly, endothelial cells can only be infected when SARS-CoV-2 is present at very high concentrations. However, this is not a productive infection (i.e. no infectious virus is produced) and viral entry induces an inflammatory response. We also show that SARS-CoV-2 does not infect endothelial cells in 3D vessels under flow conditions. We further demonstrate that in a co-culture model endothelial cells are not infected with SARS-CoV-2. They do however sense and respond to infection in the adjacent epithelial cells, increasing ICAM-1 expression and releasing pro-inflammatory cytokines. Conclusions Taken together, these data suggest that in vivo, endothelial cells are unlikely to be infected with SARS-CoV-2 and that infection is only likely to occur if the adjacent pulmonary epithelium is denuded (basolateral infection) or a high viral load is present in the blood (apical infection). In such a scenario, whilst SARS-CoV-2 infection of the endothelium can occur, it does not contribute to viral amplification. However, endothelial cells are still likely to play a key role in SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis by sensing adjacent infection and mounting a pro-inflammatory response to SARS-CoV-2.","Schimmel, Lilian; Chew, Keng Yih; Stocks, Claudia; Yordanov, Teodor; Essebier, Patricia; Kulasinghe, Arutha; Monkman, James; Miggiolaro, Anna Flavia Ribeiro dos Santos; Cooper, Caroline; de Noronha, Lucia; Lagendijk, Anne K.; Schroder, Kate; Labzin, Larisa I.; Gordon, Emma J.; Short, Kirsty R.",bioRxiv,231,17

Herein, the journey of hot electrons in a solid-state multimetallic photocatalyst is revealed by a combination of ultrafast visible and infrared spectroscopy. Dynamics showed that electrons formed upon silver plasmonic excitation reach the gold catalytic site within 700 fs and the electron flow could also be reversed. Gold is the preferred site until saturation of its 5d band occurs.

In this research, for the first time, a series of experiments, including modified compaction, unconfined compression strength and resilient modulus tests, were conducted on the blends of different percentages of the shredded face mask (SFM) added to the recycled concrete aggregate (RCA) for road base and subbase applications. The experimental results show that RCA mixed with three different percentages (i.e., 1%, 2% and 3%) of SFM satisfied the stiffness and strength requirements for pavements base/subbase. The introduction of the shredded face mask not only increased the strength and stiffness but also improved the ductility and flexibility of RCA/SFM blends. The inclusion of 1% SFM to RCA resulted in the highest values of unconfined compressive strength (216 kPa) and the highest resilient modulus (314.35 MP).

Among the most urgent tasks is obtaining a detailed understanding of the molecular interactions that facilitate viral replication or contribute to host defense mechanisms in infected cells. While SARS-CoV-2 co-opts cellular factors for viral translation and genome replication, a comprehensive map of the host cell proteome in direct contact with viral RNA has not been elucidated. Here, we use RNA antisense purification and mass spectrometry (RAP-MS) to obtain an unbiased and quantitative picture of the human proteome that directly binds the SARS-CoV-2 RNA in infected human cells. We discover known host factors required for coronavirus replication, regulators of RNA metabolism and host defense pathways, along with dozens of potential drug targets among direct SARS-CoV-2 binders. We further integrate the SARS-CoV-2 RNA interactome with proteome dynamics induced by viral infection, linking interactome proteins to the emerging biology of SARS-CoV-2 infections. Validating RAP-MS, we show that CNBP, a regulator of proinflammatory cytokines, directly engages the SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Supporting the functional relevance of identified interactors, we show that the interferon-induced protein RYDEN suppresses SARS-CoV-2 ribosomal frameshifting and demonstrate that inhibition of SARS-CoV-2-bound proteins is sufficient to manipulate viral replication. The SARS-CoV-2 RNA interactome provides an unprecedented molecular perspective on SARS-CoV-2 infections and enables the systematic dissection of host dependency factors and host defense strategies, a crucial prerequisite for designing novel therapeutic strategies.","Schmidt, Nora; Lareau, Caleb A.; Keshishian, Hasmik; Melanson, Randy; Zimmer, Matthias; Kirschner, Luisa; Ade, Jens; Werner, Simone; Caliskan, Neva; Lander, Eric S.; Vogel, Jörg; Carr, Steven A.; Bodem, Jochen; Munschauer, Mathias",bioRxiv,231,16

Flying-foxes (Pteropus spp.) are large bats that forage by night on floral resources and rest by day in arboreal roosts that may contain colonies of many thousands of individuals. They are the largest mammals capable of powered flight, and are highly mobile, which makes them key seed and pollen dispersers in forest ecosystems. However, their mobility also facilitates transmission of zoonotic diseases and brings them in conflict with humans, and so they require a precarious balancing of conservation and management concerns throughout their Old World range. Here, we analyze the Australia-wide movements of 201 satellite-tracked individuals, providing unprecedented detail on the inter-roost movements of three flying-fox species: Pteropus alecto, P. poliocephalus, and P. scapulatus across jurisdictions over up to 5 years. RESULTS: Individuals were estimated to travel long distances annually among a network of 755 roosts (P. alecto, 1427–1887 km; P. poliocephalus, 2268–2564 km; and P. scapulatus, 3782–6073 km), but with little uniformity among their directions of travel. This indicates that flying-fox populations are composed of extremely mobile individuals that move nomadically and at species-specific rates. Individuals of all three species exhibited very low fidelity to roosts locally, resulting in very high estimated daily colony turnover rates (P. alecto, 11.9 ± 1.3%; P. poliocephalus, 17.5 ± 1.3%; and P. scapulatus, 36.4 ± 6.5%). This indicates that flying-fox roosts form nodes in a vast continental network of highly dynamic “staging posts” through which extremely mobile individuals travel far and wide across their species ranges. CONCLUSIONS: The extreme inter-roost mobility reported here demonstrates the extent of the ecological linkages that nomadic flying-foxes provide across Australia’s contemporary fragmented landscape, with profound implications for the ecosystem services and zoonotic dynamics of flying-fox populations. In addition, the extreme mobility means that impacts from local management actions can readily reverberate across jurisdictions throughout the species ranges; therefore, local management actions need to be assessed with reference to actions elsewhere and hence require national coordination. These findings underscore the need for sound understanding of animal movement dynamics to support evidence-based, transboundary conservation and management policy, tailored to the unique movement ecologies of species.","Welbergen, Justin A.; Meade, Jessica; Field, Hume E.; Edson, Daniel; McMichael, Lee; Shoo, Luke P.; Praszczalek, Jenny; Smith, Craig; Martin, John M.",BMC Biol,231,1

Social distancing measures taken to prevent the spread of the disease have greatly affected the functioning of societies and reduced or halted many activities with a risk of injury. The aim of this study was to report the effects of lockdown measures on trauma-related EMS calls in the Finnish capital area. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of all EMS calls in the Helsinki University Hospital (HUH) catchment area between 1 January and 31 July 2020. Calls were identified from the HUH EMS database. Calls were grouped into pre-lockdown, lockdown, and post-lockdown periods according to the restrictions set by the Finnish government and compared to the mean number of calls for the corresponding periods in 2018 and 2019. Statistical comparisons were performed using Mann-Whitney U-test for weekly numbers and percentages. RESULTS: During the study period there was a total of 70,705 EMS calls, of which 14,998 (21.2%) were related to trauma; 67,973 patients (median age 61.6 years; IQR 35.3–78.6) were met by EMS. There was no significant change in the weekly number of total or trauma-related EMS calls during the pre-lockdown period. During the lockdown period, the number of weekly total EMS calls was reduced by 12.2% (p = 0.001) and the number of trauma-related calls was reduced by 23.3% (p = 0.004). The weekly number of injured patients met by EMS while intoxicated with alcohol was reduced by 41.8% (p = 0.002). During the post-lockdown period, the number of total and trauma-related calls and the number of injured patients intoxicated by alcohol returned to previous years’ levels.

To understand viral disease biology, we have carried out proteo-genomic analysis using next-generation sequencing (NGS) and mass spectrometry on nasopharyngeal swabs of COVID-19 patients to examine the clinical genome and proteome. Our study confirms the mutability of SARS-CoV-2 showing multiple single-nucleotide polymorphisms. NGS analysis detected 27 mutations, of which 14 are synonymous, 11 are missense, and 2 are extragenic in nature. Phylogenetic analysis of SARS-CoV-2 isolates indicated their close relation to a Bangladesh isolate and multiple origins of isolates within the country. Our proteomic analysis, for the first time, identified 13 different SARS-CoV-2 proteins from the clinical swabs. Of the total 41 peptides captured by high-resolution mass spectrometry, 8 matched to nucleocapsid protein, 2 to ORF9b, and 1 to spike glycoprotein and ORF3a, with remaining peptides mapping to ORF1ab polyprotein. Additionally, host proteome analysis revealed several key host proteins to be uniquely expressed in COVID-19 patients. Pathway analysis of these proteins points toward modulation in immune response, especially involving neutrophil and IL-12-mediated signaling. Besides revealing the aspects of host-virus pathogenesis, our study opens new avenues to develop better diagnostic markers and therapeutic approaches.","Tushir, Sheetal; Kamanna, Sathisha; Nath, Sujith S.; Bhat, Aishwarya; Rose, Steffimol; Aithal, Advait R.; Tatu, Utpal",J Proteome Res,231,24

While some hematological abnormalities have been described among the laboratory features of COVID-19, there have not been studies reported on lymphocyte subset analyses in children. The aim of this study was to describe lymphocyte subsets in pediatric patients with mild/moderate or severe COVID-19. Methods: The subjects in the study were children with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pneumonia confirmed with the real-time RT-PCR. The subjects were admitted to the Children's Medical Center, affiliated with the Tehran University of Medical Sciences, between March 7(th) and June 10(th) of 2020. The complete blood counts and lymphocyte subpopulations were analyzed for each patient. Results: The study included 55 hospitalized patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection (34 patients (62%) with an observed mild/moderate case of the disease and 21 patients (38%) with severedisease). Lymphocyte counts were found to be lower in patients with a severe case (mean ± SD 1.6 ± 0.9 in the severe group vs. 2.3 ± 2.2 in the mild group). Compared to the group with mild/moderate pneumonia, children with severe pneumonia had an increased count of CD8(+) T cell and a lower percentage of CD4(+) T cell. However, the differences between the groups were negligible. Interestingly, the severe group had a lower CD4(+)/CD8(+) T cell ratio compared to the mild group (1.1 ± 0.47 vs. 1.4 ± 0.8, p-value: 0.063). CD4(+)/CD8(+) T cell ratio <2, 1.5, and 1 was found in 48 (87%), 40 (73%), and 19 cases (35%). All of the seven cases in which the subject passed (13%) had CD4(+)/CD8(+) T cell ratio of <2, 86% had CD4(+)/CD8(+) T cell ratio of <1.5, and 29% had CD4(+)/CD8(+) T cell ratio of <1. Conclusion: The CD4(+)/CD8(+) T cell ratio was lower in patients with severe COVID-19 compared to those with mild/moderate form of disease. However, although a decline in CD4(+)/CD8(+) ratio may serve as a useful metric in analyzing of the derangement in immune responses in patients with severe COVID-19, further study with larger sample sizes is highly recommended.","Mahmoudi, Shima; Yaghmaei, Bahareh; Sharifzadeh Ekbatani, Meisam; Pourakbari, Babak; Navaeian, Amene; Parvaneh, Nima; Haghi Ashtiani, Mohammad Taghi; Mamishi, Setareh",Front Pediatr,231,16

Global statistics compiled for the severity of damage observed during this seismic event from detailed information gathered from well-documented and detailed damage surveys were used for this purpose. Also, an update is provided on how the seismic reconstruction and recovery processes of the built environment in Mexico City have been after this earthquake. This adaptive resilience has been assessed from reliable information and statistics of the ongoing reconstruction process of the affected built environment in Mexico City. The implementation of structural health monitoring programs for typical, representative buildings within the city would be germane to detect and correct potential structural deficiencies on time before the next strong earthquake may strike, then helping to improve the seismic resilience of the built environment.","Tena-Colunga, A.; Hernández-Ramírez, H.; Godínez-Domínguez, E.

Fever is seen in most cases of COVID-19, at least at the initial stages of illness. Although fever is typically treated (with antipyretics or directly with ice or other mechanical means), increasing data suggest that fever is a protective adaptive response that facilitates recovery from infectious illness. OBJECTIVE: To describe a randomized controlled pilot study of core warming patients with COVID-19 undergoing mechanical ventilation. METHODS: This prospective single-site randomized controlled pilot study will enroll 20 patients undergoing mechanical ventilation for respiratory failure due to COVID-19. Patients will be randomized 1:1 to standard-of-care or to receive core warming via an esophageal heat exchanger commonly utilized in critical care and surgical patients. The primary outcome is patient viral load measured by lower respiratory tract sample. Secondary outcomes include severity of acute respiratory distress syndrome (as measured by PaO2/FiO2 ratio) 24, 48, and 72 hours after initiation of treatment, hospital and intensive care unit length of stay, duration of mechanical ventilation, and 30-day mortality. RESULTS: Resulting data will provide effect size estimates to guide a definitive multi-center randomized clinical trial. ClinicalTrials.gov registration number: NCT04426344. CONCLUSIONS: With growing data to support clinical benefits of elevated temperature in infectious illness, this study will provide data to guide further understanding of the role of active temperature management in COVID-19 treatment and provide effect size estimates to power larger studies.","Bonfanti, Nathaniel; Gundert, Emily; Drewry, Anne M.; Goff, Kristina; Bedimo, Roger; Kulstad, Erik",PLoS One,231,28

(PROSPERO: CRD42020187078) DATA SOURCES: English-language articles in MEDLINE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and Scopus, searched from inception through 31 August 2020. Gray literature sources were searched through 2 November 2020. STUDY SELECTION: Observational studies examining SARS-CoV-2 infections, hospitalizations, or deaths by race/ethnicity in U.S. settings. DATA EXTRACTION: Single-reviewer abstraction confirmed by a second reviewer; independent dual-reviewer assessment of quality and strength of evidence. DATA SYNTHESIS: 37 mostly fair-quality cohort and cross-sectional studies, 15 mostly good-quality ecological studies, and data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and APM Research Lab were included. African American/Black and Hispanic populations experience disproportionately higher rates of SARS-CoV-2 infection, hospitalization, and COVID-19–related mortality compared with non-Hispanic White populations, but not higher case-fatality rates (mostly reported as in-hospital mortality) (moderate- to high-strength evidence). Asian populations experience similar outcomes to non-Hispanic White populations (low-strength evidence). Outcomes for other racial/ethnic groups have been insufficiently studied. Health care access and exposure factors may underlie the observed disparities more than susceptibility due to comorbid conditions (low-strength evidence). LIMITATIONS: Selection bias, missing race/ethnicity data, and incomplete outcome assessments in cohort and cross-sectional studies must be considered. In addition, adjustment for key demographic covariates was lacking in ecological studies. CONCLUSION: African American/Black and Hispanic populations experience disproportionately higher rates of SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19–related mortality but similar rates of case fatality. Differences in health care access and exposure risk may be driving higher infection and mortality rates.

To give a more realistic estimate of the mortality of Covid-19, we use the most recent estimates of the IFR (Infection Fatality Ratio) of epidemic, based on the minimum observed CFR, and furthermore analyse data obtained from the ship Diamond Princess, a good representation of a laboratory case-study from an isolated system in which all the people have been tested. From such analyses we derive more realistic estimates of the real extension of the infection, as well as more accurate indicators of how fast the infection propagates. We then point out from the various explanations proposed, the dominant factors causing such an abnormal seriousness of the disease in Italy.

The ICUs will therefore be confronted with a massive influx of patients (e.g. Spain and Italy). However, if the number of patients is higher than the resources available in ICUs, rationing decisions such as determining and evaluating the criteria for ICU admission becomes essential. In this case, the decision of which patients will be admitted to the ICUs may put significant pressure on healthcare personnel. The goal of this paper is to determine the criteria to be used in the decision of admission of COVID-19 patients to the ICUs. METHODS: A three-step methodology is applied. In the first step, the evaluation criteria are determined, and then the criteria are prioritized using a fuzzy analytical hierarchy process (AHP) in an uncertain and multiple-criteria environment choice. Finally, COVID-19 patients are ranked using the Multi-Objective Optimization Method by Ratio Analysis to find out which patient is more urgent. RESULTS: According to experts’ evaluation of ICU admission criteria, “increment of >2 in SOFA score” seems the most dominant factor among others. The proposed methodology is tested on 10 anonymous COVID-19 positive patients being treated in a public hospital and the ICU admission results are discussed. CONCLUSIONS: Obtained priorities and ranking is in line with the hospitals’ behavior that potentially depicts the usefulness and validity of the proposed approach.","Özkan, Barış; Özceylan, Eren; Kabak, Mehmet; Dikmen, Asiye Uğraş",Comput Methods Programs Biomed,231,1

The aim of this study was to investigate whether physiological respiratory parameters in pre-hospital patients with COVID-19 differed from those without COVID-19 and if they could be used to aid EMS personnel in the prediction of illness severity. METHODS: Patients with suspected COVID-19 were included by EMS personnel in Uppsala, Sweden. A portable respiratory monitor based on pneumotachography was used to sample the included patient’s physiological respiratory parameters. A questionnaire with information about present symptoms and background data was completed. COVID-19 diagnoses and hospital admissions were gathered from the electronic medical record system. The physiological respiratory parameters of patients with and without COVID-19 were then analyzed using descriptive statistical analysis and logistic regression. RESULTS: Between May 2020 and January 2021, 95 patients were included, and their physiological respiratory parameters analyzed. Of these patients, 53 had COVID-19. Using adjusted logistic regression, the odds of having COVID-19 increased with respiratory rate (95% CI 1.000–1.118), tidal volume (95% CI 0.996–0.999) and negative inspiratory pressure (95% CI 1.017–1.152). Patients admitted to hospital had higher respiratory rates (p<0.001) and lower tidal volume (p = 0.010) compared to the patients who were not admitted. Using adjusted logistic regression, the odds of hospital admission increased with respiratory rate (95% CI 1.081–1.324), rapid shallow breathing index (95% CI 1.006–1.040) and dead space percentage of tidal volume (95% CI 1.027–1.159). CONCLUSION: Patients taking smaller, faster breaths with less pressure had higher odds of having COVID-19 in this study. Smaller, faster breaths and higher dead space percentage also increased the odds of hospital admission. Physiological respiratory parameters could be a useful tool in detecting COVID-19 and predicting hospital admissions, although more research is needed.","Mälberg, Johan; Hadziosmanovic, Nermin; Smekal, David",PLoS One,231,17

Avison in Comparison to that of Albert Schweitzer from a Post-Colonial Perspective,14.704231,7.0164237,2020-12-01,"BACKGROUND: Cardiac surgery is a frequently performed procedure. However, pain after cardiac surgery may become chronic (lasting >3 months) in adults. Once discharged from the hospital, patients are at greater risk of developing chronic postsurgical pain (CPSP) and of prolonged opioid use, as they need to self-manage their pain. Psychological risk and protective factors such as pain-related catastrophic thoughts and pain acceptance determine their ability to cope and their use of opioids, which is crucial for self-management of pain. Studies on mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) have multiplied their potential effects on pain acceptance and catastrophic thoughts. However, web-based MBCT for the prevention of CPSP has not yet been examined. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to pilot test a 4-week-long web-based MBCT intervention for adults following discharge from the hospital by assessing the acceptability or feasibility of the intervention and examining preliminary effects on pain intensity, pain interference with activities and opioid use, and pain acceptance and catastrophic thoughts in the 6 months following surgery. METHODS: A double-blinded pilot randomized controlled trial will be used to assess a web-based MBCT intervention. Patients will be selected according to the following criteria: age ≥18 years; first-time elective cardiac surgery via a median sternotomy; worst pain in the past week score ≥4/10; ability to understand and complete questionnaires in English; and ability to use an electronic device such as a smartphone, computer, or tablet. After baseline measures, 32 participants will be randomized into two groups: one receiving both the brief, 4-week-long web-based MBCT intervention and usual care (experimental group) and the other receiving only one standardized, web-based educational session with weekly reminders and usual care (attention control group). Peer-reviewed competitive funding was received from Florida State University’s Council on Research & Creativity in January 2021, as well as research ethics approval from Florida State University's institutional review board. RESULTS: Recruitment began in June 2021. Unfortunately, because of the current COVID-19 pandemic, recruitment is not progressing as expected. Recruitment strategies are constantly monitored and updated according to latest data and restrictions surrounding the pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: This research is significant because it targets the trajectory of CPSP, a leading cause of disability and opioid misuse. This is the first study to assess MBCT for the prevention of CPSP after cardiac surgery in the recovery phase. This approach is innovative because it promotes self-management of pain through the modulation of individual factors. If successful, the intervention could be expanded to numerous populations at risk of chronic pain.

A systematic pan-cancer analysis was conducted to assess the expression pattern and immunological role of ACE2 based on RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) data downloaded from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Next, correlations between ACE2 expression immunological characteristics in the BRCA tumor microenvironment (TME) were evaluated. Also, the role of ACE2 in predicting the clinical features and the response to therapeutic options in BRCA was estimated. These findings were subsequently validated in another public transcriptomic cohort as well as a recruited cohort. ACE2 was lowly expressed in most cancers compared with adjacent tissues. ACE2 was positively correlated with immunomodulators, tumor-infiltrating immune cells (TIICs), cancer immunity cycles, immune checkpoints, and tumor mutation burden (TMB). Besides, high ACE2 levels indicated the triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) subtype of BRCA, lower response to endocrine therapy and higher response to chemotherapy, anti-ERBB therapy, antiangiogenic therapy and immunotherapy. To sum up, ACE2 correlates with an inflamed TME and identifies immuno-hot tumors, which may be used as an auxiliary biomarker for the identification of immunological characteristics in BRCA.","Mei, Jie; Cai, Yun; Xu, Rui; Yu, Xinqian; Chen, Lingyan; Ma, Tao; Gao, Tianshu; Gao, Fei; Zhu, Yichao; Zhang, Yan",bioRxiv,231,1

This marks a unique opportunity to analyze virus spreading and evolution in a worldwide context. Currently, there is not a useful haplotype description to help to track important and globally scattered mutations. Also, differences in the number of sequenced genomes between countries and/or months make it difficult to identify the emergence of haplotypes in regions where few genomes are sequenced but a large number of cases are reported. We propose an approach based on the normalization by COVID-19 cases of relative frequencies of mutations using all the available data to identify major haplotypes. Furthermore, we can use a similar normalization approach to tracking the temporal and geographic distribution of haplotypes in the world. Using 171,461 genomes, we identify five major haplotypes or operational taxonomic units (OTUs) based on nine high-frequency mutations. OTU_3 characterized by mutations R203K and G204R is currently the most frequent haplotype circulating in four of the six continents analyzed (South America, North America, Europe, Asia, Africa, and Oceania). On the other hand, during almost all months analyzed, OTU_5 characterized by the mutation T85I in nsp2 is the most frequent in North America. Recently (since September), OTU_2 has been established as the most frequent in Europe. OTU_1, the ancestor haplotype, is near to extinction showed by its low number of isolations since May. Also, we analyzed whether age, gender, or patient status is more related to a specific OTU. We did not find OTU’s preference for any age group, gender, or patient status. Finally, we discuss structural and functional hypotheses in the most frequently identified mutations, none of those mutations show a clear effect on the transmissibility or pathogenicity.","Justo Arevalo, Santiago; Zapata Sifuentes, Daniela; Huallpa, César J.; Landa Bianchi, Gianfranco; Castillo Chávez, Adriana; Garavito-Salini Casas, Romina; Uceda-Campos, Guillermo; Pineda Chavarria, Roberto",Front Microbiol,231,16

This virus uses the human ACE2 enzyme as receptor for cell entry, recognizing it with the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the S1 subunit of the viral spike protein. We present the use of phage display to select anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike antibodies from the human naïve antibody gene libraries HAL9/10 and subsequent identification of 309 unique fully human antibodies against S1. 17 antibodies are binding to the RBD, showing inhibition of spike binding to cells expressing ACE2 as scFv-Fc and neutralize active SARS-CoV-2 virus infection of VeroE6 cells. The antibody STE73-2E9 is showing neutralization of active SARS-CoV-2 as IgG and is binding to the ACE2-RBD interface. Thus, universal libraries from healthy human donors offer the advantage that antibodies can be generated quickly and independent from the availability of material from recovering patients in a pandemic situation.","Bertoglio, Federico; Meier, Doris; Langreder, Nora; Steinke, Stephan; Rand, Ulfert; Simonelli, Luca; Heine, Philip Alexander; Ballmann, Rico; Schneider, Kai-Thomas; Roth, Kristian Daniel Ralph; Ruschig, Maximilian; Riese, Peggy; Eschke, Kathrin; Kim, Yeonsu; Schäckermann, Dorina; Pedotti, Mattia; Kuhn, Philipp; Zock-Emmenthal, Susanne; Wöhrle, Johannes; Kilb, Normann; Herz, Tobias; Becker, Marlies; Grasshoff, Martina; Wenzel, Esther Veronika; Russo, Giulio; Kröger, Andrea; Brunotte, Linda; Ludwig, Stephan; Fühner, Viola; Krämer, Stefan Daniel; Dübel, Stefan; Varani, Luca; Roth, Günter; Čičin-Šain, Luka; Schubert, Maren; Hust, Michael",Nat Commun,231,26

This study analyzes the geo temporal effects on disease severity for the 1,688 Chinese healthcare workers infected with COVID 19. Method Using the descriptive results recently reported by the Chinese CDC, we compare the percentage of infected healthcare workers in severe conditions over time and across three areas in China, and the fatality rate of infected healthcare workers with all the infected individuals in China aged 22 to 59 years. Results Among the infected Chinese healthcare workers whose symptoms onset appeared during the same ten day period, the percentage of those in severe conditions decreased statistical significantly from 19.7% (Jan 11 to 20) to 14.4% (Jan 21 to 31) to 8.7% (Feb 1 to 11). Across the country, there was also a significant difference in the disease severity among patients symptoms onset during the same period, with Wuhan being the most severe (17%), followed by Hubei Province (10.4%), and the rest of China (7.0%). The case fatality rate for the 1,688 infected Chinese healthcare workers was significantly lower than that for the 29,798 infected patients aged 20 to 59 years 0.3% (5/1,688) vs. 0.65% (193/29,798), respectively. Conclusion The disease severity improved considerably over a short period of time in China. The more severe conditions in Wuhan compared to the rest of the country may be attributable to the draconian lockdown. The clinical outcomes of infected Chinese healthcare workers may represent a more accurate estimation of the severity of COVID 19 for those who have access to quality healthcare.","Gao, Wayne; Sanna, Mattia; Wen, Chi Pang",,231,18

METHODS: This retrospective observational study compared hospital use and mortality in the Brazilian Unified Health System (SUS) in the first six months of the COVID-19 pandemic with the year before the onset of the pandemic in six Brazilian capitals (São Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, Manaus, Fortaleza, Recife, and Brasilia). It was based on secondary administrative data from the SUS Hospital Information System (SIH), focusing on the number of hospitalizations per fortnight, age, and gender of patients, hospital length of stay, and the proportions of surgical, elective, with the use of ICU, and resulting in death hospitalizations. It also compared the number of hospitalizations and mortality related to frequent diagnostic groups. RESULTS: A significant drop was identified in the number of hospitalizations as of March 2020, with the first peak of COVID-19 hospitalizations in five capitals recorded in May 2020. In the six capitals, we observed significant reductions in the mean number of hospitalizations per fortnight from the beginning of the pandemic. We also identified an increase in the mean age of the patients and the proportion of male patients. The proportion of surgical and elective hospitalizations dropped significantly in all capitals, while the proportion of hospitalizations with ICU use increased significantly. Significant increases in-hospital mortality were also recorded in the six capitals with the pandemic, including or excluding COVID-19 hospitalizations from the comparison. CONCLUSION: The pandemic caused changes in the pattern of use and hospital indicators in the first six months in the cities considered, evidencing the need for attention to diseases with a hospital production altered by the COVID-19 course and health system performance problems in the face of challenges.","Portela, Margareth Crisóstomo; de Aguiar Pereira, Claudia Cristina; Lima, Sheyla Maria Lemos; de Andrade, Carla Lourenço Tavares; Martins, Mônica",BMC Health Serv Res,231,6

METHODS: A web-based cross-sectional survey was conducted between 12(th) and 13(th) May 2020. Quota sampling was used to attain equal gender and age distributions representative of the Japanese population. RESULTS: A total of 4,127 complete responses were analysed. Higher educational level (B=0.045, p=0.002) and household income (B=0.04, p=0.009) were associated with a higher increase in preventive measures when comparing before and after the state of emergency was declared. The highest reported social anxiety was a feeling of fear (65.6%), followed by embarrassment (43.8%), keeping infection a secret (41.3%), avoidance (41.3%), and stigma (25.5%). A total of 86.1% of the respondents reported moderate to severe anxiety. The partial least square-based structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM) revealed that being female has the greatest effect (B=0.246, p<0.0001) on higher current preventive measures, followed by social anxiety (B=0.119; p=0.001) and State-Trait Anxiety Inventory scores (B=0.153; p<0.001).

Previous studies on the association of serum uric acid with risk of adverse outcomes related to COVID-19 have produced contradictory results. The precise relationship between admission serum uric acid and adverse outcomes in hospitalized patients is unknown. METHODS: Data of patients affected by laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 and admitted to Leishenshan Hospital were retrospectively analyzed. The primary outcome was composite and comprised events, such as intensive care unit (ICU) admission, mechanical ventilation, or mortality. Logistic regression analysis was performed to explore the association between serum concentrations of uric acid and the composite outcome, as well as each of its components. To determine the association between serum uric acid and in-hospital adverse outcomes, serum uric acid was also categorized by restricted cubic spline, and the 95% confidence interval (CI) was used to estimate odds ratios (OR). RESULTS: The study cohort included 1854 patients (mean age, 58 years; 52% women). The overall mean ± SD of serum levels of uric acid was 308 ± 96 µmol/L. Among them, 95 patients were admitted to ICU, 75 patients received mechanical ventilation, and 38 died. In total, 114 patients reached composite end-points (have either ICU admission, mechanical ventilation or death) during hospitalization. Compared with a reference group with estimated baseline serum uric acid of 279-422 µmol/L, serum uric acid values ≥ 423 µmol/L were associated with an increased risk of composite outcome (OR, 2.60; 95% CI, 1.07- 6.29) and mechanical ventilation (OR, 3.01; 95% CI, 1.06- 8.51). Serum uric acid ≤ 278 µmol/L was associated with an increased risk of the composite outcome (OR, 2.07; 95% CI, 1.18- 3.65), ICU admission (OR, 2.18; 95% CI, 1.17- 4.05]), and mechanical ventilation (OR, 2.13; 95% CI, 1.06- 4.28), as assessed by multivariate analysis. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that the association between admission serum uric acid and composite outcome of COVID-19 patients was U-shaped. In particular, we found that compared with baseline serum uric acid levels of 279-422 µmol/L, values ≥ 423 µmol/L were associated with an increased risk of composite outcome and mechanical ventilation, whereas levels ≤ 278 µmol/L associated with increased risk of composite outcome, ICU admission and mechanical ventilation.","Chen, Bo; Lu, Chenyang; Gu, Hong-Qiu; Li, Yang; Zhang, Guqin; Lio, Jonathan; Luo, Xiongyan; Zhang, Lingshu; Hu, Yidan; Lan, Xiaomeng; Chen, Zerong; Xie, Qibing; Pan, Huaqin",Front Endocrinol (Lausanne),231,5

The research was conducted among 364 medicine students (years 1–5) from the Medical University of Gdańsk, with year-specific curriculum-based general medical knowledge. Training consisted of pre-test, practical training and post-test. Descriptive statistics were used to reveal the characteristics of students from different grades. A Mann–Whitney U test was used for statistical analysis. The tested students did not have sufficient knowledge to provide first aid in cases of anaphylaxis before training. There was an increase in knowledge (on average, 28.6%, p = 0.005) after training. Almost all (99.4%) of the respondents believed that they would be able to use an adrenaline auto-injector in case of emergency after the training.

This article describes the development and validation of a scale to measure JCSE. We conducted a qualitative study to design and four quantitative studies to test the psychometric properties of this scale among Polish and American employees in both paper-and-pencil and online versions. Three independent (N(1) = 364; N(2) = 432; N(3) = 403) confirmatory factor analyses demonstrated a good fit to a 3-factor solution comprising JCSE beliefs about increasing (a) structural job resources, (b) social job resources, and (c) challenging job demands. The 9-item JCSE Scale had good internal consistency, high time stability, and good validity. It correlated positively with general self-efficacy. JCSE explained unique variance in job crafting behaviors over and above general self-efficacy, and was more important in predicting job crafting than contextual factors. We demonstrate the role of social cognitions in shaping job redesign behaviors and provide a useful tool to evaluate the effectiveness of interventions dedicated to empowering JCSE.","Roczniewska, Marta; Rogala, Anna; Puchalska-Kaminska, Malwina; Cieślak, Roman; Retowski, Sylwiusz",PLoS One,231,14

Although there is a significant variation in COVID-19 outbreaks among the US nursing homes, we still do not know why such outbreaks are larger and more likely in some nursing homes than others. This research aims to understand why some nursing homes are more susceptible to larger COVID-19 outbreaks. DESIGN: Observational study of all nursing homes in the state of California until 1 May 2020. SETTING: The state of California. PARTICIPANTS: 713 long-term care facilities in the state of California that participate in public reporting of COVID-19 infections as of 1 May 2020 and their infections data could be matched with data on ratings and governance features of nursing homes provided by Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: The number of reported COVID-19 infections among staff and residents. RESULTS: Study sample included 713 nursing homes. The size of outbreaks among residents in for-profit nursing homes is 12.7 times larger than their non-profit counterparts (log count=2.54; 95% CI, 1.97 to 3.11; p<0.001). Higher ratings in CMS-reported health inspections are associated with lower number of infections among both staff (log count=−0.19; 95% CI, −0.37 to −0.01; p=0.05) and residents (log count=−0.20; 95% CI, −0.27 to −0.14; p<0.001). Nursing homes with higher discrepancy between their CMS-reported and self-reported ratings have higher number of infections among their staff (log count=0.41; 95% CI, 0.31 to 0.51; p<0.001) and residents (log count=0.13; 95% CI, 0.08 to 0.18; p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The size of COVID-19 outbreaks in nursing homes is associated with their ratings and governance features. To prepare for the possible next waves of COVID-19 epidemic, policy makers should use these insights to identify the nursing homes who are more likely to experience large outbreaks.","Gopal, Ram; Han, Xu; Yaraghi, Niam",BMJ Open,231,14

The AusDiagnostics SARS-CoV-2, Influenza and RSV 8-well assay is used at sixteen UK hospitals and detects part of the ORF8 gene (together with a segment from the ORF1a gene). The objective of this study was to determine if the recently identified mutation in ORF8 (G28048T) in the B.1.1.7. lineage could be used to identify the new variant quickly in clinical cases with PCR positive results. The melt data from SARS-CoV-2 positives from two hospitals (October through December 2020) were reviewed, and distribution over time and location was evaluated. A low melt variant of the ORF8 amplicon started to appear in samples from Guy's and St. Thomas’ NHS Trust, London, at the start of November, and grew as a proportion of the total positives during the subsequent two months. These low melt variants were very rare during the same period at the Northern Care Alliance, Greater Manchester, North West of UK. It was confirmed that these carried the G28048T mutation. The geographic and temporal distribution of the low melt amplicons makes it very likely that these are lineage B.1.1.7 strains. The melt temperature of this amplicon could be used to discriminate between the original and new variants in advance of the full sequencing of the isolate. However, the appearance of other mutations in the same amplicon means that this approach would be of diminishing value over time.","Hale, Richard S.; Green, Ashleigh; Cunningham, Emma; Joel, Paul",,231,20

These activities may place the family member at risk from a health care–associated infection. This study aimed to examine whether the role of patients’ families has been accounted for in the infection prevention and control (IPC) guidelines and policy, using examples from Bangladesh (low-income country), Indonesia (middle-income country), and South Korea (high-income country). METHODS: The World Health Organization website and Institutional Repository for Information Sharing, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website, Australian Government Web Archive, Open Grey, Grey Matters, World Bank, and advanced Google search, as well as the Health Department/Ministry of Health websites for each target country and 4 western countries (Australia, Canada, England, and the United States) were searched. Other databases, such as Embase, Medline, CINAHL, Global Health, ProQuest databases, Google scholar, Web of Science, and Scopus were also searched. This was to review the reflection of the cultural influence in IPC policies/guidelines by reviewing those from the global organizations, which are often used as a blueprint for policy development, as well as those from western countries, which hold different cultures in care arrangement. Search was conducted with attention to the key areas: definition and role of carer in the acute health care facility, involvement of patients/family members in IPC activities, patient and family member hand hygiene, and IPC education. RESULTS: Ninety-two articles were identified based on the criteria for the study. Only 6 acknowledged that care is provided to hospitalized patients by their family members, and only 1 recommended that family members receive the same level of training as health care workers on IPC precautions. Other guides recommended the provision of information on IPC measures as means of patient involvement in the IPC program. Recognition of family caregivers or inclusion of them in the IPC strategies was not included in the target countries’ guidelines. CONCLUSIONS: Although health care workers are the primary actors when it comes to providing care in acute health care settings, it is important to expand the IPC guides by considering the role of other caregivers. Policies and guidelines should reflect the cultural influence over healthcare. This is especially true when cultural values strongly influence over healthcare arrangements and the healthcare accommodates these cultural influences in the practice.

In addition to the severe effects of the disease on health, the pandemic caused a negative impact on basic needs and services, employment, education, and economy worldwide. In Jordan, the whole country locked down, and quarantine was enforced by the military forces, which successfully controlled the spread of the disease. This research aims to study the influence of the COVID-19 pandemic and its associated quarantine on university students' beliefs about online learning practice in Jordan. An online descriptive survey involved questions that covered students' demographic information, student's basic and advanced knowledge about COVID-19, students' online learning experience during the quarantine, and finally students' views on the enforced quarantine practice in Jordan. Results showed that students have a good knowledge (>50%) about the COVID-19 basic information and a moderate knowledge (<50%) regarding COVID-19 advanced information. In general, students were pessimistic about the future of COVID-19 both locally and worldwide. Although some students acknowledged that they learned new skills in the fields of electronics, informatics, and computer software during the pandemic, most of them were unsatisfied about the quality and quantity of the given material, online exams, and the evaluation processes. Unfortunately, most of the students faced internet technical problems or challenges to electronic accessibility. The majority of the participants (>90%) supported the military-enforced quarantine implemented in the country despite the hard time the students had during the quarantine. We conclude that university students were able to protect themselves from COVID-19 through their good knowledge about the infectious disease and their commitment to follow the rules imposed by the Government of Jordan. Nevertheless, the challenges caused by the pandemic and its associated quarantine, combined with the sudden unprecedented online experience, negatively impacted students' thoughts and beliefs about the online learning experience during the quarantine. Further studies need to be performed in this context. We hope our results will help decision-makers better understand the students' attitudes and motivation toward online learning and how this will affect their future plans and decisions.","Almomani, Ensaf Y.; Qablan, Ahmad M.; Atrooz, Fatin Y.; Almomany, Abbas M.; Hajjo, Rima M.; Almomani, Huda Y.",Front Public Health,231,20

An excessive host inflammatory response in a subgroup of patients with severe COVID-19 might contribute to the development of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and multiorgan failure. Timely therapeutic intervention with immunomodulation in patients with hyperinflammation could prevent disease progression to ARDS and obviate the need for invasive ventilation. Granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) is an immunoregulatory cytokine with a pivotal role in initiation and perpetuation of inflammatory diseases. GM-CSF could link T-cell-driven acute pulmonary inflammation with an autocrine, self-amplifying cytokine loop leading to monocyte and macrophage activation. This axis has been targeted in cytokine storm syndromes and chronic inflammatory disorders. Here, we consider the scientific rationale for therapeutic targeting of GM-CSF in COVID-19-associated hyperinflammation. Since GM-CSF also has a key role in homoeostasis and host defence, we discuss potential risks associated with inhibition of GM-CSF in the context of viral infection and the challenges of doing clinical trials in this setting, highlighting in particular the need for a patient risk-stratification algorithm.","Mehta, Puja; Porter, Joanna C; Manson, Jessica J; Isaacs, John D; Openshaw, Peter J M; McInnes, Iain B; Summers, Charlotte; Chambers, Rachel C",Lancet Respir Med,231,1

The impact of influenza on outpatient visits, hospital admissions, and deaths has not been fully demonstrated to date in south China. METHODS: A time series Poisson generalized additive model was used to quantitatively assess influenza-like illness (ILI) and influenza disease burden by using influenza surveillance data in Zhuhai City from 2007 to 2009, combined with the outpatient, inpatient, and respiratory disease mortality data of the same period. RESULTS: The influenza activity in Zhuhai City demonstrated a typical subtropical seasonal pattern; however, each influenza virus subtype showed a specific transmission variation. The weekly ILI case number and virus isolation rate had a very close positive correlation (r = 0.774, P < 0.0001). The impact of ILI and influenza on weekly outpatient visits was statistically significant (P < 0.05). We determined that 10.7% of outpatient visits were associated with ILI and 1.88% were associated with influenza. ILI also had a significant influence on the hospitalization rates (P < 0.05), but mainly in populations <25 years of age. No statistically significant effect of influenza on hospital admissions was found (P > 0.05). The impact of ILI on chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) was most significant (P < 0.05), with 33.1% of COPD-related deaths being attributable to ILI. The impact of influenza on the mortality rate requires further evaluation. CONCLUSIONS: ILI is a feasible indicator of influenza activity. Both ILI and influenza have a large impact on outpatient visits. Although ILI affects the number of hospital admissions and deaths, we found no consistent influence of influenza, which requires further assessment.","Guo, Ru-ning; Zheng, Hui-zhen; Ou, Chun-quan; Huang, Li-qun; Zhou, Yong; Zhang, Xin; Liang, Can-kun; Lin, Jin-yan; Zhong, Hao-jie; Song, Tie; Luo, Hui-ming",PLoS One,231,27

Face-to-face healthcare, including psychiatric provision, must continue despite reduced interpersonal contact during the COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus) pandemic. Community-based services might use domiciliary visits, consultations in healthcare settings, or remote consultations. Services might also alter direct contact between clinicians. Aims. We examined the effects of appointment types and clinician-clinician encounters upon infection rates. Methods. We modelled a COVID-19-like disease in a hypothetical community healthcare team, their patients, and patients' household contacts (family). In one condition, clinicians met patients and briefly met family (e.g. home visit or collateral history). In another, patients attended alone (e.g. clinic visit), segregated from each other. In another, face-to-face contact was eliminated (e.g. videoconferencing). We also varied clinician-clinician contact; baseline and ongoing ""external"" infection rates; whether overt symptoms reduced transmission risk behaviourally (e.g. via personal protective equipment, PPE); and household clustering. Results. Service organization had minimal effects on whole-population infection under our assumptions but materially affected clinician infection. Appointment type and inter-clinician contact had greater effects at low external infection rates and without a behavioural symptom response. Clustering magnified the effect of appointment type. We discuss infection control and other factors affecting appointment choice and team organization. Conclusions. Distancing between clinicians can have significant effects on team infection. Loss of clinicians to infection likely has an adverse impact on care, not modelled here. Appointments must account for clinical necessity as well as infection control. Interventions to reduce transmission risk can synergize, arguing for maximal distancing and behavioural measures (e.g. PPE) consistent with safe care.","Cardinal, R. N.; Meiser-Stedman, C.

To ease their potentially devastating socioeconomic consequences, we propose here an alternating quarantine strategy: at every instance, half of the population remains under lockdown while the other half continues to be active - maintaining a routine of weekly succession between activity and quarantine. This regime minimizes infectious interactions, as it allows only half of the population to interact for just half of the time. As a result it provides a dramatic reduction in transmission, comparable to that achieved by a population-wide lockdown, despite sustaining socioeconomic continuity at ~50% capacity. The weekly alternations also help address the specific challenge of COVID-19, as their periodicity synchronizes with the natural SARS-CoV-2 disease time-scales, allowing to effectively isolate the majority of infected individuals precisely at the time of their peak infection.","Meidan, Dror; Schulmann, Nava; Cohen, Reuven; Haber, Simcha; Yaniv, Eyal; Sarid, Ronit; Barzel, Baruch",Nat Commun,231,5

However, pregnant women with a low socio-economic status often fail to meet dietary guidelines and requirements for healthy nutrition. Dietitians may play an important role in providing nutritional advice during pregnancy because midwives often experience a lack of nutritional knowledge, time and skills to provide adequate advice. However, there is limited research on the support that dietitians can offer in antenatal care practices for pregnant women. Therefore, this study aims to explore the opportunities for dietitians to support pregnant women with a low socio-economic status in concurrent antenatal care practices in the Netherlands. METHODS: In-depth interviews were conducted with 14 pregnant women with a low socio-economic status and 13 dietitians to identify barriers for healthy eating for pregnant women and the associated opportunities for dietitians to support these women in making healthy dietary changes. RESULTS: Four opportunities for dietitians to support pregnant women in making dietary changes could be discerned: (1) creating awareness of healthy and unhealthy eating patterns, (2) providing reliable and personally relevant information, (3) help identifying barriers and solutions for healthy eating and (4) making healthy eating manageable. Dietitians indicated that supporting pregnant women with a low socio-economic status in consuming a healthy diet requires the investment of sufficient time, effort and money. CONCLUSIONS: Dietitians are trained and well-equipped to provide extensive support to pregnant women to promote a healthy dietary intake, especially when the complex interplay of barriers that pregnant women with a low socio-economic status experience for healthy eating needs to be addressed. In addition, there is a strong need for strengthening the collaboration between dietitians and midwives because midwives are the primary care provider for pregnant women in the Netherlands, but they often lack sufficient opportunities to provide adequate nutrition support. Strengthening this collaboration could promote that nutrition becomes a recurring and standard topic in antenatal care.","Super, Sabina; Beulen, Yvette H.; Koelen, Maria A.; Wagemakers, Annemarie",J Health Popul Nutr,231,11

Based on multiple heterogeneous data sources, which include aggregated mobility change reports and household survey data, this paper proposes a machine learning approach for dynamic activity chain pattern estimation with improved interpretability for examining behavioral pattern adjustments. Based on historical household survey samples, we first establish a computational graph-based discrete choice model to estimate the baseline travel tour parameters before the pandemic. To further capture structural deviations of activity chain patterns from day-by-day time series, we define the activity-oriented deviation parameters within an interpretable utility-based nested logit model framework, which are further estimated through a constrained optimization problem. By incorporating the long short-term memory method as the explainable module to capture the complex periodic and trend information before and after interventions, we predict day-to-day activity chain patterns with more accuracy. The performance of our model is examined based on publicly available datasets such as the 2017 National Household Travel Survey in the United States and the Google Global Mobility Dataset throughout the epidemic period.

The aim of this study is to explore the accuracy of transcutaneous laryngeal ultrasonography (TLUSG) in order to assess vocal fold movement. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed blindly both TLUSG and flexible fiberoptic laryngoscopy(FFL) on 38 patients, from March to June 2020. Patients were divided into two groups:the former with normally mobile vocal folds and the latter with unilateral vocal fold paralysis. RESULTS: On FFL findings, 10/38 patients (26,31%) had unilateral vocal fold paralysis; on TLUSG results, 9/38 patients (23.68%) presented impaired vocal fold motion. In comparison to laryngoscopy, the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value of TLUSG for assessment of vocal fold mobility was 80%, 96.42%, 88.88%, 93.10% respectively. A significant association between the two techniques was found on the Chi-square test: X(2) = 19.7722 (p value <0.00001). Cohen's K value showed a substantial agreement: K = 0,79. CONCLUSION: Although TLUSG could undoubtedly not replace laringoscopy, it represents a noninvasive and useful diagnostic tool for otolaryngologists especially during covid-19 pandemic.Data collected about its high sensitivity and specificity suggest that TLUSG could be a reliable method to screen vocal fold paralysis without performing aerosol-generating procedures, thus providing clear visualization of laryngeal real-time movements, even in non-compliant or high-risk infection patients. Our results allow us to consider TLUSG as part of the preoperative assessment of vocal folds in patients undergoing thyroidectomy.","Sciancalepore, Pasqua Irene; Anzivino, Roberta; Petrone, Paolo; Petrone, Domenico; Quaranta, Nicola",Am J Otolaryngol,231,1

This status requires increased levels of personal protective equipment, fallow time between cases and results in reduced operating theatre efficiency. Aerosol generation has never been quantitated during supraglottic airway use. To address this evidence gap, we conducted real-time aerosol monitoring (0.3-10-µm diameter) in ultraclean operating theatres during supraglottic airway insertion and removal. This showed very low background particle concentrations (median (IQR [range]) 1.6 (0-3.1 [0-4.0]) particles.l-1 ) against which the patient's tidal breathing produced a higher concentration of aerosol (4.0 (1.3-11.0 [0-44]) particles.l-1 , p = 0.048). The average aerosol concentration detected during supraglottic airway insertion (1.3 (1.0-4.2 [0-6.2]) particles.l-1 , n = 11), and removal (2.1 (0-17.5 [0-26.2]) particles.l-1 , n = 12) was no different to tidal breathing (p = 0.31 and p = 0.84, respectively). Comparison of supraglottic airway insertion and removal with a volitional cough (104 (66-169 [33-326]), n = 27), demonstrated that supraglottic airway insertion/removal sequences produced <4% of the aerosol compared with a single cough (p < 0.001). A transient aerosol increase was recorded during one complicated supraglottic airway insertion (which initially failed to provide a patent airway). Detailed analysis of this event showed an atypical particle size distribution and we subsequently identified multiple sources of non-respiratory aerosols that may be produced during airway management and can be considered as artefacts. These findings demonstrate supraglottic airway insertion/removal generates no more bio-aerosol than breathing and far less than a cough. This should inform the design of infection prevention strategies for anaesthetists and operating theatre staff caring for patients managed with supraglottic airways.","Shrimpton, A J; Gregson, F K A; Brown, J M; Cook, T M; Bzdek, B R; Hamilton, F; Reid, J P; Pickering, A E",Anaesthesia (Lond.),231,26

Changes in diet for the worse were associated with increases in anxiety. Exercise frequency was clearly related to state anxiety (0 days/week > 6 days/week). Those who did aerobic exercise did not have any increase in depression. Use of tele-psychotherapy predicted lower levels of depression and anxiety. In multiple regression, anxiety was predicted by the greatest number of COVID-19 specific factors. In conclusion, mental health outcomes worsened for Brazilians during the first month of quarantine and these changes are associated with a variety of risk factors.","Filgueiras, A.; Stults-Kolehmainen, M.",,231,20

Depending on the heterogeneity test, we used either random or fixed‐effect models to analyse the appropriateness of the pooled results. Overall, 540 articles included in this study; 75,164 cases of COVID‐19 (157 studies), 113,818 influenza type A (251 studies) and 9266 influenza type B patients (47 studies) were included. Runny nose, dyspnoea, sore throat and rhinorrhoea were less frequent symptoms in COVID‐19 cases (14%, 15%, 11.5% and 9.5%, respectively) in comparison to influenza type A (70%, 45.5%, 49% and 44.5%, respectively) and type B (74%, 33%, 38% and 49%, respectively). Most of the patients with COVID‐19 had abnormal chest radiology (84%, p < 0.001) in comparison to influenza type A (57%, p < 0.001) and B (33%, p < 0.001). The incubation period in COVID‐19 (6.4 days estimated) was longer than influenza type A (3.4 days). Likewise, the duration of hospitalization in COVID‐19 patients (14 days) was longer than influenza type A (6.5 days) and influenza type B (6.7 days). Case fatality rate of hospitalized patients in COVID‐19 (6.5%, p < 0.001), influenza type A (6%, p < 0.001) and influenza type B was 3%(p < 0.001). The results showed that COVID‐19 and influenza had many differences in clinical manifestations and radiographic findings. Due to the lack of effective medication or vaccine for COVID‐19, timely detection of this viral infection and distinguishing from influenza are very important.","Pormohammad, Ali; Ghorbani, Saied; Khatami, Alireza; Razizadeh, Mohammad Hossein; Alborzi, Ehsan; Zarei, Mohammad; Idrovo, Juan‐Pablo; Turner, Raymond J.",Rev Med Virol,231,16

Regional hospitals are the cornerstone of LMIC rural surgical care but have insufficient human resources and infrastructure that limit the surgical care they can provide. District hospitals are most accessible for many rural patients but also have limited surgical capacity. In order to surgical access for rural people, both regional and district hospital surgical services must be strengthened. A strong relationship between regional and district hospitals through a hub and spoke model is needed. Regional hospital surgeons can support training and supervision for and referrals from district hospitals. Telemedicine can play a key role to leapfrog physical barriers and surgical specialist shortages. The changing demographics of surgical disease will continue to worsen the strain on tertiary hospitals where most subspecialists in LMICs work. The fewer rural patients who need to travel to urban referral and tertiary facilities for problems that can be managed at lower-level facilities, the better access to timely surgical care for all.","Chu, Kathryn; Maine, Rebecca; Duvenage, Riaan",World J Surg,231,16

MATERIALS AND METHODS: EMS data for the same time interval (March 11‐April 24) in the last 3 years (2018, 2019 and 2020) were compared. RESULTS: While the number of calls increased by 90.9% during the pandemic period (from 2019 to 2020), the number of cases increased by 9.8%. Of all cases transported to hospital, 15.2% were suspected of and 2.9% were diagnosed with COVID‐19. In the pandemic period, case frequency decreased in the 0‐6 age group (−4.1%) and 7‐18 age group (‐39.9%) while the number of patients in the 19‐65 age group (12.9%) and 65+ age group (21.5%) increased. There was a statistically significant difference between pre‐pandemic and pandemic period in terms of rural area case frequency. During the pandemic period, case frequency of angina pectoris (−35.2%), myocardial infarction (−45%), acute abdomen (−23.8%) and cerebrovascular diseases (−2.9%) decreased contrary to pre‐pandemic period (2019). During the same period, symptoms of fever (+14.1%) and cough (+956.3%) increased. There was a statistically significant difference between pre‐pandemic and pandemic period in terms of forensic case frequency (P < .05). In addition, there was a statistically significant difference between these periods in terms of the frequency of patients who died at the scene.

To date, there are limited reports that describe the effect of HMPV genotypes and/or viral load on disease pathogenesis in adults. This study aims to determine the role of HMPV genetic diversity and nasopharyngeal viral load on symptom severity in outpatient adults with acute respiratory tract infections. METHODS: Severity of common cold symptoms of patients from a teaching hospital was assessed by a four-category scale and summed to obtain the total symptom severity score (TSSS). Association between the fusion and glycoprotein genes diversity, viral load (quantified using an improved RT-qPCR assay), and symptom severity were analyzed using bivariate and linear regression analyses. RESULTS: Among 81/3706 HMPV-positive patients, there were no significant differences in terms of demographics, number of days elapsed between symptom onset and clinic visit, respiratory symptoms manifestation and severity between different HMPV genotypes/sub-lineages. Surprisingly, elderly patients (≥65 years old) had lower severity of symptoms (indicated by TSSS) than young and middle age adults (p = 0.008). Nasopharyngeal viral load did not correlate with nor predict symptom severity of HMPV infection. Interestingly, at 3–5 days after symptom onset, genotype A-infected patients had higher viral load compared to genotype B (4.4 vs. 3.3 log(10) RNA copies/μl) (p = 0.003). CONCLUSIONS: Overall, HMPV genetic diversity and viral load did not impact symptom severity in adults with acute respiratory tract infections. Differences in viral load dynamics over time between genotypes may have important implications on viral transmission.

The aim was to evaluate the EG shedding in ARDS installation after flu syndrome. METHODS: This cross-sectional study included patients with flu syndrome during the influenza outbreak divided into two groups: patients with and without ARDS. Healthy subjects without flu syndrome were included in a control group. We measured EG damage biomarkers (hyaluronan, syndecan-1) and endothelial cell injury biomarker (soluble thrombomodulin) during the first medical evaluation. Histological assessment of the perimeter of the hyaline membrane and the number of neutrophils infiltrated in the alveolar septum was performed in patients who died. RESULTS: ARDS group had 30 patients (44 ± 16 years old, 57% men), the non-ARDS group had 36 patients (39 ± 17 years old, 42% men), and the control group had 35 individuals (44 ± 9 years old, 51% men). Hyaluronan levels were significantly higher in the ARDS group than the two groups [31 ng/ml (interquartile range-IQR 12–56) vs. 5 ng/ml (IQR 3–10) vs. 5 ng/ml (IQR 2–8); p < 0.0001].

We aim to identify the impact government restrictions and hospital-based infection control procedures on ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) care during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Patients meeting ST elevation criteria and undergoing primary percutaneous coronary intervention from 27 March 2020, the day initial national lockdown measures were announced in Ireland, were included in the study. Patients presenting after the lockdown period, from 18 May to 31 June 2020, were also examined. Time from symptom onset to first medical contact (FMC), transfer time and time of wire cross was noted. Additionally, patient characteristics, left ventricular ejection fraction, mortality and biochemical parameters were documented. Outcomes and characteristics were compared against a control group of patients meeting ST elevation criteria during the month of January. RESULTS: A total of 42 patients presented with STEMI during the lockdown period. A significant increase in total ischaemic time (TIT) was noted versus controls (8.81 hours (±16.4) vs 2.99 hours (±1.39), p=0.03), with increases driven largely by delays in seeking FMC (7.13 hours (±16.4) vs 1.98 hours (±1.46), p=0.049). TIT remained significantly elevated during the postlockdown period (6.1 hours (±5.3), p=0.05), however, an improvement in patient delays was seen versus the control group (3.99 hours (±4.5), p=0.06). There was no difference seen in transfer times and door to wire cross time during lockdown, however, a significant increase in transfer times was seen postlockdown versus controls (1.81 hours (±1.0) vs 1.1 hours (±0.87), p=0.004). CONCLUSION: A significant increase in TIT was seen during the lockdown period driven mainly by patient factors highlighting the significance of public health messages on public perception.

This is particularly of importance in view of the rates of failure of seroconversion and re-infection after COVID-19 infection, which could make the vaccine role and response debatable. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) have an established immune-modulatory role, but their effects as adjuvants to vaccination have not been explored to date. MAIN BODY OF THE ABSTRACT: It is increasingly recognized that PPAR agonists can upregulate the levels of anti-apoptotic factors such as MCL-1. Such effect can improve the results of vaccination by enhancing the longevity of long-lived plasma cells (LLPCs). The interaction between PPAR agonists and the immune system does not halt here, as T cell memory is also stimulated through enhanced T regulatory cells, antagonizing PD-L1 and switching the metabolism of T cells to fatty acid oxidation, which has a remarkable effect on the persistence of T memory cells. What is even of a more significant value is the effect of PPAR gamma on ensuring a profound secretion of antibodies upon re-exposure to the offending antigen through upregulating lipoxin B4, therefore potentially assisting the vaccine response and deterring re-infection. SHORT CONCLUSION: In view of the above, we suggest the use of PPAR as adjuvants to vaccines in general especially the emerging COVID-19 vaccine due to their role in enhancing immunologic memory through DNA-dependent mechanisms.","AbdelMassih, Antoine Fakhry; Menshawey, Rahma; Ismail, Jumana H.; Husseiny, Reem J.; Husseiny, Yousef M.; Yacoub, Shenoda; Kamel, Aya; Hozaien, Rafeef; Yacoub, Elaria; Menshawey, Esraa; Abdelmalek, Abanoub; Abouelazaem, Ahmed; Elhatw, Ahmed; Aboelmaaty, Ahmed; Shahib, Alaaelrahman; Mansour, Amany; Kamal, Aya; Mohamed, Basant; Atif, Bemen; Ghabreal, Beshoy; Abdelmalak, Catherine; Ibrahim, David; Elsaify, Ebtesam; Magdy, Farah; Hanna, Farid G.; Hafez, Hadeer; Dahir, Hafsa; Merhom, Kerlos; Ahmed, Maram; Bishara, Mariam; Tawfik, Mina; Youssef, Mina; El Sharnouby, Mohamed; Hamouda, Mourad; Ammar, Musheera; Ali, Nada; Daniel, Nada; El-Husseiny, Nadine; Abdelraouf, Noha; Abdelhameed, Nuran K.; Ahmed, Radwa; Othman, Radwa; Mohamadein, Rahma; Allam, Rana; Elgendy, Rana; Shebl, Rana; Elsherbiney, Saged; Fouad, Sarah; Emel, Sara; Owais, Sara; Hetta, Sarah; El-Saman, Samah; Abdelalim, Shaimaa; Galal, Sherin; Asar, Yara; Osman, Yara; Khalaf, Yasmeen; Aziz, Youstina; Khafagy, Yousra; Gamal, Nervana; Castaldi, Biagio",J Genet Eng Biotechnol,231,28

These viral proteins, collectively named viroporins, are crucial for viral pathogenicity. In the past five years, structures obtained by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), X-ray crystallography, and electron microscopy (EM) showed that viroporins often adopt minimalist architectures to achieve their functions. A number of small molecules have been identified to interfere with their channel activities and thereby inhibit viral infection, making viroporins potential drug targets for therapeutic intervention. The known architectures and inhibition mechanisms of viroporins differ significantly from each other, but some common principles are shared between them. This review article summarizes the recent developments in the structural investigation of viroporins and their inhibition by antiviral compounds.

Recently, the use of a single networks for capturing all the aspects of some complex scenarios has shown some limitations. Consequently, it has been proposed to use Dual Networks (DN), a pair of related networks, to analyse complex systems. The two graphs in a DN have the same set of vertices and different edge sets. Common subgraphs among these networks may convey some insights about the modelled scenarios. For instance, the detection of the Top-k Densest Connected subgraphs, i.e. a set k subgraphs having the largest density in the conceptual network which are also connected in the physical network, may reveal set of highly related nodes. After proposing a formalisation of the approach, we propose a heuristic to find a solution, since the problem is computationally hard.

METHODS: We extracted publicly available data from various official websites, summarized the strategies implemented in these four countries, and assessed the effectiveness of the prevention and control measures adopted by these countries. RESULTS: As of October 28, 2020, the growth of daily new confirmed cases has stabilized in China, Singapore, and South Korea. In Japan, the daily new confirmed cases increased sharply since it lifted a state of emergency, but case-fatality maintains at a lower level. The growth of total cases is near stagnant in China and Singapore, with a case-fatality of 5.39 and 0.05% respectively. The case-fatality rate between Japan and South Korea is identical at 1.76%, however, Japan’s growth rate of cases has increased more rapidly than South Korea. CONCLUSION: This study found that China, Japan, Singapore, and South Korea accessed the situation within their own borders and implemented different intervention strategies to curb the spread of COVID-19 and maintain lower rates of case-fatality. China, Singapore, and South Korea adopted the containment strategy, while Japan adopted the mitigation strategy. Although Japan’s case-fatality maintained at a low level, daily new cases increased faster than the other three countries. This result indicated that a mitigation strategy could be inferior to a containment strategy.","Chen, Haiqian; Shi, Leiyu; Zhang, Yuyao; Wang, Xiaohan; Sun, Gang",Global Health,231,26

Because wearing a mask mixes expired air with the subject's inspired air stream, the concentration of inspired carbon dioxide [CO2] is elevated, resulting in mild hypercapnia. Changes in the inspired gas mixture have been demonstrated to alter R2*-weighted Blood Oxygen Dependent (BOLD) contrast. In this study, we investigate a potential for face masking to alter BOLD contrast during a sensory-motor task designed to activate visual, auditory, and sensorimotor cortices in 8 subjects. We utilize a nasal cannula to supply air to the subject wearing a surgical mask in on-off blocks of 90s to displace expired CO2, while the subject performs the sensory-motor task. While only a small fraction (2.5%) of the sensory-motor task activation is related to nasal air modulation, a 30.0% change in gray matter BOLD signal baseline is found due to air modulation. Repeating the scan with mask removed produces a small subject-specific bias in BOLD baseline signal from nasal air supply, which may be due to cognitive influence of airflow or cannula-induced hypoxia. Measurements with capnography demonstrate wearing a mask induces an average increase in ETCO2 of 7.4%. Altogether, these results demonstrate that wearing a face mask during gradient-echo fMRI can alter BOLD baseline signal but minimally affects task activation.","Law, Christine S.W.; Lan, Patricia S.; Glover, Gary H.",Neuroimage,231,24

This study proposes a hybrid multiple attribute decision-making (MADM) model that determines practical competency of the newly graduated nurse as an evaluation framework. A causal influence-network diagram (CIND) and influential weights are obtained from nursing experts' clinical experience using the decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory (DEMATEL)-based analytical network process analysis (DANP). The MOORA-AS method is then used to evaluate the ability expectation ratio-gap for newly graduated nurses in practice. The CIND is used to allow each newly graduated nurse to reduce the performance ratio-gaps between the current level and the aspirational level from a systematic perspective. The empirical data applies to a third-class and a first-class hospital in China. The results show that the proposed hybrid MADM model has reliable results and allows nursing department decision-makers/managers to easily evaluate and systematically improve competencies for newly graduated nurses.,"Cheng, Fengmin; Jin, Yanjun; Chien, Ching-Wen; Xiong, Lei; Chuang, Yen-Ching",J Healthc Eng,231,3

Using survey data for respondents from 10 states merged with state-level data, our study represents a pioneering effort to reveal contextual and individual social capital factors that explain public mask wearing in response to COVID–19. Findings of logistic multilevel regression show that the COVID–19 death rate and political control of government at the state level along with one's social capital at the individual level altogether influence whether people decide to wear face masks. These findings contribute to the rapidly growing literature and have policy implications for mitigating the pandemic's devastating impact on the American public.","Hao, Feng; Shao, Wanyun; Huang, Weiwei",Health Place,231,16

This article analyzes 32 national health sector policies, strategies, and plans across 10 different areas of health equity to understand, from one perspective, how equity is being addressed in the region. It finds significant variation in the substance and structure of how the health plans handle the issue. Nearly all countries explicitly include health equity as a clear goal, and most address the social determinants of health. Participatory processes documented in the development of these plans range from none to extensive and robust. Substantive equity-focused policies, such as those to improve physical accessibility of health care and increase affordable access to medicines, are included in many plans, though no country includes all aspects examined. Countries identify marginalized populations in their plans, though only a quarter specifically identify Afro-descendants and more than half do not address Indigenous people, including countries with large Indigenous populations. Four include attention to migrants. Despite health equity goals and data on baseline inequities, fewer than half of countries include time-bound targets on reducing absolute or relative health inequalities. Clear accountability mechanisms such as education, reporting, or rights-enforcement mechanisms in plans are rare. The nearly unanimous commitment across countries of the Americas to equity in health provides an important opportunity. Learning from the most robust equity-focused plans could provide a road map for efforts to translate broad goals into time-bound targets and eventually to increasing equity.","Kavanagh, Matthew M.; Norato, Laura Fernanda; Friedman, Eric A.; Armbrister, Adria N.",Rev Panam Salud Publica,231,26

While negative health, economic, and social consequences are being extensively studied, there has been less research on the resilience and post-traumatic growth that people show in the face of adversity. We investigated New Zealanders’ experiences of benefit-finding during the COVID-19 pandemic and analysed qualitative responses to a survey examining mental well-being during the New Zealand lockdown. A total of 1175 of 2010 eligible participants responded to an open-ended question probing ‘silver linings’ (i.e., positive aspects) they may have experienced during this period. We analysed these qualitative responses using a thematic analysis approach. Two thirds of participants identified silver linings from the lockdown and we developed two overarching themes: Surviving (coping well, meeting basic needs, and maintaining health) and thriving (self-development, reflection, and growth). Assessing positive as well as negative consequences of the pandemic provides more nuanced insights into the impact that New Zealand’s response had on mental well-being.","Jenkins, Matthew; Hoek, Janet; Jenkin, Gabrielle; Gendall, Philip; Stanley, James; Beaglehole, Ben; Bell, Caroline; Rapsey, Charlene; Every-Palmer, Susanna",PLoS One,231,26

Method: Five healthy male and five healthy female participants performed intermittent exercise on a treadmill while wearing the protective facemasks in a climate chamber controlled at an air temperature of 25°C and a relative humidity of 70%. Four types of facemasks, including N95 (3M 8210) and surgical facemasks, which were treated with nano-functional materials, were used in the study. Results: (1) The subjects had significantly lower average heart rates when wearing nano-treated and untreated surgical facemasks than when wearing nano-treated and untreated N95 facemasks. (2) The outer surface temperature of both surgical facemasks was significantly higher than that of both N95 facemasks. On the other hand, the microclimate and skin temperatures inside the facemask were significantly lower than those in both N95 facemasks. (3) Both surgical facemasks had significantly higher absolute humidity outside the surface than both N95 facemasks. The absolute humidity inside the surgical facemask was significantly lower than that inside both N95 facemasks. (4) Both surgical facemasks were rated significantly lower for perception of humidity, heat, breath resistance and overall discomfort than both N95 facemasks. The ratings for other sensations, including feeling unfit, tight, itchy, fatigued, odorous and salty, that were obtained while the subjects were wearing the surgical facemasks were significantly lower than when the subjects were wearing the N95 facemasks. (5) Subjective preference for the nano-treated surgical facemasks was the highest. There was significant differences in preference between the nano-treated and untreated surgical facemasks and between the surgical and N95 facemasks. Discussion: We discuss how N95 and surgical facemasks induce significantly different temperature and humidity in the microclimates of the facemasks, which have profound influences on heart rate and thermal stress and subjective perception of discomfort.","Li, Y.; Tokura, H.; Guo, Y.P.; Wong, A.S.W.; Wong, T.; Chung, J.; Newton, E.",Int Arch Occup Environ Health,231,14

METHODS: We undertook a cross-sectional study to evaluate the microbial composition, cytokine levels and pneumococcal carriage densities in samples from children presenting with an influenza-like illness (ILI) and asymptomatic healthy controls (HC). RESULTS: The proportion of children harbouring viral organisms (Relative risk (RR) 1.4, p=0.0222) or ≥4 microbes at a time (RR 1.9, p<0.0001), was higher in ILI patients than HC. ILI patients had higher IL-8 levels in nasal aspirates than HC (median [IQR], 265.7 [0 – 452.3] vs. 0 [0 – 127.3] pg/ml; p = 0.0154). Having an ILI was associated with higher pneumococcal carriage densities compared to HC (RR 4.2, p<0.0001). CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that children with an ILI have an increased propensity for high pneumococcal carriage density.

Both the pandemic and these measures have the potential to cause mental health problems among individuals. OBJECTIVE: The present study aimed to investigate and estimate the prevalence of psychological well-being, particularly from an Indian perspective using systematic review and meta-analysis of existing literature. METHODS: We searched in the PubMed database, starting from the onset of the current pandemic and until 10th October 2020 to synthesize evidence on mental health outcomes from India. DerSimonian and Laird method of the random-effects meta-analysis was employed and heterogeneity between studies was assessed using the Chi-square based Cochran's Q statistic and I-squared (I(2)) statistics. RESULTS: The pooled prevalence of stress in nine studies was 60.7% (95% CI: 42.3%–77.7%), depression in eight studies was 32.7% (95% CI: 24.6%–41.3%), anxiety in six studies was 34.1% (95% CI: 26.3%–42.3%) and sleep disturbances in six studies was 26.7% (95% CI: 13.9%–41.8%). As expected, high heterogeneity was observed in the above-mentioned outcomes. Sub-group analysis showed that Health Care Workers (HCWs) had a higher prevalence of stress, anxiety, depression & psychological distress in comparison to the general population. CONCLUSION: A significant impact on psychological well-being during COVID-19 was observed in India as common adverse outcomes were stress (61%), psychological distress (43%), anxiety (34%), depression (33%), and sleep disturbances (27%).

This review aims to describe the pattern of influenza B occurrence in Brazil to have a better understanding of its epidemiology and its relevance when considering seasonal influenza vaccine composition. A review of the data including analysis of international and local surveillance data as well as information from online search of databases using Medical Subject Headings terms in conjunction with screening of abstracts from scientific events was performed. Based on international epidemiologic surveillance data, moderate levels of influenza B disease (19%; 2006–2014) were observed. Of these nine years, it was possible to compare data from three years (2007, 2008 and 2013) which have information on the circulating influenza B lineage. Co-circulation of influenza B lineages was observed in all these three influenza seasons, of which, during one season, a high degree of mismatch between the vaccine lineage and the predominant circulating lineage (91.4% [2013]) was observed. Local surveillance data reveal a distinct and dynamic distribution of respiratory viruses over the years. Data from published literature and abstracts show that influenza B is a significant cause of disease with an unpredictable circulation pattern and showing trends indicating reemergence of the B/Victoria lineage. The abstracts report notable levels of co-circulation of both influenza B lineages (2000–2013). Mismatch between the Southern hemisphere vaccine and the most prevalent circulating viruses in Brazil were observed in five influenza seasons. The evidence on co-circulation of two influenza B lineages and mismatched seasons in Brazil indicates the benefit of quadrivalent influenza vaccines in conferring broader seasonal influenza protection. Additionally, improving influenza surveillance platforms in Brazil is important for monitoring disease trends and the impact of introducing seasonal influenza vaccination.","Barros, Eliana Nogueira Castro de; Cintra, Otavio; Rossetto, Erika; Freitas, Laís; Colindres, Romulo",Braz J Infect Dis,231,16

INTRODUCTION: Decompensation of heart failure leading (HF) to hospitalisation is the single most important drain on healthcare resources when managing patients with left ventricular systolic dysfunction. Cardiac resynchronisation therapy with/without defibrillators (CRT-P/D) decreases hospitalisation due to HF and improves survival while implantable cardiac defibrillators (ICD""s) have a favourable effect on the former. Proprietary software algorithms embedded in these complex devices give an early warning to clinicians when decompensation of HF is imminent allowing preventative action to be undertaken. HeartLogic (HL) is one such new algorithm in Boston Scientific CRT-D/ICD devices using multiple sensors to track 5 physiological parameters, combining them into one composite Index, with an Alert being triggered if the Index is >16. The COVID-19 pandemic, due to multiple reasons, resulted in a significant decrease in availability of routine HF services in the United Kingdom, especially during the initial lockdown period from 23rd March to 1st July 2020. AIM: To assess the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, using HL, in patients with HF and complex devices. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Retrospective analysis of patients in a tertiary care cardiac centre in whom the HL software had been activated in March/April 2019 (n = 49) and comparison of those with (Group A n = 21) and without (Group B n = 28) an Alert (HLA) during the COVID-19 pandemic. Results (Table): Whole cohort n = 49. Age: 72 ± 12 years, Median: 75, Range: 36-95. 36/49 (73.5%) males. Type of device implanted: Resonate X4 CRT-D: 28/49 (57.1%); Momentum CRT-D: 8/49 (16.3%); Resonate ICD: 13/49 (26.5%). Ischaemic aetiology of HF: 35/49 (71.4%), Total duration of HL monitoring: 632 ± 7 days (median: 632; range: 626-672). There was no difference in the age, gender, and type of device implanted between Group A and Group B. Over nearly ∼1 year of monitoring in each of the groups, Group A had more unstable HF with 10/21 (47.6%) having their first HLA during the pandemic. Multiple HLA""s, longer period in HLA and those with ischaemic aetiology of HF were higher in Group A. 17/40 (42.5%) HLA""s in Group A were within the first lockdown period (March - July). 24/28 (85.7%) patients in Group B had no HLA""s either before or during the pandemic. There was no difference in the HLA score between Groups A and B. CONCLUSION: In this limited group of patients with a medium term follow-up, using the HeartLogic software, patients with ischaemic aetiology of HF and those with more HLA""s prior to the pandemic did worse than those who no HLA""s. First HLA""s, multiple alerts and longer duration of alerts in this group of patients suggests a lack of access to adequate HF services during the pandemic. It has implications with regard to how HF services are configured in future whenever resources are constrained.","Jinadu, T; Dowd, R; Bradley, L; Painter, E; Hughes, S; Ahmad, S; Khan, N; Khanra, D; Arya, A; Selvakumar, V; Spencer, C; Petkar, S",Europace,231,1

However, few studies have assessed the latent dimensionality of the DSM-XC or provided guidance on how to score the survey. In this report, we examined the factor structure of the DSM-XC in a sample of over 3500 participants enrolled in a protocol on the mental health impact of COVID-19 conducted through the National Institute of Mental Health Intramural Research Program (NIMH IRP) (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT04339790).

We found a six-factor solution stemming from our EFAs to best fit our data. Each factor captures symptoms related to a specific construct of psychopathology: mood, worry, activation, somatic, confusion, and substance use. Future research should evaluate this six-factor structure using additional datasets to confirm its consistency across research populations and settings.","Gibbons, A.; Farmer, C.; Shaw, J.

The present cross-sectional study was intended to understand the perturbation in the nasopharyngeal microbiome composition within the infected (n=63) and non-infected (n=26) individuals using 16S rRNA gene based targeted amplicon sequencing and their association with host types and the prevalence of opportunistic pathogens at the stage of infection. The results confirmed that number of OTUs were significantly (p < 0.05) decreased in the SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals in comparison to non-infected individuals. Pairwise Wilcoxon test showed a significant (p<0.05) increase in the abundance of Proteobacteria in infected individuals compared to non-infected ones and vice-versa for Fusobacteria and Bacteroidetes.

Provision of support for these challenges is complicated by the high number of people requiring support and the need to maintain physical distancing. Text4Hope, a daily supportive SMS text messaging program, was launched in Canada to mitigate the negative mental health impacts of the pandemic among Canadians. OBJECTIVE: This paper describes the changes in the stress, anxiety, and depression levels of subscribers to the Text4Hope program after 6 weeks of exposure to daily supportive SMS text messages. METHODS: We used self-administered, empirically supported web-based questionnaires to assess the demographic and clinical characteristics of Text4Hope subscribers. Perceived stress, anxiety, and depression were measured with the 10-Item Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-10), the Generalized Anxiety Disorder–7 (GAD-7) scale, and the Patient Health Questionnaire–9 (PHQ-9) scale at baseline and sixth week time points. Moderate or high perceived stress, likely generalized anxiety disorder, and likely major depressive disorder were assessed using cutoff scores of ≥14 for the PSS-10, ≥10 for the GAD-7, and ≥10 for the PHQ-9, respectively. At 6 weeks into the program, 766 participants had completed the questionnaires at both time points. RESULTS: At the 6-week time point, there were statistically significant reductions in mean scores on the PSS-10 and GAD-7 scales but not on the PHQ-9 scale. Effect sizes were small overall. There were statistically significant reductions in the prevalence rates of moderate or high stress and likely generalized anxiety disorder but not likely major depressive disorder for the group that completed both the baseline and 6-week assessments. The largest reductions in mean scores and prevalence rates were for anxiety (18.7% and 13.5%, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Text4Hope is a convenient, cost-effective, and accessible means of implementing a population-level psychological intervention. This service demonstrated significant reductions in anxiety and stress levels during the COVID-19 pandemic and could be used as a population-level mental health intervention during natural disasters and other emergencies.

SETTING: The survey was conducted among 110 villages and urban wards across 10 districts in Kashmir from 17 October 2020 to 4 November 2020. PARTICIPANTS: Individuals aged 18 years and above were eligible to be included in the survey. Serum samples were tested for the presence of SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG antibodies using the Abbott SARS-CoV-2 IgG assay. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: We labelled assay results equal to or above the cut-off index value of 1.4 as positive for SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG antibodies. Seroprevalence estimates were adjusted for the sampling design and assay characteristics. RESULTS: Out of 6397 eligible individuals enumerated, 6315 (98.7%) agreed to participate. The final analysis was done on 6230 participants. Seroprevalence adjusted for the sampling design and assay characteristics was 36.7% (95% CI 34.3% to 39.2%). Seroprevalence was higher among the older population. Among seropositive individuals, 10.2% (247/2415) reported a history of COVID-19-like symptoms. Out of 474 symptomatic individuals, 233 (49.2%) reported having been tested. We estimated an infection fatality rate of 0.034%. CONCLUSIONS: During the first 7 months of the COVID-19 epidemic in Kashmir Valley, approximately 37% of individuals were infected. The reported number of COVID-19 cases was only a small fraction of the estimated number of infections. A more efficient surveillance system with strengthened reporting of COVID-19 cases and deaths is warranted.","Khan, S Muhammad Salim; Qurieshi, Mariya Amin; Haq, Inaamul; Majid, Sabhiya; Ahmad, Javid; Ayub, Taha; Bhat, Ashfaq Ahmad; Fazili, Anjum Bashir; Ganai, Abdul Majeed; Jan, Yasmeen; Kaul, Rauf-ur-Rashid; Khan, Zahid Ali; Masoodi, Muneer Ahmad; Mushtaq, Beenish; Nazir, Fouzia; Nazir, Muzamil; Raja, Malik Waseem; Rasool, Mahbooba; Asma, Anjum; Ayoub, Shifana; Aziz, Munazza; Bhat, Arif Akbar; Chowdri, Iqra Nisar; Ismail, Shaista; Kawoosa, Misbah Ferooz; Khan, Mehvish Afzal; Khan, Mosin Saleem; Kousar, Rafiya; Lone, Ab Aziz; Nabi, Shahroz; Obaid, Mohammad; Qazi, Tanzeela Bashir; Sabah, Iram; Sumji, Ishtiyaq Ahmad",BMJ Open,231,1
