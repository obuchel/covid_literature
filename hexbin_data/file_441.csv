3509,3509,3509,Association of Candidate Genes with Response to Heat and Newcastle Disease Virus,10.839955,7.0232244,2018-11-19,"Newcastle disease is considered the number one disease constraint to poultry production in low and middle-income countries, however poultry that is raised in resource-poor areas often experience multiple environmental challenges. Heat stress has a negative impact on production, and immune response to pathogens can be negatively modulated by heat stress. Candidate genes and regions chosen for this study were based on previously reported associations with response to immune stimulants, pathogens, or heat, including: TLR3, TLR7, MX, MHC-B (major histocompatibility complex, gene complex), IFI27L2, SLC5A1, HSPB1, HSPA2, HSPA8, IFRD1, IL18R1, IL1R1, AP2A2, and TOLLIP. Chickens of a commercial egg-laying line were infected with a lentogenic strain of NDV (Newcastle disease virus); half the birds were maintained at thermoneutral temperature and the other half were exposed to high ambient temperature before the NDV challenge and throughout the remainder of the study. Phenotypic responses to heat, to NDV, or to heat + NDV were measured. Selected SNPs (single nucleotide polymorphisms) within 14 target genes or regions were genotyped; and genotype effects on phenotypic responses to NDV or heat + NDV were tested in each individual treatment group and the combined groups. Seventeen significant haplotype effects, among seven genes and seven phenotypes, were detected for response to NDV or heat or NDV + heat. These findings identify specific genetic variants that are associated with response to heat and/or NDV which may be useful in the genetic improvement of chickens to perform favorably when faced with pathogens and heat stress.","Rowland, Kaylee; Saelao, Perot; Wang, Ying; Fulton, Janet E.; Liebe, Grant N.; McCarron, Amy M.; Wolc, Anna; Gallardo, Rodrigo A.; Kelly, Terra; Zhou, Huaijun; Dekkers, Jack C.

4340,4340,4340,Description of the Risk Management of Medication Errors for Centrally Authorised Products in the European Union,10.57779,3.758075,2019-10-16,"INTRODUCTION: Medication errors can have serious consequences for patients. To prevent the occurrence of medication errors in clinical practice, safety concerns may be included in the risk management plan and subsequently be addressed with routine and/or additional risk minimisation measures. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to describe safety concerns around medication errors and the risk minimisation measures for centrally authorised products in the European Union. METHODS: All safety concerns included in the risk management plans of originator centrally authorised products, authorised between 1 January, 2010 and 31 December, 2017, were collected from the European Public Assessment Report registry. Medication error safety concerns were categorised by Anatomical Therapeutic Classification code, year of authorisation, type of medication error and type of risk minimisation measure. RESULTS: During the study period, 311 centrally authorised products were approved, of which 84 had at least one medication error safety concern. The proportion of centrally authorised products with medication error safety concerns showed variation between 2010 and 2017 ranging from 15.2% to 36.4%. In total, 95 medication error safety concerns were identified. The type of medication error was highly variable, drug administration error was listed most frequently (n = 17). For 27 out of 95 medication error safety concerns, corresponding to 23 centrally authorised products, additional risk minimisation measures were required. All additional risk minimisation measures consisted of educational material targeted at healthcare professionals (85.2%) and/or patients (51.9%). For 78.3% of centrally authorised products with additional risk minimisation measures for medication errors, studies to evaluate the effectiveness of the additional risk minimisation measures were agreed upon. CONCLUSIONS: Medication error safety concerns were listed for almost a quarter of centrally authorised products approved during the study period. Further research is needed to evaluate the effectiveness and continued need for additional risk minimisation measures for medication errors.

Therefore, deciphering the mechanisms of how autophagy supports tumor cell metabolism is essential. Here, we demonstrate that the inhibition of autophagy induces an accumulation of lipid droplets (LD) due to a decrease in fatty acid β-oxidation, that leads to a reduction of oxidative phosphorylation (OxPHOS) in acute myeloid leukemia (AML), but not in normal cells. Thus, the autophagic process participates in lipid catabolism that supports OxPHOS in AML cells. Interestingly, the inhibition of OxPHOS leads to LD accumulation with the concomitant inhibition of autophagy. Mechanistically, we show that the disruption of mitochondria–endoplasmic reticulum (ER) contact sites (MERCs) phenocopies OxPHOS inhibition. Altogether, our data establish that mitochondria, through the regulation of MERCs, controls autophagy that, in turn finely tunes lipid degradation to fuel OxPHOS supporting proliferation and growth in leukemia.","Bosc, Claudie; Broin, Nicolas; Fanjul, Marjorie; Saland, Estelle; Farge, Thomas; Courdy, Charly; Batut, Aurélie; Masoud, Rawand; Larrue, Clément; Skuli, Sarah; Espagnolle, Nicolas; Pagès, Jean-Christophe; Carrier, Alice; Bost, Frédéric; Bertrand-Michel, Justine; Tamburini, Jérôme; Récher, Christian; Bertoli, Sarah; Mansat-De Mas, Véronique; Manenti, Stéphane; Sarry, Jean-Emmanuel; Joffre, Carine",Nat Commun,441,1

However, established techniques like polymerase chain reaction (PCR) are time-consuming laboratory-bound techniques while rapid tests such as Lateral Flow Immunochromatographic tests often lack the required sensitivity and/or specificity. METHODS/PRINCIPLE FINDINGS: Here we present an affordable, highly mobile alternative method for the rapid identification of infectious agents using pulse-controlled amplification (PCA). PCA is a next generation nucleic acid amplification technology that uses rapid energy pulses to heat microcyclers (micro-scale metal heating elements embedded directly in the amplification reaction) for a few microseconds, thus only heating a small fraction of the reaction volume. The heated microcyclers cool off nearly instantaneously, resulting in ultra-fast heating and cooling cycles during which classic amplification of a target sequence takes place. This reduces the overall amplification time by a factor of up to 10, enabling a sample-to-result workflow in just 15 minutes, while running on a small and portable prototype device. In this proof of principle study, we designed a PCA-assay for the detection of Yersinia pestis to demonstrate the efficacy of this technology. The observed detection limits were 434 copies per reaction (purified DNA) and 35 cells per reaction (crude sample) respectively of Yersinia pestis. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: PCA offers fast and decentralized molecular diagnostics and is applicable whenever rapid, on-site detection of infectious agents is needed, even under resource limited conditions. It combines the sensitivity and specificity of PCR with the rapidness and simplicity of hitherto existing rapid tests.","Müller, Katharina; Daßen, Sarah; Holowachuk, Scott; Zwirglmaier, Katrin; Stehr, Joachim; Buersgens, Federico; Ullerich, Lars; Stoecker, Kilian",PLoS Negl Trop Dis,441,31

As of December 12, 2020 (week 50), the 2020-2021 influenza season had not begun. Only 47 laboratory-confirmed influenza detections were reported from August 23 to December 12, 2020; an unprecedentedly low number, despite higher than usual levels of influenza testing. Of this small number of detections, 64% were influenza A and 36% were influenza B. Influenza activity in Canada was at historically low levels compared with the previous five seasons. Provinces and territories reported no influenza-associated adult hospitalizations. Fewer than five hospitalizations were reported by the paediatric sentinel hospitalization network. With little influenza circulating, the National Microbiology Laboratory had not yet received samples of influenza viruses collected during the 2020-2021 season for strain characterization or antiviral resistance testing. The assessment of influenza vaccine effectiveness, typically available in mid-March, is expected to be similarly limited if low seasonal influenza circulation persists. Nevertheless, Canada's influenza surveillance system remains robust and has pivoted its syndromic, virologic and severe outcomes system components to support coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) surveillance. Despite the COVID-19 pandemic, the threat of influenza epidemics and pandemics persists. It is imperative 1) to maintain surveillance of influenza, 2) to remain alert to unusual or unexpected events and 3) to be prepared to mitigate influenza epidemics when they resurge.","Lee, Liza; Butt, Kelly; Buckrell, Steven; Nwosu, Andrea; Sevenhuysen, Claire; Bancej, Christina",Canada communicable disease report = Releve des maladies transmissibles au Canada,441,1

Commentators have drawn attention to changes in public policies and legislation that follow this shift. However, due attention has not been paid to changes in the professional standards regulating medical practice and their subsequent consequences for reproductive rights. Against this backdrop, this article examines two recent resolutions enacted by Brazilian medical boards, which violate ethical duties and the law. The first imposes a duty for doctors to disclose confidential medical information about their patients in sexual abuse cases. The second one determines that a pregnant woman's right to refuse medical treatment should be evaluated considering the fetus. This article argues that conservative setbacks operate not only through visible means, such as enacted legislation, but also furtively - through professional medical resolutions. It also asserts that, in such a context, the debate about women's bodily autonomy shifts once again from the human rights ground to the medical field, where it has traditionally been subjected to control and coercion. Finally, it points out the risk that these rules might be used to legitimize new conservative laws and public policies.","Cesario Alvim Gomes, Juliana; Helena Figueira Mendes, Corina",International journal of gynaecology and obstetrics: the official organ of the International Federation of Gynaecology and Obstetrics,441,1

The lack of protective vaccine or treatment led most of the countries to follow the flattening of the infection curve with social isolation measures. There is evidence that socioeconomic inequalities have been shaping the COVID-19 burden among low and middle-income countries. This study described what sociodemographic and socioeconomic factors were associated with the greatest risk of COVID-19 infection and mortality and how did the importance of key neighbourhood-level socioeconomic factors change over time during the early stages of the pandemic in the Rio de Janeiro municipality, Brazil. METHODS We linked socioeconomic attributes to confirmed cases and deaths from COVID-19 and computed age-standardised incidence and mortality rates by domains such as age, gender, crowding, education, income and race/ethnicity. RESULTS The evidence suggests that although age-standardised incidence rates were higher in wealthy neighbourhoods, age-standardised mortality rates were higher in deprived areas during the first 2 months of the pandemic. The age-standardised mortality rates were also higher in males, and in areas with a predominance of people of colour, which are disproportionately represented in more vulnerable groups. The population also presented COVID-19 'rejuvenation', that is, people became risk group younger than in developed countries. CONCLUSION We conclude that there is a strong health gradient for COVID-19 death risk during the early stages of the pandemic. COVID-19 cases continued to move towards the urban periphery and to more vulnerable communities, threatening the health system functioning and increasing the health gradient.","Silva, Julio; Ribeiro-Alves, Marcelo",Journal of epidemiology and community health,441,6

In QSAR, it is hypothesized that, for new chemical contaminants, their potential acute or chronic toxicity may be reasonably estimated on the basis of structural relationships to other known toxic contaminants. Thus the parallel that is being attempted for pathogenic microorganisms is that known virulence factors may be used as predictors for identifying undiscovered pathogens and microbial causes of emerging diseases. Advances in molecular biology, genomics and proteomics have led the Committee on Drinking Water Contaminants of the National Research Council, as requested by the EPA, to recommend the VFAR approach as a potentially more systematic and scientific process for the selection of microorganisms for inclusion in the Contaminant Candidate List (CCL).","De Leon, Ricardo",Journal of water and health,441,1

METHODS All SLC home ventilators commercially available in Italy can be used in a V(TG) mode with an intentional leak (""vented"") or a true expiratory valve (""non-vented"") configuration were selected. Using an experimental model consisting of a mannequin connected to an active lung simulator, for each level of leak (15, 25 and 37 l/min) three different conditions of respiratory mechanics (normal, restrictive and obstructive) were simulated using the ventilators in either a ""vented"" or ""non-vented"" configuration. RESULTS Three home ventilators were tested: Vivo50 (Breas), PB560 (Covidien) and Ventilogic LS (Weimann). In a ""vented"" circuit configuration all three ventilators kept constant or increased inspiratory pressure in all leak conditions to guarantee the V(TG). Conversely, in a ""non-vented"" circuit configuration, all tested ventilators showed a drop in inspiratory pressure in all leak conditions, resulting in a concomitant reduction in delivered tidal volume. The same behaviour was found in all conditions of respiratory mechanics. In the absence of leaks, all the ventilators, independently of circuit configuration, were able to maintain the set V(TG) in the presence of modifications of the respiratory mechanics. CONCLUSIONS The ability of the V(TG) mode to compensate for non-intentional leaks depends strictly on whether a ""vented"" or ""non-vented"" circuit configuration is used. This difference must be taken into account as a possible risk when a V(TG) mode is used in the presence of non-intentional leaks.","Carlucci, Annalisa; Schreiber, Annia; Mattei, Alessio; Malovini, Alberto; Bellinati, Jacopo; Ceriana, Piero; Gregoretti, Cesare",Intensive care medicine,441,1

Using smartphones to capture real-time symptoms and behaviours related to mental illnesses, digital phenotyping offers a practical tool to help colleges remotely monitor and assess mental health and provide more customised and responsive care. This narrative review of 25 digital phenotyping studies with college students explored how this method has been deployed, studied and has impacted mental health outcomes. We found the average duration of studies to be 42 days and the average enrolled to be 81 participants. The most common sensor-based streams collected included location, accelerometer and social information and these were used to inform behaviours such as sleep, exercise and social interactions. 52% of the studies included also collected smartphone survey in some form and these were used to assess mood, anxiety and stress among many other outcomes. The collective focus on data that construct features related to sleep, activity and social interactions indicate that this field is already appropriately attentive to the primary drivers of mental health problems among college students. While the heterogeneity of the methods of these studies presents no reliable target for mobile devices to offer automated help-the feasibility across studies suggests the potential to use these data today towards personalising care. As more unified digital phenotyping research evolves and scales to larger sample sizes, student mental health centres may consider integrating these data into their clinical practice for college students.","Melcher, Jennifer; Hays, Ryan; Torous, John",Evidence-based mental health,441,1

Our objectives were to define HMPV epidemiology and circulating strains and determine markers of severe disease in Jordanian children. METHODS We conducted a prospective study from March 16, 2010 to March 31, 2013 using quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction to determine the frequency of HMPV infection among children <2 years old admitted with fever and/or acute respiratory illness to a major government hospital in Amman, Jordan. RESULTS HMPV was present in 273 of 3168 (8.6%) of children presenting with acute respiratory tract infection. HMPV A2, B1 and B2, but not A1, were detected during the 3-year period. HMPV-infected children were older and more likely to be diagnosed with bronchopneumonia than HMPV-negative children. HMPV-infected children with lower respiratory tract infection had higher rates of cough and shortness of breath than children with lower respiratory tract infection infected with other or no identifiable viruses. Symptoms and severity were not different between children with HMPV only compared with HMPV coinfection. Children with HMPV subgroup A infection were more likely to require supplemental oxygen. In a multivariate analysis, HMPV subgroup A and age <6 months were independently associated with supplemental oxygen requirement. CONCLUSIONS HMPV is a leading cause of acute respiratory tract disease in Jordanian children <2 years old. HMPV A and young age were associated with severe disease. Ninety percent of HMPV-infected hospitalized children were full term and otherwise healthy, in contrast to high-income nations; thus, factors contributing to disease severity likely vary depending on geographic and resource differences.","Schuster, Jennifer E; Khuri-Bulos, Najwa; Faouri, Samir; Shehabi, Asem; Johnson, Monika; Wang, Li; Fonnesbeck, Christopher; Williams, John V; Halasa, Natasha",The Pediatric infectious disease journal,441,31

METHODS A national sample of 6,607 adults (4.4% who reported testing positive for COVID-19, 25.3% testing negative, and 70.3% untested) were recruited an online platform andcompleted the Patient Health Questionnaire-2, Generalized Anxiety Disorder-2, PTSD-Checklist for DSM-5, the Alcohol Use Disorder Identification-Consumption scale, and an item assessing SI in May-June 2020. A series of multivariable analyses were conducted. RESULTS In the total sample, 35.3% screened positive for current AUD, 33.6% for MDD, 33.6% for GAD, 24.6% for SI, and 20.2% for CS. Past 2-week SI (adjusted odds ratios [AORs]= 1.49-12.06), number of close friends (AORs= 1.40-2.72), history of AUD (AORs= 1.15-1.92), history of anxiety disorder (AORs= 1.07-2.63), and younger age (AORs= 0.97-0.98) were significantly associated with screening positive for MDD, GAD, CS, and AUD. COVID-19 status was not independently associated with these conditions, but the combination of testing positive for COVID-19, meeting criteria for AUD, and screening positive for MDD, GAD, or CS predicted a 96% probability for SI. CONCLUSION Predisposing factors are stronger predictors of psychological distress than personal COVID-19 infection or exposure. The additive effects of COVID-19 infection, alcohol use, and psychiatric problems in predicting SI suggest screening, monitoring, and treating these conditions in population-based prevention and treatment efforts may be important.","Tsai, Jack; Elbogen, Eric B; Huang, Minda; North, Carol S; Pietrzak, Robert H",Journal of affective disorders,441,20

One member of the Elovls family, Elovl4, has been regarded as a critical enzyme involved in the biosynthesis pathway of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs). To explore the role of Elovl4 in PUFA synthesis in Trachinotus ovatus, the cDNA of the Elovl4b gene is cloned from T. ovatus (ToElovl4b). The ORF of ToElovl4b was 918 bp and encoded 305 amino acid (aa) protein sequences. Sequence alignment showed that the deduced amino acids contained significant structural features of the Elovl4 family, such as a histidine box motif (HXXHH), multiple transmembrane domains and an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) retention signal. Moreover, phylogenetic analysis revealed that ToElovl4b was highly conserved with that of Rachycentron canadum Elovl4b. Moreover, heterologous expression in yeast demonstrated that ToElovl4b could efficiently elongate 18:2n-6, 18:3n-6 and 20:5n-3 FAs up to 20:2n-6, 20:3n-6 and 22:5n-3, respectively. Furthermore, the tissue expression profile indicated that mRNA expression of ToElovl4b was higher in the gonads and brain than in other tissues. Additionally, nutritional regulation suggested the highest mRNA levels of ToElovl4b in liver and brain were under feeding with 1:1 FO-SO (fish oil, FO; soybean oil, SO) and 1:1 FO-CO (corn oil, CO)), respectively. These new insights were useful for understanding the molecular basis and regulation of LC-PUFA biosynthesis in fish.","Zhu, Ke-Cheng; Song, Ling; Liu, Bao-Suo; Guo, Hua-Yang; Zhang, Nan; Guo, Liang; Jiang, Shi-Gui; Zhang, Dian-Chang",Gene,441,1

The case-fatality rate is significantly higher in older patients and those with diabetes, cancer or cardiovascular disorders. The human proteins, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) and basigin (BSG), are involved in high-confidence host-pathogen interactions with SARS-CoV-2 proteins. We considered these three proteins as seed nodes and applied the random walk with restart method on the human interactome to construct a protein-protein interaction sub-network, which captures the effects of viral invasion. We found that Insulin resistance, AGE-RAGE signaling in diabetic complications and adipocytokine signaling were the common pathways associated with diabetes, cancer and cardiovascular disorders. The association of these critical pathways with ageing and its related diseases explains the molecular basis of COVID-19 fatality. We further identified drugs that have effects on these proteins/pathways based on gene expression studies. We particularly focused on drugs that significantly downregulate ACE2 along with other critical proteins identified by the network-based approach. Among them, COL-3 had earlier shown activity against acute lung injury and acute respiratory distress, while entinostat and mocetinostat have been investigated for non-small-cell lung cancer.

Our sample comprised 2041 migrant adolescents (46.2% female) from the first two waves of the China Education Panel Survey (CEPS). The results indicated that teacher discrimination (T1) was positively associated with depression (T2). Emotional engagement with school (T1) rather than cognitive engagement with school (T1) partially mediated this association. Moreover, poverty status moderated the direct association between teacher discrimination and migrant adolescents' depression as well as the indirect relationship via emotional school engagement. Specifically, the direct and indirect effects were stronger for migrant adolescents living in poverty than they were for their non-impoverished counterparts.

In all 5 patients the dual lumen balloon microcatheter was used with the objective to cure the lesion and it was successful in all 5 cases. There was no vessel injury, unwanted embolization, retained microcather, microcatheter rupture or cranial nerve deficits in our series. Our mean Onyx injection time was 6.4min (range from 2 to 10min). There were no procedural complications in our series. Four out of 5 patients had angiographic follow up demonstrating persistent angiographic cure (follow up mean 6 months - range 4-7 months). CONCLUSIONS Our experience in this small series of patients indicates that the use of dual lumen balloon microcatheters is safe and feasible, facilitating the use of Onyx for embolization of DAVFs.","Dabus, Guilherme; Linfante, Italo; Martínez-Galdámez, Mario",Clinical neurology and neurosurgery,441,1

The objective of the current post hoc analysis was to evaluate the effect of specific biological and genetic markers on the antidepressant efficacy of adjunctive L-methylfolate 15 mg versus placebo from a trial of inadequate responders to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). METHOD The double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial used the sequential parallel comparison design. Outpatients with SSRI-resistant MDD (DSM-IV criteria) received L-methylfolate 15 mg/d for 60 days, placebo for 30 days followed by L-methylfolate 15 mg/d for 30 days, or placebo for 60 days. The effects of baseline levels of select biological and genetic markers individually and combined on treatment response to L-methylfolate versus placebo were evaluated; the primary response measure was the 28-Item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS-28). The first patient was enrolled July 14, 2009, and the last patient completed April 28, 2011. RESULTS Seventy-five patients were enrolled. Patients with specific biological (body mass index ≥ 30 kg/m², elevated plasma levels of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein or 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal, low S-adenosylmethionine/S-adenosylhomocysteine ratio) and genetic markers at baseline had significantly (P ≤ .05) greater pooled mean change from baseline on the HDRS-28 with L-methylfolate versus placebo. Pooled mean change from baseline on the Clinical Global Impressions-Severity of Illness scale was significantly (P < .05) greater with L-methylfolate versus placebo for most genetic markers. Most combinations of baseline biological and genetic markers predicted significantly (P ≤ .05) greater reductions in pooled mean change from baseline in HDRS-28 scores with L-methylfolate versus placebo. CONCLUSIONS Biomarkers associated with inflammation or metabolism and genomic markers associated with L-methylfolate synthesis and metabolism may identify patients with SSRI-resistant depression who are responsive to adjunctive therapy with L-methylfolate 15 mg. Confirmatory studies are needed.

Vitamin B12 is a poor predictor of functional vitamin B12 status, since deficiencies might even occur within the reference limits. Therefore, vitamin B12 deficiencies with serum vitamin B12 levels are between 140 and 200 pmol/L remain undetected. Methylmalonic acid (MMA), however, will detect these deficiencies as accumulates due to functional intracellular vitamin B12 deficiencies. MMA is a relative expensive analysis and is therefore not generally available. To lower the costs, we only request MMA when vitamin B12 levels are between these levels. As a result, more biochemical deficiencies are found. However, it was not known whether bariatric patients with vitamin B12 levels between 140 and 200 pmol/L would benefit from supplementation. METHOD Bariatric patients with vitamin B12 levels between 140 and 200 pmol/L with (n = 45) and without (n = 45) intramuscular hydroxocobalamin injections were compared. RESULTS Treated patients showed a significant increase of vitamin B12 levels (P < 0.001) and a significant decrease in MMA levels (P < 0.001). Biochemical improvement occurs in both patients with and without clinical symptoms. The control group showed a significant increase of MMA levels (P < 0.001). To examine whether biochemical benefits of vitamin B12 supplementation are correlated with clinical improvement, patient records were checked for complaints. Complaints were disappeared after treatment, while no improvement was seen in untreated patients. CONCLUSION This study shows that all bariatric patients with vitamin B12 levels between 140 and 200 pmol/L benefit clinical and biochemical from vitamin B12 supplementation, regardless the MMA levels.","Smelt, H J M; Smulders, J F; Said, M; Nienhuijs, S W; Boer, A K",Obesity surgery,441,5

BACKGROUND Anastomotic leak is still the most dreaded complication in colorectal surgery. Many risk factors have been identified to date, but multicentric prospective studies on anastomotic leak after colon resection are lacking. METHODS Fifty-two hospitals participated in this prospective, observational study. Data of 3193 patients, operated for colon cancer with primary anastomosis without stoma, were included in a prospective online database (September 2011-September 2012). Forty-two pre-/intraoperative variables, related to patient, tumor, surgical procedure, and hospital, were analyzed as potential independent risk factors for anastomotic leak (60-day follow-up). A nomogram was created to easily predict the risk of anastomotic leak for a given patient. RESULTS The anastomotic leak rate was 8.7%, and widely varied between hospitals (variance of 0.24 on the logit scale). Anastomotic leak significantly increased mortality (15.2% vs 1.9% in patients without anastomotic leak, P < 0.0001) and length of hospitalization (median 23 vs 7 days in uncomplicated patients, P < 0.0001). In the multivariate analysis, the following variables were independent risk factors for anastomotic leak: obesity [P = 0.003, odds ratio (OR) = 2.7], preoperative serum total proteins (P = 0.03, OR = 0.7 per g/dL), male sex (P = 0.03, OR = 1.6), ongoing anticoagulant treatment (P = 0.05, OR = 1.8), intraoperative complication (P = 0.03, OR = 2.2), and number of hospital beds (P = 0.04, OR = 0.95 per 100 beds). CONCLUSIONS Anastomotic leak after colon resection for cancer is a frequent, relevant complication. Patients, surgical technique, and hospital are all important determining factors of anastomotic leak risk.","Frasson, Matteo; Flor-Lorente, Blas; Rodríguez, José Luis Ramos; Granero-Castro, Pablo; Hervás, David; Alvarez Rico, Miguel Angel; Brao, Maria Jesus Garcia; Sánchez González, Juan Manuel; Garcia-Granero, Eduardo",Annals of surgery,441,17

Neurological complications are typically represented by acute ischemic or hemorrhagic lesions, which induce higher morbidity and mortality. The primary goal of this study was to assess the prognostic value of cerebral tissue oxygen saturation (StcO2) on mortality in neonates and young infants treated with ECMO. A secondary objective was to evaluate the association between StcO2 and the occurrence of cerebral lesions. STUDY DESIGN This was a prospective study in infants < 3 months of age admitted to a pediatric intensive care unit and requiring ECMO support. MEASUREMENTS The assessment of cerebral perfusion was made by continuous StcO2 monitoring using near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) sensors placed on the two temporo-parietal regions. Neurological lesions were identified by MRI or transfontanellar echography. RESULTS Thirty-four infants <3 months of age were included in the study over a period of 18 months. The ECMO duration was 10±7 days. The survival rate was 50% (17/34 patients), and the proportion of brain injuries was 20% (7/34 patients). The mean StcO2 during ECMO in the non-survivors was reduced in both hemispheres (p = 0.0008 right, p = 0.03 left) compared to the survivors. StcO2 was also reduced in deceased or brain-injured patients compared to the survivors without brain injury (p = 0.002). CONCLUSION StcO2 appears to be a strong prognostic factor of survival and of the presence of cerebral lesions in young infants during ECMO.","Clair, Marie-Philippine; Rambaud, Jérôme; Flahault, Adrien; Guedj, Romain; Guilbert, Julia; Guellec, Isabelle; Durandy, Amélie; Demoulin, Maryne; Jean, Sandrine; Mitanchez, Delphine; Chalard, François; Sileo, Chiara; Carbajal, Ricardo; Renolleau, Sylvain; Léger, Pierre-Louis",PloS one,441,1

Herein, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to find the association between COVID-19 and cardiovascular complications. We conducted a systematic literature search of the PubMed and Embase databases from 01 December 2019 to 30 November 2020. We then statistically analyzed the incidence of cardiovascular complications in COVID-19 patients. We included 3044 confirmed COVID-19 cases from 12 studies. The most common cardiovascular complications in COVID-19 patients were myocardial injury (21.2%, 95% CI 12.3-30.0%) and arrhythmia (15.3%, 95% CI 8.4-22.3%), followed by heart failure (14.4%, 95% CI 5.7-23.1%) and acute coronary syndrome (1.0%, 95% CI 0.5-1.5%). The pooled incidence of heart failure, arrhythmia and myocardial injury in non-survivors were 47.8% (95% CI 41.4-54.2%), 40.3% (95% CI 1.6-78.9%) and 61.7% (95% CI 46.8-76.6%), respectively. Also, the data separately showed significantly higher incidence of heart failure and cardiac injury in non-survivors (relative risks = 5.13, 95% CI 2.46-10.7, Z = 4.36, P = 0.017) and (relative risks = 6.91, 95% CI 3.19-14.95, Z = 4.91, P = 0.009). Myocardial injury and arrhythmia were the most common complications in COVID-19 patients. Myocardial injury and heart failure were more common in patients who died, regardless of a history of cardiovascular disease. The incidence of heart failure and myocardial injury were higher in non-survivors compared to the survivors. Accordingly, in addition to basic support, cardiac reactions of patients with confirmed COVID-19 with or without underlying cardiovascular diseases should be closely monitored.","Zhao, Yu-Hao; Zhao, Lei; Yang, Xin-Chun; Wang, Pan",Reviews in cardiovascular medicine,441,1

This is the procedure of choice for adrenal tumours at this institution. METHODS Between 1997 and 2008, 112 REAs were performed in a single university centre. Data were retrieved retrospectively from a prospectively collected database, including information on patient demographics, surgical procedure, complications and hospital stay. RESULTS One hundred and twelve REAs were carried out successfully in 105 patients, including seven bilateral adrenalectomies. Thirty-nine patients with unilateral adrenal disease had a phaeochromocytoma, of whom 16 had multiple endocrine neoplasia syndrome type 2, 21 patients had Cushing's disease and 20 had Conn's disease. Median body mass index was 27 (interquartile range 23-29) kg/m(2). The median duration of unilateral operations was 100 (90-130) min with a median blood loss of 5 ml. Median tumour size was 3.1 (2.0-4.4) cm. Conversion from REA to open surgery was needed in two patients. Seven patients experienced postoperative complications (2 major, 5 minor). One patient needed a reoperation. The median postoperative hospital stay was 3 days. A learning curve with a significant decrease in operating time was observed over the years. CONCLUSION REA appears to be a safe and effective surgical technique for adrenal gland tumours up to 6 cm in diameter, with a minimal complication rate.","Schreinemakers, J M J; Kiela, G J; Valk, G D; Vriens, M R; Rinkes, I H M Borel",The British journal of surgery,441,19

Our hypothesis was that a single bolus IO injection of TXA will have a similar pharmacokinetic profile to TXA administered at the same dose IV. METHODS Sixteen male Landrace cross swine (mean body weight 27.6±2.6kg) were divided into an IV group (n=8) and an IO group (n=8). Each animal received 30mg/kg TXA via an IV or IO catheter, respectively. Jugular blood samples were collected for pharmacokinetic analysis over a 3h period. The maximum TXA plasma concentration (Cmax) and corresponding time as well as distribution half-life, elimination half-life, area under the curve, plasma clearance and volume of distribution were calculated. One- and two-way analysis of variance for repeated measures (time, group) with Tukey's and Bonferonni post hoc tests were used to compare TXA plasma concentrations within and between groups, respectively. RESULTS Plasma concentrations of TXA were significantly higher (p<0.0001) in the IV group during the TXA infusion. Cmax occurred at 4min after initiation of the bolus in the IV group (9.36±3.20ng/μl) and at 5min after initiation of the bolus in the IO group (4.46±0.49ng/μl). Plasma concentrations were very similar from the completion of injection onwards. There were no significant differences between the two administration routes for any other pharmacokinetic variables measured. CONCLUSION The results of this study support pharmacokinetic bioequivalence of IO and IV administration of TXA.","Boysen, Søren R; Pang, Jessica M; Mikler, John R; Knight, Cameron G; Semple, Hugh A; Caulkett, Nigel A",The American journal of emergency medicine,441,25

The pathophysiology is far from settled, but a gut microbial dysbiosis is hypothesized to be a contributing factor. We earlier published a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trial on fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) for IBS - the REFIT trial. The present data set describes the engraftment and includes participants from the study who received active FMT; 14 participants with effect of FMT (Effect) and 8 without (No effect). Samples were collected at baseline, after 6 and 12 months. Samples from the transplants (Donor) served as a comparator. In total 66 recipient samples and 17 donor samples were subjected to deep metagenomic sequencing, and taxonomic and functional analyses were performed. Alpha diversity measures showed a significantly increased diversity and evenness in the IBS groups compared to the donors. Taxonomic profiles showed higher relative abundance of phylum Firmicutes, and lower relative abundance of phylum Bacteroidetes, compared to donors at baseline. This profile was shifted toward the donor profile following FMT. Imputed growth rates showed that the resulting growth pattern was a conglomerate of donor and recipient activity. Thirty-four functional subclasses showed distinct differences between baseline samples and donors, most of which were shifted toward a donor-like profile after FMT. All of these changes were less pronounced in the No effect group. We conclude that FMT induces long-term changes in gut microbiota, and these changes mirror the clinical effect of the treatment.

The focus of this double-blinded randomized study was to assess the accuracy of point-of-care ultrasound in verifying the correct position of the ETT and to compare it with the accuracy of auscultation. METHODS Forty-two adult patients requiring general anesthesia with ETT were consented. Patients were randomized to right main bronchus, left main bronchus, or tracheal intubation. After randomization, the ETT was placed via fiber-optic visualization. Next, the location of the ETT was assessed using auscultation by a separate blinded anesthesiologist, followed by an ultrasound performed by a third blinded anesthesiologist. Ultrasound examination included assessment of tracheal dilation via cuff inflation with air and evaluation of pleural lung sliding. Statistical analysis included sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and interobserver agreement for the ultrasound examination (95% CI). RESULTS In differentiating tracheal versus bronchial intubations, auscultation showed a sensitivity of 66% (0.39 to 0.87) and a specificity of 59% (0.39 to 0.77), whereas ultrasound showed a sensitivity of 93% (0.66 to 0.99) and specificity of 96% (0.79 to 1). Identification of tracheal versus bronchial intubation was 62% (26 of 42) in the auscultation group and 95% (40 of 42) in the ultrasound group (P = 0.0005) (CI for difference, 0.15 to 0.52), and the McNemar comparison showed statistically significant improvement with ultrasound (P < 0.0001). Interobserver agreement of ultrasound findings was 100%.

However, access to LVAs is often limited by the quantity and geographic distribution of low-vision providers, as well as patient-centred transportation challenges. A tablet-based LVA tool kit, delivered virtually, has the potential to overcome many of these barriers. The purpose of this research was to validate a key component of the tablet-based tool kit - a commercially available iPad visual acuity (VA) test (Eye Chart Pro) iPad app - in a low-vision population. METHODS Participants with low vision (n = 26) and those who were normally sighted (n = 25) underwent VA testing with both the iPad VA test application and the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) chart. The VA data were compared using a t-test, linear regression and Bland-Altman analysis. RESULTS There was no significant difference in the mean absolute difference in VA (log of minimum angle of resolution (logMAR)=0.11; p = 0.82). Eye Chart Pro and Standard ETDRS Chart measures were also not significantly different (p = 0.98). However, there were significant differences between test methods in the low-vision group and the normally sighted group (p > 0.0001 and p = 0.007, respectively). The Bland-Altman analysis showed a mean bias (difference) of -0.0005 logMAR between methods, and 95% limits of agreement of 0.298 and -0.299 logMAR. DISCUSSION The ETDRS chart function on the Eye Chart Pro application can reliably measure VA across a range, from normally sighted patients to those with low vision.","Hazari, Hassan; Curtis, Rachel; Eden, Karen; Hopman, Wilma M; Irrcher, Isabella; Bona, Mark D",Journal of telemedicine and telecare,441,1

The ability of bats to provide reservoirs of numerous viruses in addition to coronavirusesremains an active area of research. Unique aspects of the physiology of the chiropteran immune system may contributeto the ability of bats to serve as viral reservoirs. The coronavirus spike protein plays important roles in viral pathogenesis and the immune response. Although much attention has focused on the spike receptor-binding domain, a unique aspect of SARS-CoV-2 as compared with its closest relatives is the presence of a furin cleavage site in the S1-S2 region of the spike protein. Proteolytic activation is likely an important feature that allows SARS-CoV-2-and other coronaviruses-to overcome the species barriers and thus cause human disease. The diversity of bat species limits the ability to draw broad conclusions about viral pathogenesis, but comparisons across species and with reference to humans and other susceptible mammals may guide future research in this regard.","Stout, Alison E; Guo, Qinghua; Millet, Jean K; Whittaker, Gary R",Comparative medicine,441,1

This study describes SARS-CoV-2 intranasal infection in ferrets and hamsters with low doses of low-passage SARS-CoV-2 clinical French isolate UCN19, describing infection levels, excretion, immune responses and pathological patterns in both animal species. Individual infection with 103 p.f.u. SARS-CoV-2 induced a more severe disease in hamsters than in ferrets. Viral RNA was detected in the lungs of hamsters but not of ferrets and in the brain (olfactory bulb and/or medulla oblongata) of both species. Overall, the clinical disease remained mild, with serological responses detected from 7 days and 10 days post-inoculation in hamsters and ferrets respectively. The virus became undetectable and pathology resolved within 14 days. The kinetics and levels of infection can be used in ferrets and hamsters as experimental models for understanding the pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2, and testing the protective effect of drugs.","Monchatre-Leroy, Elodie; Lesellier, Sandrine; Wasniewski, Marine; Picard-Meyer, Evelyne; Richomme, Céline; Boué, Franck; Lacôte, Sandra; Murri, Séverine; Pulido, Coralie; Vulin, Johann; Salguero, Francisco J; Gouilh, Meriadeg Ar; Servat, Alexandre; Marianneau, Philippe",The Journal of general virology,441,24

Here, we present a mass spectrometry-based database for rapid and easy identification of saponins henceforth referred to as saponin mass spectrometry database (SMSD). With a total of 4196 saponins, 214 of which were obtained from commercial sources. Through liquid chromatography-tandem high-resolution/mass spectrometry (HR/MS) analysis under negative ion mode, the fragmentation behavior for all parent fragment ions almost conformed to successive losses of sugar moieties, α-dissociation and McLafferty rearrangement of aglycones in high-energy collision induced dissociation. The saccharide moieties produced sugar fragment ions from m/z (monosaccharide) to m/z (polysaccharides). The parent and sugar fragment ions of other saponins were predicted using the above mentioned fragmentation pattern. The SMSD is freely accessible at http://47.92.73.208:8082/ or http://cpu-smsd.com (preferrably using google). It provides three search modes (""CLASSIFY"", ""SEARCH"" and ""METABOLITE""). Under the ""CLASSIFY"" function, saponins are classified with high predictive accuracies from all metabolites by establishment of logistic regression model through their mass data from HR/MS input as a csv file, where the first column is ID and the second column is mass. For the ""SEARCH"" function, saponins are searched against parent ions with certain mass tolerance in ""MS Ion Search"". Then, daughter ions with certain mass tolerance are input into ""MS/MS Ion Search"". The optimal candidates were screened out according to the match count and match rate values in comparison with fragment data in database. Additionally, another logistic regression model completely differentiated between parent and sugar fragment ions. This function designed in front web is conducive to search and recheck. With the ""METABOLITE"" function, saponins are searched using their common names, where both full and partial name searches are supported. With these modes, saponins of diverse chemical composition can be explored, grouped and identified with a high degree of predictive accuracy. This specialized database would aid in the identification of saponins in complex matrices particular in the study of traditional Chinese medicines or plant metabolomics.","Huang, Feng-Qing; Dong, Xuesi; Yin, Xiaojian; Fan, Yang; Fan, Yuanming; Mao, Chencheng; Zhou, Wei",Journal of chromatography.

The authors use the implementation of Treatment Escalation Plans to explore the dynamics shaping the translational journey of a complex intervention from research into the everyday context of real-world healthcare settings. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH A qualitative instrumental collective case study design was used. Data were gathered using qualitative interviews (n = 36) and observations (n = 46) in three English acute hospital trusts. Normalisation process theory provided the theoretical lens and informed data collection and analysis. FINDINGS While each organisation faced the same translational problem, there was variation between settings regarding adoption and implementation. Successful change was dependent on participants' ability to manage and shape contexts and the work this involved was reliant on individual capacity to create a new, receptive context for change. Managing contexts to facilitate the move from research into clinical practice was a complex interactive and iterative process. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS The paper advocates a move away from contextual factors influencing change and adoption, to contextual patterns and processes that accommodate different elements of whole systems and the work required to manage and shape them. ORIGINALITY/VALUE The paper addresses important and timely issues of change in healthcare, particularly for new regulatory and service-oriented processes and practices. Insights and explanations of variations in implementation are revealed which could contribute to conceptual generalisation of context and implementation.","Myall, Michelle; May, Carl; Richardson, Alison; Bogle, Sarah; Campling, Natasha; Dace, Sally; Lund, Susi",Journal of health organization and management,441,11

This article describes 2 conceptual frameworks to guide hospitals and clinics in managing such consequences. One framework was developed to understand the antecedents of psychological effects or ""psychological triggers"" (restricted movement, limited resources, limited information, trauma exposure, and perceived personal or family risk) that cause the emotional, behavioral, and cognitive reactions following large-scale disasters. Another framework, adapted from the Donabedian quality of care model, was developed to guide appropriate disaster response by health care facilities in addressing the consequences of reactions to psychological triggers. This framework specifies structural components (internal organizational structure and chain of command, resources and infrastructure, and knowledge and skills) that should be in place before an event to minimize consequences. The framework also specifies process components (coordination with external organizations, risk assessment and monitoring, psychological support, and communication and information sharing) to support evidence-informed interventions.","Meredith, Lisa S; Eisenman, David P; Tanielian, Terri; Taylor, Stephanie L; Basurto-Davila, Ricardo; Zazzali, James; Diamond, Dickson; Cienfuegos, Barbara; Shields, Sandra",Disaster medicine and public health preparedness,441,26

Severe COVID-19 disease most often presents with pneumonia and complications in acutely ill patients often stem from the lungs. The associations of lung disease, smoking and e-cigarette use with the incidence and severity of COVID-19 are unclear on a population level. METHODS Data on 1761 patients from the Icelandic outpatient Landspitali COVID-19 Clinic were used. The prevalence of smoking, e-cigarette use and underlying lung diseases was calculated in the cohort, with stratification based on age groups and a clinical classification of symptom severity. It was tested whether these prevalences differed between age groups and classes of symptom severity. RESULTS Most patients were in the age group between 35-54 years of age and a large majority had mild symptoms at diagnosis. The prevalence of smoking was 6% with the highest prevalence among 35-54 year olds. The prevalence of e-cigarette use was 4%. It was most prevalent in the age group between 18-34 years. There was no difference in the prevalence of smoking or e-cigarette use between classes of symptom severity. The prevalence of lung disease was 9%. It was higher among older patients and patients with more severe symptoms. CONCLUSION The age distribution and prevalence of lung disease and their risk factors are described in the context of COVID-19 incidence and symptom severity in a whole-nation cohort of Icelanders. The cohort is younger and had less severe symptoms than in many previosly published studies of COVID-19. Interestingly, the prevalences of smoking and e-cigarette use were lower than in the Icelandic general population and they were not associated with symptom severity at diagnosis. To conclude, the results presented here indicate that underlying lung diseases are prevalent among people with severe COVID-19 symptoms but fail to demonstrate an association between cigarette smoking or e-cigarette smoking with COVID-19 severity.","Axelsson, Gisli Thor; Eythorsson, Elias Saebjorn; Hardardottir, Hronn; Gudmundsson, Gunnar; Hansdottir, Sif",Laeknabladid,441,8

Aims: We examined whether suicidal ideation levels among the general population changed owing to the COVID-19 pandemic by tracking individuals between January and April 2020. Method: We used a prospective observational longitudinal design (n = 6,683) and stratified sampling to conduct online surveys of the general adult population in Japan before (baseline) and during the pandemic (follow-up). Results: Suicidal ideation levels were significantly lower during than before the pandemic; however, the effect size was very small. Participants who were younger, with unstable employment, without children, with low income, and receiving psychiatric care were more likely to have higher suicidal ideation levels during the pandemic. Limitations: Because this was an Internet survey and subject to selection bias, the sample was not necessarily representative of the Japanese population. At the time of the survey, COVID-19 cases and deaths in Japan were relatively lower than in other developed countries. The dropout rate may have affected the results. Conclusion: Although the short-term impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on suicidal ideation is limited, relatively young and economically vulnerable individuals are more likely to show exacerbated suicidal ideation during the pandemic.","Sueki, Hajime; Ueda, Michiko",Crisis,441,1

PATIENTS AND METHODS Patients with cancer at Sevier Valley Hospital in Richfield, Utah, were treated with a real-time video-based telehealth program under the care of an oncologist at a tertiary medical center. Data on financial savings, travel hours, mileage avoided, carbon emissions reduced, and revenue retained by Sevier Valley Hospital were collected from 2015 to 2018. RESULTS From 2015 to 2018, 119 patients with cancer in Richfield, Utah, were treated with telehealth for oncology visits, accounting for 1,025 patient encounters. On average, patients saved 4 hours and 40 minutes and 332 miles roundtrip per encounter. In total, patients' savings were estimated to be $333,074. Carbon emissions were reduced by approximately 150,000 kg. Of new patient referrals, 59% were for solid tumors (70 of 119 referrals; 42 metastatic and 28 nonmetastatic cancers), and 41% were hematology consultations (49 of 119 referrals; 28 classical and 21 malignant hematologic conditions). We estimate that Sevier Valley Hospital retained $3,605,500 in revenue over this 4-year period. CONCLUSION Using a telehealth program in rural Utah, patients with cancer benefited from substantial time and monetary savings. The local medical center was able to retain revenue it would have otherwise lost to outsourcing cancer care. Recent regulatory changes to address the COVID-19 pandemic should increase the number of patients with cancer treated via telehealth nationwide.","Thota, Ramya; Gill, David M; Brant, Jamie L; Yeatman, Timothy J; Haslem, Derrick S",JCO oncology practice,441,31

However, the mechanisms underlying the dysregulation of lipid biosynthesis in breast cancer remain largely unknown. Here, we reported that seryl tRNA synthetase (SerRS), a key enzyme for protein biosynthesis, could translocate into the nucleus in a glucose-dependent manner to suppress key genes involved in the de novo lipid biosynthesis. In normal mammary gland epithelial cells glucose can promote the nuclear translocation of SerRS by increasing the acetylation of SerRS at lysine 323. In SerRS knock-in mice bearing acetylation-defective lysine to arginine mutation, we observed increased body weight and adipose tissue mass. In breast cancer cells the acetylation and nuclear translocation of SerRS are greatly inhibited. Overexpression of SerRS, in particularly the acetylation-mimetic lysine to glutamine mutant, dramatically inhibits the de novo lipid synthesis and hence greatly suppresses the proliferation of breast cancer cells and the growth of breast cancer xenografts in mice. We further identified that HDAC4 and HDAC5 regulated the acetylation and nuclear translocation of SerRS. Thus, we identified a SerRS-meditated inhibitory pathway in glucose-induced lipid biosynthesis, which is dysregulated in breast cancer.","Zhao, Jin; Bai, Hangming; Li, Xiaoyu; Yan, Jie; Zou, Gengyi; Wang, Longlong; Li, Xiru; Liu, Ze; Xiang, Rong; Yang, Xiang-Lei; Shi, Yi",Signal transduction and targeted therapy,441,1

The macrophage phenotype in reaction to biomaterials in an inflammatory environment was evaluated in both an in vivo and in vitro setting. METHODS In the in vivo setting, polypropylene (PP) biomaterial was implanted for 28 days in the contaminated abdominal wall of rats, and upon removal analysed by routine histology as well as immunohistochemistry for CD68 (marker for macrophages), inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS - a marker for proinflammatory M1 macrophages) and CD206 (marker for anti-inflammatory M2 macrophages). For the in vitro model, human peripheral blood monocytes were cultured for 3 days on biomaterials made from PP, collagen (COL), polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and PET coated with collagen (PET+COL). These experiments were performed both with and without lipopolysaccharide and interferon γ stimulation. Secretion of both M1- and M2-related proteins was measured, and a relative M1/M2 index was calculated. RESULTS In vivo, iNOS- and CD206-positive cells were found around the fibres of the implanted PP biomaterial. In vitro, macrophages on both PP and COL biomaterial had a relatively low M1/M2 index. Macrophages on the PET biomaterial had a high M1/M2 index, with the highest increase of M1 cytokines in an inflammatory environment. Macrophages on the PET+COL biomaterial also had a high M1/M2 index. CONCLUSION Macrophages in an inflammatory environment in vitro still react in a biomaterial-dependent manner. This model can help to select biomaterials that are tolerated best in a surgical environment at risk of contamination.","Grotenhuis, N; Vd Toom, H F E; Kops, N; Bayon, Y; Deerenberg, E B; Mulder, I M; van Osch, G J V M; Lange, J F; Bastiaansen-Jenniskens, Y M",The British journal of surgery,441,25

We provide prospective data on the safety and efficacy of VARD. DESIGN Multicenter, prospective, single-arm phase 2 study. SETTING Six academic medical centers. PATIENTS We evaluated 40 patients with pancreatic necrosis who had infection determined using Gram stain or culture. INTERVENTIONS Percutaneous drains were placed at enrollment, and computed tomographic scans were repeated at 10 days. Patients who had more than a 75% reduction in collection size were treated with drains. Other patients were treated with VARD. Crossover to open surgery was performed for technical reasons and/or according to surgeon judgment. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Efficacy (ie, successful VARD treatment without crossover to open surgery or death) and safety (based on mortality and complication rates). Patients received follow-up care for 6 months. RESULTS We enrolled 40 patients (24 men and 16 women) during a 51-month period. Median age was 53 years (range, 32-82 years). Mean (SD) Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score at enrollment was 8.0 (5.1), and median computed tomography severity index score was 8. Of the 40 patients, 24 (60%) were treated with minimally invasive intervention (drains with or without VARD). Nine patients (23%) did not require surgery (drains only). For 31 surgical patients, VARD was possible in 60% of patients. Most patients (81%) required 1 operation. In-hospital 30-day mortality was 2.5% (intent-to-treat). Bleeding complications occurred in 7.5% of patients; enteric fistulas occurred in 17.5%. CONCLUSIONS This prospective cohort study supports the safety and efficacy of VARD for infected pancreatic walled-off necrosis. Of the patients, 85% were eligible for a minimally invasive approach. We were able to use VARD in 60% of surgical patients. The low mortality and complication rates compare favorably with open debridement. An unexpected finding was that a reduction in collection size of 75% according to the results of computed tomographic scans at 10 to 14 days predicted the success of percutaneous drainage alone.","Horvath, Karen; Freeny, Patrick; Escallon, Jaime; Heagerty, Patrick; Comstock, Bryan; Glickerman, David J; Bulger, Eileen; Sinanan, Mika; Langdale, Lorrie; Kolokythas, Orpheus; Andrews, R Torrance",Archives of surgery,441,24

Specific patient populations, such as those with cancer and the critically ill, show elevated risk for VTE, bleeding or both, and significant gaps in VTE prophylaxis and treatment exist in these groups. Objective To present novel insights and consolidated evidence collected from experts, clinical practice guidelines and original studies on the unmet needs in thromboprophylaxis, and on the treatment of VTE in two high-risk patient groups: patients with cancer and the critically ill. Methodology To identify specific unmet needs in the management of VTE, a methodology was designed and implemented that assessed gaps in prophylaxis and treatment of VTE through interviews with 44 experts in the field of thrombosis and haemostasis, and through a review of current guidelines and seminal studies to substantiate the insights provided by the experts. The research findings were then analysed, discussed and consolidated by a multidisciplinary group of experts. Results The gap analysis methodology identified shortcomings in the VTE risk assessment tools, patient stratification approaches for prophylaxis, and the suboptimal use of anticoagulants for primary prophylaxis and treatment. Conclusions Specifically, patients with cancer need better VTE risk assessment tools to tailor primary thromboprophylaxis to tumour types and disease stages, and the potential for drug-drug interactions needs to be considered. In critically ill patients, unfractionated heparin is not advised as a first-line treatment option, and the strength of evidence is increasing for direct oral anticoagulants as a treatment option over low-molecular-weight heparins.","Brenner, Benjamin; Hull, Russell; Arya, Roopen; Beyer-Westendorf, Jan; Douketis, James; Elalamy, Ismail; Imberti, Davide; Zhai, Zhenguo",Thrombosis journal,441,1

Of 257 asymptomatic patients who were tested, 58 (23%) received a positive test result. Forty-five (8%) people who received a positive test result were hospitalized for COVID-19. Older age (aged ≥55 vs 18-34) (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] = 13.41; 95% CI, 3.80-47.33) and diabetes mellitus (aHR = 1.99; 95% CI, 1.00-3.95) were significantly associated with hospitalization. CONCLUSIONS A substantial proportion of people tested in New York City jails received a positive test result for COVID-19, including a large proportion of people tested while asymptomatic. During periods of ongoing transmission, asymptomatic screening should complement symptom-driven COVID-19 testing in correctional facilities. Older patients and people with diabetes mellitus should be closely monitored after COVID-19 diagnosis because of their increased risk for hospitalization.","Chan, Justin; Burke, Kelsey; Bedard, Rachael; Grigg, James; Winters, John; Vessell, Colleen; Rosner, Zachary; Cheng, Jeffrey; Katyal, Monica; Yang, Patricia; MacDonald, Ross",Public health reports,441,17

Patients and methods In all patients with acute ischaemic stroke of unknown onset randomised in the WAKE-UP (Efficacy and Safety of magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]-based Thrombolysis in Wake-Up Stroke) trial, blood pressure (BP) was measured before randomisation and after initiation of treatment at regular intervals up to 24 hours. Individual BPV was measured by coefficient of variation (CV) of all BP values. Primary outcome measure was favourable outcome defined by a modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score 0 or 1 at 90 days after stroke. Results BP measurements were available for 498 of 503 patients randomised (177 women [35.5%], mean age [SD] of 65.2 [11.5] years). Systolic BPV was not associated with the treatment effect of thrombolysis (test for interaction, p = 0.46). The adjusted odds ratio (aOR) for favourable outcome with alteplase, adjusted for age, stroke severity and baseline BP on admission, did not show an association across the quintiles of increasing systolic BPV with an aOR 1.89 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.76-4.70) in the lowest quintile to aOR 1.05 (95% CI, 0.43-2.56) in the highest quintile. Higher mean systolic BP was associated with a smaller treatment effect of thrombolysis with a significant interaction (p = 0.033). The aOR for favourable outcome with alteplase decreased with quintiles of increasing mean systolic BP from aOR 3.16 (95% CI, 1.26-7.93) in the lowest quintile to aOR 0.84 (95% CI, 0.34-2.10) in in the highest quintile. Conclusions There was a significant interaction between mean systolic BP and treatment effect of thrombolysis with higher mean systolic BP being associated with poorer outcome. BPV was not associated with outcome after thrombolysis.ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT01525290.","Barow, Ewgenia; Boutitie, Florent; Cheng, Bastian; Cho, Tae-Hee; Ebinger, Martin; Endres, Matthias; Fiebach, Jochen B; Fiehler, Jens; Nickel, Alina; Puig, Josep; Roy, Pascal; Lemmens, Robin; Thijs, Vincent; Muir, Keith W; Nighoghossian, Norbert; Pedraza, Salvador; Simonsen, Claus Z; Gerloff, Christian; Thomalla, Götz",European stroke journal,441,19

RECENT FINDINGS Challenges to obtaining population-based global estimates of critical illness and resources to treat it include the syndrome-based definitions of critical illness, incorrect equating of 'critical illness' with 'admission to an intensive care unit', lack of reliable case ascertainment in administrative data, and short prodrome and high mortality of critical illness, limiting the number of prevalent cases. Modeling techniques will be required to estimate the burden of critical illness and disparities in access to critical care using existing data sources. Demand for critical care is likely to increase, related to urbanization, an aging demographic, and the ongoing wars, disasters, and pandemics, whereas economic crises will likely decrease the ability to pay for it. SUMMARY Major unexplored research and public health questions remain unanswered regarding the worldwide burden of critical illness, variation in resources available for treatment, and strategies to prevent and treat critical illness that are broadly effective and feasible.","Adhikari, Neill K J; Rubenfeld, Gordon D",Current opinion in critical care,441,1

Using a yeast two-hybrid screening approach, we identified 14-3-3 as a binding partner for the M protein of parainfluenza virus 5 (PIV5). Binding in both transfected and PIV5-infected cells was confirmed by coimmunoprecipitation and was mapped to a C-terminal region within the M protein, namely, 366-KTKSLP-371. This sequence resembles known 14-3-3 binding sites, in which the key residue for binding is a phosphorylated serine residue. Mutation of S369 within the PIV5 M protein disrupted 14-3-3 binding and improved the budding of both virus-like particles (VLPs) and recombinant viruses, suggesting that 14-3-3 binding impairs virus budding. 14-3-3 protein overexpression reduced the budding of VLPs. Using (33)P labeling, phosphorylated M protein was detected in PIV5-infected cells, and this phosphorylation was nearly absent in cells infected with a recombinant virus harboring an S369A mutation within the M protein. Assembly of the M protein into clusters and filaments at infected cell surfaces was enhanced in cells infected with a recombinant virus defective in 14-3-3 binding. These findings support a model in which a portion of M protein within PIV5-infected cells is phosphorylated at residue S369, binds the 14-3-3 protein, and is held away from sites of virus budding.","Pei, Zifei; Harrison, Megan S; Schmitt, Anthony P",Journal of virology,441,20

Traffic flow decreased by up to 80% during the lockdown and remained relatively low during the full relaxation (June and July). After the lockdown a significant shift from public transport to private vehicles (+21% in Barcelona) persisted due to the pervasive fear that using public transport might increase the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection, which need to be reverted as soon as possible. NO2 levels fell below 50% of the WHO annual air quality guidelines (WHOAQGs), but those of PM2.5 were reduced less than expected due to the lower contributions from traffic, increased contributions from agricultural and domestic biomass burning, or meteorological conditions favoring high secondary aerosol formation yields. Even during the lockdown, the annual PM2.5 WHOAQG was exceeded in cities within the NE and E regions with high NH3 emissions from farming and agriculture. Decreases in PM10 levels were greater than in PM2.5 due to reduced emissions from road dust, vehicle wear, and construction/demolition. Averaged O3 daily maximum 8-h (8hDM) experienced a generalized decrease in the rural receptor sites in the relaxation (June-July) with -20% reduced mobility. For urban areas O3 8hDM responses were heterogeneous, with increases or decreases depending on the period and location. Thus, after canceling out the effect of meteorology, 5 out of 11 cities experienced O3 decreases during the lockdown, while the remaining 6 either did not experience relevant reductions or increased. During the relaxation period and coinciding with the growing O3 season (June-July), most cities experienced decreases. However, the O3 WHOAQG was still exceeded during the lockdown and full relaxation periods in several cities. For secondary pollutants, such as O3 and PM2.5, further chemical and dispersion modeling along with source apportionment techniques to identify major precursor reduction targets are required to evaluate their abatement potential.","Querol, Xavier; Massagué, Jordi; Alastuey, Andrés; Moreno, Teresa; Gangoiti, Gotzon; Mantilla, Enrique; Duéguez, José Jaime; Escudero, Miguel; Monfort, Eliseo; Pérez García-Pando, Carlos; Petetin, Hervé; Jorba, Oriol; Vázquez, Víctor; de la Rosa, Jesús; Campos, Alberto; Muñóz, Marta; Monge, Silvia; Hervás, María; Javato, Rebeca; Cornide, María J",The Science of the total environment,441,30

This study aimed to determine specific risk factors and prognosis of EC with PC recurrence (PCR) versus no PC recurrence (NPCR). METHODS Data of all patients with EC who received primary surgical treatment between January 2000 and February 2017 were abstracted from the French FRANCOGYN Research Group database. Clinical and pathologic variables were compared between the two groups (PCR vs. NPCR). Multivariate analysis was performed to define prognostic factors for peritoneal recurrence. Overall survivals (OS) of patients after recurrence were compared using the Kaplan-Meier method. RESULTS The study analyzed 1466 patients, and 257 of these patients (17.5%) had recurrence. At presentation, 63 of these patients had PC. International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) stages 3 and 4 disease were significantly associated with PCR versus NPCR (odds ratio 2.24; 95% confidence interval 1.23-4.07; p = 0.008). The death rate for the patients with PC was 47.6%, with a median survival of 12 months after diagnosis of recurrence. According to the histologic subtype, OS was 29 months (Q1-Q3, 13-NA) for endometrioid carcinomas, 7.5 months (Q1-Q3, 4-15) for serous carcinomas, and 10 months (Q1-Q3, 5-15) for clear cell carcinomas. Chemotherapy for treatment of PCR was associated with improved OS after recurrence (OSAR; p = 0.0025). CONCLUSION An initial advanced stage of EC is a risk factor for PCR. For women with PCR, a diagnosis of type 1 EC recurrence more than 12 months after the initial treatment and management of PCR with chemotherapy is associated with improved OSAR. Prospective studies are needed to determine the precise optimal management required in this clinical situation and to assess the relevance of biomarkers to predict the risk of PCR for EC patients.","Gaudet Chardonnet, A; Azaïs, H; Ballester, M; Raimond, E; Bendifallah, S; Ouldamer, L; Coutant, C; Graesslin, O; Touboul, C; Collinet, P; Bricou, A; Huchon, C; Daraï, E; Lavoue, V; Koskas, M; Uzan, C; Canlorbe, G",Annals of surgical oncology,441,1

What moderate chronic hypoventilation adds to obesity on systemic inflammation and endothelial dysfunction remains unknown. QUESTION To compare inflammatory status and endothelial function in OHS versus eucapnic obese patients. METHODOLOGY 14 OHS and 39 eucapnic obese patients matched for BMI and age were compared. Diurnal blood gazes, overnight polysomnography and endothelial function, measured by reactive hyperemia peripheral arterial tonometry (RH-PAT), were assessed. Inflammatory (Leptin, RANTES, MCP-1, IL-6, IL-8, TNFalpha, Resistin) and anti-inflammatory (adiponectin, IL-1Ra) cytokines were measured by multiplex beads immunoassays. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS OHS exhibited a higher PaCO(2), a lower forced vital capacity (FVC) and tended to have a lower PaO(2) than eucapnic obese patients. (HS)-CRP, RANTES levels and glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) were significantly increased in OHS (respectively 11.1+/-10.9 vs. 5.7+/-5.5 mg x l(-1) for (HS)-CRP, 55.9+/-55.3 vs 23.3+/-15.8 ng/ml for RANTES and 7.3+/-4.3 vs 6.1+/-1.7 for HbA1c). Serum adiponectin was reduced in OHS (7606+/-2977 vs 13,660+/-7854 ng/ml). Endothelial function was significantly more impaired in OHS (RH-PAT index: 0.22+/-0.06 vs 0.51+/-0.11). CONCLUSIONS Compared to eucapnic obesity, OHS is associated with a specific increase in the pro-atherosclerotic RANTES chemokine, a decrease in the anti-inflammatory adipokine adiponectin and impaired endothelial function. These three conditions are known to be strongly associated with an increased cardiovascular risk.

OBJECTIVE The objective of this study was to compare changes in motor symptoms of Parkinson's Disease (PD) and the corresponding volume of the electrostatic field (VEF) achieved by DBS programming using GUIDE XT™, a commercially available software for visualization of DBS leads within the patient-specific anatomy from fusions of preoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and postoperative computed tomography (CT) scans, versus standard-of-care clinical programming. METHODS Clinical evaluation was performed to identify the optimal set of parameters based on clinical effects in 29 patients with PD and bilateral directional leads for Subthalamic Nucleus (STN) DBS. A second DBS program was generated in GUIDE XT™ based on a VEsF optimally located within the dorsolateral STN. Reduction of motor symptoms (Movement Disorders Society Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale, MDS-UPDRS) and the overlap of the corresponding VEsF of both programs were compared. RESULTS Clinical and imaging-guided programming resulted in a significant reduction in the MDS-UPDRS scores compared to off-state. Motor symptom control with GUIDE XT™-derived DBS program was non-inferior to standard clinical programming. The overlap of the two VEsF did not correlate with the difference in motor symptom reduction by the programs. CONCLUSIONS Imaging-guided programming of directional DBS leads using GUIDE XT™ is possible without computational background and leads to non-inferior motor symptom control compared with clinical programming. DBS programs based on patient-specific imaging data may thus serve as starting point for clinical testing and may promote more efficient DBS programming.","Waldthaler, Josefine; Bopp, Miriam; Kühn, Nele; Bacara, Bugrahan; Keuler, Merle; Gjorgjevski, Marko; Carl, Barbara; Timmermann, Lars; Nimsky, Christopher; Pedrosa, David J",Brain stimulation,441,31

In a prospective clinical observation study, we evaluated volume-dependent respiratory system compliance in adult patients undergoing ear-nose-throat surgery with ventilation settings chosen empirically by the attending anaesthetist. METHODS In 40 patients, we measured the respiratory variables during intraoperative mechanical ventilation. All measurements were subdivided into 5 min intervals. Dynamic compliance (CRS) and the intratidal volume-dependent CRS curve was calculated for each interval and classified into one of the six specific compliance profiles indicating intratidal recruitment/derecruitment, overdistension or all. We retrospectively compared the occurrences of the respective compliance profiles at PEEP levels of 5 cm H2O and at higher levels. RESULTS The attending anaesthetists set the PEEP level initially to 5 cm H2O in 29 patients (83%), to 7 cm H2O in 5 patients (14%), and to 8 cm H2O in 2 patients (6%). Across all measurements the mean CRS was 61 (11) ml cm H2O(-1) (40-86 ml cm H2O(-1)) and decreased continuously during the procedure. At PEEP of 5 cm H2O the compliance profile indicating strong intratidal recruitment/derecruitment occurred more often (18.6%) compared with higher PEEP levels (5.5%, P<0.01). Overdistension was practically never observed. CONCLUSIONS In most patients, a PEEP of 5 cm H2O during intraoperative mechanical ventilation is too low to prevent intratidal recruitment/derecruitment. The analysis of the intratidal compliance profile provides the rationale to individually titrate a PEEP level that stabilizes the alveolar recruitment status of the lung during intraoperative mechanical ventilation.

Anamorelin (ONO-7643; ANAM) is a novel and selective ghrelin receptor agonist that improves appetite, lean body mass (LBM), body weight, and anorexia. METHODS This multicenter, open-label, single-arm study investigated the efficacy and safety of 100 mg anamorelin in 50 Japanese patients with advanced and unresectable gastrointestinal (colorectal, gastric, or pancreatic) cancer. ANAM was administered once daily over 12 weeks. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients that maintained or gained LBM over the course of the study. Secondary endpoints included changes in LBM, body weight, quality of life (QoL), and nutritional status biomarkers. RESULTS The proportion of patients who responded to treatment was 63.3% (95% CI, 48.3%-76.6%), with a least square mean ± SE change in LBM and body weight from baseline of 1.89 ± 0.36 kg and 1.41 ± 0.61 kg, respectively. Appetite-related questions on the QoL questionnaire showed that ANAM improved appetite. Adverse events occurred in 79.6% of patients, and the most common treatment-related adverse events were increased γ-glutamyl transpeptidase (8.2%), diabetes mellitus (6.1%), hyperglycemia (6.1%), and prolonged QRS complex (6.1%). CONCLUSIONS ANAM improved anorexia and patients' nutritional status, resulting in rapid increases in LBM and body weight in patients with advanced gastrointestinal cancer who had cancer cachexia.

METHODS Adult patients selected on etiology and combination of investigations including plain chest x-ray, computed tomography of chest and abdomen, lung functions in supine and sitting positions, radiological/ultrasonic screening for diaphragmatic movement, and phrenic nerve conduction studies. We incorporated a triportal VATS and Endostitch device for plication, using CO2 insufflation to maximum 12 mm Hg. Bilateral simultaneous plication and high-risk patients were electively admitted to intensive therapy unit postoperatively. RESULTS Thirty-five patients (24 males) had their diaphragm plicated. The mean age was 56.6 years (range = 23-76 years). The mean body mass index was 32.1 (range = 22.2-45.4). Twenty one were right, 13 left, 2 patients had VATS simultaneous bilateral plication, and 1 had sequential VATS bilateral plication. Paralysis was idiopathic in 17, posttraumatic in 5, postremoval of mediastinal tumor in 4, and postcardiac surgery in 3. All patients presented with lifestyle-limiting dyspnea and orthopnea, three were on nocturnal noninvasive ventilation. Five were diabetic and 16 were smokers. The mean supine forced expiratory volume in the first second was 62.5% of predicted. Twenty two were performed by VATS (63%), three converted to thoracotomy, and 13 were open limited thoracotomy (historic). The mean hospital stay was 4.5 days (range = 1-18, mode 2 days). Intensive therapy unit admission was required in six patients for mechanical ventilation 0 to 3 days. Five patients (14%) had no improvement in symptoms. There were no deaths, no 30-day readmissions, and no long-term neuralgia in this series. CONCLUSIONS We found minimal access VATS plication of the diaphragm to be feasible and safe, but no firm conclusions should be drawn from our limited resources. We report the feasibility of concomitant bilateral VATS plication of the diaphragm in two adults, and this was not previously reported in the adult population. There is a need for further good quality, prospective studies, and randomized controlled studies evaluating efficacy of VATS diaphragmatic plication.","Taberham, Rhona J; Raza, Adnan; Alzetani, Aiman; Woo, Edwin B; Chamberlain, Martin H; Koulaxouzidis, George; Amer, Khalid M",Innovations,441,7

Testing capacity must be sufficient during the winter respiratory season when levels of cough and fever are high due to non-COVID-19 causes. This study aims to make predictions about the contribution of baseline cough or fever to future testing demand in the UK. Methods: In this analysis of the Bug Watch prospective community cohort study, we estimated the incidence of cough or fever in England in 2018-2019. We then estimated the COVID-19 diagnostic testing rates required in the UK for baseline cough or fever cases for the period July 2020-June 2021. This was explored for different rates of the population requesting tests and four COVID-19 second wave scenarios. Estimates were then compared to current national capacity. Results: The baseline incidence of cough or fever in the UK is expected to rise rapidly from 154,554 (95%CI 103,083 - 231,725) cases per day in August 2020 to 250,708 (95%CI 181,095 - 347,080) in September, peaking at 444,660 (95%CI 353,084 - 559,988) in December. If 80% of baseline cough or fever cases request tests, average daily UK testing demand would exceed current capacity for five consecutive months (October 2020 to February 2021), with a peak demand of 147,240 (95%CI 73,978 - 239,502) tests per day above capacity in December 2020. Conclusions: Our results show that current national COVID-19 testing capacity is likely to be exceeded by demand due to baseline cough and fever alone. This study highlights that the UK's response to the COVID-19 pandemic must ensure that a high proportion of people with symptoms request tests, and that testing capacity is immediately scaled up to meet this high predicted demand.","Eyre, Max T; Burns, Rachel; Kirkby, Victoria; Smith, Catherine; Denaxas, Spiros; Nguyen, Vincent; Hayward, Andrew; Shallcross, Laura; Fragaszy, Ellen; Aldridge, Robert W",Wellcome open research,441,24

There is a lack of effective treatments for early recovery of oral dietary intake. Rikkunshito (RKT), a Japanese herbal medicine, has been gaining attention as a facilitator of gastric emptying. We evaluated the effects of RKT on DGE after PD. Methods In this prospective, randomized, open-labeled study, patients were randomly allocated before PD in a 1:1 ratio to the RKT group or the control group that received no additional treatment. The RKT group received 2.5 g of RKT three times daily (7.5 g/day) from postoperative day (POD) 1 to POD 21. The primary endpoint was the incidence of DGE. Secondary endpoints were short-term postoperative outcomes including oral dietary intake volume and perioperative changes in levels of the hormones ghrelin and leptin. Patients were observed until hospital discharge. Results Twenty-six patients in each group (n = 52) completed the protocol treatment and were included in the analysis set. There were no statistically significant differences in basic characteristics and operative factors. The overall incidence of DGE was not statistically different between the RKT and control groups (30.8% vs 30.8%, p>0.9999). There were no statistically significant differences in the amount of postoperative oral dietary intake represented by total dietary intake (TDI) up to POD 14 and POD 21, complications, and length of hospital stay. No adverse events related to this study were observed. In the RKT group, total ghrelin and acyl-ghrelin were significantly upregulated and leptin was significantly downregulated earlier than in the control group. Conclusion RKT treatment from POD 1 to 21 did not reduce the incidence of DGE and had no clinically beneficial effect on short-term postoperative outcomes irrespective of changes in hormone levels.","Yamaguchi, Hiroshi; Kimura, Yasutoshi; Imamura, Masafumi; Nagayama, Minoru; Ito, Tatsuya; Kyuno, Daisuke; Kono, Tsuyoshi; Kimura, Akina; Akizuki, Emi; Nishidate, Toshihiko; Okita, Kenji; Nobuoka, Takayuki; Mizuguchi, Toru; Hirata, Koichi; Takemasa, Ichiro",Clinical and experimental gastroenterology,441,22

One origin of DSB sources is replicative stress, a major source of genome instability, especially when the integrity of the replication forks is not properly guaranteed. To complete stalled replication, restarting the fork requires complex molecular mechanisms, such as protection, remodeling, and processing. Recently, a link has been made between DNA damage accumulation and inflammation. Indeed, defects in DNA repair or in replication can lead to the release of DNA fragments in the cytosol. The recognition of this self-DNA by DNA sensors leads to the production of inflammatory factors. This beneficial response activating an innate immune response and destruction of cells bearing DNA damage may be considered as a novel part of DNA damage response. However, upon accumulation of DNA damage, a chronic inflammatory cellular microenvironment may lead to inflammatory pathologies, aging, and progression of tumor cells. Progress in understanding the molecular mechanisms of DNA damage repair, replication stress, and cytosolic DNA production would allow to propose new therapeutical strategies against cancer or inflammatory diseases associated with aging. In this review, we describe the mechanisms involved in DSB repair, the replicative stress management, and its consequences. We also focus on new emerging links between key components of the nuclear envelope, the lamins, and DNA repair, management of replicative stress, and inflammation.","Willaume, Simon; Rass, Emilie; Fontanilla-Ramirez, Paula; Moussa, Angela; Wanschoor, Paul; Bertrand, Pascale",Genes,441,1

One of these is the administration of exogenous surfactant, which is being tested in ongoing clinical trials. AREAS COVERED Exogenous surfactant is a life-saving treatment for premature infants with neonatal respiratory distress syndrome. This treatment has also been tested for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) with limited success possibly due to the complexity of that syndrome. The 60-year history of successes and failures associated with surfactant therapy distinguishes it from many others treatment currently being tested for COVID-19 and provides the opportunity to discuss the factors that may influence the success of this therapy. EXPERT OPINION Clinical data provides a strong rationale for using exogenous surfactant in COVID-19 patients. Success of this therapy may be influenced by the mechanical ventilation strategy, the timing of treatment, the doses delivered, the method of delivery and the preparations utilized. In addition, future development of enhanced preparations may improve this treatment approach. Overall, results from ongoing trials may not only provide data to indicate if this therapy is effective for COVID-19 patients, but also lead to further scientific understanding and improved treatment strategies.","Veldhuizen, Ruud A W; Zuo, Yi Y; Petersen, Nils O; Lewis, James F; Possmayer, Fred",Expert review of respiratory medicine,441,1

This study was carried out to investigate the possible aggravating effect of smoking on the prognosis of patients with COVID-19 pneumonia presenting with pulmonary involvement. Materials and Methods 114 adult patients who received inpatient treatment in our clinic with the diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia between 11 March 2020 and 30 April 2020 were retrospectively included in the study; in particular, they were evaluated in terms of smoking history, severity of disease, need for NIMV and ICU admission, and mortality during their hospitalization. Result The mean age of the 114 patients hospitalized with COVID-19 pneumonia was 51.14 ± 14.97 (range 16-81), and 77 (67.5%) were male. Of the patients, 19 (15.9%) were active smokers, 23 were ex-smokers (20.1%), 72 (63.1%) non-smokers. The effect of smoking on the severity of the disease, length of hospitalization, need for non-invasive mechanical ventilation (NIMV) and intensive care unit (ICU) admission and mortality were not statistically significant. Conclusions The rate of active smoking in patients hospitalized with COVID- 19 is lower than the population average. In this study, no correlation was observed between smoking status and the severity, prognosis and mortality of the disease. Further studies with larger number of patients and case series are needed to better elucidate the relationship between smoking and COVID-19 and the pathophysiologic mechanisms of the effects of smoking on the natural history of COVID-19 pneumonia.","Uğur Chousein, Efsun Gonca; Çörtük, Mustafa; Cınarka, Halit; Tanrıverdi, Elif; Turan, Demet; Yıldırım, Binnaz Zeynep; Sezen, Celal Buğra; Özgül, Mehmet Akif",Tuberkuloz ve toraks,441,12

SARS-CoV2 emerged in Wuhan, Hubei Province of China in December 2019. The COVID19 pandemic has now gripped the entire world with more than 70 million cases and over 1.5 million deaths so far. There no treatment option for COVID19 is in term of a drug or vaccine is currently available. Therefore drug repurposing may only provide a quick method for utilizing existing drugs for a therapeutic option. The virus genome contains several non-structural proteins (NSP) which serve as target for designing of antiviral agents. NSP9 of SARS-CoV2 encodes for a replicase enzyme which is essential for the virus replication in the host cell. In search of potent inhibitors, we have screened FDA approved drugs against NSP9 using in silico methods. Five drugs fluspirilene, troglitazone, alvesco, dihydroergotoxine and avodart were found to have highest affinities with the replicase. The molecular dynamics simulation (MDS) studies demonstrated strong drugs binding and stable NSP9-drugs complexes formation. The findings are also strongly supported by root-mean-square deviation, root-mean-square fluctuation, radius of gyration, and hydrogen bond analysis of the complexes. Principal component analysis showed the stable conformation of NSP9 upon drug binding. It could be inferred that these five drugs individually or in combinations may be used as potential inhibitors of NSP9 of SARS-CoV-2 after exploring their in vivo antiviral potential.

There is a significant amount of fear of acquiring COVID-19 by seeking health care services, which has adversely affected patients by worsening fixable situations. Another challenge is the decrease in diagnostic support for evaluating patients compared with a pre-COVID-19 world. Agencies providing at-home phlebotomy, portable radiology, and support services have had to limit their home visits due to an inability to access personal protective equipment. This loss of diagnostic and therapeutic support has had an emotional toll on patients and their caregivers. COVID-19 has had a tremendous impact on the health and finances of home health aides and their patients. Loss of long-term home health aides has adversely affected younger patients with ailments like Down syndrome as well as older patients with dementia. COVID-19 has also increased pressure on end-of-life decision making. Patients and their families are increasingly opting for palliative care and hospice programming to avoid separation. Families are being forced to consider advance directives under an increased emotional strain as patients become ""persons under investigation"" for COVID-19.

We have undertaken molecular dynamics calculations to better understand oxyanion hole dynamics and thermodynamics. We find that the Zika virus (ZIKV) NS2B/NS3 protease maintains a stable closed conformation over multiple 100-ns conventional molecular dynamics simulations in both the presence and absence of inhibitors. The S1, S2 and S3 pockets are stable as well. However, in two of eight simulations, the A132-G133 peptide bond in the binding pocket of S1' spontaneously flips to form a 310 -helix that corresponds to the inactive conformation of the oxyanion hole, then maintains this conformation until the end of the 100-ns conventional molecular dynamics simulations without inversion of the flip. This conformational change impacts the S1' pocket in ZIKV NS2B/NS3 protease active site, which is important for small molecule binding. The simulation results provide evidence at the atomic level that the inactive conformation of the oxyanion hole is more favored energetically when no specific interactions are formed between substrate/inhibitor and oxyanion hole residues. Interestingly, however, transition between the active and inactive conformation of the oxyanion hole can be observed by boosting the valley potential in accelerated molecular dynamics simulations. This supports a proposed induced-fit mechanism of ZIKV NS2B/NS3 protease from computational methods and provides useful direction to enhance inhibitor binding predictions in structure-based drug design.

The ABCD recognises that there is a wide variation in the design and management of shelters, and that these largely reflect local pressures. These guidelines are written with this diverse audience in mind; they point to the ideal, and also provide for some level of compromise where this ideal cannot immediately be attained. In addition consideration should be given to general requirements in order to optimise overall health and wellbeing of cats within the shelter. HOUSING: Compartmentalisation of the shelter into at least three individual sections (quarantine area for incoming cats, isolation facilities for sick or potentially infectious cats, and accommodation for clinically healthy, retrovirus-negative cats) can facilitate containment of a disease outbreak, should it occur. STANDARD OF CARE: Incoming cats should receive a full health check by a veterinary surgeon, should be dewormed and tested for retrovirus infections (feline leukaemia virus [FeLV] and/or feline immunodeficiency virus [FIV]) in regions with high prevalence and in shelters that allow contact between cats. Cats which are not rehomed should receive a regular veterinary check-up at intervals recommended by their veterinarian. VACCINATION Each cat should be vaccinated as soon as possible against feline panleukopenia virus (FPV), feline herpesvirus (FHV-1) and feline calicivirus (FCV) infections. HYGIENE: Adequate hygiene conditions should ensure that contact between shedders of infectious agents and susceptible animals is reduced as efficiently as possible by movement control, hygiene procedures of care workers, barrier nursing, cleaning and disinfection. STRESS REDUCTION: Stress reduction is important for overall health and for minimising the risk of recrudescence and exacerbation of infectious diseases. In general, a special effort should be made to rehome cats as soon as possible.","Möstl, Karin; Egberink, Herman; Addie, Diane; Frymus, Tadeusz; Boucraut-Baralon, Corine; Truyen, Uwe; Hartmann, Katrin; Lutz, Hans; Gruffydd-Jones, Tim; Radford, Alan D; Lloret, Albert; Pennisi, Maria Grazia; Hosie, Margaret J; Marsilio, Fulvio; Thiry, Etienne; Belák, Sándor; Horzinek, Marian C",Journal of feline medicine and surgery,441,16

Methods We retrospectively analyzed the hematological findings of 72 patients with COVID-19 admitted from January 21 to February 17, 2020. The final date of follow-up was March 20, 2020. Dynamic profile of vital hematological parameters in severe and non-severe patients was presented at different time points (day 1, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15 after admission), and the correlation of hematological parameters with hospitalization time was indicated. Results Of 72 patients with COVID-19, lymphopenia and leukopenia occurred in 39 (54.2%) and 20 (27.8%) patients with COVID-19, respectively. Fifteen (20.8%) patients were defined as severe cases and 57 (79.2%) were non-severe cases. Compared to non-severe patients, leukocyte count, neutrophil count and neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) were significantly higher, whereas lymphocyte count was declined in severe patients at each time point. A growing trend in platelet count was found in non-severe patients over the follow-up period. In addition, a positive correlation of NLR with hospitalization time was detected from day 5 after admission. Conclusions Dynamic changes in vital hematological parameters from severe and non-severe patients had been characterized in the course of hospitalization. During hospitalization, NLR was found to have certain relevance to the hospitalization days and a role in forecasting disease prognosis for patients with COVID-19.","Ding, Xiurong; Yu, Yanhua; Lu, Bichao; Huo, Jianbo; Chen, Ming; Kang, Yanfang; Lou, Jinli; Liu, Zhizhong",Clinical chemistry and laboratory medicine,441,8

The incidence of hypertension was significantly higher (p=0.001) among women with PCOS (17/1000 PY) compared to women without (10/1000 PY). 8,223 women had known PCOS status, of which 681 women (8.3%) had self-reported physician diagnosed PCOS. Incidence rate difference of hypertension (cases attributable to PCOS) was four-fold higher (15.8 vs. 4.3 respectively /1000PY) among obese women with PCOS compared to age-matched lean women with PCOS. PCOS was independently associated with 37% greater risk of hypertension (HR 1.37, 95%CI 1.14-1.65), adjusting for body mass index (BMI), family history of hypertension, occupation and co-morbidity with type 2 diabetes. CONCLUSIONS Women with PCOS are more likely to develop hypertension from early adulthood, independent of BMI, which is further exacerbated by obesity. Including PCOS in hypertension risk stratification assessments may aid efforts in early identification of the disorder.","Joham, Anju E; Kakoly, Nadira S; Teede, Helena J; Earnest, Arul",The Journal of clinical endocrinology and metabolism,441,15

However, this innovative technique has rarely been introduced in pancreatic surgery, as it is considered to be a challenging procedure. We report herein our technique of single-incision laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy with or without splenic preservation. MATERIALS AND SURGICAL TECHNIQUE A 2.5-cm intraumbilical mini-laparotomy was made for the placement of a SILS Port as a single access site. The overall procedures were similar to those performed in the standard laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy with multiple trocars. To obtain better exposure of the operative field, we made technical refinements by employing gastric suspension with sutures, the tug-exposure technique, a balloon retractor, and gravity by changing the patient's position. The pancreas was transected with a linear stapler, and the specimen was extracted through the umbilical wound. DISCUSSION Patients were discharged without any complications. The umbilical wounds were almost invisible 1 month after surgery. We believe that SILS, with some technical refinements, can be safely applied for distal pancreatectomy. Although the cosmetic benefits of single-incision laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy are obvious, several issues such as the extent of invasiveness, cost, indications, and learning curve need to be investigated.","Misawa, Takeyuki; Ito, Ryusuke; Futagawa, Yasuro; Fujiwara, Yuki; Kitamura, Hiroaki; Tsutsui, Nobuhiro; Shiba, Hiroaki; Wakiyama, Shigeki; Ishida, Yuichi; Yanaga, Katsuhiko",Asian journal of endoscopic surgery,441,16

The aim of this study is to determine the interaction between BRAF mutation and microsatellite instability (MSI) status in determining survival benefit after adjuvant 5-FU based chemotherapy in stage III colon cancer. METHODS We performed a retrospective cohort study including all curatively resected stage III colon cancer cases over a 33-year period. A clinicopathological database was collated (adjuvant chemotherapy, age, gender, obstruction, perforation, tumor location, grade, mucin, nodal stage, extramural vascular, and perineural invasion). BRAF (V600E) mutation testing was performed and MSI status established by immunohistochemistry for mismatch repair proteins and molecular testing for National Cancer Institute panel markers. Patients were categorized into four groups for comparison: MSS and BRAF-ve (termed "" traditional""), MSI and BRAF-ve (termed "" presumed Lynch""), MSI and BRAF+ve (termed "" sporadic MSI""), and MSS and BRAF+ve (termed "" other BRAF""). The primary endpoint was cancer specific survival. Interaction testing was conducted to determine whether there were different responses to chemotherapy between groups. RESULTS A total of 686 unselected cases met inclusion criteria and had tissue available, of which 15.7% had BRAF mutation (BRAF+ve) and 13.8% had MSI. Thirty-nine percent received chemotherapy. Overall, adjuvant chemotherapy produced a cancer specific survival benefit (HR 0.66, 95% CI, 0.49-0.88, P < 0.01). On adjusted analysis, neither BRAF nor MSI status were individually predictive of survival benefit. On adjusted analysis specifically of the chemotherapy effect in each subgroup, only patients in the presumed Lynch (HR 0.260, 95% CI, 0.09-0.80, P < 0.01) and other BRAF groups (HR 0.45, 95% CI, 0.23-0.87, P < 0.01) had a significant survival benefit from chemotherapy. On interaction testing of subgroups, adjusting for all the clinicopathological parameters, only patients in the presumed Lynch group (HR 0.277, 95% CI, 0.10-0.75, P < 0.01) gained a differentially greater benefit from chemotherapy than other groups. CONCLUSIONS In this historical cohort, MSI testing is predictive of response to adjuvant chemotherapy in stage III colon cancer, but only when results are interpreted in combination with BRAF. This supports the role of routine testing for these biomarkers.","Chouhan, Hanumant; Sammour, Tarik; Thomas, Michelle L; Moore, James W",Journal of surgical oncology,441,29

METHODS We performed a post hoc analysis using data from the Japan Diabetes Outcome Trial-1. A total of 2607 participants aged 20-65 years with impaired fasting glucose were recruited from the workplace/community in Japan and randomized to a 1-year telephone support programme intervention arm (n = 1240) or self-directed control arm (n = 1367). Participants in both arms received monthly data feedback from a weight scale and pedometer. The main outcome measure was the stages of change toward healthy eating and active exercise. The secondary outcome was fasting plasma glucose (FPG). RESULTS After the 1-year intervention, the adjusted odds ratio of progressing to the action/maintenance stage in the intervention vs. control arm for healthy eating was 1.31 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.21-1.43; p < 0.001), but that for active exercise was 1.07 (95% CI 0.99-1.15; p = 0.062). The intervention decreased FPG levels in participants in the contemplation stage, but not in the precontemplation, preparation and action/maintenance stages. DISCUSSION These findings suggest that the telephone support programme by healthcare providers advanced the stage of changes toward healthy eating in people with prediabetes. In particular, it decreased FPG levels in the contemplation stage.","Sakane, Naoki; Oshima, Yoshitake; Kotani, Kazuhiko; Suganuma, Akiko; Takahashi, Kaoru; Sato, Juichi; Suzuki, Sadao; Izumi, Kazuo; Kato, Masayuki; Noda, Mitsuhiko; Kuzuya, Hideshi",Journal of telemedicine and telecare,441,1

It is not only for the feedback and the improvement of the work, it is also about career development, building networks and increasing visibility. Nevertheless, women continue to be under-represented in these academic events and even more so in the most visible positions such as speaking roles. This paper presents the development of a tool based on performance indicators, which will allow monitoring and evaluating gender roles and inequalities in academic conferences in order to tackle the underrepresentation of women. The study identifies relevant perspectives (participation, organizational structure and attitudes) and designs specific lists of performance indicators for each of them. The tool is based on a combination of two multicriteria techniques, Analytic Hierarchy Process and Analytic Hierarchy Process Sort, and a qualitative analysis based on in-depth interviews and information gathered from a focus group. The use of the AHP multi-criteria decision technique has allowed us to weight the indicators according to the opinion of several experts, and with them to be able to generate from these weightings composite indicators for each of the three dimensions. The most relevant indicators were for the participation dimension. Additionally, the tool developed has been applied to an academic conference which has been monitored in real time. The results are shown as a traffic light visualization approach, where red means bad performance, yellow average performance and green good performance, helping us to present the results for each indicator. Finally, proposals for improvement actions addressed to the red indicators are explained. The work carried out highlights the need to broaden the study of gender equality in academic conferences, not only regarding the participation but also the performance of different roles and functions.","Corona-Sobrino, Carmen; García-Melón, Mónica; Poveda-Bautista, Rocio; González-Urango, Hannia",PloS one,441,17

OBJECTIVES To evaluate the level of learning engagement and its relationship with students' perceived learning satisfaction in an online clinical nursing elective course. DESIGN A prospective interventional study. SETTINGS A nursing course was converted to an online format because of the coronavirus disease COVID pandemic. PARTICIPANTS Part-time post-registration nursing undergraduates enrolled in an elective online clinical course. METHODS Related teaching and learning strategies were deployed in the course using the Community of Inquiry framework. All students who completed the course were invited to complete an online survey that included a validated Online Student Engagement questionnaire (OSE). Pearson's correlations were used to determine the association between perceived learning satisfaction and learning engagement. A logistic regression model was used to explore the associations of gender, age, working experience and perceived learning satisfaction with higher learning engagement. RESULTS The questionnaires were completed by 56 of 68 students (82%). The Pearson's correlation coefficient between the mean perceived learning satisfaction and OSE scores was 0.75 (p < .001). Twenty-five students (45%) were identified as highly engaged, using a cut-off of ≥3.5 for the mean OSE score. The mean perceived learning satisfaction (SD) score differed significantly between highly engaged and not highly engaged students [4.02 (0.49) vs. 3.27 (0.62), p < .001]. The logistic regression model showed that a greater perceived learning satisfaction [adjusted odds ratio (OR): 17.2, 95% C.I.: 3.46-86.0, p = .001] was associated with an increased likelihood of higher learning engagement, and >1 year of working experience (adjusted OR: 0.11, 95% C.I.: 0.01-0.89, p = .0039) was associated with a decreased likelihood of higher learning engagement. CONCLUSIONS The study findings suggest that perceived learning satisfaction predicts learning engagement among nursing students in this online learning course.","Chan, S L; Lin, C C; Chau, P H; Takemura, N; Fung, J T C",Nurse education today,441,12

We previously reported the pro-apoptotic property of the SARS-CoV (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus) M (membrane)-protein and a down-regulation of the phosphorylation level of the cell-survival protein PKB (protein kinase B)/Akt in cells expressing M-protein. We also showed that overexpression of PDK1 (3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase 1), the immediate upstream kinase of PKB/Akt, suppressed M-induced apoptosis. This illustrates that M-protein perturbs the PDK1 and PKB/Akt cell survival signalling pathway. In the present study, we demonstrated that the C-terminus of M-protein interacts with the PH (pleckstrin homology) domain of PDK1. This interaction disrupted the association between PDK1 and PKB/Akt, and led to down-regulation of PKB/Akt activity. This subsequently reduced the level of the phosphorylated forkhead transcription factor FKHRL1 and ASK (apoptosis signal-regulating kinase), and led to the activation of caspases 8 and 9. Altogether, our data demonstrate that the SARS-CoV M-protein induces apoptosis through disrupting the interaction of PDK1 with PKB/Akt, and this causes the activation of apoptosis. Our work highlights that the SARS-CoV M protein is highly pro-apoptotic and is capable of simultaneously inducing apoptosis via initiating caspases 8 and 9. Preventing the interaction between M-protein and PDK1 is a plausible therapeutic approach to target the pro-apoptotic property of SARS-CoV.","Tsoi, Ho; Li, Li; Chen, Zhefan S; Lau, Kwok-Fai; Tsui, Stephen K W; Chan, Ho Yin Edwin",The Biochemical journal,441,8

We aimed to investigate whether the dynamic variation of cytokines was associated with the survival of patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). METHODS A retrospective study was performed on 40 patients with COVID-19 admitted to the ICU in Wuhan, China. Demographic, clinical, and laboratory variables were collected, and serum cytokines were kinetically assessed. A multivariable-adjusted generalized linear regression model was used to analyze the differences in serum cytokine levels between survivors and non-survivors. RESULTS Among the 40 patients included, we found a positive correlation between multiple cytokines. Serum levels of interleukin (IL)-6, IL-10, and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα) in non-survivors were consistently elevated compared to those in the survivors. Kinetic variations in IL-6, IL-8, and IL-10 were associated with a fatal outcome in patients with severe COVID-19, independent of sex, age, absolute lymphocyte count, direct bilirubin, hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and cancer as well as the use of glucocorticoids and tocilizumab. CONCLUSIONS Dynamic changes in serum IL-6, IL-8, and IL-10 levels were associated with survival in patients in the ICU, and could serve as a predictive biomarker to determine the therapeutic options for patients with severe COVID-19.","Li, Jia; Rong, Liu; Cui, Ran; Feng, Jiaqi; Jin, Yuyang; Chen, Xiaoxiang; Xu, Renying",Annals of palliative medicine,441,16

Although we have significantly improved the prognosis of SLE, management remains constrained by a lack of effective, targeted therapies and the lack of evidence-based approaches to the use of existing compounds. For example, for glucocorticoids (GC), which are used continuously in a majority of patients, there are no evidence-based recommendations for initiation, tapering, and cessation in the treatment of SLE. Even today, GC are without alternatives in acute situations, especially organ- or life-threatening ones. However, due to the known long-term adverse effects, the role of GC is viewed increasingly critically.

Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) has generated a lot of controversies whether it is effective in prevention and treatment of COVID-19. Current report presents a 63-year-old woman who has taken HCQ for many years but still infected by COVID-19. CASE PRESENTATION A patient with rheumatoid arthritis came to the clinic with fever and sore throat. The patient has been treated with 200 mg HCQ per day since 2016. Laboratory tests showed that the patient had lymphopenia, increased levels of high-sensitive C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) and serum Interleukin-6 (IL-6). Chest radiography showed that the patient had pneumonia. Throat swab test confirmed COVID-19 positive. On admission, she was treated with nebulized interferon alfa-2b, oral Lopinavir/Ritonavir, and ceftriaxone sodium for the COVID-19 in addition to HCQ. The patient stayed in hospital for 18 days, recovered from oxygen intake, and eventually discharged from hospital. Follow up investigation showed the patient developed antibody against COVID-19.

Purpose: This study aims to determine the feasibility of implementing the telemedicine system and find solutions of its development and resistance by stakeholders. Method and Material: The authors present a unique case of Korea where telemedicine, despite its solid technological base, has not yet gained a foothold 32 years after its first pilot project. A narrative review was condected according to the timeline of government-driven telemedicine adoption in Korea, and an analysis was performed on the tendency of stakeholder resistance. Results: The analysis revealed that the relevant stakeholders were classified into doctors, patients, governments and some political parties. Among stakeholders as a whole, private healthcare physicians, who provide over 90% of primary care in Korea, amount to the largest demographic against the implementation of telemedicine. Their resistance was found to be the product of policies and problems arising from the coexistence of telemedicine and conventional healthcare regimes. With the COVID-19 pandemic, policymakers are at odds with these stakeholders while implementing a pilot project. Conclusion: Fostering smooth policy implementation necessitates adopting an approach that reduces conflicts with private healthcare providers.","Kim, Ah Young; Choi, Woo Seok",Telemedicine journal and e-health : the official journal of the American Telemedicine Association,441,4

While the development of the single antigen bead (SAB) multiplex assay has improved the sensitivity and specificity of HLA-antibody detection, several limitations of the assay (specific to certain sensitized patients) can complicate accurate interpretation of results. In this report, we focus on the ""shared-epitope"" phenomenon, a condition in which antibody strength can be underrepresented, or its presence completely missed, due to binding of the antibody to competing targets on multiple antigens (beads), effectively ""diluting"" the resulting MFI-readout.

Two sound level monitors recorded concurrently for 24 hours at the ICU central stations and adjacent to patients. Sample values to determine levels generated by equipment and external noise were also recorded in an empty ICU side room. RESULTS Average sound levels always exceeded 45 dBA and for 50% of the time exceeded between 52 and 59 dBA in individual ICUs. There was diurnal variation with values decreasing after evening handovers to an overnight average minimum of 51 dBA at 4 AM. Peaks above 85 dBA occurred at all sites, up to 16 times per hour overnight and more frequently during the day. WHO guidelines on sound levels could be only achieved in a side room by switching all equipment off. CONCLUSION All ICUs had sound levels greater than WHO recommendations, but the WHO recommended levels are so low they are not achievable in an ICU. Levels adjacent to patients are higher than those recorded at central stations. Unit-wide noise reduction programmes or mechanical means of isolating patients from ambient noise, such as earplugs, should be considered.","Darbyshire, Julie L; Young, J Duncan",Critical care,441,1

The present research examined what people think it means to be Black and White (e.g., a mixture of Black and White vs. completely Black and completely White) and whether essentialism is indeed negatively associated with such concepts. METHOD We used multiple methodologies (e.g., surveys, open-ended explanations, experimental manipulations) to examine how Black, White, and Black-White perceivers conceptualized Black-White individuals (Studies 1-3) and the extent to which essentialist beliefs, both dispositional (Studies 2-3) and experimentally induced (Study 4), predicted those concepts. RESULTS We find that U.S. Black-White individuals most often conceptualized ""Black and White"" to mean a mixture of Black and White (Study 1), as did U.S. White individuals and U.S. Black individuals (Studies 2 and 3), and that racial essentialism-both dispositional (Studies 2 and 3) and experimentally manipulated (Study 4)-was positively associated with this conception. CONCLUSION Our data shed new light on the complexity of race concepts and essentialism and advance the psychological understanding of Black-White identity.

Researchers have proposed actionable frameworks for implicit bias education, particularly outlining the need to shift from recognition to transformation, with the goal of changing discriminatory behaviors and policies. As simulation educators tasked with training health care professionals, we have an opportunity to meet this need for transformation. Simulation can shift behaviors, but missteps in design and implementation when used to address implicit bias can also lead to negative outcomes. The focus of this article is to provide recommendations to consider when designing simulation-based education to specifically address racism and implicit bias.","Vora, Samreen; Dahlen, Brittany; Adler, Mark; Kessler, David O; Jones, V Faye; Kimble, Shelita; Calhoun, Aaron",Simulation in healthcare : journal of the Society for Simulation in Healthcare,441,17

Atmospheric aerosol samples were collected during two West-East oceanographic cruises across the Mediterranean and in the southwest Black Sea. This comprehensive assessment of baseline concentrations of aerosol phase OPEs, spatial distribution, and related deposition fluxes reveals levels ranging from 0.4 to 6.0 ng m(-3) for the ∑14OPEs and a lack of significant differences among sub-basins. Levels measured across the Mediterranean Sea and in the Black Sea are in the upper range or higher than those from previous reports for the marine atmosphere, presumably due to proximity to sources. From 13 to 260 tons of OPEs are estimated to be annually loaded to the Mediterranean Sea open waters from the atmosphere. Tris-(1-chloro-2-propyl)phosphate (TCPP) was the most abundant compound over the atmosphere of all the Mediterranean and Black Sea sub-basins, and therefore the chemical reaching surface waters at a higher extent by dry deposition. The atmospheric deposition fluxes of phosphorus due to OPE deposition is a significant fraction of known atmospheric inputs of new organic phosphorus (P), suggesting the relevant role that anthropogenic organic pollutants could play in the P cycle.","Castro-Jiménez, Javier; Berrojalbiz, Naiara; Pizarro, Mariana; Dachs, Jordi",Environmental science & technology,441,16

However, even variable regions on the spike tend to be less antigenic and immunogenic than one might have anticipated for external structures. Here we show that the envelope spike of primary viruses has an ability to restrict antibody recognition of variable regions. We show that access to an artificial epitope, introduced at multiple positions across the spike, is frequently limited, even though the epitope has been inserted at surface-exposed regions on the spike. Based on the data, we posit that restricted antibody access may be the result, at least in part, of a rigidification of the epitope sequence in the context of the spike and/or a highly effective flexible arrangement of the glycan shield on primary viruses. Evolution of the HIV envelope structure to incorporate extra polypeptide sequences into nominally accessible regions with limited antibody recognition may contribute to reducing the magnitude of antibody responses during infection and allow the virus to replicate unhindered by antibody pressure for longer periods.","Pantophlet, Ralph; Wang, Meng; Aguilar-Sino, Rowena O; Burton, Dennis R",Journal of virology,441,1

These patients present symptoms that make food intake and nutrient absorption difficult, therefore involving nutritional risk. On the other hand, acute respiratory complications require prolonged ICU stays, and this predisposes to increased malnutrition and loss of skeletal muscle mass and function, which can lead to poor quality of life, disability and morbidity long after discharge. For this reason, the world's leading nutrition societies and associations believe that nutritional therapy should be considered a part of the basic treatment of patients with COVID-19. METHODS we have reviewed and compared 9 expert recommendations (ER) published by nutrition societies and associations from China, Spain, Brazil, Europe, Colombia, Australia, America, and the United Kingdom, in relation to critical and non-critical hospitalized patients due to the COVID-19 pandemic. CONCLUSIONS the 9 ERs reviewed agree on the importance of nutritional management in critical and non-critical hospitalized patients with COVID-19, as well as on the early detection of nutritional risk, the intervention, and subsequent follow-up.

During spermiogenesis, histones in post-meiotic spermatids are removed from chromatin and replaced by protamines. Although histone-to-protamine exchange is important for sperm nuclear condensation, the underlying regulatory mechanism is still poorly understood. Here, we identify PHD finger protein 7 (PHF7) as an E3 ubiquitin ligase for histone H3K14 in post-meiotic spermatids. Generation of Phf7-deficient mice and Phf7 C160A knockin mice with impaired E3 ubiquitin ligase activity reveals defects in histone-to-protamine exchange caused by dysregulation of histone removal factor Bromodomain, testis-specific (BRDT) in early condensing spermatids. Surprisingly, E3 ubiquitin ligase activity of PHF7 on histone ubiquitination leads to stabilization of BRDT by attenuating ubiquitination of BRDT. Collectively, our findings identify PHF7 as a critical factor for sperm chromatin condensation and contribute to mechanistic understanding of fundamental phenomenon of histone-to-protamine exchange and potential for drug development for the male reproduction system.","Kim, Chang Rok; Noda, Taichi; Kim, Hyunkyung; Kim, Gibeom; Park, Seongwan; Na, Yongwoo; Oura, Seiya; Shimada, Keisuke; Bang, Injin; Ahn, Jun-Yeong; Kim, Yong Ryoul; Oh, Se Kyu; Choi, Hee-Jung; Kim, Jong-Seo; Jung, Inkyung; Lee, Ho; Okada, Yuki; Ikawa, Masahito; Baek, Sung Hee",Cell reports,441,16

Recently published data reported convincing results with thromboaspiration devices such as the Penumbra System (Penumbra, Alameda, CA, USA) combined with supple reperfusion catheters by using the ADAPT (A Direct Aspiration First-Pass Thrombectomy) technique. The aim of this study was to report our initial experience with the 3MAX (3.8 F) reperfusion catheter for the recanalization of distal intracranial arteries. METHODS From August 2015 to December 2016, 32 consecutive patients (16 females, 50%; mean age = 67.4 ± 18.7 years, range: 22-91) for 38 distal occlusions underwent mechanical thrombectomy (MT) by thromboaspiration using the 3MAX. Median NIHSS score at admission was 14 (IQR: 9-19). Distal occlusions were distributed as follows: M2 (n: 23), M3 (n: 6), P1 (n: 3), P2 (n: 2), P3 (n: 2), A3 segment (n: 1) and superior cerebellar artery (n: 1). RESULTS In 1/38 (2.6%) target artery, the 3MAX could not be navigated. Of the 37 (59.5%) remaining arteries, 22 were successfully reperfused (TICI 2b/3) after ADAPT with the 3MAX alone. Additional stent retriever thrombectomy allowed a 76.3% final reperfusion rate. Good functional outcome (mRS ≤2) was obtained in 45.5% of patients at 3 months. Three (9.4%) 3MAX-related complications occurred: 2 emboli to new territory (ENT) and one vascular perforation. CONCLUSIONS The 3MAX is well-navigable in distal arteries making it useful as a frontline technique. However, the reperfusion rate with the 3MAX catheter alone seems lower than the ones reported with stent retrievers for such distal occlusions.","Premat, Kévin; Bartolini, Bruno; Baronnet-Chauvet, Flore; Shotar, Eimad; Degos, Vincent; Muresan, Paul; Di Maria, Federico; Gabrieli, Joseph; Rosso, Charlotte; Pistocchi, Silvia; Chiras, Jacques; Sourour, Nader; Alamowitch, Sonia; Samson, Yves; Clarençon, Frédéric",Clinical neuroradiology,441,30

In Ethiopia, its prevalence is low, but it results in devastative health problems of the mother and her baby. Even though the Ethiopian government and nongovernmental organizations tried to strengthen the health care system, significant adverse maternal and fetal outcome is still associated with uterine rupture. The aim of this study was to identify determinants of uterine rupture in Jinka and Arba Minch General Hospitals. METHODS The study was conducted in Jinka and Arba Minch General Hospitals, and the data collection period was 15 to 30 November 2018. A case-control study design was used with simple random sampling of 1:4. Data were collected using data extraction sheets. Variables with p < 0.25 in bivariate logistic regression were entered into multivariable logistic regression. Variables with p < 0.05 in multivariable logistic regression were used to determine significant association between dependent and independent variables.

METHODS Among 153 patients who underwent esophageal cancer surgery at our hospital, 17 (11.1%) underwent MAE and 37 (24.2%) underwent TSE. RESULTS Many of the MAE group patients had pulmonary (P < 0.001), cardiovascular (P = 0.031), or hepatic (P = 0.0029) diseases preoperatively, and these comorbidities frequently overlapped (P < 0.0001). The %VC and FEV(1)/FVC were lower (P = 0.0099 and P = 0.0057, respectively), and the ICG-R15 and serum level of HbA1c were higher (P = 0.0014 and P = 0.043, respectively) in the MAE group. There were no differences in postoperative complications or in the modified Clavien classification between the groups. There was no mortality in either group. After MAE, 5 (29.4%) patients died of other diseases. The 5-year overall survival rate after MAE was poorer than that after TSE (56.1 vs. 71.8%), but the 5-year cause-specific survival rates were similar in the two groups.

This may be related to fewer events of abnormal Doppler flow, however the prevalence of absent or reversed end diastolic flow (AEDF or REDF) in such women is unknown. In this systematic review, we aimed to synthesise available data on the prevalence of AEDF or REDF. METHODS We searched PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, CENTRAL and Global Index Medicus with no date, setting or language restrictions. All randomized or non-randomized studies reporting AEDF or REDF prevalence based on Doppler assessment of umbilical arterial flow > 20 weeks' gestation were eligible. Two authors assessed eligibility and extracted data on primary (AEDF and REDF) and secondary (fetal, perinatal, and neonatal mortality, caesarean section) outcomes, with results presented descriptively. RESULTS A total of 42 studies (18,282 women) were included. Thirty-six studies reported zero AEDF or REDF cases. However, 55 AEDF or REDF cases were identified from just six studies (prevalence 0.08% to 2.13%). Four of these studies were in unselected-risk women and five were conducted in high-income countries. There was limited evidence from low- and middle-income countries. CONCLUSIONS Evidence from largely observational studies in higher-income countries suggests that AEDF and REDF are rare among low- and unselected-risk pregnant women. There are insufficient data from lower-income countries and further research is required.","Vogel, Joshua P; Vannevel, Valerie; Robbers, Gianna; Gwako, George; Lavin, Tina; Adanikin, Abiodun; Hlongwane, Tsakane; Pattinson, Robert C; Qureshi, Zahida P; Oladapo, Olufemi T",Reproductive health,441,24

It was hypothesized that PROB could potentially affect the disposition of OATP1B drug substrates. The plasma levels of the OATP1B endogenous biomarker candidates, including coproporphyrin I (CPI), CPIII, hexadecanedioate (HDA), and tetradecanedioate (TDA), were examined in 14 healthy subjects treated with PROB. After oral administration with 1,000 mg PROB alone and in combination with furosemide (FSM), AUC(0-24h) values were 1.39 {plus minus} 0.21- and 1.57 {plus minus} 0.41-fold higher than predose levels for CPI and 1.34 {plus minus} 0.16- and 1.45 {plus minus} 0.57-fold higher for CPIII. Despite increased systemic exposures, no decreases in CPI and CPIII renal clearance (CLR) were observed (0.97 {plus minus} 0.38- and 1.16 {plus minus} 0.51-fold for CPI, and 1.34 {plus minus} 0.53- and 1.50 {plus minus} 0.69-fold for CPIII, respectively). These results suggest that the increase of CP systemic exposure is caused by OATP1B inhibition. Consistent with this hypothesis, PROB inhibited OATP1B1- and OATP1B3-mediated transport of CPI in a concentration-dependent manner, with IC50 values of 167 and 76.0 µM, respectively, in transporter overexpressing cell assay. The inhibition potential was further confirmed by CPI and CPIII hepatocyte uptake experiments. Taken together, these findings indicate that PROB displays weak OATP1B inhibitory effects in vivo and CP is a sensitive endogenous probe of OATP1B inhibition. This study provides an explanation for the heretofore unknown mechanism responsible for PROB's interactions. Significance Statement This study suggested that PROB is a weak clinical inhibitor of OATP1B based on the totality of evidence from the clinical interaction between PROB and CP, and the in vitro inhibitory effect of PROB on OATP1B-mediated CP uptake. It demonstrates a new methodology of utilizing endogenous biomarkers to evaluate complex DDI, providing explanation for the heretofore unknown mechanism responsible for PROB's inhibition. It provides evidence to strengthen the claim that CP is a sensitive circulating endogenous biomarker of OATP1B inhibition.","Zhang, Yueping; Holenarsipur, Vinay K; Kandoussi, Hamza; Zeng, Jianing; Mariappan, T Thanga; Sinz, Michael; Shen, Hong",Drug metabolism and disposition: the biological fate of chemicals,441,1

One explanation for the conflicting results could be differences in ethnic background of study subjects. In this study we investigated the association of MBL deficiency and SLE in a large cohort of Brazilian SLE patients and controls. METHODS Serum MBL and Complement levels were determined for 286 Brazilian adult SLE patients and 301 healthy Brazilian adults as controls. MBL deficiency was classified as mild (<1000 and ≥500μg/L), moderate (<500 and ≥100μg/L) or severe (<100μg/L). RESULTS SLE patients presented higher frequency of mild and moderate MBL deficiency compared to controls. SLE patients with MBL deficiency presented higher frequency of lupus nephritis compared to those without MBL deficiency. MBL deficiency was not associated with any other clinical manifestation, use of immunosuppressant therapy, disease activity, disease severity serum or Complement levels. CONCLUSION This study shows that an association between MBL deficiency and SLE does exist in the Brazilian population. We also found an association between MBL deficiency and lupus nephritis. These findings support the hypothesis that MBL deficiency contributes to the development of SLE and lupus nephritis.","Perazzio, Sandro Félix; Silva, Neusa Pereira da; Carneiro-Sampaio, Magda; Andrade, Luis Eduardo Coelho",Revista brasileira de reumatologia,441,30

METHODS After PROSPERO registration (CRD42021228755), the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines were utilized. The search terms 'Grasper Integrated Flexible Cystoscope', and 'Isiris', within the following databases: PubMed, Scopus, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, and EMBASE were searched. RESULTS In this review, a cumulative total experience (10 publications) included 970 'SUGIFC' procedures (755 patients). However, only 366/970 procedures were actually used for 'ureteral stent removal', with the remainder being surveillance cystoscopy only (603/970) or foreign body retrieval (1/970). Procedure-related and device failures in planned 'removal of ureteral stents', was reported in 8/366 (346 patients) and 1/366 (346 patients) respectively. The cost-benefit utilizing the SUGIFC device is advantageous compared to 'in-theatre' stent removals and favours less busy centres where maintenance, repair, and replacement costs are more relevant. Other listed benefits include shorter stent indwelling times, shorter procedure duration, lower rates of bacteriuria and urinary tract infections, fewer Emergency Department visits and lower readmission rates. Technical limitations include the absence of an independent working channel, a narrower visual field, and the lack of image universality since the monitor is device-specific. CONCLUSION The SUGIFC device needs to be outweighed against local costs and individual health systems. Its application in ambulatory ureteral stent removal may become significant due to the accessibility and convenience that it offers the attending urologist.","Adam, Ahmed; Lawrentschuk, Nathan; Bhattu, Amit Satish; Nagdee, Jameel",ANZ journal of surgery,441,7

The aim of this study was to investigate the influence of radionuclide-chelator complexes on the biodistribution pattern of the 111In-labeled bombesin antagonist PEG2-D-Phe-Gln-Trp-Ala-Val-Gly-His-Sta-Leu-NH2 (PEG2-RM26) and to identify an optimal construct for SPECT imaging. A series of RM26 analogs N-terminally conjugated with NOTA, NODAGA, DOTA and DOTAGA via a PEG2 spacer were radiolabeled with 111In and evaluated both in vitro and in vivo. The conjugates were successfully labeled with 111In with 100% purity and retained binding specificity to GRPR and high stability. The cellular processing of all compounds was characterized by slow internalization. The IC50 values were in the low nanomolar range, with lower IC50 values for positively charged natIn-NOTA-PEG2-RM26 (2.6 ± 0.1 nM) and higher values for negatively charged natIn-DOTAGA-PEG2-RM26 (4.8 ± 0.5 nM). The kinetic binding studies showed KD values in the picomolar range that followed the same pattern as the IC50 data. The biodistribution of all compounds was studied in BALB/c nu/nu mice bearing PC-3 prostate cancer xenografts. Tumor targeting and biodistribution studies displayed rapid clearance of radioactivity from the blood and normal organs via kidney excretion. All conjugates showed similar uptake in tumors at 4 h p.i. The radioactivity accumulation in GRPR-expressing organs was significantly lower for DOTA- and DOTAGA-containing constructs compared to those containing NOTA and NODAGA. 111In-NOTA-PEG2-RM26 with a positively charged complex showed the highest initial uptake and the slowest clearance of radioactivity from the liver. At 4 h p.i., DOTA- and DOTAGA-coupled analogs showed significantly higher tumor-to-organ ratios compared to NOTA- and NODAGA-containing variants. The NODAGA conjugate demonstrated the best retention of radioactivity in tumors, and, at 24 h p.i., had the highest contrast to blood, muscle and bones.","Mitran, Bogdan; Varasteh, Zohreh; Selvaraju, Ram Kumar; Lindeberg, Gunnar; Sörensen, Jens; Larhed, Mats; Tolmachev, Vladimir; Rosenström, Ulrika; Orlova, Anna",International journal of oncology,441,1

Iron liberated from necrotic cells may catalyze free radical production and amplify lipid peroxidation causing membrane dysfunction and multiorgan failure. Consequently, iron chelators have been successfully utilized in various experimental and clinical models of cytokine storm and multiorgan damage, such as in ischemia-reperfusion injury, sepsis and infections. Since viral replication may be influenced by iron accumulation, iron chelation has been proven beneficial in a variety of viral infections, such as HIV-1, hepatitis B virus, Mengo virus, Marburg hemorrhagic fever, Enterovirus 71 and West Nile virus. In this commentary we elaborate on the idea of considering iron chelation, as therapeutic modality in patients with severe COVID-19 infection. For critically ill patients in ICU, intravenous deferoxamine would provide sufficient and rapid iron chelation to ameliorate cytokine storm, whereas in less severe cases an oral chelator could prevent the development of excessive inflammatory response.","Vlahakos, Vassilios D; Marathias, Katerina P; Arkadopoulos, Nikolaos; Vlahakos, Demetrios V",Artificial organs,441,12

BACKGROUND Hospital design plays an important role in providing high-quality and cost-effective facilities for any healthcare system. Spain and Italy face contemporary challenges (i.e., elderly population, staff retention, and obsolete healthcare facilities) and have similar issues of life expectancy, health expenditure, hospital beds provision, and decentralized tax-financed healthcare systems. METHOD A cross-sectional, mixed-method study was used. This involved two different data collection strategies and analysis for each area of investigation: (i) education and (ii) practice. For the former, educational programs were reviewed via a web search; for the latter, an online survey of 53 architectural/engineering offices involved in hospital design was conducted. RESULTS Hospital design education is limited to 0/58 in Spanish and 2/60 courses in Italian universities, although each country offers three postgraduate courses. The practitioners' survey shows that even though their offices have a long history of healthcare design, only 48% in Spain and 60% in Italy have received specific university training. Office staff lack employees with medical backgrounds, which hinders any partnership between health and design fields either for design practice or the education fields. Laws, national regulations, technical guidelines, and previous experience are the most useful information sources, while international scientific publications appear underused by practitioners. CONCLUSIONS Italian and Spanish healthcare architecture could be improved by promoting multidisciplinary teams (in practice and education) and improving the education offer by tailoring it to national needs.","Cambra-Rufino, Laura; Brambilla, Andrea; Paniagua-Caparrós, José León; Capolongo, Stefano",HERD,441,11

In this study, we acknowledge the falciform ligament as a feasible and convenient substitute for mesenteric and portal vein reconstruction with high reliability and patency for local advanced pancreatic tumor. Methods A retrospective single-center analysis. Between June 2017 and January 2018, a total of eleven consecutive patients underwent pancreatic resections with venous reconstruction using falciform ligament. Among them, venous resection was performed in nine cases by wedge and in two cases by full segment. Patency rates and perioperative details were reviewed. Results Mean clamping time of the mesenteric-portal blood flow was 34 min, while perioperative mortality rate was 0%. By means of Duplex ultrasonography, nine patients were shown to be patent on the day of discharge, while two cases revealed an entire occlusion of the mesenteric-portal axis. Orthograde flow demonstrated a mean value of 34 cm/s. All patent grafts on discharge revealed persistent patency within various follow-up assessments. Conclusion The falciform ligament appears to be a feasible and reliable autologous tissue for venous blood flow reconstruction with high postoperative patency. Especially the possibility of customizing graft dimensions to the individual needs based on local findings allows an optimal size matching of the conduit. The risk of stenosis and/or segmental occlusion may thus be further reduced.","Malinka, T; Klein, F; Denecke, T; Pelzer, U; Pratschke, J; Bahra, M","HPB surgery : a world journal of hepatic, pancreatic and biliary surgery",441,19

Sociodemographic and clinical characteristics, Pelvic Organ Prolapse Quantification results, and recorded surgical data (eg, duration of surgery, intraoperative complications, additional prolapse and incontinence surgeries) were obtained from patient files and the hospital's database. Information from postoperative follow-up visits, including complications and anatomical results, were also recorded. RESULTS The mean age of the patients was 60.7 ± 9.1 years. The mean total operative time was 121.3 ± 22.7 minutes. The mean operative time for vaginal hysterectomy, vNOTES sacrocolpopexy, and vNOTES uterosacral ligament suspension was 46 ± 11.9, 65 ± 38, 25 ± 8.2 minutes, respectively.

DESIGN Interrupted time series (ITS) analysis. SETTING Nsambya Hospital, Uganda. PARTICIPANTS Live births and stillbirths. INTERVENTIONS PND audit. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES Primary outcomes: perinatal mortality rate, stillbirth rate, early neonatal mortality rate. SECONDARY OUTCOMES case fatality rates (CFR) for asphyxia, complications of prematurity and neonatal sepsis. RESULTS 526 PNDs were audited: 142 (27.0%) fresh stillbirths, 125 (23.8%) macerated stillbirths and 259 (49.2%) early neonatal deaths. The ITS analysis showed a decrease in perinatal death (PND) rates without the introduction of PND audits (incidence risk ratio (IRR) (95% CI) for time=0.94, p<0.001), but an increase in PND (IRR (95% CI)=1.17 (1.0 to -1.34), p=0.0021) following the intervention. However, when overdispersion was included in the model, there were no statistically significant differences in PND with or without the intervention (p=0.06 and p=0.44, respectively). Stillbirth rates exhibited a similar pattern. By contrast, early neonatal death rates showed an overall upward trend without the intervention (IRR (95% CI)=1.09 (1.01 to 1.17), p=0.01), but a decrease following the introduction of the PND audits (IRR (95% CI)=0.35 (0.22 to 0.56), p<0.001), when overdispersion was included. The CFR for prematurity showed a downward trend over time (IRR (95% CI)=0.94 (0.88 to 0.99), p=0.04) but not for the intervention. With regards CFRs for intrapartum-related hypoxia or infection, no statistically significant effect was detected for either time or the intervention. CONCLUSION The introduction of PND audit showed no statistically significant effect on perinatal mortality or stillbirth rate, but a significant decrease in early neonatal mortality rate. No effect was detected on CFRs for prematurity, intrapartum-related hypoxia or infections. These findings should encourage more research to assess the effectiveness of PND reviews on perinatal deaths in general, but also on stillbirths and neonatal deaths in particular, in low-resource settings.","Kirabira, Victoria Nakibuuka; Aminu, Mamuda; Dewez, Juan Emmanuel; Byaruhanga, Romano; Okong, Pius; van den Broek, Nynke",BMJ open,441,1

RESULTS A total of 14 observational studies, including 904 patients, were eligible for analysis. Ten studies were designed as prospective cohort studies; three studies included selected patients from a cohort while one study was of a retrospective design. We found a significant correlation between higher values of cell-free DNA and higher mortality. This significant correlation was evident as early as on intensive care unit admission. Likewise, cell-free DNA predicted the severity of trauma and posttraumatic complications in a majority of patients. CONCLUSION The amount of cell-free DNA can function as a prognostic tool for mortality and to a lesser extent severity of trauma and posttraumatic complications.

OBJECTIVE We aimed to study the predictive power of the decrease in LA strain in AF population and hypothesize that the difference in LA strain between reference values could be used in a stratified way for prognostication. METHODS Echocardiography examination was performed using the GE system. The standard score of LA strain (ZLA) was calculated, and patients were classified into five groups: Z0 (0 to -1), Z-1 (-1 to -2), Z-2 (-2 to -3), Z-3, (-3 to -4), and Z-4 (≤-4). The clinical end point was an ischemic stroke. RESULTS Among 1,364 subjects with AF (71.4 ± 12.1 years; 55.6%, men), 105 encountered ischemic strokes during a mean follow-up duration of 3.1 ± 1.6 years. No patients in the Z0 and Z-1 groups encountered ischemic stroke. The Kaplan-Meier analysis showed higher rates of stroke in worse ZLA groups. Compared with the Z-2 group, a significantly increased risk of stroke was found in the Z-3 (hazard ratio [HR], 3.697; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.966-6.951; p < 0.001) and Z-4 (HR, 6.447; 95% CI, 2.990-13.904; p < 0.001) groups in univariate Cox regression analysis. The results remained consistent after multivariate Cox regression analysis.

A randomized trial.,10.739071,3.9893525,2014,"BACKGROUND The many risks associated with opioid therapy for chronic noncancer pain (CNCP) have led to questions about use. This is particularly relevant for risk of increased mortality. However, underlying medical conditions of those using opioids may influence mortality findings due to confounding by indication. Similarly, non-opioid analgesics are also associated with an increased risk of mortality, too. METHODS We have conducted a systematic review of propensity score matched observational studies comparing mortality associated with opioid use compared to non-opioid analgesics. Clinicaltrials.gov, Google Scholar, MEDLINE and Scopus were searched from inception to July 2020. Propensity score matched observational studies comparing opioids to non-opioid analgesics in real world settings were analysed. Primary outcome was pooled adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) of all-cause death. Effects were summarized by a random effects model. RESULTS Four studies with seven study arms and 120 186 patients were analyzed. Pooled aHR for all-cause death was 1.69 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.47, 1.95). When mortality risk was confined to out-of-hospital deaths, the pooled aHR was 2.12 (95% CI 1.46, 3.09). The most frequent cause of death was cardiovascular death. Before matching, patients with opioids were older and had more somatic diseases than patients with non-opioids. Despite extensive propensity score matchings and sensitivity analyses, all studies could not fully exclude confounding by indication. CONCLUSIONS Possibly, opioids are associated with an increased all-cause mortality risk compared to non-opioid analgesics. When considering treatment options for patients with CNCP, the possible risk of increased all-cause mortality with opioids should be discussed.","Tölle, Thomas; Fitzcharles, Mary-Ann; Häuser, Winfried",European journal of pain,441,24

Early recognition and intervention can positively affect quality of care and patient safety. This study investigated the prevalence, work, and lifestyle factors affecting BO among OPs in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA). METHODS An online survey was conducted among MENA OPs between February 10 and March 15, 2020, using the validated Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI) of emotional exhaustion (EE), depersonalization (DP), and personal accomplishment (PA), including questions regarding demography/work-related factors and attitudes toward oncology. Data were analyzed to measure BO prevalence and risk factors and explore a screening question for BO. RESULTS Of 1054 respondents, 1017 participants (64% medical oncologists, 77% aged <45 years, 55% female, 74% married, 67% with children, 40% practiced a hobby) were eligible. The BO prevalence was 68% with high levels of EE and DP (35% and 57% of participants, respectively) and low PA scores (49%). Burnout was significantly associated with age <44 years, administrative work >25%/day, and the thought of quitting oncology (TQ). Practicing a hobby, enjoying oncology communication, and appreciating oncology work-life balance were associated with a reduced BO score and prevalence. North African countries reported the highest BO prevalence. Lack of BO education/support was identified among 72% of participants and TQ predicted burnout in 77%. CONCLUSIONS This is the largest BO study in MENA. The BO prevalence was high and several modifiable risk factors were identified, requiring urgent action. TQ is a simple and reliable screening tool for BO. This article is protected by copyright.

However, past work demonstrates that access is not uniform among youth in the United States, with lower access found among groups with higher health-related needs. Population-level data yield important insights about access and internet use in the United States. OBJECTIVE The aim of this study is to examine internet access and mode of access by social class and race and ethnicity among youth (aged 14-17 years) in the United States. METHODS Using the Current Population Survey, we examined internet access, cell phone or smartphone access, and modes of connecting to the internet for adolescents in 2015 (unweighted N=6950; expanded weights N=17,103,547) and 2017 (unweighted N=6761; expanded weights N=17,379,728). RESULTS Internet access increased from 2015 to 2017, but socioeconomic status (SES) and racial and ethnic disparities remained. In 2017, the greatest disparities were found for youth in low-income households (no home access=23%) and for Black youth (no home access=18%) and Hispanic youth (no home access=14%). Low-income Black and Hispanic youth were the most likely to lack home internet access (no home access, low SES Black youth=29%; low SES Hispanic youth=21%). The mode of access (eg, from home and smartphone) and smartphone-only analyses also revealed disparities. CONCLUSIONS Without internet access, web-based dissemination of information, health promotion, and health care will not reach a significant segment of youth. Currently, SES and racial and ethnic disparities in access prolong health inequalities. Moreover, the economic impact of COVID-19 on Black, Hispanic, and low-income communities may lead to losses in internet access for youth that will further exacerbate disparities.","Dolcini, M Margaret; Canchola, Jesse A; Catania, Joseph A; Song Mayeda, Marissa M; Dietz, Erin L; Cotto-Negrón, Coral; Narayanan, Vasudha",Journal of medical Internet research,441,5

Six-year experience of revisional bariatric surgery from an Asian center of excellence.,10.572659,3.9810438,2015,"Norovirus (NoV) is one of the main causative agents of acute gastroenteritis worldwide. In temperate climates, outbreaks peak during the winter season. The mechanism by which climatic factors influence the occurrence of NoV outbreaks is unknown. We hypothesized that humidity is linked to NoV seasonality. Human NoV is not cultivatable, so we used cultivatable murine norovirus (MNV) as a surrogate to study its persistence when exposed to various levels of relative humidity (RH) from low (10% RH) to saturated (100% RH) conditions at 9 and 25°C. In addition, we conducted similar experiments with virus-like particles (VLPs) from the predominant GII-4 norovirus and studied changes in binding patterns to A, B, and O group carbohydrates that might reflect capsid alterations. The responses of MNV and VLP to humidity were somewhat similar, with 10 and 100% RH exhibiting a strong conserving effect for both models, whereas 50% RH was detrimental for MNV infectivity and VLP binding capacity. The data analysis suggested that absolute humidity (AH) rather than RH is the critical factor for keeping NoV infectious, with an AH below 0.007 kg water/kg air being favorable to NoV survival. Retrospective surveys of the meteorological data in Paris for the last 14 years showed that AH average values have almost always been below 0.007 kg water/kg air during the winter (i.e., 0.0046 ± 0.0014 kg water/kg air), and this finding supports the fact that low AH provides an ideal condition for NoV persistence and transmission during cold months.","Colas de la Noue, Alexandre; Estienney, Marie; Aho, Serge; Perrier-Cornet, Jean-Marie; de Rougemont, Alexis; Pothier, Pierre; Gervais, Patrick; Belliot, Gaël",Applied and environmental microbiology,441,16

Continuing our exploration of the possibilities of those molecules, we chose to design alternative molecules with maintained antigen recognition, but enhanced capacity, by fusing 4 VHH with 1 Fc, the fragment crystallizable region of antibodies. In doing so, we aimed at having a molecule with superior quantitative antigen recognition (x 4) while maintaining its size below the 110 kDa. In the present paper, we described the building of those molecules that we coined VHH2 -Fc-VHH2 . The structure of VHH2 -Fc-VHH2 in complex with HER2 antigen was determined using electronic microscopy and modelling. The molecule is shown to bind four HER2 proteins at the end of its flexible arms. VHH2 -Fc-VHH2 also shows an internalization capacity via HER2 receptor superior to the reference anti-HER2 monoclonal antibody, Herceptin®, and to a simple fusion of 2 VHH with 1 Fc (VHH2 -Fc). This new type of molecules, VHH2 -Fc-VHH2 , could be an interesting addition to the therapeutic arsenal with multiple applications, from diagnostic to therapy. This article is protected by copyright.

METHODS This study is a retrospective analysis of all patients with reducible or irreducible, uncomplicated RVH who underwent surgical management from January 2012 to June 2018. RESULTS Out of 222 patients, 186 (83.8%) were female, and 36 (16.2%) were male. The mean age was 54.1 ± 10.1 years; an average body mass index was 31 kg/m2 (19-47.9). The most common previous abdominal operations among female patients were cesarean sections (43.5%) and abdominal hysterectomy (36.6%). Most of the patients had a history of open mesh repair (43.7%) and open anatomical repair (36.9%). The median time of recurrence was 4 years (1-33 years). The median defect size was 10 cm2 (range 2-150 cm2), and 73% defects were in the midline. Total 181 of 222 (81.6%) patients underwent laparoscopic intraperitoneal onlay mesh plus (L-IPOM+), 19 (8.5%) laparoscopic-assisted IPOM+, 17(7.7%) laparoscopic anatomical repair, while remaining 5 (2.3%) patients required open mesh reconstruction. The median size of the composite mesh used was 300 cm2 (150-600 cm2). The mean operating time was 145 (30-330) min, and median blood loss was 15 (5-110) ml. The median hospital stay was 3 days, and median follow-up period was 37 months. The post-operative symptomatic seroma rate was 3.1%, and re-recurrence rate was 1.4%.

This study reports the first clinical experience with AS. Methods All intracranial aneurysms treated by stent-assisted coiling using a single AS in a single institution were retrospectively evaluated. Patient demographics, aneurysm characteristics, angles between the parent artery and stented branch, technical success, and clinical and angiographic follow-up were analyzed. Results Fifty-five consecutive aneurysms treated with AS-assisted coiling were included. Of these, 69.1% were located distal to the circle of Willis. Technical success rate was 100%. The mean diameters of proximal and distal parent arteries were 2.62 mm (range 1.5-4.4) and 1.8 mm (range 0.8-3.5), respectively. Except for a minor stroke in a patient who completely discontinued antiplatelet therapy on postoperative day 4, there were no clinical events with permanent sequelae, and 94.1% of patients had Raymond-Roy score of 1 or 2 aneurysmal occlusion at a mean follow-up duration of 7.9 months. Although the angle between the parent artery and the stented branch increased significantly ( p < 0.001) with time, the angular change at follow-up was only 16.45 ± 11.03 degrees and was inversely correlated both with preoperative angle and the diameter of the distal parent artery ( r = -0.465 and r = -0.433, respectively, p = 0.004 for both). Conclusion AS-assisted coiling was associated with a favorable early clinical outcome and angiographic results in this series. This stent can be used for distally located aneurysms and results in minimal alteration of the arterial anatomy.","Cay, Ferdi; Peker, Ahmet; Arat, Anıl","Interventional neuroradiology : journal of peritherapeutic neuroradiology, surgical procedures and related neurosciences",441,33

Whether intravenous thrombolysis (IVT) improves functional outcome in acute ischemic stroke patients with CMBs is unknown. We aimed to estimate the treatment effect of IVT in patients with acute ischemic stroke and a high burden (>10) of CMBs. Methods- We devised a multistep algorithm to model 90-day modified Rankin Scale scores in patients with ≤10 versus >10 CMBs who do or do not receive IVT. Parameters were extracted from recently published meta-analyses and included pairwise relationships between CMBs, IVT, 3-month functional outcome, and intracranial hemorrhage. Uncertainty was quantified in probabilistic sensitivity analyses. Results- In patients with >10 CMBs as compared with ≤10 CMBs, point estimates of the odds ratios for favorable outcome (modified Rankin Scale ≤2) associated with IVT were 7% to 10% lower but still >1 (range, 1.03-1.51). On the other hand, IVT in patients with >10 CMBs significantly increased the odds of mortality. The point estimates for the net treatment effect of IVT (change in the utility-weighted modified Rankin Scale score) in patients with >10 CMBs were in favor of withholding IVT in older patients with more severe strokes and longer treatment delays. However, because the general pretest probability of >10 CMBs is low (0.6%-2.7%), pretreatment magnetic resonance imaging to quantify CMB burden would be justified only if it delayed IVT by <10 minutes. Conclusions- High CMB burden modifies the treatment effect of IVT. In patients with >10 CMBs, IVT is associated with higher mortality and, in older patients with severe strokes and longer treatment delays, a net utility loss. Patients with higher-than-average pretest probability of >10 CMB might profit from magnetic resonance imaging screening if it does not increase the treatment time.","Schlemm, Ludwig; Endres, Matthias; Werring, David J; Nolte, Christian H",Stroke,441,11

Stress is associated with alterations in eating behavior which may be partly driven by effects on food-related motivation. To investigate effects of COVID-related stress on food motivation, we recruited adults (N=429; 272 F, 157 M) to complete an online survey via Amazon MTurk in May 2020. Current COVID-related stress, retrospective pre-COVID stress, and motivation in relation to individualized preferred foods from five categories (sweet snacks, fruit, savory snacks, vegetables, and fast food) were assessed. Food motivation measures included willingness to wait, willingness to expend low effort [finger taps], willingness to expend high effort [jumping jacks], and willingness to pay for hypothetical delivery of the food item. Food motivation for each food type was assessed using a novel instrument designed for brief assessment of multiple aspects of food motivation across multiple food types. Participants were willing to pay the most for fast food followed by sweet snacks, and willing to wait longer for sweet snacks relative to other food types. While fast food and sweets also generated the most willingness to expend high and low effort, willingness to expend low effort for fruit was similar to that for fast food and sweets, and willingness to expend high effort for fruit was comparable to that for fast food. Participants were least willing to pay or expend low effort for vegetables. Higher COVID-related stress levels were associated with willingness to expend more effort and pay more for food items. Our These data collected during the pandemic demonstrate that highly processed and sweet foods have high motivating value across multiple measures of motivation, and COVID-related stress increases food motivation across food categories. Interventions to mitigate stress and target the link between stress and overeating may help to limit the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on obesity.","Smith, Kimberly R; Jansen, Elena; Thapaliya, Gita; Aghababian, Anahys H; Chen, Liuyi; Sadler, Jennifer R; Carnell, Susan",Appetite,441,28

We further explored other effects of this formula in accordance with the theory of Traditional Chinese Medicine on anemia-related hemogram parameters for ""nourishing blood"" and uterine artery pulsatility index (PI) for ""blood stagnation."" DESIGN Data were assessed for post-hoc analysis from 76 young women from the Taipei metropolitan area of Taiwan who participated in the randomized double-blind clinical trial. Analysis of variance and t test were used to examine the treatment effect between and within the Four-Agents-Decoction and placebo groups. OUTCOME MEASURES In addition to pain intensity, anemia-related hemogram parameters, uterine artery PI, menstruation characteristics, and blood pressure were compared. RESULTS Compared to placebo, biochemical indicators for anemic status did not change differently after the treatment with Four-Agents-Decoction (Si Wu Tang). The changes in uterine artery PI, menstrual pain intensity, and blood pressure were statistically greater in the active treatment group than in the placebo group. In the 25 women receiving ultrasound examination on the same menstruation day, the directions of the changes in both PI and in visual analog scale (VAS) pain intensity aligned well. The changes in the left PI, right PI, and VAS pain intensity in the Four-Agents-Decoction group were -0.391 +/- 0.861, -0.344 +/- 1.03, and -0.251 +/- 2.02 cm; those in the placebo group were 0.208 +/- 1.10, 0.372 +/- 1.06, and 0.438 +/- 2.98 cm, respectively. Inversely, the changes in blood pressure were 11.4 +/- 10.5 mm Hg for systolic blood pressure and 8.36 +/- 8.65 mm Hg for diastolic pressure for the Four-Agents-Decoction group and 6.36 +/- 8.66 and 2.91 +/- 11.2 mm Hg, respectively, for the placebo group. The directions of the changes did not shift, nor did the values change drastically, after adjusting for the level at screening cycle. CONCLUSIONS The anemia status evaluated in conventional medicine does not readily explain the effect of ""nourishing blood"" by Four-Agents-Decoction (Si Wu Tang) from this exploratory study. Although we did not find strong statistical significance of treatment effect, the decreased PI and extra blood pressure elevation may indicate an improvement of ""blood stagnation"" in the Four-Agents-Decoction group. The added information warrants a further larger clinical trial with an increased power to enhance our understanding of the efficacy, the dose-response relationship, and the mode of action of this ancient formula for treating primary dysmenorrhea.","Yeh, Lan Lan Liang; Liu, Jah-Yao; Liu, Yu-Shen; Lin, Kao-Si; Tsai, Te-Feng; Wang, Li-Hsiang",Journal of alternative and complementary medicine,441,16

Previous work identified a dibasic endoplasmic reticulum retrieval signal in the cytoplasmic tail of SARS-CoV S that promotes efficient interaction with SARS-CoV M. The dibasic signal was shown to be important for concentrating S near the virus assembly site rather than for direct interaction with M. Here, we investigated the sequence requirements of the SARS-CoV M protein that are necessary for interaction with SARS-CoV S. The SARS-CoV M tail was shown to be necessary for S localization in the Golgi region when the proteins were exogenously coexpressed in cells. This was specific, since SARS-CoV M did not retain an unrelated glycoprotein in the Golgi. Importantly, we found that an essential tyrosine residue in the SARS-CoV M cytoplasmic tail, Y(195), was important for S-M interaction. When Y(195) was mutated to alanine, M(Y195A) no longer retained S intracellularly at the Golgi. Unlike wild-type M, M(Y195A) did not reduce the amount of SARS-CoV S carbohydrate processing or surface levels when the two proteins were coexpressed. Mutating Y(195) also disrupted SARS-CoV S-M interaction in vitro. These results suggest that Y(195) is necessary for efficient SARS-CoV S-M interaction and, thus, has a significant involvement in assembly of infectious virus.","McBride, Corrin E; Machamer, Carolyn E",Journal of virology,441,1

Most of the studies selected reported positive effects from use of vitamin D for prevention or treatment of COVID-19. However, there was little quantitative data to assess the real impact of using this vitamin as an intervention against this disease. CONCLUSIONS Current studies on vitamin D used for purposes other than bone health promotion cannot be taken as support to justify its use in a disease as recent as COVID-19. Studies of greater robustness, with higher levels of clinical evidence, need to be conducted. Rational use of this vitamin needs to be ensured, thereby minimizing the impacts on the patient and the public healthcare system.","Chagas, Stephanye Carolyne Christino; Moreira, Francisca Sueli Monte; Barbosa, Irla Carla França; Leal Júnior, Osvaldo de Sousa; Leal, Leila Bastos; Santana, Davi Pereira de",Sao Paulo medical journal = Revista paulista de medicina,441,17
134991,134991,134991,Improving vision for surgeons during laparoscopy: the Enhanced Laparoscopic Vision System (ELViS).,10.937769,4.041299,2021-03-01,"Our developed wire ultrasound surgical instrument comprises a bolt-clamped Langevin ultrasonic transducer (BLUT) fabricated by PMN-PZT single crystal material due to high mechanical quality factor and electromechanical coupling coefficient, a waveguide in the handheld instrument, and a generator instrument. To ensure high performance of wire ultrasound surgical instruments, the BLUT should vibrate at an accurate frequency because the BLUT's frequency influences hemostasis and the effects of incisions on blood vessels and tissues. Therefore, we implemented a BLUT with a waveguide in the handheld instrument using a developed assembly jig process with impedance and network analyzers that can accurately control the compression force using a digital torque wrench. A generator instrument having a main control circuit with a low error rate, that is, an output frequency error rate within ±0.5% and an output voltage error rate within ±1.6%, was developed to generate the accurate frequency of the BLUT in the handheld instrument. In addition, a matching circuit between the BLUT and generator instrument with a network analyzer was developed to transfer displacement vibration efficiently from the handheld instrument to the end of the waveguide. Using the matching circuit, the measured S-parameter value of the generator instrument using a network analyzer was -24.3 dB at the resonant frequency. Thus, our proposed scheme can improve the vibration amplitude and accuracy of frequency control of the wire ultrasound surgical instrument due to developed PMN-PZT material and assembly jig process.","Kim, Jungsuk; Kim, Kyeongjin; Choe, Sun-Ho; Choi, Hojong",Sensors,441,8

Pigs infected with TGEV often suffer secondary infection by other pathogens, which aggravates the severity of diarrhea, but the mechanisms remain unknown. Here, we hypothesized that persistent TGEV infection stimulates the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), and thus enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) can more easily adhere to generating cells. Intestinal epithelial cells are the primary targets of TGEV and ETEC infections. We found that TGEV can persistently infect porcine intestinal columnar epithelial cells (IPEC-J2) and cause EMT, consistent with multiple changes in key cell characteristics. Infected cells display fibroblast-like shapes; exhibit increases in levels of mesenchymal markers with a corresponding loss of epithelial markers; have enhanced expression levels of interleukin-1β (IL-1β), IL-6, IL-8, transforming growth factor β (TGF-β), and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) mRNAs; and demonstrate increases in migratory and invasive behaviors. Additional experiments showed that the activation of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) signaling pathways via TGF-β is critical for the TGEV-mediated EMT process. Cellular uptake is also modified in cells that have undergone EMT. TGEV-infected cells have higher levels of integrin α5 and fibronectin and exhibit enhanced ETEC K88 adhesion. Reversal of EMT reduces ETEC K88 adhesion and inhibits the expression of integrin α5 and fibronectin. Overall, these results suggest that TGEV infection induces EMT in IPEC-J2 cells, increasing the adhesion of ETEC K88 in the intestine and facilitating dual infection.IMPORTANCE Transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) causes pig diarrhea and is often followed by secondary infection by other pathogens. In this study, we showed that persistent TGEV infection induces an EMT in porcine intestinal columnar epithelial cells (IPEC-J2) and enhances the adhesion of the secondary pathogen ETEC K88. Additional experiments suggest that integrin α5 and fibronectin play an important role in TGEV-enhanced ETEC K88 adhesion. Reversal of EMT reduces the expression of integrin α5 and fibronectin and also reduces ETEC K88 adhesion. We conclude that TGEV infection triggers EMT and facilitates dual infection. Our results provide new insights into secondary infection and suggest that targeted anti-EMT therapy may have implications for the prevention and treatment of secondary infection.","Xia, Lu; Dai, Lei; Yu, Qinghua; Yang, Qian",Journal of virology,441,31

OBJECTIVE To describe trends in composition of uroliths in cats and evaluate risk factors related to age, breed, sex, urolith location, and bacterial urolith cultures. SAMPLE POPULATION A total of 3940 uroliths and the cats from which they were obtained. METHODS The database of the UC Davis Gerald V. Ling Urinary Stone Analysis Laboratory was searched for all urolith submissions from cats between January 2005 and December 2018. Mineral type, age, breed, sex, and urolith location and culture results were recorded. Trends were evaluated and variables compared to evaluate risk factors. RESULTS A significant decrease in the proportion of calcium oxalate (CaOx)-containing uroliths occurred over time (P = .02), from 50.1% (204/407) of all submissions in 2005 to 37.7% (58/154) in 2018. In contrast, the proportion of struvite-containing uroliths increased significantly (P = .002), from 41.8% (170/407) in 2005 to 54.5% (84/154) in 2018. The proportion of CaOx-containing uroliths in the upper urinary tract was significantly higher compared to the proportion of other urolith types in the upper urinary tract. Urate-containing uroliths were the third most common type (361/3940, 9.2%). Overall, sex and age predispositions were similar to those reported previously. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE The decrease in the proportion of CaOx-containing uroliths and increase in the proportion of struvite-containing uroliths warrants investigation. Further education regarding the efficacy of medical dissolution of struvite-containing uroliths is recommended.","Kopecny, Lucy; Palm, Carrie A; Segev, Gilad; Larsen, Jennifer A; Westropp, Jodi L",Journal of veterinary internal medicine,441,16

METHODS this report on the above terminology and classification combines the input of members of the Standardization and Terminology Committees of two International Organizations, the International Urogynecological Association (IUGA) and the International Continence Society (ICS) and a Joint IUGA/ICS Working Group on Complications Terminology, assisted at intervals by many expert external referees. An extensive process of 11 rounds of internal and external review took place with exhaustive examination of each aspect of the terminology and classification. Decision-making was by collective opinion (consensus). RESULTS a terminology and classification of complications related directly to the insertion of prostheses and grafts in female pelvic floor surgery has been developed, with the classification based on category (C), time (T) and site (S) classes and divisions, that should encompass all conceivable scenarios for describing insertion complications and healing abnormalities. The CTS code for each complication, involving three (or four) letters and three numerals, is likely to be very suitable for any surgical audit or registry, particularly one that is procedure-specific.

OBJECTIVE To investigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the clinical practices of spine surgeon within the Asia Pacific region. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA COVID-19 pandemic had changed spine surgeons clinical practices and their concerns towards personal and family risk of infection. METHODS This cross-sectional survey was carried out from 4 May 2020 to 4 June 2020. The questionnaire was administered using REDCAP (Vanderbilt, Nashville, TN, USA). The online questionnaire includes four section. First section- surgeon's demographics, background, type of clinical practice, and status of pandemic in their country. Second- volume and the type of spine surgery practice prior to the COVID pandemic. Third- changes of clinical practice during the pandemic and lastly- regarding their concern on COVID transmission. RESULTS Total of 222 respondents from 19 countries completed the questionnaire. During the pandemic, 92.3% of the respondents felt their clinical practice was affected. 58.5% respondents reported reduced outpatient clinic hours and 74.6% respondents reported reduced operation theatre hours due to the enforcement by the hospital administration. The mean reduction of clinic volume for all countries was 48.1%. There was a significant reduction in the number of surgeries performed in Japan, Malaysia, India, Philippines, and South Korea. This was due to reduced patient load. More than 60% of respondents were worried being infected by COVID-19 virus and more than 68% were worried to transmit to their family members. CONCLUSION COVID-19 pandemic had significantly affected the clinical and surgical practice of spine surgeons in the Asia Pacific region. Clinics were closed or the practice hours reduced. Similarly, surgical theatres were closed, reduced, or limited to semi-emergency and emergency surgeries. Spine surgeons were moderately concerned of contracting COVID-19 during their clinical practice but were extremely concerned to transmit this disease to their family members.

Although intact skin is subject to sensitization via highly irritating allergens, such as poison ivy, acutely inflamed and chronically inflamed skin is subject to sensitization to allergens without inherent irritant potential. In the chronically inflamed state of atopic dermatitis, sensitization to proteins, such as food, also carries a risk for systemic contact dermatitis via ingestion of the allergen. Minimizing the development of irritant dermatitis is key to preventing sensitization. However, in patients with already chronically inflamed skin, reducing the use of products to the involved areas, recommending hypoallergenic products with caution, and taking measures to prevent biofilm formation are also integral to preventing sensitization to chemicals and proteins, such as food and commensal organisms.","Nedorost, Susan; Hammond, Margaret",International journal of women's dermatology,441,1

A retrospective cohort study was conducted by reviewing 83 patients hospitalized in Guanggu district, Wuhan Third Hospital, China. Clinical histories, laboratory findings and outcome data were collected. Eighteen patients had hypomagnesemia during hospitalization. Fourteen patients were in the critical group and six died. In the critical group, serum magnesium (0.72 ± 0.15 mmol/L) was much lower than that in the moderate and severe groups. At the same time, we also found that several indicators are correlated with the level of magnesium. The level of magnesium was positively associated with the lymphocyte count (r = 0.203, P = 0.004) and platelet count (r = 0.217, P = 0.002) but negatively related to the levels of CRP (r = -0.277, P = 0.000), LDH (r = -0.185, P = 0.011) and α-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase (r = -0.198, P = 0.008) in the critical group.

METHODS Computed tomography (CT) fluoroscopy-guided dual marking with hookwire and (99m)Tc-phytate was performed on 36 small and superficial pulmonary nodules of 34 patients, just before the needlescopic procedure. This method was carried out through one introducer needle, after an initial single puncture. After detection of the hookwire-marked site through needlescopy, the precise lesion was confirmed using a thoracoscopic gamma probe by calculating the highest radioactivity. The pulmonary nodule was resected and diagnosed by pathologic examination. RESULTS The mean size of the nodules was 12.5 ± 5.4 mm (range 3-20), and their mean distance from the pleural surface was 5.6 ± 5.8 mm (range 0-18.7). The time of the dual localization procedure was 10.8 ± 3.6 min (range 5-18). Pneumothorax was developed in 6 of 34 patients (17.6 %) after preoperative localization, but did not require any treatment. Seven hookwires dislodged during the operation. Nevertheless, radiotracer markings detected on a gamma probe guided a successful wedge resection without difficulty in all seven cases. All nodules were successfully resected under needlescopy, except conversion to the 5-mm-sized thoracoscopy in four patients due to pleural adhesion. CONCLUSIONS Dual marking with radiotracer and hookwire under CT fluoroscopy is a safe and not time-consuming procedure, and has made needlescopy-assisted lung resection for small and superficial nodules or ground-glass opacity lesions easier, more convenient, and less hazardous.","Doo, Kyung Won; Yong, Hwan Seok; Kim, Hyun Koo; Kim, Sungeun; Kang, Eun-Young; Choi, Young Ho",Annals of surgical oncology,441,1

As COVID-19-related infection and mortality rates in Devon and Cornwall were relatively low, however, urgent elective surgery continued in Plymouth, with the necessary precautions in place. This study aimed to assess outcomes following Ivor Lewis oesophagectomy (ILO) during the pandemic. METHODS We prospectively analysed details of 20 consecutive patients who underwent ILO for cancer over a 3-month period between 17 March and 12 June 2020. All patients underwent COVID-19 swab testing 24-48 hours before surgery and during admission when clinically indicated. The primary outcome measure was COVID-19-related morbidity. Secondary outcome measures were non-COVID-19-related morbidity, mortality and length of hospital stay. RESULTS Twenty patients underwent ILO during the study period. All patients identified as white British. No patients tested positive for COVID-19 pre- or postoperatively. There was no COVID-19-related morbidity. There was no in-hospital mortality. Seven patients developed pneumonia, which settled with antibiotics. One patient developed an anastomotic leak, which was treated conservatively. One patient returned to theatre for a para-conduit hernia repair. The median length of hospital stay was nine days. One patient required admission to the high dependency unit for inotropic support for two days.

METHODS Central adjudication of mild cognitive impairment and probable dementia was based on standardized cognitive test battery scores administered to 3,802 individuals who had been randomly assigned, with equal probability, to either the lifestyle intervention or the diabetes support and education control. When scores fell below a prespecified threshold, functional information was obtained through proxy interview. RESULTS Compared with control, the intensive lifestyle intervention induced and maintained marked differences in weight loss and self-reported physical activity throughout follow-up. At an average (range) of 11.4 (9.5-13.5) years after enrollment, when participants' mean age was 69.6 (54.9-87.2) years, the prevalence of mild cognitive impairment and probable dementia was 6.4% and 1.8%, respectively, in the intervention group, compared with 6.6% and 1.8%, respectively, in the control group (p = 0.93). The lack of an intervention effect on the prevalence of cognitive impairment was consistent among individuals grouped by cardiovascular disease history, diabetes duration, sex, and APOE ε4 allele status (all p ≥ 0.50). However, there was evidence (p = 0.03) that the intervention effect ranged from benefit to harm across participants ordered from lowest to highest baseline BMI.

Safe placement of a PEG tube requires passage of the esophagus and transillumination of the stomach through the abdominal wall. Surgical placement of a PEG tube has been shown to be feasible although the local complication rate ranges above the endoscopic procedure. We are presenting a new technique (percutaneous laparoscopically assisted gastrostomy, PLAG) to provide enteral access for patients with pharyngoesophageal obstruction not suitable for PEG placement. METHODS We have developed a laparoscopic method that allows full control of the stoma location at the anterior gastric wall. The tube has a deployable bumper mechanism, which can be inserted through a minimal gastric incision. Combined with the fixation by transcutaneous sutures, the risk for leakage or dislodgement is low. RESULTS Fifty-one PLAGs were inserted in 45 male and six female patients suffering from pharyngoesophageal obstruction due to malignancy. Patients were referred after unsuccessful endoscopic PEG placement (n = 39) or received their PLAG when they underwent staging laparoscopy (n = 12). Success rate was 96.2%. No procedure-related mortality was observed. Infectious complications occurred in three (5.9%) cases. In five patients, minor leaks were managed conservatively (n = 4) or required relaparoscopy (n = 1) and placement of an additional suture (overall complication rate of 15.8%, n = 8). Nutritional goals were reached after 7.8 ± 2.3 days. CONCLUSION PLAG is a safe and easy procedure. It can well be used to provide enteral access for patients with pharyngoesophageal obstruction not suitable for endoscopic PEG placement.","Bolder, Ulrich; Scherer, Marcus N; Schmidt, Thorsten; Hornung, Matthias; Schlitt, Hans-Jürgen; Vogel, Peter",Langenbeck's archives of surgery,441,26

We investigated the effects of sex and age on pain modulatory networks in a healthy state and during OA progression. We used functional MRI to determine the effects of sex and age on periaqueductal gray functional connectivity (PAG FC) in a healthy state (pre-OA) and during the early and late phases of monosodium iodoacetate-induced OA in rats. We then examined how sex and age affect longitudinal changes in PAG FC in OA. In a healthy state, females exhibited more widespread PAG FC than males, and this effect was exaggerated with aging. Young males had moderate PAG FC changes during the early phase but recruited additional brain regions, including the rostral anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), during the late phase. Young females exhibited widespread PAG FC in the early phase, which includes connections to insula, caudal ACC, and nucleus accumbens (NAc). Older groups had strong PAG FC with fewer regions in the early phase, but they recruited additional brain regions, including NAc, in the late phase. Overall, our findings show that PAG FC is modulated by sex and age in a healthy state. A widespread PAG network in the early phase of OA pain may contribute to the transition from acute to chronic OA pain and the increased risk of developing chronic pain for females.

As the outbreak of a novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is a global pandemic, a real-time social media monitoring is needed to know the scale of this phenomenon. We have reported the frequency, reach and impact of online mentions about the COVID-19 illness taken from social media platforms: Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, blogs, forums, and news portals to highlight and better understand the scope of coronavirus discussion in Poland. We used SentiOne social listening tool to gather the data and perform the monitoring between 24 February 2020 to 25 March 2020. We found a total of 1,415,750 mentions related to COVID-19 which gives the average 47,192 mentions per day. 95.36% (1,350,059) of mentions were people's updates and expressions, 4.64% (65,691) mentions were articles from news portals and social media. Males have dominated the online conversation about COVID-19 (65.32% vs 34.68% females). At the same time, women were more likely to discuss the topic on social media platforms such as: Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram. We concluded with theoretical and practical implications.","Burzyńska, Joanna; Bartosiewicz, Anna; Rękas, Magdalena",Health informatics journal,441,7

This study included 47 patients who underwent laparoscopic right hemicolectomy with intracorporeal mechanical anastomosis and barbed suture enterotomy closure (barbed suture closure-BSC) for adenocarcinoma (with the exception of T4 lesions and metastasis), compared with 47 matched patients who underwent laparoscopic right hemicolectomy with intracorporeal mechanical anastomosis and conventional suture enterotomy closure (conventional suture closure-CSC) during the same period. Controls were matched for stage, age, and gender via a statistically generated selection of all laparoscopic right hemicolectomies performed from January 2009 until December 2015. There was no difference between the two groups in terms of age, sex, BMI, ASA, co-morbidity, previous abdominal surgery, cancer site and cancer staging. In terms of operating time (median 120 min for BSC and 127.5 min for CSC), histopathological results, surgical site complications (2.1% for BSC and 8.5% for CSC), hospitalization (median 6 days for BSC and 5 days for CSC), readmission rate (0%), there were no differences between the groups (p > 0.05). No significant differences were noted between the two groups in terms of the postoperative course.

However, commercial P4HB can only be produced by the bacterial fermentation, which limits its applications in the cerebrospinal system due to higher endotoxin restriction. Meanwhile, P4HB can be prepared via the ring-opening polymerization of γ-butyrolactone. In this contribution, high molecular weight P4HB from chemosynthesis is electrospun into fibrous membrane, showing good mechanical properties that match the natural dura mater. Such P4HB membrane induces fast cellular migration, adhesion, and proliferation of fibroblasts in vitro. Subcutaneous implantation in rats demonstrates excellent biocompatibility of the P4HB membrane with proper biodegradation behaviors. After implantation in the rabbit dural defect model as an onlay graft, the P4HB membranes prevent cerebrospinal fluid leakage and regenerate dura tissue without detecting any local or systematic infections or foreign body responses. Thus, the electrospun P4HB membranes may be particularly useful as artificial dural substitutes to induce wound closure and tissue regeneration, which will be of great benefit to neurosurgery in the future.","Ma, Huihui; Sun, Yilin; Tang, Ying; Shen, Yong; Kan, Ze; Li, Qing; Fang, Sha; Lu, Yingxi; Zhou, Xianfeng; Li, Zhibo",Macromolecular bioscience,441,5

In this scenario, the role of trace metals in the insurgence and progression of atherosclerosis has not been clarified yet. In this paper, the specific role of selected trace elements (magnesium, zinc, selenium, iron, copper, phosphorus, and calcium) is described by focusing on the atherosclerotic prevention and pathogenesis plaque. For each element, the following data are reported: daily intake, serum levels, intra/extracellular distribution, major roles in physiology, main effects of high and low levels, specific roles in atherosclerosis, possible interactions with other trace elements, and possible influences on plaque development. For each trace element, the correlations between its levels and clinical severity and outcome of COVID-19 are discussed. Moreover, the role of matrix metalloproteinases, a family of zinc-dependent endopeptidases, as a new medical therapeutical approach to atherosclerosis is discussed. Data suggest that trace element status may influence both atherosclerosis insurgence and plaque evolution toward a stable or an unstable status. However, significant variability in the action of these traces is evident: some - including magnesium, zinc, and selenium - may have a protective role, whereas others, including iron and copper, probably have a multi-faceted and more complex role in the pathogenesis of the atherosclerotic plaque. Finally, calcium and phosphorus are implicated in the calcification of atherosclerotic plaques and in the progression of the plaque toward rupture and severe clinical complications. In particular, the role of calcium is debated. Focusing on the COVID-19 pandemia, optimized magnesium and zinc levels are indicated as important protective tools against a severe clinical course of the disease, often related to the ability of SARS-CoV-2 to cause a systemic inflammatory response, able to transform a stable plaque into an unstable one, with severe clinical complications.","Fanni, D; Gerosa, C; Nurchi, V M; Suri, J S; Nardi, V; Congiu, T; Coni, P; Ravarino, A; Cerrone, G; Piras, M; Cau, F; Kounis, N G; Balestrieri, A; Gibo, Y; Van Eyken, P; Coghe, F; Venanzi Rullo, E; Taibi, R; Orrù, G; Faa, G; Saba, L",European review for medical and pharmacological sciences,441,1

Using integrative data analysis (IDA), we aggregated data across three studies examining hurricane preparation intentions. Analysis supported two of the potential pathways. Supporting the first path, both openness and extraversion had direct, positive relationships with preparation likelihood. Supporting the second path, agreeableness, conscientiousness, and social conservatism positively related to preparation likelihood through a positive relationship with threat perception, whereas impulsivity and sensation-seeking negatively related to preparation likelihood through a negative relationship with threat perception.

Leadership is the ability to guide a team or organization toward a stated goal or objective. In addition to hospital-wide leadership, there is need for leadership at the level of medical teams. Resident leadership is essential to ensure team function and patient care, yet residents are often overlooked as valuable leaders. This Perspective argues that residents can demonstrate leadership during a public health crisis by creating a culture of emotional intelligence in their medical teams. Emotional intelligence has been identified as a critical aspect of leadership and consists of self-awareness, self-management, social awareness, and relationship management. In psychiatry, patient interactions depend upon psychiatrists demonstrating a high level of attention to their own thoughts, feelings, and behaviors as well as those of the patient to communicate in a way that demonstrates both understanding and empathy. In this Perspective, a psychiatry resident uses expertise in emotional intelligence to recommend residents (1) be mindful, (2) ask and listen, (3) establish safety, and (4) unite around a common goal. These practical recommendations can be immediately implemented to increase emotional intelligence on medical teams to improve team function and patient care. Emotional intelligence is valuable at all levels of leadership, so hospital leadership and program directors should also heed these suggestions. While these recommendations are not unique to COVID-19, they are of paramount importance during the pandemic.","Ward, Heather Burrell",Academic medicine : journal of the Association of American Medical Colleges,441,1

METHODS Electronic databases (Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, Ovid, PubMed, ScienceDirect, Scopus and Wiley InterScience) were searched using a three-step search strategy to identify the relevant quantitative and qualitative studies published in English from 1997 to 2009. The grey literature was not included in the review. The identified studies were evaluated using the Meta-Analysis of Statistics, Assessment and Review Instrument and the Qualitative Assessment and Review Instrument from the Joanna Briggs Institute. Fourteen quantitative studies were included and the findings included in a narrative summary. The findings from the two qualitative studies were categorised into a meta-synthesis that generated two synthesised findings. RESULTS Findings indicated that healthcare workers perceived personal and familial health risks and stigmatisation from their exposure to emerging acute respiratory infectious diseases, but the majority were accepting of these risks. Organisational implementation of infection control measures, avoidance of patients and complying with personal protective equipment were identified as risk-mitigating strategies. Demographic, individual and organisational factors were found to influence their risk perceptions and their adoption of strategies to mitigate the risk. CONCLUSIONS It appears that healthcare workers' risk perceptions can influence their behaviour towards patients with emerging acute respiratory infectious diseases as well as their use of risk-mitigating strategies. Institutions need to ensure that appropriate infection control safeguards are in place to protect workers and their families. Institutions can also offer incentives to encourage healthcare workers to comply with the policies and procedures introduced to mitigate risk. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE Institutions and government need to ensure that policies and procedures are communicated and adequate institutional measures (i.e. personal protective equipment; education and training; and personal support) are implemented to safeguard healthcare workers during and after pandemic outbreaks. IMPLICATIONS FOR RESEARCH Future research needs to examine how perception of risk related to acute emerging respiratory infectious diseases, epidemic or pandemic, and the factors that would influence healthcare workers': decisions to stay within the workforce and provide care or resign from the workforce and compliance with institutional and government policies and procedures, as well as compliance to use of personal protective equipment.","Koh, Yiwen; Hegney, Desley Gail; Drury, Vicki",International journal of evidence-based healthcare,441,9

BACKGROUND Surgical repair of para-oesophageal herniation has been associated with high rates of failure. The utilisation of prosthetic mesh is controversial with complications including erosion and fistulation. Long-term outcomes for biologic mesh crural augmentation are unclear. METHODS A retrospective analysis of patients who underwent a biologic mesh (Permacol) augmented cruroplasty in the repair of large and/or complex para-oesophageal hernia was performed utilising the prospectively maintained oesophago-gastric database at the Royal Devon and Exeter Hospital between October 2004 and January 2013. This technique was selectively used for patients where the lateral extent of the diaphragmatic-crural defect prevented the fashioning of a sound, tension-free repair with sutures alone, or previous surgery had failed. Successful outcome was defined by resolution of symptoms and structural integrity of the repair. RESULTS Fifty one procedures were performed on 49 patients (15 male), median age 75 (range 25-91). Post-operative morbidity included 2 (3.9%) oesophageal injuries managed conservatively, and 2 (3.9%) patients who suffered early repair breakdown requiring immediate surgical re-intervention. Four patients (8%) required endoscopic dilatation due to dysphagia, one (2%) in the early post-operative phase. The median follow-up was 36 months (range 6-105). All patients reported initial symptomatic resolution. Two patients (4%) were demonstrated to have breakdown of their repair during the follow-up period, both of whom underwent revision mesh-augmented surgery and are re-incorporated in this series. Late-onset dysphagia in two (4%) patients may be mesh-related, but no other complications were observed and a Kaplan-Meier analysis of this series predicts a symptom-free rate of approximately 94% at 5 years. CONCLUSIONS The selective integration of biologic mesh to augment the crural repair in para-oesophageal hernia with extensive diaphragmatic defects appears to be safe, effective and infers the potential of long-term satisfactory outcomes.","Travers, H C; Brewer, J O; Smart, N J; Wajed, S A",Hernia : the journal of hernias and abdominal wall surgery,441,28

However, clinical practice and recent literature have suggested new risk factors for multidrug-resistant infection (MRI): the presence of permanent indwelling devices, prior antibiotic use in the last 3 months, chronic and advanced pulmonary diseases (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, bronchiectasis, etc.), history of alcoholism, and immunosuppression. The clinical presentation in HCAP patients is often unusual (mild respiratory symptoms and frequent extrapulmonary manifestations) due to different factors: advanced age, neurological disorders, and multiple chronic comorbidities. Moreover, HCAP commonly presents a worse clinical course than community-acquired pneumonia, a prolonged length of stay, and a mortality rate close to hospital-acquired pneumonia. Chest radiography and routine laboratory markers (including C-reactive protein) are always needed for clinical evaluation and severity assessment. The clinical use of new biomarkers of infection and sepsis (procalcitonin, etc.) is currently being investigated. Extensive microbiological testing to overcome the high prevalence of MRI in HCAP, including urinary antigens for Legionella and Streptococcus pneumoniae; blood cultures; Gram staining and low respiratory tract secretions (sputum, tracheobronchial aspirate, fibrobronchial aspirate, protected specimen brush, bronchoalveolar lavage); and cultures for aerobic, anaerobic, mycobacterial, and fungal pathogens are recommended, whereas the indication for serology tests for respiratory viruses and atypical pathogens is low. By contrast, the new polymerase chain reaction-based techniques for the rapid identification (2 to 4 hours) of microbial pathogens in respiratory samples (nasopharyngeal swab, bronchoalveolar lavage) seem to be the most innovative future perspective in the diagnostics of HCAP.","Polverino, Eva; Torres, Antoni",Seminars in respiratory and critical care medicine,441,31

Point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) is useful in evaluation of dyspneic patients. In prior studies, POCUS is often performed by ultrasound (US) teams without patient care responsibilities. OBJECTIVES This study evaluates the effectiveness of POCUS in narrowing diagnostic uncertainty in dyspneic patients when performed by treating EPs vs. separate US teams. METHODS This multicenter, prospective noninferiority cohort study investigated the effect of a POCUS performing team in patient encounters for dyspnea. Before-and-after surveys assessing medical decision-making were administered to attending physicians. Primary outcome was change in most likely diagnosis after POCUS. This was assessed for noninferiority between encounters where the primary or US team performed POCUS. Secondary outcomes included change in differential diagnosis, confidence in diagnosis, interventions considered, and image quality. RESULTS There were 156 patient encounters analyzed. In the primary team group, most likely diagnosis changed in 40% (95% confidence interval 28-52%) of encounters vs. 32% (95% confidence interval 22-41%) in the US team group. This was noninferior using an a priori specified margin of 20% (p < .0001). Post-POCUS differential decreased by a mean 1.8 diagnoses and was equivalent within a margin of 0.5 diagnoses between performing teams (p = 0.034). Other outcomes were similar between groups. CONCLUSION POCUS performed by primary teams was noninferior to POCUS performed by US teams for changing the most likely diagnosis, and equivalent when considering mean reduction in number of diagnoses.

Do the sweat glands maximum ion reabsorption rates increase following heat acclimation in healthy older individuals and is this associated with elevated aldosterone concentrations? What is the main finding and its importance? Sweat glands maximum ion reabsorption rates improved heterogeneously across body sites, which occurred without any changes in aldosterone concentration following a controlled hyperthermic heat acclimation protocol in healthy older individuals. ABSTRACT We examined whether the eccrine sweat glands ion reabsorption rates improved following heat acclimation (HA) in older individuals. Ten healthy older adults (>65 yrs) completed a controlled hyperthermic (+0.9˚C rectal temperature, Tre ) HA protocol for 9 non-consecutive days. Participants completed a passive heat stress test (lower leg 42˚C water submersion) pre-HA and post-HA to assess physiological regulation of sweat glands ions reabsorption at the chest, forearm and thigh. The maximum ion reabsorption rate was defined as the inflection point in the slope of the relation between galvanic skin conductance and sweat rate (SR). We explored the responses again after a 7-day decay. During passive heating, the Tb thresholds for sweat onset on the chest and forearm were lowered after HA (P < 0.05). However, neither sweat sensitivity (i.e. the slope), the SR at a given Tre , nor gross sweat loss improved after HA (P > 0.05). Any changes observed were lost during the decay. Pilocarpine-induced sudomotor responses to iontophoresis did not change after HA (P ≥ 0.801). Maximum ion reabsorption rate was only enhanced at the chest (P = 0.001) despite unaltered aldosterone concentration after HA. The data suggests that this adaptation is lost after 7-days decay. The HA protocol employed in the present study induced partial adaptive sudomotor responses. Eccrine sweat glands ion reabsorption rates improved heterogeneously across the skin sites. It is likely that aldosterone secretion did not alter the chest sweat ion reabsorption rates observed in the older adults. This article is protected by copyright.

Specifically, short-interval intracortical inhibition and intracortical facilitation are altered following a session of cycling, suggesting that exercise affects the excitability of varied cortical circuits. Yet we do not know whether a session of exercise also impacts the excitability of interhemispheric circuits between, and other intracortical circuits within, M1. Here we present two experiments designed to address this gap in knowledge. In experiment 1, single and paired pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) were used to measure intracortical circuits including, short-interval intracortical facilitation (SICF) tested at 1.1, 1.5, 2.7, 3.1 and 4.5 ms interstimulus intervals (ISIs), contralateral silent period (CSP) and interhemispheric interactions by measuring transcallosal inhibition (TCI) recorded from the abductor pollicus brevis muscles. All circuits were assessed bilaterally pre and two time points post (immediately, 30 min) moderate intensity lower limb cycling. SICF was enhanced in the left hemisphere after exercise at the 1.5 ms ISI. Also, CSP was shortened and TCI decreased bilaterally after exercise. In Experiment 2, corticospinal and spinal excitability were tested before and after exercise to investigate the locus of the effects found in Experiment 1. Exercise did not impact motor-evoked potential recruitment curves, Hoffman reflex or V-wave amplitudes. These results suggest that a session of exercise decreases intracortical and interhemispheric inhibition and increases facilitation in multiple circuits within M1, without concurrently altering spinal excitability. These findings have implications for developing exercise strategies designed to potentiate M1 plasticity and skill learning in healthy and clinical populations.","Neva, J L; Brown, K E; Mang, C S; Francisco, B A; Boyd, L A",The European journal of neuroscience,441,1

It has been reported that the serum levels of prolactin (PRL), follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), and luteinizing hormone (LH) of SARS patients are significantly higher than those of control groups, while estradiol (E2), pregnancy hormone (P), and thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) are considerably lower than those of normal controls. This phenomenon suggests that the adenohypophyseal endocrine cells in SARS patients may be damaged. However, up to now there has been no direct histological investigation on the endocrine cells of patients' pituitary. Here we investigated the endocrine cells in the adenohypophysis obtained from autopsies of 5 SARS patients. The immunohistochemistry and quantitative image results showed that compared with control cases, both the number of positive cells and the staining intensity of immunoreactivity for growth hormone, TSH, and adrenocorticotrophic hormone in these cells were remarkably decreased, while that of PRL, FSH, and LH were significantly increased in all SARS cases studied. These findings indicated that alterations occurred in the patients' adenohypophyseal endocrine cells, and these changes were consistent with the serum levels of relevant endocrine hormones reported previously. It appears that changes in these endocrine cells and their hormones are affected by the severity of this new infectious disease.","Wei, Lan; Sun, Shen; Zhang, Jing; Zhu, Hong; Xu, Yun; Ma, Qiang; McNutt, Michael A; Korteweg, Christine; Gu, Jiang",Biochemistry and cell biology = Biochimie et biologie cellulaire,441,1

The Achalasia Symptom Questionnaire (ASQ), a structured 11-question survey (score: 0-best, 67-worst), was completed by all consenting patients. ASQ scores, esophago-gastro-duodenoscopy and upper gastro-intestinal (UGI) contrast study findings were compared between patents with subsequently confirmed achalasia and those in whom achalasia was excluded by EM. Univariate logistic regression identified predictors that were tested by multivariate logistic regression to generate the model. Of the 803 EM performed over this 12-month period, 95 patients were referred specifically to assess functional dysphagia. Of these, 50 were confirmed to have achalasia, and 45 had dysphagia without manometric evidence for achalasia and hence comprised the control group. ASQ scores were higher in achalasia patients (37+/-13 versus 23+/-10). Endoscopy and/or contrast esophagogram reports were available in 92% achalasia patients and 80% controls. Significant predictors for achalasia identified on univariate logistic regression included ASQ score, abnormal findings on endoscopy, and contrast UGI study. Using multivariate logistic regression, we were able to accurately predict the probability of achalasia to be P where P=ey/(1+ey) and y=5.6+(0.089xASQ)+(2.088xEGD)+(3.083xUGI), e=exponential constant 2.7182, esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) and UGI=0 if normal and 1 if abnormal. Dropping the predictor ASQ, the formula changes to y=-2.7+(1.987xEGD)+(2.861xUGI). Using only noninvasive investigations (i.e. eliminating EGD), the formula changes to y=-4.9653+(0.0951xASQ)+(3.4312xUGI). The probability of achalasia can be calculated in patients with functional dysphagia based on clinical, endoscopic, and radiographic findings allowing for a prioritization of EM studies.","Ferri, L E; Cools-Lartigue, J; Cao, J; Miller, L; Mayrand, S; Fried, G M; Darling, G",Diseases of the esophagus : official journal of the International Society for Diseases of the Esophagus,441,5

ANIMALS 15 healthy German Shepherd Dogs. PROCEDURES :Sevoflurane MAC was determined by use of tail clamping. Entropy indices consisting of response entropy and state entropy were recorded during MAC determination. Optimal cutoff points of response entropy and state entropy for use in predicting responses to tail clamping were analyzed with multiple logistic regression. RESULTS Sevoflurane MAC ranged from 1.8% to 2.6% (mean ± SD, 2.2 ± 0.3%). Response entropy and state entropy were significantly higher during positive responses to tail clamping (88 ± 2 and 76 ± 2, respectively) than during negative responses to tail clamping (63 ± 3 and 52 ± 3, respectively). The difference between the 2 entropy indices did not differ between positive (11 ± 1) and negative (13 ± 1) responses to tail clamping. Response entropy and state entropy served as independent predictors of a positive response, with areas under the curve for receiver operating characteristic curves 0.810 (95% confidence interval, 0.716 to 0.903) and 0.828 (95% confidence interval, 0.741 to 0.916), respectively. Optimal cutoff points to predict a positive response were 75 for response entropy and 65 for state entropy, which corresponded to mean ± SD ORs of 25.2 ± 15.6 and 14.9 ± 7.9, respectively. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE Response entropy and state entropy were good predictors of responses to tail clamping elicited during determination of sevoflurane MAC in healthy dogs.","Mahidol, Chulabhorn; Thengchaisri, Naris",American journal of veterinary research,441,19

Twenty-four cats were included in a prospective, blinded clinical trial. Cats were equally divided into minimal (minimal dental treatment) or severe (multiple dental extractions) oral disease groups. They were admitted (day 0) and underwent oral examination/radiographs/treatment under general anesthesia (day 1; acepromazine-hydromorphone-propofol-isoflurane-meloxicam-local anesthetic blocks). Serum inflammatory cytokines were measured on days 0 and 6. Pain was scored using the Glasgow composite measure pain scale-feline (CMPS-F). Rescue analgesia was administered with hydromorphone if CMPS-F ≥ 5/20. Dry and soft food intake (%) during 3 minutes and 2 hours, and daily soft food were calculated. The Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel and Chi-square tests, Spearman's rank correlation and linear mixed models were used for statistical analysis (alpha = 0.05). Pain scores were significantly increased in cats with severe disease when compared with baseline (up to day 4) and minimal disease (all postoperative time points). Prevalence of rescue analgesia was significantly higher in severe (91.7%) than minimal disease (0%); analgesics were required up to day 3. Pain scores and frequency of rescue analgesia were significantly correlated with the number of tooth extractions, gingival and calculus index. Prevalence of rescue analgesia was significantly correlated with the number of missing teeth, teeth extractions and gingival index. Dry and soft food intake during 3 minutes, and dry food intake during 2 hours were significantly lower in the severe than minimal disease group throughout the study. Some cytokines differed between groups between day 0 and day 6 and were associated with the presence of tooth resorption and number of missing tooth and tooth fractures. Long-term analgesia is required after dental extractions in cats with severe oral disease. This condition reduces food intake and influences serum inflammatory cytokines.","Watanabe, Ryota; Doodnaught, Graeme; Proulx, Caroline; Auger, Jean-Philippe; Monteiro, Beatriz; Dumais, Yvan; Beauchamp, Guy; Segura, Mariela; Steagall, Paulo",PloS one,441,33

STUDY DESIGN This was a retrospective cohort study. To estimate the cumulative live birth rate we only included couples who had used all embryos from their initial stimulation or achieved a live birth. We constructed a logistic regression model using live birth as a dependent variable and age group, duration of infertility, primary vs. secondary infertility, insemination method, cause of infertility, Anti-Mullerian Hormone (AMH), Follicle Stimulating Hormone (FSH) and antral follicle count (AFC) as our independent variables and used a backward elimination method to create the best fitting regression models to predict the probability of a cumulative live birth (p < 0.05 for elimination). RESULTS There were 516 complete cycles of ovarian stimulation resulting in 357 livebirths giving a cumulative livebirth rate of 69.2 % (95 % CI 66.0-74.0). Women with a live birth had significantly lower median age (34 years [IQR 31-37] vs. 36 years [IQR 33-39], p = 0.01) and FSH (6.7 iu/L [IQR 5.8-7.9] vs. 7.4 iu/L [IQR 6.2-8.6] and a significantly higher median AMH (22.1 pmol/L [IQR 12.1-30.9] vs. 10.5 pmol/L [IQR 7.3-20.7], p = 0.01) and AFC (18 [IQR 12-26] vs. 12 [IQR 9-19], p = 0.01). The backward conditional logistic regression model retained age category, FSH category and AMH category as significant independent predictors. The area under the curve for this model was 0.68 (95 % CI 0.63 - 0.73). CONCLUSION Our prediction model estimates a couple's individualised probability of achieving a live birth after their first complete cycle of IVF using all known pre-treatment predictors. LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION The study population were only those eligible for NHS funded IVF treatment which have strict ovarian reserve criteria. Exclusion of those with very low egg reserve is likely to influence the predictive capacity of out model. Furthermore, our model was developed using cycle data from one unit and thus its predictive capacity has not been assessed on an independent cohort of women. We therefore welcome external geographical validation of our model prior to its use in clinical practice.","Balachandren, N; Salman, M; Diu, N L; Schwab, S; Rajah, K; Mavrelos, D","European journal of obstetrics, gynecology, and reproductive biology",441,1

Coupled with its preventable nature, these adverse sequelae make delirium a significant public health concern; understanding its economic costs is important for policy makers and health care leaders to prioritize care. Objective To evaluate current 1-year health care costs attributable to postoperative delirium in older patients undergoing elective surgery. Design, Setting, and Participants This prospective cohort study included 497 patients from the Successful Aging after Elective Surgery (SAGES) study, an ongoing cohort study of older adults undergoing major elective surgery. Patients were enrolled from June 18, 2010, to August 8, 2013. Eligible patients were 70 years or older, English-speaking, able to communicate verbally, and scheduled to undergo major surgery at 1 of 2 Harvard-affiliated hospitals with an anticipated length of stay of at least 3 days. Eligible surgical procedures included total hip or knee replacement; lumbar, cervical, or sacral laminectomy; lower extremity arterial bypass surgery; open abdominal aortic aneurysm repair; and open or laparoscopic colectomy. Data were analyzed from October 15, 2019, to September 15, 2020. Exposures Major elective surgery and hospitalization. Main Outcomes and Measures Cumulative and period-specific costs (index hospitalization, 30-day, 90-day, and 1-year follow-up) were examined using Medicare claims and extensive clinical data. Total inflation-adjusted health care costs were determined using data from Medicare administrative claims files for the 2010 to 2014 period. Delirium was rated using the Confusion Assessment Method. We also examined whether increasing delirium severity was associated with higher cumulative and period-specific costs. Delirium severity was measured with the Confusion Assessment Method-Severity long form. Regression models were used to determine costs associated with delirium after adjusting for patient demographic and clinical characteristics. Results Of the 566 patients who were eligible for the study, a total of 497 patients (mean [SD] age, 76.8 [5.1] years; 281 women [57%]; 461 White participants [93%]) were enrolled after exclusion criteria were applied. During the index hospitalization, 122 patients (25%) developed postoperative delirium, whereas 375 (75%) did not. Patients with delirium had significantly higher unadjusted health care costs than patients without delirium (mean [SD] cost, $146 358 [$140 469] vs $94 609 [$80 648]). After adjusting for relevant confounders, the cumulative health care costs attributable to delirium were $44 291 (95% CI, $34 554-$56 673) per patient per year, with the majority of costs coming from the first 90 days: index hospitalization ($20 327), subsequent rehospitalizations ($27 797), and postacute rehabilitation stays ($2803). Health care costs increased directly and significantly with level of delirium severity (none-mild, $83 534; moderate, $99 756; severe, $140 008), suggesting an exposure-response relationship. The adjusted mean cumulative costs attributable to severe delirium were $56 474 (95% CI, $40 927-$77 440) per patient per year. Extrapolating nationally, the health care costs attributable to postoperative delirium were estimated at $32.9 billion (95% CI, $25.7 billion-$42.2 billion) per year. Conclusions and Relevance These findings suggest that the economic outcomes of delirium and severe delirium after elective surgery are substantial, rivaling costs associated with cardiovascular disease and diabetes. These results highlight the need for policy imperatives to address delirium as a large-scale public health issue.","Gou, Ray Yun; Hshieh, Tammy T; Marcantonio, Edward R; Cooper, Zara; Jones, Richard N; Travison, Thomas G; Fong, Tamara G; Abdeen, Ayesha; Lange, Jeffrey; Earp, Brandon; Schmitt, Eva M; Leslie, Douglas L; Inouye, Sharon K",JAMA surgery,441,12

We investigated the prevalence of disability and areas of life affected by disability among elders of the public primary health care in São Paulo and Manaus, Brazil. We investigated whether people with disability visited a primary care professional more frequently, the individual characteristics associated with disability, and differences by city. We randomly selected participants aged ≥60 years (n = 1375). The main outcome was disability, evaluated with the 12-item World Health Organization Disability Assessment Schedule (WHODAS 2.0). Exposure variables were consultation with a family physician, sociodemographic characteristics, health status, social support, and lifestyle. The prevalence of global disability was higher in Manaus (66.2% vs. 56.4% in São Paulo). In both cities, participation and mobility were the areas of life most affected by disability. The number of consultations with a family physician was not associated with disability. The high prevalence of disability and associated risk factors indicates that public primary health care is not meeting the needs of elders in both cities. It is warning because most elders in LMICs live in more underserved communities compared to Brazil.","Montoro Pazzini Watfe, Giovana; Fajersztajn, Lais; Ribeiro, Euler; Rossi Menezes, Paulo; Scazufca, Marcia",Life,441,31

The mechanisms underlying cerebral endothelial susceptibility and response to SARS-CoV-2 are unknown yet critical to understanding the association of SARS-CoV-2 infection with cerebrovascular events. METHODS Endothelial cells were isolated from human brain and analyzed by RNA sequencing. Human umbilical vein and human brain microvascular cells were used in both monolayer culture and endothelialized within a 3-dimensional printed vascular model of the middle cerebral artery. Gene expression levels were measured by quantitative polymerase chain reaction and direct RNA hybridization. Recombinant SARS-CoV-2 S protein and S protein-containing liposomes were used to measure endothelial binding by immunocytochemistry. RESULTS ACE2 (angiotensin-converting enzyme-2) mRNA levels were low in human brain and monolayer endothelial cell culture. Within the 3-dimensional printed vascular model, ACE2 gene expression and protein levels were progressively increased by vessel size and flow rates. SARS-CoV-2 S protein-containing liposomes were detected in human umbilical vein endothelial cells and human brain microvascular endothelial cells in 3-dimensional middle cerebral artery models but not in monolayer culture consistent with flow dependency of ACE2 expression. Binding of SARS-CoV-2 S protein triggered 83 unique genes in human brain endothelial cells including upregulation of complement component C3. CONCLUSIONS Brain endothelial cells are susceptible to direct SARS-CoV-2 infection through flow-dependent expression of ACE2. Viral S protein binding triggers a unique gene expression profile in brain endothelia that may explain the association of SARS-CoV-2 infection with cerebrovascular events.","Kaneko, Naoki; Satta, Sandro; Komuro, Yutaro; Muthukrishnan, Sree Deepthi; Kakarla, Visesha; Guo, Lea; An, Jennifer; Elahi, Fanny; Kornblum, Harley I; Liebeskind, David S; Hsiai, Tzung; Hinman, Jason D",Stroke,441,17

Clinical cure was defined as the resolution of symptoms by day 10 post-treatment. Microbiological eradication was assessed with stool enzyme immunoassay for G.duodenalis antigen on day 7-10 post-treatment. RESULTS The study was terminated due to the extremely slow enrollment. We describe the outcome for six patients treated with rectal metronidazole and one patient treated with oral tinidazole. All symptomatic patients (4/4) were clinically cured with rectal metronidazole. Microbiological eradication was successful after the first treatment course in all tested patients (6/6), of whom five were treated with rectal metronidazole and one with oral tinidazole. Side effects were reported in one patient and were restricted to a single episode of loose stool after the third dose of rectal metronidazole. The majority of caregivers (4/6) considered the administration of rectal metronidazole relatively easy.

Following the findings of recent epidemiological studies and the finding of gadolinium (Gd) in the skin tissue of NSF patients, it is now definitely known that the use of Gd contrast agents can trigger NSF. To date, however, the exact mechanism underlying the induction of fibrosis in various organs by Gd remains unexplained. This study was undertaken to evaluate the influence of Gd on the proliferation activity and collagen production of cultured fibroblasts. Normal human dermis-derived fibroblasts were incubated in the presence of gadodiamide (GA) in the concentration range of 5 × 10-7 to 5 × 10-3 M. The proliferation activity of the cells was assessed on the basis of the cell counts in the fibroblast growth curve and the DNA-synthetic activity of the cells (indicator; level of 3H-thymidine uptake by cells). The collagen production was evaluated by densitometric measurement of the quantity of collagen through electrophoresis and fluorography after incorporation of 3H-proline into the procollagens. Furthermore, the expression levels of the genes for type I and III collagen were measured by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay. The cell count tended to be higher when the fibroblasts were incubated in medium containing GA in the concentration range of 5 × 10-7 to 5 × 10-4M as compared to that in the GA-free control cultures; furthermore, the DNA-synthetic activity also rose in a concentration-dependent manner in the GA-treated group as compared to that in the control group. No significant changes in either the collagen production or the collagen gene expression levels were noted in cultures containing GA at concentrations between 5 × 10-7 and 5 × 10-3 M. These results suggest that the formation of sclerosing lesions in patients with NSF may be attributable to the effect of GA of enhancing the growth activity of fibroblasts.","Ozawa, Yumi; Hayashi, Shujiro; Hamasaki, Yoichiro; Hatamochi, Atsushi",Archives of dermatological research,441,8

The association between severe COVID-19 and tobacco use is still debated. The aim of this paper is to enhance the importance of providing up to date informations about nicotine and tobacco use in connection with the SARS-CoV-2-related conditions. METHODS We present 3 cases of sudden tobacco use cessation in 3 long-term heavy smokers receiving mental health care for chronic psychotic disorders. Fear of severe form of COVID-19 was their principal motivation. Nicotine replacement therapy and quitline counseling were provided and no major withdrawal symptoms were declared. RESULTS As mass media later wrongly presented tobacco use as a protective factor regarding COVID-19, all three patients resumed smoking. Rigorous counseling took advantage of psychotic symptoms to correct false informations and finally promote tobacco use cessation. CONCLUSIONS The COVID-19 pandemic might paradoxically represent a great motivational factor to quit smoking, espacially when considering patients suffering from severe mental health disorders. Beyond the terrible suffering it causes, we illustrate with a case serie that this opportunity must be exploited by mental health professionals to improve quality and life expectancy of their patients.","Theuerkauff, Olivier; Hanak, Catherine",Psychiatria Danubina,441,26

Cumulative incidence of recurrence and death were analyzed using a competing risk model. RESULTS Age was higher in the Asian group: 66.5 versus 60.1 years (p < 0.0001). The most common etiology was hepatitis B in the Asian group (48.0 %) and alcohol-induced cirrhosis in Europeans (54.4 %); p < 0.001. Asian patients had less advanced disease: 35.5, 55.0, and 3.0 %, respectively, had BCLC 0, A, and B versus 21.5, 58.2, and 15.2 % in the European group (p = 0.01). The cumulative incidences of recurrence in the Asian group at 1, 2, 3, and 5 years were 37.0, 56.4, 62.3, and 67.7 %, respectively, compared to 32.6, 47.2, 49.7, and 53.4 % in the European group (p = 0.474). At 1, 2, 3, and 5 years, the cumulative incidence rates of death in the Asian group were 2.0, 3.9, 4.9, and 4.9 %, respectively, corresponding to 7.7, 9.2, 14.1, and 21.0 % in the European group (p = 0.155). CONCLUSION Similar short-term treatment outcomes are achieved with RFA in HCC patients in the South-East Asian and Northern-European populations. Midterm recurrence and death rates differ between the groups as a result of differences in baseline patient characteristics and patient selection. Our study provides insight relevant to the design of future international studies.","Burgmans, Mark Christiaan; Too, Chow Wei; Fiocco, Marta; Kerbert, Annarein J C; Lo, Richard Hoau Gong; Schaapman, Jelte J; van Erkel, Arian R; Coenraad, Minneke J; Tan, Bien Soo",Cardiovascular and interventional radiology,441,9

A single large translatable frame of 4.3 kb starting at 8.2 kb from the 3' end of the genome was identified. Its deduced amino acid sequence contains the characteristic features of a coronavirus peplomer protein: the precursor polypeptide of TGEV E2 is 1447 residues long (i.e. 285 longer than the avian infectious bronchitis coronavirus spike protein); partial N-terminal sequencing demonstrated that a putative secretory signal sequence of 16 amino acids is absent in the virion-associated protein; the predicted mol. wt. of the apoprotein is 158K; most of the 32 potential N-glycosylation sites available in the sequence are presumed to be functional to account for the difference between this and the experimentally determined value (200K to 220K); a typical hydrophobic sequence near the C terminus is likely to be responsible for anchoring the peplomer to the virion envelope.,"Rasschaert, D; Laude, H",The Journal of general virology,441,1

MATERIAL AND METHODS Online questionnaire survey on the sample of 3,000 respondents aged 15+ randomly selected from the Czech internet panel using socio-demographic quotas was performed shortly after the end of confinement measures in May 2020 (response rate 35.4%). Questions covered current prevalence and patterns of substance use (i.e. in the last 12 months) and other forms of addictive behaviours as well as changes in their behaviour during the confinement measures. Responses were provided on categorical scale; a factor of 0 to 2 was assigned to the categories to quantify the changes where 1 means no change. RESULTS Respondents reporting the highest frequency of current use, especially the use of alcohol, cannabis and sedatives, further increased their intensity of use during the confinement measures by 5-10% on average, while less frequent users reduced it. The reduction of use during confinement measures increased with decreasing frequency of current use. Although the same correlation exists in tobacco smokers, decrease in intensity of use was observed also in daily smokers. On the population level, our results suggest a slight increase in total alcohol and sedatives consumption and a significant increase in the total consumption of gaming and social media. On the contrary, there was a significant reduction in the consumption of tobacco and online gambling (likely due to the ban on sports matches), and a slight reduction in the consumption of cannabis and other illicit drugs. CONCLUSION People with intensive patterns of substance use increased their use during confinement measures. The same concerns gaming and social media. Without this insight the overall picture suggests rather overall reduction of consumption. Addiction treatment system should prepare for the increase of treatment demand following COVID-19 epidemic.","Mravčík, V; Chomynová, P","Epidemiologie, mikrobiologie, imunologie : casopis Spolecnosti pro epidemiologii a mikrobiologii Ceske lekarske spolecnosti J.E.

The homologies of the nucleotide sequences of IFN-gamma, IL-1beta, IL-6, IL-8 and TNF-alpha of the ferret to those from other mammalian species ranged from 64.3-92.9%, 73.0-83.9, 58.1-84.8%, 58.1-89.7% and 79.0-95.0%, respectively. As distinctive amino acid residues constituting various motifs and ligand-binding sites and cysteine residues were highly conserved in ferret inflammatory cytokine proteins, ferret cytokines may have fundamentally similar functions to those of other mammals. Phylogenetic analyses based on the deduced amino acid sequences revealed that all ferret inflammatory cytokines were more closely related to those of the Carnivora order, specifically dog and cat, than to other species.","Nakata, Makoto; Itou, Takuya; Sakai, Takeo",The Journal of veterinary medical science,441,9

Results of serology did not consistently correlate with shedding of virus, and the capture antigen used for detection of feline coronavirus-specific antibodies had a significant impact on results. Testing of samples from one population over a 1-yr period indicated chronic infection in some animals. These relatively healthy carrier animals were a source of virus for contact animals.

We assessed the impact of A. phagocytophilum infection in NB4 promyelocytic leukemic cells using high-density oligoarray, two-dimensional differential gel electrophoresis and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. Our Affymetrix data revealed that A. phagocytophilum altered the expression of transcription factors, cell adhesion molecules, signal transduction genes, and proinflammatory cytokines. However, the expression of Toll-like receptors, MYD88, RNF36, IRF3, and TBK1 and inhibitors of the NF-kappaB gene was not altered. A. phagocytophilum infection also altered the apoptotic program of NB4 cells and resulted in increased transcription of antiapoptotic genes (MCL1 and BFL1). The transcription and translation of iron-metabolism genes (light polypeptide ferritin chain, transferrin, and the transferrin receptor) were significantly altered, suggesting a possible link between A. phagocytophilum infection and iron metabolism.

It has been shown previously that N-specific CD4+ T cells can confer protection against acute disease upon transfer to otherwise lethally infected rats. To define the major antigenic regions that elicit this T cell response, truncated fragments of N protein were expressed from a bacterial expression vector and employed as T cell antigens. Lymphocytes from either MHV-JHM-infected or immunized rats were stimulated in culture with virus antigen, grown and tested for their specificity to the N protein fragments. The carboxy-terminally located C4-N fragment (95 amino acids) induced the most pronounced proliferative response irrespective of whether the lymphocyte culture was derived from immunized or MHV-JHM-infected rats. We established T cell lines specific for the truncated N protein fragments and tested their potential to mediate protection by transfer experiments. Only the T cell line C4-N and the T cell line specific for the full-length N protein were protective. By contrast, all truncated N protein fragments elicited a humoral immune response and contained antigenic sites recognized by antibodies from diseased rats.","Wege, H; Schliephake, A; Körner, H; Flory, E; Wege, H",The Journal of general virology,441,28

All ns proteins were associated with large cytoplasmic vacuoles (CPV), the inner surfaces of which were covered by small invaginations, or spherules, typical of alphavirus infection. All ns proteins were localized by immuno-electron microscopy (EM) to the limiting membranes of CPV and to the spherules, together with newly labeled viral RNA. Along with earlier observations by EM-autoradiography (P. M. Grimley, I. K. Berezesky, and R. M. Friedman, J. Virol. 2:326-338, 1968), these results suggest that individual spherules represent template-associated RNA polymerase complexes. Immunoprecipitation of radiolabeled ns proteins showed that each antiserum precipitated the other three ns proteins, implying that they functioned as a complex. Double labeling with organelle-specific and anti-ns-protein antisera showed that CPV were derivatives of late endosomes and lysosomes. Indeed, CPV frequently contained endocytosed bovine serum albumin-coated gold particles, introduced into the medium at different times after infection. With time, increasing numbers of spherules were also observed on the cell surfaces; they were occasionally released into the medium, probably by secretory lysosomes. We suggest that the spherules arise by primary assembly of the RNA replication complexes at the plasma membrane, guided there by nsP1, which has affinity to lipids specific for the cytoplasmic leaflet of the plasma membrane. Endosomal recycling and fusion of CPV with the plasma membrane can circulate spherules between the plasma membrane and the endosomal-lysosomal compartment.","Kujala, P; Ikäheimonen, A; Ehsani, N; Vihinen, H; Auvinen, P; Kääriäinen, L",Journal of virology,441,26

Failure in its proper operations can seriously impact regional economic development, which is why it is important to evaluate network robustness. Previous analyses of robustness have mainly been conducted with an unweighted approach. In the development of air transport, however, the demand for route configuration has gradually decreased, while the demand for flight adjustments has increased. Consequently, the aviation network has developed unevenly, so adhering to a uniform approach for evaluating network robustness may lead to inaccurate results. Therefore, we examined which centrality sequence is the most sensitive to network robustness in both unweighted and weighted approaches. The air transport network selected for the case study comprised the six subregions of the Eurasian landmass of the Belt and Road region. The study results showed the following: (a) in the network constructed as an unweighted one, betweenness, and degree centrality had higher priorities in preserving network functionalities than eigenvector and closeness centrality;(b) in the network constructed as a weighted one, recursive power had a higher priority in preserving network functionalities than recursive centrality;and (c) no particular centrality measurement had a significant advantage in representing the totality of robustness. The betweenness centrality sequence was sensitive to the average shortest path length and global efficiency;the recursive power sequence was sensitive to the clustering coefficient, while degree centrality was sensitive to graph diversity.

However, the mental health challenges and complexities faced by hospital staff in the United States has not been fully elucidated. To address this gap, we conducted this study to examine the prevalence and correlates of depression and anxiety among hospital staff in light of the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: The design is a single-center, cross-sectional, online survey evaluating depression and anxiety among all hospital employees (n = 3,500) at a safety-net hospital with a moderate cumulative COVID-19 hospitalization rate between April 30-May 22, 2020. We assessed depression with the Patient Health Questionnaire-9. Anxiety was measured with the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 scale. Logistic regression analyses were calculated to identify associations with depression and anxiety. RESULTS: Of 3,500 hospital employees, 1,246 (36%) responded to the survey. We included 1,232 individuals in the final analysis. Overall, psychological distress was common among the respondents: 21% and 33% of staff reported significant depression and anxiety, respectively, while 46% experienced overwhelming stress due to COVID-19. Notably, staff members overwhelmed by the stress of COVID-19 were seven and nine times more likely to suffer from depression and anxiety, respectively. In addition to stress, individuals with six to nine years of work experience were two times more likely to report moderate or severe depression compared to those with 10 or more years of work experience. Moreover, ancillary staff with direct patient contact (odds ratio [OR] 8.9, confidence interval (CI), 1.46, 173.03) as well as administrative and ancillary staff with indirect patient contact (OR 5.9, CI, 1.06, 111.01) were more likely to be depressed than physicians and advanced providers. CONCLUSION: We found that a considerable proportion of staff were suffering from psychological distress. COVID-19-associated depression and anxiety was widespread among hospital staff even in settings with comparatively lower COVID-19 hospitalization rates. Ancillary staff, administrative staff, staff with less job experience, and staff overwhelmed by the stress of COVID-19 are particularly susceptible to negative mental health outcomes. These findings will help inform hospital policymakers on best practices to develop interventions to reduce the mental health burden associated with COVID-19 in vulnerable hospital staff.","Hassamal, Sameer; Dong, Fanglong; Hassamal, Sunita; Lee, Carol; Ogunyemi, Dotun; Neeki, Michael M",West J Emerg Med,441,29

The IgA detected by the ELISA assay might be a more reliable and stable early serological marker than IgM. Instead, IgGs, as expected, showed stable level after 10 days from symptoms onset. CONCLUSION: The ECLIA method could be used as screening test, considering both the excellent performance and the cost per single test; while ELISA assay for IgG and IgA, which are present at a higher level than IgM and last longer, might be used as confirmatory test.","Pieri, Massimo; Ciotti, Marco; Carlozzi, Nicoletta; Frassanito, Maria Loredana; Meloni, Arianna; Cistera, Alessandro; Turchetti, Giordano; Niscola, Silvia; Labate, Giuseppe; Calugi, Graziella; Bernardini, Sergio",Clin Chim Acta,441,21

New telerehabilitation (TR) technologies make it possible to supervise and communicate with exercising participants through videoconferencing equipment. This technology has been shown to be both feasible and effective in Danish chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patients in terms of basic mobility, safety, social interactions and patient perception. This study sought to examine whether it was feasible to carry out TR through home exercises in groups. METHODS: Both medical and hip-fracture home-dwelling patients aged 65 years and older admitted to the Emergency Department (ED) and Department of Geriatrics for acute reasons were asked to participate in the study just before their discharge. The inclusion criteria were normal cognitive function, being dependent on a walking aid and computer users before hospitalisation. RESULTS: At discharge, 333 patients were consecutively screened for participation. Of those, 300 patients were excluded. Thirty-three patients met the inclusion criteria. They had a mean age of 82.3 years (± 7.8) and 76% were women. Nine patients agreed to participate, but seven withdrew. The most frequent explanation was exhaustion in the continuation of hospitalisation. CONCLUSION: It was not possible to conduct a videoconference TR study in a geriatric population, as many were excluded and those who were eligible withdrew after inclusion. During the COVID-19 pandemic, TR may be an important tool for isolated older persons to hinder functional decline. Aspects such as recruitment procedures and IT solutions designed for older people must be considered.","Jørgensen, Bodil B; Gregersen, Merete; Pallesen, Søren Holm; Damsgaard, Else Marie",,441,16

The World Health Organization declared COVID-19 as a pandemic since its emergence from China. The RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (nsp-12) is a complex with nsp-7 and nsp-8 cofactors and is a major constituent of viral replication and RNA synthesis machinery. In the current study, the RdRp of the virus was selected as a receptor protein for computational drug discovery. Computational homology modelling was done in order to find the hidden secondary structures and structural assessment of the viral protein to target them via antiviral drugs. The study was based on molecular docking of different phytochemicals to check their potentials against viral replicative proteins. Out of 200 ligands used in this study from different plants, the best ten were selected based on drug discovery parameters such as S-score, ligand interactions, hydrophobic interactions and druglikeness. The ten best selected ligands were found to be verbenalin, epigallocatechin, swertisin, nobiletin, pinoresinol, caftaric acid, hesperetin, islandicin, neochlorogenic acid and sesamin that exploit the potency as antagonists of viral protein. Among binding interactions of all ligands, Arg339 centred as the main interacting residue among almost all the ligands. Till now, many antiviral agents have shown potency in only mild cases of SARS-CoV-2, but no effective drug has been found for critical pulmonary cases. In clinical trials, many broad-spectrum antiviral agents have been still in trial periods of testing against SARS-CoV-2. Till date, no effective drug or vaccine has been validated with significant efficacy and potency against the SARS-CoV-2; therefore, there is an urgent need to design effective vaccine against nCoV-19 infection.","Mahrosh, Hafiza Salaha; Mustafa, Ghulam",Environ Dev Sustain,441,29

Here, we analyzed CD39 and CD73 on different lymphocyte populations in a small cohort of COVID-19 patients and in healthy individuals. We describe a significantly lower level of expression of CD73 on cytotoxic lymphocyte populations, including CD8+ T, natural killer T (NKT), and natural killer (NK) cells, during COVID-19. Interestingly, the decrease of CD73 on CD8+ T cells and NKT cells correlated with serum ferritin levels. Furthermore, we observed distinct functional differences between the CD73+ and CD73- subsets of CD8+ T cells and NKT cells with regard to cytokine/toxin secretion. In COVID-19 patients, the majority of the CD73-CD8+ T cells were capable of secreting granzyme B, perforin, tumor necrosis factor (TNF-&#945;) or interferon-gamma (IFN-Î³). To conclude, in this first study of CD39 and CD73 expression of lymphocytes in COVID-19, we show that CD8+ T cells and NKT cells lacking CD73 possess a significantly higher cytotoxic effector functionality compared to their CD73+ counterparts. Future studies should investigate differences of cellular CD39 and CD73 expression in patients at different disease stages and their potential as prognostic markers or targets for immunomodulatory therapies.","Ahmadi, Parimah; Hartjen, Philip; Kohsar, Matin; Kummer, Silke; Schmiedel, Stefan; Bockmann, Jan-Hendrik; Fathi, Anahita; Huber, Samuel; Haag, Friedrich; Schulze Zur Wiesch, Julian",,441,16

We found an increase in vaccine-related tweets by legislators following the arrival of SARS-CoV-2 in the United States. In the pre-COVID-19 era the majority of vaccine-related tweets were generated by Democrat and state senators. The increase in tweets following the arrival of COVID-19, however, was greater among Republican and federal legislators than Democrat or state legislators.

Over a 10-14 day treatment course, acalabrutinib improved oxygenation in a majority of patients, often within 1-3 days, and had no discernable toxicity. Measures of inflammation - C-reactive protein and IL-6 - normalized quickly in most patients, as did lymphopenia, in correlation with improved oxygenation. At the end of acalabrutinib treatment, 8/11 (72.7%) patients in the supplemental oxygen cohort had been discharged on room air, and 4/8 (50%) patients in the mechanical ventilation cohort had been successfully extubated, with 2/8 (25%) discharged on room air.

We profiled 26 COVID-19 autopsy cases from four cohorts in Wuhan, China, and determined the systemic distribution of SARS-CoV-2. SARS-CoV-2 was detected in the lungs and multiple extrapulmonary organs of critically ill COVID-19 patients up to 67 days after symptom onset. Based on organotropism and pathological features of the patients, COVID-19 was divided into viral intrapulmonary and systemic subtypes. In patients with systemic viral distribution, SARS-CoV-2 was detected in monocytes, macrophages, and vascular endothelia at blood-air barrier, blood-testis barrier, and filtration barrier. Critically ill patients with long disease duration showed decreased pulmonary cell proliferation, reduced viral RNA, and marked fibrosis in the lungs. Permanent SARS-CoV-2 presence and tissue injuries in the lungs and extrapulmonary organs suggest direct viral invasion as a mechanism of pathogenicity in critically ill patients. SARS-CoV-2 may hijack monocytes, macrophages, and vascular endothelia at physiological barriers as the ports of entry for systemic dissemination.

Rapid antigen (AG) tests provide results within minutes;however, their accuracy has been questioned. The study aims to determine the accuracy and cost of the STANDARD Q COVID-19 AG test compared with RT-PCR. METHODS: Individuals 18 years or older with an appointment for a RT-PCR test on 26-31 December 2020 at a public test centre in Copenhagen, Denmark were invited to participate. An oropharyngeal swab was collected for RT-PCR analysis, followed by a nasopharyngeal swab examined by the AG test (SD Biosensor). The diagnostic accuracy of the AG test was calculated with RT-PCR as reference. Costs were evaluated for both tests. RESULTS: A total of 4,811 paired conclusive test results were collected (median age: 45 years, female: 53%). The RT-PCR test revealed 221 (4.6%) positive tests. The overall sensitivity and specificity of the AG test were 69.7% and 99.5%, respectively. Viral cycle threshold values were significantly higher in individuals with false negative AG tests than in individuals who were true positives. The RT-PCR test and AG test costs were 67.0 DKK (10.8 USD) and 35.0 DKK (5.7 USD), respectively, per positive case detected at 100,000 daily tests. CONCLUSIONS: The AG test enables mass testing and provides immediate results, which is important in SARS-CoV-2 screening.

However, the downside of the SETD6 is that it cannot be directly utilized as an inflammatory regulator due to the short half-life and poor intracellular delivery. Here, a ferritin nanocage-based delivery system is presented that can maintain the activity of SETD6 in vivo. According to the analysis of severe COVID-19 patients’ peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), the SETD6 expression is downregulated while that of NF-κB is upregulated. By engineering the structure of ferritin, a protein scaffold is fabricated in which short ferritin is decorated with cell-penetrating peptide and nuclear-localizing TAT-NBD peptide together with SETD6, termed TFS. The TFS enhances the SETD6 level and reduces the NF-κB signaling in PBMCs of severe COVID-19 patients and subsequently suppresses the cytokine storm. When the TFS is intravenously administered in the cytokine storm mouse model, the survival rate is rescued and the lung tissue damage and cytokine expression are also inhibited. These results indicate that the ferritin nanocage-based peptide delivery system allows stable in vivo delivery and efficient suppression of NF-κB signaling-mediated inflammation.","Kim, Hong Nam; Park, Hee Ho; Lim, Wonhee; Hong, Kyung Soo; Ahn, June Hong; Na, Dong Hee; Kim, In-San; Jang, Jong Geol; Bae, Jong-Sup; Lee, Wonhwa",Adv.

A number of methods using both short- and long-read technologies are currently being applied for SARS-CoV-2 sequencing, including amplicon approaches, metagenomic methods, and sequence capture or enrichment methods. Given the small genome size, the ability to sequence SARS-CoV-2 at scale is limited by the cost and labor associated with making sequencing libraries. RESULTS: Here we describe a low-cost, streamlined, all amplicon-based method for sequencing SARS-CoV-2, which bypasses costly and time-consuming library preparation steps. We benchmark this tailed amplicon method against both the ARTIC amplicon protocol and sequence capture approaches and show that an optimized tailed amplicon approach achieves comparable amplicon balance, coverage metrics, and variant calls to the ARTIC v3 approach. CONCLUSIONS: The tailed amplicon method we describe represents a cost-effective and highly scalable method for SARS-CoV-2 sequencing.","Gohl, Daryl M; Garbe, John; Grady, Patrick; Daniel, Jerry; Watson, Ray H B; Auch, Benjamin; Nelson, Andrew; Yohe, Sophia; Beckman, Kenneth B",BMC Genomics,441,16

To minimize SARS-CoV-2 spread, understanding the mechanisms of infection from all possible routes of entry is essential. While aerosol transmission is thought to be the primary route of spread, viral particles have been detected in ocular fluid, suggesting that the eye may be a vulnerable point of viral entry. To this end, we confirmed SARS-CoV-2 entry factor and antigen expression in post-mortem COVID-19 patient ocular surface tissue and observed productive viral replication in cadaver samples and eye organoid cultures, most notably in limbal regions. Transcriptional analysis of ex vivo infected ocular surface cells and hESC-derived eye cultures revealed robust induction of NF-&#954;B in infected cells as well as diminished type I/III interferon signaling. Together these data suggest that the eye can be directly infected by SARS-CoV-2 and implicate limbus as a portal for viral entry.","Eriksen, Anne Z; Møller, Rasmus; Makovoz, Bar; Uhl, Skyler A; tenOever, Benjamin R; Blenkinsop, Timothy A",Cell Stem Cell,441,24

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, nonessential clinical visits were greatly limited, and much of the outpatient neurosurgical practice at the authors' institution was shifted quickly to telehealth. Although there are prior data suggesting that the use of telemedicine is satisfactory in other surgical fields, data in neurosurgery are limited. This study aimed to investigate both patient and provider satisfaction with telemedicine and its strengths and limitations in outpatient neurosurgery visits. METHODS: This quality improvement study was designed to analyze provider and patient satisfaction with telemedicine consultations in an outpatient neurosurgery clinic setting at a tertiary care, large-volume, academic center. The authors designed an 11-question survey for neurosurgical providers and a 13-question survey for patients using both closed 5-point Likert scale responses and multiple choice responses. The questionnaires were administered to patients and providers during the period when the clinic restricted in-person visits. At the conclusion of the study, the overall data were analyzed qualitatively and quantitatively. RESULTS: During the study period, 607 surveys were sent out to patients seen by telehealth at the authors' academic center, and 122 responses were received. For the provider survey, 85 surveys were sent out to providers at the authors' center and other academic centers, and 40 surveys were received. Ninety-two percent of patients agreed or strongly agreed that they were satisfied with that particular telehealth visit. Eighty-eight percent of patients agreed that their telehealth visit was more convenient for them than an in-person visit, but only 36% of patients stated they would like their future visits to be telehealth. Sixty-three percent of providers agreed that telehealth visits were more convenient for them than in-person visits, and 85% of responding providers stated that they wished to incorporate telehealth into their future practice. CONCLUSIONS: Although the authors' transition to telehealth was both rapid and unexpected, most providers and patients reported positive experiences with their telemedicine visits and found telemedicine to be an effective form of ambulatory neurosurgical care. Not all patients preferred telemedicine visits over in-person visits, but the high satisfaction with telemedicine by both providers and patients is promising to the future expansion of telehealth in ambulatory neurosurgery.","Mohanty, Alina; Srinivasan, Visish M; Burkhardt, Jan-Karl; Johnson, Jeremiah; Patel, Akash J; Sheth, Sameer A; Viswanathan, Ashwin; Yoshor, Daniel; Kan, Peter",Neurosurg Focus,441,20

In search for novel treatment strategies against COVID-19, exosomes have attracted the attention of scientists and pharmaceutical companies worldwide. Exosomes are small extracellular vesicles, secreted by all types of cells, and considered as key mediators of intercellular communication and stem-cell paracrine signaling. Herein, we reviewed the most recent literature about the role of exosomes as potential agents for treatment, prevention, diagnosis, and pathogenesis of COVID-19. Several studies and ongoing clinical trials have been investigating the anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory, and reparative effects of exosomes derived from mesenchymal stem/stromal cells for COVID-19-related acute lung injury. Other studies reported that exosomes play a key role in convalescent plasma therapy for COVID-19, and that they could be of use for the treatment of COVID-19 Kawasaki's-like multisystem inflammatory syndrome and as drug delivery nanocarriers for antiviral therapy. Harnessing some advantageous aspects of exosome biology, such as their endogenous origin, capability of crossing biological barriers, high stability in circulation, and low toxicity and immunogenicity, several companies have been testing exosome-based vaccines against SARS-CoV-2. As they carry cargos that mimic the status of parent cells, exosomes can be isolated from a variety of sources, including plasma, and employed as biomarkers of COVID-19. Lastly, there is growing evidence supporting the role of exosomes in COVID-19 infection, spread, reactivation, and reinfection. The lessons learned using exosomes for COVID-19 will help determine their efficacy and applicability in other clinical conditions.","Zani-Ruttenstock, Elke; Antounians, Lina; Khalaj, Kasra; Figueira, Rebeca L; Zani, Augusto",Eur J Pediatr Surg,441,26

Many patients at risk for severe COVID-19 manifestation have been identified as those with preexisting conditions of pulmonary origin, as well as conditions that impair appropriate immune response, such as obesity. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study is to describe the manifestation, clinical course, and inflammatory biomarker milieu of COVID-19 in patients with obesity. SETTING: University Hospital Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. METHODS: In this retrospective cohort study, 600 patients who were positive for COVID-19 were stratified by World Health Organization (WHO) obesity class and their presenting symptoms, disease biomarkers, demographics, and outcomes (intubation rate, intensive care unit [ICU] admission, length of stay [LOS], and mortality) were investigated. RESULTS: Age was inversely related to obesity class; patients of obesity class III presented 12.9 years younger than patients of normal weight (P < .0001). Initial ferritin lab values were negatively correlated with increasing obesity class (P = .0192). Normal or near-normal lymphocyte profile was noted in patients with obesity compared with patients without obesity (P = .0017). Patients with obesity had an increased rate of ICU admission (P = .0215) and increased length of stay (P = .0004), but no differences in intubation rate (P = .3705) or mortality (P = .2486). CONCLUSION: Patients with obesity were more likely to present to the hospital at a younger age, with reduced levels of COVID-19 related biomarker disturbances, and increased LOS and ICU admission rates, although were not at increased risk for mortality.","Le Guen, Claire L; King, Neil A; Zhao, Huaqing; Renza-Stingone, Elizabeth P; Gerhard, Glenn S; Soans, Rohit S",Surg. obes. relat. dis,441,1

Among them, the limitation of the two-dimensional presentation of its notations and lack of natural collaborative modeling tools are reported to be significant. In this paper, we explore the potential of using Virtual Reality (VR) technology for collaborative UML software design by comparing it with classical collaborative software design using conventional devices (Desktop PC, Laptop). For this purpose, we have developed a VR modeling environment that offers a natural collaborative modeling experience for UML Class Diagrams. Based on a user study with 24 participants, we have compared collaborative VR modeling with conventional modeling with regard to efficiency, effectiveness, and user satisfaction. Results show that the use of VR has some disadvantages concerning efficiency and effectiveness, but the user's fun, the feeling of being in the same room with a remote collaborator, and the naturalness of collaboration were increased.","Yigitbas, Enes; Gorissen, Simon; Weidmann, Nils; Engels, Gregor",,441,27

MATERIAL AND METHODS: A cohort study was designed to evaluate whether a therapeutic algorithm using steroids with or without interleukin-1 antagonist (anakinra) could prevent death/invasive ventilation. Patients with a &#8805;5-day evolution since symptoms onset, with hyper-inflammation (CRP&#8805;50mg/L), requiring 3-5 L/min oxygen, received methylprednisolone alone. Patients needing &#8805;6 L/min received methylprednisolone + subcutaneous anakinra daily either frontline or in case clinical deterioration upon corticosteroids alone. Death rate and death or intensive care unit (ICU) invasive ventilation rate at Day 15, with Odds Ratio (OR) and 95% CIs, were determined according to logistic regression and propensity scores. A Bayesian analysis estimated the treatment effects. RESULTS: Of 108 consecutive patients, 70 patients received glucocorticoids alone. The control group comprised 63 patients receiving standard of care. In the corticosteroid±stanakinra group (n = 108), death rate was 20.4%, versus 30.2% in the controls, indicating a 30% relative decrease in death risk and a number of 10 patients to treat to avoid a death (p = 0.15). Using propensity scores a per-protocol analysis showed an OR for COVID-19-related death of 0.9 (95%CI [0.80-1.01], p = 0.067). On Bayesian analysis, the posterior probability of any mortality benefit with corticosteroids+/-anakinra was 87.5%, with a 7.8% probability of treatment-related harm. Pre-existing diabetes exacerbation occurred in 29 of 108 patients (26.9%). CONCLUSION: In COVID-19 non-ICU inpatients at the cytokine release phase, corticosteroids with or without anakinra were associated with a 30% decrease of death risk on Day 15.","Borie, Raphael; Savale, Laurent; Dossier, Antoine; Ghosn, Jade; Taillé, Camille; Visseaux, Benoit; Jebreen, Kamel; Diallo, Abourahmane; Tesmoingt, Chloe; Morer, Lise; Goletto, Tiphaine; Faucher, Nathalie; Hajouji, Linda; Neukirch, Catherine; Phillips, Mathilde; Stelianides, Sandrine; Bouadma, Lila; Brosseau, Solenn; Ottaviani, Sébastien; Pluvy, Johan; Le Pluart, Diane; Debray, Marie-Pierre; Raynaud-Simon, Agathe; Descamps, Diane; Khalil, Antoine; Timsit, Jean Francois; Lescure, Francois-Xavier; Descamps, Vincent; Papo, Thomas; Humbert, Marc; Crestani, Bruno; Dieude, Philippe; Vicaut, Eric; Zalcman, Gérard",PLoS One,441,16

Methods: We conducted a prospective single-center study (NCT04689490) of previously hospitalized COVID-19 patients with and without dyspnea during mid-term follow-up. An outpatient group was also evaluated. They underwent serial testing with a cardiopulmonary exercise test (CPET), transthoracic echocardiogram, pulmonary lung test, six-minute walking test, serum biomarker analysis, and quality of life questionaries.

The aim of this study is to determine the knowledge, attitude, and practice and also the perceptions of restaurants' customers and managers toward COVID-19 prevention. Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted using the mixed-method approach. Two online questionnaires were undertaken through WhatsApp Messenger among the 210 customers and 50 managers of restaurants. Multivariate linear regression analysis was conducted to identify the predictors of knowledge, attitude, and practice toward COVID-19 prevention. Then semi-structured, in-depth phone interviews were conducted with 45 subjects to identify their perceptions about the restaurant industry during the COVID-19 pandemic. Results: The majority of customers had moderate knowledge (72.4%), positive attitude (90.5%), and desirable practice (38.6%); whereas the majority of managers had sufficient knowledge (50%), negative attitude (82%), and acceptable practice (58%) toward the prevention of COVID-19 in restaurants. Multiple linear regression analysis showed with increasing each 10 years in the age of the customers, the practice score significantly decreased (Beta = -0.155, p < 0.05). Moreover, qualitative results revealed three categories (1. restaurant industry, 2. social media, and 3. government) in 9 themes with 32 sub-themes which were explored based on the perception of the participants toward COVID-19 prevention in restaurants. Conclusion: The majority of restaurant customers and managers have sufficient knowledge and acceptable practice, but a positive attitude among customers and a negative attitude among managers about the prevention of COVID-19 were shown. There is an urgent need to understand public awareness about preventing COVID-19 in restaurants at these critical moments. The results seek to provide strategies for the policymakers and restaurant industry to plan the specific educational intervention about how to manage future crises and public health improvement.","Mohammadi-Nasrabadi, Fatemeh; Salmani, Yeganeh; Broumandnia, Nasrin; Esfarjani, Fatemeh",Front Public Health,441,9

The virus surface spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 mediates viral entry into cells by binding to the ACE2 receptor on epithelial cells and promoting fusion. We found that Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) induces ACE2 expression when it enters the lytic replicative cycle in epithelial cells. By using vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) particles pseudotyped with the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, we showed that lytic EBV replication enhances ACE2-dependent SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus entry. We found that the ACE2 promoter contains response elements for Zta, an EBV transcriptional activator that is essential for EBV entry into the lytic cycle of replication. Zta preferentially acts on methylated promoters, allowing it to reactivate epigenetically silenced EBV promoters from latency. By using promoter assays, we showed that Zta directly activates methylated ACE2 promoters. Infection of normal oral keratinocytes with EBV leads to lytic replication in some of the infected cells, induces ACE2 expression, and enhances SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus entry. These data suggest that subclinical EBV replication and lytic gene expression in epithelial cells, which is ubiquitous in the human population, may enhance the efficiency and extent of SARS-CoV-2 infection of epithelial cells by transcriptionally activating ACE2 and increasing its cell surface expression. IMPORTANCE SARS-CoV-2, the coronavirus responsible for COVID-19, has caused a pandemic leading to millions of infections and deaths worldwide. Identifying the factors governing susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 is important in order to develop strategies to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection. We show that Epstein-Barr virus, which infects and persists in >90% of adult humans, increases susceptibility of epithelial cells to infection by SARS-CoV-2. EBV, when it reactivates from latency or infects epithelial cells, increases expression of ACE2, the cellular receptor for SARS-CoV-2, enhancing infection by SARS-CoV-2. Inhibiting EBV replication with antivirals may therefore decrease susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Verma, Dinesh; Church, Trenton Mel; Swaminathan, Sankar",J Virol,441,20

We established the COronavirus Pandemic Epidemiology (COPE) consortium to address this unprecedented crisis on behalf of the epidemiology research community. As a central component of this initiative, we have developed a COVID Symptom Study (previously known as the COVID Symptom Tracker) mobile application as a common data collection tool for epidemiologic cohort studies with active study participants. This mobile application collects information on risk factors, daily symptoms, and outcomes through a user-friendly interface that minimizes participant burden. Combined with our efforts within the general population, data collected from nearly 3 million participants in the United States and United Kingdom are being used to address critical needs in the emergency response, including identifying potential hot spots of disease and clinically actionable risk factors. The linkage of symptom data collected in the app with information and biospecimens already collected in epidemiology cohorts will position us to address key questions related to diet, lifestyle, environmental, and socioeconomic factors on susceptibility to COVID-19, clinical outcomes related to infection, and long-term physical, mental health, and financial sequalae.

One important challenge of this unique stressor is maintaining well-functioning intimate relationships, which are inextricably tied to emotional and physical health. Yet research on romantic relationships shows that external stressors such as economic hardship, demanding jobs, and disasters can threaten the quality and stability of couples' relationships. Research within relationship science investigating how external stressors and existing vulnerabilities shape couple functioning can inform predictions about how the current pandemic will impact couples' relationships and which couples in which contexts may be most at risk for adverse relationship consequences. Drawing on theory and research from relationship science, the presented conceptual framework, adapted from the vulnerability-stress-adaptation model (Karney & Bradbury, 1995), suggests that facing COVID-19-related external stress is likely to increase harmful dyadic processes (e.g., hostility, withdrawal, less responsive support), which will undermine couples' relationship quality. These harmful effects are likely to be exacerbated by the broader preexisting context in which couples' relationships are situated (e.g., social class, minority status, age), and their individual vulnerabilities (e.g., attachment insecurity, depression). The framework presented identifies the essential factors that need to be addressed in order to mitigate the potential adverse effects of the current crisis on relationships, and offers key directions for future research.

By considering the most up to date information on GDP and carbon intensity of production, this paper represents one of the first attempts to estimate the CO2 emissions change that have taken place in Europe during the first six months of 2020. Results show that more than 195,600 thousand tons of CO2 have been avoided between January and June 2020, compared to the same period of the previous year, representing a -12.1% emissions change. The largest reductions have taken place in the Manufacturing, Wholesale, Retail Trade, Transport, Accommodation and Food Service sectors, accounting for more than 93.7% of total CO2 change. Spain, Italy and France have been the most affected areas with -106,600 thousand tons emissions drop. In line with the results provided by previous studies, this paper highlights that the geographical and the sectoral distribution of the CO2 emissions change has been largely influenced by the magnitude of the COVID-19 impacts. In addition, the carbon intensity of production, characterizing the most affected economic activities, has been the main element of differentiation compared to the previous 2008 crisis. By providing preliminary estimation of the CO2 emissions change that have taken place across geographical and sectoral activities, this paper contributes to the existing climate policy debate and can support future estimation of CO2 variations both in a context of confinement release as well as in a context of reintroduced COVID-19 restrictions.","Andreoni, Valeria",Sci Total Environ,441,16

This was a single-centre retrospective cohort review of a UK district general hospital serving a population of over 250,000 people. METHODS: Participants were all patients undergoing a surgical procedure in the acute theatre list between 23 March to 11 May in both 2019 and 2020. Primary outcome was 90-day postoperative mortality. Secondary outcomes include time to surgical intervention and length of inpatient stay. RESULTS: A total of 132 patients (2020) versus 141 (2019) patients were included. Although overall 90-day postoperative mortality was higher in 2020 (9.8%) compared with 2019 (5.7%), this difference was not statistically significant (p=0.196). In 2020, eight patients tested positive for COVID-19 either as an inpatient or within 2 weeks of discharge, of whom five patients died. Time to surgical intervention was significantly faster for NCEPOD (National Confidential Enquiry into Patient Outcome and Death) code 3 patients in 2020 than in 2019 (p=0.027). There were no significant differences in mean length of inpatient stay. CONCLUSIONS: We found that patients were appropriately prioritised using NCEPOD classification, with no statistically significant differences in 90-day postoperative mortality and length of inpatient stay compared with the 2019 period. A study on a larger scale would further elucidate the profile and outcomes of patients requiring acute surgery to generate statistical significance.","Luo, W; Limb, R; Aslam, A; Kattimani, R; Karthikappallil, D; Paramasivan, A; Waseem, M",Ann R Coll Surg Engl,441,24

Many European governments have introduced policy interventions to mitigate and protect their economies. Yet, water resources, which are a potential enabler in revitalising Europe's economy, have received few of such policy interventions since the World Health Organization declared the COVID-19 outbreak as a public health emergency only in January 2020. Our scoping review of preliminary government responses of 27 European countries revealed that only 11 (40.7%) of these countries implemented at least one policy intervention that considered the water sector. These interventions were typically short-term measures involving either full cost absorption or deferment of water bills. Much attention on water governance and management processes, policies and financial investments required to augment the resilience of the water sector amid a growing scarcity of freshwater, triggered by extreme climate variation and also by COVID-19 pandemic should therefore be central to post COVID-19 recovery efforts in Europe.

The most widely used vision assistance apps are magnifier apps. It is still largely unknown what the apps are used for. Lack of insight into the visual needs of individuals with visual impairment is a hurdle for the development of more effective assistive technologies. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate how needs for visual aids may vary with social activities, by observing the changes in the usage of a smartphone magnifier app when many users take breaks from work. METHODS: The number of launches of the SuperVision Magnifier app was determined retrospectively from 2018 to 2020 from among active users worldwide. The fluctuation in app usage was examined by comparing weekday vs weekend periods, Christmas and new year vs nonholiday seasons, and COVID-19 lockdowns vs the easing of restriction during the pandemic. RESULTS: On average, the app was used 262,466 times by 38,237 users each month in 2020 worldwide. There were two major trough points on the timeline of weekly app usage, one aligned with the COVID-19 lockdowns in April 2020 and another aligned with the Christmas and new year week in 2018 and 2019. The app launches declined by 6947 (11% decline; P<.001) during the lockdown and by 5212 (9% decline; P=.001) during the holiday weeks. There was no significant decline during March to May 2019. App usage compensated for seasonal changes was 8.6% less during weekends than during weekdays (P<.001). CONCLUSIONS: The need for vision assistance technology was slightly lower during breaks and lockdowns, probably because the activities at home were different and less visually demanding. Nevertheless, for the entire user population, the needs for visual aids are still substantial.","Luo, Gang; Pundlik, Shrinivas",J Med Internet Res,441,1

The extent of the impact of COVID-19 on prison staff and prisoners in England and Wales is unknown. Testing for COVID-19 both asymptomatic and symptomatic, as well as for antibodies, to date, has been minimal. The purpose of this paper is to explore the widespread testing of COVID-19 in prisons poses philosophical and ethical questions around trust, efficacy and ethicacy. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH: This paper is both descriptive, providing an overview of the widespread testing of COVID-19 in prisoners in England and Wales, and conceptual in that it discusses and argues the issues associated with large-scale testing. This paper provides a discussion, using comparative studies, of the issues associated with large-scale testing of prisoners across the prison estate in England and Wales (120 prisons). The issues identified in this paper are contextualised through the lens of COVID-19, but they are equally transferrable to epidemiological studies of any pandemic. Given the prevalence of COVID-19 globally and the lack of information about its spread in prisons, at the time of writing this paper, there is a programme of asymptomatic testing of prisoners. However, there remains a paucity of data on the spread of COVID-19 in prisons because of the progress with the ongoing testing programme. FINDINGS: The authors argue that the widespread testing of prisoners requires careful consideration of the details regarding who is included in testing, how consent is gained and how tests are administered. This paper outlines and argues the importance of considering the complex nuance of power relationships within the prison system, among prisoner officers, medical staff and prisoners and the detrimental consequences. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS: The widespread testing of COVID-19 presents ethical and practical challenges. Careful planning is required when considering the ethics of who should be included in COVID-19 testing, how consent will be gained, who and how tests will be administered and very practical challenges around the recording and assigning of COVID-19 test kits inside the prison. The current system for the general population requires scanning of barcodes and registration using a mobile number; these facilities are not permitted inside a prison. ORIGINALITY/VALUE: This paper looks at the issues associated with mass testing of prisoners for COVID-19. According to the authors' knowledge, there has not been any research that looks at the issues of testing either in the UK or internationally. The literature available details countries' responses to the pandemic rather and scientific papers on the development of vaccines. Therefore, this paper is an original review of some of the practicalities that need to be addressed to ensure that testing can be as successful as possible.","Lambert, Steve; Wilkinson, Dean",International journal of prisoner health (Online),441,26

The present study aimed to investigate the host inflammatory response signature­caused by SARS­CoV­2 in human corneal epithelial cells (HCECs). The expression level of angiotensin­converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) in the human cornea was determined via immunofluorescence. In vitro experiments were performed in HCECs stimulated with the SARS­CoV­2 spike protein. Moreover, the expression levels of ACE2, IL­8, TNF­&#945;, IL­6, gasdermin D (GSDMD) and IL­1ß in HCECs were detected using reverse transcription­quantitative PCR and/or western blotting. It was identified that ACE2 was expressed in normal human corneal epithelium and HCECs cultured in vitro. Furthermore, the expression levels of IL­8, TNF­&#945; and IL­6 in HCECs were decreased following SARS­CoV­2 spike protein stimulation, while the expression levels of GSDMD and IL­1ß were increased. In conclusion, the present results demonstrated that the SARS­CoV­2 spike protein suppressed the host inflammatory response and induced pyroptosis in HCECs. Therefore, blocking the ACE2 receptor in HCECs may reduce the infection rate of COVID­19.","Zhu, Guoqiang; Lyu, Leyu; Yang, Hua; Liu, Guibo; Yang, Shuo; Gu, Chuankai; Wang, Limei; Yan, Haijing; Hu, Ming; Che, Chengye",Mol.

METHODS: A systematic search of PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and Google Scholar databases was performed up to August 19, 2020.We included studies that reported infections with COVID-19 and symptoms of otolaryngology. The retrieved data from the respective studies were evaluated and summarized. The study's immediate result was to assess the combined prevalence of otorhinolaryngological symptoms in patients with COVID-19. However, the secondary result was to determine the exacerbation of COVID-19 infection in patients with otorhinolaryngological symptoms. RESULTS: Fifty-four studies with 16,478 patients were included. Olfactory dysfunction, sneezing and sputum production were the 3 most prevalent otorhinolaryngological symptoms in patients with COVID-19. The pooled prevalence amongst the prevalent symptoms was 47% (95% CI 29-65; range 0-98; I2 = 99.58%), 27% (95% CI 11-48; range 12-40; I2 = 93.34%), and 22% (95% CI 16-30; range 2-56; I2 = 97.60%), respectively. The proportion of severely ill patients with sputum production and shortness of breath was significantly higher among patients with COVID-19 infections (OR 1.66 [95% CI 1.08-2.54]; P = 0.02, I2 = 51% and 3.29 [95% CI 1.57-6.90]; P = 0.002, I2 = 49%, respectively). Subgroup analysis showed no statistically significant differences between the incidence of otolaryngology symptoms in severely ill patients and non-severely ill patients (OR 1.43 [95% CI 1.12-1.82]; P = 0.07 I2 = 53.1%). In contrast, the incidence of shortness of breath in severely ill patients was significantly increased (3.29 [1.57-6.90]; P = 0.002, I2 = 49%). CONCLUSION: Our research shows that otorhinolaryngology symptoms in patients with COVID-19 are not uncommon, which should attract otorhinolaryngologists' attention.","Qiu, Jingjing; Yang, Xin; Liu, Limei; Wu, Ting; Cui, Limei; Mou, Yakui; Sun, Yan",Eur. arch. oto-rhino-laryngol,441,6

Meanwhile, the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) was implementing a teacher-led extracurricular activity for children of age 10-15 years to prevent substance use and other negative life and social consequences (Lions Quest Skills for Adolescence [LQSFA]). Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, LQSFA was difficult to sustain, partly as it was considered extracurricular and partly given its interactive requirement that was difficult to apply through distance learning. Nevertheless, schools' facilitators managed to adapt the program information sharing and communication strategies with the student groups and identified essential sessions allowing continuity of program implementation and utilization of critical program skills during COVID-19 pandemic. The practical implication of the facilitators' assessment of the relevance, value, motivation and feasibility of the implementation of the LQSFA program within the current COVID-19 circumstances calls for the eminent need for adaptation of its implementation modality to meet the current educational delivery circumstances.

However, there is little research on how individuals' coping strategies were related to changes in mental health over time. METHODS: The current study used data from the COVID-19 Social Study in the United Kingdom (N = 26,505) to explore whether coping strategies (problem-focused, emotion-focused, avoidant, and socially-supportive) were associated with (i) better mental health as lockdown was introduced, and (ii) faster recovery over time. RESULTS: People with greater use of problem-focused, avoidant, and supportive coping displayed more mental health symptoms, while greater use of emotion-focused coping was associated with fewer mental health symptoms. Symptoms decreased over time for all coping strategies, but only socially-supportive coping was associated with a faster decrease in anxiety and depressive symptoms, indicating a potential protective effect of social support on psychological distress. CONCLUSIONS: Problem-, avoidant- and emotion-focused coping strategies were not associated with faster improvements in mental health. Suggesting the adoption of one of these coping styles in itself is not necessarily a driver of improvements in mental health; rather, specific attributes of the behaviours expressed as part of this coping style appear to be important in and of themselves.","Fluharty, Meg; Bu, Feifei; Steptoe, Andrew; Fancourt, Daisy",Soc Sci Med,441,10

The 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has drawn attention to the lack of state guidance on how hospitals should provide care in a crisis. When the resources available are insufficient to treat the current patient load, crisis standards of care (CSC) are implemented to provide care to the population in an ethical manner, while maintaining an ability to handle the surge. This Editorial aims to raise awareness concerning a lack of preparedness that calls for immediate correction at the state and local level.Analysis of state guidelines for implementation of CSC demonstrates a lack of preparedness, as only five states in the US have appropriately completed necessary plans, despite a clear understanding of the danger. States have a legal responsibility to regulate the medical care within their borders. Failure of hospital facilities to properly prepare for disasters is not a new issue; Hurricane Katrina (2005) demonstrated a lack of planning and coordination. Improving disaster health care readiness in the United States requires states to create new policy and legislative directives for the health care facilities within their respective jurisdictions. Hospitals should have clear directives to prepare for disasters as part of a ""duty to care"" and to ensure that the necessary planning and supplies are available to their employees.","Ingram, Annie E; Hertelendy, Attila J; Molloy, Michael S; Ciottone, Gregory R",Prehosp Disaster Med,441,16

We aim to explore the correlation between the different doses of corticosteroid administration and the prognosis of ARDS. Methods: All patients were diagnosed with ARDS on initial hospital admission and received systemic corticosteroid treatment for ARDS. The main outcomes were the effects of corticosteroid treatment on clinical parameters and the mortality of ARDS patients. Secondary outcomes were factors associated with the mortality of ARDS patients. Results: 105 ARDS patients were included in this study. Corticosteroid treatment markedly decreased serum interleukin-18 (IL-18) level (424.0 ± 32.19 vs. 290.2 ± 17.14; p = 0.0003) and improved arterial partial pressure of oxygen/fraction of inspired oxygen (PaO(2)/FiO(2)) (174.10 ± 65.28 vs. 255.42 ± 92.49; p < 0.0001). The acute physiology and chronic health evaluation (APACHE II) score (16.15 ± 4.41 vs. 14.88 ± 4.57, p = 0.042) decreased significantly on the seventh day after systemic corticosteroid treatment. Interestingly, the serum IL-18 decreased significantly (304.52 ± 286.00 vs. 85.85 ± 97.22, p < 0.0001), whereas the improvement of PaO(2)/FiO(2) (24.78 ± 35.03 vs. 97.17 ± 44.82, p < 0.001) was inconspicuous after systemic corticosteroid treatment for non-survival patients, compared with survival patients. Furthermore, the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) model revealed, when equivalent methylprednisolone usage was 146.5 mg/d, it had the best sensitivity and specificity to predict the death of ARDS. Survival analysis by Kaplan–Meier curves presented the higher 45-day mortality in high-dose corticosteroid treatment group (logrank test p < 0.0001). Multivariate Cox regression analyses demonstrated that serum IL-18 level, APACHE II score, D-dimer, and high-dose corticosteroid treatment were associated with the death of ARDS. Conclusion: Appropriate dose of corticosteroids may be beneficial for ARDS patients through improving the oxygenation and moderately inhibiting inflammatory response. The benefits and risks should be carefully weighed when using high-dose corticosteroid for ARDS. Trial registration: This work was registered in ClinicalTrials.gov.

First, data visualization is provided on increases in confirmed deaths and recovered cases of COVID-19 using currently available data from Johns Hopkins University. Next, the machine learning algorithms are used for the automatic diagnosis of COVID-19. Data-driven diagnosis is performed using a dataset of 5644 samples with 111 attributes provided by Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein, Brazil. As a preprocessing step, null values and categorical data are processed and standardization is performed. Next, feature selection is performed to find attributes that are most important for a COVID-19 diagnosis. A number of algorithms including random forest logistic regression, XGBoost, and decision tree are considered and their kernel parameters are optimized. The performance of classification algorithms is evaluated in terms of a number of factors including the testing accuracy, precision, recall, miss rate, receiver operating characteristic curve and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve. Experimental results show that serum glucose is the most influential attribute in predicting COVID-19. Our results also show that for the case of cross-validation, XGBoost has the highest accuracy value of 92.67% and logistic regressions have the second highest accuracy of 92.58%, whereas both XGBoost and LR have a 93% value for precision, recall, and F1 score.

The adult CF population is increasing worldwide, with many patients surviving prolonged periods with severe multi-morbid disease. In many countries the number of adults with CF exceeds the number of children, and PEx are particularly burdensome for adults as they tend to require longer courses and more intravenous treatment than children. The approach to managing PEx is multifactorial and needs to evolve to reflect this changing adult population. In this review, we discuss PEx definitions, precipitants, treatments and the wider implications to healthcare resources. We review current management strategies, their relevance in particular to adults with CF, and highlight some of the gaps in our knowledge. A number of studies are underway to try to answer some of the unmet needs, such as the optimal length of treatment and the use of non-antimicrobial agents alongside antibiotics.

However, limited research has been conducted to understand the possible mechanism that mediate, toxicity and pulmonary health effects of e-cigs. We hypothesized that sub-chronic e-cig exposure induces inflammatory response and dysregulated repair/extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling, which occur through the α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR α7). Adult wild-type (WT), nAChRα7 knockout (KO), and lung epithelial cell-specific KO (nAChRα7 CreCC10) mice were exposed to e-cig aerosol containing propylene glycol (PG) with or without nicotine. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluids (BALF) and lungs tissues were collected to determine e-cig induced inflammatory response and ECM remodeling, respectively. Sub-chronic e-cig exposure with nicotine increased the inflammatory cellular influx of macrophages and T-lymphocytes including increased pro-inflammatory cytokines in BALF and increased ACE2 Covid-19 receptor, whereas nAChR α7 KO mice show reduced inflammatory responses associated with decreased ACE2 receptor. Interestingly, matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), such as MMP2, MMP8, and MMP9 were altered both at the protein and mRNA transcript levels in female and male, but WT mice exposed to PG alone showed a sex-dependent phenotype. Moreover, MMP12 was increased significantly in male mice exposed to PG with or without nicotine in a nAChR α7-dependent manner. Additionally, sub-chronic e-cig exposure with or without nicotine altered the abundance of ECM proteins, such as collagen and fibronectin significantly in a sex-dependent manner, but without the direct role of nAChR α7 gene. Overall, sub-chronic e-cig exposure with or without nicotine affected lung inflammation and repair responses/ECM remodeling, which were mediated by nAChR α7 in a sex-dependent manner.","Wang, Qixin; Sundar, Isaac; Li, Dongmei; Lucas, Joseph; Muthumalage, Thivanka; McDonough, Samantha; Rahman, Irfan",Res Sq,441,1

Virus-neutralizing monoclonal antibodies are predicted to reduce viral load, ameliorate symptoms, and prevent hospitalization. METHODS: In this ongoing phase 2 trial involving outpatients with recently diagnosed mild or moderate Covid-19, we randomly assigned 452 patients to receive a single intravenous infusion of neutralizing antibody LY-CoV555 in one of three doses (700 mg, 2800 mg, or 7000 mg) or placebo and evaluated the quantitative virologic end points and clinical outcomes. The primary outcome was the change from baseline in the viral load at day 11. The results of a preplanned interim analysis as of September 5, 2020, are reported here. RESULTS: At the time of the interim analysis, the observed mean decrease from baseline in the log viral load for the entire population was −3.81, for an elimination of more than 99.97% of viral RNA. For patients who received the 2800-mg dose of LY-CoV555, the difference from placebo in the decrease from baseline was −0.53 (95% confidence interval [CI], −0.98 to −0.08; P=0.02), for a viral load that was lower by a factor of 3.4. Smaller differences from placebo in the change from baseline were observed among the patients who received the 700-mg dose (−0.20; 95% CI, −0.66 to 0.25; P=0.38) or the 7000-mg dose (0.09; 95% CI, −0.37 to 0.55; P=0.70). On days 2 to 6, the patients who received LY-CoV555 had a slightly lower severity of symptoms than those who received placebo. The percentage of patients who had a Covid-19–related hospitalization or visit to an emergency department was 1.6% in the LY-CoV555 group and 6.3% in the placebo group.

However, little is known about their interactions with neutrophils and how this might contribute to injury. Here, it is shown that histone H4 acts as neutrophil activator by inducing hydrogen peroxide production, degranulation, cell adhesion, and IL‐8 generation. Histone H4 caused permeabilization of the neutrophil membrane (a phenomenon described in other cell types) leading to accelerated cell death. H4 caused sustained rise in neutrophil intracellular calcium that is necessary for respiratory burst activation and degranulation. Convincing evidence was not found for TLRs or ATP receptors in H4 mediated activation. However, pertussis toxin and wortmannin (inhibitors of G protein and PI3K) inhibited H4‐induced hydrogen peroxide production and degranulation. These studies suggest that release of histone H4 in sites of infection or inflammation may potentiate neutrophil activation and promote additional inflammatory responses. These studies may provide a better basis for developing novel therapeutic strategies to block neutrophil extracellular trap (NET) and H4‐related pathology in sepsis and various forms of lung injury including that induced by viruses like influenza or SAR‐CoV2.","Hsieh, I‐Ni; Deluna, Xavier; White, Mitchell R.; Hartshorn, Kevan L.",J Leukoc Biol,441,16

The results of the finalists, winners, and last participants in the women’s and men’s finals were analyzed, and a mathematical predictive model was created. The predicted times for the future Olympics were presented. Swimming performance among Olympians has been steadily improving, with record times of 18.51 s for female finalists in the 100 m butterfly (a 24.63% improvement) and 31.33 s for male finalists in the 200 m butterfly (21.44%). The results in all analyzed groups showed improvement in athletic performance, and the gap between the finalists has narrowed. Women Olympians’ performances have improved faster than men’s, reducing the gap between genders. We conclude that swimming performance among Olympians is continuing to improve.","Hołub, Maciej; Stanula, Arkadiusz; Baron, Jakub; Głyk, Wojciech; Rosemann, Thomas; Knechtle, Beat",Int J Environ Res Public Health,441,9

In COVID-19 physiopathology, one of the main inflammation mechanisms is the “cytokine storm”, causing a pro-inflammatory state, related to cardiac and pulmonary damage. There is also a less effective role of lymphocyte B and T in the humoral immunity due to the reduction of their proliferative response. The physiopathology of ASD (Autism Spectrum Disorder) involves several modifications at the genetic and at the immune level, such as the increase of inflammatory cytokines and abnormal immune response in several levels. We hypothesize that ASD could be a risk-factor as the other conditions are.","de Sousa Lima, Matheus Eugênio; Barros, Levi Coelho Maia; Aragão, Gislei Frota",Med Hypotheses,441,16

METHOD: : A prospective cohort study was undertaken in all patients who underwent surgical (n=1429) or non-operative (n=191) management during the UK COVID-19 pandemic peak (April-May 2020); all were evaluated for 30-day COVID-related death. A representative sample of elective/trauma/burns patients (surgery group, n=729) were selected and also sub-analysed within a controlled cohort study design. Comparison was made to a random selection of non-operatively managed (non-operative group, n=100) or waiting list (control group, n=250) patients. These groups were prospectively followed-up and telephoned from the end of June (control group) or at 30 days post-first assessment (non-operative group)/post-operatively (surgery group). RESULTS: : Complex general (9.2%,136/1483) or regional (5.0%,74/1483) anaesthesia cases represented 14.2%(210/1483) of operations undertaken. There were no 30-day post-operative (0/1429)/first assessment (0/191) COVID-related deaths. Neither the 3 sub-specialty plastic surgery, or non-operative groups, displayed increases in post-operative/first assessment symptoms in comparison to each other, or to control. The proportion of COVID-19 positive tests were: 7.1%(1/14) (non-operative), 5.9%(2/34) (burns) and 3.0%(3/99) (trauma); there were however no significant differences between these groups, the elective (0%,0/54) and control (0%,0/24) groups (p=0.236). CONCLUSION: : We demonstrate that even heterogeneous sub-specialty patient groups, who required operative/non-operative management, did not incur an increased COVID-19 risk compared to each other or to control. These highly encouraging results were achieved with described, rapidly implemented service changes that were tailored to protect each patient group and staff.","BH, Miranda; WRM, Hughes; R, Pinto-Lopes; BS, Mathur; VV, Ramakrishnan; MK, Sood",J Plast Reconstr Aesthet Surg,441,16

Nonetheless, there are potential ethical and regulatory uncertainties that may impede access to those valuable biospecimens. In this article, we argue that there should be a presumption in favor of using previously collected identifiable research biospecimens without reconsent to directly address an infectious disease pandemic, assuming certain conditions are met. This argument fills a unique yet critical gap in decision‐making where the specific consent accompanying the identifiable biospecimens would not otherwise permit repurposing. Further, it suggests that even if gaining reconsent is feasible, doing so in a fast‐moving crisis is not necessary. This analysis also attempts to address the ethical concerns of public health authorities who already may have the power to use such specimens but are reluctant to do so.","Berkman, Benjamin E.; Mastroianni, Anna C.; Jamal, Leila; Solis, Coleman; Taylor, Holly A.; Hull, Sara Chandros",Ethics Hum Res,441,16

Study Design Qualitative, semi-structured interviews. Methods 30 semi-structured telephone interviews with parents of children between 4 and 18 years. Results We found four themes relating to symptom attribution (normalising symptoms, err on the side of caution, experience of temperature, symptoms not normal for us). In general, parents were more likely to attribute symptoms to COVID-19 if a temperature was present or the symptoms were perceived as unusual for their family. Four themes relating to self-isolation (difficult to prevent contact with children, isolation would be no different to lockdown life, ability to get food and supplies, limited space). Parents believed they would find isolation within the household difficult or impossible if they had dependent children, had limited space or could not shop for groceries. Conclusions The findings highlight complexities in symptom perception, attribution, and household isolation. We suggest that they can be overcome by a) providing better guidance on what symptoms require action, b) providing guidance as to how to prevent infection within the household, and c) by supporting families with grocery shopping through a potential second or third wave.","Hodson, A.; Woodland, L.; Smith, L.

Immunosuppression is a possible risk factor for severe COVID-19, although their exact interaction is unclear. A total of 13 cases with active lupus nephritis (LN, with or without extra-renal manifestations) were managed with intense immunosuppression between January 2020 and June 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic at our center. There were no other comorbidities in any patient. All patients received hydroxychloroquine as a part of standard of care. Vigorous precautionary measures were taken for preventing infection in all. One patient developed acute respiratory distress syndrome but was tested negative for COVID-19. None of the other 12 patients developed symptoms suggestive of COVID-19. We report safe management of patients with active LN with intense immunosuppression along with vigorous precautions amidst the COVID-19 pandemic. The role of hydroxychloroquine along with timely precautions needs to be further explored as protective measures against COVID-19 among systemic lupus erythematosus patients.","Bharati, Joyita; Rathi, Manish; Ramachandran, Raja; Sharma, Aman; Nada, Ritambhra; Kohli, Harbir S.",Indian J Nephrol,441,20

Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) based tests are optimal and recommended for the diagnosis of an acute SARS-CoV-2 infection. Serology tests for viral antibodies provide an important tool to diagnose previous exposure to the virus. Here we evaluate the analytical performance parameters of the Diazyme SARS-CoV-2 IgM/IgG serology assays and describe the kinetics of IgM and IgG seroconversion observed in patients with PCR confirmed COVID-19 who were admitted to our hospital. METHODS: We validated the performance of the Diazyme assay in 235 subjects to determine specificity. Subsequently, we evaluated the SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG seroconversion of 54 PCR confirmed COVID-19 patients and determined sensitivity of the assay at three different timeframes. RESULT: Sensitivity and specificity for detecting seropositivity at ≥ 15 days following a positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR result, was 100.0% and 98.7% when assaying for the panel of IgM and IgG. The median time to seropositivity observed for a reactive IgM and IgG result from the date of a positive PCR was 5 days (IQR: 2.75-9 days) and 4 days (IQR: 2.75-6.75 days), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Our data demonstrates that the Diazyme IgM/IgG assays are suited for the purpose of detecting SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgM in patients with suspected SARS-CoV-2 infections. For the first time, we report longitudinal data showing the evolution of seroconversion for both IgG and IgM in a cohort of acutely ill patients in the United States. We also demonstrate a low false positive rate in patients who were presumed to be disease free.","Suhandynata, Raymond T; Hoffman, Melissa A; Kelner, Michael J; McLawhon, Ronald W; Reed, Sharon L; Fitzgerald, Robert L",J Appl Lab Med,441,6

New antibiotics need to be developed to provide therapeutic treatment options, requiring novel drug targets to be identified and pursued. DNA topoisomerases control the topology of DNA via DNA cleavage–rejoining coupled to DNA strand passage. The change in DNA topological features must be controlled in vital processes including DNA replication, transcription, and DNA repair. Type IIA topoisomerases are well established targets for antibiotics. In this review, type IA topoisomerases in bacteria are discussed as potential targets for new antibiotics. In certain bacterial pathogens, topoisomerase I is the only type IA topoisomerase present, which makes it a valuable antibiotic target. This review will summarize recent attempts that have been made to identify inhibitors of bacterial topoisomerase I as potential leads for antibiotics and use of these inhibitors as molecular probes in cellular studies. Crystal structures of inhibitor–enzyme complexes and more in-depth knowledge of their mechanisms of actions will help to establish the structure–activity relationship of potential drug leads and develop potent and selective therapeutics that can aid in combating the drug resistant bacterial infections that threaten public health.","Seddek, Ahmed; Annamalai, Thirunavukkarasu; Tse-Dinh, Yuk-Ching",Microorganisms,441,1

However, information on kidney damage in older patients with COVID-19 is limited. Acute kidney injury (AKI) is common in hospitalized adults and associated with poor prognosis. We sought to explore the association between AKI and mortality in older patients with COVID-19. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective, observational cohort study in a large tertiary care university hospital in Wuhan, China. All consecutive inpatients older than 65 years with COVID-19 were enrolled in this cohort. Demographic data, laboratory values, comorbidities, treatments, and clinical outcomes were all collected. Data were compared between patients with AKI and without AKI. The association between AKI and mortality was analyzed. RESULTS: Of 1764 in-hospital patients, 882 older adult cases were included in this cohort. The median age was 71 years (interquartile range: 68–77), 440 (49.9%) were men. The most presented comorbidity was cardiovascular diseases (58.2%), followed by diabetes (31.4%). Of 882 older patients, 115 (13%) developed AKI and 128 (14.5%) died. Patients with AKI had higher mortality than those without AKI (68 [59.1%] vs 60 [7.8%]; p < .001). Multivariable Cox regression analysis showed that increasing odds of in-hospital mortality are associated with higher interleukin-6 on admission, myocardial injury, and AKI. CONCLUSIONS: Acute kidney injury is not an uncommon complication in older patients with COVID-19 but is associated with a high risk of death. Physicians should be aware of the risk of AKI in older patients with COVID-19.","Yan, Qi; Zuo, Peiyuan; Cheng, Ling; Li, Yuanyuan; Song, Kaixin; Chen, Yuting; Dai, Yue; Yang, Yi; Zhou, Lun; Yu, Weiwei; Li, Yongsheng; Xie, Min; Zhang, Cuntai; Gao, Hongyu",J Gerontol A Biol Sci Med Sci,441,23
