579,579,579,Rhinovirus Genome Variation during Chronic Upper and Lower Respiratory Tract Infections,13.028757,9.295578,2011-06-21,"Routine screening of lung transplant recipients and hospital patients for respiratory virus infections allowed to identify human rhinovirus (HRV) in the upper and lower respiratory tracts, including immunocompromised hosts chronically infected with the same strain over weeks or months. Phylogenetic analysis of 144 HRV-positive samples showed no apparent correlation between a given viral genotype or species and their ability to invade the lower respiratory tract or lead to protracted infection. By contrast, protracted infections were found almost exclusively in immunocompromised patients, thus suggesting that host factors rather than the virus genotype modulate disease outcome, in particular the immune response. Complete genome sequencing of five chronic cases to study rhinovirus genome adaptation showed that the calculated mutation frequency was in the range observed during acute human infections. Analysis of mutation hot spot regions between specimens collected at different times or in different body sites revealed that non-synonymous changes were mostly concentrated in the viral capsid genes VP1, VP2 and VP3, independent of the HRV type. In an immunosuppressed lung transplant recipient infected with the same HRV strain for more than two years, both classical and ultra-deep sequencing of samples collected at different time points in the upper and lower respiratory tracts showed that these virus populations were phylogenetically indistinguishable over the course of infection, except for the last month. Specific signatures were found in the last two lower respiratory tract populations, including changes in the 5′UTR polypyrimidine tract and the VP2 immunogenic site 2. These results highlight for the first time the ability of a given rhinovirus to evolve in the course of a natural infection in immunocompromised patients and complement data obtained from previous experimental inoculation studies in immunocompetent volunteers.","Tapparel, Caroline; Cordey, Samuel; Junier, Thomas; Farinelli, Laurent; Van Belle, Sandra; Soccal, Paola M.; Aubert, John-David; Zdobnov, Evgeny; Kaiser, Laurent",PLoS One,213,1

The ability of influenza vaccines to elicit CD4(+) T cells and the relationship between induction of CD4(+) T cells and vaccine-induced neutralizing antibody responses has been controversial. The emergence of swine-origin 2009 pandemic influenza A virus subtype H1N1 (A[H1N1]pdm09) provided a unique opportunity to examine responses to an influenza vaccine composed of both novel and previously encountered antigens and to probe the relationship between B-cell and T-cell responses to vaccination. Methods. We tracked CD4(+) T-cell and antibody responses of human subjects vaccinated with monovalent subunit A(H1N1)pdm09 vaccine. The specificity and magnitude of the CD4(+) T-cell response was evaluated using cytokine enzyme-linked immunosorbent spot assays in conjugation with peptide pools representing distinct influenza virus proteins. Results. Our studies revealed that vaccination induced readily detectable CD4(+) T cells specific for conserved portions of hemagglutinin (HA) and the internal viral proteins. Interestingly, expansion of HA-specific CD4(+) T cells was most tightly correlated with the antibody response. Conclusions. These results indicate that CD4(+) T-cell expansion may be a limiting factor in development of neutralizing antibody responses to pandemic influenza vaccines and suggest that approaches to facilitate CD4(+) T-cell recruitment may increase the neutralizing antibody produced in response to vaccines against novel influenza strains.","Nayak, Jennifer L.; Fitzgerald, Theresa F.; Richards, Katherine A.; Yang, Hongmei; Treanor, John J.; Sant, Andrea J.",J Infect Dis,213,3
1186,1186,1186,Identification of Recombinant Human Rhinovirus A and C in Circulating Strains from Upper and Lower Respiratory Infections,12.731971,9.199102,2013-06-27,"Human rhinoviruses (HRVs), in the Enterovirus genus within the family Picornaviridae, are a highly prevalent cause of acute respiratory infection (ARI). Enteroviruses are genetically highly variable, and recombination between serotypes is known to be a major contribution to their diversity. Recently it was reported that recombination events in HRVs cause the diversity of HRV-C. This study analyzed parts of the viral genes spanning the 5′ non- coding region (NCR) through to the viral protein (VP) encoding sequences of 105 HRV field isolates from 51 outpatient cases of Acute Respiratory Infectious Network (ARINET) and 54 inpatient cases of severe lower respiratory infection (SLRI) surveillance, in order to identify recombination in field samples. When analyzing parts of the 5′NCR and VP4/VP2 encoding sequences, we found intra- and interspecies recombinants in field strains of HRV-A and -C. Nineteen cases of recombination events (18.1%) were found among 105 field strains. For HRV-A, there were five cases (4.8%) of intraspecies recombination events and three cases (2.8%) of interspecies recombination events. For HRV-C, there were four cases (3.8%) of intraspecies recombination events and seven cases (6.7%) of interspecies recombination events. Recombination events were significantly more frequently observed in the ARINET samples (18 cases) than in the SLRI samples (1 case; P< 0.0001). The recombination breakpoints were located in nucleotides (nt) 472–554, which comprise stem-loop 5 in the internal ribosomal entry site (IRES), based on the HRV-B 35 sequence (accession no. FJ445187). Our findings regarding genomic recombination in circulating HRV-A and -C strains suggest that recombination might play a role in HRV fitness and could be a possible determinant of disease severity caused by various HRV infections in patients with ARI.","Kim, Hak; Kim, Kisoon; Kim, Dae-Won; Jung, Hee-Dong; Min Cheong, Hyang; Kim, Ki Hwan; Soo Kim, Dong; Kim, You-Jin",PLoS One,213,11
1333,1333,1333,The Natural History of Influenza Infection in the Severely Immunocompromised vs Nonimmunocompromised Hosts,12.8404455,9.1395645,2013-11-01,"Introduction. Medical advances have led to an increase in the world's population of immunosuppressed individuals. The most severely immunocompromised patients are those who have been diagnosed with a hematologic malignancy, solid organ tumor, or who have other conditions that require immunosuppressive therapies and/or solid organ or stem cell transplants. Materials and methods. Medically attended patients with a positive clinical diagnosis of influenza were recruited prospectively and clinically evaluated. Nasal washes and serum were collected. Evaluation of viral shedding, nasal and serum cytokines, clinical illness, and clinical outcomes were performed to compare severely immunocompromised individuals to nonimmunocompromised individuals with influenza infection. Results. Immunocompromised patients with influenza had more severe disease/complications, longer viral shedding, and more antiviral resistance while demonstrating less clinical symptoms and signs on clinical assessment. Conclusions. Immunocompromised patients are at risk for more severe or complicated influenza induced disease, which may be difficult to prevent with existing vaccines and antiviral treatments. Specific issues to consider when managing a severely immunocompromised host include the development of asymptomatic shedding, multi-drug resistance during prolonged antiviral therapy, and the potential high risk of pulmonary involvement.

Since 2001, when Human metapneumovirus (HMPV) was isolated in the Netherlands, the virus has been detected in several continents. Although reports have confirmed the prevalence of HMPV worldwide, data from Egypt remain limited. HMPV plays an important role in respiratory tract infections in individuals of all ages particularly in children. This study was aimed at estimating the prevalence of HMPV in patients with community-acquired lower respiratory infection in Upper Egypt and characterizing the circulating Egyptian HMPV strains for the first time. Materials and Methods. From 2005 to 2008, respiratory samples from 520 patients were analyzed for the presence of HMPV by real-time RT-PCR. Molecular and phylogenetic analyses were performed on partial fusion gene sequences of HMPV-positive patients. Results. HMPV-positive patients were detected in 2007-2008. The overall infection rate was 4%, while 57% of the patients were children. Sequence analysis demonstrated circulation of subgroup B viruses with predominance of lineage B2. Nucleotide sequence identity within lineage B1 was 98.8%–99.7% and higher than that in lineage B2 (94.3%–100%). Three new amino acid substitutions (T223N, R229K, and D280N) of lineage B2 were observed. Conclusion. HMPV is a major viral pathogen in the Egyptian population especially in children. During 2007-2008, predominantly HMPV B2 circulated in Upper Egypt.","Embarek Mohamed, Mona S.; Reiche, Janine; Jacobsen, Sonja; Thabit, Amany G.; Badary, Mohamed S.; Brune, Wolfram; Schweiger, Brunhilde; Osmann, Ahmed H.",Int J Microbiol,213,11
1529,1529,1529,Outcomes of Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 Virus Infection: Results from Two International Cohort Studies,12.745296,8.838415,2014-07-08,"BACKGROUND: Data from prospectively planned cohort studies on risk of major clinical outcomes and prognostic factors for patients with influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus are limited. In 2009, in order to assess outcomes and evaluate risk factors for progression of illness, two cohort studies were initiated: FLU 002 in outpatients and FLU 003 in hospitalized patients. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Between October 2009 and December 2012, adults with influenza-like illness (ILI) were enrolled; outpatients were followed for 14 days and inpatients for 60 days. Disease progression was defined as hospitalization and/or death for outpatients, and hospitalization for >28 days, transfer to intensive care unit (ICU) if enrolled from general ward, and/or death for inpatients. Infection was confirmed by RT-PCR. 590 FLU 002 and 392 FLU 003 patients with influenza A (H1N1)pdm09 were enrolled from 81 sites in 17 countries at 2 days (IQR 1–3) and 6 days (IQR 4–10) following ILI onset, respectively. Disease progression was experienced by 29 (1 death) outpatients (5.1%; 95% CI: 3.4–7.2%) and 80 inpatients [death (32), hospitalization >28 days (43) or ICU transfer (20)] (21.6%; 95% CI: 17.5–26.2%). Disease progression (death) for hospitalized patients was 53.1% (26.6%) and 12.8% (3.8%), respectively, for those enrolled in the ICU and general ward. In pooled analyses for both studies, predictors of disease progression were age, longer duration of symptoms at enrollment and immunosuppression. Patients hospitalized during the pandemic period had a poorer prognosis than in subsequent seasons. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with influenza A(H1N1)pdm09, particularly when requiring hospital admission, are at high risk for disease progression, especially if they are older, immunodeficient, or admitted late in infection. These data reinforce the need for international trials of novel treatment strategies for influenza infection and serve as a reminder of the need to monitor the severity of seasonal and pandemic influenza epidemics globally.

1602,1602,1602,Leukemia inhibitory factor protects the lung during respiratory syncytial viral infection,13.032999,8.934455,2014-10-03,"BACKGROUND: Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infects the lung epithelium where it stimulates the production of numerous host cytokines that are associated with disease burden and acute lung injury. Characterizing the host cytokine response to RSV infection, the regulation of host cytokines and the impact of neutralizing an RSV-inducible cytokine during infection were undertaken in this study. METHODS: A549, primary human small airway epithelial (SAE) cells and wild-type, TIR-domain-containing adapter-inducing interferon-β (Trif) and mitochondrial antiviral-signaling protein (Mavs) knockout (KO) mice were infected with RSV and cytokine responses were investigated by ELISA, multiplex analysis and qPCR. Neutralizing anti-leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) IgG or control IgG was administered to a group of wild-type animals prior to RSV infection. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: RSV-infected A549 and SAE cells release a network of cytokines, including newly identified RSV-inducible cytokines LIF, migration inhibitory factor (MIF), stem cell factor (SCF), CCL27, CXCL12 and stem cell growth factor beta (SCGF-β). These RSV-inducible cytokines were also observed in the airways of mice during an infection. To identify the regulation of RSV inducible cytokines, Mavs and Trif deficient animals were infected with RSV. In vivo induction of airway IL-1β, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-12(p40), IFN-γ, CCL2, CCL5, CCL3, CXCL1, IP-10/CXCL10, IL-22, MIG/CXCL9 and MIF were dependent on Mavs expression in mice. Loss of Trif expression in mice altered the RSV induction of IL-1β, IL-5, CXCL12, MIF, LIF, CXCL12 and IFN-γ. Silencing of retinoic acid–inducible gene-1 (RIG-I) expression in A549 cells had a greater impact on RSV-inducible cytokines than melanoma differentiation-associated protein 5 (MDA5) and laboratory of genetics and physiology 2 (LGP2), and Trif expression. To evaluate the role of LIF in the airways during RSV infection, animals were treated with neutralizing anti-LIF IgG, which enhanced RSV pathology observed with increased airspace protein content, apoptosis and airway hyperresponsiveness compared to control IgG treatment. CONCLUSIONS: RSV infection in the epithelium induces a network of immune factors to counter infection, primarily in a RIG-I dependent manner. Expression of LIF protects the lung from lung injury and enhanced pathology during RSV infection.

1652,1652,1652,Silencing airway epithelial cell-derived hepcidin exacerbates sepsis-induced acute lung injury,13.065242,9.15351,2014-08-06,"INTRODUCTION: The production of antimicrobial peptides by airway epithelial cells is an important component of the innate immune response to pulmonary infection and inflammation. Hepcidin is a β-defensin-like antimicrobial peptide and acts as a principal iron regulatory hormone. Hepcidin is mostly produced by hepatocytes, but is also expressed by other cells, such as airway epithelial cells. However, nothing is known about its function in lung infections and inflammatory diseases. We therefore sought to investigate the role of airway epithelial cell-derived hepcidin in sepsis-induced acute lung injury. METHODS: Acute lung injury was induced by polymicrobial sepsis via cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) surgery. Adenovirus-mediated short hairpin RNA specific for the mouse hepcidin gene hepc1 and control adenovirus were intratracheally injected into mice. The adenovirus-mediated knockdown of hepcidin in airway epithelial cells was evaluated in vivo. Lung injury and the seven-day survival rate were assessed. The levels of hepcidin-related iron export protein ferroportin were measured, and the iron content and function of alveolar macrophages were evaluated. RESULTS: The hepcidin level in airway epithelial cells was upregulated during polymicrobial sepsis. The knockdown of airway epithelial cell-derived hepcidin aggravated the polymicrobial sepsis-induced lung injury and pulmonary bacterial infection and increased mortality (53.33% in Ad-shHepc1-treated mice versus 12.5% in Ad-shNeg-treated mice, P <0.05). The knockdown of hepcidin in airway epithelial cells also led to reduced ferroportin degradation and a low intracellular iron content in alveolar macrophages. Moreover, alveolar macrophages form the airway epithelial cell-derived hepcidin knockdown mice showed impaired phagocytic ability than those from the control mice. CONCLUSIONS: Airway epithelial cell-derived hepcidin plays an important role in CLP-induced acute lung injury. The severe lung injury in the airway epithelial cell-derived hepcidin knockdown mice is at least partially related to the altered intracellular iron level and function of alveolar macrophages.","Chen, Qi Xing; Song, Sheng Wen; Chen, Qing Hua; Zeng, Cong Li; Zheng, Xia; Wang, Jun Lu; Fang, Xiang Ming",Crit Care,213,8
1655,1655,1655,Comparison of Contact Patterns Relevant for Transmission of Respiratory Pathogens in Thailand and the Netherlands Using Respondent-Driven Sampling,12.875105,8.79217,2014-11-25,"Understanding infection dynamics of respiratory diseases requires the identification and quantification of behavioural, social and environmental factors that permit the transmission of these infections between humans. Little empirical information is available about contact patterns within real-world social networks, let alone on differences in these contact networks between populations that differ considerably on a socio-cultural level. Here we compared contact network data that were collected in the Netherlands and Thailand using a similar online respondent-driven method. By asking participants to recruit contact persons we studied network links relevant for the transmission of respiratory infections. We studied correlations between recruiter and recruited contacts to investigate mixing patterns in the observed social network components. In both countries, mixing patterns were assortative by demographic variables and random by total numbers of contacts. However, in Thailand participants reported overall more contacts which resulted in higher effective contact rates. Our findings provide new insights on numbers of contacts and mixing patterns in two different populations. These data could be used to improve parameterisation of mathematical models used to design control strategies. Although the spread of infections through populations depends on more factors, found similarities suggest that spread may be similar in the Netherlands and Thailand.","Stein, Mart L.; van Steenbergen, Jim E.; Buskens, Vincent; van der Heijden, Peter G.

Exposure to live poultry is a risk factor for H7N9 infection. Public psychobehavioral responses often change during progression of an epidemic. METHODS: We conducted population-based surveys in southern China to examine human exposure to live poultry, and population psychological response and behavioral changes in the two waves. In Guangzhou, an urban area of Guangdong province, we collected data using telephone surveys with random digit dialing in May-June 2013 and again in December 2013 to January 2014. In Zijin county, a rural area of the same province, we used door-to-door surveys under a stratified sampling design in July 2013 and again in December 2013 to January 2014. All responses were weighted by age and sex to the respective adult populations. FINDINGS: Around half of the urban respondents (53.8%) reported having visited LPMs in the previous year in the first survey, around double that reported in the second survey (27.7%). In the rural surveys, around half of the participants reported raising backyard poultry in the past year in the first survey, increasing to 83.2% participants in the second survey. One third of urban subjects supported the permanent closure of LPMs in the first and second surveys, and factors associated with support for closure included female sex, higher level of worry towards H7N9, and worry induced by a hypothetical influenza-like illness. CONCLUSIONS: Our study indicated high human exposure to live poultry and low support for permanent closure of markets in both urban and rural residents regardless of increased worry during the epidemic.","Wu, Peng; Wang, Liping; Cowling, Benjamin J.; Yu, Jianxing; Fang, Vicky J.; Li, Fu; Zeng, Lingjia; Wu, Joseph T.; Li, Zhongjie; Leung, Gabriel M.; Yu, Hongjie",PLoS One,213,1
2342,2342,2342,Interferon Regulatory Factor-1 Mediates Alveolar Macrophage Pyroptosis During LPS-Induced Acute Lung Injury in Mice,12.738532,9.096496,2016-08-15,"Previously, we demonstrated that pyroptosis in alveolar macrophages (AMs) plays an essential role in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced acute lung injury. However, the underlying mechanism remains largely unclear. Here, we show that the absence of interferon regulatory factor 1 (IRF-1) in genetic knock-out mice strongly abrogates pyroptosis in AMs and alleviates the LPS-induced lung injury and systemic inflammation. Our study demonstrates that IRF-1 contributes to caspase-1 activation and apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a caspase activation and recruitment domain pyroptosome formation in AMs and leads to downstream inflammatory cytokine release, including that of IL-1β, IL-18, and HMGB1. The nuclear translocation of IRF-1 is linked to the presence of toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4). Our findings suggest that pyroptosis and the downstream inflammatory response in AMs induced by LPS is a process that is dependent on TLR4-mediated up-regulation of IRF-1. In summary, IRF-1 plays a key role in controlling caspase-1-dependent pyroptosis and inflammation.","Wu, Dongdong; Pan, Pinhua; Su, Xiaoli; Zhang, Lemeng; Qin, Qingwu; Tan, Hongyi; Huang, Li; Li, Yuanyuan",Shock,213,1

METHODS: Based on the fact that postnatal regeneration of alveolar tissue has been attributed to alveolar epithelial cells, we established a hemorrhagic shock and Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) lung injury model. Using this model, we analyzed the cellular kinetics of lung alveolar epithelial cells. RESULTS: The results showed that alveolar epithelium type 2 cells (AEC2s) are damage resistant during acute lung injury, they might be the main cells involved in lung injury and repair. Then we observed the relationship between the expression of HGF, c-Met following ALI in rat lung and proliferation of AEC2s. The proliferation of AEC2s was inhibited when isolated primary AEC2s were co-cultured with c-Met inhibitor SU11274. Furthermore, the numbers of AEC2s was significantly decreased when ALI rats were administrated with SU11274 in vivo. It provided further evidence that the HGF/c-Met signaling plays a vital role in ALI-induced AEC2s proliferation. CONCLUSIONS: AEC2s are damage resistant during acute lung injury and the HGF/c-Met signaling pathway is of vital importance in the proliferation of AEC2s after ALI.","Zeng, Ling; Yang, Xue-tao; Li, Hai-sheng; Li, Yong; Yang, Ce; Gu, Wei; Zhou, Yin-han; Du, Juan; Wang, Hai-yan; Sun, Jian-hui; Wen, Da-lin; Jiang, Jian-xin",Respir Res,213,1

METHOD: Acute lung injury was induced in Sprague-Dawley rats by intraperitoneal injection with LPS (5 mg/kg), followed by immediate intratracheal instillation of siRNA targeting NF-κB p65 (40 μg/ml). Animals in each group were sacrificed at 1 h or 8 h after the instillation. Pulmonary histological changes were evaluated by hematoxylin-eosin staining. The levels of NF-κB and TNF-α were measured by qRT-PCR. Expressions of NF-κB in lung cells and TNF-α in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) were determined by western blot analysis and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) respectively. RESULTS: LPS administration reduced the rectal temperature and white blood cell counts at 1 h, increased lung wet/dry weight ratios, caused evident lung histopathological injury, and increased the detectable transcript and cytokine levels of TNF-α in lung tissue in BALF. siRNA targeting of NF-κB p65 effectively abrogated the expression of NF-κB p65 in lung cells and, aside from rectal temperatures, ameliorated all changes induced by LPS. CONCLUSIONS: NF-κB knockdown exerts anti-inflammatory effects on LPS-induced ALI especially in the initial phase, which may be due in part to reduced levels of the proinflammatory cytokine TNF-α. NF-κB siRNA’s rapidity and effectiveness to abrogate ALI development may provide an effective therapeutic method with future clinical applications.","Li, Ning; Song, Yuanbin; Zhao, Wei; Han, Tingting; Lin, Shuhui; Ramirez, Oscar; Liang, Li",BMC Physiol,213,1

Host genetic variability is an important determinant of the risk of developing TB in humans. Although the association between MBL polymorphisms and TB has been studied in various populations, the results are controversial. The aim of this study was to investigate mannose-binding lectin (MBL) gene polymorphisms with susceptibility to pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) in a Lur population of Iran. METHODS: In this case-control study, four functional MBL gene polymorphisms (HL, XY, PQ and AB) were genotyped by using PCR Single Strand Conformation Polymorphism (SSCP) technique in a Lur population living in Lorestan Province, consisting of 100 patients with pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) age and sex matched 100 healthy controls (HCs). Association analyses were performed with the SPSS 21 statistical software. RESULTS: We found that MBL (HH) genotype polymorphism significantly was associated with increased susceptibility to TB (35% in patients vs. 22% in controls, P = 0.0417, OR = 1.909, %95 CI = 1.020–3.573). Additionally, H allele showed a significant association with increased risk of TB (56.5% in patients vs. 46% in controls, P = 0.0357, OR = 1.525, %95 CI = 1.028–2.262). Also, the distribution of L allele in patients was significantly lower frequency in TB patients compared to controls (43.5% vs. 54%, P = 0.0357, OR = 0.656, %95 CI = 0.442–0.973). However, the allelic and genotypic frequencies of AB, XY and PQ polymorphisms were not significantly different between the patients and the controls. We couldn't detect any significant differences between haplotypes among TB patients and healthy controls. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings demonstrated that HH genotype and H allele may increase the susceptibility to pulmonary TB in the Lur population of Iran, although L allele may decrease the susceptibility to pulmonary TB in this population. We suggest that it is necessary to further more studies with larger sample size and other ethnic population.","Amiri, Ali; Sabooteh, Toomaj; Shahsavar, Farhad; Anbari, Khatereh; Pouremadi, Flora",Genom Data,213,1

Using a comprehensive series of protein-ligand biochemical assays, we sought to determine whether BNeV recognizes cell surface HBGAs and/or SAs as attachment factors. It was found that BNeV virus-like particles (VLPs) bound to A type/H type 2/Le(y) HBGAs expressed in the bovine digestive tract and are related to HBGAs expressed in humans and other host species, suggesting a wide spectrum of HBGA recognition by BNeV. BNeV VLPs also bound to a large variety of different bovine and human saliva samples of all ABH and Lewis types, supporting previously obtained results and suggesting a zoonotic potential of BNeV transmission. Removal of α1,2-linked fucose and α1,3/4-linked fucose epitopes of target HBGAs by confirmation-specific enzymes reduced the binding of BNeV VLPs to synthetic HBGAs, bovine and human saliva, cultured cell lines, and bovine small intestine mucosa, further supporting a wide HBGA binding spectrum of BNeV through recognition of α1,2-linked fucose and α1,3/4-linked fucose epitopes of targeted HBGAs. However, removal of terminal α2,3- and α2,6-linked SAs by their specific enzyme had no inhibitory effects on binding of BNeV VLPs, indicating that BNeV does not use terminal SAs as attachment factors. Further details of the binding specificity of BNeV remain to be explored. IMPORTANCE Enteric caliciviruses such as noroviruses, sapoviruses, and recoviruses are the most important etiological agents of severe acute gastroenteritis in humans and many other mammalian host species. They initiate infection by attachment to cell surface carbohydrate moieties, HBGAs, and/or terminal SAs. However, the attachment factor(s) for BNeV, a recently classified enteric calicivirus genus/type species, remains unexplored. Here, we demonstrate that BNeV VLPs have a wide spectrum of binding to synthetic HBGAs, bovine and human saliva samples, and bovine duodenal sections. We further discovered that α1,2-linked fucose and α1,3/4-linked fucose epitopes are essential for binding of BNeV VLPs. However, BNeV VLPs do not bind to terminal SAs on cell carbohydrates. Continued investigation regarding the proteinaceous receptor(s) will be necessary for better understanding of the tropism, pathogenesis, and host range of this important viral genus.","Cho, Eun-Hyo; Soliman, Mahmoud; Alfajaro, Mia Madel; Kim, Ji-Yun; Seo, Ja-Young; Park, Jun-Gyu; Kim, Deok-Song; Baek, Yeong-Bin; Kang, Mun-Il; Park, Sang-Ik; Le Pendu, Jacques; Cho, Kyoung-Oh",J Virol,213,1

Nipah virus can be transmitted via person-to-person contact, posing a high risk for epidemic outbreaks. However, a broadly applicable approach for human NiV outbreaks in field settings is lacking. METHODS: We engineered new antiviral lipopeptides and analyzed in vitro fusion inhibition to identify an optimal candidate for prophylaxis of NiV infection in the lower respiratory tract, and we assessed antiviral efficiency in 2 different animal models. RESULTS: We show that lethal NiV infection can be prevented with lipopeptides delivered via the respiratory route in both hamsters and nonhuman primates. By targeting retention of peptides for NiV prophylaxis in the respiratory tract, we avoid its systemic delivery in individuals who need only prevention, and thus we increase the safety of treatment and enhance utility of the intervention. CONCLUSIONS: The experiments provide a proof of concept for the use of antifusion lipopeptides for prophylaxis of lethal NiV. These results advance the goal of rational development of potent lipopeptide inhibitors with desirable pharmacokinetic and biodistribution properties and a safe effective delivery method to target NiV and other pathogenic viruses.","Mathieu, Cyrille; Porotto, Matteo; Figueira, Tiago N; Horvat, Branka; Moscona, Anne",The Journal of Infectious Diseases,213,28

This increased burden of viral respiratory infections is likely to have long term implications for lung health and function in individuals born preterm, particularly those with bronchopulmonary dysplasia. Several hypotheses have been put forward to explain the association between early life viral respiratory infection and development of suboptimal lung health and function later in life following preterm birth. Although preterm infants with diminished lung function, particularly small airways, might be particularly susceptible to asthma and wheezing disorders following viral infection, there is evidence that respiratory viruses can activate number of inflammatory and airway re-modelling pathways. Therefore, the aim of this review is to highlight the perinatal and early life risk factors that may contribute to increased susceptibility to viral respiratory infections among preterm infants during early life and to understand how respiratory viral infection may influence the development of abnormal lung health and function later in life.","Townsi, Nada; Laing, Ingrid A.; Hall, Graham L.; Simpson, Shannon J.",Eur Clin Respir J,213,5

One key player is the ubiquitously expressed serine protease furin, which cleaves a plethora of proteins at polybasic recognition motifs. Mammalian substrates of furin include cytokines, hormones, growth factors and receptors. Thus, it is not surprising that aberrant furin activity is associated with a variety of disorders including cancer. Furthermore, the enzymatic activity of furin is exploited by numerous viral and bacterial pathogens, thereby enhancing their virulence and spread. In this review, we describe the physiological and pathophysiological substrates of furin and discuss how dysregulation of a simple proteolytic cleavage event may promote infectious diseases and cancer. One major focus is the role of furin in viral glycoprotein maturation and pathogenicity. We also outline cellular mechanisms regulating the expression and activation of furin and summarise current approaches that target this protease for therapeutic intervention.","Braun, Elisabeth; Sauter, Daniel",Clin Transl Immunology,213,1

In this study, we investigated the therapeutic effects of galloyl-hexahydroxydiphenoyl (HHDP)-glucose isolated from pomegranate leaves on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced acute lung injury (ALI) in mice. Male BALB/c mice were treated with different doses of galloyl-HHDP-glucose (5, 50, and 100 mg/Kg) or dexamethasone at 5 mg/Kg (per os) 6 h after intra-tracheal instillation of LPS. Vehicle-treated mice were used as controls. Twenty-four hours after LPS challenge, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF), and lung samples were collected for analyses. They were evaluated by monitoring the expression of NF-κB, JNK, and cytokine genes and proteins, as well as cell migration and lung function. All doses of galloyl-HHDP-glucose inhibited LPS-induced JNK and NF-κB activation. Likewise, the galloyl-HHDP-glucose-treated animals presented reduced expression of the TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-1β genes in the lungs and reduced TNF-α, IL-6, IL-1β, and IL-8 protein levels when compared with the vehicle-treated LPS-challenged mice. In addition, the ALI mice treated with galloyl-HHDP-glucose also presented reduced lung inflammatory cell accumulation, especially that of neutrophils, in their BALF and lungs. In addition, galloyl-HHDP-glucose treatment markedly ameliorated the LPS-induced pulmonary mechanism complications and attenuated weight loss. Overall, we showed for the first time that galloyl-HHDP-glucose protects against ALI, and may be useful for treating ALI and other inflammatory disorders.","Pinheiro, Aruanã Joaquim Matheus Costa Rodrigues; Mendes, Aleff Ricardo Santos; Neves, Milena Dara Farias de Jesus; Prado, Carla Máximo; Bittencourt-Mernak, Márcia Isabel; Santana, Fernanda Paula Roncon; Lago, João Henrique G.; de Sá, Joicy Cortez; da Rocha, Claudia Quintino; de Sousa, Eduardo Martins; Fontes, Valéria Costa; Grisoto, Marco Augusto Gregolin; Falcai, Angela; Lima-Neto, Lidio Gonçalves",Front Immunol,213,1

Previous studies on other respiratory viruses have shown that several host cytokines correlate with duration of hospitalisation, but this has yet to be investigated in children with RV-C infection. We determined the nasal cytokine profiles of these children and investigated their relationship with RV-C load and clinical outcome. Flocked nasal swabs were collected from children aged 24–72 months presenting to the Emergency Department at Princess Margaret Hospital with a clinical diagnosis of acute wheeze and an acute upper respiratory tract viral infection. RV-C load was determined by quantitative RT-PCR and cytokine profiles were characterised by a commercial human cytokine 34-plex panel. RV-C was the most commonly detected virus in pre-school-aged children hospitalised with an episodic wheeze. RV-C load did not significantly differ between asthmatic and non-asthmatic patients. Both groups showed a Th2-based cytokine profile. However, Th17 response cytokines IL-17 and IL-1β were only elevated in RV-C-infected children with pre-existing asthma. Neither RV-C load nor any specific cytokines were associated illness severity in this study. Medically attended RV-C-induced wheeze is characterised by a Th2 inflammatory pattern, independent of viral load. Any therapeutic interventions should be aimed at modulating the host response following infection.","Sikazwe, Chisha T.; Laing, Ingrid A.; Imrie, Allison; Smith, David W.",Viruses,213,1
4328,4328,4328,Antiviral immunity is impaired in COPD patients with frequent exacerbations,12.887461,8.82731,2019-12-01,Patients with frequent exacerbations represent a chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) subgroup requiring better treatment options. The aim of this study was to determine the innate immune mechanisms that underlie susceptibility to frequent exacerbations in COPD. We measured sputum expression of immune mediators and bacterial loads in samples from patients with COPD at stable state and during virus-associated exacerbations. In vitro immune responses to rhinovirus infection in differentiated primary bronchial epithelial cells (BECs) sampled from patients with COPD were additionally evaluated. Patients were stratified as frequent exacerbators (≥2 exacerbations in the preceding year) or infrequent exacerbators (<2 exacerbations in the preceding year) with comparisons made between these groups. Frequent exacerbators had reduced sputum cell mRNA expression of the antiviral immune mediators type I and III interferons and reduced interferon-stimulated gene (ISG) expression when clinically stable and during virus-associated exacerbation. A role for epithelial cell-intrinsic innate immune dysregulation was identified: induction of interferons and ISGs during in vitro rhinovirus (RV) infection was also impaired in differentiated BECs from frequent exacerbators. Frequent exacerbators additionally had increased sputum bacterial loads at 2 wk following virus-associated exacerbation onset. These data implicate deficient airway innate immunity involving epithelial cells in the increased propensity to exacerbations observed in some patients with COPD. Therapeutic approaches to boost innate antimicrobial immunity in the lung could be a viable strategy for prevention and treatment of frequent exacerbations.,"Singanayagam, Aran; Loo, Su-Ling; Calderazzo, Maria; Finney, Lydia J.; Trujillo Torralbo, Maria-Belen; Bakhsoliani, Eteri; Girkin, Jason; Veerati, Punnam; Pathinayake, Prabuddha S.; Nichol, Kristy S.; Reid, Andrew; Footitt, Joseph; Wark, Peter A.

The genomic RNA of CCHFV is enwrapped by its nucleoprotein. Positively charged residues on CCHFV nucleoprotein provide multiple binding sites to facilitate genomic RNA encapsidation. In the present work, we investigated the mechanism underlying preferential packaging of the negative sense genomic RNA by CCHFV nucleoprotein in the presence of host cell RNAs during viral assembly. The work included genome sequence analyses for different families of negative and positive sense RNA viruses, using serial docking experiments and molecular dynamic simulations. Our results indicated that the main determinant parameter of the nucleoprotein binding affinity for negative sense RNA is the ratio of purine/pyrimidine in the RNA molecule. A negative sense RNA with a purine/pyrimidine ratio (>1) higher than that of a positive sense RNA (<1) exhibits higher affinity for the nucleoprotein. Our calculations revealed that a negative sense RNA expresses about 0.5 kJ/mol higher binding energy per nucleotide compared to a positive sense RNA. This energy difference produces a binding energy high enough to make the negative sense RNA, the preferred substrate for packaging by CCHFV nucleoprotein in the presence of cellular or complementary positive sense RNAs. The outcome of this study may contribute to ongoing researches on other viral diseases caused by negative sense RNA viruses such as Ebola virus which poses a security threat to all humanity.","Dayer, Mohammad Reza; Dayer, Mohammad Saaid; Rezatofighi, Seyedeh Elham",Protein J,213,1

Because the MDS–AL risk has also been shown to be associated with exposure to GCSF, since 2005, in France, patients receiving high daily GCSF doses (>15 μg/kg/day) are eligible for HSCT, in addition to classic indications (MDS–AL or GCSF refractoriness). We analyzed the effect of this policy. Among 144 prospectively followed ELANE-neutropenia patients enrolled in the French Severe Congenital Neutropenia Registry, we defined two groups according to period: “before 2005” for those born before 2005 and followed until 31/12/2004 (1588 person-years); and “after 2005” comprised of those born after 2005 or born before 2005 but followed after 2005 until 31/03/2019 (1327 person-years). Sixteen of our cohort patients underwent HSCT (14 long-term survivors) and six developed MDS–ALs.

The risk to the small biotech, however, is enormous because the partner may decide to return the rights to the product. This event usually leaves the product in limbo and the technology used to develop it tainted because of uncertainty regarding the real reasons for the return and the assumption in the world at large that there is something wrong with the product/technology.

Methods: Human mast cells were enzymatically dispersed from tonsil and skin tissues. The dispersed cells were then cultured with various stimuli, and tryptase and histamine levels in cell supernatants collected from challenge tubes were measured. Results: PAR‐2 agonist peptide SLIGKV provoked a dose‐dependent release of histamine from skin mast cells. It also induced tryptase release from tonsil mast cells. tc‐LIGRLO appeared less potent than SLIGKV in induction of release of histamine and tryptase. Trypsin was able to induce a “bell” shape increase in tryptase release from tonsil mast cells. It was also able to induce a dose‐dependent release of histamine from both tonsil and skin mast cells. The actions of trypsin on mast cells were inhibited by soy bean trypsin inhibitor (SBTI) or α(1)‐antitrypsin (α(1)‐AT). Time course study revealed that both stimulated tryptase or histamine release initiated within 10 s and reached their peak release between 4 and 6 min. Pretreatment of cells with metabolic inhibitors or pertussis toxin reduced the ability of mast cells to release tryptase or histamine. Conclusion: It was demonstrated that the in vitro tryptase release properties of human tonsil and skin mast cells suggested a novel type of mast cell heterogeneity. The activation of mast cells by PAR‐2 agonists indicated a self‐amplification mechanism of mast cell degranulation.","HE, Shao‐heng; XIE, Hua; FU, Yi‐ling",Acta Pharmacol Sin,213,1

METHODS: The treatment of synchronized ASM cells from asthmatic rats with PKC-specific agonist phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) and antagonist 2-{1-[3-(amidinothio) propyl]-1H-indol-3-yl}-3-(1-methylindol-3-yl) maleimide methanesulfonate salt (Ro31-8220) was followed by the proliferation assay. PKCα and cyclinD1 expressions in ASM cells (ASMC) were detected by RT-PCR and Western blotting. The relation between PKCα and cyclinD1 was assessed by linear regression analysis. The effect of the construct recombinant plasmid pcDNA3.1-antisense cyclinD1 (pcDNA3.1-ascyclinD1) on the proliferation of ASMC was found to be induced by PMA. RESULTS: The data showed phorbol ester-dependent PKCα promoted the proliferation of ASMC. The closely-positive correlation existed between the expression of PKCα and cyclinD1 at the transcriptional (r=0.821, P<0.01) and transla-tional (r=0.940, P<0.01) levels. pcDNA3.1-ascyclinD1 could inhibit the proliferation of ASMC. pcDNA3.1-ascyclinD1 almost completely attenuated the PMA-induced proliferation effect as Ro31-8220+pcDNA3.1.

Thus, in the present study, we evaluated the changes in arterial pressure and gene expression of components of the renin–angiotensin system (RAS) and neuroinflammatory markers in the NTS of rats fed a HFD and treated with either an AT1R blocker or with virus-mediated AT2R overexpression in the NTS. Male Holtzman rats (300–320 g) were fed either a standard rat chow diet (SD) or HFD for 6 weeks before commencing the tests. AT1R blockade in the NTS of HFD-fed rats attenuated the increase in arterial pressure and the impairment of reflex bradycardia, whereas AT2R overexpression in the NTS only improved the baroreflex function. The HFD also increased the hypertensive and decreased the protective axis of the RAS and was associated with neuroinflammation within the NTS. The expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme and neuroinflammatory components, but not AT1R, in the NTS was reduced by AT2R overexpression in this site. Based on these data, AT1R and AT2R in the NTS are differentially involved in the cardiovascular changes induced by a HFD. Chronic inflammation and changes in the RAS in the NTS may also account for the cardiovascular responses observed in HFD-fed rats.","Speretta, Guilherme F.; Ruchaya, Prashant J.; Delbin, Maria A.; Melo, Mariana R.; Li, Hongwei; Menani, José V.; Sumners, Colin; Colombari, Eduardo; Bassi, Mirian; Colombari, Débora S.

New findings contribute to a better understanding of the pathophysiology of sepsis and lead to the development of new therapeutic strategies. The innate immune system, being responsible for the first response to infections, can trigger adaptive immune responses in case the initial response is ineffective. Both arms of the immune system interact with each other, mainly via cell-cell-interactions but also by soluble factors, such as cytokines and chemokines. Two sub-populations of helper T-cells direct both balanced activation and inhibition of the two arms of the immune systems using specific patterns of cytokine release. Results obtained in new animal models of sepsis, taking a progressive growth of bacteria into account, have implied that existing knowledge has to be reanalyzed. The idea of sepsis as a mere “over-reaction to inflammation” has to be abandoned. Various so-called pattern recognition receptors (e.g. toll-like receptors, TLRs, NOD proteins) are located intracellularly or in the plasma membrane of innate immune cells and recognize certain patterns expressed exclusively by extracellular pathogens. Upon receptor engagement, intracellular signaling pathways lead to cellular activation, followed by release of various cytokines and anti-microbial substances. During the course of sepsis a cytokine shift towards increasing immune suppression occurs. The innate immune system also contributes to the migration of leukocytes in inflammed tissue, involving chemokines and adhesion molecules. Leukocytes also secrete the tissue factor leading to formation of thrombin. The environment in sepsis can cause disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), but at the same time thrombin triggers the release of chemokines and adhesion molecules through endothelial cells, which represents a positive feedback mechanism for innate immune responses. New therapeutic strategies for sepsis try to establish a well-balanced immune response. Intervention is accomplished through inhibition of inflammatory cytokines, their receptors or through activation of immunostimulatory responses.","Hörner, C.; Bouchon, A.; Bierhaus, A.; Nawroth, P.

In addition to treatment of the infection, both drugs are effective prophylactically and have been shown to limit spread of infection in close communities, such as families and in nursing homes. No resistant virus strains have been isolated from normal individuals treated with zanamivir. Resistant virus can be isolated from approximately 1% of adults and 5% of paediatric patients with influenza treated with oseltamivir. However, infectivity of mutant viruses is generally compromised. Governments spend millions of dollars on influenza vaccination campaigns; however, once influenza virus is circulating in the community, vaccination cannot limit the spread of disease. A greater promotion of the use of neuraminidase inhibitors for the treatment and prevention of influenza could have a significant impact on limiting its spread. This could result in saving millions of dollars, not only in direct costs associated with medical and hospital care, but also significant savings in indirect costs associated with the loss of productivity at work, school and home environments. For the benefit of all communities, there needs to be a greater awareness of the symptoms of influenza and the efficacy of neuraminidase inhibitors in disease treatment.","McKimm-Breschkin, Jennifer L.",Treat Respir Med,213,1
6520,6520,6520,Acute Motor Axonal Neuropathy Associated with Pandemic H1N1 Influenza A Infection,13.062935,8.998627,2010-04-29,"BACKGROUND: From March to July 2009, influenza A (H1N1) 2009 (H1N1-2009) virus emerged as a major cause of respiratory failure that required mechanical ventilation. A small proportion of patients who had this condition developed severe respiratory failure that was unresponsive to conventional therapeutic interventions. In this report, we describe characteristics, treatment, and outcomes of critically ill patients in Canada who had H1N1-2009 infection and were treated with extracorporeal lung support (ECLS). METHODS: We report the findings of a case series of six patients supported with ECLS who were included in a cohort study of critically ill patients with confirmed H1N1-2009 infection. The patients were treated in Canadian adult and pediatric intensive care units (ICUs) from April 16, 2009 to August 12, 2009. We describe the nested sample treated with ECLS and compare it with the larger sample. RESULTS: During the study period, 168 patients in Canada were admitted to ICUs for severe respiratory failure due to confirmed H1N1-2009 infection. Due to profound hypoxemia unresponsive to conventional therapeutic interventions, six (3.6%) of these patients were treated with ECLS in four ICUs. Four patients were treated with veno-venous pump-driven extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (vv-ECMO), and two patients were treated with pumpless lung assist (NovaLung iLA). The mean duration of support was 15 days. Four of the six patients survived (66.6%), one of the surviving patients was supported with iLA and the other three surviving patients were supported with ECMO. The two deaths were due to multiorgan failure, which occurred while the patients were on ECLS. INTERPRETATION: Extracorporeal lung support may be an effective treatment for patients who have H1N1-2009 infection and refractory hypoxemia. Survival of these patients treated with ECLS is similar to that reported for patients who have acute respiratory distress syndrome of other etiologies and are treated with ECMO.","Freed, Darren H.; Henzler, Dietrich; White, Chris W.; Fowler, Robert; Zarychanski, Ryan; Hutchison, Jamie; Arora, Rakesh C.; Manji, Rizwan A.; Legare, Jean-Francois; Drews, Tanya; Veroukis, Stasa; Kesselman, Murray; Guerguerian, Anne-Marie; Kumar, Anand",Can J Anaesth,213,12

Recent improvements in ventilator technology and availability of nasal and full face masks for infants and children have simplified the use of NIV even in the smallest children. Mainly patients with hypercapnic respiratory failure may benefit from noninvasive ventilation. There is some evidence available that supports the use of NIV in viral bronchiolitis, asthma and acute on chronic respiratory failure in patients with neuromuscular or chronic pulmonary disease. Furthermore, noninvasive ventilation is beneficial during prolonged weaning from invasive ventilation and to treat upper airway obstructions. Children suffering from hypoxic respiratory failure, such as community-acquired pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome do not benefit from NIV. Due to possibly relevant side effects and the possibility of rapid deterioration in gas exchange in failure of NIV, invasive ventilation should be readily available; therefore, treatment with noninvasive ventilation for acute respiratory failure in children should be initiated on the pediatric intensive care ward.","Fuchs, H.; Klotz, D.; Nicolai, T.",Notf Rett Med,213,28

Although hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is the only curative therapy, the outcomes of HSCT for XIAP deficiency remain unsatisfactory compared with those for SLAM-associated protein deficiency and familial HLH. AIM: To investigate the outcomes and adverse events of HSCT for patients with XIAP deficiency, a national survey was conducted. METHODS: A spreadsheet questionnaire was sent to physicians who had provided HSCT treatment for patients with XIAP deficiency in Japan. RESULTS: Up to the end of September 2016, 10 patients with XIAP deficiency had undergone HSCT in Japan, 9 of whom (90%) had survived. All surviving patients had received a fludarabine-based reduced intensity conditioning (RIC) regimen. Although 5 patients developed post-HSCT HLH, 4 of them survived after etoposide administration. In addition, the IBD associated with XIAP deficiency improved remarkably after HSCT in all affected cases. CONCLUSION: The RIC regimen and HLH control might be important factors for successful HSCT outcomes, with improved IBD, in patients with XIAP deficiency.

This study aimed at correlating these polymorphisms to lethal infections during childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). A matched case-control study of 34 patients who died due to infections during ALL treatment and 68 ALL patients without lethal infections was performed. Genomic DNA was isolated from blood smears and specific fragments including the polymorphic site of each gene were amplified. In the total study population, 23/102 (22.5%) of the children carried at least two variant alleles (high-producer haplotype). The variant genotypes were equally distributed between cases and controls [relative risk (RR) 1.17 (CI 0.33–2.22, P = 0.752)]. With regard to infective organisms, no statistically significant differences could be detected between the groups for bacterial infections [RR 1.59 (CI 0.56–4.50), P 0.379]. Patients with a LT-α (10.5 kb/5.5 kb; 5.5 kb/5.5 kb) haplotype, however, seemed to have a significant higher risk of attracting a lethal infection during induction/consolidation chemotherapy (RR 2.98, CI 0.98–9.01, P = 0.05). These results support a role of specific genetic polymorphisms on lethal infections during induction chemotherapy of ALL treatment.","Kidas, Ekaterini; Möricke, Anja; Beier, Rita; Welte, Karl; Schrappe, Martin; Stanulla, Martin; Grigull, Lorenz",Int J Hematol,213,1

Some studies have focused on community–acquired pneumonia (CAP) but only one was conducted in critically ill patients hospitalized in an intensive care unit (ICU). PATIENTS AND METHODS: To determine the diagnostic and prognostic role of PCT in patients admitted in an intensive care unit for severe CAP, 110 patients hospitalized in our unit were prospectively studied. Within 48 hours following ICU admission, PCT serum level was measured with a quantitative method above a threshold value of 0.5 ng/ml. RESULTS: Initially focusing on the diagnostic value of PCT, 20% of the patients had a serum PCT level < 0.5 ng/ml, 30% between 0.5 ng/ml and 2 ng/ml, and 50% ≥ 2 ng/ml. Serum PCT level was higher in microbiologically documented CAP (median = 4.9 ng/ml vs 1.5 ng/ml if no bacteria were found; p = 0.001), but was not predictive of any specific bacterial agent. Concerning the prognostic value, the serum PCT level was higher for bacteremic patients and/or septic shock patients (4.9 ng/ml vs 1.5 ng/ml; p = 0.0003). Moreover, PCT levels were increased in patients who developed, during their ICU stay, infection–related complications (septic shock, multiorgan dysfunction, acute respiratory distress syndrome and disseminated intravascular coagulation). Finally, the initial PCT level was significantly higher in patients who died during the ICU stay (5.6 ng/ml vs 1.5 ng/ml; p < 0.0001). Such a relationship was not found with C–reactive protein (CRP). CONCLUSION: In ICU patients admitted for severe CAP, initial PCT values could be an interesting predictor for complications and mortality.","Boussekey, N.; Leroy, O.; Georges, H.; Devos, P.; d’Escrivan, T.; Guery, B.",Infection,213,1

We first find that the variability difference between homogeneous and heterogeneous networks is very narrow, although the heterogeneous structures can induce the lighter prevalence. Contrary to non-community networks, strong community structures can cause the secondary outbreak of prevalence and two peaks of variability appeared. Especially in the local community, the extraordinarily large variability in early stage of the outbreak makes the prediction of epidemic spreading hard. Importantly, the bridgeness plays a significant role in the predictability, meaning the further distance of the initial seed to the bridgeness, the less accurate the predictability is. Also, we investigate the effect of different disease reaction mechanisms on variability, and find that the different reaction mechanisms will result in the distinct variabilities at the end of epidemic spreading.","Gong, Kai; Tang, Ming; Yang, Hui; Shang, Mingsheng",Chaos,213,20

Achieving this goal seemed inevitable in 1982 when a series of calcium channel blockers were demonstrated to restore the efficacy of chemotherapy agents. A large number of other compounds have since been demonstrated to restore chemotherapeutic sensitivity in cancer cells or tissues. Where do we stand almost three decades since the first reports of ABCB1 inhibition? Unfortunately, in the aftermath of extensive fundamental and clinical research efforts the situation remains gloomy. Only a small handful of compounds have reached late stage clinical trials and none are in routine clinical usage to circumvent chemoresistance. Why has the translation process been so ineffective? One factor is the multifactorial nature of drug resistance inherent to cancer tissues; ABCB1 is not the sole factor. However, expression of ABCB1 remains a significant negative prognostic indicator and is closely associated with poor response to chemotherapy in many cancer types. The main difficulties with restoration of sensitivity to chemotherapy reside with poor properties of the ABCB1 inhibitors: (1) low selectivity to ABCB1, (2) poor potency to inhibit ABCB1, (3) inherent toxicity and/or (4) adverse pharmacokinetic interactions with anticancer drugs. Despite these difficulties, there is a clear requirement for effective inhibitors and to date the strategies for generating such compounds have involved serendipity or simple chemical syntheses. This chapter outlines more sophisticated approaches making use of bioinformatics, combinatorial chemistry and structure informed drug design. Generating a new arsenal of potent and selective ABCB1 inhibitors offers the promise of restoring the efficacy of a key weapon in cancer treatment – chemotherapy.","Crowley, Emily; McDevitt, Christopher A.; Callaghan, Richard",Multi-Drug Resistance in Cancer,213,1

However, the development of immunocompetent cancer mouse models is still necessary for the study and improvement of oncolytic viroimmunotherapies. Here we have studied the antitumor efficacy, immune response, and mechanism of action of a complete murine version of our cellular virotherapy in mouse models of renal adenocarcinoma and melanoma. We used mouse MSCs infected with the mouse oncolytic adenovirus dlE102 (OAd-MSCs). In both models, treatment with OAd-MSCs significantly reduced tumor volumes by 50% and induced a pro-inflammatory tumor microenvironment. Furthermore, treated mice harboring renal adenocarcinoma and melanoma tumors presented increased infiltration of tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), natural killer cells, and tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs). Treated mice also presented lower percentage of TILs expressing programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1)—the major regulator of T cell exhaustion. In conclusion, treatment with OAd-MSCs significantly reduced tumor volume and induced changes in tumor-infiltrating populations of melanoma and renal cancer.","Morales-Molina, Alvaro; Rodríguez-Milla, Miguel Ángel; Gimenez-Sanchez, Alicia; Perisé-Barrios, Ana Judith; García-Castro, Javier",Cancers (Basel),213,3

Previous studies show that EGCG could effectively suppress HBV gene expression and replication, but the role of EGCG in HBV replication and its underlying mechanisms, especially the signaling pathways involved, remain unclear. In this study we investigated the mechanisms underlying EGCG inhibition on HBV replication with a focus on the signaling pathways. We showed that EGCG (12.5−50 μM) dose-dependently inhibited HBV gene expression and replication in HepG2.2.15 cells. Similar results were observed in HBV mice receiving EGCG (25 mg· kg(−1)· d(−1), ip) for 5 days. In HepG2.2.15 cells, we showed that EGCG (12.5−50 μM) significantly activate ERK1/2 MAPK signaling, slightly activate p38 MAPK and JAK2/STAT3 signaling, while had no significant effect on the activation of JNK MAPK, PI3K/AKT/mTOR and NF-κB signaling. By using specific inhibitors of these signaling pathways, we demonstrated that ERK1/2 signaling pathway, but not other signaling pathways, was involved in EGCG-mediated inhibition of HBV transcription and replication. Furthermore, we showed that EGCG treatment dose-dependently decreased the expression of hepatocyte nuclear factor 4α (HNF4α) both at the mRNA and protein levels, which could be reversed by pretreatment with the ERK1/2 inhibitor PD98059 (20 μM). Moreover, we revealed that EGCG treatment dose-dependently inhibited the activity of HBV core promoter and the following HBV replication. In summary, our results demonstrate that EGCG inhibits HBV gene expression and replication, which involves ERK1/2-mediated downregulation of HNF4α.These data reveal a novel mechanism for EGCG to inhibit HBV gene expression and replication.","Wang, Zi-yu; Li, Yu-qi; Guo, Zhi-wei; Zhou, Xing-hao; Lu, Mu-dan; Xue, Tong-chun; Gao, Bo",Acta Pharmacol Sin,213,1

In this study, we investigated the effects of a natural sesquiterpene lactone, 6-O-angeloylplenolin (6-OAP), isolated from the traditional Chinese medicine Centipeda minima (L.) A.Br., on neuroinflammation and the underlying mechanisms. We showed that treatment with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) caused activation of BV2 and primary microglial cells and development of neuroinflammation in vitro, evidenced by increased production of inflammatory cytokines TNF-α and IL-1β, the phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of NF-κB, and the transcriptional upregulation of COX-2 and iNOS, leading to increased production of proinflammatory factors NO and PGE(2). Moreover, LPS treatment induced oxidative stress through increasing the expression levels of NOX2 and NOX4. Pretreatment with 6-OAP (0.5−4 μM) dose-dependently attenuated LPS-induced NF-κB activation and oxidative stress, thus suppressed neuroinflammation in the cells. In a mouse model of LPS-induced neuroinflammation, 6-OAP (5−20 mg·kg(−1)·d(−1), ip, for 7 days before LPS injection) dose-dependently inhibited the production of inflammatory cytokines, the activation of the NF-κB signaling pathway, and the expression of inflammatory enzymes in brain tissues. 6-OAP pretreatment significantly ameliorated the activation of microglia and astrocytes in the brains. 6-OAP at a high dose caused a much stronger antineuroinflammatory effect than dexamethansone (DEX). Furthermore, we demonstrated that 6-OAP pretreatment could inhibit LPS-induced neurite and synaptic loss in vitro and in vivo. In conclusion, our results demonstrate that 6-OAP exerts antineuroinflammatory effects and can be considered a novel drug candidate for the treatment of neuroinflammatory diseases.","Zhou, Yi-le; Yan, Yong-ming; Li, Si-yi; He, Dan-hua; Xiong, Sha; Wei, Su-fen; Liu, Wei; Hu, Ling; Wang, Qi; Pan, Hua-feng; Cheng, Yong-xian; Liu, Yong-qiang",Acta Pharmacol Sin,213,19

Recently, asiatic acid (AA), a triterpenoid compound from Chinese medicine Centella asiatica, has been found to attenuate renal fibrosis. In the current study, we explored the mechanisms underlying antifibrotic effect of AA on UUO model. SD rats and ICR mice were subjected to unilateral ureteral occlusion (UUO) surgery. Prior the surgery, rats were administered AA (10 mg·kg(−1) per day, ig) for 7 days, whereas the mice received AA (15 mg·kg(−1) per day, ig) for 3 days. UUO group displayed significant degree of renal dysfunction, interstitial fibrosis, oxidative stress, and activation of the TGF-β/Smad and Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway in the kidney, these pathological changes were greatly ameliorated by pretreatment with AA. In addition, we found that co-treatment with GW9662, a selective PPAR-γ antagonist (1 mg·kg(−1) per day, ip) for 7 days, abolished the protective effects of AA. We further revealed that AA pretreatment did not significantly change the expression levels of PPAR-γ in the kidney, but markedly increase the plasma levels of 15d-PGJ2, an endogenous ligand of PPAR-γ. In UUO mice, pretreatment with 15d-PGJ2 (24 μg·kg(−1) per day, ip, for 7 days) produced similar protective effect as AA. Moreover, AA pretreatment upregulated the expression levels of active, nuclear-localized SREBP-1 (nSREBP-1), whereas fatostatin, a specific inhibitor of SREBP-1, decreased the expression of nSREBP-1, as well as the level of 15d-PGJ2. These results provide new insight into the antifibrotic mechanism of AA and endogenous metabolites might become a new clue for investigation of drug mechanism.","Zhang, Zhi-hao; He, Jun-qiu; Zhao, Ying-yong; Chen, Hua-chao; Tan, Ning-hua",Acta Pharmacol Sin,213,1

We aimed to use MIRA software to investigate the efficiency of specific NIVR therapy as a standalone intervention, versus standardized physiotherapy for upper extremity rehabilitation in patients post-stroke. Fifty-five inpatients were randomized to control groups (applying standard physiotherapy and dexterity exercises) and experimental groups (applying NIVR and dexterity exercises). The two groups were subdivided into subacute (<six months post-stroke) and chronic (>six months to four years post-stroke survival patients). The following standardized tests were applied at baseline and after two weeks post-therapy: Fugl–Meyer Assessment for Upper Extremity (FMUE), the Modified Rankin Scale (MRS), Functional Independence Measure (FIM), Active Range of Motion (AROM), Manual Muscle Testing (MMT), Modified Ashworth Scale (MAS), and Functional Reach Test (FRT). The Kruskal–Wallis test was used to determine if there were significant differences between the groups, followed with pairwise comparisons. The Wilcoxon Signed-Rank test was used to determine the significance of pre to post-therapy changes. The Wilcoxon Signed-Rank test showed significant differences in all four groups regarding MMT, FMUE, and FIM assessments pre- and post-therapy, while for AROM, only experimental groups registered significant differences. Independent Kruskal–Wallis results showed that the subacute experimental group outcomes were statistically significant regarding the assessments, especially in comparison with the control groups. The results suggest that NIVR rehabilitation is efficient to be administered to post-stroke patients, and the study design can be used for a further trial, in the perspective that NIVR therapy can be more efficient than standard physiotherapy within the first six months post-stroke.","Miclaus, Roxana; Roman, Nadinne; Caloian, Silviu; Mitoiu, Brindusa; Suciu, Oana; Onofrei, Roxana Ramona; Pavel, Ecaterina; Neculau, Andrea",Brain Sci,213,17

Sigmar1 expression is significantly decreased in the hearts of human methamphetamine users and those of “binge and crash” methamphetamine-treated mice. The hearts of methamphetamine users also show signs of cardiomyopathy, including cellular injury, fibrosis, and enlargement of the heart. In addition, mice expose to “binge and crash” methamphetamine develop cardiac hypertrophy, fibrotic remodeling, and mitochondrial dysfunction leading to contractile dysfunction. Methamphetamine treatment inhibits Sigmar1, resulting in inactivation of the cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB), decreased expression of mitochondrial fission 1 protein (FIS1), and ultimately alteration of mitochondrial dynamics and function.

It spreads quickly in an overcrowded area like the annual Hajj pilgrimage in Saudi Arabia. Vaccination is the primary strategy for protection against influenza. Due to the occurrence of antigenic shift and drift of the influenza virus, a mismatch between vaccine strains and circulating strains of influenza may occur. The objective of this study is to assess the impact of mismatch between vaccine strains and circulating strains during Hajj, which brings together individuals from all over the globe. To this end, we develop deterministic mathematical models of influenza with different populations and strains from the northern and southern hemispheres. Our results show that the existence and duration of an influenza outbreak during Hajj depend on vaccine efficacy. In this concern, we discuss four scenarios: vaccine strains for both groups match/mismatch circulating strains, and vaccine strains match their target strains and mismatch the other strains. Further, there is a scenario where a novel pandemic strain arises. Our results show that as long as the influenza vaccines match their target strains, there will be no outbreak of strain H1N1 and only a small outbreak of strain H3N2. Mismatching for non-target strains causes about 10,000 new H3N2 cases, and mismatching for both strains causes about 2,000 more new H1N1 cases and 6,000 additional H3N2 cases during Hajj. Complete mismatch in a pandemic scenario may infect over 342,000 additional pilgrims (13.75%) and cause more cases in their home countries.","Alharbi, Mohammed H.; Kribs, Christopher M.",Bull Math Biol,213,8

We compared the use of carbapenems between paediatric and adult subjects admitted to a French tertiary hospital and described the intervention of an antibiotic stewardship team (AST). As part of AST routine activity, all adult and paediatric patients receiving carbapenems are identified in real time using a computer-generated alert system and reviewed by the AST. Data associated with carbapenem prescriptions were extracted for 2 years (2014–2015) and were compared between paediatric and adult wards. Prescription appropriateness (i.e. no clinically suitable narrower spectrum alternative to carbapenem for de-escalation) and AST intervention were analysed. In total, 775 carbapenem prescriptions for 291 children and 262 adults were included. Most patients (95%) had a comordity and 52% had known recent carriage of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase producing Enterobacteriaceae (ESBLE). Most carbapenem prescriptions came from intensive care units (n = 269, 35%) and were initiated for urinary tract (n = 200, 27%), sepsis (n = 181, 25%), and lung (n = 153, 21%) infections. Carbapenems were initiated empirically in 537 (70%) cases, and an organism was isolated in 523 (67%) cases. Among the isolated organisms, 47% (n = 246) were ESBLE and 90% (n = 468) were susceptible to carbapenems, but an alternative existed in 61% (n = 320) of cases according to antibiotic susceptibility testing. Among prescriptions reviewed by the AST, 39% (n = 255) were considered non-appropriate and led to either antibiotic discontinuation (n = 47, 7%) or de-escalation (n = 208, 32%). Non-appropriate prescriptions were more frequent in paediatric wards (p = 0.01) and in microbiologically documented infections (p = 0.013), and less observed in immunocompromised patients (p = 0.009) or with a known ESBLE carriage (p < 0.001).

METHODS: One hundred and seventy five eyes with CSC were evaluated in this retrospective observational study. The eyes with acute or chronic CSC with no NV were included in Group 1, and those with NV were evaluated in Group 2. Only eyes that had undergone structural optical coherence tomography and optical coherence tomography angiography were included. Age, best-corrected visual acuity, and subfoveal choroidal thickness were evaluated in all eyes. In Group 2, the type and morphology of NV and the occurrence of exudation were considered. RESULTS: Of a total of 175 eyes with CSC, 86 had the acute form and 89 the chronic. Approximately 140 belonged to Group 1 (80%) and 35 to Group 2 (20%). Approximately 39.2% of all patient with chronic CSC developed NV. Mean age in Groups 1 and 2 was 53.3 years (±10.9) and 66.6 years (±10.2), respectively.

We aim to test the phylogenetic signal hypothesis in native and introduced species in Europe by examining climatic niche similarity. We examined data from 134 ant species commonly found in western Europe; 130 were native species, and 4 were introduced species. We characterized their distribution patterns using species records from different databases, determined their phylogenetic relatedness, and tested for a phylogenetic signal in their optimal climatic niches. We then compared the introduced species’ climatic niches in Europe with their climatic niches in their native ranges and with the climatic niches of their closest relative species in Europe. We found a strong phylogenetic signal in the optimal climatic niches of the most common ant species in Europe; however, this signal was weak for the main climatic variables that affect the distributions of introduced versus native species. Also, introduced species occupied different climatic niches in Europe than in their native ranges; furthermore, their European climatic niches did not resemble those of their closest relative species in Europe. We further discovered that there was not much concordance between the climatic niches of introduced species in their native ranges and climatic conditions in Europe. Our findings suggest that phylogenetics do indeed constrain shifts in the climatic niches of native European ant species. However, introduced species would not face such constraints and seemed to occupy relatively empty climatic niches.","Arnan, Xavier; Angulo, Elena; Boulay, Raphaël; Molowny-Horas, Roberto; Cerdá, Xim; Retana, Javier",Sci Rep,213,20

Our previous study showed that the cryptic MRD biosynthetic gene cluster (BGC) mrd in Streptomyces roseosporus NRRL 15998 could not be activated by its endogenous regulator 02995 but activated by an exogenous activator SsaA from sansanmycin’s BGC ssa of Streptomyces sp. strain SS. Here we report the molecular mechanism for this inexplicable regulation. EMSAs and footprinting experiments revealed that SsaA could directly bind to a 14-nt palindrome sequence of 5′-CTGRCNNNNGTCAG-3′ within six promoter regions of mrd. Disruption of three representative target genes (SSGG-02981, SSGG-02987 and SSGG-02994) showed that the target genes directly controlled by SsaA were essential for MRD production. The regulatory function was further investigated by replacing six regions of SSGG-02995 with those of ssaA. Surprisingly, only the replacement of 343–450 nt fragment encoding the 115–150 amino acids (AA) of SsaA could activate MRD biosynthesis. Further bioinformatics analysis showed that the 115–150 AA situated between two conserved domains of SsaA.

Long-term use (ie, ≥5 years) and high-dose HCQ (ie, >5 mg/kg/day) are both risk factors for developing HCQ retinopathy. Advances in our understanding of HCQ retinopathy have led to changes in the recommendations for HCQ dosing and retinopathy screening. The latest EULAR guidelines for the management of SLE recommend a maximum HCQ dose of 5 mg/kg/day and ophthalmological screening at baseline and annually after 5 years of HCQ treatment. OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to assess whether the EULAR guidelines are affecting HCQ prescription patterns and screening frequencies in Europe. Furthermore, we inventoried adherence to HCQ. RESULTS: The online questionnaire was completed by 2936 patients with systemic, cutaneous or juvenile lupus from 33 countries. The majority were female (86.5%) and diagnosed with SLE (81.2%). Among those taking HCQ, the median HCQ dose reported was 4.26 mg/kg/day. More than one-third of respondents (36.8%) exceeded the recommended maximal HCQ dose of 5 mg/kg/day. Baseline ophthalmological screening had been done in 857 out of 1017 respondents diagnosed in the past 10 years (84.3%). Of patients using HCQ ≥5 years, 69.2% reported yearly retinopathy screening. Lastly, 17.3% of patients reported that they skipped HCQ once a week or more often. CONCLUSION: The results of our study demonstrate that higher than recommended dosages of HCQ are prescribed to more than one-third of patients with lupus in Europe.

The aim of the current systematic review was to identify protective and risk factors of mental health help-seeking patterns among the disaggregated Asian Americans and to classify types of help. METHODS: A systematic literature review was conducted using the PRISMA guidelines. The Health Belief Model served as the theoretical framework for this review. Thirty-four articles were reviewed, and the studies investigated one of the following Asian ethnic subgroups: Chinese, Filipino, Asian Indian, Korean, or Vietnamese. Data were extracted based on the study characteristics, sample characteristics, and protective and risk factors to mental health help-seeking patterns. RESULTS: Predisposing factors like female gender, higher levels of English proficiency, and history of mental illness increased the likelihood for help-seeking across several ethnic groups. Interestingly, cues to action and structural factors were under-examined. However, cues to action like having a positive social network did increase the likelihood of using formal support services among Chinese and Filipinx participants. Structural factors like lacking ethnic concordant providers and access to healthcare served as barriers for Korean and Vietnamese participants. DISCUSSION: The findings showed a need for ethnic tailored approaches when supporting mental health help-seeking patterns. Asian ethnic group’s immigration status, acculturation level, and psychological barriers to help-seeking should continue to be emphasized.

However, the integration of eHealth into regular health care is challenging. It requires organizations to change the way they work and their structure and care processes to be adapted to ensure that eHealth supports the attainment of the desired outcomes. OBJECTIVE: The aims of this study are to investigate whether there are identifiable indicators in the structure, process, and outcome categories that are related to the successful integration of eHealth in regular health care, as well as to investigate which indicators of structure and process are related to outcome indicators. METHODS: A systematic literature review was conducted using the Donabedian Structure-Process-Outcome (SPO) framework to identify indicators that are related to the integration of eHealth into health care organizations. Data extraction sheets were designed to provide an overview of the study characteristics, eHealth characteristics, and indicators. The extracted indicators were organized into themes and subthemes of the structure, process, and outcome categories. RESULTS: Eleven studies were included, covering a variety of study designs, diseases, and eHealth tools. All studies identified structure, process, and outcome indicators that were potentially related to the integration of eHealth. The number of indicators found in the structure, process, and outcome categories was 175, 84, and 88, respectively. The themes with the most-noted indicators and their mutual interaction were inner setting (51 indicators, 16 interactions), care receiver (40 indicators, 11 interactions), and technology (38 indicators, 12 interactions)—all within the structure category; health care actions (38 indicators, 15 interactions) within the process category; and efficiency (30 indicators, 15 interactions) within the outcome category. In-depth examination identified four most-reported indicators, namely “deployment of human resources” (n=11), in the inner setting theme within the structure category; “ease of use” (n=16) and “technical issue” (n=10), both in the technology theme within the structure category; and “health logistics” (n=26), in the efficiency theme within the outcome category. CONCLUSIONS: Three principles are important for the successful integration of eHealth into health care.

When such receptor–ligand bonds last long enough, the leukocyte microvilli become extended and eventually form thin, 20 µm long tethers. Tether formation can be observed in blood vessels in vivo and in microfluidic flow chambers. Tethers can also be extracted using micropipette aspiration, biomembrane force probe, optical trap, or atomic force microscopy approaches. Here, we review the biomechanical properties of leukocyte tethers as gleaned from such measurements and discuss the advantages and disadvantages of each approach. We also review and discuss viscoelastic models that describe the dependence of tether formation on time, force, rate of loading, and cell activation. We close by emphasizing the need to combine experimental observations with quantitative models and computer simulations to understand how tether formation is affected by membrane tension, membrane reservoir, and interactions of the membrane with the cytoskeleton.","Cugno, Andrea; Marki, Alex; Ley, Klaus",Life (Basel),213,1

METHODS: In this case series, a total of 26 patients (8 males, 18 females; median age: 58 years; range, 34 to 67 years) who were evaluated by a multidisciplinary team and were diagnosed with chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension who underwent pulmonary endarterectomy in our clinic between November 2015 and December 2019 were included. Pulmonary endarterectomy procedure was performed in all cases under cardiopulmonary bypass and total circulatory arrest. The results of the procedures were analyzed retrospectively. RESULTS: Perioperative complications were observed in seven patients (26.9%) and in-hospital mortality rate caused by perioperative complications was 15.38%. At one-year of postoperative follow-up, the mean systolic pulmonary artery pressure decreased from 78±22 mmHg to 41±20 mmHg, pulmonary vascular resistance decreased from 698±10 dyn·s·cm-5 to 235±10 dyn·s·cm-5, 6-min walk distance increased from 345±10 m to 460±10 m and, arterial oxygen saturation increased from 85±3.5% to 95±4%. New York Heart Association functional class improvement from Class III-IV to Class I-II was observed in most patients, and one-year mortality rate was 19.23%. CONCLUSION: We suggest that patients diagnosed chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension should be referred to cardiac surgery centers for pulmonary thromboendarterectomy, early before irreversible arteriopathy occurs.","Orhan, Gökçen; Kuplay, Hüseyin; Selçuk, Nehir; Sert, Sena; Yıldırımtürk, Özlem",Turk Gogus Kalp Damar Cerrahisi Derg,213,22

The interplay between female fertility and autoimmune diseases (AIDs) can involve HLA haplotypes and micronutrients. We analyzed the distribution of HLA-DQ2/-DQ8 in women with infertility or recurrent spontaneous abortion (RSA) and possible associations with AIDs and micronutrient status. Methods. Consecutive women (n = 187) with infertility and RSA, and controls (n = 350) were included. All women were genotyped for HLA-DQ2 (DQA1*0201, A1*05, and B1*02) and -DQ8 (DQA1*03 and DQB1*0302) alleles. Serum 25(OH)D, VB12, folate, and ferritin were evaluated. Results. DQA1*05/B1*02 and the occurrence of at least one DQ2 allele were more prevalent among RSA and infertile women than controls. Infertile women showed lower 25(OH)D and higher prevalence of AIDs than RSA women. In the multivariate analysis, DQA1*05/B1*02 was associated with a significantly higher risk of AIDs in infertile women, and DQA1*05 was independently associated with both 25(OH)D deficiency and AIDs. In RSA women, the presence of AIDs was associated with a significantly higher risk of 25(OH)D deficiency. Conclusion. Our findings showed, for the first time, a higher proportion of DQ2 alleles in infertile and RSA women as compared to controls. Predisposing DQ2 alleles are independent risk factors for AIDs and 25(OH)D deficiency in infertile women and could represent biomarkers for performing early detection of women requiring individually tailored management.","Triggianese, Paola; Perricone, Carlo; De Martino, Erica; D’Antonio, Arianna; Chimenti, Maria Sole; Conigliaro, Paola; Ferrigno, Sara; Giambini, Ilio; Greco, Elisabetta; De Carolis, Caterina",Nutrients,213,1

Stimulating self-concept development could help adolescents to increase their chances of finding a suitable major. We addressed this issue by examining the effects of a naturalistic self-concept training within a gap year context on behavioral and neural correlates of self-evaluations, as well as the long-term effects for future educational decision-making. In total, 38 adolescents/young adults (ages 16-24 years) participated in a 4-wave longitudinal study, with lab visits before, during, and after the training, including behavioral assessments and fMRI. During fMRI-scanning, they rated themselves on positive and negative traits in academic, (pro)social, and physical domains, and additionally filled out questionnaires related to self-esteem and self-concept clarity. Results showed that the positivity of domain-specific self-evaluations, self-esteem, and self-concept clarity increased during the training. Second, participants with lower medial PFC activity during self-evaluation before training showed larger self-esteem increases over the year. Moreover, mPFC activity increased after training for the evaluation of positive but not negative traits. Furthermore, individual differences in the rate of change (slope) in self-concept clarity and social self-evaluations positively predicted social adjustment to college and academic performance 6 months after training. Together, these findings suggest that self-concept can be modulated in late adolescents, with an important role of the medial PFC in relation to enhanced positive self-evaluations, and self-concept clarity as a predictor of future educational outcomes.

Current influenza modeling efforts considering responsive behavior either oversimplify the process and may underestimate pandemic impacts, or make other problematic assumptions and are therefore constrained in utility. This study develops an agent-based model for pandemic simulation, and incorporates individual responsive behavior in the model based on public risk communication literature. The resultant model captures the stochastic nature of epidemic spread process, and constructs a realistic picture of individual reaction process and responsive behavior to pandemic situations. The model is then applied to simulate the spread dynamics of 2009 H1N1 influenza in a medium-size community in Arizona. Simulation results illustrate and compare the spread timeline and scale of this pandemic influenza, without and with the presence of pubic risk communication and individual responsive behavior. Sensitivity analysis sheds some lights on the influence of different communication strategies on pandemic impacts. Those findings contribute to effective pandemic planning and containment, particularly at the beginning of an outbreak.","Zhong, Wei",Comput Math Organ Theory,213,1

The history of science challenges its rationality in a different way in the pessimistic induction, where failures of our predecessors to come up with true theories about unobservable entities is taken by many to threaten the rationality of confidence in our own theories. The first problem arises from a perception of too much discontinuity, the second from an unfortunate kind of continuity, in the track record of science. I argue that both problems are only apparent, and due to under-description of the history.

At the farm level, data were stratified by season, with two six-month seasons (winter and summer) per year. The odds of farms with particular management strategies having above median morbidity were calculated. At the individual calf level, the odds of a calf being treated, controlling for farm of origin and month of birth, were calculated for different management practices. Farm size, and policies related to anti-scour vaccination, offering free-choice water and minerals to calves, methods of feeding, and the use of medicated feeds significantly altered the odds of a farm experiencing above-median pneumonia rates. Farm policies with regard to anti-scour vaccination, offering free-choice salt to calves, age at teat removal, type of calf housing, and use of preventive antimicrobials significantly altered the odds of a farm experiencing above-median scours rates. Scours and pneumonia were significantly associated with each other at both the farm and the calf level. No significant associations were found between individual calf management practices and the odds of being treated for scours. Sire used, method of first colostrum feeding, navel treatment, use of anti-scour vaccine in the dam, and the administration of preventive antimicrobials significantly altered the odds of a calf being treated for pneumonia.","Waltner-Toews, D.; Martin, S.W.; Meek, A.H.",Prev Vet Med,213,33

The lung represents a crucial interface between the host and the environment, and is therefore constantly prone to various insults. The development of critical care medicine was largely linked to the management of acute respiratory failure. Beyond etiological treatments and ventilatory support, the potentially harmful effects of unleashed pulmonary inflammation in critically ill patients led researchers to assess the benefits of adjuvant immunomodulatory therapies. The development of such innovative treatments not only depends on a better understanding of the pathophysiology of acute lung injury, but also required the validation of dynamic assessment tools to be used at the bedside.","Guillon, A.; Gibot, S.; Ait-Oufella, H.; Uhel, F.; Monneret, G.; Sharshar, T.; Taccone, F.

The complexity of mutant spectra can influence disease progression and viral pathogenesis, as demonstrated using virus variants selected for increased replicative fidelity. Complementation and interference exerted among components of a viral quasispecies can either reinforce or limit the replicative capacity and disease potential of the ensemble. In particular, a progressive enrichment of a replicating mutant spectrum with interfering mutant genomes prompted by enhanced mutagenesis may be a key event in the sharp transition of virus populations into error catastrophe that leads to virus extinction. Fitness variations are influenced by the passage regimes to which viral populations are subjected, notably average fitness decreases upon repeated bottleneck events and fitness gains upon competitive optimization of large viral populations. Evolving viral quasispecies respond to selective constraints by replication of subpopulations of variant genomes that display higher fitness than the parental population in the presence of the selective constraint. This has been profusely documented with fitness effects of mutations associated with resistance of pathogenic viruses to antiviral agents. In particular, selection of HIV-1 mutants resistant to one or multiple antiretroviral inhibitors, and the compensatory effect of mutations in the same genome, offers a compendium of the molecular intricacies that a virus can exploit for its survival. This chapter reviews the basic principles of quasispecies dynamics as they can serve to explain the behavior of viruses.","Domingo, Esteban; Escarmís, Cristina; Menéndez-Arias, Luis; Perales, Celia; Herrera, Mónica; Novella, Isabel S.; Holland, John J.",Origin and Evolution of Viruses,213,1

The targeted epitopes are generated by a post‐translational modification catalysed by the calcium‐dependent enzyme peptidyl arginine deaminase that converts the positively charged arginine to polar but uncharged citrullin. The aim of this study was to analyse the presence of citrulline in the joints at different time points of collagen‐induced arthritis in DA rats by immunohistochemistry and to investigate how immunogenicity and arthritogenicity was affected by citrullination of rat serum albumin (RSA) and collagen type II (CII). Our results indicate that citrulline could be detected in joints of arthritic animals, first appearance at the onset of disease and increasing as disease progressed into a chronic state. Unimmunized animals or time points before clinical signs of arthritis were negative. By morphology, we state that some infiltrating macrophages as well as the cartilage surface stain positive for citrulline, while the major source of citrullinated proteins appears to be fibrin depositions. A specific Cit‐RSA T‐cell response was observed in animals challenged by citrullinated RSA, no response was recorded when RSA was used as a stimulus. The IgG analysis reveals not only a response towards the modified protein but also cross‐reactivity to native RSA. No T‐cell or B‐cell response was noted in animals injected with unmodified RSA. Cit‐CII induced a disease with higher incidence and earlier onset than did the native counterpart. We conclude that, in contrast to the human disease, citrulline does not seem to appear before clinical signs. As inflammation proceeds, citrulline is detected specifically in the joints. All other organs investigated were negative. We also conclude that citrullination of a protein can break tolerance and increase its arthritogenic properties.","Lundberg, K.; Nijenhuis, S.; Vossenaar, E.; Venrooij, W.

In patients with colorectal cancer, postoperative infection is associated with poor prognosis. The aim of the present study was to evaluate (1) the relation between the MBL pathway and postoperative infectious complications and survival of patients resected for colorectal cancer and (2) the role of MBL as acute phase reactant compared to CRP. Methods: Preoperative MBL concentration, MBL/MBL‐associated serine protease (MASP) activity and CRP were determined in serum from 611 patients and 150 healthy controls. The patients were observed for 8 years. Postoperative infections, recurrence and survival were recorded. Results: The MBL pathway components were increased in the patients (P < 0.0001) compared to healthy controls. Low MBL levels were predictive of pneumonia (P = 0.01), and pneumonia (n = 87) was associated with poor survival (P = 0.003, HR = 1.5, 95% CI 1.1–1.9). MBL and MBL/MASP activity could not predict postoperative overall infections. MBL showed no correlation (spearman's ρ = 0.02, 95% CI −0.06–0.10) with CRP. Conclusions: Low preoperative MBL levels are predictive of pneumonia, which is associated with poorer survival. MBL concentration and MBL/MASP activity was not predictive of other postoperative infections or long‐term prognosis. MBL apparently is not a surrogate measure of CRP.","Ytting, H.; Christensen, I.

The database represents a computer‐based replacement for the laboratory notebooks used in the majority of research laboratories worldwide. In addition, the database provides an effective tool for organizing and managing laboratory information at all levels, spanning from managing and revising standard operating procedures and producing documentation of research activities to keeping track of data and conclusions. Using the commercially available database toolkit software filemaker pro, we have developed a relational database solution for management of laboratory information. The system consists of a hierarchy of five interrelated databases, each pertaining to a separate type of information, namely, overall project information, information relating to individual experiment setups, documentation of daily research activity, generated data and descriptions of standard operating procedures. Like other databases, each individual database consists of a number of records, each comprised of a set of fields in which information is entered. In each record, a certain field is reserved to specify the relation of the record to a record in another database at a higher level. Thus, the database is essentially five databases linked by a hierarchy of one‐to‐many relations, organizing information in a folder‐like structure. Importantly, the database system allows multiple users to access and edit records simultaneously, and the data entered in one database immediately becomes accessible through the other databases. The limitations of laboratory notebooks are apparent when looking for information, which is dispersed throughout one or more notebooks, or possibly on loose sheets of paper or printouts ‘somewhere’. The often complicated process of gathering laboratory data or results when writing grant applications or research papers is made considerably easier with the database system. Thus, the database solution presented should be broadly attractive to researchers, irrespective of their scientific discipline.","Petersen, M. S.; Fleischer, C.

Neurotropic microbes, particularly herpesviruses, might set off chronic neuroinflammation. Amyloid-β (Aβ) has antimicrobial properties and could represent a brain defense against infection. OBJECTIVE: We searched for protein sequence alignment between herpes simplex virus type I (HSV-1) HSV-2, and Aβ. METHODS: Protein data bank (pdb) structures for Aβ, HSV-1, and HSV-2 were searched on the RCSB Protein Data Bank. The protein structures were superimposed and aligned on PYMOL v 2.3.4. RESULTS: For HSV-1 and Aβ, amino acid residues ser549 – his569 of HSV-1 aligned closely with residues asp7 - asn27 of Aβ. For HSV-2 and Aβ, amino acid residues of HSV-2 aligned less closely than those of HSV-1 with residues of Aβ. CONCLUSION: Conjugating and binding to the same alpha helix in the HSV-1 protease, Aβ could be marking HSV-1 for attack by the immune system, providing a rapid inherited immune response to a destructive neurotropic virus that would otherwise require the more time-consuming involvement of T-cells, B-cells, and the adaptive immune system. But older people do not respond to viral infections as well as younger individuals. When HSV-1 infection advances in an old person, more and more amyloid is produced, forming an adhesive web. As the brain tries to hold the pathologic process in check, neuroinflammation increases and spreads. Progressive neurodegeneration and cognitive decline are the outcome.","Lehrer, Steven; Rheinstein, Peter H.",,213,1

We present the first formal calculus of spreadsheets with spilled arrays. Since spilled arrays may collide, the semantics of spilling is an iterative process to determine which arrays spill successfully and which do not. Our first theorem is that this process converges deterministically. To model gridlets, we propose the grid calculus, a higher-order extension of our calculus of spilled arrays with primitives to treat spreadsheets as values. We define a semantics of gridlets as formulas in the grid calculus. Our second theorem shows the correctness of a remarkably direct encoding of the Abadi and Cardelli object calculus into the grid calculus. This result is the first rigorous analogy between spreadsheets and objects; it substantiates the intuition that gridlets are an object-oriented counterpart to functional programming extensions to spreadsheets, such as sheet-defined functions.","Williams, Jack; Joharizadeh, Nima; Gordon, Andrew D.; Sarkar, Advait",Programming Languages and Systems,213,1

Our experience at the General Surgery Department in Queen Elizabeth Hospital, London",12.922512,8.8445,2021-05-04,"Background/Aims Leflunomide, a conventional disease modifying drug (csDMARD), is used in a variety of autoimmune rheumatic diseases (ARD) due to its immunomodulating, immunosuppressive and antiproliferative properties. This agent does however confer a greater infection risk and, due to its long half-life, drug washout procedures are often advised in the context of serious infections. Interestingly, Leflunomide is currently being tested as a potential therapy for COVID-19 in the general population. It is unknown whether leflunomide therapy is associated with a poor or favourable outcome among ARD patients infected with COVID-19. Methods A Scottish-wide registry was rapidly developed in March 2020. Clinical characteristics and outcomes of infected cases were collated across all Scottish health boards. Eligible patients included any adult leflunomide treated ARD patients with a confirmed (clinically or PCR) diagnosis of COVID-19. Results Of the 69 cases included in the registry, n = 4 were treated with leflunomide (75% female; mean age 61, SD 4.2). N = 2 were treated with combination baricitinib or hydroxychloroquine respectively, whilst n = 1 received recent corticosteroid therapy (intramuscular Kenalog). Comorbidities observed in this sub-cohort include diabetes mellitus n = 3, hypertension n = 2, cardiovascular disease n = 1, lung disease n = 1 and latent TB n = 1. At presentation, all patients (n = 4) experienced the established COVID-19 related symptom triad of dyspnoea, cough and fever and promptly developed acute respiratory syndrome. Diarrhoea was also recorded in n = 2 and constitutional upset n = 3. All patients suffered a serious COVID-19 disease outcome (defined as a requirement of invasive or non-invasive ventilation (n = 4) and/ or death (n = 2). Conclusion Preliminary data from this Scotland-wide registry has identified only a small number of leflunomide treated ARD patients infected with COVID-19. However, it is concerning that all cases experienced a serious outcome. Given the relatively infrequent prescription of this drug, combining similar national registry data is necessary to ensure this observation is not spurious. If confirmed, leflunomide washout procedures should be encouraged among such patients when they first present with COVID-19. Disclosure M. Karabayas: None. J. Brock: None. G. Fordyce: None. N.

Algal polysaccharides have aroused interest in the health sector owing to the various bioactivities namely anticancer, antiviral, immunoregulation, antidiabetic and antioxidant effects. The research community has comprehensively described the importance of algal polysaccharides regarding their extraction, purification, and potential use in various sectors. However, regardless of all the intriguing properties and potency in the health sector, these algal polysaccharides deserve detailed investigation. Hence, the present review emphasizes extensively on the previous and latest developments in the extraction, purification, structural properties and therapeutic bioactivities of algal polysaccharides to upgrade the knowledge for further advancement in this area of research. Moreover, the review also addresses the challenges, prospective research gaps and future perspective. We believe this review can provide a boost to upgrade the traditional methods of algal polysaccharide production for the development of efficacious drugs that will promote human welfare.

Several types of barbed sutures are available, each with unique advantages. OBJECTIVES The authors sought to determine whether the incidence of complications differed after wound approximation in plastic surgery when various brands of barbed vs nonbarbed traditional sutures were employed. METHODS The authors conducted a retrospective review of outcomes in body contouring, free flap, and breast reconstruction. Suture type and closure method were noted for each case. The number of complications after traditional 2-layer closure with nonbarbed sutures was compared with the number of complications after closure via 1- and 2-layer techniques with several brands of barbed sutures, and the brands of barbed sutures were compared with each other. RESULTS A total of 1011 unique surgical procedures, including 298 procedures with barbed sutures and 713 procedures with nonbarbed sutures, were performed by 5 members of the plastic surgery faculty. The 2-layer technique with barbed sutures was associated with significantly higher rates of wound separation than traditional methods. Excessive erythema along the incision site was significantly more frequent with Quill barbed sutures than with V-Loc barbed sutures. CONCLUSIONS Barbed sutures were associated with significantly higher rates of minor wound complications, specifically when the 2-layer closure technique was performed. Significantly higher rates of erythema were associated with Quill barbed sutures than with V-Loc barbed sutures.

Retrospective studies have revealed the safety and feasibility of SPLS for colon cancer treatment. However, no prospective randomized trials have been performed. The multicenter, randomized SIMPLE (single-port versus multiport laparoscopic surgery) trial aimed to investigate short-term perioperative outcomes of SPLS for colon cancer treatment, compared with multiport laparoscopic surgery (MPLS). METHODS Between August 2011 and April 2014, a total of 194 patients with colon cancer were recruited from seven hospitals in Korea. Patients were randomly allocated into the SPLS group (n = 99) or MPLS group (n = 95). The primary endpoint was postoperative complications. Operative, postoperative, and pathologic outcomes were analyzed after 50% of the patient study population had been recruited. RESULTS The patients' demographic characteristics, operative times, estimated blood volume losses, numbers of harvested lymph nodes, and lengths of both resection margins were not significantly different between groups. In the SPLS group, the rates of conversion to MPLS and open surgery were 12.9 and 2.2%, respectively. Postoperative complications occurred in 10.8% of the SPLS, and 12.5% of the MPLS patients (p = 0.714). Times to functional recovery, pain scores, and amounts of analgesia were similar between groups. CONCLUSION The results of this interim analysis suggested that SPLS is technically safe and appropriate when used for radical resection of colon cancer.

However, the lack of convincing evidence from most informative biomarkers of severe lung dysfunction (SLD-CF) has hampered the formulation of a conclusive, targeted diagnosis of CF. The aim of this study was to determine whether SLD-CF is related to the high concentration of sputum inflammatory mediators and the presence of biofilm-forming bacterial strains. Forty-one patients with advanced CF lung disease were studied. The severity of pulmonary dysfunction was defined by FEV1 <40%. CRP and NLR (Neutrophil-Lymphocyte Ratio) were examined as representative blood-based markers of inflammation. Expectorated sputum was collected and analysed for cytokines and neutrophil-derived defence proteins. Isolated sputum bacteria were identified and their biofilm forming capacity was determined. There was no association between FEV1% and total number of sputum bacteria. However, in the high-biofilm forming group the median FEV1 was <40%. Importantly, high density of sputum bacteria was associated with increased concentration of neutrophil elastase and IL-8 and low concentration of IL-6 and IL-10. The low concentration of sputum IL-6 is unique for CF and distinct from that observed in other chronic pulmonary inflammatory diseases. These findings strongly suggest that expectorated sputum is an informative source of pulmonary biomarkers representative for advanced CF and may replace more invasive BAL analysis to monitor the disease. We recommend to use of the following inflammatory biomarkers: blood CRP, NLR and sputum elastase, IL-6, IL-8 and IL-10.","Majka, Grzegorz; Mazurek, Henryk; Strus, Magdalena; Ciszek-Lenda, Marta; Szatanek, Rafał; Pac, Agnieszka; Golińska, Edyta; Marcinkiewicz, Janusz",Clinical and experimental immunology,213,23

Bevezetés: Egy új, számítógép által segített betegminta-asszociációs analízis eredménye szerint a COVID-19 tüneteinek kialakításában kiemelt tényezőként jelenik meg a bradikinin. Eszerint a bradikinin lebontása lelassul az angiotenzinkonvertáló enzim aktivitásának csökkenése miatt, ami jelentősen megemelkedő bradikininszinthez vezet a tüdőben. Nem merült fel azonban a véralvadási faktorok lehetséges szerepe a ""bradikininviharban"", annak ellenére, hogy az idősebb cardiovascularis betegekben aktiválódó XII-es faktor és a C1-észteráz-inhibitor (C1INH) alacsony szintje nagy mennyiségű bradikinin képződéséhez vezethet. Módszer: Átfogó irodalmi áttekintés. Eredmények: 1) A vírus által fertőzött, sérült endotheliumsejtek felülete az a hely, amellyel érintkezve elindulhat a XII-es véralvadási faktor aktivációja - ez serkenti a prekallikrein/kallikrein/kinin rendszert, és bradikininképződést okoz. Ez a folyamat megtörténik a súlyos vese- és tüdőkárosodást okozó hantavírus-fertőzésekben. 2) Idős betegekben az atherosclerosis miatt többszörösen sérült, merev, ""stiff"" erek endotheliumfelszínein jóval magasabb lehet a XII-es faktor kontakt úton történő aktivációja, mint a fiatal egyének ereiben. Ez a tény egyik oka lehet az idős, cardiovascularis betegek körében tapasztalt magasabb halálozásnak. Következtetés: Az aktivált XII-es véralvadási faktor célzott gátlása újabb gyógyítási lehetőség lehet a SARS-CoV-2-fertőzött idős betegekben. Jelenleg már hatásosnak bizonyult a bradikininképzést gátló C1INH-nak, továbbá a bradikininreceptor-gátlóknak az adása is. Orv Hetil. 2020; 161(50): 2099-2103. SUMMARY INTRODUCTION Bradykinin was implicated in a new complex model of pathomechanism leading to the symptoms of COVID-19 created by a computer-assisted association analysis. According to this model, the decrease in angiotensin-converting enzyme expression leads to impaired bradykinin elimination and subsequent enrichment in the lungs. However, there is no mentioning of the importance of blood coagulation factor XII in increased bradykinin production, in spite of its age-dependent activation and the lower level of C1-esterase inhibitor (C1INH). Activated factor XII may be an important contributor to the ""bradykinin storm"" in elder cardiovascular patients. METHOD Literature review. RESULTS 1) Activation of the coagulation factor XII on the surface of SARS-CoV-2 infected endothelial cells may trigger the prekallikrein/kallikrein/kinin system producing bradykinin. Such process is taking place in hantavirus infections causing severe lung and kidney damages. 2) The endothelial system is dysregulated in elderly patients, resulting in potentially higher factor XII activities on the surface of damaged endothelial cells in the stiffened arteries. This can contribute to the higher mortality rates in the elderly. CONCLUSION The targeted inhibition of activated blood coagulation factor XII may represent a new therapeutic target for COVID-19, especially for elder patients. Recently, beneficial results have already been observed by the clinical applications of recombinant C1INH and bradykinin receptor antagonists.

Definitive post-RFA treatment is yet to be determined. METHODS RFA was performed in 56 patients with BE, 38 with intestinal metaplasia (IM) and 18 with low-grade dysplasia (LGD), and repeated in case of residual BE. Length of the BE was classified according to C&M criteria. Follow-up included regular upper GI endoscopies with biopsies 6 months, 1 and 2 years after the complete resolution of BE. Patients were divided into two groups regarding post-RFA treatment: those maintaining proton pump inhibitors (PPI) daily and those submitted to laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication (LNF) at least 3 months after BE eradication or synchronous with RFA. RESULTS There were no perforations or strictures related to RFA. Complete endoscopic resolution of BE was observed in 83.92 % patients (86.84 % IM and 77.77 % LGD), in 25 that maintained PPI and 22 in whom LNF was done. In PPI group, 2-year follow-up revealed BE recurrence in biopsy samples in 20 % of patients, while in LNF group 9.1 % of patients had recurrent IM. In overall sample of patients, no difference was noted regarding the influence of post-RFA treatment (p < 0.423). LNF proved superiority over PPI treatment in patients with long-segment BE (cutoff C > 4 cm, p < 0.021). CONCLUSION HALO RFA is a safe procedure, with high rate of success in complete eradication of BE in symptomatic GERD patients. LNF provides good protection for neosquamous epithelium and in selected group of patients could be offered as a first line of treatment after HALO RFA.","Skrobić, Ognjan; Simić, Aleksandar; Radovanović, Nebojša; Ivanović, Nenad; Micev, Marjan; Peško, Predrag",Surgical endoscopy,213,5

During 2020 the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), emerged as a pandemic causing a global health crisis that significantly affected the world population in several areas, including medical practice, and pathology was no exception. OBJECTIVE. To summarize our experience in implementing digital pathology for remote primary diagnosis, education and research during this pandemic. DESIGN. We surveyed our pathologists (all subspecialized) and trainees to gather information about their use of digital pathology tools before and during the pandemic. Quality assurance and slide distribution data were also examined. RESULTS. During the pandemic, the widespread usage of digital tools in our institution allowed a smooth transition of most clinical and academic activities into remote with no major disruptions. The number of pathologists using whole slide imaging (WSI) for primary diagnosis increased from 20 (62.5%) to 29 (90.6%) out of a total 32 (100 %) pathologists, excluding renal pathology and hematopathology, during the pandemic. Furthermore, the number of pathologists exclusively using WSI for primary diagnosis also increased from 2 (6.3%) to 5 (15.6%) during the pandemic from the total of 32 (100%) pathologists. From 35 (100%) survey responses from attending pathologists, 21 (65.6%) reported using WSI for remote primary diagnosis following the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services waiver. Of these 21 pathologists, 18 (87%) responded that if allowed, they will continue using WSI for remote primary diagnosis after the pandemic. CONCLUSIONS. The pandemic served as a catalyst to pathologists adopting a digital workflow into their daily practice and realizing the logistic and technical advantages of such tools.","Lujan, Giovanni M; Savage, Johanna; Shana'ah, Arwa; Yearsley, Martha; Thomas, Diana; Allenby, Patricia; Otero, Jose; Limbach, Abberley Lott; Cui, Xiaoyan; Scarl, Rachel; Hardy, Tanner; Sheldon, Jesse; Plaza, Jose; Whitaker, Bonnie; Frankel, Wendy; Parwani, Anil; Li, Zaibo",Archives of pathology & laboratory medicine,213,2

We analyzed >4,700 SARS-CoV-2 genomes and associated meta-data retrieved from public repositories. SARS-CoV-2 sequences have a high sequence identity (>99.9%), which drops to >96% when compared to bat coronavirus genome. We built a mutation-annotated reference SARS-CoV-2 phylogeny with two main macro-haplogroups, A and B, both of Asian origin, and >160 sub-branches representing virus strains of variable geographical origins worldwide, revealing a rather uniform mutation occurrence along branches that could have implications for diagnostics and the design of future vaccines. Identification of the root of SARS-CoV-2 genomes is not without problems, owing to conflicting interpretations derived from either using the bat coronavirus genomes as an outgroup or relying on the sampling chronology of the SARS-CoV-2 genomes and TMRCA estimates; however, the overall scenario favors haplogroup A as the ancestral node. Phylogenetic analysis indicates a TMRCA for SARS-CoV-2 genomes dating to 12 November 2019 - thus matching epidemiological records. Sub-haplogroup A2 most likely originated in Europe from an Asian ancestor and gave rise to sub-clade A2a, which represents the major non-Asian outbreak, especially in Africa and Europe.

Aim In this prospective study, we aimed to investigate the hypothesis that risk of respiratory depression could be reduced and the desired level of sedation with minimal doses of propofol could be achieved by using BIS monitoring in endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) procedures. Material and methods Sixty patients in the ASA 1-2 category, who were scheduled for an ERCP with sedation, were randomly divided into two groups. The procedure was performed, and sedation was administered so that the patient's Ramsay Sedation Score (RSS) would be 4-5 in the first group (group 1) and the patient's BIS value would be 65-75 in the second group (group 2). Cardiopulmonary complications, the total duration of the procedure, and the total amount of propofol administered were recorded. Results The mean SpO2 measurements at the third minute, fifth minute, and 10th minute were higher in the BIS group (p < 0.001) (p < 0.05). The mean number of respirations during the third, fifth, 10th, and 15th minute of sedation was significantly higher in the RSS group than in the BIS group (p < 0.05). There was no difference between the groups in terms of recovery time, total propofol amount, and additional doses of bolus propofol. Conclusions BIS monitoring during sedation with propofol for ERCP did not reduce total propofol use, but it may be an efficient guide for the timing of additional dose administration, which could reduce the risk of respiratory depression, and it could be used safely as an objective method in the follow-up of level of sedation.","Inal, Ferda Yilmaz; Daskaya, Hayrettin; Yilmaz, Yadigar; Kocoglu, Hasan",Wideochirurgia i inne techniki maloinwazyjne = Videosurgery and other miniinvasive techniques,213,1

Approach and Results: VICs were isolated from human aortic valves obtained after surgery for calcific aortic valve disease and from normal aortic valves unsuitable for grafting (control VICs). We examined VIC in vitro and in vivo potential to differentiate in endothelial and perivascular lineages. VIC paracrine effect was also examined on human endothelial colony-forming cells. A pathological VIC (VICp) mesenchymal-like phenotype was confirmed by CD90+/CD73+/CD44+ expression and multipotent-like differentiation ability. When VICp were cocultured with endothelial colony-forming cells, they formed microvessels by differentiating into perivascular cells both in vivo and in vitro. VICp and control VIC conditioned media were compared using serial ELISA regarding quantification of endothelial and angiogenic factors. Higher expression of VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor)-A was observed at the protein level in VICp-conditioned media and confirmed at the mRNA level in VICp compared with control VIC. Conditioned media from VICp induced in vitro a significant increase in endothelial colony-forming cell proliferation, migration, and sprouting compared with conditioned media from control VIC. These effects were inhibited by blocking VEGF-A with blocking antibody or siRNA approach, confirming VICp involvement in angiogenesis by a VEGF-A dependent mechanism. CONCLUSIONS We provide here the first proof of an angiogenic potential of human VICs isolated from patients with calcific aortic valve disease. These results point to a novel function of VICp in valve vascularization during calcific aortic valve disease, with a perivascular differentiation ability and a VEGF-A paracrine effect. Targeting perivascular differentiation and VEGF-A to slow calcific aortic valve disease progression warrants further investigation.","Gendron, Nicolas; Rosa, Mickael; Blandinieres, Adeline; Sottejeau, Yoann; Rossi, Elisa; Van Belle, Eric; Idelcadi, Salim; Lecourt, Séverine; Vincentelli, André; Cras, Audrey; Jashari, Ramadan; Chocron, Richard; Baudouin, Yaël; Pamart, Thibault; Bièche, Ivan; Nevo, Nathalie; Cholley, Bernard; Rancic, Jeanne; Staels, Bart; Gaussem, Pascale; Dupont, Annabelle; Carpentier, Alain; Susen, Sophie; Smadja, David M","Arteriosclerosis, thrombosis, and vascular biology",213,1

Two novel measures of cognition (No Practice Effects (NPE) cognitive battery and Miami Computerized Functional Assessment Scale (CFAS)) were designed to have robust psychometric properties and reduced practice and ceiling effects. This study aims to evaluate if the NPE and CFAS demonstrate stronger psychometric properties and reduced practice effects compared with established measures, including the Preclinical Alzheimer Cognitive Composite (PACC), Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale (ADAS-Cog), and Functional Activities Questionnaire (FAQ). METHODS This parallel group, four-site study will randomize 320 cognitively intact adults aged 60 to 85 years to novel or well-established measures of cognition and function. All participants will receive assessments at baseline (week 0), week 12, and week 52, as well as a brain MRI scan and Apolipoprotein E genetic test at study entry. Analyses will determine psychometric properties of the NPE and CFAS, compare the sensitivity of measures to AD risk markers, and identify cognitive domains within the NPE. DISCUSSION Practice effects have been a major limitation of Alzheimer's disease clinical trials that typically assess cognitive changes over serial assessments. Detection of functional impairment in cognitively normal individuals with biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease requires instruments sensitive to very subtle functional changes. This study is intended to support the validation of two new composite measures, the NPE battery and the CFAS, which may advance clinical testing of interventions for individuals across the spectrum of early stage Alzheimer's disease.

BACKGROUND Smoking behavior in the context of bariatric surgery is poorly described. METHODS Adults undergoing RYGB surgery entered a prospective cohort study between 2006 and 2009 and were followed up to 7 years until ≤2015. Participants (N = 1770; 80% female, median age 45 years, median body mass index 47 kg/m) self-reported smoking history pre-surgery, and current smoking behavior annually. RESULTS Almost half of participants (45.2%) reported a pre-surgery history of smoking. Modeled prevalence of current smoking decreased in the year before surgery from 13.7% [95% confidence interval (CI) = 12.1-15.4] to 2.2% (95% CI = 1.5-2.9) at surgery, then increased to 9.6% (95% CI = 8.1-11.2) 1-year post-surgery and continued to increase to 14.0% (95% CI = 11.8-16.0) 7-years post-surgery. Among smokers, mean packs/day was 0.60 (95% CI = 0.44-0.77) at surgery, 0.70 (95% CI = 0.62-0.78) 1-year post-surgery and 0.77 (95% CI = 0.68-0.88) 7-years post-surgery. At 7-years, smoking was reported by 61.7% (95% CI = 51.9-70.8) of participants who smoked 1-year pre-surgery (n = 221), 12.3% (95% CI = 8.5-15.7) of participants who formerly smoked but quit >1 year pre-surgery (n = 507), and 3.8% (95% CI = 2.1-4.9) of participants who reported no smoking history (n = 887). Along with smoking history (ie, less time since smoked), younger age, household income <$25,000, being married or living as married, and illicit drug use were independently associated with increased risk of post-surgery smoking. CONCLUSION Although most adults who smoked 1-year before RYGB quit pre-surgery, smoking prevalence rebounded across 7-years, primarily due to relapse.","King, Wendy C; White, Gretchen E; Belle, Steven H; Yanovski, Susan Z; Pomp, Alfons; Pories, Walter J; Wolfe, Bruce M; Ahmed, Bestoun; Courcoulas, Anita P",Annals of surgery,213,1

It is common for suicide in young people to be preceded by a number of indications of risk, including self-harm, the communication of suicidal ideas, and recent contact with services. We examined whether there is a group of young people who die by suicide without explicit warning signs, and if they indicate risk indirectly, through other suicide risk factors. METHODS Using national mortality data, we identified a three-year UK national case series of deaths by suicide in people aged 10-19. We extracted information on the antecedents of suicide from coroner inquests and other official investigations into these deaths. RESULTS There were 595 suicides by young people between 2014 and 2016. We obtained data for 544 (91%). Around a third (n = 161, 30%) had no known history of suicidal ideas or self-harm. This group also had low rates of other risk factors for suicide, including substance misuse, a mental health diagnosis, recent adverse life events, and of contact with services. LIMITATIONS We relied on information provided to inquests and other investigations: under-reporting, especially on sensitive issues, is likely. Families and other witnesses may have under-reported warning signs that suggest they could have intervened. CONCLUSION Suicide after minimal warning appears to be relatively common in young people. Suicidal ideas may develop rapidly in this age group and crisis services should therefore be widely available. Future prevention cannot rely on explicit expressions of risk.","Rodway, Cathryn; Tham, Su-Gwan; Turnbull, Pauline; Kapur, Nav; Appleby, Louis",Journal of affective disorders,213,24

This study evaluated performance characteristics of the Panther Fusion assay for the detection of influenza A virus (Flu A), influenza B virus (Flu B), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), parainfluenza viruses 1 to 3 (Para 1 to 3), human metapneumovirus (hMPV), rhinovirus (RV), and adenovirus (Adeno) targets in comparison to those of the eSensor and Lyra assays using 395 nasopharyngeal (NP) and 104 lower respiratory tract (LRT) specimens. Based on the consensus positive result established (positive result in 2 of the 3 assays), the NP specimens for the Fusion and eSensor assays had 100% positive percent agreement (PPA) for all the analytes and the Lyra assays had 100% PPA for Flu A and Adeno analytes. A 100% negative percent agreement (NPA) was observed for all the Lyra analytes, whereas those for the Fusion targets ranged from 98.4 to 100% and those for the eSensor ranged from 99.4 to 100% for all the analytes except RV. For the LRT specimens, Fusion had 100% PPA and 100% NPA for all the targets except hMPV. There was a 100% PPA for eSensor analytes; the NPA ranged from 98 to 100%, except for RV. For the Lyra assays, the PPA ranged between 50 and 100%, while the NPA was 100% for all the targets except Adeno. The Fusion assay performed similarly to the eSensor assay for majority of the targets tested and provides laboratories with a fully automated random-access system to test for a broad array of viral respiratory pathogens.","Sam, Soya S; Caliendo, Angela M; Ingersoll, Jessica; Abdul-Ali, Deborah; Hill, Charles E; Kraft, Colleen S",Journal of clinical microbiology,213,1

OBJECTIVE To evaluate the benefit of routine radiographic screening for DNIAs. METHODS Data for 2153 patients with IAs were retrospectively analyzed. A total of 185 patients underwent screening for DNIAs at frequent intervals. RESULTS Overall, DNIAs were detected in 26 patients (1.2%). Of the 185 patients with surveillance, DNIAs developed in 9 (4.9%). The risk of DNIA detection was 1.14% per person-year of follow-up (95% confidence interval: 0.6%-2.2%). Patients with imaging follow-up had a significantly higher rate of DNIA detection compared with patients without regular imaging surveillance (4.9% vs 0.86%; P < .001), but surveillance was associated with smaller lesions (with surveillance: 3.8 ± 1.8 mm, without: 7.0 ± 4.4 mm, mean ± standard deviation; P = .026). A unimodal distribution of time to detection was found in those with surveillance, with a peak between 0 and 2 years. There was a trend toward an association of cigarette smoking and DNIA detection within 10 years (P = .06); 6 of the 26 patients (23.1%) with DNIAs had a history of cigarette smoking, with all 6 patients continuing to smoke up to the detection of the DNIAs, which were detected in 2.5 ± 1.8 years. CONCLUSION The low 1.14% per-person year risk of DNIA detection and small DNIA size at detection cannot justify routine screening for DNIAs in all patients with a personal history of IAs. If imaging follow-up is considered for selected patients, early screening will likely yield the most benefit in patients who continue to smoke cigarettes.","Wang, Joanna Y; Smith, Ryan; Ye, Xiaobu; Yang, Wuyang; Caplan, Justin M; Radvany, Martin G; Colby, Geoffrey P; Coon, Alexander L; Tamargo, Rafael J; Huang, Judy",Neurosurgery,213,24

However, how cells efficiently regulate their locomotion movements is still unclear. Since migration is also a crucial issue in cancer development, the goal of this narrative is to show the connection between basic findings in cell locomotion of unicellular eukaryotic organisms and the regulatory mechanisms of cell migration necessary for tumor invasion and metastases. More specifically, the review focuses on three main issues, (i) the regulation of the locomotion system in unicellular eukaryotic organisms and human cells, (ii) how the nucleus does not significantly affect the migratory trajectories of cells in two-dimension (2D) surfaces and (iii) the conditioned behavior detected in single cells as a primitive form of learning and adaptation to different contexts during cell migration. New findings in the control of cell motility both in unicellular organisms and mammalian cells open up a new framework in the understanding of the complex processes involved in systemic cellular locomotion and adaptation of a wide spectrum of diseases with high impact in the society such as cancer.","De la Fuente, Ildefonso M; López, José I",Cancers,213,1

It is unknown if this negative influence relies on the increased risk of AR or the DGF itself. The different Kidney Donor Profile Index (KDPI) values may also play a role in this interaction. METHODS Retrospective study aimed to evaluate the impact of DGF on graft function and graft survival in a subset of KT recipients (2004-2017). We also analyzed the relationship between KDPI and DGF. RESULTS The study includes601 KT,226of them (37%) developed DGF. Graft survival was lower in patients with DGF compared with non-DGF patients. Multivariable analysis revealed DGF as risk factor for graft loss, independently of the presence or not of acute rejection. Between DGF patients we observed poorer graft survival in patients with higher KDPI value (>85%).We observed a trend of a greater impact of KDPI in patients with DGF, although this interaction was not statistically significant. Additionally, we observed poorer 12-month graft function in DGF patients. CONCLUSION DGF is related to poorer graft survival independently of the developed of acute rejection. This negative impact might be influenced by high KDPI values.","Arias-Cabrales, Carlos E; Pérez-Sáez, María José; Redondo-Pachón, Dolores; Buxeda, Anna; Burballa, Carla; Duran, Xavier; Mir, Marisa; Crespo, Marta; Pascual, Julio",Transplant international : official journal of the European Society for Organ Transplantation,213,1

EXPERT OPINION Biosimilars, such as CT-P13, are an important resource for health care systems. Although CT-P13 approval in IBD was based on extrapolation, subsequent studies confirmed its clinical equivalence to originator infliximab. A new subcutaneous formulation of CT-P13 showed promising results in phase I and II trials in both CD and UC. Clinical efficacy and safety were comparable and interestingly serum drug doses appeared to be more stable than conventional intravenous CT-P13. If these preliminary results will be confirmed, the first sub-cutaneous version of infliximab could soon be available for IBD.","Parigi, Tommaso Lorenzo; D'Amico, Ferdinando; Peyrin-Biroulet, Laurent; Danese, Silvio",Expert opinion on biological therapy,213,20

Recent viral outbreaks have manifested the need of robust vaccine production platforms able to adapt to new challenges while achieving mass production capacity. For the rapid production of VLPs, the method of transient gene expression (TGE) have proved highly efficient. Based on a previous characterization of the HEK293 cell line upon transient transfection using multiplexed quantitative proteomics, molecular production bottlenecks and metabolic pathways likely to be optimized were identified. In this work, these molecular components and metabolic pathways have been explored and modulated via transient metabolic engineering using approaches like design of experiments (DoE) to fully exploit and optimize VLP production, transfection and budding efficiency. Upon overexpression of endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT) accessory proteins like NEDD4L and CIT, VLP production increased 3.3 and 2.9-fold respectively. Overexpression of glycosphingolipid precursor enzyme UGCG improved transfection efficiency by 17% and knocking-down the Gag-binding protein CNP improved 2.5-fold VLP specific productivity. Combining CNP inhibition and UGCG overexpression further improved budding efficiency by 37.3%.

In part 1, we introduce the training process framework and contextualize the role of TL monitoring in the injury-prevention paradigm. In part 2, we describe the conceptual and methodologic pitfalls of previous authors who associated TL and injury in ways that limited their suitability for the derivation of practical recommendations. The first important step in the training process is developing the training program: the practitioner develops a strategy based on available evidence, professional knowledge, and experience. For decades, exercise strategies have been based on the fundamental training principles of overload and progression. Training-load monitoring allows the practitioner to determine whether athletes have completed training as planned and how they have coped with the physical stress. Training load and its associated metrics cannot provide a quantitative indication of whether particular load progressions will increase or decrease the injury risk, given the nature of previous studies (descriptive and at best predictive) and their methodologic weaknesses. The overreliance on TL has moved the attention away from the multifactorial nature of injury and the roles of other important contextual factors. We argue that no evidence supports the quantitative use of TL data to manipulate future training with the purpose of preventing injury. Therefore, determining ""how much is too much"" and how to properly manipulate and progress TL are currently subjective decisions based on generic training principles and our experience of adjusting training according to an individual athlete's response. Our message to practitioners is to stop seeking overly simplistic solutions to complex problems and instead embrace the risks and uncertainty inherent in the training process and injury prevention.","Impellizzeri, Franco M; Menaspà, Paolo; Coutts, Aaron J; Kalkhoven, Judd; Menaspà, Miranda J",Journal of athletic training,213,1

OBJECTIVE The objective of the present study was to assess the negative impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on individuals who have previously sought treatment for a mental health disorder. METHODS The current study uses the newly developed Epidemic-Pandemic Impacts Inventory (EPII) survey. This tool was designed to assess tangible impacts of epidemics and pandemics across personal and social life domains. From November 9th, 2020 to February 18th, 2021, a total of 245 adults (recruited from a mental health clinic) completed the consent form and responded to the survey link from the Siyan Clinical Corporation and Siyan Clinical Research practices located in Santa Rosa, California, USA. RESULTS We found that the least affected age group was 75 years or older individuals. This was followed closely by the 65- to 75-year-old age group. People with children under the age of 18 also reported both more negative indicators associated with the pandemic and more positive indicators compared to those without children at home. Gender queer, non-conforming, and transgender individuals may also be at risk for more negative impacts associated with the pandemic. When respondents were assessed with regard to their mental health diagnosis no differences were notes. Substance use also increased during the pandemic. CONCLUSIONS In conclusion, the data collected here may serve as foundational research in the prevention, care and treatment of mental health disorders during pandemics such as COVID-19. Populations such as those with previously diagnosed mental health disorders are particularly at risk for negative effects of pandemic-related stressors such as social isolation, especially if they have children in the household, are of a younger age group, or have substance use disorder. Gender may also be a factor. Further, the EPII survey may prove to be a useful tool in understanding these effects. Overall, these data may be a critical step towards understanding the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on populations with a mental health diagnosis, which may aid mental health practitioners in understanding the consequences of pandemics on their patients' overall well-being.

Three quarters of TDIs are due to blunt thoraco-abdominal trauma. In blunt TDIs, variable clinical presentations and frequent concurrent life-threatening injuries may hinder early recognition and treatment, leading to diagnostic delays, which may result in technically more challenging repairs. Right-sided blunt TDIs are much less common than left-sided ones, are difficult to visualize on imaging studies, are more frequently associated with other potentially lethal injuries, and tend to present more subtly, so that diagnostic delays are more likely. CASE PRESENTATION We report the diagnosis and elective repair of a large right-sided traumatic diaphragmatic hernia resulting from a distant blunt abdominal injury, describing the techniques used to address the challenges presented by the chronic intrathoracic displacement of the entire liver with the gallbladder, as well as the right side of the colon and part of the duodenum. CONCLUSIONS Early diagnosis of right-sided TDIs can be especially elusive. The management of delayed diaphragmatic hernias can be challenging, but with meticulous planning and a flexible surgical approach, a repair can be achieved resulting in good recovery and low risk of recurrence.","Kesavaramanujam, Satish; Morell, Michael C; Harigovind, Dhanush; Bhimmanapalli, Chandana; Cassaro, Sebastiano",Surgical case reports,213,13

In the current study, we aimed to examine the efficiency of hand-sewn and LSJ thyroidectomy, based on operation time and perioperative complications. METHODS All patients with the diagnosis of multinodular goiter, thyroid cancers, retrosternal goiter and other indications for thyroid surgeries, enrolled. Of 550 patients, 261 patients randomly assigned to the conventional group (A) and 274 patients to LigaSure Small Jaw group (B). Study groups compared concerning operative time, recurrent laryngeal nerve (RLN) injury, hypocalcemia, and postoperative complications. RESULTS There was no significant difference regarding demographic data between groups A and B. During total thyroidectomy, intraoperative blood loss was 64.42 ± 20.72 ml and 49.64 ± 17.92 ml in groups A and B, respectively (P 0.043). Operative time was significantly lower in LSJ group compared to the conventional group in total and subtotal thyroidectomy (P 0.002; P 0.001). Three patients who underwent conventional total thyroidectomy had RLN palsy. However, there was no significant difference between techniques regarding RLN injury (P 0.134). Postoperative total and ionized serum calcium levels decreased compared to preoperative levels in both conventional and LSJ technique; however, changes in total and ionized serum calcium were more severe in patients with conventional thyroidectomy (total calcium, P < 0.0001) (ionized calcium, P 0.005). CONCLUSION The LigaSure Small Jaw device decreases operative time and intraoperative bleeding compared to conventional technique. Besides, changes in total and ionized calcium levels in patients with LSJ thyroidectomy are subtle compared to HS technique.

Estimates of those who are able to clear the virus with a- or pauci-symptomatic COVID-19 remain unclear, and dependent on widespread testing. However, evidence is emerging that in severe cases pathological mechanisms of hyper-inflammation and coagulopathy ensue, the former supported by results from the RECOVERY trial demonstrating a reduction in mortality with dexamethasone in advanced COVID-19. It remains unclear whether these pathogenic pathways are secondary to a failure to clear the virus because of maladaptive immune responses or if these are sequential COVID-19 defining illnesses. Understanding the pathophysiological mechanisms underpinning these cascades is essential to formulating rationale therapeutic approaches beyond the use of dexamethasone.

Data on respiratory viral infections in children with cancer are limited. METHODS A long-term, prospective, multicenter study was carried out in Finland searching for respiratory viruses in febrile children with leukemia. For this purpose, 138 febrile episodes in 51 children with leukemia were analyzed. Twelve types of respiratory viruses were searched for by viral culture, antigen detection, and polymerase chain reaction tests. RESULTS Evidence of a respiratory viral infection was found in 61 of 138 febrile episodes (44%), accounting for an incidence of 0.8 (range, 0-2.4) per person year at risk during the treatment of leukemia. The most common viruses detected were rhinovirus (22%), respiratory syncytial virus (11%), human bocavirus (5%), and influenza A virus (4%). Dual viral infections were detected in 12 cases (9%). Half of the children had respiratory symptoms with cough being the most common symptom. Two children developed pneumonia. The mean duration of fever was 2.6 (SD 1.7) days in children with respiratory viral infection and 2.1 (SD 1.3) days in children without evidence of viral infection (P = 0.44). CONCLUSIONS Respiratory viruses are found commonly during febrile episodes in children with leukemia. The detection of viruses permits the use of available antiviral agents, may explain a poor response to antimicrobial agents, and minimizes the proportion of febrile episodes without possible etiologic agents in children with leukemia.","Koskenvuo, Minna; Möttönen, Merja; Rahiala, Jaana; Saarinen-Pihkala, Ulla M; Riikonen, Pekka; Waris, Matti; Ziegler, Thedi; Uhari, Matti; Salmi, Toivo T; Ruuskanen, Olli",The Pediatric infectious disease journal,213,19

Therefore, 287 primary CRC patients and 287 age-matched healthy control subjects were recruited to estimate the seroprevalence of T. gondii and identify the risk factors of infection. Enzyme-linked immunoassays were used to test for anti-T. gondii immunoglobulin G (IgG) and IgM antibodies. Forty-six (16%) samples were positive for anti-T. gondii IgG antibodies in patients with CRC, compared with 26 (9.1%) in the healthy controls, a significant difference (P = 0.007). By contrast, eight (2.8%) patients tested positive for T. gondii IgM antibodies, compared with three (1.1%) in the controls, a difference that was not significant (P = 0.13). Multivariable backward stepwise logistic regression analysis revealed that a rural residence (OR 2.83; 95% CI 1.15-7.01; P = 0.024) and treatment with chemotherapy (OR 2.16; 95% CI 1.02-4.57; P = 0.045) were risk factors for T. gondii infection in patients with CRC. Thus, T. gondii infection is serious in patients with CRC, and a rural residence and treatment with chemotherapy are independent risk factors for infection by this parasite. Therefore, medical professionals should be aware of this pathogen in patients with CRC, and the causes of T. gondii infection in these patients need to be explored further.","Yu, Yang; Guo, Dong; Qu, Tingting; Zhao, Shuchao; Xu, Chang; Wang, Longlong; Wang, Zhongjun; Fu, Haiyang; Zhang, Xiangyan; Zhou, Na",BioMed research international,213,1

Laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) is an effective bariatric procedure that has become more common over the last two decades. We report on a morbidly obese patient with SIT who underwent a successful LSG. CASE REPORT A 54-year-old female morbidly obese patient (136k; 167cm; body mass index (BMI): 48kg/m2) was admitted for bariatric surgery. She had congenital SIT, a history of open cholecystectomy and, despite implementing the suggestions of the dietitian and endocrinologist, she had failed to lose weight. A standard LSG was performed successfully using the French method. The patient's postoperative course was uneventful and she was discharged on the 5th postoperative day. She is now in the 4th month with a weight loss of 30kg. DISCUSSION SIT is a rare congenital condition, occurring in 1/10,000 to 1/50,000 live births. Organ function is generally normal, although it may sometimes be accompanied by respiratory or cardiovascular anomalies. Although undertaking LSG on morbidly obese patients with SIT may seem a daunting proposition at first, experienced laparoscopic surgeons can manage this operation with success.

Thus, in this work, we propose a methodology to determine in advance potential disadvantages on the use of certain meshes based on the patient-specific abdominal geometry and the mechanical features of the certain meshes. To that purpose, we have first characterized the mechanical behavior of four synthetic meshes through biaxial tests. Secondly, two of these meshes were implanted in several New Zealand rabbits with a total defect previously created on the center of the abdominal wall. After the surgical procedure, specimen were subjected to in vivo pneumoperitoneum tests to determine the immediate post-surgical response of those meshes after implanted in a healthy specimen. Experimental performance was recorded by a stereo rig with the aim of obtaining quantitative information about the pressure-displacement relation of the abdominal wall. Finally, following the procedure presented in prior works (Simón-Allué et al., 2015, 2017), a finite element model was reconstructed from the experimental measurements and tests were computationally reproduced for the healthy and herniated cases. Simulations were compared and validated with the in vivo behavior and results were given along the abdominal wall in terms of displacements, stresses and strain. Mechanical characterization of the meshes revealed SurgiproTM as the most rigid implant and Neomesh SuperSoft® as the softer, while other two meshes (Neomesh Soft®, Neopore®) remained in between. These two meshes were employed in the experimental study and resulted in similar effect in the abdominal wall cavity and both were close to the healthy case. Simulations confirmed this result while showed potential objections in the case of the other two meshes, due to high values in stresses or elongation that may led to discomfort in real tissue. The use of this methodology on human surgery may provide the surgeons with reliable and useful information to avoid certain meshes on specific-patient treatment.","Simón-Allué, R; Ortillés, A; Calvo, B",Journal of the mechanical behavior of biomedical materials,213,28

In 2016, 6 PPC physician-experts in program development and quality improvement (QI) formed a healthcare learning collaborative network entitled the Pediatric Palliative Improvement Network (PPIN). MEASURES AND INTERVENTIONS The primary drivers identified were 1) Feasibility of a national learning network demonstrated through the completion of one small QI project, 2) Standard education in QI methodology and 3) Salient pediatric palliative care operational, clinical and satisfaction metrics clearly defined. OUTCOMES PPIN now includes146 members representing 51 organizations. In 2019 the group completed a national collaborative QI project focused on pain assessment at the time of initial consult, demonstrating a national increase in pain assessment from 75.8% to >90% over 12 months.

However, more recent research has highlighted the possibility that these findings are methodological artefacts, caused by confounding and other biases. While modern analytical and study design approaches can mitigate confounding and thus enhance causal inference in observational studies, they are not routinely applied in research assessing the relationship between alcohol use and long-term health outcomes. The purpose of this systematic review is to identify observational studies that employ these analytical/design-based approaches in assessing whether relationships between alcohol consumption and health outcomes are non-linear. This review seeks to evaluate, on a per-outcome basis, what these studies find the strength and form of the relationship between alcohol consumption and health to be. METHODS AND ANALYSIS Electronic databases (MEDLINE, PsycINFO, Embase and SCOPUS) were searched in May 2020. Study selection will comply with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. Articles will be screened against eligibility criteria intended to capture studies using observational data to assess the relationship between varying levels of alcohol exposure and any long-term health outcome (actual or surrogate), and that have employed at least one of the prespecified approaches to enhancing causal inference. Risk of bias of included articles will be assessed using study design-specific tools. A narrative synthesis of the results is planned.

As proposed, such screening could involve tens of millions of individuals, but detailed estimates of radiation doses and potential risk of radiation-induced cancer are not currently available. We estimated organ-specific radiation doses and associated cancer risks from coronary artery calcification screening with multidetector computed tomography according to patient age, frequency of screening, and scan protocol. METHODS Radiation doses delivered to adult patients were calculated from a range of available protocols using Monte Carlo radiation transport. Radiation risk models, derived using data from Japanese atomic bomb survivors and medically exposed cohorts, were used to estimate the excess lifetime risk of radiation-induced cancer. RESULTS The radiation dose from a single coronary artery calcification computed tomographic scan varied more than 10-fold (effective dose range, 0.8-10.5 mSv) depending on the protocol. In general, higher radiation doses were associated with higher x-ray tube current, higher tube potential, spiral scanning with low pitch, and retrospective gating. The wide dose variation also resulted in wide variation in estimated radiation-induced cancer risk. Assuming screening every 5 years from the age of 45 to 75 years for men and 55 to 75 years for women, the estimated excess lifetime cancer risk using the median dose of 2.3 mSv was 42 cases per 100 000 men (range, 14-200 cases) and 62 cases per 100 000 women (range, 21-300 cases). CONCLUSIONS These radiation risk estimates can be compared with potential benefits from screening, when such estimates are available.

METHODS This randomized controlled study aimed to determine the effect of interventions performed according to PLST on the care burden, care satisfaction, and life satisfaction of caregivers of middle and advanced stage Alzheimer's disease patients, and on the neuropsychiatric symptoms and agitation levels of these patients. The research was conducted with a total of 29 caregivers divided into intervention (15) and control (14) groups. Data were collected using an Introductory Information Form, plus the Standardised Mini-Mental State Examination, Neuropsychiatric Inventory, Cohen-Mansfield Agitation Inventory, Carer's Assessment of Satisfaction Index, and Life Satisfaction Scale. Three home visits were made to the caregivers by the researchers in the first, second, and twelfth weeks of the intervention. During the home visits, face-to-face training was given as necessary to the individual caring for problems identified in the nursing care plan according to PLST. RESULTS As a result of the PLST training, there was a decrease in the behavioural problems of Alzheimer's patients, along with a decrease in the care burden of the caregivers and an increase in their care satisfaction. When the scale total scores of the individuals in the intervention and control groups were compared, it was found that only caregivers' care satisfaction increased at a statistically significant level (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION At the end of the training given according to PLST, it was found that behavioural problems of Alzheimer's patients and the care burden of caregivers had decreased, and the care satisfaction of caregivers increased. It is recommended that Alzheimer's patients and their caregivers be given training and interventions according to PLST.","Duru Aşiret, Güler; Kütmeç Yılmaz, Cemile; Sayın Kasar, Kadriye",Psychogeriatrics : the official journal of the Japanese Psychogeriatric Society,213,16

In hospital spaces, early applications could soon enable more efficient clinical workflows and improved patient safety in intensive care units and operating rooms. In daily living spaces, ambient intelligence could prolong the independence of older individuals and improve the management of individuals with a chronic disease by understanding everyday behaviour. Similar to other technologies, transformation into clinical applications at scale must overcome challenges such as rigorous clinical validation, appropriate data privacy and model transparency. Thoughtful use of this technology would enable us to understand the complex interplay between the physical environment and health-critical human behaviours.","Haque, Albert; Milstein, Arnold; Fei-Fei, Li",Nature,213,19

A specific list of ICF categories, an ICF Core Set (CS), has been developed for bipolar disorder, depression and schizophrenia. The aim of this study was to determine commonalities in the ICF-CSs for these three disorders, and to identify relevant categories for the development of tentative ICF-CSs for severe mental disorders in general. METHODS The ICF categories of all three mental health conditions were examined and compared. RESULTS Comparison of the Comprehensive ICF-CSs for the three mental health conditions revealed a set of 34 common categories (i.e., 10 from the Body functions component, 14 from the Activities and participation component, and 10 Environmental factors ). These categories formed the proposed Comprehensive ICF-CS for severe mental disorders. A total of 11 categories were common to the Brief ICF-CSs of the three mental health conditions, and these formed the Brief ICF-CS for severe mental disorders (i.e., 3 from the Body functions component, 6 from the Activities and participation component, and 2 Environmental factors ). All the categories included refer to key aspects of functioning for severe mental disorders. CONCLUSIONS The proposed ICF-CSs for severe mental disorders may be applicable across a number of psychotic and affective disorders and they should prove useful for mental health services whose care remit covers a range of conditions.","Guilera, Georgina; Pino, Oscar; Barrios, Maite; Rojo, Emilio; Vieta, Eduard; Gómez-Benito, Juana",Psicothema,213,31

These changes can lead to complications if compounded by external stress and anxiety. COVID-19 has emerged as a chief stressor among the general population and is a serious threat among vulnerable populations. Therefore, there is a need for stress management tools, such as Yoga and physical exercises, both at home and at work. These can be adopted during the pandemic with proper maintenance of social distancing. OBJECTIVE To evaluate and compile literature that has reported the health outcomes of Yoga intervention on pregnancy at the workplace and analyzes both the restrictions as well as advantages of its beneficial effects in comparison to physical exercises. METHODOLOGY A comprehensive literature review was conducted utilizing PubMed and Google Scholar. The keywords used for the search include ""Yoga"", ""work"", ""complications"", ""physical exercise"", ""drugs"" and ""COVID"" indifferent permutations and combinations with ""pregnancy"". We compiled the literature with respect to pregnancy complications and the effects of drugs, physical activity and Yoga for preventing these complications. RESULTS We noted that pregnancy-related complications are becoming more prevalent because of a sedentary lifestyle, restricted physical activity and growing stress. In such situations, a home or workplace Yoga protocol can combine both exercise and mindfulness-based alleviation of anxiety for both working and non-working women. CONCLUSION Yoga can be effective for combating stress and anxiety besides boosting immunity in pregnant working women confronted with the COVID-19 pandemic.","Nadholta, Pooja; Bali, Parul; Singh, Amit; Anand, Akshay",Work,213,1

As such, there is considerable interest in better understanding the relationship between COVID-19 and anxiety and depressive disorders. Although individual differences in perceived stress have shown to be related to anxiety and depression in non-COVID-19 work, research has not examined potential factors underlying this relation in the context of COVID-19. Fatigue severity may be a promising mechanistic construct for perceived stress and anxiety and depression relations, as some work has found that perceived stress may predict elevated fatigue symptoms. As such, the current study sought to examine the potential explanatory role of fatigue severity in the relation between COVID-19 specific perceived stress and depression, anxiety, and panic symptoms among 563 adults (41.9% female, Mage = 38.26 years, SD = 12.15). Results suggested that COVID-19 perceived stress, via fatigue severity, significantly predicted depression, anxiety, and panic symptoms. These results provide initial empirical support for the role of fatigue severity in the relation between COVID-19 perceived stress and depression, anxiety, and panic symptoms. Future work would benefit from using longitudinal data to evaluate the current model.","Manning, Kara; Zvolensky, Michael J; Garey, Lorra; Long, Laura J; Gallagher, Matthew W",Cognitive behaviour therapy,213,1

While an expeditious and secure repair without complications is the objective, wound closure typically consumes a substantial percentage of the operative time and too often leads to delayed wound healing and other problems. OBJECTIVES The authors evaluate suture-line wound healing for body contouring operations with barbed suture wound closure compared with absorbable running suture closure. METHODS In this retrospective study, wound-healing complications for a 228 consecutive-patient cohort with barbed sutures over a period of 4 years were compared with those for a prior 132 consecutive-patient cohort with absorbable running sutures over a period of 2 years. Complications were classified according to severity: grade 1 (mild), grade 2 (moderate), and grade 3 (severe). The preferred suture techniques for the closure of either thick or thin subcutaneous tissue under tension are described. The authors' clinical impressions are also presented. RESULTS Patients whose wounds were closed with absorbable running sutures had a significantly greater incidence of complications at all severity grades of severity than did those with barbed suture closures, with the exception of grade 3 (severe) complications in thighplasty. Logistical regression was <1, and the confidence interval was also <1, in support of these results. CONCLUSIONS Proper barbed suture selection and 2-layer technique led to a statistically significant lower rate of wound-healing complications as compared with prior experience with traditional running braided absorbable sutures. Other benefits were more rapid speed of closure, adequate security of the wound closure, and increased surgeon satisfaction.

However, the provision of such care transforms a very private, personal activity into a social process. Understanding this complex process and the psychological impact it has on those providing and receiving care is critical in order to mitigate potential distress. The purpose of this study to examine the experience of delivering and receiving intimate personal care in the NH.Methods: A focused ethnographic approach with participant observation, semi-structured interviews, focus groups and drop-in sessions, document review, and field notes. Data were analysed using constant comparative analysis.Results: Quality care in this context is predicated on the care provider recognition of the emotional impact of care delivery on the care recipient. Our analysis identified that the overarching theme, of providing quality person-centred intimate care, requires creating and maintaining a relational space that promotes integrity.Conclusions: The provision of intimate personal care consists of a complex interplay at the level of resident/care provider interaction (micro level); health care organization (meso level); and policy (macro level). Each of these levels interacts with and influences the other two. The components identified in our model may provide the basis from which to further examine resident experiences of quality intimate personal care.","Thompson, Genevieve N; McClement, Susan E; Peters, Sheryl; Hack, Thomas F; Chochinov, Harvey; Funk, Laura",International journal of qualitative studies on health and well-being,213,20

Although NIRS holds potential for bedside monitoring of intestinal perfusion, there is insufficient evidence showing correlation with mesenteric blood flow. To determine if an association exists between abdominal regional oxygen saturation (A-rSO2) and mesenteric blood flow, we compared changes in A-rSO2 to changes in blood flow velocity in the superior mesenteric artery (SMA) before and after feedings in very-low birthweight infants. STUDY DESIGN A-rSO2 was continuously monitored midline below the umbilicus for 3 days in 18 stable 25 to 31 week bolus-fed infants (median BW 1203 g, median age 5 days). We compared change in SMA velocity from immediately before to 10 min and 60 to 120 min after feeding with change in A-rSO2 over the same time. Spearman's rank correlation was used to ascertain if a significant association existed. RESULT Change in A-rSO2 was significantly associated with change in systolic, diastolic, and mean SMA velocity from fasting to 60 to 120 min after feeding (P=0.016, 0.021, 0.010) and from 10 min after a feed to 60 to 120 min after feeding (P=0.009, 0.035, 0.032). CONCLUSION In very preterm infants, A-rSO2 reflects blood flow in the SMA and can provide non-invasive continuous monitoring of intestinal perfusion. Further studies are indicated to determine the sensitivity of NIRS to detect early intestinal pathology in this population.","Gillam-Krakauer, M; Cochran, C M; Slaughter, J C; Polavarapu, S; McElroy, S J; Hernanz-Schulman, M; Engelhardt, B",Journal of perinatology : official journal of the California Perinatal Association,213,1

Given the increasing demand to deliver services electronically due to public health concerns, it is important to review available TNP validity studies. This systematic review builds upon the work of Brearly and colleagues' (2017) meta-analysis and provides an updated review of the literature, with special emphasis on test-level validity data.Method: Using similar methodology as Brearly and colleagues (2017) three internet databases (PubMed, EBSCOhost, PsycINFO) were searched for relevant articles published since 2016. Studies with older adults (aged 65+) who underwent face-to-face and TNP assessments in a counterbalanced cross-over design were included. After review, 10 articles were retained. Combined with nine articles from Brearly's analysis, a total of 19 studies were included in the systematic review.Results: Retained studies included samples from 5 different countries, various ethnic/cultural backgrounds, and diverse diagnostic populations. Test-level analysis suggests there are cognitive screeners (MMSE, MoCA), language tests (BNT, Letter Fluency), attention/working memory tasks (Digit Span Total), and memory tests (HVLT-R) with strong support for TNP validity. Other measures are promising but lack sufficient support at this time. Few TNP studies have done in-home assessments and most studies rely on a PC or laptop.Conclusions: Overall, there appears to be good support for TNP assessments in older adults. Challenges to TNP in the current climate are discussed.

From March 2010 through August 2012, 84 LSG patients had BPS incorporated into their last two stapler firings (Group B). Staple lines were evaluated perioperatively for bleeding, and patients were monitored for indications of staple-line leaks (peritonitis, abnormal output from the drain). In preoperative Group A and B, there were 117 (73.1%) vs. 56 (66.7%) females; mean age, 35.2 years (18.0-68.0) vs. 33.8 years (15.0-64.0); mean body mass index (BMI, kilograms per square meter), 42.5 (27.0-76.0) vs. 42.0 (30.0-58.0).

The objective of this study was to analyze our institution's long-term surgical management outcomes for PPAS in the absence of a care pathway. From May 1997 to June 2013, 8 patients (mean age 60.6 ± 11.8 years; range, 40-73 years; 5 women and 3 men) underwent surgical intervention for PPAS at our institution. The most common computed tomography finding was a luminal filling defect obstructing the pulmonary artery (PA), without evidence of extraluminal extension. Three patients underwent debulking/pulmonary endarterectomy alone and 5 patients underwent a more radical resection with PA patch angioplasty, PA resection and reconstruction, pulmonary valve replacement, and unilateral pneumonectomy. The mean postoperative survival in this series was 3.8 ± 3.6 years (range, 1-11.9 years), with 2 radical surgical resection patients alive at 4.9 and 11.9 years, respectively. For those patients with incomplete resection, 3-dimensional (3D) models were created to demonstrate the advantage of a preoperative guide for a more complete resection and what it would entail. Six patients had local recurrences with mean disease-free interval of 14 ± 10.9 months (range, 2 months-2.5 years), and 2 patients with re-resections had an overall postoperative survival of 2.8 and 11.9 years, respectively. In our small cohort of PPAS, patients treated with radical surgical resection had better survival. The small number of PPAS cases in this series makes proving this association unlikely but warrants consideration.","Mahajan, Nandita N; Cicek, Sertac M; McGregor, Christopher G A; Boland, Jennifer M; Morris, Jonathan M; Okuno, Scott H; Robinson, Steven I; White, Darin B; Yi, Eunhee S; Blackmon, Shanda H",Innovations,213,1

Concomitant poor bone quality, unstable fracture patterns, and suboptimal reduction are additional risk factors for early mechanical failure. Cement augmentation of the proximal locking screw or blade is one proposed method to augment implant anchorage. The purpose of this review is to describe the biomechanical and clinical evidence for cement augmentation of geriatric intertrochanteric fractures, and to elaborate indications for cement augmentation. METHODS The PubMed database was searched for English language studies up to January 2021. Studies that assessed effect of calcium phosphate or methylmethacrylate cement augmentation during open reduction and internal fixation of intertrochanteric fractures were included. Studies with sample size < 5, nontraumatic or periprosthetic fractures, and nonunion or revision surgery were excluded. Study selection adhered to PRISMA criteria. RESULTS 801 studies were identified, of which 40 met study criteria. 9 studies assessed effect of cement augmentation on fracture displacement. All but one found that cement decreased fracture displacement. 10 studies assessed effect of cement augmentation on total load or cycles to failure. All but one demonstrated that augmented implants increased this variable. Complication rates of cement augmentation during ORIF of intertrochanteric fractures ranged from 0 to 47%, while non-augmented implants ranged from 0 to 51%. Reoperation rates ranged from 0 to 11% in the cement-augmented group and 0 to 11% in the non-augmented group. Fixation failure ranged from 0 to 11% in the cement-augmented group and 0 to 20% in the non-augmented group. Nonunion ranged from 0 to 3.6% in the cement-augmented group and 0 to 34% in the non-augmented group. CONCLUSIONS Calcium phosphate or PMMA-augmented CMN fixation of IT fractures increased construct stability and improved outcomes in biomechanical and early clinical studies. The findings of these studies suggest an important role for cement augmentation in patient populations at high risk of mechanical failure.","Goodnough, L Henry; Wadhwa, Harsh; Tigchelaar, Seth S; DeBaun, Malcolm R; Chen, Michael J; Graves, Matt L; Gardner, Michael J",Archives of orthopaedic and trauma surgery,213,16

This study aimed to evaluate the prevalence and related risk factors for anxiety and depression in patients with COVID-19. METHODS A cross-sectional study was performed on patients with COVID-19 admitted to the Sino-French New City branch of Wuhan Tongji Hospital from January to February 2020. The Zung Self-Rating Anxiety and Depression Scales were used to evaluate the prevalence of anxiety and depression. Demographic, clinical, and sociological data were also collected. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to identify independent risk factors of anxiety and depression in patients with COVID-19. RESULTS In the current study, 183 patients were enrolled (mean age = 53 ± 9 years; 41.1% women). The prevalences of anxiety and depression were 56.3% and 39.3%, respectively. Logistic regression analysis revealed that older age, female sex, being divorced or widowed, COVID-19 disease duration, renal disease, and depression were identified as independent risk factors for anxiety in patients with COVID-19. Factors that were associated with depression were female sex, being widowed, COVID-19 disease duration, and anxiety. CONCLUSIONS This study demonstrates a high prevalence of anxiety and depression in patients with COVID-19 at the peak of the epidemic in Wuhan, China.

Various researchers are trying to design a vaccine candidate against the virus. On the other hand, another group is focussing on repurposing approved or clinically tested drugs for treatment. However, there is always a search for alternative therapies. Thus, we propose an alternative approach apart from chemotherapy that is the usage of miRNA as novel antisense therapy to cure SARS CoV2 infected patients. To address the objective, miRNAs have been designed by targeting the genome of SARS CoV2 (Indian isolate). First, the open reading frames in the viral genome have been identified, and the proteins encoded by those open reading frames have been predicted. Using computational biology, several miRNAs have been designed and their probability to bind to a viral gene has been predicted. In addition, miRNA target mining in the host cell has been done to rule out the possibility of non-specific binding of the miRNAs. The miRNAs having the highest chances to bind to the viral genome have been converted into pre-miRNAs, and their interaction with dicer endoribonuclease has been studied by molecular docking. Results revealed that the pre-miRNAs interact with the RNAse III 2 domain of dicer. Thus, it is predicted that the pre-miRNAs after delivery to the infected host cell will be processed by dicer to generate mature miRNAs that will target the SARS CoV2 viral genome. Therefore, miRNA therapy can be an alternative approach for the treatment of SARS CoV2 infection.","Devi, Arpita; Chaitanya, Nyshadham S N",IUBMB life,213,1

Concern for viral transmission necessitates the investigation of otologic procedures that use high-speed drilling instruments, including mastoidectomy, which we hypothesized to be an aerosol-generating procedure. METHODS Mastoidectomy with a high-speed drill was simulated using fresh-frozen cadaveric heads with fluorescein solution injected into the mastoid air cells. Specimens were drilled for 1-minute durations in test conditions with and without a microscope. A barrier drape was fashioned from a commercially available drape (the OtoTent). Dispersed particulate matter was quantified in segments of an octagonal test grid measuring 60 cm in radius. RESULTS Drilling without a microscope dispersed fluorescent particles 360 degrees, with the areas of highest density in quadrants near the surgeon and close to the surgical site. Using a microscope or varying irrigation rates did not significantly reduce particle density or percent surface area with particulate. Using the OtoTent significantly reduced particle density and percent surface area with particulate across the segments of the test grid beyond 30 cm (which marked the boundary of the OtoTent) compared with the microscope only and no microscope test conditions (Kruskall-Wallis test, p = 0.0066). CONCLUSIONS Mastoidectomy with a high-speed drill is an aerosol-generating procedure, a designation that connotes the potential high risk of viral transmission and need for higher levels of personal protective equipment. A simple barrier drape significantly reduced particulate dispersion in this study and could be an effective mitigation strategy in addition to appropriate personal protective equipment.","Chen, Jenny X; Workman, Alan D; Chari, Divya A; Jung, David H; Kozin, Elliott D; Lee, Daniel J; Welling, D Bradley; Bleier, Benjamin S; Quesnel, Alicia M","Otology & neurotology : official publication of the American Otological Society, American Neurotology Society [and] European Academy of Otology and Neurotology",213,1

We have engineered a vitreous substitute comprised of a novel hyaluronan-oxime crosslinked hydrogel. Hyaluronan, which is naturally abundant in the vitreous of the eye, is chemically modified to crosslink with poly(ethylene glycol)-tetraoxyamine via oxime chemistry to produce a vitreous substitute that has similar physical properties to the native vitreous including refractive index, density and transparency. The oxime hydrogel is cytocompatible in vitro with photoreceptors from mouse retinal explants and biocompatible in rabbit eyes as determined by histology of the inner nuclear layer and photoreceptors in the outer nuclear layer. The ocular pressure in the rabbit eyes was consistent over 56 d, demonstrating limited to no swelling. Our vitreous substitute was stable in vivo over 28 d after which it began to degrade, with approximately 50% loss by day 56. We confirmed that the implanted hydrogel did not impact retina function using electroretinography over 90 days versus eyes injected with balanced saline solution.

AREAS COVERED MicroRNA (miRNA), a class of ncRNA, regulates post-transcription gene expression through the binding of complementary binding sites of target messenger RNA (mRNA) with resulting translational repression. Small interfering RNA (siRNA) are double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) that regulate gene expression, leading to selective silencing of genes through a process called RNA interference (RNAi). Another form of RNAi involves short hairpin RNA (shRNA). In age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and in diabetic retinopathy (DR), miRNA has been implicated in the regulation of angiogenesis, oxidative stress, immune response, and inflammation. EXPERT OPINION Many RNA-based therapies in development are conveniently administered intravitreally, with potential for panretinal effect. The majority of these RNA therapeutics are synthetic ncRNA's and hold promise for the treatment of AMD, DR and inherited retinal diseases (IRDs). These RNA-based therapies include siRNA therapy with its high specificity, shRNA to ""knock down"" autosomal dominant toxic gain of function mutated genes, antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs), which can restore splicing defects, and translational read-through inducing drugs (TRIDS) to increase expression of full-length protein from genes with premature stop codons.","Gemayel, Michael C; Bhatwadekar, Ashay D; Ciulla, Thomas",Expert opinion on biological therapy,213,33

The aim of this randomized controlled study was to test this hypothesis by comparing the expiratory tidal volume (Vte) between NMV and FMV. METHODS After the induction of anesthesia, 41 subjects, 3-17 years of age without anticipated difficult mask ventilation, were randomly assigned to receive either NMV or FMV with neck extension. Both groups were ventilated with pressure control ventilation (PCV) at 20 cmH2 O of peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) with positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) levels of 0, 5, and 10 cmH2 O. An additional mouth closing maneuver (MCM) was applied for the NMV group. RESULTS The Vte was higher in the FMV group compared with the NMV group (median difference [95% CI]: 8.4 [5.5-11.6] ml·kg(-1) ; P < 0.001) when MCM was not applied. NMV achieved less PEEP than FMV (median difference [95% CI]: 5.0 [4.3-5.3] cmH2 O at 10 cmH2 O; P < 0.001) though both groups achieved the set PIP level. In the NMV group, MCM markedly increased Vte (median increase [95% CI]: 5.9 [2.5-9.0] ml·kg(-1) ; P < 0.005) and PEEP (median increase [95% CI]: 5.0 [0.6-8.6] cmH2 O at 10 cmH2 O; P < 0.005); however, PEEP was highly variable and lower than that of FMV (median difference [95% CI]: 2.5 [0.8-8.5] cmH2 O at 10 cmH2 O; P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS In anesthetized, apneic children greater than 2 years of age ventilated with an anesthesia ventilator and neck extension, FMV established a greater Vte than NMV regardless of mouth status. NMV could not maintain the set PEEP level due to an air leak from the mouth. The MCM increased the Vte and PEEP.","Itagaki, Taiga; Gubin, Tatyana A; Sayal, Puneet; Jiang, Yandong; Kacmarek, Robert M; Anderson, Thomas Anthony",Paediatric anaesthesia,213,1

METHODS Patients hospitalized at the Stroke Center of the University Hospital Basel, Switzerland, with an acute ischaemic stroke confirmed on magnetic resonance diffusion-weighted imaging were included. Neurological deficits of the included patients were non-disabling, i.e. not interfering with activities of daily living and compatible with a direct discharge home. Patients with premorbid disability were excluded. All patients were admitted to the Stroke Center for ≥24 h. Two study groups were compared - fast-track hospitalizations (≤72 h) and long-term hospitalizations (>72 h). The primary end-point was a composite of any unplanned rehospitalization for any reason within 3 months since hospital discharge and a modified Rankin Scale 3-6 at 3 months. Adjustment for confounders was done using the inverse probability of treatment weights (IPTW). RESULTS Amongst the 521 patients who met the inclusion criteria, fast-track hospitalizations were performed in 79 patients (15%). In the fast-track group, seven patients (8.9%) met the primary end-point, compared to 37 (8.4%) in the long-term group [odds ratio (OR) 1.06, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.42-2.34, P = 0.88]. After weighting for IPTW, the odds of the primary end-point remained similar between the two arms (ORIPTW 1.27, 95% CI 0.51-3.16, P = 0.61). The costs of fast-track hospitalizations were lower, on average, by $4994. CONCLUSIONS Fast-track hospitalizations including a full workup proved to be feasible, showed no increased risk and were less expensive than long-term hospitalizations.","Fladt, J; Hofmann, L; Coslovsky, M; Imhof, A; Seiffge, D J; Polymeris, A; Thilemann, S; Traenka, C; Sutter, R; Schaer, B; Kaufmann, B A; Peters, N; Bonati, L H; Engelter, S T; Lyrer, P A; De Marchis, G M",European journal of neurology,213,16

A point-of-care influenza test and laboratory direct immunofluorescence tests for common respiratory viruses were used for diagnosis. We achieved early identification of seven respiratory disease outbreaks, two of which were caused by influenza. For the influenza outbreaks, antiviral treatment and prophylaxis were initiated 4-6 days from symptom onset in the primary case. A simple active surveillance system for influenza was successfully implemented and resulted in early detection of influenza and other respiratory disease outbreaks. This enabled earlier implementation of prevention and control measures and increased the potential effectiveness of anti-influenza chemoprophylaxis.","Rosewell, A; Chiu, C; Lindley, R; Dwyer, D E; Moffatt, C R M; Shineberg, C; Clarke, E; Booy, R; MacIntyre, C R",Epidemiology and infection,213,12

However, testing complex hypotheses or a network of ethnobiological hypotheses is challenging, particularly for data sets with non-independent observations due to species phylogenetic relatedness or socio-relational links between participants. Further, to account fully for the dynamics of local ecological knowledge, it is important to include the spatially explicit distribution of knowledge, changes in knowledge, and knowledge transmission and use. To promote the use of advanced statistical modelling approaches that address these limitations, we synthesize methodological advances for hypothesis-driven research in ethnobiology while highlighting the need for more figures than tables and more tables than text in ethnobiological literature. We present the ethnobiological motivations for conducting generalized linear mixed-effect modelling, structural equation modelling, phylogenetic generalized least squares, social network analysis, species distribution modelling, and predictive modelling. For each element of the proposed ethnobiologists quantitative toolbox, we present practical applications along with scripts for a widespread implementation. Because these statistical modelling approaches are rarely taught in most ethnobiological programs but are essential for careers in academia or industry, it is critical to promote workshops and short courses focused on these advanced methods. By embracing these quantitative modelling techniques without sacrificing qualitative approaches which provide essential context, ethnobiology will progress further towards an expansive interaction with other disciplines.","Gaoue, Orou G; Moutouama, Jacob K; Coe, Michael A; Bond, Matthew O; Green, Elizabeth; Sero, Nadejda B; Bezeng, Bezeng S; Yessoufou, Kowiyou",Biological reviews of the Cambridge Philosophical Society,213,31

This study compared the short- and long-term outcomes of patients with multifocal tumors meeting the University of California San Francisco (UCSF) criteria after HR plus intraoperative RFA or HR alone. METHODS A total of 261 consecutive patients with multifocal HCCs meeting the UCSF criteria from January 2010 to January 2018, who underwent combined treatment (n = 51) or HR (n = 210), were included. Propensity score matching was performed to adjust for baseline differences. Overall survival (OS) and recurrence-free survival (RFS) were calculated, and subgroup analysis, along with univariate and multivariate analyses, were performed. RESULTS The 1-, 3-, and 5-year OS rates after combined treatment or HR alone were 86.3%, 66.6%, and 34.2%, and 92.8%, 67.1%, and 37%, respectively (p = 0.423); combined treatment provided similar RFS rates as HR at 1, 3, and 5 years (78.4%, 35.8% and 20.9% vs. 82.6%, 50.4% and 24.5%, respectively; p = 0.076). The propensity matching model showed similar results. Subgroup analysis showed that HR was associated with better RFS than HR plus RFA for patients with two tumors or major tumors ≤ 3 cm. Multivariate analysis revealed that portal hypertension and three tumors are independent risk factors. CONCLUSIONS For multifocal HCC patients meeting the UCSF criteria, combined treatment may offer similar OS and RFS as HR; however, HR may be more suitable than combined treatment for patients with two tumors or major tumors ≤ 3 cm.","Huang, Yang; Song, Jiulin; Zheng, Jinli; Jiang, Li; Yan, Lunan; Yang, Jiayin; Zeng, Yong; Wu, Hong",Annals of surgical oncology,213,16

Although effective treatments exist, OCD often remains underdetected and undertreated. METHODS The authors performed a scoping review of the literature (of articles in PubMed and PsycINFO published from January 1, 2000, to February 1, 2020) to define gaps in OCD diagnosis and treatment among U.S. adults. Interventions at the patient, clinician, and health care system levels used to address these gaps are described, and promising approaches from around the world are highlighted. RESULTS Of 102 potential studies identified in the search, 27 (including five non-U.S. studies) were included. The studies revealed that lack of clinician and patient knowledge about OCD and misdiagnosis contributes to its underdetection. Suboptimal prescribing of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor medications and limited use of exposure and response prevention, as a first-line psychotherapy, contribute to OCD undertreatment. Digital health technologies show promise in increasing OCD detection and delivery of evidence-based care and in ensuring continuity of care (including during the COVID-19 pandemic). CONCLUSIONS Given the significant rates of disability, morbidity, and mortality associated with OCD, addressing gaps in OCD care will reduce the U.S. burden of mental illness.

Genomics has advanced the neurobiological understanding that underpins ACEs, wellness, and disease, which are modulated through stress pathways and epigenetic modifications. While data are currently limited, children with developmental disabilities have an increased ACE risk compared to typically developing peers. This recognition has important ramifications for health and policy interventions that address the root causes of ACEs, especially in this vulnerable population. With increased societal recognition, advances in policy will lead to medical, financial, and public benefits in years to come, hopefully changing healthcare models from 'sick care' to 'well care'.","Morgart, Kiley; Harrison, Joyce Nolan; Hoon, Alexander H; Wilms Floet, Anna Maria",Developmental medicine and child neurology,213,17

As preventive medicine and health screening examinations are now becoming commonplace, the incidental detection of papillomacular bundle defect (PMBD) on fundus photography has been increasing. However, clinical significance of incidental PMBD has not been well documented to date. Thus, through long-term and longitudinal observation, we aimed to investigate the risk factors for the development and progression of PMBD and its predictive role associated with systemic diseases and glaucoma. Methods This longitudinal study included subjects who had undergone standardized health screening. We retrospectively reviewed patients for whom PMBD had been detected in fundus photography and followed up for more than 5 years. For a comparative analysis, non-PMBD groups of age- and gender-matched healthy controls were selected. Results A total of about 67,000 fundus photographs were analyzed for 8.0 years, and 587 PMBD eyes were found. Among them, 234 eyes of 234 patients who had had fundus photographs taken for more than 5 years were finally included. A total of 216 eyes (92.3%) did not progress during the 8.1 ± 2.7 years, whereas 18 eyes (7.7%) showed progression at 7.6 ± 2.9 years after initial detection. A multivariate logistic regression analysis using 224 non-PMBD healthy controls revealed low body mass index (BMI < 20 kg/m2), systemic hypertension, and sclerotic changes of retinal artery as the significant risk factors for the development of PMBD. Regarding PMBD progression, low BMI, concomitant retinal nerve fiber layer defect (RNFLD) at non-PMB sites, optic disc hemorrhage, and higher vertical cup/disc ratio were individual significant risk factors. Conclusion PMBD is associated with ischemic effects. Although the majority of PMBD do not progress, some of cases are associated with glaucomatous damage in a long-term way. PMBD might be a personalized indicator representing ischemia-associated diseases and a predictive factor for diagnosis and preventive management of glaucoma.","Baek, Sung Uk; Lee, Won June; Park, Ki Ho; Choi, Hyuk Jin",The EPMA journal,213,7

RESULTS There were 824 orthopaedic referrals and 358 admissions (six/day) in the non-COVID period, with 38/358 (10.6%) admissions having a psychiatric diagnosis and 30/358 (8.4%) also having a fracture. This was compared with 473 referrals and 195 admissions (three/day) in the COVID period, with 73/195 (37.4%) admissions having a documented psychiatric diagnosis and 47/195 (24.1%) having a fracture. DISCUSSION There was a reduction in the number of admissions and referrals during the pandemic, but a simultaneous three-fold rise in admissions with a psychiatric diagnosis. The proportion of patients with both a fracture and a psychiatric diagnosis more than doubled and the number of patients presenting due to a traumatic suicide attempt almost tripled. CONCLUSION While total numbers using the orthopaedic service decreased, the impact of the pandemic and lockdown disproportionately affects those with mental health problems, a group already at higher risk of poorer functional outcomes and non-union. It is imperative that adequate support is in place for patients with vulnerable mental health during these periods, particularly as we look towards a potential 'second wave' of COVID-19.","Hay, D; Jamal, M S; Al-Tawil, K; Petohazi, A; Gulli, V; Bednarczuk, N F; Baldwin-Smith, R; Gibbons, J; Sinha, J",Annals of the Royal College of Surgeons of England,213,1

A narrow-line-width rugate filter, a one-dimensional photonic crystal, is fabricated that exhibits a high-reflectivity optical resonance that is sensitive to small changes in the refractive index at the pore walls. To immobilize peptide in the pore of the photonic crystal, the hydrogen-terminated silicon surface was first modified with the alkene 10-succinimidyl undecenoate via hydrosilylation. The monolayer with the succinimide ester moiety at the distal end served the dual function of protecting the underlying silicon from oxidation as well as providing a surface suitable for subsequent derivatization with amines. The surface was further modified with 1-aminohexa(ethylene glycol) (EG(6)) to resist nonspecific adsorption of proteins common in complex biological samples. The distal hydroxyl of the EG(6) is activated using the solid-phase coupling reagent disuccinimidyl carbonate for selective immobilization of peptides as protease recognition elements. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis reveals high activation and coupling efficiency at each stage of the functionalization. Exposure of the peptide-modified crystals to the protease subtilisin in solution causes a change in the refractive index, resulting in a shift of the resonance to shorter wavelengths, indicating cleavage of organic material within the pores. The lowest detected concentration of enzyme was 37 nM (7.4 pmol in 200 microL).","Kilian, Kristopher A; Böcking, Till; Gaus, Katharina; Gal, Michael; Gooding, J Justin",ACS nano,213,17

They lead to a pseudo-normalisation of the water diffusivity and transverse relaxation time maps in the subacute and chronic phases of stroke. Within the context of diffusion MRI, the free water elimination and mapping method (FWE) with echo time dependence has been proposed as a promising approach to measure the amount of free fluid in brain tissue robustly and to eliminate its biasing effect on other biomarkers. In this longitudinal study of transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAo) in the rat brain, we investigated the use of FWE MRI with echo time dependence for the characterisation of the tissue microstructure and explored the potential of the free water fraction as a novel biomarker of ischaemic tissue condition. METHODS Adult rats received a transient MCAo. Diffusion- and transverse relaxation-weighted MRI experiments were performed longitudinally, pre-occlusion and on days 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 10 after MCAo on four rats. Histology was performed for non-stroke and 1, 3 and 10 days after MCAo on three different rats at each time point. RESULTS The free water fraction was homogeneously increased in the ischaemic cortex one day after stroke. Between three and ten days after stroke, the core of the ischaemic tissue showed a progressive normalisation in the amount of free water, whereas the inner and outer border zones of the ischaemic cortex depicted a large, monotonous increase with time. The specific lesions in brain sections were verified by H&E and immunostaining. The tissue-specific diffusion and relaxometry MRI metrics in the ischaemic cortex were significantly different compared to their conventional counterpart. CONCLUSIONS Our results demonstrate that the free water fraction in FWE MRI with echo time dependence is a valuable biomarker, sensitive to the progressive degeneration in ischaemic tissue. We showed that part of the heterogeneity previously observed in conventional parameter maps can be accounted for by a heterogeneous distribution of free water in the tissue. Our results suggest that the temporal evolution of the free fluid fraction map at the core and inner border zone can be associated with the pathological changes linked to the evolution of vasogenic oedema. Namely, the homogeneous increase in free water one day after stroke and its tendency to normalise in the core of the ischaemic cortex starting three days after stroke, followed by a progressive increase in free water at the inner border zone from three to ten days after stroke. Finally, the monotonous increase in free fluid in the outer border zones of the cortex reflects the formation of fluid-filled cysts.","Farrher, Ezequiel; Chiang, Chia-Wen; Cho, Kuan-Hung; Grinberg, Farida; Buschbeck, Richard P; Chen, Ming-Jye; Wu, Kuo-Jen; Wang, Yun; Huang, Sheng-Min; Abbas, Zaheer; Choi, Chang-Hoon; Shah, N Jon; Kuo, Li-Wei",NeuroImage,213,1

Recently, SMART Coils (Penumbra Inc., Alameda, California, USA) have been developed, which transition in softness along the length of their coils. We report the initial clinical results with this technology. METHODS A retrospective study of all patients undergoing aneurysm coiling with SMART Coils at 2 centers was performed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of this new technology. Outcome and angiographic data were self-reported by individual treatment centers. RESULTS Fifty-nine patients underwent treatment for cerebral aneurysms with SMART Coils (44% in the setting of subarachnoid hemorrhage). Mean aneurysm size was 5.9 ± 2 mm × 4.5 ± 2 mm. Mean neck size was 3.4 ± 1 mm. More than half (54.2%) of the patients underwent coiling exclusively with SMART Coils. The remainder used either framing or finishing coils of another type. About one third (33.9%) underwent balloon-assisted coiling, and 47.5% underwent stent-assisted coiling. There were no device malfunctions in any of the patients. Six (10.1%) minor complications without clinical sequelae occurred. Raymond I or II occlusion was achieved in 71.2%. CONCLUSIONS Our results demonstrate adequate device safety in a variety of both ruptured and unruptured aneurysm locations. This design enables progressive changes in softness along the length of an individual coil, which offers several potential advantages in the clinical use. This initial investigation of SMART Coil technology demonstrates safety and efficacy in the treatment of a wide range of aneurysm sizes, locations, and morphologies in both ruptured and unruptured settings.","Spiotta, Alejandro M; Fargen, Kyle M; Lena, Jonathan; Chaudry, Imran; Turner, Raymond D; Turk, Aquilla S; Huddle, Daniel; Loy, David; Bellon, Richard; Frei, Donald",World neurosurgery,213,31

The high altitude tribes are thought to be genetically and environmentally protected from hypertension (HTN) like diseases. Objective The objective is to estimate the prevalence of HTN among tribes residing at high altitudes (>6000 feet above sea level) of India. Methods The meta-analysis was undertaken during March to August 2018. National Library of Medicine's PubMed database, and Google scholar were comprehensively searched including search terms such as ""blood pressure, hypertension and prevalence"" combined with ""tribal, tribes, high altitude, India."" Articles on the prevalence of HTN were searched first and then were segregated on the basis of high altitude (>6000 ft). Results Initially, 69 references and a total of 16 abstracts were screened. After applying the inclusion and exclusion criteria on 16, eight studies were included. Meta-analysis of the prevalence of selected studies resulted in a pooled estimate mean prevalence of HTN among tribal population to be 11.43% (95% confidence interval: 6.72%-17.21%).

We studied prostate cancer (PCa) protein-protein interaction (PPI) network constructed from patients' gene expression datasets and found that the network exhibits hierarchical scale free topology which lacks centrality lethality rule. Knockout experiments of the sets of leading hubs from the network leads to transition from hierarchical (HN) to scale free (SF) topology affecting network integration and organization. This transition, HN → SF, due to removal of significant number of the highest degree hubs, leads to relatively decrease in information processing efficiency, cost effectiveness of signal propagation, compactness, clustering of nodes and energy distributions. A systematic transition from a diassortative PCa PPI network to assortative networks after the removal of top 50 hubs then again reverting to disassortativity nature on further removal of the hubs was also observed indicating the dominance of the largest hubs in PCa network intergration. Further, functional classification of the hubs done by using within module degrees and participation coefficients for PCa network, and leading hubs knockout experiments indicated that kinless hubs serve as the basis of establishing links among constituting modules and heterogeneous nodes to maintain network stabilization. We, then, checked the essentiality of the hubs in the knockout experiment by performing Fisher's exact test on the hubs, and showed that removal of kinless hubs corresponded to maximum lethality in the network. However, excess removal of these hubs essentially may cause network breakdown.","Mangangcha, Irengbam Rocky; Malik, Md Zubbair; Kucuk, Omer; Ali, Shakir; Singh, R K Brojen",Genomics,213,17

The primary hypothesis of this study was that fewer watershed tumors show complete response (CR) after chemoembolization, with shorter time to local recurrence. Secondary analysis on the impact on transplantation eligibility in the presence of progressive disease was also performed. MATERIALS AND METHODS A total of 155 transplantation-eligible patients whose HCC met Milan criteria (watershed, n = 83; nonwatershed, n = 72) and was treated with chemoembolization were included. Cone-beam computed tomography (CT) was used for guidance and for confirmation of circumferential uptake. Local response to chemoembolization per modified Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors and local disease-free survival (DFS) for the index tumor were calculated. Differences were assessed by univariate and multivariate analyses. RESULTS CR after a single of chemoembolization was observed in 55.4% of watershed tumors and in 72.2% of nonwatershed tumors (P = .045). Estimated DFS intervals were 151 days (95% confidence interval [CI], 93-245 d) and 336 days (95% CI, 231-747 d; P = .040) in the watershed and nonwatershed groups, respectively. Worse DFS was observed with a Model for End-Stage Liver Disease score > 20 (P = .0001), higher Child-Pugh-Turcotte score (P = .049), and watershed location (P = .040). Waiting list drop-off rates were statistically similar between groups. CONCLUSIONS Hepatocellular carcinomas located in the watershed region of the liver have a poorer response to chemoembolization than those located elsewhere. These tumors are associated with worse DFS and require additional treatments to maintain transplantation eligibility per Milan criteria. Cone-beam CT can identify crossover supply and confirm complete geographic drug uptake, possibly reducing (but not eliminating) the risk of incomplete response.","Kothary, Nishita; Takehana, Chris; Mueller, Kerstin; Sullivan, Patrick; Tahvildari, Ali; Sidhar, Vishal; Rosenberg, Jarrett; Louie, John D; Sze, Daniel Y",Journal of vascular and interventional radiology : JVIR,213,16

Changes in the bacterial niche could affect transmission dynamics. Attenuated vaccine viruses can be used to investigate this empirically in humans. OBJECTIVES To study the effects of mild viral upper respiratory infections on nasopharyngeal bacterial colonization using live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV) as a surrogate. METHODS We used trivalent LAIV to evaluate the effects of viral infection on bacterial carriage and density of Streptococcus pneumoniae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Haemophilus influenzae, and Staphylococcus aureus. A total of 151 healthy children were randomized 1:1 to receive the vaccine starting either at recruitment (n = 74) or 28 days later (n = 77) in a stepped wedge fashion, allowing comparisons between recipients and nonrecipients as well as whole-group comparisons pre- and postvaccination. Bacterial carriage and density were determined using quantitative polymerase chain reaction assays. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS A total of 151 children were recruited, 77 in the LAIV group and 74 in the control group. LAIV recipients (n = 63 analyzed) showed an apparent transient increase in H. influenzae carriage but no further significant differences in carriage prevalence of the four bacterial species compared with controls (n = 72 analyzed). S. pneumoniae density was substantially higher in vaccine recipients (16,687 vs. 1935 gene copies per milliliter) 28 days after the first dose (P < 0.001). Whole-group multivariable analysis (prevaccine, after one dose, and after two doses) also showed increases in density of other species and H. influenzae carriage prevalence. CONCLUSIONS In the absence of any safety signals despite widespread use of the vaccine, these findings suggest that bacterial density, and thus transmission rates among children and to people in other age groups, may rise following attenuated influenza infections without associated clinical disease. LAIV could therefore be used as an experimental tool to elucidate the dynamics of transmission of nasopharyngeal bacteria.","Thors, Valtyr; Christensen, Hannah; Morales-Aza, Begonia; Vipond, Ian; Muir, Peter; Finn, Adam",American journal of respiratory and critical care medicine,213,1

In individuals with hematological diseases such as cryoglobulinemia and certain B cell lymphoma forms, the RFs derived from specific heavy- and light-chain germline pairs, so-called ""stereotypic RFs,"" are frequently produced in copious amounts and form immune complexes with IgG in serum. Of note, many structural details of the antigen recognition mechanisms in RFs are unclear. Here we report the crystal structure of the RF YES8c derived from the IGHV1-69/IGKV3-20 germline pair, the most common of the stereotypic RFs, in complex with human IgG1-Fc at 2.8 Å resolution. We observed that YES8c binds to the CH2-CH3 elbow in the canonical antigen-binding manner involving a large antigen-antibody interface. On the basis of this observation, combined with mutational analyses, we propose a recognition mechanism common to IGHV1-69/IGKV3-20 RFs: (1) the interaction of the Leu432-His435 region of Fc enables the highly variable complementarity-determining region (CDR)-H3 to participate in the binding, (2) the hydrophobic tip in the CDR-H2 typical of IGHV1-69 antibodies recognizes the hydrophobic patch on Fc, and (3) the interaction of the highly conserved RF light chain with Fc is important for RF activity. These features may determine the putative epitope common to the IGHV1-69/IGKV3-20 RFs. We also showed that some mutations in the binding site of RF increase the affinity to Fc, which may aggravate hematological diseases. Our findings unravel the structural basis for germline-encoded antibody autoreactivity.","Shiroishi, Mitsunori; Ito, Yuji; Shimokawa, Kenta; Lee, Jae Man; Kusakabe, Takahiro; Ueda, Tadashi",The Journal of biological chemistry,213,1

This systematic review and meta-analysis was performed to evaluate 30-day all-cause mortality comparing TRA with transfemoral access for percutaneous coronary intervention in patients with ST-segment-elevation myocardial infarction. METHODS We performed a systematic literature search and meta-analysis of randomized controlled studies published from inception until January 7, 2020, in MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and Web of Science Core Collection. Preferred Reported Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines were used for abstracting data. The primary outcome was all-cause mortality at 30 days. Secondary outcomes included myocardial infarction, major bleeding, stroke, and access site complications. RESULTS A total of 14 studies representing 11 707 patients (5802 patients with TRA; 5905 patients with transfemoral access) were included in this systematic review. All-cause mortality (N=8 studies) was significantly reduced in the TRA group with an overall risk ratio (RR) of 0.72 (95% CI, 0.56-0.92) in the pooled analysis. Major bleeding (N=12 studies; RR, 0.60 [95% CI, 0.45-0.80]) and access site complications (N=9 studies; RR, 0.40 [95% CI, 0.30-0.53]) were significantly higher in the transfemoral access group.

The total sperm count, sperm concentration, and number of motile spermatozoa per ejaculate were significantly increased and the percentage of morphologically abnormal sperm was reduced at the second sampling compared with those at first in the 22 patients examined. Though there were higher prolactin and lower progesterone levels in patients at first sampling than those in controls, no significant alterations were detected for any sex hormones examined over time following COVID-19 recovery in the 22 patients. Although it should be interpreted carefully, these findings indicate an adverse but potentially reversible consequence of COVID-19 on sperm quality.","Guo, Tong-Hang; Sang, Mei-Ying; Bai, Shun; Ma, Hui; Wan, Yang-Yang; Jiang, Xiao-Hua; Zhang, Yuan-Wei; Xu, Bo; Chen, Hong; Zheng, Xue-Ying; Luo, Si-Hui; Xie, Xue-Feng; Gong, Chen-Jia; Weng, Jian-Ping; Shi, Qing-Hua",Asian journal of andrology,213,17

The majority of published studies have investigated the fatty acid composition of phospholipids rather than lipids themselves. This study evaluated the lipid composition of asthenozoospermic and normozoospermic spermatozoa, and identified the exact lipid species that correlated with sperm motility. METHODS A total of 12 infertile asthenozoospermia patients and 12 normozoospermia subjects with normal sperm motility values were tested for semen volume, sperm concentration, count, motility, vitality and morphology. High-coverage targeted lipidomics with 25 individual lipid classes was performed to analyze the sperm lipid components and establish the exact lipid species that correlated with sperm motility. RESULTS A total of 25 individual lipid classes and 479 lipid molecular species were identified and quantified. Asthenozoospermic spermatozoa showed an increase in the level of four lipid classes, including Cho, PE, LPI and GM3. A total of 48 lipid molecular species were significantly altered between normozoospermic and asthenozoospermic spermatozoa. Furthermore, the levels of total GM3 and six GM3 molecular species, which were altered in normozoospermic spermatozoa versus asthenozoospermic spermatozoa, were inversely correlated with sperm progressive and total motility. CONCLUSIONS Several unique lipid classes and lipid molecular species were significantly altered between asthenozoospermic and normozoospermic spermatozoa, revealing new possibilities for further mechanistic pursuits and highlighting the development needs of culture medium formulations to improve sperm motility.","Chen, Shuqiang; Wang, Ming; Li, Li; Wang, Jun; Ma, Xuhui; Zhang, Hengde; Cai, Yang; Kang, Bin; Huang, Jianlei; Li, Bo",Reproductive biology and endocrinology : RB&E,213,11

Given the rapid acceleration of new cases and the common sense of global urgency, COVID-19 is subject to thorough measurement on a country-by-country basis. The world is witnessing an increasing demand for reliable data and impactful information on the novel disease. Can we trust the data on the COVID-19 spread worldwide? This study aims to assess the reliability of COVID-19 global data as disclosed by local authorities in 202 countries. It is commonly accepted that the frequency distribution of leading digits of COVID-19 data shall comply with Benford's law. In this context, the author collected and statistically assessed 106,274 records of daily infections, deaths, and tests around the world. The analysis of worldwide data suggests good agreement between theory and reported incidents. Approximately 69% of countries worldwide show some deviations from Benford's law. The author found that records of daily infections, deaths, and tests from 28% of countries adhered well to the anticipated frequency of first digits. By contrast, six countries disclosed pandemic data that do not comply with the first-digit law. With over 82 million citizens, Germany publishes the most reliable records on the COVID-19 spread. In contrast, the Islamic Republic of Iran provides by far the most non-compliant data. The author concludes that inconsistencies with Benford's law might be a strong indicator of artificially fabricated data on the spread of SARS-CoV-2 by local authorities. Partially consistent with prior research, the United States, Germany, France, Australia, Japan, and China reveal data that satisfies Benford's law. Unification of reporting procedures and policies globally could improve the quality of data and thus the fight against the deadly virus.","Farhadi, Noah",Science progress,213,1

However, uncertainties of the underlying mechanisms of multiple organ involvement remain. A substantial proportion of severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients have lymphopenia, low serum iron levels, and multiple organ involvement. Several therapeutic agents have been used for different stages of the disease, but the treatment for severe disease is still suboptimal. Understanding the mechanism of programmed cell death in COVID-19 may lead to better therapeutic strategies for these patients. On the basis of observations of basic science studies and clinical researches on COVID-19, we hypothesize that ferroptosis, a novel programmed cell death, may be an important cause of multiple organ involvement in COVID-19 and it might serve as a new treatment target. In spite of the existing findings on the involvement of ferroptosis in SARS-CoV-2 infection, there is no reported study to uncover how does ferroptosis acts in SARS-CoV-2 infection yet. Uncovering the role of ferroptosis in SARS-CoV-2 infection is essential to develop new treatment strategies for COVID-19. Intracellular cell iron depletion or new generation of ferroptosis inhibitors might be potential drug candidates for COVID-19. We hope this hypothesis may launch a new wave of studies to uncover the association of ferroptosis and SARS-CoV-2 infection in vitro and in vivo.","Yang, Ming; Lai, Ching Lung",Cell death discovery,213,27

As an enzyme, CD13 regulates activities of numerous cytokines by cleaving their N-terminals and is involved in Ag processing by trimming the peptides bound to MHC class II. Independent of its enzymatic activity, cell membrane CD13 functions by cross-linking-induced signal transduction, regulation of receptor recycling, enhancement of FcγR-mediated phagocytosis, and acting as a receptor for cytokines. Moreover, soluble CD13 has multiple proinflammatory roles mediated by binding to G-protein-coupled receptors. CD13 not only modulates development and activities of immune-related cells, but also regulates functions of inflammatory mediators. Therefore, CD13 is important in the pathogenesis of various inflammatory disorders. Inhibitors of CD13 have shown impressive anti-inflammatory effects, but none of them has yet been used for clinical therapy of human inflammatory diseases. We reevaluate CD13's regulatory role in inflammation and suggest that CD13 could be a potential therapeutic target for inflammatory disorders.","Lu, Chenyang; Amin, Mohammad A; Fox, David A",Journal of immunology,213,1

These viruses have evolved viral methyltransferase(s) to methylate N-7 and 2'-O cap of their RNA; alternatively, they ""snatch"" host mRNA cap to form the 5' end of viral RNA. The function of 2'-O methylation of viral RNA cap is to mimic cellular mRNA and to evade host innate immune restriction. A cytoplasmic virus defective in 2'-O methylation is replicative, but its viral RNA lacks 2'-O methylation and is recognized and eliminated by the host immune response. Such a mutant virus could be rationally designed as a live attenuated vaccine. Here, we use Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), an important mosquito-borne flavivirus, to prove this novel vaccine concept. We show that JEV methyltransferase is responsible for both N-7 and 2'-O cap methylations as well as evasion of host innate immune response. Recombinant virus completely defective in 2'-O methylation was stable in cell culture after being passaged for >30 days. The mutant virus was attenuated in mice, elicited robust humoral and cellular immune responses, and retained the engineered mutation in vivo. A single dose of immunization induced full protection against lethal challenge with JEV strains in mice. Mechanistically, the attenuation phenotype was attributed to the enhanced sensitivity of the mutant virus to the antiviral effects of interferon and IFIT proteins. Collectively, the results demonstrate the feasibility of using 2'-O methylation-defective virus as a vaccine approach; this vaccine approach should be applicable to other flaviviruses and nonflaviviruses that encode their own viral 2'-O methyltransferases.","Li, Shi-Hua; Dong, Hongping; Li, Xiao-Feng; Xie, Xuping; Zhao, Hui; Deng, Yong-Qiang; Wang, Xiao-Yu; Ye, Qing; Zhu, Shun-Ya; Wang, Hong-Jiang; Zhang, Bo; Leng, Qi-Bin; Zuest, Roland; Qin, E-De; Qin, Cheng-Feng; Shi, Pei-Yong",Journal of virology,213,12

Middle-income countries (MICs) typically lack the resources and regulatory capacities to pursue strategies that wealthier countries do, but they also face different sets of challenges and opportunities than low-income countries (LICs). We focus on three dimensions of vaccination: procurement and production; regulation of marketing registration; and distribution and uptake. For each dimension we show the distinct challenges and opportunities faced by MICs. We illustrate these challenges and opportunities with the case of Brazil, showing how each dimension has been affected by intense political conflicts. Brazil's procurement and production strategy, which builds on a long trajectory of local production and technology transfer, has been riddled by conflicts between the national government and state governments. The regulatory approval process, based around one of Latin America's most highly-regarded regulatory authorities, has also been subject to acute inter- and intra-governmental conflicts. And with regard to distribution and uptake, in the face of high uncertainty, even with a solid health infrastructure, Brazil encounters difficulties in promoting vaccine delivery. The research also reveals the importance of coordination among these dimensions, in Brazil and beyond. Pandemic preparedness and response must include sharing knowledge of how to produce vaccines and recognition of the crucial linkages between procurement, regulation, delivery, and uptake that are necessary for ensuring access to these products.","Fonseca, Elize Massard da; Shadlen, Kenneth C; Bastos, Francisco I",Social science & medicine,213,33

This study aimed to investigate enhancement of the thoracic aorta using caudocranial scan direction and a patient-specific contrast regimen. METHODS Electrocardiogram-gated (n = 120) and non-gated (n = 200) thoracic computed tomography angiography was performed on patients with nontraumatic acute aortic syndrome. Patients were assigned to one of 2 acquisition/contrast regimens, namely, regimen A, craniocaudal scan direction with 120 mL contrast, and regimen B, caudocranial scan direction using a patient-specific contrast formula. Opacity of 9 arterial and venous segments was measured, arteriovenous contrast ratio calculated, and values compared using Mann-Whitney U statistics. Receiver operating characteristic analyses and visual grading characteristic assessed diagnostic efficacy and clinical image quality. Interobserver variations were investigated using κ methods. RESULTS Regimen B when compared to A, for both scanning/contrast techniques, demonstrated higher opacification in the aorta (P < 0.01) and lower opacification in the venous system (P < 0.0001). For protocol B, arteriovenous contrast ratio was significantly increased (P < 0.0001) and mean contrast volume reduced (P < 0.05) during gated [94 (10 mL)] and non-gated [78 (5 mL)] thoracic computed tomography angiography compared to A. Receiver operating characteristic analysis Az scores and interobserver agreement were significantly higher with regimen B than A (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS Caudocranial scan direction and injection timing based on patient-specific vessel dynamics can optimize artery opacification and diagnostic efficacy while reducing contrast volumes.","Saade, Charbel; Bourne, Roger; Wilkinson, Mark; Evanoff, Michael; Brennan, Patrick C",Journal of computer assisted tomography,213,30

But controversies still exist regarding its potential advantages and risks, especially for emergency surgery. The aim of this study was to evaluate the results of a single-port laparoscopic repair using straight laparoscopic instruments for the treatment of perforated duodenal ulcers. METHODS A prospective consecutive case series was conducted including all patients with a perforated duodenal ulcer who underwent a laparoscopic single-port repair at a single institution from January 2012 to June 2018. The operation was performed through a single port using conventional straight laparoscopic instruments and intra-corporeal knot tying techniques. RESULTS Out of 75 patients, simple closure of the perforation without omental patch was accomplished in 96% of cases. Conversion to an open operation was required in one patient (1.3%) due to a posterior duodenal perforation, and additional trocar placement was needed in another patient (1.3%). The mean incision length was 2.0 ± 0.2 cm. The mean operation time was 63.0 ± 26.6 min. Meantime a nasogastric tube remained in place was 2.9 ± 0.8 days. Mean duration of analgesic use was 2.8 ± 0.8 days. The rate of postoperative complications was 2.7%, including two patients with wound infections. There were no instances of intestinal leak or abscess. The postoperative hospital stay was 5.7 ± 1.2 days. CONCLUSION Laparoscopic single-port repair using conventional straight laparoscopic instruments with intra-corporeal knot tying technique was safe and feasible for patients with perforated duodenal ulcers with low risk factors. This method offers results comparable to those expected with the standard multiport laparoscopic approach with the addition of improved cosmetic outcomes.","Nguyen, Tri Huu; Dang, Thanh Nhu; Schnelldorfer, Thomas",World journal of surgery,213,29

In this phase II study, we investigated the efficacy and safety profiles of FTD/TPI in mCRC according to RAS mutation status. PATIENTS AND METHODS Eligible patients were mCRC refractory or intolerant to all standard therapies other than FTD/TPI and regorafenib. Patients received 4-week cycles of treatment with FTD/TPI (35 mg/m2, twice daily, days 1-5 and 8-12) and bevacizumab (5 mg/kg, days 1 and 15). The primary endpoint was disease control rate (DCR). The null hypothesis of DCR in both RAS wild-type (WT) and mutant (MUT) cohorts was 44%, assuming a one-sided significance level of 5.0%. The necessary sample size was estimated to be 49 patients (target sample size: 50 patients) for each cohort. RESULTS Between January and September 2018, 102 patients were enrolled, and 97 patients fulfilled the eligibility criteria (48 in the RAS WT cohort and 49 in the RAS MUT cohort). DCRs in the RAS WT and MUT cohort were 66.7% [90% confidence interval (CI), 53.9%-77.8%, P = 0.0013] and 55.1% (90% CI, 42.4%-67.3%, P = 0.0780), respectively.

DESIGN Parallel-group randomized multicenter pilot trial. SETTING Six ICUs in the United Kingdom participated between August 2009 and December 2010. PATIENTS One hundred patients (51 restrictive and 49 liberal groups). INTERVENTIONS Patients were randomized to a restrictive (Hb trigger, 70 g/L; target, 71-90 g/L) or liberal (90 g/L; target, 91-110 g/L) transfusion strategy for 14 days or the remainder of ICU stay, whichever was longest. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS Baseline comorbidity rates and illness severity were high, notably for ischemic heart disease (32%). The Hb difference among groups was 13.8 g/L (95% CI, 11.5-16.0 g/L); p<0.0001); mean Hb during intervention was 81.9 (SD, 5.1) versus 95.7 (6.3) g/L; 21.6% fewer patients in the restrictive group were transfused postrandomization (p<0.001) and received a median 1 (95% CI, 1-2; p=0.002) fewer RBC units. Protocol compliance was high. No major differences in organ dysfunction, duration of ventilation, infections, or cardiovascular complications were observed during intensive care and hospital follow-up. Mortality at 180 days postrandomization trended toward higher rates in the liberal group (55%) than in the restrictive group (37%); relative risk was 0.68 (95% CI, 0.44-1.05; p=0.073). This trend remained in a survival model adjusted for age, gender, ischemic heart disease, Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score, and total non-neurologic Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score at baseline (hazard ratio, 0.54 [95% CI, 0.28-1.03]; p=0.061).

Colonoscopy, utilized as either a primary screening tool or a follow-up exam when other screening tests are positive, has significantly contributed to these encouraging trends. However, it is well recognized that colonoscopy is not perfectly sensitive for the detection of neoplasia and that CRC can be diagnosed within a short interval following a colonoscopy that did not detect one. The literature surrounding these cases has rapidly expanded over the last decade. Specifically, studies aimed at understanding the frequency of these events and the likely explanations for their occurrence have been performed. This review will highlight current knowledge around the epidemiology of interval post colonoscopy CRC (PCCRC). The common explanations for these cancers including missed lesions, new lesions, and incompletely resected lesions will be reviewed and their contribution to interval PCCRC estimated. Finally, the relationship of these putative explanations to potential opportunities to prevent interval PCCRC will be explored. Current approaches to prevention largely center on consistent adherence to quality colonoscopy standards. Future approaches include advances in technology to better visualize the colon and adequately resect detected neoplasia. Finally, improvement in training as well as development of a culture of continuous quality improvement will be essential to maximize the benefits of colonoscopy in daily clinical practice.","Adler, Jeffrey; Robertson, Douglas J",The American journal of gastroenterology,213,17

Although research dissemination to participants and community stakeholders is a fundamental component of translational research, it rarely occurs. The objective of this study was to create a community-led, theory-based dissemination plan to engage local Black sexual minority men in an active dissemination process throughout a sexual health research study. Method. Seven focus groups (N = 38) were conducted with Black, cisgender sexual minority men aged 18 to 45 years. Findings were analyzed through thematic content analysis guided by McGuire's persuasive communication theory. Findings were used to draft a dissemination plan, which was then reviewed and edited by the study's community advisory board (CAB). The plan continues to be updated in response to community needs through CAB discussions. Results. Participants preferred messages concerning syphilis and other health concerns as well as information on local resources. Preferred sources included researchers working with trusted community organizations and leaders. Preferred channels included community events and social media, implemented with consistency. CAB feedback included expanding the target audience of dissemination efforts as well as the development of ideas for channels (i.e., events) and sources (i.e., community organizations and leaders). Additional revisions occurred in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Conclusion. Given the continued lack of research dissemination to participant and community stakeholders, the process of developing a community-led, theory-based dissemination plan may benefit and help guide researchers to adopt this practice. It is critical that participant and community stakeholder dissemination become more highly prioritized as we strive for public health improvements and the elimination of health disparities.","Sawyer, Simone; Grieb, Suzanne M; Long, Amanda; Tilchin, Carla; Clark, Charles; Greenbaum, Adena; Jennings, Jacky M",Health promotion practice,213,31

METHODS Planned post hoc analysis using patients from a previous randomized controlled study. Fiberoptic tracheoscopy was performed during the 24 h following extubation. In patients with >2 ischemic lesions, ulcer or tracheal rupture, fiberoptic tracheoscopy was repeated 2 weeks after the last extubation. Tracheal ischemic lesions were predefined based on a quantitative score. RESULTS Ninety-six adult patients were included in this study. Eighty (83 %) patients had at least one tracheal ischemic lesion. Thirty-seven (38 %) patients had a tracheal ischemia score > median score (5; IQ 1, 7). The most common tracheal ischemic lesion was ischemia (68 %), followed by hyperemia (54 %), ulcer (10 %), and tracheal rupture (1 %). Univariate analysis identified duration of neuromuscular-blocking agent use, overinflation of tracheal cuff (>30 cmH2O), percentage of P cuff determination >30 cmH2O, duration of assist-control ventilation, and plateau pressure as risk factors for having a tracheal ischemia score >5. Duration of assist-control mechanical ventilation was the only factor independently associated with tracheal ischemia score >5 [OR (95 % CI) 1.10 per hour (1.02-1.20)]. A fiberoptic tracheoscopy was performed 2 weeks after extubation in 22 patients. This examination was normal in all patients, except the one with tracheal rupture who had marked improvement. CONCLUSION Tracheal ischemic lesions are common in intubated, critically ill patients. Duration of assist-control mechanical ventilation through a tracheal tube is the only independent risk factor. These lesions healed in the majority of patients 2 weeks after extubation.","Touat, Lylia; Fournier, Clément; Ramon, Philippe; Salleron, Julia; Durocher, Alain; Nseir, Saad",Intensive care medicine,213,1

Stentriever thrombectomy with or without aspiration assistance was the predominant technique used in the 5 randomized controlled trials that demonstrated the superiority of endovascular thrombectomy. Other studies have highlighted the efficacy of a direct aspiration first-pass technique (ADAPT). METHODS To compare the angiographic and clinical outcomes of ADAPT versus stentriever thrombectomy in patients with emergent large vessel occlusions (ELVO) of the anterior intracranial circulation, the records of 134 patients who were treated between June 2012 and October 2015 were reviewed. RESULTS Within this cohort, 117 patients were eligible for evaluation. ADAPT was used in 47 patients, 20 (42.5%) of whom required rescue stentriever thrombectomy, and primary stentriever thrombectomy was performed in 70 patients. Patients in the ADAPT group were slightly younger than those in the stentriever group (63.5 vs 69.4 years; p = 0.04); however, there were no differences in the other baseline clinical or radiographic factors. Procedural time (54.0 vs 77.1 minutes; p < 0.01) and time to a Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction (TICI) scale score of 2b/3 recanalization (294.3 vs 346.7 minutes; p < 0.01) were significantly lower in patients undergoing ADAPT versus stentriever thrombectomy. The rates of TICI 2b/3 recanalization were similar between the ADAPT and stentriever groups (82.9% vs 71.4%; p = 0.19). There were no differences in the rates of symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage or procedural complications. The rates of good functional outcome (modified Rankin Scale Score 0-2) at 90 days were similar between the ADAPT and stentriever groups (48.9% vs 41.4%; p = 0.45), even when accounting for the subset of patients in the ADAPT group who required rescue stentriever thrombectomy. CONCLUSIONS The present study demonstrates that ADAPT and primary stentriever thrombectomy for acute ischemic stroke due to ELVO are equivalent with respect to the rates of TICI 2b/3 recanalization and 90-day mRS scores. Given the reduced procedural time and time to TICI 2b/3 recanalization with similar functional outcomes, an initial attempt at recanalization with ADAPT may be warranted prior to stentriever thrombectomy.","Stapleton, Christopher J; Leslie-Mazwi, Thabele M; Torok, Collin M; Hakimelahi, Reza; Hirsch, Joshua A; Yoo, Albert J; Rabinov, James D; Patel, Aman B",Journal of neurosurgery,213,25

Currently, there is no consensus on which surgical assessment tool to use in live gynaecologic surgery. The purpose of this review is to identify assessment tools measuring technical skills in gynaecologic surgery and evaluate the measurement characteristics of each tool. METHOD We utilized the scoping review methodology and searched PubMed, Medline, Embase and Cochrane. Inclusion criteria were studies that analysed assessment tools in live gynaecologic surgery. Kane's validity argument was applied to evaluate the assessment tools in the included studies. RESULTS Eight studies out of the 544 identified fulfilled the inclusion criteria. The assessment tools were categorised as global rating scales, global and procedure rating scales combined, procedure-specific rating scales or as a non-procedure-specific error assessment tool. CONCLUSION This scoping review presents the current different tools for observational assessment of technical skills in intraoperative, gynaecologic surgery. This scoping review can serve as a guide for surgical educators who want to apply a scale or a specific tool in surgical assessment.","Hennings, Louise Inkeri; Sørensen, Jette Led; Hybscmann, Jane; Strandbygaard, Jeanett",BMC medical education,213,24

Alphaviruses are a large group of positive-stranded RNA viruses that maintain their transmission and life cycles in both mosquitoes and mammals. However, there is little knowledge about how alphaviruses antagonize RNAi in both host organisms. In this study, we identified that Semliki Forest virus (SFV) capsid protein can efficiently suppress RNAi in both insect and mammalian cells by sequestrating dsRNA and siRNA. More importantly, when the VSR activity of SFV capsid was inactivated by reverse genetics, the resulting VSR-deficient SFV mutant showed severe replication defects in mammalian cells, which could be rescued by blocking the RNAi pathway. Besides, capsid protein of Sindbis virus (SINV) also inhibited RNAi in cells. Together, our findings show that SFV uses capsid protein as VSR to antagonize RNAi in infected mammalian cells, and this mechanism is probably used by other alphaviruses, which shed new light on the knowledge of SFV and alphavirus.Importance Alphaviruses are a genus of positive-stranded RNA viruses and include numerous important human pathogens, such as Chikungunya virus, Ross River virus, Western equine encephalitis virus, etc, which create the emerging and re-emerging public health threat worldwide. RNA interference (RNAi) is one of the most important antiviral mechanisms in plants and insects. Accumulating evidence has provided strong support for the existence of antiviral RNAi in mammals. In response to antiviral RNAi, viruses have evolved to encode viral suppressors of RNAi (VSRs) to antagonize the RNAi pathway. It is unclear if alphaviruses encode VSRs that can suppress antiviral RNAi during their infection in mammals. In this study, we first uncovered that capsid protein encoded by Semliki Forest virus (SFV), a prototypic alphavirus, had a potent VSR activity that can antagonize antiviral RNAi in the context of SFV infection in mammalian cells, and this mechanism is probably used by other alphaviruses.","Qian, Qi; Zhou, Hui; Shu, Ting; Mu, Jingfang; Fang, Yuan; Xu, Jiuyue; Li, Tao; Kong, Jing; Qiu, Yang; Zhou, Xi",Journal of virology,213,1

Ultrasound measurements of diaphragm thickness, excursion (EXdi) and thickening fraction (TFdi) are putative estimators of diaphragm function, but have never been compared with phrenic nerve stimulation. Our aim was to describe the relationship between these variables and diaphragm function evaluated using the change in endotracheal pressure after phrenic nerve stimulation (Ptr,stim), and to compare their prognostic value. METHODS Between November 2014 and June 2015, Ptr,stim and ultrasound variables were measured in mechanically ventilated patients <24 hours after intubation ('initiation of mechanical ventilation (MV)', under assist-control ventilation, ACV) and at the time of switch to pressure support ventilation ('switch to PSV'), and compared using Spearman's correlation and receiver operating characteristic curve analysis. Diaphragm dysfunction was defined as Ptr,stim <11 cm H2O. RESULTS 112 patients were included. At initiation of MV, Ptr,stim was not correlated to diaphragm thickness (p=0.28), EXdi (p=0.66) or TFdi (p=0.80). At switch to PSV, TFdi and EXdi were respectively very strongly and moderately correlated to Ptr,stim, (r=0.87, p<0.001 and 0.45, p=0.001), but diaphragm thickness was not (p=0.45). A TFdi <29% could reliably identify diaphragm dysfunction (sensitivity and specificity of 85% and 88%), but diaphragm thickness and EXdi could not. This value was associated with increased duration of ICU stay and MV, and mortality. CONCLUSIONS Under ACV, diaphragm thickness, EXdi and TFdi were uncorrelated to Ptr,stim. Under PSV, TFdi was strongly correlated to diaphragm strength and both were predictors of remaining length of MV and ICU and hospital death.","Dubé, Bruno-Pierre; Dres, Martin; Mayaux, Julien; Demiri, Suela; Similowski, Thomas; Demoule, Alexandre",Thorax,213,31

This study compares conventional laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication (CLNF) to robot-assisted Nissen fundoplication (RANF) using computer-based workflow analysis in an infant pig model. METHODS CLNF and RANF were performed in 12 pigs. Surgical workflow was segmented into phases. Time required to perform specific actions was compared by t test. The quality of knot-tying was evaluated by a skill scoring system. Cardia yield pressure (CYP) was determined to test the efficacy of the fundoplications, and the incidence of complications was compared. RESULTS There was no difference in average times to complete the various phases, despite faster robotic knot-tying (p = 0.001). Suturing quality was superior in CLNF (p = 0.02). CYP increased similarly in both groups. Workflow-interrupting hemorrhage and pneumothorax occurred more frequently during CLNF (p = 0.040 and 0.044, respectively), while more sutures broke during RANF (p = 0.001). CONCLUSION The robot provides no clear temporal advantage compared to conventional laparoscopy for fundoplication, although suturing was faster in RANF. Fewer complications were noted using the robot. RANF and CLNF were equally efficient anti-reflux procedures. For robotic surgery to manifest its full potential, more complex operations may have to be evaluated.","Krauss, Alexandra; Neumuth, Thomas; Wachowiak, Robin; Donaubauer, Bernd; Korb, Werner; Burgert, Oliver; Muensterer, Oliver J",Pediatric surgery international,213,1

Intracranial neural interfaces currently require a craniotomy to achieve implantation and may result in chronic tissue inflammation. Novel approaches are required that achieve less invasive implantation methods while maintaining high spatial resolution. An endovascular stent electrode array avoids direct brain trauma and is able to record electrocorticography in local cortical tissue from within the venous vasculature. The motor area in sheep runs in a parasagittal plane immediately adjacent to the superior sagittal sinus (SSS). The authors aimed to develop a sheep model of cerebral venography that would enable validation of an endovascular neural interface. METHODS Cerebral catheter venography was performed in 39 consecutive sheep. Contrast-enhanced MRI of the brain was performed on 13 animals. Multiple telescoping coaxial catheter systems were assessed to determine the largest wide-bore delivery catheter that could be delivered into the anterior SSS. Measurements of SSS diameter and distance from the motor area were taken. The location of the motor area was determined in relation to lateral and superior projections of digital subtraction venography images and confirmed on MRI. RESULTS The venous pathway from the common jugular vein (7.4 mm) to the anterior SSS (1.2 mm) was technically challenging to selectively catheterize. The SSS coursed immediately adjacent to the motor cortex (< 1 mm) for a length of 40 mm, or the anterior half of the SSS. Attempted access with 5-Fr and 6-Fr delivery catheters was associated with longer procedure times and higher complication rates. A 4-Fr catheter (internal lumen diameter 1.1 mm) was successful in accessing the SSS in 100% of cases with no associated complications. Complications included procedure-related venous dissection in two major areas: the torcular herophili, and the anterior formation of the SSS. The bifurcation of the cruciate sulcal veins with the SSS was a reliable predictor of the commencement of the motor area. CONCLUSIONS The ovine model for cerebral catheter venography has generalizability to the human cerebral venous system in relation to motor cortex location. This novel model may facilitate the development of the novel field of endovascular neural interfaces that may include preclinical investigations for cortical recording applications such as paralysis and epilepsy, as well as other potential applications in neuromodulation.","Oxley, Thomas James; Opie, Nicholas Lachlan; Rind, Gil Simon; Liyanage, Kishan; John, Sam Emmanuel; Ronayne, Stephen; McDonald, Alan James; Dornom, Anthony; Lovell, Timothy John Haynes; Mitchell, Peter John; Bennett, Iwan; Bauquier, Sebastien; Warne, Leon Norris; Steward, Chris; Grayden, David Bruce; Desmond, Patricia; Davis, Stephen M; O'Brien, Terence John; May, Clive N",Journal of neurosurgery,213,16

We compared size-fecundity relationships against traditional allometric scaling with diameter and two models based on crown architecture. All allometric models fail to describe the declining rate of increase in fecundity with diameter found for 80% of 597 species in our analysis.

There was no evidence of clinical signs in infected broiler breeder hens nor in the group of infected pheasants except for one bird in the latter group which exhibited slower movement and gasping. The frequency and intensity of pathomorphological lesions were higher in pheasants. The gross pathology findings were characterized mainly by redness of the mucosa of the upper respiratory tract and accumulation of mucous content in the nasal cavities, infraorbital sinuses, larynx and trachea.

As a result, surgical resection for metastatic ACC is a therapeutic option which can result in long-term survival. There is a paucity of data describing institutional approaches to these challenging patients, and therefore, we herein describe our institution's approach to a patient with a distal pancreatic ACC and isolated liver metastasis. The patient underwent neoadjuvant chemotherapy (FOLFIRINOX), followed by a robot-assisted distal pancreatectomy/splenectomy and non-anatomic segment 6 resection. He was discharged to home post-operative day 2. Final pathology revealed complete tumor response of the liver metastasis and a margin negative resection of the primary tumor.

Sugar-tong splinting has been shown to maintain acceptable reduction in pediatric distal radius fractures while potentially avoiding issues associated with circumferential casting. We hypothesized that the sugar-tong splint would be an acceptable method for initial immobilization to prevent LOR in distal, mid-shaft, and proximal pediatric forearm fractures. METHODS This is an IRB-approved, retrospective study. Inclusion criteria included pediatric patients age 4 to 16 years old, open growth plates, with a displaced forearm fracture (radius, ulna, or both bone) that underwent closed reduction. The clinical protocol involved closed reduction and application of a sugar-tong splint by an orthopaedic resident under conscious sedation in the emergency room. Clinical follow-up occurred at 1, 2, 4, and 6-week intervals with a long-arm cast overwrap applied at the initial clinic visit. Primary outcome was radiographic LOR which was defined as a change of >10 degrees of angulation on anterior posterior/lateral projections from initial postreduction radiograph or previous follow-up radiograph. The secondary outcome was the need for further intervention. RESULTS Sixty-four (38%) patients demonstrated radiographic LOR with 90% of LORs occurring in the first 2 weeks. LOR was significantly more common in distal radius fractures [48/110 (44%)] than with either proximal [2/14 (14%), P=0.04] or mid-shaft radius fractures [7/41 (17%), P=0.004]. There was no difference in LOR by location for ulna fractures [proximal=2/13 (15%), middle=4/38 (11%), distal=20/77 (26%), P>0.08]. There was no difference in radial LOR in patients with isolated radius fractures compared with both bone forearm fracture (17/40 vs. 40/125, P=0.22), or ulnar LOR between isolated ulna and both bone forearm fracture (0/3 vs. 26/125, P>0.99). CONCLUSION The sugar-tong splint is effective at maintaining reduction of pediatric forearm fractures similar to published rates for casting. While effective at all levels of the forearm, the sugar-tong splint performed best in proximal and mid-shaft forearm fractures.

This study aimed to explore the nature of community mental health systems by conducting a participatory community assessment of the assets and needs for mental health in Uttarkashi, a remote district in North India. METHODS The data collection and analysis process were emergent, iterative, dialogic and participatory. Transcripts of 28 in-depth interviews (IDIs) with key informants such as traditional healers, people with lived experience and doctors at the government health centres (CHCs), as well as 10 participatory rural appraisal (PRA) meetings with 120 people in community and public health systems, were thematically analysed. The 753 codes were grouped into 93 categories and ultimately nine themes and three meta-themes (place, people, practices), paying attention to equity. RESULTS Yamuna valley was described as both 'blessed' and limited by geography, with bountiful natural resources enhancing mental health, yet remoteness limiting access to care. The people described strong norms of social support, yet hierarchical with entrenched exclusions related to caste and gender, and social conformity that limited social accountability of services. Care practices were porous, pluralist and fragmented, with operational primary care services that acknowledged traditional care providers, and trusted resources for mental health such as traditional healers (malis) and government health workers (accredited social health activists. ASHAs). Yet care was often absent or limited by being experienced as disrespectful or of low quality. CONCLUSION Findings support the value of participatory methods, and policy actions that address power relations as well as social determinants within community and public health systems. To improve mental health in this remote setting and other South Asian rural locations, community and public health systems must dialogue with the local context, assets and priorities and be socially accountable.","Mathias, Kaaren; Rawat, Meenal; Thompson, Anna; Gaitonde, Rakhal; Jain, Sumeet",International journal of health policy and management,213,16

Although the bases of such changes are not fully understood, ultrastructural alterations in key brain areas are likely contributing factors. Recently we reported that aging-related anxiety in male Wistar rats is associated with ultrastructural changes in the central nucleus of amygdala, an area that plays important role in emotional regulation. In this study we evaluated the cognitive performance of adolescent, adult and aged male Wistar rats in multi-branch maze (MBM) as well as in Morris water maze (MWM). We also performed ultrastructural analysis of the CA1 region of the hippocampus, an area intimately involved in cognitive function. The behavioral data indicate significant impairments in few indices of cognitive functions in both tests in aged rats compared to other two age groups. Concomitantly, total number of presynaptic vesicles as well as total number of vesicles in the resting pool were significantly lower, whereas postsynaptic mitochondrial area was significantly higher in aged rats compared to other age groups. No significant differences in presynaptic terminal area or postsynaptic mitochondrial number were detected between the 3 age groups. These results indicate that selective ultrastructural changes in specific hippocampal region may accompany cognitive decline in aging rats. This article is protected by copyright.

Although bioinformatics analyses suggest that these MTases may also be encoded by other nidoviruses with large genomes, such as toroviruses and roniviruses, no experimental evidence has been reported thus far. In this study, we show that a ronivirus, gill-associated virus (GAV), encodes the 2'-O-MTase activity, although we could not detect 2'-O-MTase activity for the homologous protein of a torovirus, equine torovirus, which is more closely related to coronaviruses. Like the coronavirus 2'-O-MTase, the roniviral 2'-O-MTase harbors a catalytic K-D-K-E tetrad that is conserved among 2'-O-MTases and can target only the N7-methylated cap structure of adenylate-primed RNA substrates. However, in contrast with the coronavirus protein, roniviral 2'-O-MTase does not require a protein cofactor for stimulation of its activity and differs in its preference for several biochemical parameters, such as reaction temperature and pH. Furthermore, the ronivirus 2'-O-MTase can be targeted by MTase inhibitors. These results extend our current understanding of nidovirus RNA cap formation and methylation beyond the coronavirus family. IMPORTANCE Methylation of the 5'-cap structure of viral RNAs plays important roles in genome replication and evasion of innate recognition of viral RNAs by cellular sensors. It is known that coronavirus nsp14 acts as an N7-(guanine)-methyltransferase (MTase) and nsp16 as a 2'-O-MTase, which are involved in the modification of RNA cap structure. However, these enzymatic activities have not been shown for any other nidoviruses beyond coronaviruses in the order Nidovirales In this study, we identified a 2'-O-methyltransferase encoded by ronivirus that shows common and unique features in comparison with that of coronaviruses. Ronivirus 2'-O-MTase does not need a protein cofactor for MTase activity, whereas coronavirus nsp16 needs the stimulating factor nsp10 for its full activity. The conserved K-D-K-E catalytic tetrad is identified in ronivirus 2'-O-MTase. These results extend our understanding of nidovirus RNA capping and methylation beyond coronaviruses and also strengthen the evolutionary and functional links between roniviruses and coronaviruses.","Zeng, Cong; Wu, Andong; Wang, Yi; Xu, Shan; Tang, Yingke; Jin, Xu; Wang, Shilei; Qin, Lei; Sun, Ying; Fan, Chengpeng; Snijder, Eric J; Neuman, Benjamin W; Chen, Yu; Ahola, Tero; Guo, Deyin",Journal of virology,213,1

We analyzed 5 years of results for a multiplex NAAT targeting 14 respiratory viruses to determine how often repeat testing is ordered and the time interval when results are likely to change.Methods: Results for NAAT performed on nasopharyngeal specimens repeated within 90 days of initial testing were analyzed. Logistic regression models were used to compare time intervals between tests on the odds of a change in sample result.Results: During the study period, 21,819 nasopharyngeal specimens were submitted from 16,779 individuals. Of these, 8,807 (40%) samples were positive for at least one viral pathogen. Among this cohort, 2,583 (12%) specimens collected from 1,473 (9%) patients were repeat tests within 90 days of an initial test. If repeated within 90 days, 71% (1833) of tests did not have a change in result. Initially negative tests typically remained negative whereas initial positive tests mostly remained positive until 11- 15 days. Odds of result change plateaued after 20 days. The odds of a change in result for tests repeated within 20 days were only 0.52 times the odds for 21-90 days (95% CI 0.43, 0.62, p<0.001).Conclusions: Multiplex testing for respiratory viruses that are repeated within short periods lead to redundant results at additional costs. Repeat testing of nasopharyngeal specimens before 20 days demonstrates little change. These results provide a vital component for use in laboratory stewardship to curtail unnecessary respiratory viral testing.","Mandelia, Yamini; Procop, Gary W; Richter, Sandra S; Worley, Sarah; Liu, Wei; Esper, Frank",Journal of clinical microbiology,213,27

Stroke survivors use more energy than healthy people during activities such as walking, which has consequences for the way exercise is prescribed for stroke survivors. There is a need for wearable device that can validly measure energy expenditure (EE) of activity to inform exercise prescription early after stroke. We aimed to determine the validity and reliability of the SenseWear-Armband (SWA) to measure EE and step-counts during activity <1 month after stroke. Materials and Methods. EE was measured using the SWA and metabolic cart and steps-counts were measured using the SWA and direct observation. Based on walking ability, participants performed 2x six-minute walks or repeated sit-to-stands. Concurrent validity and test-retest reliability were determined by calculating intraclass and concordance correlation coefficients. Results and Discussion. Thirteen participants walked; nine performed sit-to-stands. Validity of the SWA measuring EE for both activities was poor (ICC/CCC < 0.40). The SWA overestimates EE during walking and underestimated EE during sit-to-stands. Test-retest agreement showed an ICC/CCC of <0.40 and >0.75 for walking and sit-to-stand, respectively. However, agreement levels changed with increasing EE levels (i.e., proportional bias). The SWA did not accurately measure step-counts. Conclusion. The SWA should be used with caution to measure EE of activity of mild to moderate stroke survivors <1 month after stroke.","Kramer, Sharon Flora; Johnson, Liam; Bernhardt, Julie; Cumming, Toby",Stroke research and treatment,213,19

Previous research has found celebrity illness disclosures to influence behavior, but during the uncertainty of a pandemic, the effects of such a disclosure were unclear. OBJECTIVE To test the proposed Celebrity Illness Disclosure Effects (CIDE) model, demonstrating how an illness disclosure, communicated through mediated and interpersonal channels, may shape willingness to engage in prevention behaviors. METHODS We conducted an online survey (N = 587) 24 hours after Hanks' COVID-19 disclosure. RESULTS Findings revealed that celebrity-related perception variables predicted illness-related cognitions and emotions\, which were associated with willingness to enact prevention behaviors. Greater willingness to seek information, stronger perceptions of COVID as a threat, and stronger perceptions of efficacy for dealing with COVID after learning of Hanks' diagnosis predicted stronger willingness to enact prevention behaviors. However, anxiety about COVID predicted lower willingness to enact prevention behaviors. CONCLUSIONS The CIDE model can serve as a guide for future research in this area. The results can help scholars who aim to better understand the phenomena around celebrities and health communication as well as policymakers who hope to ride the wave of star power to improved public health outcomes.","Myrick, Jessica Gall; Willoughby, Jessica Fitts",Social science & medicine,213,16

Thus, the determination of priority wildlife pathogens and risk factors for disease emergence is warranted. We used an online questionnaire survey to assess release and exposure risks, and consequences of wildlife-associated diseases and pathogens in the Republic of Korea (ROK). We also surveyed opinions on pathways for disease exposure, and risk factors for disease emergence and spread. For the assessment of risk, we employed a two-tiered, statistical K-means clustering algorithm to group diseases into three levels (high, medium and low) of perceived risk based on release and exposure risks, societal consequences and the level of uncertainty of the experts' opinions. To examine the experts' perceived risk of routes of introduction of pathogens and disease amplification and spread, we used a Bayesian, multivariate normal order-statistics model. Six diseases or pathogens, including four livestock and two wildlife diseases, were identified as having high risk with low uncertainty. Similarly, 13 diseases were characterized as having high risk with medium uncertainty with three of these attributed to livestock, six associated with human disease, and the remainder having the potential to affect human, livestock and wildlife (i.e., One Health). Lastly, four diseases were described as high risk with high certainty, and were associated solely with fish diseases. Experts identified migration of wildlife, international human movement and illegal importation of wildlife as the three routes posing the greatest risk of pathogen introduction into ROK. Proximity of humans, livestock and wildlife was the most significant risk factor for promoting the spread of wildlife-associated diseases and pathogens, followed by high density of livestock populations, habitat loss and environmental degradation, and climate change. This study provides useful information to decision makers responsible for allocating resources to address disease risks. This approach provided a rapid, cost-effective method of risk assessment of wildlife-associated diseases and pathogens for which the published literature is sparse.","Hwang, J; Lee, K; Walsh, D; Kim, S W; Sleeman, J M; Lee, H",Transboundary and emerging diseases,213,1

Balloon angioplasty has been the conventional endovascular treatment of choice for both native and recurrent coarctation in adults. Recent advancement in stent technology with the development of the covered stents has enhanced the scope for percutaneous management of both native CoAo and post-surgical CoAo. Stent implantation provides better hemodynamic results with larger acute diameter gain and better long-term hemodynamic benefit. Stenting also decreases the incidence of aneurysm formation. The development of biodegradable stents may revolutionize the percutaneous management of coarctation, as the degradation of the stent scaffold within 6 months of implantation will further decrease the incidence of restenosis. In the future stenting may suffice and obviate the need for open repair. Until then, surgical repair of CoAo is the preferred method in both infants and complicated lesions, leaving stenting to adults with focal and uncomplicated disease.","Usman, Mohammed Haris Umer; Rengifo-Moreno, Pablo; Janzer, Sean F; Inglessis-Azuaje, Ignacio; Witzke-Sanz, Christian",Current treatment options in cardiovascular medicine,213,5

If this is correct, simply naming unrelated words and then measuring the semantic distance between them could serve as an objective measure of divergent thinking. To test this hypothesis, we asked 8,914 participants to name 10 words that are as different from each other as possible. A computational algorithm then estimated the average semantic distance between the words; related words (e.g., cat and dog) have shorter distances than unrelated ones (e.g., cat and thimble). We predicted that people producing greater semantic distances would also score higher on traditional creativity measures. In Study 1, we found moderate to strong correlations between semantic distance and two widely used creativity measures (the Alternative Uses Task and the Bridge-the-Associative-Gap Task). In Study 2, with participants from 98 countries, semantic distances varied only slightly by basic demographic variables. There was also a positive correlation between semantic distance and performance on a range of problems known to predict creativity. Overall, semantic distance correlated at least as strongly with established creativity measures as those measures did with each other.

Material and Methods In addition to the literature review, pertinent recommendations are made in respect to the gamma knife radiosurgery (GKRS). Results Every patient presenting to GKRS treatment should be considered as a potential asymptomatic COVID carrier. Patients should be categorized based on the priority (urgent, semi-urgent, or elective) on the basis of pathological and clinical status. The only urgent indication is a non-responding or enlarging cerebral metastasis. There is a high risk of aerosol dispersion during gamma radiation delivery in the gamma gantry. Conclusion These recommendations should be used to minimize the chances of pathogenic exposure to the patient and caregivers both.","Tripathi, Manjul; Deora, Harsh; Sadashiva, Nishanth; Batish, Aman; Mohindra, Sandeep; Gupta, Sunil K",Neurology India,213,12

Reversal of Hartmann's procedure has to be seen as a complex abdominal operation with the same possible complications as in other colorectal resections. By using the laparoscopic technique, operative access trauma by laparotomy can be minimized. After introducing single-port access into laparoscopic surgery beginning with cholecystectomies and sigmoid resections, we started with the first single-port laparoscopic reversal of Hartmann's procedure in January 2010. After excision of the colostoma, mobilization, and reponing into the abdominal cavity, the single-port trocar was placed at the stoma incision without any extra scar. We investigated whether the single-port laparoscopic reversal is as safely feasible as the ""conventional"" laparoscopic procedure. Till December 2010, single-port reversal operation was performed in 8 patients 2-4 months after Hartmann's procedure because of complicated diverticulitis. No conversion to ""conventional"" laparoscopic or open procedure was necessary in 1 patient one extra 5 mm trocar was used. The average operation time was 74 min. Except for one wound complication, the postoperative course was uncomplicated. The patients were discharged after 4 to 8 postoperative days. Single-port reversal of Hartmann's procedure has showed as a new method for minimizing the access trauma even further than ""conventional"" laparoscopic surgery.","Carus, Th; Emmert, A",Minimally invasive surgery,213,1

Monitoring temperature currently requires invasive probes. This work investigates a novel foam-based flexible sensor worn behind the ear for the measurement of core body temperature. This observational study uses the device prototype and clinical data to compare three methods for calculating the temperature from this sensor: a basic heat-flow model, a new dynamic model that addresses changing surrounding temperatures and one that combines the dynamic model with a correction for adhesive quality. Clinical validation was performed with 21 surgical patients (average length of surgery 4.4 h) using an esophageal temperature probe as reference. The operative period was divided into four segments: normal periods (with stable surrounding temperatures), surrounding temperatures increasing due to the use of the Bair Hugger™, stable periods during Bair Hugger™ use and surrounding temperatures decreasing due to its removal. The error bias and limits of agreement over these segments were on average of - 0.05 ± 0.28 °C (95% limits of agreement) overall. The dynamic model outperformed the simple heat-flow model for periods of surrounding temperature changes (12.7% of total time) while it had a similar, high, performance for the temperature-stable periods. The results suggest that our proposed topical sensor can replace invasive core temp sensors and provide a means of consistently measuring core body temperature despite surrounding temperature shifts.","Atallah, Louis; Ciuhu, Calina; Paulussen, Igor; Bongers, Edwin; Blom, Antoon H M; Idrissi, Akram; Noordergraaf, Gerrit",Journal of clinical monitoring and computing,213,11
141498,141498,141498,In the Literature.,12.930318,9.0543375,2020-03-03,"This article discusses the infeasibility of adhering to the Brazil-Milan Criteria for determining whether patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) should be offered liver transplantation. The Criteria are currently used widely in Brazil. However, since they expand the net of the transplant-eligible population, and that transplantation is shown to improve clinical outcomes in HCC patients relative to other treatments, they are inherently attractive and may be adopted by other countries in determining whether HCC patients should receive liver transplantation. I argue that the Criteria unjustifiably disregard the number of tumour nodules found in the patient. This number may be indicative of the recurrence potential of the disease, since these nodules can originate from different clonal populations. The greater the number, the higher the risk these nodules are associated with clones which contain genetic mutations conferring even greater potential for proliferation and dissemination. Clusters of tumour cells may be micro-disseminated to vascular structures surrounding the liver, as well as extrahepatic systems. This increases recurrence potential and reduces the benefit of liver transplantation in these patients. Thus, HCC patients harbouring fewer but larger tumour nodules may present with a more favourable genomic and epigenomic profile than those with more, albeit smaller, tumour nodules. Patients with more tumour nodules may reap greater clinical benefit if initiated on systemic therapy early, rather than wait for a suitable donor liver. Although the Criteria are reached by consensus, with reference to findings from recent studies, as well as scientific theory, it is ripe for review.","Ng, Alexander",Annals of hepatology,213,1

Traditionally, the diagnosis of infectious diseases rely on serologic assays and cultures. Serologic results may be difficult to interpret in the setting of immunosuppression, fresh tissue is not always available for culture, and culture of fastidious pathogens can be difficult and may take weeks or months to yield a result. Although some microorganisms or their cytopathic effects may be readily identifiable on routine and/or histochemical stains, often these changes are not specific or are sparse in the sample evaluated. In these cases, additional immunohistochemical stains are often needed to establish the diagnosis of infection. OBJECTIVE To review the current value and limitations of the use of immunohistochemistry in the diagnosis of infectious diseases in formalin-fixed tissue samples. DATA SOURCES Literature in Medline and the authors' own experience. CONCLUSIONS Immunohistochemistry has proven to be a useful tool in the diagnosis of infectious diseases in tissue samples. Immunohistochemistry is especially useful in the identification of microorganisms that are present in low numbers, stain poorly, are fastidious to grow, are noncultivable, or exhibit an atypical morphology. Finally, it is important to remember that there may be widespread occurrence of common antigens among bacteria and pathogenic fungi and both monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies must be tested for possible cross-reactivity with other organisms.","Eyzaguirre, Eduardo; Haque, Abida K",Archives of pathology & laboratory medicine,213,20

We investigated the interplay between structural and functional networks by means of the differential identifiability framework, which here quantifies the ability of identifying a particular network structure based on (1) the observation of its functional network and (2) the comparison with a prior observation under different initial conditions. We carried out an experiment consisting of the construction of [Formula: see text] different structural networks composed of [Formula: see text] nonlinear electronic circuits and studied the regions where network structures are identifiable. Specifically, we analyzed how differential identifiability is related to the coupling strength between dynamical units (modifying the level of synchronization) and what are the consequences of increasing the amount of noise existing in the functional networks. We observed that differential identifiability reaches its highest value for low to intermediate coupling strengths. Furthermore, it is possible to increase the identifiability parameter by including a principal component analysis in the comparison of functional networks, being especially beneficial for scenarios where noise reaches intermediate levels. Finally, we showed that the regime of the parameter space where differential identifiability is the highest is highly overlapped with the region where structural and functional networks correlate the most.","Vera-Ávila, V P; Sevilla-Escoboza, R; Goñi, J; Rivera-Durón, R R; Buldú, J M",Scientific reports,213,12

Questions have been raised as to the frailty of those succumbing to the COVID-19 infection. In this paper we employ standard life table methods to illustrate how the potential quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) losses associated with COVID-19 fatalities could be estimated, while adjusting for comorbidities in terms of impact on both mortality and quality of life. Contrary to some suggestions in the media, we find that even relatively elderly patients with high levels of comorbidity can still lose substantial life years and QALYs. The simplicity of the method facilitates straightforward international comparisons as the pandemic evolves. In particular, we compare five different countries and show that differences in the average QALY losses for each COVID-19 fatality is driven mainly by differing age distributions for those dying of the disease.","Briggs, Andrew H; Goldstein, Daniel A; Kirwin, Erin; Meacock, Rachel; Pandya, Ankur; Vanness, David J; Wisløff, Torbjørn",Health economics,213,1

Some enzymatic activities are generally associated with RNA viruses such as RNA- or DNA-dependent RNA polymerases, RNA helicases or proteases. Some viral enzyme activities are however unique to some viral families. This is the case of two 3'-5' exoribonuclease activities identified in arenavirus and coronavirus proteomes. Arenaviruses have a segmented ambisense single stranded RNA genome of negative polarity while coronaviruses have a positive single-stranded genomic RNA. Although both enzymes belong to the same exo(ribo)nuclease superfamily, available data indicate that they are involved in very different pathways. Indeed, the exoribonuclease activity carried by the arenavirus nucleoprotein seems to counteract the innate immunity antiviral response while the exoribonuclease activity carried by the coronavirus nsp14 protein is likely involved in a unique RNA repair mechanism. In this review, we present our current knowledge about these two viral enzymes and their functions in the viral life cycle.","Bouvet, Mickaël; Imbert, Isabelle; Ferron, François; Canard, Bruno; Decroly, Etienne",Virologie,213,1

Through clarifying the procedures of collecting sputum specimens, making graphic/video health education materials, standardizing the contents and methods of health education, we conducted education to the subjects. The subject expectorated spontaneously or with medical assistance. For patients, the number of sampling attempts and sputum acquisition times were documented before and after the implementation of the standardized expectoration method; for the returning migrant employees in the enterprises, only the number of collected samples after the implementation of the standardized expectoration method were recorded. RESULTS A total of 378 sputum samples were collected from 227 patients. The sputum sampling rates before and after the implementation of health education were 40.9%and 58.4%, respectively (P<0.01). A total of 304 sputum samples were obtained from 307 enterprise returnees, with a sample collection rate of 99.0%.

The aim of the teaching project is to provide medical students with important dermatological learning goals and contents by using innovative methods. METHODS As part of a teaching project funded by the Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) at the Department of Dermatology, University Hospital Schleswig-Holstein in Kiel, various new, partly media-supported teaching modules were developed in addition to curricular teaching and optimized by regular acceptance evaluations during the development process. RESULTS (1.) Professionally created instructional movies present essential techniques for diagnosis and therapy: standardized dermatological whole-body examination, wound smear sampling, performing of biopsies, curettages and excisions as well as skin suturing techniques on exercise material and on patients. (2.) Tutor-based courses offer students the ability to practice these techniques independently. (3.) Seminar lectures show different clinical pictures in university medicine and doctor's offices as well as the important interaction between clinic and doctor's practice in patient care. (4.) One-day internships in a teaching practice convey the activity in this setting. (5.) Seminars on psychodermatology provide insight into the stress caused by the skin disease using the ""bio-psychosocial disease model"". So far, 282 students have participated in the modules. In 88-100 % of the evaluations, there was a desire for further expansion of the new courses and integration into curricular teaching. CONCLUSIONS Our innovative teaching modules resulted in great acceptance by the students. The freely available instructional films were successfully used by other university locations due to networking in the Academic Teaching Forum. One perspective is the supra-regional and sustainable use of our teaching modules and the transfer of the concept to other departments and faculties.","Wittbecker, Linda Marlen; von Spreckelsen, Regina; Bandholz, Thyra Caroline; Lehmhaus, Friedrich-Wilhelm; Schwarz, Thomas; Gläser, Regine",Journal der Deutschen Dermatologischen Gesellschaft = Journal of the German Society of Dermatology : JDDG,213,31

Patients are often triaged according to image-based early signs of infarction, defined by Alberta Stroke Program Early CT Score (ASPECTS). Our aim was to evaluate interrater reliability in a large group of readers. METHODS We retrospectively analyzed 100 investigators who independently evaluated 20 non-contrast computed tomography (NCCT) scans as part of their qualification program for the TENSION study. Test cases were chosen by four neuroradiologists who had previously scored NCCT scans with ASPECTS between 0 and 8 and high interrater agreement. Percent and interrater agreements were calculated for total ASPECTS, as well as for each ASPECTS region. RESULTS Percent agreements for ASPECTS ratings was 28%, with interrater agreement of 0.13 (95% confidence interval, CI 0.09-0.16), at zero tolerance allowance and 66%, with interrater agreement of 0.32 (95% CI: 0.21-0.44), at tolerance allowance set by TENSION inclusion criteria. ASPECTS region with highest level of agreement was the insular cortex (percent agreement = 96%, interrater agreement = 0.96 (95% CI: 0.94-0.97)) and with lowest level of agreement the M3 region (percent agreement = 68%, interrater agreement = 0.39 [95% CI: 0.17-0.61]). CONCLUSION Interrater agreement reliability for total ASPECTS and study enrollment was relatively low but seems sufficient for practical application. Individual region analysis suggests that some are particularly difficult to evaluate, with varying levels of reliability.

However, anastomotic leakage and stricture are still important clinical problems after esophagogastric anastomosis, causing burdensome symptoms and poor quality of life. Herein, we describe a novel cervical end-to-side triangulating esophagogastric anastomoasis using linear stapler. METHODS A total of 90 patients (85 % male; mean age 63 years) with thoracic esophageal cancer who underwent cervical end-to-side esophagogastric triangular anastomosis using a linear stapler after minimally invasive esophagectomy between November 2006 and April 2013 were retrospectively reviewed. RESULTS The median operation time was 602 min (range 424-936 min). The volume of blood loss during the entire operative procedure was 127 ml (range 0-700 ml). There were no cases of anastomotic leakage in this study, although four patients (4.4 %) developed dysphagia associated with benign anastomotic stricture formation. All patients with a benign anastomotic stricture underwent balloon dilation, which resulted in improvement in their symptoms.

METHODS From June 2002 to May 2013, 26 patients (18 men; mean age 71.2 years, 53-86) underwent thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR) combined with chimney technique. Indications for treatment were: a proximal landing zone <15 mm long distal to the left subclavian artery (LSA), thoracic aortic aneurysm (n=13), complicated type B aortic dissection (n=10), type I endoleak after previous TEVAR (n=2), and penetrating aortic ulcer (n=1). Treatment was performed in the emergency setting in 7 cases. The 28 chimney stent-grafts (double chimneys in 2 patients) were deployed in the innominate artery (n=7), left common carotid artery (n=10), and LSA (n=11). All patients underwent computed tomography before discharge, at 1, 6, and 12 months, and yearly thereafter. RESULTS Technical success was 100%. One (3.8%) perioperative death was due to a cerebral hemorrhage. No major stroke was registered, but 3 (11.5%) minor strokes occurred (all resolved). Paraparesis developed in 2 (7.7%) patients. Median follow-up was 36.8 months (range 1-131), during which an additional 4 (15.4%) patients died, but only 1 death was aneurysm-related. Chimney graft patency was 89.3% (25/28); an asymptomatic fracture was found in a patent chimney stent-graft at the 18-month follow-up. The type I endoleak rate was 23% (n=6); 3 endoleaks associated with aneurysm sac enlargement were treated. CONCLUSION The chimney technique for aortic arch pathologies is safe and feasible and may be an option in patients considered at high risk for surgery or who are ineligible for conventional TEVAR, especially in the emergency setting. Concern persists regarding type I endoleak, and long-term follow-up remains mandatory.","Mangialardi, Nicola; Serrao, Eugenia; Kasemi, Holta; Alberti, Vittorio; Fazzini, Stefano; Ronchey, Sonia",Journal of endovascular therapy : an official journal of the International Society of Endovascular Specialists,213,12

METHODS A retrospective cohort analysis using routinely collected records from 70,431 adults aged 18+ in South England within the Electronic Care and Health Information Analytics (CHIA) database. Total volume and type of consultations (face-to-face, home visits, telephone, email/video, or out of hours) for respiratory tract symptoms between 1 January and 31 July 2020 (during the first wave of the pandemic) were compared with the equivalent period in 2019 for the same cohort. Descriptive statistics were used to summarize consultations by sociodemographic and clinical characteristics, and by COVID-19 diagnosis and outcomes (death, hospitalization, and pneumonia). RESULTS Overall consultations for respiratory tract symptoms increased by 229% during the pandemic compared with the preceding year. This included significant increases in telephone consultations by 250%, a 1,574% increase in video/email consultations, 105% increase in home visits, and 92% increase in face-to-face consultations. Nearly 60% of people who presented with respiratory symptoms were tested for COVID-19 and 16% confirmed or clinically suspected to have the virus. Those with complications including pneumonia, requiring hospitalization, and who died were more likely to be seen in-person. CONCLUSION During the pandemic, primary care substantially increased consultations for respiratory tract symptoms to identify and manage people with COVID-19. These findings should be balanced against national reports of reduced GP workload for non-COVID care.","Dambha-Miller, Hajira; Hounkpatin, Hilda O; Morgan-Harrisskitt, Jeffrey; Stuart, Beth; Fraser, Simon D S; Roderick, Paul",Family practice,213,27

In this case study, we present an 8-year-old girl presenting with HSP-induced myocarditis and thrombus in the right atrium and HSP nephritis. To date, 15 cases of HSP-related cardiac involvement have been reported in the PubMed/MEDLINE, Scopus, and Google Scholar databases. These cases, together with our case, are included in this review. We excluded those patients with other rheumatologic diseases (acute rheumatic fever, acute post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis, Kawasaki disease) accompanied by HSP. Three were children and 13 were adults and all were male except our case. This review revealed tachyarrhythmia, chest pain, dyspnea, murmur, and heart failure as the major signs. Cardiac tests, electrocardiogram (ECG), and imaging methods (echocardiography in all patients, cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in three, cardiac biopsy in one, and post-mortem necropsy in three) showed that the cardiac involvements were pericardial effusion, intra-atrial thrombus, myocarditis, coronary artery changes, myocardial ischemia, infarction and necrosis, subendocardial hemorrhage, and left ventricular dilatation. Kidney involvement was not observed in three patients. As the treatment, high-dose prednisolone and cyclophosphamide, oral corticosteroid, azathioprine, nadroparin calcium, ACE inhibitors, calcium antagonists, beta-blockers, and diuretics were used. Eleven patients (all three children and eight of the adults) had a complete cardiac recovery. Cardiac involvement in adults was more likely to be fatal. Death (three patients), ischemia, and infarct have been reported only in adults. We suggested that early and aggressive treatment can be life-saving. MRI examination is effective at identifying cardiac involvement.","Yılmaz, Neslihan; Yüksel, Selçuk; Becerir, Tülay; Girişgen, İlknur; Ufuk, Furkan; Gürses, Dolunay; Yılmaz, Münevver; Yalçın, Nagihan",Clinical rheumatology,213,20

A total of 360 1-day-old male broilers were randomly divided into three groups containing six replicates with 20 broilers per replicate. The negative control (NC) group and the positive control (PC) group were given non-GM maize and non-GM maize plus exogenous vitamin E (VE), respectively, and the VER group was given VER replacing the non-GM maize given to the NC group. Between days 1 and 21 and days 22 and 42, VE levels were 4.38 and 4.63 mg kg-1 in the NC group, and 14.11 and 14.91 mg kg-1 in the PC and VER group, respectively. RESULTS The results showed that α-tocopherol from both VER and additives increased α-tocopherol transfer protein and cytochrome P450 concentrations. Additionally, serum α-tocopherol and α-tocopherylquinone levels of broilers in the PC and VER groups were significantly higher than those in the NC group (P < 0.05). Compared with the NC group, broilers in both groups that received α-tocopherol had reduced NF-κB p65 concentrations, significantly decreased serum prostaglandin E2 , IL-6, malondialdehyde, and hydrogen peroxide levels (P < 0.05), and significantly increased glutathione, glutathione peroxidase, and total antioxidant capacity (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION In summary, both VER and non-GM maize fortified with exogenous VE showed similar effects on broilers, indicating that the α-tocopherol in VER has sufficient biological activity.

However, the two most common agents for coaptation, sutures and fibrin glues, have drawbacks such as inflammation, pathogenesis, and dehiscence. Chitosan-based adhesives are a promising alternative, reported to have good cytocompatibility and favorable immunogenicity. A photo-cross-linkable hydrogel based on chitosan is proposed as a new adhesive for peripheral nerve anastomosis. Two Az-chitosans were synthesized by conjugating 4-azidobenzoic acid with low (LMW, 15 kDa) and high (HMW, 50-190 kDa) molecular weight chitosans. These solutions formed a hydrogel in less than 1 min under UV light. The LMW Az-chitosan was more tightly cross-linked than the HMW variant, undergoing significantly less swelling and possessing a higher rheological storage modulus, and both Az-chitosan gels were stiffer than commercial fibrin glue. Severed nerves repaired by Az-chitosan adhesives tolerated longitudinal forces comparable or superior to fibrin glue. Adhesive exposure to intact nerves and neural cell culture showed both Az-chitosans to be nontoxic in the acute (minutes) and chronic (days) time frames. These results demonstrate that Az-chitosan hydrogels are cytocompatible and mechanically suitable for use as bioadhesives in peripheral neurosurgeries.","Rickett, Todd A; Amoozgar, Zohreh; Tuchek, Chad A; Park, Joonyoung; Yeo, Yoon; Shi, Riyi",Biomacromolecules,213,24

Dressings form a key part of ulcer treatment, with clinicians and patients having many different types to choose from. A clear and current overview of current evidence is required to facilitate decision-making regarding dressing use. OBJECTIVES The review aimed to evaluate the effects of foam wound dressings on the healing of foot ulcers in people with diabetes. SEARCH STRATEGY We searched the Cochrane Wounds Group Specialised Register (searched 10 June 2011); The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2011, Issue 2); Ovid MEDLINE (1950 to June Week 1 2011); Ovid MEDLINE (In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations, 8 June, 2011); Ovid EMBASE (1980 to 2011 Week 22); EBSCO CINAHL (1982 to 3 June 2011). There were no restrictions based on language or date of publication. SELECTION CRITERIA Published or unpublished randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that evaluated the effects on ulcer healing of one or more foam wound dressings in the treatment of foot ulcers in people with diabetes. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS Two review authors independently performed study selection, risk of bias assessment and data extraction. MAIN RESULTS We included six studies (157 participants) in this review. Meta analysis of two studies indicated that foam dressings do not promote the healing of diabetic foot ulcers compared with basic wound contact dressings (RR 2.03, 95%CI 0.91 to 4.55). Pooled data from two studies comparing foam and alginate dressing found no statistically significant difference in ulcer healing (RR 1.50, 95% CI 0.92 to 2.44). There was no statistically significant difference in the number of diabetic foot ulcers healed when foam dressings were compared with hydrocolloid (matrix) dressings. All included studies were small and/or had limited follow-up times. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS Currently there is no research evidence to suggest that foam wound dressings are more effective in healing foot ulcers in people with diabetes than other types of dressing however all trials in this field are very small. Decision makers may wish to consider aspects such as dressing cost and the wound management properties offered by each dressing type e.g. exudate management.","Dumville, Jo C; Deshpande, Sohan; O'Meara, Susan; Speak, Katharine",The Cochrane database of systematic reviews,213,24

Another human parvovirus, B19, can lead to fetal hydrops, miscarriage and intrauterine fetal death (IUFD). OBJECTIVES To determine the prevalence of HBoV DNA in aborted fetuses and IUFDs. The HBoV serology of the mothers was also studied. STUDY DESIGN We retrospectively studied all available fetuses (N=535) autopsied during 7/1992-12/1995, and 1/2003-12/2005 in Helsinki, Finland. All available formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded fetal tissues - placenta, heart and liver - of 120 miscarriages, 169 IUFDs, and 246 induced abortions were studied by quantitative PCR. We also measured the HBoV IgM and IgG antibodies in the corresponding maternal sera (N=462) mostly of the first trimester. The IgM-positive sera underwent HBoV PCR. RESULTS None of the fetal tissues harbored HBoV DNA. A total of 97% (448/462) of the mothers were positive for IgG antibodies to HBoV, while only 0.9% (4/462) exhibited HBoV-specific IgM antibodies without viremia or respiratory symptoms. One IgM-positive mother had an unexplained fetal loss. CONCLUSIONS We did not find HBoV DNA in any of the deceased fetuses. Almost all pregnant women were HBoV-IgG positive.","Riipinen, Anita; Väisänen, Elina; Lahtinen, Anne; Karikoski, Riitta; Nuutila, Mika; Surcel, Heljä-Marja; Taskinen, Helena; Hedman, Klaus; Söderlund-Venermo, Maria",Journal of clinical virology : the official publication of the Pan American Society for Clinical Virology,213,1

As dementia progresses and care needs escalate, the likelihood of institutionalization is increased, which is counter to the wishes of the majority of older adults and their family members. Dementia care apps can provide critical support and have the potential to improve the QOL of both PLwD and their family caregivers and reduce perceived caregivers' burden. However, there is a lack of understanding of the needs of both PLwD and their family caregivers related to dementia care apps. There is also a gap in understanding the privacy concerns in relation to the apps among older adults with dementia and their caregivers. As such, the main aims of this systematic review are to understand the landscape of dementia mobile apps targeting PLwD and their caregivers with respect to the features of the apps, usability testing, and the privacy and security aspects of the app from the perspective of both app developers/researchers and the end users (PLwD and family caregivers who provide care of PLwD).

In recent years, there has been a vast increase in researchers using laser scanning IVCM to image and quantify corneal nerve parameters. However, a range of methodological approaches have been adopted. The primary aim of this systematic review is to critically appraise the reported method(s) of primary research studies that have used laser scanning IVCM to quantify corneal sub-basal nerve plexus (SBNP) parameters in humans, and to examine corneal nerve parameters in healthy individuals. METHODS AND ANALYSIS A systematic review of primary studies that have used laser scanning IVCM to quantify SBNP parameters in humans will be conducted. Comprehensive electronic searches will be performed in Ovid MedLine, Embase and the Cochrane Library. Two reviewers will independently assess titles and abstracts, and exclude studies not meeting the inclusion criteria. For studies judged eligible or potentially eligible, full texts will be independently assessed by two reviewers to determine eligibility. A third reviewer will resolve any discrepancies in judgement. Risk of bias will be assessed using a custom tool, covering five methodological domains: participant selection, method of image capture, method of image analysis, data reporting and other sources of bias. A systematic narrative synthesis of findings will be provided. A multilevel random-effects meta-analysis will be performed for corneal nerve parameters derived from healthy participants. This review will be reported according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses statement. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION As this review considers published data, ethical approval is not required. We foresee that this synthesis will serve as a reference for future studies, and can be used to inform best practice standards for using IVCM in clinical research. A manuscript reporting the results of the review will be published and may also be presented at scientific conferences.","De Silva, Manikkuwadura Eranda Harshan; Zhang, Alexis Ceecee; Karahalios, Amalia; Chinnery, Holly Rose; Downie, Laura Elizabeth",BMJ open,213,1

The syndrome accompanying predominant right anterior temporal atrophy has previously been described as memory loss, prosopagnosia, getting lost and behavioural changes. Accurate detection is challenging, as the clinical syndrome might be confused with either behavioural variant FTD (bvFTD) or Alzheimer's disease. Furthermore, based on neuroimaging features, the syndrome has been considered a right-sided variant of semantic variant primary progressive aphasia (svPPA). Therefore, we aimed to demarcate the clinical and neuropsychological characteristics of rtvFTD versus svPPA, bvFTD and Alzheimer's disease. Moreover, we aimed to compare its neuroimaging profile against svPPA, which is associated with predominant left anterior temporal atrophy. Of 619 subjects with a clinical diagnosis of frontotemporal dementia or primary progressive aphasia, we included 70 subjects with a negative amyloid status in whom predominant right temporal lobar atrophy was identified based on blinded visual assessment of their initial brain MRI scans. Clinical symptoms were assessed retrospectively and compared with age- and sex-matched patients with svPPA (n = 70), bvFTD (n = 70) and Alzheimer's disease (n = 70). Prosopagnosia, episodic memory impairment and behavioural changes such as disinhibition, apathy, compulsiveness and loss of empathy were the most common initial symptoms, whereas during the disease course, patients developed language problems such as word-finding difficulties and anomia. Distinctive symptoms of rtvFTD compared to the other groups included depression, somatic complaints, and motor/mental slowness. Aside from right temporal atrophy, the imaging pattern showed volume loss of the right ventral frontal area and the left temporal lobe, which represented a close mirror image of svPPA. Atrophy of the bilateral temporal poles and the fusiform gyrus were associated with prosopagnosia in rtvFTD. Our results highlight that rtvFTD has a unique clinical presentation. Since current diagnostic criteria do not cover specific symptoms of the rtvFTD, we propose a diagnostic tree to be used to define diagnostic criteria and call for an international validation.","Ulugut Erkoyun, Hulya; Groot, Colin; Heilbron, Ronja; Nelissen, Anne; van Rossum, Jonathan; Jutten, Roos; Koene, Ted; van der Flier, Wiesje M; Wattjes, Mike P; Scheltens, Philip; Ossenkoppele, Rik; Barkhof, Frederik; Pijnenburg, Yolande",Brain : a journal of neurology,213,1

However, the trend for older adults is less clear. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS To examine NLEA trends among older adults with diabetes (≥67 years), we used 100% Medicare claims for beneficiaries enrolled in Parts A and B, also known as fee for service (FFS). NLEA was defined as the highest-level amputation per patient per calendar year. Annual NLEA rates were estimated from 2000 to 2017 and stratified by age-group, sex, race/ethnicity, NLEA level (toe, foot, below-the-knee amputation [BKA], above-the-knee amputation [AKA]), and state. All rates were age and sex standardized to the 2000 Medicare population. Trends over time were assessed using Joinpoint regression and annual percent change (APC) reported. RESULTS NLEA rates (per 1,000 people with diabetes) decreased by half from 8.5 in 2000 to 4.4 in 2009 (APC -7.9, P < 0.001). However, from 2009 onward, NLEA rates increased to 4.8 (APC 1.2, P < 0.01). Trends were similar across most age, sex, and race/ethnic groups, but absolute rates were highest in the oldest age-groups, blacks, and men. By NLEA type, overall increases were driven by increases in rates of toe and foot NLEAs, while BKA and AKA continued to decline. The majority of U.S. states showed recent increases in NLEA, similar to national estimates. CONCLUSIONS This study of the U.S. Medicare FFS population shows that recent increases in diabetes-related NLEAs are also occurring in older populations but at a less severe rate than among younger adults (<65 years) in the general population. Preventive foot care has been shown to reduce rates of NLEA among adults with diabetes, and the findings of the study suggest that those with diabetes-across the age spectrum-could benefit from increased attention to this strategy.","Harding, Jessica L; Andes, Linda J; Rolka, Deborah B; Imperatore, Giuseppina; Gregg, Edward W; Li, Yanfeng; Albright, Ann",Diabetes care,213,1

Symptomatic disease requires a posterior fossa decompression with or without an expansile duraplasty. To date, the optimal surgical treatment for CM1 has not been delineated. The extent of bony removal, size of the dural opening, necessity for expansion of the dural space, choice of materials for the duraplasty, and possible need for augmentation with dural sealant are all factors that continue to be debated amongst neurological surgeons worldwide. We herein evaluate the use of fibrin sealant augmentation in combination with locally harvested autologous pericranium for duraplasty in adult CM1 decompression. METHODS Retrospective data collected from January 2006 to December 2011. Data were reviewed for surgical site infection or meningitis, cerebrospinal fluid leak, symptomatic pseudomeningocele, radiographic improvement of hindbrain compression, and postoperative recurrence of symptoms at a minimum of 1 year of follow-up. Outcomes were studied clinically, radiographically, as well as by using a patient-specific questionnaire. RESULTS Twenty-two consecutive patients were included. One patient required a revision for a delayed graft dehiscence in the setting of a rare form of aseptic meningitis with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pleocytosis due to a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) allergy. All remaining patients had successful decompressions with full resolution of their symptoms except for one patient who had persistent headaches. CONCLUSION Autologous pericranium with dural sealant augmentation is an effective technique for expansile duraplasty in CM1 decompressions.","Lam, Fred C; Penumaka, Anirudh; Chen, Clark C; Fischer, Edwin G; Kasper, Ekkehard M",Surgical neurology international,213,30

The main emphasis has been on achieving high spot to spot, sample to sample reproducibility of the SERS signals while maintaining useful enhancement factors. The use of these surfaces, metalized with either Ag or Au, provides a noninvasive and nondestructive method for spectral fingerprint analyses of both bacteria and viruses. Examples are given for the detection of bacteria (E. coli and B. cereus) and viruses (respiratory syncytial virus and Coxsackievirus). Our method is able to distinguish Gram positive from Gram negative bacterial strains as well as enveloped and nonenveloped viruses. The results demonstrate the development of a new class of SERS substrates which can provide rapid, selective identification of infectious agents without amplification of cultures.","Demirel, M C; Kao, P; Malvadkar, N; Wang, H; Gong, X; Poss, M; Allara, D L",Biointerphases,213,1

In this video we present how a large gap of approximately 8 cm is bridged by applying several techniques that are not part of our standardized surgical procedure. CASE PRESENTATION After creation of a 20 mL gastric pouch we discovered that the alimentary limb could not be advanced further cranially due to a very short a thick jejunal mesentery in a 49 year old male patient during laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (LRYGB) surgery. By dissecting the gastro-oesophageal junction form the crus, stretching the gastric pouch, transecting the jejunal mesentery, using a retrocolic/retrogastric route, and creating a fully hand-sewn gastrojejunostomy we were able to safely complete the LRYGB. Drains were left near the gastrojejunostomy and the patient was kept nil by mouth for 5 days. On the 5th postoperative day radiographic swallow series were obtained which revealed no sign of leakage. The patient was discharged in good clinical condition on the 6th postoperative day. To date, no complications have occurred. Weight loss results are -31.5 % of the preoperative total body weight. CONCLUSIONS When confronted with a large distance between the gastric pouch and the alimentary limb, several techniques presented in this video may be of aid to the bariatric surgeon. We stress that only experienced bariatric surgeon should embark on these techniques. Inspecting the alimentary limb before the creation of the gastric pouch may prevent the need for such complex techniques.","Geubbels, Noëlle; Kappers, Ingrid; van de Laar, Arnold W J M",BMC surgery,213,26

There are little published data regarding the combined application of these techniques to the resection of low rectal tumours. The aim of this study was to assess the feasibility of such an approach and to appraise short-term outcomes in a consecutive series of patients undergoing laparoscopic extralevator abdominoperineal excision (ELAPE). METHODS Consecutive patients undergoing laparoscopic ELAPE at our institution between 2008 and 2011 were identified from a prospectively maintained database. The abdominal phase of the operation was performed laparoscopically, and following extralevator resection, the perineum was reconstructed using a biologic mesh. All patients were enrolled in an enhanced recovery programme. RESULTS Of 166 patients undergoing radical resection of rectal cancer at our institution between 2008 and 2011, 28 underwent laparoscopic ELAPE. Median age was 70 years, median body mass index was 27.5 kg/m(2), and 71% were male. The conversion rate to laparotomy was 18%. Three patients (10.8%) had circumferential resection margins <1 mm; no intraoperative tumour perforation occurred. The median length of stay was 7 days, with a 30-day readmission rate of 21% and no 30-day mortality. Post-operative perineal wound complications occurred in 25%. At median 38-month follow-up (range 23-66 months), overall survival was 75%, disease-free survival was 71%, and there were three local recurrences (11%). CONCLUSIONS Laparoscopic extralevator abdominoperineal excision can be safely performed without compromising short-term outcomes.","Kipling, S L; Young, K; Foster, J D; Smart, N J; Hunter, A E; Cooper, E; Francis, N K",Techniques in coloproctology,213,31

Coronavirus, the causative organism, binds with angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors in the lungs and produces pneumonia-like symptoms. ACE2 is highly expressed in the lungs produces pneumonia-like symptoms. Other than lungs, ACE2 receptors are also seen in the endothelium of blood vessels. Therefore, viruses can bind to the ACE2 endothelium of brain blood vessels and thus can invade BBB leading to neuronal damage. It is also believed that olfactory cells rich in ACE2 receptors may act as the main route of viral spread into various parts of the brain. The reported neurological effects of SARS-CoV-2 include cerebrovascular diseases, ageusia and anosmia, Guillain Barre Syndrome, and viral encephalitis. The extent of neurological involvement in SARS-CoV-2 infection warrants the necessity of further research to systematically classify neurological complications associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection, its diagnosis, and treatment. As ACE2 receptors are present in various other organs, it is obligatory to study the effect of coronavirus on other organs. Since the long-lasting effects of the COVID-19 are unclear, more studies should be conducted to confirm the effect of the virus on the central nervous system. This review highlights the reported neurological manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 and its mechanism.","Anu K R,; Das, Subham; Joseph, Alex",Current neuropharmacology,213,1

The objectives of this study were to assess preoperative expectations in women undergoing mastectomy and initial breast reconstruction, provide expectations-based education, and evaluate satisfaction with education. Fifty-one women undergoing mastectomy and breast tissue expander placement participated in this study. At a preoperative education appointment, participants completed a questionnaire to determine whether their expectations were realistic, unrealistic, or unformed. A nurse practitioner reviewed the results and provided patient-centered, expectations-based education to modify expectations from unrealistic to realistic or to set expectations from unformed to realistic. Four to 6 weeks after surgery, a second questionnaire was provided to assess perceived satisfaction with education. Unrealistic and unformed expectations were identified related to complications, pain, scarring, sensation, symmetry, and aesthetic results. After receiving patient-centered, expectations-based preoperative education, participants agreed they had received the appropriate amount of information and felt well prepared for their surgery and recovery. Most participants reported they were aware of possible complications, had effective tools to manage their pain, and had received adequate information about scarring and sensation changes. Some participants continued to have unrealistic or unformed expectations related to aesthetic results. Women undergoing breast reconstruction often have unrealistic or unformed expectations before surgery.

However, due to the limitations of the first generation of intestinal organoids, basal-out structure and growth in Matrigel, most pathogens can rarely attach to the apical membrane directly and hardly initiate infection. In this study, we first developed a next-generation porcine intestinal organoid culture system, characterized by an apical membrane on the surface, called apical-out. To investigate the infectivity and antiviral immune responses of this apical-out porcine intestinal organoid, a swine enteric virus, transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), was employed to inoculate the culture system. Both RT-qPCR and IFA analysis demonstrated that TGEV replicated in the apical-out porcine intestinal organoid culture system. Additionally, our results illustrated that TGEV infection significantly upregulated the expression levels of IFN-α, IFN-λ1, ISG15, ISG58, TNF-α, and IL-6 in this culture system. Hence, we successfully developed a porcine intestinal apical-out organoid culture system, which will facilitate the investigation of pathogen-host interactions in pig intestines.IMPORTANCE Intestinal organoids are a newly developed culture system for investigating pathogen-host interactions. Intestinal organoid models have been widely used since their development because the results obtained from this type of culture model better represent physiological conditions than those from well-established cell lines. The 3D porcine intestinal organoid model was reported in 2018 and 2019 for the investigation of intestinal pathogens. However, those organoid culture models were basal-out intestinal organoids, which are not suitable for porcine enteric virus research because they invade the intestines via the apical side of epithelial cells on villi. In this study, we developed a porcine apical-out intestinal organoid culture system and verified its infectivity, type I, and type III IFN antiviral responses, and inflammatory responses following infection by a swine enteric virus. Our results imply that this apical-out porcine intestinal organoid culture system is an ideal model for the investigation of interactions between swine enteric viruses and the intestines.","Li, Yang; Yang, Ning; Chen, Jianing; Huang, Xin; Zhang, Na; Yang, Shanshan; Liu, Guo; Liu, Guangliang",Journal of virology,213,1

This systematic review aimed to synthesise the literature on mechanisms of delivery for a range of infectious disease-related interventions provided to conflict-affected women, children and adolescents. METHODS We searched Medline, Embase, CINAHL and PsychINFO databases for literature published in English from January 1990 to March 2018. Eligible publications reported on conflict-affected neonates, children, adolescents or women in LMICs who received an infectious disease intervention. We extracted and synthesised information on delivery characteristics, including delivery site and personnel involved, as well as barriers and facilitators, and we tabulated reported intervention coverage and effectiveness data. RESULTS A majority of the 194 eligible publications reported on intervention delivery in sub-Saharan Africa. Vaccines for measles and polio were the most commonly reported interventions, followed by malaria treatment. Over two-thirds of reported interventions were delivered in camp settings for displaced families. The use of clinics as a delivery site was reported across all intervention types, but outreach and community-based delivery were also reported for many interventions. Key barriers to service delivery included restricted access to target populations; conversely, adopting social mobilisation strategies and collaborating with community figures were reported as facilitating intervention delivery. Few publications reported on intervention coverage, mostly reporting variable coverage for vaccines, and fewer reported on intervention effectiveness, mostly for malaria treatment regimens. CONCLUSIONS Despite an increased focus on health outcomes in humanitarian crises, our review highlights important gaps in the literature on intervention delivery among specific subpopulations and geographies. This indicates a need for more rigorous research and reporting on effective strategies for delivering infectious disease interventions in different conflict contexts.

The genome of NiV consists of six genes (N, P, M, F, G and L) encoding yielding nucleoprotein, phosphoprotein, matrix, fusion, glycoprotein and large RNA polymerase. We have used these six genes for in silico assessment of DNA codon optimization in Escherichia coli. It was observed that the codon adaptation index (CAI) and GC content of the genes in optimized DNA were enhanced significantly as compared to wild-type strain. On an average, CAI and GC content of N gene in optimized DNA was enhanced by 2.3 (135.1%) and 1.2(9.9 %) fold respectively, while in P/V/C it was increased by 2.0 (98.3 %) and 1.1(7.8%) fold respectively.

Despite the ubiquity with which parents and their children watch screen media together, no study has investigated intersubject synchronisation in father-child dyads during such a co-viewing activity. The present study examined whether father-child dyads would exhibit unique inter-subject synchronisation during co-viewing of narrative visual scenes that is unique to the dyad and hence would not be observed in control dyads (i.e. randomly paired signals). Hyperscanning fNIRS was used to record the prefrontal cortex (PFC) signals of 29 fathers and their preschool-aged children (11 girls, 18 boys) as each pair engaged in a typical activity of watching children’s shows together. Three 1-min video clips from “Brave”, “Peppa Pig” and “The Incredibles” were presented to each dyad and children’s ratings of video positivity and familiarity were obtained afterwards. PFC activity was analysed according to four clusters: medial left, medial right, frontal left and frontal right clusters. Results from synchrony analyses demonstrated that true father-child dyads showed significantly greater inter-subject synchronisation than control dyads, especially in the medial left cluster during the emotionally arousing conflict scene. Dyads with older fathers displayed less synchrony and older fathers, compared to younger ones, were also found to exhibit greater activity in the frontal right cluster. These findings point to a unique inter-subject synchronisation that exists in father-child relationships during shared co-viewing of narrative scenes which could be potentially modulated by parental age.","Azhari, Atiqah; Bizzego, Andrea; Esposito, Gianluca",bioRxiv,213,20

Preprint platforms were either owned by non-profit academic groups, scientific societies or funding organisations (n=28; 64%), owned/partly owned by for-profit publishers or companies (n=14; 32%) or owned by individuals/small communities (n=2; 5%). Twenty-four (55%) preprint platforms accepted content from all scientific fields although some of these had restrictions relating to funding source, geographical region or an affiliated journal’s remit. Thirty-three (75%) preprint platforms provided details about article screening (basic checks) and 14 (32%) of these actively involved researchers with context expertise in the screening process. The three most common screening checks related to the scope of the article, plagiarism and legal/ethical/societal issues and compliance. Almost all preprint platforms allow submission to any peer-reviewed journal following publication, have a preservation plan for read-access, and most have a policy regarding reasons for retraction and the sustainability of the service. Forty-one (93%) platforms currently have usage metrics, with the most common metric being the number of downloads presented on the abstract page. Conclusion A large number of preprint platforms exist for use in biomedical and medical sciences, all of which offer researchers an opportunity to rapidly disseminate their research findings onto an open-access public server, subject to scope and eligibility. However, the process by which content is screened before online posting and withdrawn or removed after posting varies between platforms, which may be associated with platform operation, ownership, governance and financing. What is already known on this topic In concurrence with an increase in the number of preprint servers and platforms supporting biomedical and medical sciences research since 2013, there has been substantial growth in the number of preprints posted in this research area. The significant benefits of accelerated dissemination of research that preprints offer has attracted the support of many major funders. The raised profile of preprints has led to their wider acceptance in institutional and individual level assessment. What this study adds This is the first full examination of the characteristics and policies of 44 preprint platforms with biomedical and medical scope. We use a robust methodological approach to extract relevant information from web-based material with input from preprint platform owners. Despite concerns regarding the permanence and quality of preprints, most preprint platforms have long-term preservation strategies and many have screening checks (for example, a basic check for the relevance of content) in place. For some platforms, these checks are performed by researchers with content expertise. We provide a searchable database as a valuable resource for researchers, funders and policymakers in the biomedical and medical science field to determine which preprint platforms are relevant to their research scope and which have the functionality and policies that they value most.","Kirkham, Jamie J; Penfold, Naomi; Murphy, Fiona; Boutron, Isabelle; Ioannidis, John PA; Polka, Jessica K; Moher, David",bioRxiv,213,17

Materials and methods: We conducted a retrospective evaluation for characteristics and outcomes in critical care set up across six months. Results: 514 patients (74.3% males and 25.6% females) were evaluated. 9.72% (n = 50) patients expired, 78% (n = 39) were males. Mean age (years) was 57 (±14, range 64, 95% CI 55–58). 65.7% (n = 338) were of age more than 50 years, of which 71.5% (n = 242) were males. Males at 20% higher risk for death than women. (RR = 1.2, 95% CI 0.66–2.31, p = 0.61 NS). There was 18% less risk of mortality in female vs male with comorbidities (RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.67–1.12, p = 0.32 NS). Risk for mortality in diabetics was significantly increased by 116% vs nondiabetics. (RR 2.16, p = 0.0055, 95% CI 1.28–3.67). Highly significant risk of mortality in age group >50 years (3.13 times higher) vs age ≤50 years. (RR 3.1895% CI 1.71–8.64, p = 0.0003). 50.2% had moderate ARDS at admission. High flow nasal cannula was used in 47.2%. There is 5.79 times more likelihood to be on the ventilator with moderate to severe ARDS vs mild ARDS (RR = 5.79, 95% CI 3.10–11.05, p <0.0001). Risk for death was six times higher for patients on ventilator vs not on ventilator (RR = 6.08, 95% CI 3.49–10.59, p <0.0001). The mean number of days on ventilator for patients who underwent tracheostomy (n = 49) was 14 days as compared to 6.6 days in patients who were extubated (n = 57) (p <0.0001)P/F ratio had negative correlation with number of days of hospitalisation (Pearson r-0.391, 95% CI-0.46–-0.31, p <0.0001). 67% less chances of mortality in patients on steroids (RR = 0.33, 95% CI 0.19–60, p = 0.0012). Mean duration of ICU stay (days) was 8 (± 5, range 29, 95% CI 7.5–8.4). Conclusions: We observed that a strict adherence to the basic principles of ARDS management resulted in a lower mortality in ICU setting.","Pandit, R. A.; Gagana, B.

The purpose of this study is to explore the characteristics of this innovative product that were most salient to consumers and in so doing, to provide preliminary insights into the factors related to its success. Design/methodology/approach: Using a grounded theory approach in this qualitative study, the authors investigated a sample of 500 online consumer reviews of 100 different Airbnb OE. The analysis identified five major themes associated with reviewers’ positive evaluations of OEs. Findings: The study’s findings corroborate prior research on peer-to-peer businesses regarding the centrality of the host and the social appeal of such services, yet they also reveal newer, multifaceted expectations for OEs’ hosts. Further, consumers reacted positively to both the entertaining and educational aspects of OEs. Finally, reviewers’ comments reflect factors related to pandemic-related conditions such as seeking social interaction and virtual escape, yet they also identify factors that suggest the durative appeal of OEs as a tourism product (e.g. “repeatability” of OEs;OEs as sites for virtual connection with family/friends;OEs as a marketing tool for future travel). Originality/value: To the best of my knowledge, this is one of the first studies investigating this recently launched virtual tourism product.

This research applied the qualitative research method. Data collection sources included both a systematic literature review relating to how COVID-19 informed online distance learning across the globe and an analysis of circulars germane to the pandemic that were issued by the Ministry of Education (MOE) in Saudi Arabia and by Prince Sattam bin Abdulaziz University (PSAU). Guided by those two types of data, that is, review of the literature in general and the MOE and PSAU circulars in particular, and also illuminated by their own experiences of online teaching during the lockdown, the researchers were able to put forward those priorities. For the systematic review of the literature, five steps were performed: (1) identifying search terms and developing and applying a search strategy;(2) screening the obtained research papers, removing duplicates and papers outside the focal point, and establishing inclusion/exclusion criteria;(3) assessing the research papers against the inclusion/exclusion criteria;(4) data extraction;and (5) data synthesis. Although this article does not suggest traditional IHE should go entirely digital, it highlights the need for IHE to ensure access to online learning content, develop more partnerships with community, develop online self-study skills, get students to shift from passive to active learning, and a need to reconsider current e-assessment. Additionally, the study emphasizes the need to provide additional support for faculty members, how university buildings should be gradually reopened, controlling factors influencing online learning outcomes, and addressing the issue of dropouts in IHE. Finally, the study underlines the need to add further emphasis to the importance of integrating blended learning in the university curriculum and navigating toward developing global distance learning programs.","Sharadgah, Talha A.; Sa’di, Rami A.",E-Learning and Digital Media,213,25

The study adopted the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) Model with an extension to include two variables of Perceived Autonomy (PA) and Absorptive Capacity (AC). The study has also investigated the moderating effects of Culture (CUL) on the relationship between the independent and dependent variables. The study was conducted using primary data collected from 490 respondents, who were university students and intended to use MOOCs. The study used structural equation modelling (SEM) to evaluate the relationship between study variables in AMOS 26. The findings of the study indicated that Perceived Autonomy (PA) was found to have a positive and significant effect on Behavioral intention to use MOOCs (BI);Facilitating Conditions (FCS) has a positive and significant effect on Behavioral intention to use MOOCs (BI). Absorptive capacity (AC) has a positive and significant effect on Behavioral intention to use MOOCs (BI);Social Influence (SI) has a positive and significant effect on Behavioral intention to use MOOCs (BI). However, the results indicated that Performance Expectancy (PE) and Effort Expectancy (EE) have a non-significant effect on BI. Additionally, Perceived Autonomy has a positive and significant effect on Performance Expectancy and Effort Expectancy. The results of interaction between Culture and independent variables (PE, EE, SI, FC, AC, & PA) indicated that CUL does not moderate any relationship with dependent variable (BI).

This article therefore presents a “third act” in which dramaturgical perspectives are used to deliver an actor-and-audience centered analysis of crisis management. This third act is built around the dramaturgical concept of “characterization,” which we introduce to assess how an audience receives the symbolic outputs and discourses that are produced by crisis actors. After this theorizing, we present an analytical model, which will allow future researchers to analyze the interplay between actor, audience, and legitimacy when examining crisis.

Olfactory rods arise within a few hours of the olfactory pit opening, increase in numbers and size during larval stages, and can develop in the absence of olfactory cilia. Olfactory rod cells differ in morphology from the known classes of olfactory sensory neuron, but express reporters driven by neuronal promoters. The cells also differ from secondary sensory cells such as hair cells of the inner ear or lateral line, or sensory cells in the taste bud, as they are not associated with established synaptic terminals. A sub-population of olfactory rod cells expresses a Lifeact-mRFPruby transgene driven by the sox10 promoter.

This is a qualitative study, and data are collected from publiclyavailable sources (i.e., official announcements, policy amendments, derogations) in order to inductively analyze how individual VSS have adjusted their certification services in response to travel bans and lockdowns. The emphasis of the analysis was understanding the role of technologies in the VSS responses to the COVID-19 crisis. The findings demonstrate significant uptake of remote auditing and information and communications technology (ICT), even though that uptake is constrained by limiting conditions and it is not currently expected by VSS to extend beyond the crisis. Lessons learned from the crisis are discussed, and the potential for remote auditing during this period to encourage the adoption of more advanced technologies (such as artificial intelligence and satellite monitoring) in certification services is explored.

Methods This is a phase 2, prospective, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, and multi-centre study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidate MVC-COV1901. The study comprised 3,844 participants of [≥] 20 years who were generally healthy or with stable pre-existing medical conditions. The study participants were randomly assigned in a 6:1 ratio to receive either MVC-COV1901 containing 15 mcg of S-2P protein or placebo containing saline. Participants received two doses of MVC-COV1901 or placebo, administered 28 days apart via intramuscular injection. The primary outcomes were to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of MVC-COV1901 from Day 1 (the day of first vaccination) to Day 57 (28 days after the second dose). Immunogenicity of MVC-COV1901 was assessed through geometric mean titres (GMT) and seroconversion rates (SCR) of neutralising antibody and antigen-specific immunoglobulin. This clinical trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT04695652. Findings From the start of this phase 2 trial to the time of interim analysis, no vaccine-related Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) was recorded. The most common solicited adverse events across all study participants were pain at the injection site (64%), and malaise/fatigue (35%). Fever was rarely reported (<1%). For all participants in the MVC-COV1901 group, at 28 days after the second dose against wild type SARS-CoV-2 virus, the GMT was 662.3 (408 IU/mL), the GMT ratio was 163.2, and the seroconversion rate was 99.8%. Interpretation MVC-COV1901 shows good safety profiles and promising immunogenicity responses.

To solve this problem, a novel Stance Extraction and Reasoning Network (SERN) is proposed to extract the stances implied in post-reply pairs implicitly and integrate the stance representations for fake news detection without manually labeling stances, which saves much time and effort. Besides, the adequate utilization of multimodal content in the news is beneficial for complementing information for unimodal representation and jointly improving decision confidence. Thus, a sentence-guided visual attention mechanism is proposed in the text-image fusion module that leverages text-image content for better fake news detection.

Time series analysis is of great importance to determine both the similarity in the behavior of COVID-19 in certain countries/states and the establishment of models that can analyze and predict the transmission process of this infectious disease. In this contribution, an analysis of the different states of the United States will be carried out to measure the similarity of COVID-19 time series, using dynamic time warping distance (DTW) as a distance metric. A parametric methodology is proposed to jointly analyze infected and deceased persons. This metric allows comparison of time series that have a different time length, making it very appropriate for studying the United States, since the virus did not spread simultaneously in all the states/provinces. After a measure of the similarity between the time series of the states of United States was determined, a hierarchical cluster was created, which makes it possible to analyze the behavioral relationships of the pandemic between different states and to discover interesting patterns and correlations in the underlying data of COVID-19 in the United States. With the proposed methodology, nine different clusters were obtained, showing a different behavior in the eastern zone and western zone of the United States. Finally, to make a prediction of the evolution of COVID-19 in the states, Logistic, Gompertz and SIR models were computed. With these mathematical models, it is possible to have a more precise knowledge of the evolution and forecast of the pandemic.","Rojas-Valenzuela, Ignacio Valenzuela Olga Delgado-Marquez Elvira Rojas Fernando",Engineering Proceedings,213,1

As documented by literature, health professionals are at higher risk than the general population regarding their mental welfare. The study's objective was to measure the anxiety levels and its determinants of general practitioners of a French department during the first COVID-19 pandemic containment. Materials and Methods A survey through a self-completion questionnaire was sent to 250 general practitioners of the Bouches-du-Rhône department. Their anxiety state was measured using the Spielberg validated questionnaire the STAI-Y. Their experience, work organizations, and doctor/patient relationship were measured by ad hoc items developed during a focus group of five general practitioners. Results Of the 60 general practitioners included in the survey, nearly 40% had high to very high levels of anxiety. The determinants of this anxiety were the female gender, the unsatisfactory working conditions, the constrains required to work reorganization (consultations and waiting room), and the worry of not being able to respond to the fears and questions of patients, thus a lower decision latitude in their work. Conclusion This survey documented the levels of general practitioners’ anxiety, as well as the determinants of this anxiety. Physicians offered a unanimous opinion of their general feeling of ""disorganization and loneliness"". General practitioners have demonstrated great adaptability and flexibility despite the difficulties, which has caused them major anxiety. This pandemic's resultant experiences can help better understand the vulnerability of caregivers to mental anguish/stress in order to strengthen primary prevention strategies. Résumé Objectifs La pandémie de COVID-19 a fortement touché la France et a mis à rude épreuve les professionnels de santé. Étant déjà plus à risque que la population générale sur le plan de la santé mentale, l'objectif de cette étude était de mesurer les niveaux d'anxiété et ses déterminants des médecins généralistes d'un département français, pendant la première période de confinement. Méthode Une enquête a été envoyée à 250 médecins généralistes du département des Bouches-du-Rhône. Leur état d'anxiété a été mesuré par le questionnaire de Spielberg. Leur vécu, l'organisation du travail et la relation médecin/patient ont été mesurés par des items ad-hoc. Résultats Sur les 60 médecins généralistes inclus, près de 40% présentaient des niveaux d'anxiété élevés à très élevés. Les déterminants de cette anxiété étaient le sexe féminin, les conditions de travail insatisfaisantes, les contraintes de la réorganisation du travail (consultations et salle d'attente), et le souci de ne pas pouvoir répondre aux craintes et interrogations des patients donc une moindre latitude décisionnelle dans leur travail. Conclusion Les résultats ont documenté les niveaux d'anxiété des médecins généralistes, ainsi que ses déterminants. Dans cette enquête, les médecins ont exprimé une opinion unanime sur leur sentiment général de «désorganisation et solitude». Ils ont fait preuve d'une grande adaptabilité et flexibilité malgré les difficultés, ce qui leur a causé une anxiété importante. Le vécu de cette pandémie peut aider à mieux comprendre la vulnérabilité des soignants à la souffrance psychologique afin de renforcer les stratégies de prévention primaire.","Jenna, Luzet AnyA Beltran Anzola Marc Gilibert Barthelemy Tosello Catherine Gire",La Presse Médicale Open,213,15

We conducted a test-negative case-control study to assess the durability of protection after full vaccination with BNT162b2, defined as 14 days after the second dose, against polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-confirmed symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection, in a national medical practice between February 1, 2021 and August 22, 2021. We fit conditional logistic regression (CLR) models stratified on residential county and calendar time of testing to assess the association between time elapsed since vaccination and the odds of symptomatic infection or non-COVID-19 hospitalization (negative control), adjusted for several covariates. The primary population included 652 individuals who had a positive symptomatic test after full vaccination with BNT162b2 (cases) and 5,946 individuals with at least one negative symptomatic test after full vaccination (controls). The adjusted odds of symptomatic infection were higher 120 days after full vaccination versus at the date of full vaccination (Odds Ratio [OR]: 3.21, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.33-7.74). Importantly, the odds of infection were still lower 150 days after the first BNT162b2 dose as compared to 4 days after the first dose (OR: 0.3, 95% CI: 0.19-0.45), when immune protection approximates the unvaccinated status. Low rates of COVID-19 associated hospitalization or death in this cohort precluded analyses of these severe outcomes. The odds of experiencing a non-COVID-19 hospitalization decreased with time since vaccination, suggesting a possible underestimation of waning protection by this approach due to confounding factors. Taken together, these data constitute an early signal for waning protection against symptomatic illness while also providing reassurance that BNT162b2 continues to protect against symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection several months after full vaccination. Continued surveillance of COVID-19 vaccine durability, particularly against severe disease, is critical to guide effective and equitable strategies to respond to the pandemic, including distribution of booster doses, development of new vaccines, and implementation of both pharmaceutical and nonpharmaceutical interventions.","Puranik, A.; Lenehan, P.; O'Horo, J.

Conducted in the summer of 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic, this rapid review brings together literature and evidence to inform planning for remote and blended teacher education during restrictions in face-to-face teaching activity. The review consists of three main parts: first, a descriptive framework of modes of remote and blended teacher education;second, an exploratory review of the affordances and limitations of remote and blended approaches connecting the literature on effective teacher education with reviews of remote and blended approaches;third, a rapid review of evidence on the efficacy of remote and blended approaches, including of a small number of studies comparing these to face-to-face equivalents. We conclude that remote and blended teacher education is likely to become an increasingly important part of the teacher education landscape and there are plausible theoretical reasons suggesting that it can be effective with suitable design. However, we find too few studies presenting robust evidence to enable firm conclusions to be drawn on the relative effectiveness of modes and approaches.

At the level of higher education, this problem has been especially relevant due to the difficulties of restructuring learning and to the feeling of isolation that has been generated due to the forced migration of face-to-face teaching processes to virtual environments. This contribution analyzes a pedagogical and technological proposal for the design of CSCL (Computer Supported Collaborative Learning) which underlie the need to structure cognitive, social and organizational interactions that converge in a successful training framework. The purpose of the study is to understand the aspects that must be considered in the interaction for the expected learning to take place and to analyze the perceptions of the students in relation to the types of interaction that occur in the collaborative learning process. The study follows a non-experimental quantitative methodology, through a questionnaire, and had the participation of 106 students from 5 undergraduate subjects that implement CSCL. The results show that students associate cognitive, social and organizational interaction with motivation and improvement of academic performance, highlighting the development of skills to collaborate in the future and valuing the feelings of belonging to the learning community linked to the experience.","Hernandez-Selles, N.",Revista Publicaciones,213,1

Therefore, understanding the characteristics that influence the interactivity and the relationship between an organization and its page visitors is essential for the capability of an organization ability to respond to the current and potential customers on social networking sites in an appropriate manner. The research investigates how companies using brand communities on Face book influence consumers' intention to purchase through online interactivity, responsiveness, and personalization. In an online experiment, participants viewed selected records of communication with customers from companies on Face book pages that differed as to whether and how specifically the companies responded to their consumers. The results were obtained using mediation analyses. These indicate that perceptions of company responsiveness and personalization, based on existing consumer interactions on a Face boo к page, influence how participants rated the company, the quality of their own potential company interactions, and the likelihood of them purchasing products from the company in future. The findings of this research also support the assertion that social media has an impact on brand communities as a platform on which consumers interact. Additionally, eye tracking was used to collect data about customers' activities that assist in understanding how people acquire information from web pages. The research provides a better understanding of which distinct components of a message meaningfully influence perceptions of interactivity. The findings show that marketers should focus on customer complaints as this component of the messages on social media influences the viewer's visual search.

Free cancer cells might induce or indicate an early peritoneal seeding with a subsequent peritoneal metastasis. The aim of this study was to determine the frequency of the presence of free cancer cells in the peritoneal cavity in the patients surgically treated for gastric adenocarcinoma, and its relation to certain clinical, operative and pathohistological paramethers. METHODS Inside a period from April 2000, and April 2004, the total of 100 patients underwent intraoperative peritoneal lavage for cytological examination. Immediately after the laparotomy, 200 ml physiologic saline, heated to 37 degrees C, was introduced into the abdominal cavity, mannualy dispersed and collected from the region around the gastric tumor and the pouch of Douglas. The nucleated cell layer was smeared on four glass slides for every patient and dyed with May-Grünwald-Giemsa stain. The cytological findings were defined as positive or negative according to the presence of cancer cells. The frequency of positive cytological findings was compared to the location and the diameter of the cancer, pathohistological type of carcinoma, pathohistological stage of the disease, lymph node and the liver and/or peritoneal metastases and the type of surgical procedure. RESULTS Free cancer cells were found in 24 (24%) of the patients, while in 76 (76%) of them cytological findings were negative. A statistically highly significant difference (p < or = 0.001) in the frequency of positive cytological finding was found between the groups of patients with and without cancer invasion of serosa, with cancer diameters > 5 cm and < or = 5 cm, in the stage of disease I, II and III, IV, with macroscopically present and without metastases, with re section and D2 lymphadenectomy and palliative procedure. Free cancer cells were statistically more frequently (p < or = 0.05) detected in the patients with lymph nodes metastases comparing to the patients with out lymph nodes involvement. The results of the univariate analysis showed that the cancer diameter > 5 cm, tumor invasion of serosa, pathohistological stage of the disease III and IV and macroscopically visible metastases were the most important risk factors for the free cancer cells detection. CONCLUSION Peritoneal lavage cytology was shown to be a useful tool for the detection of the group of patients with greatest risk of peritoneal dissemination. The frequency of positive cytological findings was highly associated with the diameter of the tumor and the cancer invasion of serosa. Cytological examination of peritoneal lavage fluid improved the accuracy of staging and selection of patients who might have benefit from neoadjuvant chemotherapy.","Kostić, Zoran; Cuk, Vladimir; Bokun, Radojka; Ignjatović, Dragan; Usaj-Knezević, Slavica; Ignjatović, Mile",Vojnosanitetski pregled,213,1

The vagus nerve represents one of the main components of the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous system and is involved in important neurophysiological functions. Previous studies have shown that vagal nerve stimulation is effective in the treatment of resistant major depression, epilepsy and anxiety disorders. In EFD's there are a spectrum of symptoms which with Transcutaneous auricular Vagus Nerve Stimulation (Ta-VNS) therapy could have a therapeutic efficacy. SUBJECTS AND METHODS Sample subjects is composed by 15 female subjects aged 18-51. Admitted to a psychiatry community having diagnosed in according to DSM-5: anorexia nervosa (AN) (N=9), bulimia nervosa (BN) (N=5), binge eating disorder (BED) (N=1). Psychiatric comorbidities: bipolar disorder type 1 (N=4), bipolar disorder type 2 (N=6), border line disorder (N=5). The protocol included 9 weeks of Ta-VNS stimulation at a frequency of 1.5-3.5 mA for 4 hours per day. The variables detected in four different times (t0, t1, t2, t3, t4) are the following: Heart Rate Variability (HRV), Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD-HDRS-17), Body Mass Index (BMI), Beck Anxiety Index (BAI). RESULTS Data analysis showed statistically significant differences between recording times (p>0.05) in HAM-D (t0=18.28±5.31; t4=9.14±7.15), in BAI (t0=24.7±10.99; t4=13.8±7.0) the reported values show how during (T0-T4) the treatment there are a decay of the degree in the depressive state, in the state of anxiety and an improvement in the value of BMI. In particular, the BMI in the AN-BN sub-sample had a minimum gain of 5% and a maximum of 11%. The analysis of H.R.V. did not show a significant changes among subjects thus confirming the discordance of the activity of the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous system in EFD's. CONCLUSIONS Although the sample does not possess a relevant value to determine long-term efficacy of Ta-VNS or on a larger number of patients, this study reports how the application of neuro-stimulation in EFD's may become an ADD-ON in therapeutic approach. Indeed, substantial improvements are highlighted in the results and confirmed hypotheses proposed by the study.","Melis, Yuri; Apicella, Emanuela; Macario, Marsia; Dozio, Eugenia; Bentivoglio, Giuseppina; Mendolicchio, Leonardo",Psychiatria Danubina,213,23

Formal veterinary education in Australia has a history of over 100 years and veterinarians have played a major role in the control of zoonotic and transboundary diseases for an even longer period. Australia is the largest exporter of red meat and live animals in the world. Therefore, educating veterinarians to promote and ensure food safety and animal welfare is prominent in Australian veterinary curricula. Veterinary degrees are accredited to allow Australian graduates to work professionally overseas, including in the United Kingdom and United States of America, and, in recent years, globalisation of the student body at Australian veterinary schools has occurred. For this reason, an appropriately broad curriculum is required to produce graduates who are able to address challenges in veterinary public health throughout the world. A Public Health University Network has been established to harmonise the veterinary public health curricula at the various veterinary schools and to develop the 'Australian veterinary public health philosophy', with its links to global issues and the 'One World, One Health' concept. Finally, conclusions are drawn on the implications of veterinary public health teaching in Australia and the preparation of Australian graduates for the global profession.","Fenwick, S G; Robertson, L; Wilks, C R",Revue scientifique et technique,213,7

Poisson regression models were fitted to weekly numbers of cause-specific hospitalisation in Hong Kong from 2005 to 2010. Excess hospitalisation associated with the 2009 pandemic and seasonal influenza was derived from the model by incorporating the proxy variables of weekly proportions of specimens positive for the pandemic influenza A(H1N1)pdm09, seasonal influenza A (subtypes H3N2 and H1N1) and B viruses. Compared with seasonal influenza, pH1N1 influenza was associated with higher hospitalisation rates for acute respiratory disease (ARD) among children younger than 18 years and adults aged between 18 and 64 years, but among the elderly aged 65 years and older the hospitalisation rates were lower for pH1N1 than for seasonal H3N2 and H1N1 influenza.

The objective of this study was to determine the importance of hMPV infection in children in Beijing and the genotypes of the circulating virus by the surveillance during a four-consecutive-year period. METHODS Clinical specimens collected from children with ARTI from January 2006 to December 2009 were tested for hMPV by RT-PCR using primers targeting the matrix (M) gene, followed by genotyping of hMPV directly from positive samples by diplex PCR with primers for glycoprotein (G) genes. Sequence analysis was used for genotyping of those un-typable samples. Common respiratory viruses in these clinical specimens were tested by virus isolation and antigen detection, in addition to hMPV detection. RESULTS Of 4730 tested specimens, 191 (4.0%) were positive for hMPV and 62.8% of 191 were identified as genotype A. The positive rate of hMPV from hospitalized patients was higher than that from outpatients each year. Most of hMPV positive children were under five years old. The peak of hMPV activity mostly occurred in late spring and overlapped with or followed that of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and followed by parainfluenza virus 3. Of hMPV infected cases, 68.6% were lower respiratory tract infection, among which 79.4% were hospitalized, and upper respiratory tract infection was diagnosed for 31.4% of hMPV infected children. The 9.4% of hMPV positive samples were found to co-exist with other respiratory viruses. CONCLUSIONS hMPV was an important pathogen for ARTI in pediatric patients, especially those under five years old.

We aim to estimate inequities in infection fatality rates (IFR) in New Zealand by ethnicity. METHODS We combine existing demographic and health data for ethnic groups in New Zealand with international data on COVID-19 IFR for different age groups. We adjust age-specific IFRs for differences in unmet healthcare need, and comorbidities by ethnicity. We also adjust for life expectancy reflecting evidence that COVID-19 amplifies the existing mortality risk of different groups. RESULTS The IFR for Māori is estimated to be 50% higher than that of non-Māori, and could be even higher depending on the relative contributions of age and underlying health conditions to mortality risk. CONCLUSIONS There are likely to be significant inequities in the health burden from COVID-19 in New Zealand by ethnicity. These will be exacerbated by racism within the healthcare system and other inequities not reflected in official data.

There are multiple resources available to train providers in ultrasound, but they are all associated with significant cost. The Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) mandates anesthesiology residents to be competent in diagnostic and therapeutic uses of ultrasound. In this paper, we describe how an academic anesthesiology department implemented a POCUS curriculum for resident training. Methods: An anesthesiologist intensivist directed program was created to train residents in POCUS. We started by training a group of seven critical care trained anesthesiologists with the guidance of cardiologists. These anesthesiologists participated in the training of our anesthesiology residents. A hybrid curriculum consisting of a simulator as well as hands-on scanning of patients was created. We recorded the time that personnel spent in the training program as well as the money spent in acquiring equipment. Results: Seven faculty utilized a total of 270 hours of scanning and teaching time to train 48 residents who rotated through the ICU between July 2017 and June 2018. Simulation technicians used 48 hours to guide residents through simulation scenarios. The education administrator used 24 hours to coordinate sessions for residents. The technician and coordinator were both employees of the department with no additional cost for their responsibilities. The cost of equipment, including the ultrasound machine and simulator, was $45,000. An additional charge of $3500 was incurred for technician training time. Conclusion: Implementing a robust, sustainable POCUS curriculum requires a significant investment of time and money. Simulators and e-learning can allow efficiency in resource allocation and control cost in orienting new students to ultrasound. Having residents go through the simulator decreased the time that faculty would otherwise have spent going over basics with the students while allowing students to master these skills at their own pace. Advances in ultrasound technology have created newer, more affordable machines which can decrease cost considerably. It would serve departments well to consider alternatives and plan for resources when deciding to implement POCUS curriculum for resident training.","Deshpande, Ranjit; Karnik, Ruchika; Baer, Christine; Kurup, Viji",The Yale journal of biology and medicine,213,19

The aim of this study is to discuss the clinical significance of the one-stop hybrid endarterectomy surgery in the treatment of complex ischemic cerebrovascular diseases. In this study, clinical data from 10 patients with complex ischemic cerebrovascular diseases (including multi-vessel severe stenosis of the internal extracranial carotid artery, single vessel series stenosis of the internal extracranial carotid artery, in-stent restenosis, complete occlusion of the common carotid or the internal carotid artery) admitted to Beijing Xuanwu Hospital and Liaocheng Brain Hospital, were retrospectively analyzed. All enrolled subjects underwent three types of hybrid operations. The clinical efficacy of this surgery was subsequently assessed in this clinical trial. The results indicated that no related surgical complications were noted during the perioperative period. Intraoperative and postoperative imaging revealed no signs of vascular stenosis, the blood supply recovered, and clinical symptoms were alleviated. The follow-up lasted for 6 to 12 months. Imaging re-examination showed no evidence of re-stenosis and good blood circulation was present in the recanalized blood vessels. Favorable treatment efficacy was achieved. The intracranial blood supply was significantly improved postoperatively. In conclusion, one-stop hybrid operation plays an important role in treating complex stenosis cerebrovascular diseases.","Zhang, Liyong; Xing, Tao; Geng, Fenyang; Du, Lixin; Wang, Jiyue",International journal of clinical and experimental pathology,213,4

In order to further develop a macaque model, we expanded our previous in vivo genomics experiments with influenza virus-infected macaques by focusing on the innate immune response at day 2 postinoculation and on gene expression in affected lung tissue with viral genetic material present. Finally, we sought to identify signature genes for early infection in whole blood. For these purposes, we infected six pigtailed macaques (Macaca nemestrina) with reconstructed influenza A/Texas/36/91 virus and three control animals with a sham inoculate. We sacrificed one control and two experimental animals at days 2, 4, and 7 postinfection. Lung tissue was harvested for pathology, gene expression profiling, and proteomics. Blood was collected for genomics every other day from each animal until the experimental endpoint. Gross and microscopic pathology, immunohistochemistry, viral gene expression by arrays, and/or quantitative real-time reverse transcription-PCR confirmed successful yet mild infections in all experimental animals. Genomic experiments were performed using macaque-specific oligonucleotide arrays, and high-throughput proteomics revealed the host response to infection at the mRNA and protein levels. Our data showed dramatic differences in gene expression within regions in influenza virus-induced lesions based on the presence or absence of viral mRNA. We also identified genes tightly coregulated in peripheral white blood cells and in lung tissue at day 2 postinoculation. This latter finding opens the possibility of using gene expression arrays on whole blood to detect infection after exposure but prior to onset of symptoms or shedding.","Baas, T; Baskin, C R; Diamond, D L; García-Sastre, A; Bielefeldt-Ohmann, H; Tumpey, T M; Thomas, M J; Carter, V S; Teal, T H; Van Hoeven, N; Proll, S; Jacobs, J M; Caldwell, Z R; Gritsenko, M A; Hukkanen, R R; Camp, D G; Smith, R D; Katze, M G",Journal of virology,213,1

Influenza immunization rates by home ranged from 15.4 to 90% (mean 45%). There were no differences in the distribution of medical conditions by home. The highest immunization rates were seen in people with chest disease (77%), heart disease (60%), diabetes (56%), and those with three medical conditions (75%).

However, due to the lack of efficient algorithms for accurate RNA structure-sequence alignment, computer programs capable of fast and effectively searching genomes for RNA secondary structures have not been available. In this paper, a novel RNA structure profiling model is introduced based on the notion of a conformational graph to specify the consensus structure of an RNA family. Tree decomposition yields a small tree width t for such conformation graphs (e.g., t = 2 for stem loops and only a slight increase for pseudo-knots). Within this modelling framework, the optimal alignment of a sequence to the structure model corresponds to finding a maximum valued isomorphic subgraph and consequently can be accomplished through dynamic programming on the tree decomposition of the conformational graph in time O(k(t)N(2)), where k is a small parameter; and N is the size of the projiled RNA structure. Experiments show that the application of the alignment algorithm to search in genomes yields the same search accuracy as methods based on a Covariance model with a significant reduction in computation time. In particular; very accurate searches of tmRNAs in bacteria genomes and of telomerase RNAs in yeast genomes can be accomplished in days, as opposed to months required by other methods.

It is not clear, however, how DSI affects sleep characteristics. For patients receiving mechanical ventilation, we compared the effect on sleep quality of DSI and continuous sedation (CS). Twenty-two mechanically ventilated patients who were receiving midazolam by infusion were randomly assigned to two groups, DSI (n = 11) or CS (n = 11). In the DSI group, sedatives were interrupted until the patients awoke and expressed discomfort, after which midazolam or opioids were administered intermittently as needed during the daytime (0600 to 2100 hours); during the night (2100 to 0600) midazolam was administered intravenously to maintain Ramsay sedation scale 4 to 5. In the CS group, the sedatives were titrated to obtain Ramsay sedation scale 4 to 5 throughout the day. The polysomnography of each patient was recorded continuously over a 24 hour period. Sleep stages were analysed using Rechtschaffen and Kales criteria. In the DSI group, the amount of stage 3 and 4 non-rapid eye movement sleep (slow wave sleep) was longer (6 vs 0 minutes, P = 0.04) and rapid eye movement sleep was longer than in CS (54 vs 0 minutes, P = 0.02). In the CS group, total sleep time during night-time was longer (8.7 vs 7.3 hours, P = 0.047) and frequency of arousal was lower (2.2 vs 4.4 event/hour, P = 0.03) than those in the DSI group. All mechanically ventilated patients demonstrated abnormal sleep architecture, but, compared with CS, DSI increased the amount of slow wave sleep and rapid eye movement sleep.","Oto, J; Yamamoto, K; Koike, S; Imanaka, H; Nishimura, M",Anaesthesia and intensive care,213,7

A number of conserved negatively charged amino acids are located within domain III in the carboxy end of all coronavirus N proteins. Previous studies suggested that the negatively charged residues are involved in virus assembly by mediating interaction between the membrane (M) protein carboxy tail and nucleocapsids. To determine the importance of these negatively charged residues, a series of alanine and other charged-residue substitutions were introduced in place of those in the N gene within a mouse hepatitis coronavirus A59 infectious clone. Aspartic acid residues 440 and 441 were identified as functionally important. Viruses could not be isolated when both residues were replaced by positively charged amino acids. When either amino acid was replaced by a positively charged residue or both were changed to alanine, viruses were recovered that contained second-site changes within N, but not in the M or envelope protein. The compensatory role of the new changes was confirmed by the construction of new viruses. A few viruses were recovered that retained the D441-to-arginine change and no compensatory changes. These viruses exhibited a small-plaque phenotype and produced significantly less virus. Overall, results from our analysis of a large panel of plaque-purified recovered viruses indicate that the negatively charged residues at positions 440 and 441 are key residues that appear to be involved in virus assembly.","Verma, Sandhya; Bednar, Valerie; Blount, Andrew; Hogue, Brenda G",Journal of virology,213,28

Although the detailed mechanism of the antimicrobial activity of tea catechins remains to be explored, the broad-spectrum activity of catechins may involve common target(s), such as the cell membrane, in addition to specific targets for each pathogen. This extends to antiviral activities, where many pronounced activities were reported for enveloped viruses. Yet, the effectiveness of tea catechins as antimicrobials is compromised by relative chemical instability and poor bioavailability. Whether tea catechins will emerge as a viable option as alternative medicine or as a synergistic combination therapy with pre-existing antivirals or antibiotics must therefore depend on a method of delivery that ensures its stability and bioavailability. However, green tea may provide an option for mitigating the health and economic burdens associated with emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases, especially considering the paucity of effective control measures. Considering the zoonotic nature of newly arising infectious diseases, the dual use of green tea components in both humans and livestock may reduce animal-human transmission, which would complement the current management of infectious diseases.","Song, Jae Min; Seong, Baik Lin",Expert review of anti-infective therapy,213,17

The mutant, Albany 4 (Alb4), is both temperature sensitive and thermolabile. Analysis of the progeny of a mixed infection showed that the defective Alb4 allele is recessive to wild type, and its gene product is diffusible. The N protein of Alb4 was found to be smaller than its wild-type counterpart, and sequence analysis of the Alb4 N gene revealed that it contains an internal deletion of 87 nucleotides, producing an in-frame deletion of 29 amino acids. All of these properties of Alb4 made it ideal for use as a recipient in a targeted RNA recombination experiment in which the deletion in Alb4 was repaired by recombination with synthetic RNA7, the smallest MHV subgenomic mRNA. Progeny from a cotransfection of Alb4 genomic RNA and synthetic RNA7 were selected for thermal stability. Polymerase chain reaction analysis of candidate recombinants showed that they had regained the material that is deleted in the Alb4 mutant. They also had acquired a five-nucleotide insertion in the 3' untranslated region, which had been incorporated into the synthetic RNA7 as a molecular tag. The presence of the tag was directly verified, as well, by sequencing the genomic RNA of purified recombinant viruses. This provided a clear genetic proof that the Alb4 phenotype was due to the observed deletion in the N gene. In addition, these results demonstrated that it is possible to obtain stable, independently replicating progeny from recombination between coronavirus genomic RNA and a tailored, synthetic RNA species.","Koetzner, C A; Parker, M M; Ricard, C S; Sturman, L S; Masters, P S",Journal of virology,213,16

The phylogenetic analysis of the sequence data produced during these studies has identified four groups of avian astroviruses circulating in the United States: turkey astrovirus types 1 and 2 (TAstV-1 and TAstV-2), avian nephritis virus (ANV), and a chicken-origin astrovirus (CAstV). As the molecular epidemiology of poultry enteric disease is poorly understood, the development of updated diagnostic assays is crucial to the continued surveillance and management of enteric disease in affected as well as healthy flocks. This report details the development of a multiplex reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay specific for astroviruses and avian rotavirus in turkey-origin and chicken-origin samples. The assay consists of two multiplex tests, one for turkey-origin samples and one for chicken-origin samples. The turkey sample test differentially identifies TAstV-1, TAstV-2, ANV, and avian rotavirus. The test for chicken-origin samples differentially identifies CAstV, ANV, and avian rotavirus. Assay sensitivity varied by target sequence between approximately 10 copies for avian rotavirus alone and approximately 2 x 10(6) copies for TAstV-2 in the presence of a heterologous competitor RNA sequence. Each test was shown to be specific for the intended target by testing for cross-reaction with other common avian enteric viruses. The specificity was further shown by testing 109 chicken specimens and 32 turkey specimens from commercial flocks with the appropriate test and sequencing the RT-PCR amplicons to confirm amplification of the correct target.","Day, J Michael; Spackman, Erica; Pantin-Jackwood, Mary",Avian diseases,213,33

In the context of studying influenza infection and vaccine development, serial bronchoscopic procedures, including bronchial brush biopsies and bronchoalveolar lavage, were performed in pigtailed macaques (Macaca nemestrina). The possible need for oxygen supplementation during these procedures was anticipated because of the size of the animals relative to the 5-mm bronchoscope. We therefore monitored oxyhemoglobin saturation, a measure of arterial blood oxygen content, before and after insertion of the bronchoscope, during bronchoalveolar lavage, and after initiation of oxygen supplementation. Although more data are required to draw definitive conclusions, our findings suggested the need for oxygen supplementation during such procedures in nonhuman primates, despite the fact that human patients undergoing bronchoscopy and lavage do not routinely get oxygen unless they are already compromised. Our data also suggested that the need for supplementation could not be predicted from simple parameters such as size of the animal, presence of respiratory clinical signs, or experimental treatment. Finally, we show a simple and cost-effective method of using human nasal cannulas for delivering oxygen to pigtailed macaques during bronchoscopic procedures, and we believe that, after further testing, this method could be used safely and effectively in other nonhuman primate species.","Thomas, Matthew J; Flanary, Leon R; Brown, Bruce A; Katze, Michael G; Baskin, Carole R",Journal of the American Association for Laboratory Animal Science : JAALAS,213,9

RECENT FINDINGS New pathogens previously not associated with human infections have been identified in the past few years. In addition, new strains of bacteria and viruses have emerged as the causative agents of pneumonia and acute respiratory distress. Protozoans and saprophytic fungi, which are not normally associated with respiratory infection, have also emerged as respiratory pathogens particularly in individuals with AIDS or in those who are otherwise immunocompromised.

The outcome of tularemia will depend on rapid insertion of appropriate antibiotics. Until recently, effective clinical handling was hampered by shortcomings in laboratory diagnostics. No suitable direct methods were available and, because of risks and isolate recovery difficulties associated with laboratory work, culture has been rarely practiced. Due to achievements from work on modern technology, however, tularemia can now be rapidly and specifically diagnosed. Conventional PCR has been successfully applied on wound specimens of patients acquiring tularemia, and prospects for application on other human specimens are promising. Besides allowing diagnostics at high sensitivity and specificity, the PCR technology will also facilitate the identification of cases of tularemia presenting with aberrant signs and symptoms. Antibiotics for efficacious treatment of tularemia have been available for several decades. Although highly valuable, these drugs are afflicted with adverse effects and/or are available only for parenteral therapy.

Several issues, however, pertaining to their association with psychosocial, seizure-related and medication factors, remain controversial. Accordingly, the present study was designed to investigate the association of interictal mood disorders with various demographic and seizure-related variables in patients with newly-diagnosed and chronic epilepsy. METHODS We investigated 201 patients with epilepsy (51.2% males, mean age 33.2 +/- 10.0 years, range 16-60) with a mean disease duration of 13.9 +/- 9.5 years. Depression and anxiety were assessed in the interictal state with the Beck Depression Inventory, 21-item version (BDI-21) and the state and trait subscales of the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI-S and STAI-T), respectively. The association of mood disorders with various variables was investigated with simple and multiple linear regression analyses. RESULTS High seizure frequency and symptomatic focal epilepsy (SFE) were independent determinants of depression, together accounting for 12.4% of the variation of the BDI-21. The STAI-S index was significantly associated with the type of epilepsy syndrome (SFE). Finally, high seizure frequency, SFE and female gender were independent determinants of trait anxiety accounting for 14.7% of the variation of the STAI-T. CONCLUSION Our results confirm the prevailing view that depression and anxiety are common psychological disorders in epileptics.

Here we present the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in adult patients with active cancer in a nonendemic cancer center at the time of the study. METHODS All adult patients with an active history of cancer undergoing any elective surgery were screened for SARS-CoV-2 symptoms, including fever ≥ 38 degrees Celsius, chills, dyspnea, cough, sputum production, pharyngitis, myalgia/arthralgia, headache, anosmia, and nasal discharge. Both symptomatic and asymptomatic patients were tested for SARS-CoV-2 preoperatively via nasopharyngeal swab within 48 hours of surgery using an RT-PCR assay. Active cancer was defined as receipt of chemotherapy and/or radiation within 1 year of the SARS-CoV-2 test. Deidentified, institutional review board-exempt patient data were analyzed with IBM Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) Version 26. RESULTS Between March 16, 2020 and June 30, 2020, a total of 227 patients were tested preoperatively for SARS-CoV-2. Median age was 64.0 years (range 21 to 90). The majority of the cohort were White. Only 2 patients (0.8%) were positive for SARS-CoV-2. One 73-year-old woman undergoing hip replacement had Stage IV breast cancer and a 75-year-old man undergoing port placement had Stage IV retroperitoneal leiomyosarcoma. Neither patient had symptoms of SARS-CoV-2, underwent hospitalization for SARS-CoV-2, or proceeded to have the scheduled surgery after the positive test results until a 14-day quarantine period and a subsequent negative test result. Both patients subsequently received the procedures they were originally scheduled for with no complications. CONCLUSION Careful consideration of resource allocation and treatment limitations for cancer patients should occur in lower endemic regions.","Puckett, Yana; Wilke, Lee; Weber, Sharon; Parkes, Amanda; LoConte, Noelle K",WMJ : official publication of the State Medical Society of Wisconsin,213,1

It is assumed that asynchronies worsen lung function and prolong the duration of mechanical ventilation (MV). Neurally Adjusted Ventilatory Assist (NAVA) is a novel approach to MV based on neural respiratory center output that is able to trigger, cycle, and regulate the ventilatory cycle. We hypothesized that the use of NAVA compared to conventional lung-protective MV will result in a reduction of the duration of MV. It is further hypothesized that NAVA compared to conventional lung-protective MV will result in a decrease in the length of ICU and hospital stay, and mortality. METHODS/DESIGN This is a prospective, multicenter, randomized controlled trial in 306 mechanically ventilated patients with acute respiratory failure from several etiologies. Only patients ventilated for less than 5 days, and who are expected to require prolonged MV for an additional 72 h or more and are able to breathe spontaneously, will be considered for enrollment. Eligible patients will be randomly allocated to two ventilatory arms: (1) conventional lung-protective MV (n = 153) and conventional lung-protective MV with NAVA (n = 153). Primary outcome is the number of ventilator-free days, defined as days alive and free from MV at day 28 after endotracheal intubation. Secondary outcomes are total length of MV, and ICU and hospital mortality. DISCUSSION This is the first randomized clinical trial examining, on a multicenter scale, the beneficial effects of NAVA in reducing the dependency on MV of patients with acute respiratory failure.

Early indications point to lab infection in new SARS case.,13.02686,8.80216,2003,"Infection by human immunodeficiency virus type I requires the fusogenic activity of gp41, the transmembrane subunit of the viral envelope protein. Crystallographic studies have revealed that fusion-active gp41 is a ""trimer-of-hairpins"" in which three central N-terminal helices form a trimeric coiled coil surrounded by three antiparallel C-terminal helices. This structure is stabilized primarily by hydrophobic, interhelical interactions, and several critical contacts are made between residues that form a deep cavity in the N-terminal trimer and the C-helix residues that pack into this cavity. In addition, the trimer-of-hairpins structure has an extensive network of hydrogen bonds within a conserved glutamine-rich layer of poorly understood function. Formation of the trimer-of-hairpins structure is thought to directly force the viral and target membranes together, resulting in membrane fusion and viral entry. We test this hypothesis by constructing four series of gp41 mutants with disrupted interactions between the N- and C-helices. Notably, in the three series containing mutations within the cavity, gp41 activity correlates well with the stability of the N-C interhelical interaction. In contrast, a fourth series of mutants involving the glutamine layer residue Gln-653 show fusion defects even though the stability of the hairpin is close to wild-type. These results provide evidence that gp41 hairpin stability is critical for mediating fusion and suggest a novel role for the glutamine layer in gp41 function.","Suntoke, Tara R; Chan, David C",The Journal of biological chemistry,213,16

PV persists in the CNS of infected paralysed mice for over a year after the acute phase of paralytic poliomyelitis. However, infectious PV particles cannot be recovered from homogenates of CNS from paralysed mice after the acute phase of disease, indicating that PV replication is restricted. To identify the molecular mechanism by which PV replication is limited, PV RNA synthesis was analysed by estimating the relative level of genomic (plus-strand) and complementary (minus-strand) PV RNA in the CNS of persistently infected mice. PV RNA replication decreased during the 6 months following onset of paralysis, due mainly to inhibition of plus-strand RNA synthesis. Thus, restriction of PV RNA synthesis may contribute to persistence by limiting virus replication in the mouse CNS. Interestingly, viral RNA replication was similarly inhibited in neuroblastoma IMR-32 cell cultures persistently infected with PV. This in vitro model thus shows that cellular factors play a role in the inhibition of viral RNA synthesis.","Girard, Sophie; Gosselin, Anne-Sophie; Pelletier, Isabelle; Colbère-Garapin, Florence; Couderc, Thérèse; Blondel, Bruno",The Journal of general virology,213,1

To verify the feasibility of obtaining high-level expression of the SARS subunit vaccine and to provide a suitable plant-derived vaccine production platform against the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), a 193-amino acid fragment of SARS CoV spike protein receptor-binding domain (RBD), fused with the peptide vector cholera toxin B subunit (CTB), was expressed in tobacco chloroplasts. Codon-optimized CTB-RBD sequence was integrated into the chloroplast genome and homoplasmy was obtained, as confirmed by PCR and Southern blot analysis. Western blot showed expression of the recombinant fusion protein mostly in soluble monomeric form. Quantification of the recombinant fusion protein CTB-RBD was conducted by ELISA analysis from the transplastomic leaves at different developmental stages, attachment positions and time points in a day and the different expression levels of the CTB-RBD were observed with the highest expression of 10.2% total soluble protein obtained from mature transplastomic leaves. Taken together, our results demonstrate the feasibility of highly expressing SARS subunit vaccine RBD, indicating its potential in subsequent development of a plant-derived recombinant subunit vaccine and reagents production for antibody detection in SARS serological tests.","Zhong, Xue; Qi, Guangxun; Yang, Jing; Xing, Guojie; Liu, Jianfeng; Yang, Xiangdong",Sheng wu gong cheng xue bao = Chinese journal of biotechnology,213,19

RT-PCR assays targeted different genomic regions and included three conventional assays (one nested and two non-nested) run on a conventional heat block and four real-time assays performed in a LightCycler (LC; Roche Diagnostics). All in-house assays were optimized for assay parameters, including MgCl2, primer, and probe concentrations. The commercial assay was the RealArt HPA CoV RT-PCR assay (Artus), which was run in the LC. Testing serial dilutions of cultured SARS-CoV showed that the analytical sensitivity of the assays ranged from 10(-8) to 10(-6), corresponding to 1 and 100 copies of viral RNA, respectively. Significant differences in analytical sensitivities were observed between assays (P < 0.01, probit regression analysis for 50% sensitivity levels for the top two assays versus the others). Testing 68 clinical specimens (including 17 respiratory tract specimens, 29 urine samples, and 22 stools or rectal swabs) demonstrated that six of the seven assays detected at least 17 of 18 positives (defined as positive in at least two assays), and two of the assays had a sensitivity of 100%. There were no significant differences in sensitivity between the assays (P = 0.5 [Cochrance Q test, least sensitive 15 of 18 versus 18 of 18]). The specificities of the assays ranged from 94.0 to 100% without significant differences (P = 0.25 to 0.5 [McNemar test]).

The most active compound, 2 [1-[(3'-allyl-2'-hydroxybenzylidene)amino]- 3-hydroxyguanidine], against the growth of MHV is about 376 times more active than hydroxyguanidine and about 564 times more active than HAG itself when the TCID50 values are compared. Plaque assays of MHV released from cells treated with these compounds suggest that SSB-HAG tosylate may inhibit the transcription of viral RNAs in virus-infected cells. Quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) analyses of two subsets show that the inhibitory activities correlate well with the electronic and the lipophilic parameters. The structural requirements for the antiviral activity of substituted SSB-HAG tosylate against coronaviral infection are stringent according to the inhibitory activities and QSAR analysis of these new compounds.","Wang, P H; Keck, J G; Lien, E J; Lai, M M",Journal of medicinal chemistry,213,19

New models that allow for analysis of cognitive function and sex differences are needed. OBJECTIVE To characterize serotonin 1A (5-HT(1A)) receptor binding potential (BP) and its relationship with specific characteristics of behavioral depression in cynomolgus monkeys. DESIGN A 23-month case-control study. SETTING Small social groups in the laboratory. Subjects Seventeen adult female cynomolgus monkeys. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Serotonin 1A receptor BP was examined by positron emission tomography using the radioligand 4,2""-(methoxyphenyl)-1-[2""-(N-2""-pyridinyl)-p-fluorobenzamido]ethylpiperazine in the raphe, amygdala, hippocampus, and anterior cingulate cortex in monkeys characterized by behavioral observation as depressed or not depressed. Aggression, submission, affiliation, pathologic behaviors, and activity levels were determined by behavioral observation. Heart rate and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal function were also determined. RESULTS Throughout the brain areas examined, there was a reduction in 5-HT(1A) BP in depressed monkeys. The 5-HT(1A) BP in the amygdala and hippocampus was associated with aggression and submission. Friendly interaction, grooming, and locomotion were associated with 5-HT(1A) BP in the left cingulate cortex, whereas attention directed toward the environment was associated with 5-HT(1A) BP in the right cingulate cortex. The 5-HT(1A) receptor BP was inversely associated with heart rate in the raphe, left cingulate, and right amygdala. CONCLUSIONS This is the fourth in a series of studies that suggest that depressive behavior in adult female cynomolgus monkeys is similar to that observed in humans. It has been observed in 2 large groups of monkeys randomly selected from feral populations, suggesting that the capacity for depression is inherent in the species. This animal model holds promise to further our understanding of the basic mechanisms of affective behavior, the neuropathophysiologic characteristics of depression and the cognitive dysfunction that accompanies them, genetic and environmental factors that may affect depression risk, and the role of reproductive function in the excess depression risk in women.","Shively, Carol A; Friedman, David P; Gage, H Donald; Bounds, Michael C; Brown-Proctor, Clive; Blair, Joseph B; Henderson, Jessica A; Smith, Michael A; Buchheimer, Nancy",Archives of general psychiatry,213,12

METHODS Four devices were used for liver parenchymal dissection in laparoscopic hepatic wedge resection, in pigs: monopolar high-frequency electric cautery attached AI (MCI) (n = 6), bipolar high-frequency electric cautery attached AI (BCI) (n = 6), bipolar tissue sealing system (LigaSure) attached AI (BSI) and an endoscopic stapling device (ECHELON FLEX ENDOPATH) (ES). In each group, burst pressures were tested using an electronic manometer, paying special attention to the location (s) of the first disruption (s). The dissected tissues were examined histologically. RESULTS Pressures used in electrosurgical devices attach AI were significantly higher compared to pressures used in a ES (P < 0.001). While thermal denaturation of the liver parenchyma occurred at approximately 2-3 mm of depth when bipolar high-frequency electric cautery was used for dissection, it reached up to more than 10 mm with monopolar high-frequency electric cautery. All of the first disruption points of stapling were at stapling line. CONCLUSIONS Electrosurgical devices with an automatic irrigation function are useful devices to dissect the liver parenchyma.","Ikeda, Tetsuo; Akahoshi, Tomohiko; Kawanaka, Hirofumi; Uchiyama, Hideaki; Yamashita, Yo-ichi; Morita, Masaru; Oki, Eiji; Saeki, Hiroshi; Sugimachi, Keishi; Ikegami, Toru; Yoshizumi, Tomoharu; Soejima, Yuji; Shirabe, Ken; Mimori, Koshi; Watanabe, Masayuki; Hashizume, Makoto; Maehara, Yoshihiko",Fukuoka igaku zasshi = Hukuoka acta medica,213,1

It is differentiated from autoerotic asphyxiation. The activity can cause long-term disability and death among youths. In 2008, CDC reported 82 deaths attributed to the choking game and other strangulation activities during the period 1995-2007; most victims were adolescent males aged 11-16 years. To assess the awareness and prevalence of this behavior among 8th graders in Oregon, the Oregon Public Health Division added a question to the 2008 Oregon Healthy Teens survey concerning familiarity with and participation in this activity. This report describes the results of that survey, which indicated that 36.2% of 8th-grade respondents had heard of the choking game, 30.4% had heard of someone participating, and 5.7% had participated themselves. Youths in rural areas were significantly more likely (6.7%) to have participated than youths in urban areas (4.9%). Choking game participation was higher among 8th graders who reported mental health risk factors (4.0%), substance use (7.9%), or both (15.8%), compared with those who reported neither (1.7%). Public health surveillance of these strangulation activities among youths should be expanded to better quantify the risks and understand the motives and circumstances surrounding participation. Parents, educators, counselors, and others who work with youths should be aware of strangulation activities and their serious health effects; they should watch for signs of participation in strangulation activities, especially among youths with suspected substance use or mental health risk factors.",,MMWR.

These parasites are transmitted by the bite of an infective female Anopheles sp. mosquito. The majority of malaria infections in the United States occur among persons who have traveled to areas with ongoing transmission. In the United States, cases can occur through exposure to infected blood products, by congenital transmission, or by local mosquitoborne transmission. Malaria surveillance is conducted to identify episodes of local transmission and to guide prevention recommendations for travelers. PERIOD COVERED This report covers cases with onset of illness in 2001. DESCRIPTION OF SYSTEM Malaria cases confirmed by blood film are reported to local and state health departments by health-care providers or laboratory staff. Case investigations are conducted by local and state health departments, and reports are transmitted to CDC through the National Malaria Surveillance System (NMSS). Data from NMSS serve as the basis for this report. RESULTS CDC received reports of 1,383 cases of malaria with an onset of symptoms in 2001 among persons in the United States or one of its territories. This number represents a decrease of 1.4% from the 1,402 cases reported for 2000. P. falciparum, P. vivax, P. malariae, and P. ovale were identified in 50.1%, 27.8%, 4.5%, and 3.6% of cases, respectively. Fourteen patients (1.0% of total) were infected by >/=2 species. The infecting species was unreported or undetermined in 179 (12.9%) cases. Compared with 2000, the number of reported malaria cases acquired in Africa increased by 13.2% (n = 886), whereas the number of cases acquired in Asia (n = 163) and the Americas (n = 240) decreased by 31.5% and 11.4%, respectively. Of 891 U.S. civilians who acquired malaria abroad, 180 (20.2%) reported that they had followed a chemoprophylactic drug regimen recommended by CDC for the area to which they had traveled. Two patients became infected in the United States, one through congenital transmission and one whose infection cannot be linked epidemiologically to secondary cases. Eleven deaths were attributed to malaria, 10 caused by P. falciparum and one caused by P. ovale. INTERPRETATION The 1.4% decrease in malaria cases in 2001, compared with 2000, resulted primarily from a decrease in cases acquired in Asia and the Americas, but this decrease was offset by an increase in the number of cases acquired in Africa. This decrease probably represents year-to-year variation in malaria cases, but also could have resulted from local changes in disease transmission, decreased travel to malaria-endemic regions, fluctuation in reporting to state and local health departments, or an increased use of effective antimalarial chemoprophylaxis. In the majority of reported cases, U.S. civilians who acquired infection abroad were not on an appropriate chemoprophylaxis regimen for the country in which they acquired malaria. PUBLIC HEALTH ACTIONS Additional information was obtained concerning the 11 fatal cases and the two infections acquired in the United States. Persons traveling to a malarious area should take one of the recommended chemoprophylaxis regimens appropriate for the region of travel, and travelers should use personal protection measures to prevent mosquito bites. Any person who has been to a malarious area and who subsequently develops a fever or influenza-like symptoms should seek medical care immediately and report their travel history to the clinician; investigation should include a blood-film test for malaria. Malaria infections can be fatal if not diagnosed and treated promptly. Recommendations concerning malaria prevention can be obtained from CDC by calling the Malaria Hotline at 770-488-7788 or by accessing CDC's Internet site at http://www.cdc.gov/travel.","Filler, Scott; Causer, Louise M; Newman, Robert D; Barber, Ann M; Roberts, Jacquelin M; MacArthur, John; Parise, Monica E; Steketee, Richard W",Morbidity and mortality weekly report.

A single-stage acellular dermal matrix and split-thickness skin graft reconstruction represents a simple and valuable surgical approach to achieving durable scalp coverage without requiring a donor-site or prolonged treatment. Reconstruction of full-thickness scalp defects with exposed calvarium is a difficult problem that generally requires local or free flap reconstruction. However, patients with significant medical comorbidities present a further challenge given the risks of a major surgical procedure. Simple skin graft directly onto bone frequently fails and does not provide durable coverage, while combined artificial skin substitute and split-thickness skin graft approach involves a prolonged treatment period with multiple-staged procedures. Herein, we present a case of an 82-year-old female patient with complex medical comorbidities with a large scalp defect and calvarial exposure following Moh's surgery.

Human genetic variation can affect disease progression and outcome, but little is known about genetic risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 infection. The coronaviruses SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 and HCoV-NL63 all utilize the human protein angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as the receptor to enter cells. We hypothesized that the genetic variability in ACE2 may contribute to the variable clinical outcomes of COVID-19. To test this hypothesis, we first conducted an in silico investigation of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the coding region of ACE2 gene. We then applied an integrated approach of genetics, biochemistry and virology to explore the capacity of select ACE2 variants to bind coronavirus spike protein and mediate viral entry. We identified the ACE2 D355N variant that restricts the spike protein-ACE2 interaction and consequently limits infection both in vitro and in vivo. In conclusion, ACE2 polymorphisms could modulate susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2, which may lead to variable disease severity.","Ren, Wenlin; Zhu, Yunkai; Lan, Jun; Chen, Hedi; Wang, Yuyan; Shi, Hongyang; Feng, Fei; Chen, Da-Yuan; Close, Brianna; Zhao, Xiaomin; Wu, Jianping; Tian, Boxue; Yuan, Zhenghong; Zhou, Dongming; Saeed, Mohsan; Wang, Xinquan; Zhang, Rong; Ding, Qiang",,213,16

People with disabilities often experience inequalities with access to healthcare services, resulting in increased costs of living with disability. The economic burden of living with a disability results in nearly $400 billion spent annually from combined public and private payor sources. Historically, disparities in healthcare are associated with intersections between race, culture, and environmental factors. Minority status also plays a significant role in health outcomes and studies have highlighted the additional burdens faced at the junction of race and disability status. COVID-19 changed the landscape of healthcare delivery in the United States, resulting in a drastic increase in telehealth utilization. Traditional non-medical barriers to persons with disability, such as unforeseen parking fees, are documented in the literature. However, conditions surrounding access to the necessary technology required to participate in a telehealth driven medical landscape are less clear.

In addition, the virus has been detected in different clinical specimens, suggesting a potential transmission by other routes, including blood transfusion. However, the potential risk of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 via blood products is still unclear. The aim of our study was to investigate the prevalence of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 among blood donors from South-Eastern Italy. Moreover, in the seropositive donors, we searched for the presence of the virus in nasopharyngeal swabs and in plasma samples. Overall, 1,797 blood donors from the Apulia region were tested for anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, using a commercially available assay. Only 18/1,797 donors (1.0%) tested positive for anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies; in none of them SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA was detected in nasopharyngeal swabs and in plasma samples. Our results indicate that most of the blood donors in Apulia remained uninfected during this wave of the pandemic; further, none had detectable virus both in nasopharyngeal swabs and in blood samples.

We show how the momentous events set in motion by the COVID-19 virus, and the structural drivers of inequity and racism that its spread exposed, challenge mental health research on gun trauma to better account for broader terrains of race and place, as well as the tensions, politics, and assumptions that surround guns in the U.S. more broadly. Doing so will broaden mental-health interventions into epidemics of U.S. gun trauma, and challenge mental health research better recognize structural biases inherent in its own purview. We frame the agenda through the rubric of structural competency, an emerging framework that systematically trains health care professionals and others to recognize ways that institutions, neighborhood conditions, market forces, public policies, and health care delivery systems shape symptoms and diseases. Developing a structural framework around research into U.S. gun violence addresses the risks, traumas, meanings, and consequences that firearms represent for all communities-and highlights the importance of a renewed focus on mental health and safety for communities of color. Recognizing how gun violence reflects and encapsulates structures helps mental health experts address common sense gun policies within broader contexts-by fighting against structural racism or racially inflected gun policies for instance, or against economic policies that undermine access to mental health care more broadly.","Metzl, Jonathan M; McKay, Tara; Piemonte, Jennifer L",Soc Sci Med,213,19

The current indispensable challenge lies in the development of universal virus repudiation systems that are reusable, and capable of inactivating pathogens, thus reducing risk of infection and transmission. In this review, science-based methods, mechanisms, and procedures, which are implemented in obtaining resultant antiviral coated substrates, used in the destruction of the strains of the different viruses, are reviewed. The constituent antiviral members are classified into a few broad groups, such as polymeric materials, metal ions/metal oxides, and functional nanomaterials, based on the type of materials used at the virus contamination sites. The action mode against enveloped viruses was depicted to vindicate the antiviral mechanism. We also disclose hypothesized strategies for development of a universal and reusable virus deactivation system against the emerging COVID-19. In the surge of the current, alarming scenario of SARS-CoV-2 infections, there is a great necessity for developing highly-innovative antiviral agents to work against the viruses. We hypothesize that some of the antiviral coatings discussed here could exert an inhibitive effect on COVID-19, indicated by the results that the coatings succeeded in obtaining against other enveloped viruses. Consequently, the coatings need to be tested and authenticated, to fabricate a wide range of coated antiviral products such as masks, gowns, surgical drapes, textiles, high-touch surfaces, and other personal protective equipment, aimed at extrication from the COVID-19 pandemic.","Pemmada, Rakesh; Zhu, Xiaoxian; Dash, Madhusmita; Zhou, Yubin; Ramakrishna, Seeram; Peng, Xinsheng; Thomas, Vinoy; Jain, Sanjeev; Nanda, Himansu Sekhar",,213,21

Flap ulceration occurred more frequently in the WB region (41.7 vs. 6.5%, p = .0123). The survey response rate was 63.6%. The majority of patients complete daily tasks with no/little impairment (76.2%), walk half a mile or more (85.7%), returned to work (86.6%), and fit shoes ""fair"" or ""well"" (71.4%). Most patients were ""very satisfied"" with heel/ankle function (71.4%) and would ""very likely"" undergo the same procedure if needed (76.2%). CONCLUSIONS: Free flap reconstruction in both the NWB Achilles tendon and WB heel pad has excellent limb salvage and flap survival rates. Patients were satisfied with heel/ankle function, but additional counseling is recommended for variance in appearance and higher ulceration rates in WB defects.","Grauberger, Jennifer N; Gibreel, Waleed O; Moran, Steven L; Carlsen, Brian T; Bakri, Karim",Microsurgery,213,1

Therefore, this paper establishes a comprehensive index of vulnerability to climate change based on the vulnerability scoring diagram (VSD) framework. Moran's I index is used to study the spatial evolution characteristics of vulnerability, and spatial regression analysis is used to explore the factors influencing the spatial distribution of vulnerability. The results show that (1) the climate change vulnerability of China has decreased over time, and the sensitivity state is relatively stable; however, the annual change in exposure and adaptive capacity is significant. (2) The western region of China is more vulnerable than the eastern region, and the most vulnerable provinces are Guizhou and Gansu. (3) The regional vulnerability is generally in a significant spatial agglomeration state. (4) Finally, the driving factors of the spatial distribution of climate change vulnerability include forest coverage, the urban-rural income gap and information technology. These recommendations provide detailed discussions and scientific information for mitigating global warming and formulating long-term emission reduction targets, thereby optimizing resource allocation and providing spatial governance directions for the formulation of adaptation policies.","Jiang, Huiqin; Yu, Yinhua; Chen, Miao-Miao; Huang, Wei",,213,32

Quarantine measures have influenced pregnant women's daily lives. The aim of this study is to understand the impact of the changes imposed by COVID-19 emergency on the wellbeing of pregnant women and how the transformation of Schiavonia Hospital into a dedicated Covid Hospital affected their pregnancy experience. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was conducted. Pregnant women who gave birth in Schiavonia Hospital during the period May-September 2020 have been included. The assessment examined clinical characteristics, attitudes in relation to the pandemic and how it affected birth plans, perception of information received and attitudes regards giving birth in a Covid Hospital. RESULTS: 104 women responded to the survey, with an enrolment rate of 58%. About the influence of COVID-19 pandemic, 51% of respondents reported changing some aspect of their lifestyle. The identification of Schiavonia hospital as Covid Hospital did not modify the trust in the facility and in the Obstetrics Ward for the 90% of women, in fact for the 85,6% it was the planned Birth Centre since the beginning of pregnancy.

With COVID-19 spreading across the world, it has become more pressing for medical professionals to better leverage artificial intelligence for faster and more accurate lung auscultation. This research aims to propose a feature engineering process that extracts the dedicated features for the depthwise separable convolution neural network (DS-CNN) to classify lung sounds accurately and efficiently. We extracted a total of three features for the shrunk DS-CNN model: the short-time Fourier-transformed (STFT) feature, the Mel-frequency cepstrum coefficient (MFCC) feature, and the fused features of these two. We observed that while DS-CNN models trained on either the STFT or the MFCC feature achieved an accuracy of 82.27% and 73.02%, respectively, fusing both features led to a higher accuracy of 85.74%. In addition, our method achieved 16 times higher inference speed on an edge device and only 0.45% less accuracy than RespireNet. This finding indicates that the fusion of the STFT and MFCC features and DS-CNN would be a model design for lightweight edge devices to achieve accurate AI-aided detection of lung diseases.","Jung, S.

The present study aimed to carry out a health impact assessment in Recife, Brazil, hypothesizing a scenario in which the levels of PM10 and PM2.5 remained, throughout the year, as in the most restrictive period of human mobility. Particular material data (PM10 and PM2.5) were measured during the pandemic and population and health (mortality, hospital admissions for heart and respiratory problems) data from 2018 were used. We observed a reduction in the concentration of PM2.5 in up to 43.7% and PM10 up to 29.5% during the period of social isolation in the city of Recife. The reduction in PM2.5 would avoid 106 annual deaths from non-external causes and 58 annual deaths from cardiovascular diseases. In this scenario, $ 294.88 million would be saved ($ 114.88 million from heart problems and $ 180 million from non-external causes). When considering hospitalizations avoided by the decrease in PM10, we observed 57 fewer hospitalizations for respiratory diseases, 42 for heart diseases and a reduction of 37 deaths due to non-external causes. The reduction in spending on respiratory and cardiovascular hospitalizations would exceed $ 330,000. Therefore, the reduction of particulate matter could prevent hospital admissions, deaths and consequently there would be a reduction in disease burden in developing countries where economic resources are scarce. In this sense, governments should seek to reduce levels of pollution in order to improve the life quality and health of the population.","Leão, Marcos Lorran Paranhos; Penteado, Julia Oliveira; Ulguim, Sabrina Morales; Gabriel, Rômulo Reginato; Dos Santos, Marina; Brum, Aline Neutzling; Zhang, Linjie; da Silva Júnior, Flavio Manoel Rodrigues",Environ. sci. pollut. res. int.

The dysregulated expression of the S100A11 gene has been implicated in tumour metastasis. However, the role of S100A11 protein in tumour cell response to chemotherapeutic drugs has not been characterised. METHODS: Transcript levels of S100A11 in gastric cancer were evaluated using an in-house patient cohort. Protein expression of S100A11 in gastric cancer was estimated by immunohistochemistry of a tissue microarray. The stable gastric cancer cell lines were established using lentiviral shRNA vectors. The knockdown of S100A11 was validated by qRT-PCR, PCR, and Western blot. The cellular function of S100A11 was estimated by assays of cell adhesion, migration, and invasion. The cell cytotoxic assay was performed to investigate the response to chemotherapeutic drugs. An unsupervised hierarchical clustering and principal component analysis (HCPC) was applied to unveil the dimensional role of S100A11 among all S100 family members in gastric cancer. RESULTS: High expression of S100A11 is associated with poor survival of gastric cancer patients (p < 0.001, HR = 1.85) and is an independent prognostic factor of gastric cancer. We demonstrate that S100A11 plays its role as a tumour promoter through regulating the MMP activity and the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) process. The stable knockdown of S100A11 suppresses the metastatic properties of gastric cancer cells, which include enhancing cell adhesion, but decelerating cell migration and invasion. Furthermore, the knockdown of S100A11 gene expression dramatically induces the cellular response of gastric cancer cells to the first-line chemotherapeutic drugs fluoropyrimidine 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and cisplatin. CONCLUSION: The present study identifies S100A11 as a tumour promoter in gastric cancer. More importantly, the S100A11-specific targeting potentially presents dual therapeutic benefits by not only controlling tumour progression but also sensitising chemotherapeutic cytotoxic response.","Cui, Yuxin; Li, Liting; Li, Zhilei; Yin, Jie; Lane, Jane; Ji, Jiafu; Jiang, Wen G",Cancer Cell Int,213,32

RESULTS: Our results have indicated that 47% of social media posts discussing vaccines were in a neutral tone, and nearly 17% of the social media posts discussing the COVID-19 vaccine were in a negative tone. Fear of health and allergic reactions towards the vaccine are the two prominent issues that concern Indian citizens regarding the COVID-19 vaccine. CONCLUSION: With the positive sentiments regarding vaccine is just over 35%, the Indian government needs to focus especially on addressing the fear of vaccines before implementing the process of mass vaccination.","Praveen, S V; Ittamalla, Rajesh; Deepak, Gerard",Diabetes Metab Syndr,213,14

The SARS-CoV­2 virus has been detected in renal tissue. Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) before and on dialysis and specifically renal transplant patients represent a particularly vulnerable population. The increasing number of COVID-19 infected patients with renal involvement led to an evolving interest in the analysis of its pathophysiology, morphology and modes of virus detection in the kidney. Meanwhile, there are ample data from several autopsy and kidney biopsy studies that differ in the quantity of cases as well as in their quality. While the detection of SARS-CoV­2 RNA in the kidney leads to reproducible results, the use of electron microscopy for visualisation of the virus is difficult and currently critically discussed due to various artefacts. The exact contribution of indirect or direct effects on the kidney in COVID-19 are not yet known and are currently the focus of intensive research.","Amann, K; Boor, P; Wiech, T; Singh, J; Vonbrunn, E; Knöll, A; Hermann, M; Büttner-Herold, M; Daniel, C; Hartmann, A",Pathologe,213,8

To address this safety concern, we investigated whether use of remdesivir for COVID-19 is associated with an increased risk of bradycardia. METHODS: Using VigiBase R, the World Health Organization Global Individual Case Safety Reports database, we compared the cases of bradycardia reported in COVID-19 patients exposed to remdesivir with those reported in COVID-19 patients exposed to hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir, tocilizumab or glucocorticoids. All reports of patients with COVID-19 registered up to the 23 September 2020 were included. We conducted disproportionality analyses allowing the estimation of reporting odds ratios (RORs) with 95% CI. RESULTS: We found 302 cardiac effects including 94 bradycardia (31%) among the 2603 reports with remdesivir prescribed in COVID-19 patients. Most of the 94 reports were serious (75, 80%), and in 16 reports (17%) evolution was fatal. Compared with hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir, tocilizumab or glucocorticoids, the use of remdesivir was associated with an increased risk of reporting bradycardia (ROR 1.65;95% CI 1.23-2.22). Consistent results were observed in other sensitivity analyses. DISCUSSION: This post-marketing study in a real-world setting suggests that the use of remdesivir is significantly associated with an increased risk of reporting bradycardia and serious bradycardia when compared with the use of with hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir, tocilizumab or glucocorticoids. This result is in line with the pharmacodynamic properties of remdesivir.","Touafchia, A.; Bagheri, H.; Carrie, D.; Durrieu, G.; Sommet, A.; Chouchana, L.; Montastruc, F.",Clinical Microbiology &amp; Infection,213,10

Under the situation of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic and the normalization of anti-epidemic, biosafety prevention and control is becoming more and more important, which is directly related to the development of society, economy and politics. At the beginning of COVID-19 epidemic, there was a serious lack of personal protective equipment, due to the shortage of medical emergency supplies and the lack of ability to public health emergencies. In the face of the severe challenge of the epidemic, interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary cooperation is the key to scientific epidemic prevention. The characteristics of the material, such as optical, electrical, acoustic, magnetic, thermal, are helpful for the design and preparation of multi-functional new materials, which can meet the requirements of biosafety prevention in detection, prevention and treatment. We should give full play to the advantages of biosafety and materials science. Using new biosafety materials to overcome the shortcomings of traditional materials can improve or provide new detection methods. Not only can we use biosafety materials to develop a variety of highly effective, low toxicity drugs and vaccines, but also to produce multifunctional masks and protective clothing. What we have done has contributed to the preparation of medical emergency supplies and to the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic. At the same time, the toxicity of new biosafety materials can not be ignored. Only by accelerating industrialization based on basic research and practical problems can we better cope with other emerging outbreaks of infectious diseases in the future.","Cai, ManYing Liao YuHui Xu Wei Zhou DongFang",Chinese Journal of Applied Chemistry,213,20

We develop a compartmental model for assessing the community-wide impact of mask use by the general, asymptomatic public, a portion of which may be asymptomatically infectious. Model simulations, using data relevant to COVID-19 dynamics in the US states of New York and Washington, suggest that broad adoption of even relatively ineffective face masks may meaningfully reduce community transmission of COVID-19 and decrease peak hospitalizations and deaths. Moreover, mask use decreases the effective transmission rate in nearly linear proportion to the product of mask effectiveness (as a fraction of potentially infectious contacts blocked) and coverage rate (as a fraction of the general population), while the impact on epidemiologic outcomes (death, hospitalizations) is highly nonlinear, indicating masks could synergize with other non-pharmaceutical measures. Notably, masks are found to be useful with respect to both preventing illness in healthy persons and preventing asymptomatic transmission. Hypothetical mask adoption scenarios, for Washington and New York state, suggest that immediate near universal (80%) adoption of moderately (50%) effective masks could prevent on the order of 17–45% of projected deaths over two months in New York, while decreasing the peak daily death rate by 34–58%, absent other changes in epidemic dynamics. Even very weak masks (20% effective) can still be useful if the underlying transmission rate is relatively low or decreasing: In Washington, where baseline transmission is much less intense, 80% adoption of such masks could reduce mortality by 24–65% (and peak deaths 15–69%), compared to 2–9% mortality reduction in New York (peak death reduction 9–18%). Our results suggest use of face masks by the general public is potentially of high value in curtailing community transmission and the burden of the pandemic. The community-wide benefits are likely to be greatest when face masks are used in conjunction with other non-pharmaceutical practices (such as social-distancing), and when adoption is nearly universal (nation-wide) and compliance is high.","Eikenberry, Steffen E.; Mancuso, Marina; Iboi, Enahoro; Phan, Tin; Eikenberry, Keenan; Kuang, Yang; Kostelich, Eric; Gumel, Abba B.",Infect.

The rapid spreading capability of the virus has compelled the world population to maintain strict preventive measures. The outrage of the virus has rampaged through the healthcare sector tremendously. This pandemic created a huge demand for necessary healthcare equipment, medicines along with the requirement for advanced robotics and artificial intelligence-based applications. The intelligent robot systems have great potential to render service in diagnosis, risk assessment, monitoring, telehealthcare, disinfection, and several other operations during this pandemic which has helped reduce the workload of the frontline workers remarkably. The long-awaited vaccine discovery of this deadly virus has also been greatly accelerated with AI-empowered tools. In addition to that, many robotics and Robotics Process Automation platforms have substantially facilitated the distribution of the vaccine in many arrangements pertaining to it. These forefront technologies have also aided in giving comfort to the people dealing with less addressed mental health complicacies.

The aim of this study was to assess the feasibility of a brief online Mindfulness and Compassion-based Intervention to promote mental health among first year university students during COVID-19 home confinement. Methods: Participants (n=66) were first-year psychology students from a university in Spain with no prior meditation experience. Intervention lasted for 16 days and was designed ad-hoc. Using a pre-post within-subjects design, feasibility was assessed in five domains (acceptability, satisfaction, implementation, practicality, and limited efficacy testing). Participants completed both baseline and post-intervention assessments of perceived stress, anxiety, and self-compassion. Results: The intervention showed to be feasible in all domains evaluated. It was implemented as planned with constrained resources, and limited efficacy testing showed promising results. After the intervention, stress and anxiety levels decreased significantly (p<0.001, Hedges's g=0.5146; p<0.001, Hedges's g=0.6068, respectively) whereas self-compassion levels were augmented significantly (p<0.001, Hedges's g=0.6968). Conclusions: Our findings suggest that a brief online mindfulness and compassion intervention may be a feasible way of promoting mental health among university students during COVID-19 lockdown. Further studies are required to address the limitations of the present study. We conclude that online interventions may constitute a promising pathway to buffer the mental health burden derived from the COVID-19 pandemic.","González-García, Marian; Álvarez, Jorge Crespo; Pérez, Elena Zubeldia; Fernandez-Carriba, Samuel; López, Javier González",Mindfulness (N Y),213,8

Many patients present with a remarkable disconnect in rest between profound hypoxemia yet without proportional signs of respiratory distress (i.e. happy hypoxemia) and rapid deterioration can occur. This particular clinical presentation in COVID-19 patients contrasts with the experience of physicians usually treating critically ill patients in respiratory failure and ensuring timely referral to the intensive care unit can, therefore, be challenging. A thorough understanding of the pathophysiological determinants of respiratory drive and hypoxemia may promote a more complete comprehension of a patient's clinical presentation and management. Preserved oxygen saturation despite low partial pressure of oxygen in arterial blood samples occur, due to leftward shift of the oxyhemoglobin dissociation curve induced by hypoxemia-driven hyperventilation as well as possible direct viral interactions with hemoglobin. Ventilation-perfusion mismatch, ranging from shunts to alveolar dead space ventilation, is the central hallmark and offers various therapeutic targets.","Dhont, Sebastiaan; Derom, Eric; Van Braeckel, Eva; Depuydt, Pieter; Lambrecht, Bart N",Respir Res,213,1

Coronavirus research is of significance to overcome the epidemic. Our study aims to investigate the global status and trends of coronavirus research. METHOD: Publications related to the studies of coronavirus research from January 1, 2003 to February 6, 2020 were retrieved from the Science Citation Index-Expanded (SCI-E) of the Web of Science database. A total of 9294 publications were included. The data source was studied and indexed by bibliometric methodology. For visualized study, bibliographic coupling analysis, co-authorship analysis, co-citation analysis, co-occurrence analysis and the analysis of publication trends in coronavirus research were conducted by VOS (visualization of similarities) viewer and GraphPadPrism 6 software. RESULTS: The number of publications about coronavirus research increased sharply in 2004 for SARS outbreak and increased again in 2012 for MERS outbreak. The USA made the highest contributions to the global research with the most total number of publications, total citation frequency, and the highest H-index, while Netherlands had the highest average citation per item. Journal of Virology had the largest publication numbers. The University of Hong Kong is the most contributive institution with the most publications. The main research orientation and funding agency were virology and United States Department of Health Human Services. Keywords of all related studies could be divided into 4 clusters: ""Pathological research,"" ""Epidemiology research,"" ""Clinical research,"" and ""Mechanism research."" CONCLUSIONS: The outbreak of the epidemic could promote coronavirus research, meanwhile, coronavirus research contributes to overcoming the epidemic. Attention should be drawn to the latest popular research, including ""Spike protein,"" ""Receptor binding domain,"" and ""Vaccine."" Therefore, more and more efforts will be put into mechanism research and vaccine research and development, which can be helpful to deal with the epidemic.","Mao, Xingjia; Guo, Lu; Fu, Panfeng; Xiang, Chuan",Medicine (Baltimore),213,22

Relative quantitative RT-PCR was used to detect the mRNA transcription level of selected egg-laying regulatory genes in the ovary tissues of ducks at different laying stages. Study shows: during the laying period of Pekin duck, ESR1, LRP1, IGF-1 and LHR were involved in the regulation of egg-laying, and the high expression of LRP1 in the late stage could inhibit egg production. Still, the expression products of the other three genes showed promoting effect. During the laying period of Black Muscovy duck, FSH, VLDLR, IGF-1, PRLR, LHR and LRP1 participated in the regulation of egg-laying, in which the expression products of the first five genes could promote egg production, while LRP1 showed inhibitory effect. Through our experiments, these data will provide strong theoretical support for the breeding of Pekin duck and Black Muscovy duck.","Liu, Guangyu; Zeng, Mingfei; Li, Xingxing; Rong, Yu; Hu, Zhigang; Zhang, Huilin; Liu, Xiaolin",Gene,213,1

Previously, remote home monitoring technology has been explored to augment in-person care. During the COVID-19 pandemic, traditional in-person care was limited and CF centers rapidly adapted to a telehealth delivery model. The purpose of this study was to understand how people with CF (PwCF) and families of PwCF experienced the shift to telehealthcare delivery. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional survey-based study conducted in 11 CF Centers. Two surveys were designed (one for adult PwCF and one for parents/guardians of PwCF) by participating CF center members with patient and family partner input. Surveys were disseminated electronically via email/text to all patients who completed a telehealth visit, and data were collected on secure Google Forms. RESULTS: Respondents rated their telehealth experiences as positive. Most were highly satisfied with their telehealth visit (77% adult, 72% pediatric) and found the visits to be highly convenient (85% for all surveyed). A majority of patients reported they had adequate time during the visit and had all questions and concerns addressed. Importantly, we also identified concerns regarding lack of in-person assessments including pulmonary function testing (PFT) and throat/sputum culture. CONCLUSION: Telehealth was a feasible and well-accepted mechanism for delivering care in a chronic CF care model during the COVID-19 pandemic and may be useful in the post-pandemic era. Further work is needed to understand the impact of telehealth on patient outcomes, healthcare utilization and associated cost.","Jaclyn, Davis; Andrew, NeSmith; Ryan, Perkins; Julianna, Bailey; Christopher, Siracusa; Nauman, Chaudary; Powers, M; Gregory S, Sawicki; George M, Solomon",J. cyst. fibros,213,1

As the disease is spreading rapidly all over the world, it is urgent to find effective drugs to treat the virus. The main protease (Mpro) of SARS-CoV-2 is one of the potential drug targets. Therefore, in this context, we used rigorous computational methods, including molecular docking, fast pulling of ligand (FPL), and free energy perturbation (FEP), to investigate potential inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro. We first tested our approach with three reported inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro, and our computational results are in good agreement with the respective experimental data. Subsequently, we applied our approach on a database of â¼4600 natural compounds, as well as 8 available HIV-1 protease (PR) inhibitors and an aza-peptide epoxide. Molecular docking resulted in a short list of 35 natural compounds, which was subsequently refined using the FPL scheme. FPL simulations resulted in five potential inhibitors, including three natural compounds and two available HIV-1 PR inhibitors. Finally, FEP, the most accurate and precise method, was used to determine the absolute binding free energy of these five compounds. FEP results indicate that two natural compounds, cannabisin A and isoacteoside, and an HIV-1 PR inhibitor, darunavir, exhibit a large binding free energy to SARS-CoV-2 Mpro, which is larger than that of 13b, the most reliable SARS-CoV-2 Mpro inhibitor recently reported. The binding free energy largely arises from van der Waals interaction. We also found that Glu166 forms H-bonds to all of the inhibitors. Replacing Glu166 by an alanine residue leads to â¼2.0 kcal/mol decreases in the affinity of darunavir to SARS-CoV-2 Mpro. Our results could contribute to the development of potential drugs inhibiting SARS-CoV-2.","Ngo, Son Tung; Quynh Anh Pham, Ngoc; Thi Le, Ly; Pham, Duc-Hung; Vu, Van V",J. chem. inf. model,213,21

This study sought to characterize challenges faced by physician mothers, compare differences in challenges by home and work characteristics, and elicit specific needs and potential solutions. Methods: We conducted a mixed-methods online survey of the Physician Moms Group (PMG) and PMG COVID19 Subgroup on Facebook from April 18th to 29th, 2020. We collected structured data on personal and professional characteristics and qualitative data on home and work concerns. We analyzed qualitative data thematically and used bivariate analyses to evaluate variation in themes by frontline status and children's ages. Results: We included 1,806 participants in analysis and identified 10 key themes. The most frequently identified need/solution was for Community and Government Support (n = 545, 47.1%). When comparing frontline and nonfrontline physicians, those on the frontline more frequently raised concerns about Personal Health and Safety (67.8% vs. 48.4%, p < 0.001), Organizational Communication and Relationships (31.8% vs. 23.8%, p < 0.001), and Family Health and Safety (27.2 vs. 16.6, p < 0.001), while nonfrontline physicians more frequently addressed Patient Care and Safety (56.4% vs. 48.2%, p < 0.001) and Financial/Job Security (33.8% vs. 46.9%, p < 0.001).

Yet, as practices and payment policies return to a new normal, there will be many questions about what proportion of visits should be done in-person vs telehealth. Using the 2016 National Ambulatory Medical Survey (NAMCS), we estimated what proportion of visits were amenable to telehealth before COVID-19 as a guide. We divided services into those that needed in-person care and those that could be done via telehealth. Any visit that included at least 1 service where in-person care was needed was counted as an in-person only visit. We then calculated what proportion of reported visits and services in 2016 could have been provided via telehealth, as well as what proportion of in-person only services were done by primary care. We found that 66% of all primary care visits reported in NAMCS in 2016 required an in-person service. 90% of all wellness visits and immunizations were done in primary care offices, as were a quarter of all Papanicolaou smears. As practices reopen, patients will need to catch up on many of the in-person only visits that were postponed such as Papanicolaou smears and wellness visits. At the same time, patients and clinicians now accustomed to telehealth may have reservations about returning to in-person only visits. Our estimates may provide a guide to practices as they navigate how to deliver care in a post-COVID-19 environment.","Jabbarpour, Yalda; Jetty, Anuradha; Westfall, Matthew; Westfall, John",J Am Board Fam Med,213,33

Here, a collective ensemble of multimicrosecond molecular dynamics characterizes the key dynamic determinants allowing nucleic acid processing in CRISPR-Cas12a. We show that DNA binding induces a switch in the conformational dynamics of Cas12a, which results in the activation of the peripheral REC2 and Nuc domains to enable cleavage of nucleic acids. The simulations reveal that large-amplitude motions of the Nuc domain could favor the conformational activation of the system toward DNA cleavages. In this process, the REC lobe plays a critical role. Accordingly, the joint dynamics of REC and Nuc shows the tendency to prime the conformational transition of the DNA target strand toward the catalytic site. Most notably, the highly coupled dynamics of the REC2 region and Nuc domain suggests that REC2 could act as a regulator of the Nuc function, similar to what was observed previously for the HNH domain in the CRISPR-associated nuclease Cas9. These mutual domain dynamics could be critical for the nonspecific binding of DNA and thereby for the underlying mechanistic functioning of the DETECTR technology. Considering that REC is a key determinant in the system's specificity, our findings provide a rational basis for future biophysical studies aimed at characterizing its function in CRISPR-Cas12a. Overall, our outcomes advance our mechanistic understanding of CRISPR-Cas12a and provide grounds for novel engineering efforts to improve genome editing and viral detection.","Saha, Aakash; Arantes, Pablo R; Hsu, Rohaine V; Narkhede, Yogesh B; Jinek, Martin; Palermo, Giulia",J. chem. inf. model,213,1

Fill rates for asthma controller medications decreased during this time (p = .03) and quick relief medication fill rates had no significant change (p = .31). Multiple factors may have contributed to the decrease in acute asthma health care visits. Locally, decreased air pollution and viral exposures coincided with the ""Stay-at-home"" order in Ohio, and increased utilization of telehealth for assessment during exacerbations may have impacted outcomes. Identification of the cause of the decline in visit rates could spur new interventions to limit the need for ED and inpatient visits for asthma patients, leading to both economic and health-associated benefits.","Ulrich, Lisa; Macias, Charlie; George, Ashish; Bai, Shasha; Allen, Elizabeth",Pediatr Pulmonol,213,33

Currently, effective treatment options remain very limited for this disease; therefore, there is an urgent need to identify new anti-COVID-19 agents. In this study, we screened over 6,000 compounds that included approved drugs, drug candidates in clinical trials, and pharmacologically active compounds to identify leads that target the SARS-CoV-2 papain-like protease (PLpro). Together with main protease (Mpro), PLpro is responsible for processing the viral replicase polyprotein into functional units. Therefore, it is an attractive target for antiviral drug development. Here we discovered four compounds, YM155, cryptotanshinone, tanshinone I and GRL0617 that inhibit SARS-CoV-2 PLpro with IC50 values ranging from 1.39 to 5.63 µmol/L. These compounds also exhibit strong antiviral activities in cell-based assays. YM155, an anticancer drug candidate in clinical trials, has the most potent antiviral activity with an EC50 value of 170 nmol/L. In addition, we have determined the crystal structures of this enzyme and its complex with YM155, revealing a unique binding mode. YM155 simultaneously targets three ""hot"" spots on PLpro, including the substrate-binding pocket, the interferon stimulating gene product 15 (ISG15) binding site and zinc finger motif. Our results demonstrate the efficacy of this screening and repurposing strategy, which has led to the discovery of new drug leads with clinical potential for COVID-19 treatments.","Zhao, Yao; Du, Xiaoyu; Duan, Yinkai; Pan, Xiaoyan; Sun, Yifang; You, Tian; Han, Lin; Jin, Zhenming; Shang, Weijuan; Yu, Jing; Guo, Hangtian; Liu, Qianying; Wu, Yan; Peng, Chao; Wang, Jun; Zhu, Chenghao; Yang, Xiuna; Yang, Kailin; Lei, Ying; Guddat, Luke W; Xu, Wenqing; Xiao, Gengfu; Sun, Lei; Zhang, Leike; Rao, Zihe; Yang, Haitao",Protein Cell (Online),213,20

In 2020, the WHO estimated that 8 million people have died due to smoking. Furthermore, smoking tobacco is a well-known risk factor for various infectious pulmonary diseases. The question raised, whether smoking is facilitating SARS-CoV-2-infections and increases adverse outcomes of COVID-19. To answer these questions a narrative review was conducted, finally including 7 systematic reviews with meta-analyses published in January and February 2021. Tobacco smoking was associated with an increased COVID-19 disease severity (odds ratio range of active vs. never smokers 1.55-2.19 and former vs. never smokers 1.20-2.48) and an increased COVID-19 in-hospital mortality (odds ratio range of active vs. never smokers 1.35-1.51 and former vs. never smokers 1.26-2.58). Beside immediate pulmonary toxic effects through active smoking, the cumulative livelong tobacco exposition and subsequent tobacco-associated diseases seem to predominantly predict adverse outcomes in patients with COVID-19. Data regarding an increased risk of infection among smokers is conflicting. However, a large observational study from England with 2.4 million persons reported an association between tobacco smoking and typical symptoms of COVID-19. For e-cigarettes and vaping less data exist, but experimental and first clinical investigations also suggest an increased risk for adverse outcomes for their use and SARS-CoV-2 infections. Especially during the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic with limited therapeutic options it is particularly important to advise smokers of their increased risks for unfavourable COVID-19 outcomes. Evidence based support for smoking cessation should be offered. In Germany, the existing and well-established methods to support tobacco cessation need to be reimbursed by statutory health insurances.","Raspe, Matthias; Bals, Robert; Hering, Thomas; Pankow, Wulf; Rupp, Alexander; Rustler, Christa; Urlbauer, Matthias; Andreas, Stefan",Pneumologie (Stuttg.),213,1

Since inflammation is one of the major causes of COVID-19 complications, the associated molecular mechanisms have been the focus of many studies to better understand this disease and develop improved treatments for patients contracting SARS-CoV-2. Among these, strong emphasis has been placed on pro-inflammatory cytokines, associating severity of COVID-19 with so-called ""cytokine storm."" More recently, peptide bradykinin, its dysregulated signaling or ""bradykinin storm,"" has emerged as a primary mechanism to explain COVID-19-related complications. Unfortunately, this important development may not fully capture the main molecular players that underlie the disease severity. To this end, in this focused review, several lines of evidence are provided to suggest that in addition to bradykinin, two closely related vasoactive peptides, substance P and neurotensin, are also likely to drive microvascular permeability and inflammation, and be responsible for development of COVID-19 pathology. Furthermore, based on published experimental observations, it is postulated that in addition to ACE and neprilysin, peptidase neurolysin (Nln) is also likely to contribute to accumulation of bradykinin, substance P and neurotensin, and progression of the disease. In conclusion, it is proposed that ""vasoactive peptide storm"" may underlie severity of COVID-19 and that simultaneous inhibition of all three peptidergic systems could be therapeutically more advantageous rather than modulation of any single mechanism alone.","Karamyan, Vardan T",Physiol Rep,213,16

This study examined adolescents' postquarantine depressive symptoms associated with pandemic stressors. The primary aim was to identify potential protective factors that may buffer the association between the presence of COVID-19 cases in adolescents' communities and their postquarantine depressive symptoms. METHODS: Adolescents from public schools were recruited from Zhengzhou city, Henan, China (N = 1,487, Mage=13.14 years, 50% girls). Adolescents reported the presence of confirmed or suspected COVID-19 cases in their communities, their daily activities and routines during the 2-month quarantine period, and depressive symptoms after the quarantine period. RESULTS: The presence of cases in adolescents' communities during the quarantine contributed to more depressive symptoms in adolescents after the quarantine. This association was buffered by adolescents' spending more time on physical activities and better maintenance of daily living routines during the quarantine period. The presence of community infection was also more strongly associated with depressive symptoms in older adolescents. CONCLUSIONS: The presence of COVID-19 cases in communities contributed to adolescents' poorer mental health, and the association was stronger for older adolescents. Spending time on physical activities and maintaining daily living routines during the quarantine appear to be practical strategies that can be used by adolescents to mitigate the association between pandemic stressors and their diminishing mental health.","Ren, Huiguang; He, Xing; Bian, Xiaohua; Shang, Xinhua; Liu, Junsheng",J Adolesc Health,213,20

Although several recent studies have analyzed these changes over different regions of the globe, these analyses have been constrained due to the usage of station-based data which is mostly limited upto the metropolitan cities. Also, the quantifiable changes have been reported only for the developed and developing regions leaving the poor economies (e.g. Africa) due to the shortage of in-situ data. Using a comprehensive set of high spatiotemporal resolution satellites and merged products of air pollutants, we analyze the air quality across the globe and quantify the improvement resulting from the suppressed anthropogenic activity during the lockdowns. In particular, we focus on megacities, capitals and cities with high standards of living to make the quantitative assessment. Our results offer valuable insights into the spatial distribution of changes in the air pollutants due to COVID-19 enforced lockdowns. Statistically significant reductions are observed over megacities with mean reduction by 19.74%, 7.38% and 49.9% in nitrogen dioxide (NO2), aerosol optical depth (AOD) and PM 2.5 concentrations.

In particular, two classification systems have been proposed: clinical classification, comprising primary (P-CIS), concomitant (C-CIS), and secondary (S-CIS) disease, and pathological classification, comprising P-CIS, cTa-CIS, and cT1-CIS. The aim of the present study was to assess the impact of both classifications on BCG response, recurrence-free survival (RFS), progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and cancer-specific survival (CSS). PATIENTS AND METHODS: We performed a retrospective analysis of 386 patients with bladder CIS, with or without associated cTa/cT1 disease, treated with BCG instillations between 2008 and 2015. Patients were stratified according to the two classification systems. Cox multivariate regression models were used to assess the impact of these subtypes on BCG response, RFS, PFS, OS, and CSS. We also performed a cumulative meta-analysis according to PRISMA guidelines. RESULTS: The median follow-up was 70.5 months. According to the clinical classification, 34 (8.8%) patients had P-CIS, 81 (21%) S-CIS, and 271 (70.2%) C-CIS. The pathological classification showed 34 (8.8%) patients to have P-CIS, 190 (49.2%) cTa-CIS, and 162 (42%) cT1-CIS. In the overall cohort, BCG response was reported in 296 (76.7%); 159 (41.2%) had recurrence, 55 (14.2%) had progression, and 67 (17.4%) underwent radical cystectomy. Death from any cause was recorded in 135 (35%) and death from urothelial carcinoma in 38 (9.9%). Cox multivariate regression analysis showed that neither clinical classification nor pathological classification is an independent predictive factor for BCG response, RFS, PFS, OS, or CSS after adjusting for confounders. In the pooled meta-analysis, two studies and the present series were included for evidence synthesis, recruiting a total of 941 patients. We found no statistically significant difference across the groups for both classifications with respect to BCG response, RFS, PFS, and CSS. CONCLUSIONS: Currently, the supporting evidence for an impact of clinical classification and pathological classification on oncological outcomes of CIS of the bladder is insufficient to justify their use to guide clinical management or follow-up.","Subiela, José Daniel; Faba, Óscar Rodríguez; Aumatell, Julia; Krajewski, Wojciech; Calderón, Julio; Parada, Rubén; Huguet, Jorge; Algaba, Ferran; Breda, Alberto; Palou, Joan",Urol. oncol,213,21

One of the measures was to restrict access to family members of hospitalized patients. The presence of the patient's family is considered an alternative to physical restraint. The aim of this study is to compare the use of physical restraint in hospitalized patients in an acute care hospital during the previous period of the pandemic of COVID-19 with the post-confinement period with hospitals being still closed to family. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We made an observational study that compares the prevalence of physical restraint in an acute care hospital during the previous period to the alarm state (February 2020) with the second period, when visits where restricted (May 2020). From the clinical history of the patients with physical restraint we collected the following variables: sex, diagnostic, hospital admission unit, reason for using physical restraint, localization, length, type of material, registration in the medical record, information given to the family, alternatives to the physical restraint and injuries related to the physical restraint. RESULTS: We evaluated 690 patients: 388 during the previous period and 320 during the second period. From all patients, 29 needed physical restraint. The use of physical restraint went from 8 (2%) to 21 (7%) (p=0.003). In the second period, a not statistically significant increase in continuous physical restraint was identified compared to the first period. CONCLUSIONS: The physical restraint prevalence has been superior during the second period in which families were not present with the hospitalized patients.","Font, R; Quintana, S; Monistrol, O",J. healthc. qual. res,213,16

Symptoms and radiological findings are often similar; conversely, treatments are quite different. Furthermore, we focus on potential interactions generating hypotheses that need confirmatory studies. EXPERT OPINION: All cancer patients treated with immunotherapy should receive screening for SARS-CoV-2. This would improve the diagnosis and management of pneumonia and guide therapeutic choices. Furthermore, clinicians could estimate the risk/benefit of continuing ICI treatment in COVID-19 positive patients.

Despite obvious short-term clinical benefit, long-term social impact and cost-effectiveness have not been fully investigated. AIM: Predictive modeling of long-term clinical and social outcomes and the cost-effectiveness analysis of blood pressure (BP) telemonitoring and remote counseling (BPTM) in patients with HTN. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A Markov cohort-based (1000 patients in each study arm) model was developed and adopted a 10-year time horizon with 12-month time cycles. Cost and outcome data collected from the three-month study of 240 patients (160 in BPTM group and 80 controls, 48 y.o.). All patients started at a non-complicated HTN well state with a certain possibility of disease progression in a number of health states over a discrete time period. BPTM was compared with usual care in terms of 10-year healthcare costs, quality adjusted life years (QALY) using a Ministry of Health of Russian Federation perspective. RESULTS: In the long-term run when compared with usual care BPTM was more effective in terms mortality (67 versus 91 patients lost and 9.6 versus 9.71 life years gained) and costs (cost of illness 102 508 000 RUR versus 145 237 700 RUR). Taking quality of life measures into account, the effect of BPTM was also more pronounced (8.31 versus 7.82 QALYs gained). The resultant incremental cost-utility ratio for BPTM was 275 178.98 RUR/1 QALY gained/1 patient (134 837.70 RUR/0.49 QALY/1 patient). CONCLUSION: According to the results of predictive modeling, implementation of BPTM into clinical practice is likely lead to reduced cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in a cost-effective way.","Ionov, M V; Zhukova, O V; Zvartau, N E; Konradi, A O",Ter Arkh,213,22

The death toll associated with the pandemic is increasing day by day. SARS-CoV-2 is an enveloped virus and its N terminal domain (NTD) of Nucleocapsid protein (N protein) binds to the viral (+) sense RNA and results in virus ribonucleoprotien complex, essential for the virus replication. The N protein is composed of a serine-rich linker region sandwiched between NTD and C terminal (CTD). These terminals play a role in viral entry and its processing post entry. The NTD of SARS-CoV-2 N protein forms orthorhombic crystals and binds to the viral genome. Therefore, there is always a quest to target RNA binding domain of nucleocapsid phosphoprotein (NTD-N-protein which in turn may help in controlling diseases caused by SARS-CoV-2 in humans.

A secondary aim was to evaluate the impact of government responses to the early inflow of infected cases. METHODS: Data on government responses weeks 8-14 were obtained from the Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker. Regional data on total all-cause mortality during weeks 14-23 in 2020 were retrieved from Eurostat and national statistical agencies and compared with the average mortality during same period 2015-2019. Variance-weighted least square regression was used with mortality difference as dependent variable with adjustment for country, population density and age distribution. RESULTS: Being a region with winter holiday exclusively in week 9 was in the adjusted analysis associated with 16 weekly excess deaths [95% confidence interval (CI) 13-20] per million inhabitants during weeks 14-23, which corresponds to 38% of the excess mortality in these regions. A more stringent response implemented in week 11, corresponding to 10 additional units on the 0-100 ordinal scale, was associated with 20 fewer weekly deaths (95% CI 18-22) per million inhabitants. CONCLUSIONS: Winter holiday in week 9 was an amplifying event that contributed importantly to the excess mortality observed in the study regions during the spring 2020. Timely government responses to the resulting early inflow of cases reduced the excess in mortality.","Björk, Jonas; Mattisson, Kristoffer; Ahlbom, Anders",Eur J Public Health,213,32

As well as SARS-CoV, SARS CoV-2 uses the 'Angiotensin Converting Enzyme-2' (ACE2) as a receptor to enter human cells. It was found that ACE2, Angiotensin (1-7) and its MAS receptors are present, over in the lung, also in the testicles, in particular in Leydig and Sertoli cells. A first hypothesis is that the virus could enter the testicle and lead to alterations in testicular functionality. A second hypothesis is that the binding of the virus to the ACE2 receptor, could cause an excess of ACE2 and give rise to a typical inflammatory response.

We evaluated the impact of vaccination on COVID-19 outbreak and disease outcomes in Ontario, Canada. METHODS: We used an agent-based transmission model and parameterized it with COVID-19 characteristics, demographics of Ontario, and age-specific clinical outcomes. We implemented a two-dose vaccination program according to tested schedules in clinical trials for Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines, prioritizing healthcare workers, individuals with comorbidities, and those aged 65 and older. Daily vaccination rate was parameterized based on vaccine administration data. Using estimates of vaccine efficacy, we projected the impact of vaccination on the overall attack rate, hospitalizations, and deaths. We further investigated the effect of increased daily contacts at different stages during vaccination campaigns on outbreak control. RESULTS: Maintaining non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) with an average of 74% reduction in daily contacts, vaccination with Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines was projected to reduce hospitalizations by 27.3% (95% CrI: 22.3% - 32.4%) and 27.0% (95% CrI: 21.9% - 32.6%), respectively, over a one-year time horizon. The largest benefits of vaccination were observed in preventing deaths with reductions of 31.5% (95% CrI: 22.5% - 39.7%) and 31.9% (95% CrI: 22.0% - 41.4%) for Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines, respectively, compared to no vaccination. We found that an increase of only 10% in daily contacts at the end of lockdown, when vaccination coverage with only one dose was 6%, would trigger a surge in the outbreak. Early relaxation of population-wide measures could lead to a substantial increase in the number of infections, potentially reaching levels observed during the peak of the second wave in Ontario. CONCLUSIONS: Vaccination can substantially mitigate ongoing COVID-19 outbreaks. Sustaining population-wide NPIs, to allow for a sufficient increase in population-level immunity through vaccination, is essential to prevent future outbreaks.","Vilches, Thomas N; Zhang, Kevin; Van Exan, Robert; Langley, Joanne M; Moghadas, Seyed M",Vaccine,213,21

They are curriculum issues not only because of the disrupting consequences of Covid-19 and the economic and social crisis alike but also because people have, through their own activities, contributed to global catastrophes and perpetuated injustices. This article attempts to answer the question: How does Finnish curricular thought, including the role of the teacher and the core curriculum for basic education, respond to the various global crises? While reviewing the current situation, the article also imagines a post-Covid-19 curriculum. Reactivating what is still powerful in Bildung/Didaktik and emphasizing the importance of education's ethical dimension and the teacher's role as a curriculum theorist offer the means for dealing with the theme. In addition, understanding the structure of the National Core Curriculum document, the political dimension of the Finnish curriculum's design process, and the educative possibilities in subjects and multidisciplinary modules, the teacher is capable of creating opportunities for educational experiences that are (ethically) significant for students, proactively and in terms of crises.","Hakala, Liisa; Kujala, Tiina",Prospects (Paris),213,1

We describe mortality and renal outcome in this group. METHODS: This observational study was conducted at a university hospital in Sweden. We studied critically ill adult COVID-19 patients with Acute Kidney injury (AKI) who received CRRT. RESULTS: In 451 patients, AKI incidence was 43.7%. 18.2% received CRRT. Median age of CRRT patients was 60 years (IQR 54-65), 90% were male, median BMI was 29 (IQR 25-32), 23.2% had Diabetes, 37.8% hypertension and 6.1% chronic kidney disease prior to admission. 100% required mechanical ventilation. 8.5% received Extra Corporeal Membrane Oxygenation. Median length of stay was 23 days (IQR 15-26). ICU mortality was 39% and 90-day mortality was 45.1%. Age, baseline creatinine values and body weight change were associated with 60 days mortality. Of the survivors, no patients required dialysis at hospital discharge, 73.8% recovered renal function and a median 10.5% of body weight was lost during admission. CONCLUSIONS: Critically ill COVID-19 patients with AKI who received CRRT had a 90-day mortality of 45.1%. At follow-up, three quarters of survivors had recovered renal function.

This pandemic demonstrates the importance of timely access to intensive care and, therefore, this study aims to explore the accessibility of intensive care beds in 14 European countries and its impact on the COVID-19 case fatality ratio (CFR). METHODS: We examined access to intensive care beds by deriving (1) a regional ratio of intensive care beds to 100,000 population capita (accessibility index, AI) and (2) the distance to the closest intensive care unit. The cross-sectional analysis was performed at a 5-by-5 km spatial resolution and results were summarized nationally for 14 European countries. The relationship between AI and CFR was analyzed at the regional level. RESULTS: We found national-level differences in the levels of access to intensive care beds. The AI was highest in Germany (AI = 35.3), followed by Estonia (AI = 33.5) and Austria (AI = 26.4), and lowest in Sweden (AI = 5) and Denmark (AI = 6.4). The average travel distance to the closest hospital was highest in Croatia (25.3 min by car) and lowest in Luxembourg (9.1 min). Subnational results illustrate that capacity was associated with population density and national-level inventories. The correlation analysis revealed a negative correlation of ICU accessibility and COVID-19 CFR (r = - 0.57; p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Geographical access to intensive care beds varies significantly across European countries and low ICU accessibility was associated with a higher proportion of COVID-19 deaths to cases (CFR). Important differences in access are due to the sizes of national resource inventories and the distribution of health-care facilities relative to the human population. Our findings provide a resource for officials planning public health responses beyond the current COVID-19 pandemic, such as identifying potential locations suitable for temporary facilities or establishing logistical plans for moving severely ill patients to facilities with available beds.","Bauer, Jan; Brüggmann, Dörthe; Klingelhöfer, Doris; Maier, Werner; Schwettmann, Lars; Weiss, Daniel J; Groneberg, David A",Intensive care med,213,16

American Academy of Ophthalmology and Center for Disease Control guidelines suggest mandatory masking of patients and physicians during outpatient visits. We have recently become aware of a mask-induced phenomenon, whereby the intraocular pressure (IOP) as measured by Goldmann applanation tonometry (GAT) is artificially elevated due to mechanical interference from the mask. CLINICAL PRESENTATION: A 37-year-old male with a history of primary open-angle glaucoma on triple therapy presented for a routine visit. CLINICAL FINDINGS: When measuring IOP by GAT the right eye measured 16 mm Hg, but the left eye measured 20 mm Hg. The patient's mask was noted to be touching the base of the sensor rod on the tonometer. This patient's IOP was falsely elevated due to the lateral edge of his mask touching the base of the applanation tonometer, changing the relationship between the bi-prism tip and the weighted balance below, and eliminating the weighted balance from the pressure measuring mechanism. The patient's mask was adjusted to ensure there was no touch and repeat measurement showed an IOP of 16 mm Hg in the left eye. CONCLUSION: Recognizing mask-induced alteration in IOP is essential as it could lead to unnecessary escalation of treatment. We recommend flattening the area of mask protrusion during applanation and ensuring that the sensor arm remains clear of the mask while the tonometer tip approaches the cornea, especially at the moment the mires become visible during corneal contact.","Davanian, Arash M; Donahue, Sean P; Mogil, Rachel S; Groth, Sylvia L",J. glaucoma,213,16

Both infected SD and WIS rats developed ISAR, but only WIS rats developed FGR despite both rat strains having equivalent microbial loads within the placenta. Neither maternal systemic inflammation nor placental (fetal) inflammation was a feature of FGR in WIS rats. Unique to infected WIS rats, was loss of trophoblast cell density within the junctional zone of the placenta that was not present in SD tissues. In addition, infected WIS rats had a higher proportion of junctional zone trophoblast cells positive for cytoplasmic high temperature requirement A1 (Htra1), a marker of cellular oxidative stress.

OBJECTIVE: The current study seeks to investigate the usage of RT in LGG and its effect on survival outcomes. METHODS: Patients with diagnosis codes specific for LGG were queried from the National Cancer Database (NCDB) during the years 2004-2016. Kaplan-Meier curves with log-rank testing, univariate and multivariate Cox regression analysis, and comparisons of estimated 3- and 7-year survival were performed to investigate the effect of RT on overall survival. RESULTS: 19,382 patients with LGG were identified with histologically confirmed disease. Kaplan-Meier testing demonstrated RT impacted survival in patients undergoing biopsy or no surgery (p < 0.0001), no chemotherapy (p < 0.0001), and in regimens with early RT (p < 0.0001) and high-dose RT (p < 0.0001).

We provide an explanation for this income effect based on the stringency of government response to the pandemic and the unequal distribution of agency among social classes. Design/methodology/approach: The paper makes use of data from the Six-Country Survey on Covid-19 to establish the existence of an income effect on health utilisation, and from the Oxford Covid-19 Government response tracker to show that this income effect is associated with the stringency of governmental response to the pandemic. Data from the 2011/12 “Health and Healthcare” round of the International Social Survey Programme is used to show that this income effect cannot be explained by pre-existing patterns. An explanation for the link between government stringency and the income effect is advanced on a theoretical basis. Findings: The authors find in Britain, the US, and – with greater uncertainty – in Japan that individuals who experience potential Covid-19 symptoms are less likely to seek medical treatment if they have a lower income. The authors also show that governments in these countries adopted a less stringent response to the pandemic than the countries in our sample which do not exhibit an income effect – China, Italy and South Korea. The authors argue that laissez-faire policies place the burden of action upon the individual, activating underlying differences in agency between the social classes, and making (high) low-income individuals (more) less likely to seek medical attention. Research limitations/implications: Since there was not a direct measure of agency in the data, it could not be empirically verified that agency mediates the effect of government stringency on health utilisation. Further research could make use of datasets which incorporate such a measure, if they become available. It could also extend the geographical scope of the findings, to see if the income effect manifests in other countries which adopted a laissez-faire response to the pandemic. Practical implications: Governments should intervene more stringently during pandemics to minimise inequality in health outcomes. Originality/value: This paper establishes an association between the stringency of government response to the Covid-19 pandemic and income inequality in health utilisation. This contributes to scholarly and policy debates around health inequality in the area of social epidemiology, and the sociology of inequality more generally. It is also of relevance to the general public, in the context of a deadly pandemic.","Foley, William; Gërxhani, Klarita",Int. J. Sociol. Soc. Policy,213,24

RESEARCH QUESTION: Is portable CXR an effective exclusionary test for future adverse clinical outcomes in patients suspected of having COVID-19? STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Charts of consecutive patients suspected of having COVID-19 at five EDs in New York City between March 19, 2020, and April 23, 2020, were reviewed. Patients were categorized based on absence of findings on initial CXR. The primary outcomes were hospital admission, mechanical ventilation, ARDS, and mortality. RESULTS: Three thousand two hundred forty-five adult patients, 474 (14.6%) with negative initial CXR results, were reviewed. Among all patients, negative initial CXR results were associated with a low probability of future adverse clinical outcomes, with negative likelihood ratios of 0.27 (95% CI, 0.23-0.31) for hospital admission, 0.24 (95% CI, 0.16-0.37) for mechanical ventilation, 0.19 (95% CI, 0.09-0.40) for ARDS, and 0.38 (95% CI, 0.29-0.51) for mortality. Among the subset of 955 patients younger than 65 years and with a duration of symptoms of at least 5 days, no patients with negative CXR results died, and the negative likelihood ratios were 0.17 (95% CI, 0.12-0.25) for hospital admission, 0.09 (95% CI, 0.02-0.36) for mechanical ventilation, and 0.09 (95% CI, 0.01-0.64) for ARDS. INTERPRETATION: Initial CXR in adult patients suspected of having COVID-19 is a strong exclusionary test for hospital admission, mechanical ventilation, ARDS, and mortality. The value of CXR as an exclusionary test for adverse clinical outcomes is highest among young adults, patients with few comorbidities, and those with a prolonged duration of symptoms.","Pagano, Andrew; Finkelstein, Mark; Overbey, Jessica; Steinberger, Sharon; Ellison, Trevor; Manna, Sayan; Toussie, Danielle; Cedillo, Mario; Jacobi, Adam; Gupta, Yogesh S; Bernheim, Adam; Chung, Michael; Eber, Corey; Fayad, Zahi A; Concepcion, Jose",Chest,213,16

Moreover, given that conspiracy beliefs are stigmatized (i.e., not socially acceptable), we propose that they should be endorsed only when other compensatory systems are frustrated. We test these ideas in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. Participants from North Macedonia and New Zealand, who differed in perceived government effectiveness, filled in a questionnaire measuring domain-specific and domain-general perceived control, as well as domain-specific and domain-general conspiracy beliefs. As expected, domain specificity of the control threat predicted domain-specific conspiracy beliefs in the Macedonian group only.

The digital close-range photogrammetry is used to obtain monitoring data. The error compensation method is used to optimize the center of the monitoring point. Aiming at the limitations of back propagation neural network (BPNN), a genetic algorithm (GA)-optimized BPNN algorithm is proposed. Then, the optimized algorithm is applied to predict the deformation and displacement of foundation pits from three aspects, i.e., simple horizontal displacement, simple longitudinal displacement, and the combination of horizontal and longitudinal displacements. Meanwhile, the time domain, space domain, and time-space domain are used as input features to compare the prediction results of the BPNN model and the GA-optimized BPNN model. Finally, the GA-improved BPNN is compared with the Support Vector Regression (SVR) model and Random Forest (RF) model. The results show that the prediction result, obtained by simultaneously using horizontal displacement and longitudinal displacement as input features, has smaller errors; also, the actual output is closer to the expected output. Compared with the prediction result with time domain and space domain as input features, the prediction result with time-space domain as input features is closer to the expected output. Taking the combination of time and space domains as input features, compared with the BPNN model, the GA-optimized BPNN model has a lower Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) value (0.0163), a larger Index of Agreement (IA) value (0.9800), and a shorter training time (7.08 s). Compared with the SVR model and RF model, the GA-improved BPNN model has a lower Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) value (0.0211), a larger Index of Agreement (IA) value (0.9706), and shorter training time (7.61 s). Therefore, the foundation pit deformation prediction model based on BPNN and GA has strong prediction ability, which can be popularized and applied in similar geotechnical engineering.","Luo, Jie; Ren, Ran; Guo, Kangde",PLoS One,213,26

It is considered a challenging problem due to existing similar image densities in the pulmonary structures, different types of scanners, and scanning protocols. Most of the current semi-automatic segmentation methods rely on human factors therefore it might suffer from lack of accuracy. Another shortcoming of these methods is their high false-positive rate. In recent years, several approaches, based on a deep learning framework, have been effectively applied in medical image segmentation. Among existing deep neural networks, the U-Net has provided great success in this field. In this paper, we propose a deep neural network architecture to perform an automatic lung CT image segmentation process. In the proposed method, several extensive preprocessing techniques are applied to raw CT images. Then, ground truths corresponding to these images are extracted via some morphological operations and manual reforms. Finally, all the prepared images with the corresponding ground truth are fed into a modified U-Net in which the encoder is replaced with a pre-trained ResNet-34 network (referred to as Res BCDU-Net). In the architecture, we employ BConvLSTM (Bidirectional Convolutional Long Short-term Memory)as an advanced integrator module instead of simple traditional concatenators. This is to merge the extracted feature maps of the corresponding contracting path into the previous expansion of the up-convolutional layer. Finally, a densely connected convolutional layer is utilized for the contracting path. The results of our extensive experiments on lung CT images (LIDC-IDRI database) confirm the effectiveness of the proposed method where a dice coefficient index of 97.31% is achieved.","Jalali, Yeganeh; Fateh, Mansoor; Rezvani, Mohsen; Abolghasemi, Vahid; Anisi, Mohammad Hossein",Sensors (Basel),213,16

Circular RNA HIPK3 (CircHIPK3) is reported to be abnormally expressed in various disease tissues and affects the occurrence and development of the disease. However, the role and underlying mechanism of CircRNA HIPK3 in osteoarthritis are still unclear. The purpose of this study is to explore the effect of CircRNA HIPK3 on osteoarthritis and analyze its regulatory mechanism. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We took human OA tissues, normal knee cartilage, human OA chondrocytes and normal chondrocytes as the research objects. Real Time-quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-qPCR) was used to detect CircHIPK3 expression level, its target gene miRNA 124 (miR-124) and downstream target molecule SOX8. Flow cytometry analysis was applied to discover the apoptosis of CircHIPK3 and miR-124 on OA cartilage in different transfection situations. Moreover, Western blot and RT-qPCR were used to detect the expression of caspase-3 in OA chondrocytes. The binding site of CircRNA HIPK3 and miR-124, miR-124, and SOX8 were verified by using Dual-Luciferase assay. RESULTS: High expressed CircHIPK3 and low expressed miR-124 were found in OA tissues and OA chondrocytes. In addition, the Dual-Luciferase report showed CircHIPK3 acted as a sponge of miR-124 in OA chondrocytes. CircHIPK3 and miR-124 expression in OA tissue were confirmed to be negatively correlated. To our surprise, knocking down CircHIPK3 and transfected miR-124 mimics both inhibited the apoptosis of OA chondrocytes. Further experiments verified that the downstream target molecule of miR-124 was SOX8 in OA chondrocytes. Besides, miR-124 inhibitors reversed the knockdown of CircHIPK3 while si-SOX8 reversed the miR-124 inhibitors effect of apoptosis on OA chondrocytes. CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrated that CircHIPK3 was significantly upregulated in OA cartilage tissue and cells. Low expression of CircHIPK3 promoted the apoptosis of OA chondrocytes by promoting miR-124 to suppress SOX8 expression. The molecular mechanism of CircHIPK3 in present study is expected to provide new ideas for the treatment of osteoarthritis.","Wu, Q; Yuan, Z-H; Ma, X-B; Tang, X-H",Eur Rev Med Pharmacol Sci,213,24

Understanding the impact of COVID-19 on pregnancy in terms of morbidity, mortality, and perinatal maternal and fetal outcomes is essential to propose strategies for prevention and infection control. Here, we conducted a systematic review to investigate pregnant women infected with COVID-19 in terms of signs and symptoms, type of delivery, comorbidities, maternal and neonatal outcomes, and the possibility of vertical transmission. A search on Embase and PubMed databases was performed on 31 October 2020. Observational studies and case reports on pregnant women infected with COVID-19 were included without language restrictions. The 70 selected studies included a total of 1457 pregnant women diagnosed with COVID-19 in the first, second, and third trimesters of pregnancy. The most common signs and symptoms were fever, cough, and nausea. The most frequent comorbidities were obesity, hypertensive disorders, and gestational diabetes. Among maternal and fetal outcomes, premature birth (n = 64), maternal death (n = 15), intrauterine fetal death or neonatal death (n = 16), cases of intrauterine fetal distress (n = 28), miscarriage (n = 7), decreased fetal movements (n = 19), and severe neonatal asphyxia (n = 5) were the most frequent. Thirty-nine newborns tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Additionally, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) RNA was detected in the placenta (n = 13) and breast milk (n = 6). This review indicates that COVID-19 during pregnancy can result in maternal, fetal, and neonatal complications. In addition, SARS-CoV-2 viral exposure of neonates during pregnancy and delivery cannot be ruled out. Thus, we highlight the need for long-term follow-up of newborns from mothers diagnosed with COVID-19 to establish the full implications of SARS-CoV-2 infection in these children.","Amaral, Waldemar Naves do; Moraes, Carolina Leão de; Rodrigues, Ana Paula Dos Santos; Noll, Matias; Arruda, Jalsi Tacon; Mendonça, Carolina Rodrigues",,213,23

As a collaborative and self-guided, inquiry-based learning method, it focuses on learners' intrinsic motivation while working on real world problems organised in projects (Challenges in CBL) with an experiential and progressive approach to apply acquired knowledge in real world scenarios, ideate solution concepts and build innovative digital products. To overcome limitations of spiral curriculum or elaboration theory, the authors applied narrative theory to design the program's educational experience for the academic year 2019/2020 as a cohesive journey within a communal learning environment with a coherent and connected structure of narratively driven learning Challenges. The authors present concepts to develop their approach further towards an emergent narrative experience design system to manage the educational journey as it develops, rather than scripting it. This paper evolves the authors' Narrative Experience Design Canvas to model educational experience design that encourages unscripted, emergent narratives for experiential education with the goal of fostering learners' engagement, agency and creativity. Derived in part by models developed for digital interactive storytelling or educational video games, it categorises the components for designing an educational experience that allows the learning progression to be driven by learners as co-authors and describes mechanisms that allow unscripted narratives to emerge based on intrinsic motivation. Additionally, the authors present considerations for synchronous and asynchronous learning to evolve their framework for application in blended or remote learning scenarios. Drawing upon findings for remote learning and experiential e-learning - ee-learning - presented by scholars as well as implications identified during the COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting switch to remote learning within the program at University of Naples Federico II in 2020, it is shown how combining narrative elements with experiential e-learning principles can result in increased engagement, motivation and sense of community in learners. Using the example of an individual learning unit - a Challenge - considerations from overall course design down to day-to-day learning activities within the course are presented. For the future, the authors indicate action points to develop this model into an Emergent Narrative System for designing narratively driven and experiential software development education programs and indicate areas of further research on learning activity design for blended or remote learning experiences.","Recke, M.

The prevalence was lower in female than in male (9.66% vs. 10.11%) and the prevalence was higher for junior high school students than senior high school students (13.89% vs. 12.93%). The prevalence of anxiety symptoms was highest among rural students and lowest among urban students (11.33% vs. 8.77%). The cognitive level was negatively associated with the prevalence of anxiety symptoms. After adjusting for potential confounders, age, gender, residential location, worried level, fear level and behavior status were found to be associated with anxiety symptoms. LIMITATIONS: Prevalence may be skewed by assessing anxiety symptoms using self-reported scales rather than clinical interviews. CONCLUSIONS: This large-scale study assesses the prevalence of anxiety symptoms and its potential influencing factors in junior and senior high school students. These findings suggest that governments need to pay more attention to the mental health of young people in combating COVID-19.","Xu, Qingqing; Mao, Zhenxing; Wei, Dandan; Liu, Pengling; Fan, Keliang; Wang, Juan; Wang, Xian; Lou, Xiaomin; Lin, Hualiang; Wang, Chongjian; Wu, Cuiping",J Affect Disord,213,1

To prevent the rapid spread of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and treat patients with mild symptoms, sports stadiums and convention centers were reconstructed into mobile hospitals. RESEARCH QUESTION: It is unknown whether a mobile cabin hospital can provide a safe treatment site for patients with mild COVID-19 symptoms. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: This study retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 421 patients with COVID-19 admitted to a mobile cabin hospital in Wuhan from February 9, 2020, to March 5, 2020. Clinical data comprised patient age, sex, clinical presentation, chest imaging, nucleic acid testing, length of hospitalization, and outcomes. RESULTS: Of the patients who were discharged from the cabin hospital, 362 (86.0%) were categorized as recovered; 14.0% developed severe symptoms and were transferred to a designated hospital. The most common presenting symptoms were fever (60.6%) and cough (52.0%); 5.2% exhibited no obvious symptoms. High fever (> 39.0°C) was more common in severe cases than in recovered cases (18.6% vs 6.6%). The distribution of lung lesions was peripheral in 85.0% of patients, multifocal in 69.4%, and bilateral in 68.2%. The most common pattern was ground-glass opacity (67.7%), followed by patchy shadowing (49.2%). The incidence of patchy shadowing was higher in patients with severe disease (66.1%) than in those who recovered (31.8%, P < .0001). The median length of hospitalization was 17 days (interquartile range, 14-19 days), and the median time taken for positive real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction results to become negative in recovered patients was 8 days (interquartile range, 6-10 days). INTERPRETATION: Mobile cabin hospitals provide a safe treatment site for patients with mild COVID-19 symptoms and offer an effective isolation area to prevent the spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2.","Xiong, Zhongwei; Xin, Can; Yan, Xixi; Cai, Yuankun; Zhou, Keyao; Xie, Chuanshun; Zhang, Tingbao; Wu, Xiaohui; Liu, Kui; Li, Zhiqiang; Wang, Wei; Chen, Jincao",Chest,213,16

However, network information generally is available only up to some level of error. We study the propagation of such errors to estimators of average causal effects under network interference. Specifically, assuming a four-level exposure model and Bernoulli random assignment of treatment, we characterize the impact of network noise on the bias and variance of standard estimators in homogeneous and inhomogeneous networks. In addition, we propose method-of-moments estimators for bias reduction. We illustrate the practical performance of our estimators through simulation studies in British secondary school contact networks.","Li, Wenrui; Sussman, Daniel L.; Kolaczyk, Eric D.",,213,24

Whether vitamin D3 supplementation reduces severe childhood asthma exacerbations is unclear. Objective: To determine whether vitamin D3 supplementation improves the time to a severe exacerbation in children with asthma and low vitamin D levels. Design, Setting, and Participants: The Vitamin D to Prevent Severe Asthma Exacerbations (VDKA) Study was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial of vitamin D3 supplementation to improve the time to severe exacerbations in high-risk children with asthma aged 6 to 16 years taking low-dose inhaled corticosteroids and with serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels less than 30 ng/mL. Participants were recruited from 7 US centers. Enrollment started in February 2016, with a goal of 400 participants; the trial was terminated early (March 2019) due to futility, and follow-up ended in September 2019. Interventions: Participants were randomized to vitamin D3, 4000 IU/d (n = 96), or placebo (n = 96) for 48 weeks and maintained with fluticasone propionate, 176 µg/d (6-11 years old), or 220 µg/d (12-16 years old). Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was the time to a severe asthma exacerbation. Secondary outcomes included the time to a viral-induced severe exacerbation, the proportion of participants in whom the dose of inhaled corticosteroid was reduced halfway through the trial, and the cumulative fluticasone dose during the trial. Results: Among 192 randomized participants (mean age, 9.8 years; 77 girls [40%]), 180 (93.8%) completed the trial. A total of 36 participants (37.5%) in the vitamin D3 group and 33 (34.4%) in the placebo group had 1 or more severe exacerbations. Compared with placebo, vitamin D3 supplementation did not significantly improve the time to a severe exacerbation: the mean time to exacerbation was 240 days in the vitamin D3 group vs 253 days in the placebo group (mean group difference, -13.1 days [95% CI, -42.6 to 16.4]; adjusted hazard ratio, 1.13 [95% CI, 0.69 to 1.85]; P = .63). Vitamin D3 supplementation, compared with placebo, likewise did not significantly improve the time to a viral-induced severe exacerbation, the proportion of participants whose dose of inhaled corticosteroid was reduced, or the cumulative fluticasone dose during the trial. Serious adverse events were similar in both groups (vitamin D3 group, n = 11; placebo group, n = 9). Conclusions and Relevance: Among children with persistent asthma and low vitamin D levels, vitamin D3 supplementation, compared with placebo, did not significantly improve the time to a severe asthma exacerbation. The findings do not support the use of vitamin D3 supplementation to prevent severe asthma exacerbations in this group of patients.

METHODS: This study included healthcare personnel that showed symptoms or were in contact with a coronavirus disease 2019 case patient from March 2, 2020 to April 19, 2020. Their evolution and characteristics (age, sex, professional category, type of contact) were recorded. Correlations between the different characteristics and risk of developing coronavirus disease 2019 and severe coronavirus disease 2019 were analyzed using chi-square tests. Their magnitudes were quantified with ORs, AORs, and their 95% CIs using a logistic regression model. RESULTS: Of the 3,900 healthcare professionals in the department, 1,791 (45.9%) showed symptoms or were part of a contact tracing study. The prevalence of those with symptoms was 20.1% (784/3,900; 95% CI=18.8, 21.4), with coronavirus disease 2019 was 4.0% (156/3,900; 95% CI=3.4, 4.6), and with severe coronavirus disease 2019 was 0.5% (18/3,900; 95% CI=0.2, 0.7). The frequency of coronavirus disease 2019 in symptomatic healthcare personnel with a nonprotected exposure was 22.8% (112/491) and 13.7% (40/293) in those with a protected exposure (AOR=2.2, 95% CI=1.2, 3.9). The service in which the healthcare personnel performed their activity was not significantly associated with being diagnosed with coronavirus disease 2019. A total of 26.3% (10/38) of male healthcare personnel with coronavirus disease 2019 required hospitalization, compared with 6.8% (8/118) among female healthcare personnel (OR=4.9, 95% CI=1.8, 13.6). CONCLUSIONS: A surveillance and monitoring program centred on healthcare personnel enables an understanding of the risk factors that lead to coronavirus disease 2019 among this population. This knowledge allows the refinement of the strategies for disease control and prevention in healthcare personnel during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic.","Algado-Sellés, Natividad; Gras-Valentí, Paula; Chico-Sánchez, Pablo; Mora-Muriel, Juan G; Soler-Molina, Victor M; Hernández-Maldonado, María; Lameiras-Azevedo, Ana-Sofía; Jiménez-Sepúlveda, Natali J; Gómez-Sotero, Isel-Lilibeth; Villanueva-Ruiz, Cesar O; Barrenengoa-Sañudo, Julio; Fuster-Pérez, Marina; Cánovas-Javega, Sandra; Cerezo-Milan, Patricia; Monerris-Palmer, Miranda; Esclapez, Ana; Cartagena-Llopis, Lidia; García-Rivera, Claudia; Martínez-Tornero, Iluminada; Nadal-Morante, Verónica; Merino-Lucas, Esperanza; Rodriguez-Diaz, Juan C; Vidal-Catala, Inmaculada; Llorens-Soriano, Pere; San Inocencio, David; Gil-Carbonell, Joan; Montiel-Higuero, Inés; Sánchez-Vela, Pablo; Sánchez-Payá, José",Am J Prev Med,213,13

This article focuses on the political economy of higher education (HE) digitalisation and suggests a new research programme. I foreground three principal arguments, which are empirically, theoretically, and politically crucial for HE scholars. First, most literature is examining the impacts of digitalisation on the HE sector and its subjects alone. I argue that current changes in digitalising HE cannot be studied in isolation from broader changes in the global economy. Specifically, HE digitalisation is embedded in the expansion of the digital economy, which is marked by new forms of value extraction and rentiership. Second, the emerging research on the intersection of marketisation and digitalisation in HE seems to follow the theories of marketisation qua production and commodification. I argue that we need theories with better explanatory power in analysing the current digitalisation dynamics. I propose to move from commodification to assetisation, and from prices to rents. Finally, universities are digitalising in the time when the practice is superseding policy, and there is no regulation beyond the question of data privacy. However, digital data property is already a reality, governed by 'terms of use', and protected by the intellectual property rights regime. The current pandemic has led to 'emergency pedagogy', which has intensified overall digitalisation in the sector and is bypassing concerns of data value redistribution. I argue that we urgently need public scrutiny and political action to address issues of value extraction and redistribution in HE.","Komljenovic, Janja",High Educ (Dordr),213,21

This study investigated ETC experiences and critical care policies for patients with viral hemorrhagic fever (VHF). DESIGN: A 58-item questionnaire elicited information on policies for 9 critical care interventions, factors that limited care provision, and innovations developed to deliver care. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: The questionnaire was sent to 82 ETCs. METHODS: We analyzed ordinal and categorical data pertaining to the ETC characteristics and descriptive data about their policies and perceived challenges. Statistical analyses assessed whether ETCs with experience caring for VHF patients were more likely to have critical care policies than those that did not. RESULTS: Of the 27 ETCs who responded, 17 (63%) were included. Among them, 8 (47%) reported experience caring for persons under investigation or confirmed cases of VHF. Most felt ready to provide intubation, chest compressions, and renal replacement therapy to these patients. The factors most cited for limiting care were staff safety and clinical futility. Innovations developed to better provide care included increased simulation training and alternative technologies for procedures and communication. CONCLUSIONS: There were broad similarities in critical care policies and limitations among institutions. There were several interventions, namely ECMO and cricothyrotomy, which few institutions felt ready to provide. Future studies could identify obstacles to providing these interventions and explore policy changes after increased experience with novel infectious diseases, such as COVID-19.","DiLorenzo, Madeline A; Baker, Christoph A; Herstein, Jocelyn J; Evans, Laura; Lowe, John J; Gibbs, Shawn G; Bhadelia, Nahid",Infect Control Hosp Epidemiol,213,20

Human coronaviruses (CoVs) are a major cause of respiratory and gastrointestinal tract infections with associated morbidity and mortality. OBJECTIVES: The objective of our study was to characterize the epidemiology of CoVs in our tertiary care centre, and identify clinical correlates of disease severity. STUDY DESIGN: A cross-sectional study was performed of 226 patients admitted with confirmed CoV respiratory tract infection between 2010 and 2016. Variables consistent with a severe disease burden were evaluated including symptoms, length of stay, intensive care unit (ICU) admission and mortality. RESULTS: CoVs represented 11.3% of all positive respiratory virus samples and OC43 was the most commonly identified CoV. The majority of infections were community-associated while 21.6% were considered nosocomial. The average length of stay was 11.8 days with 17.3% of patients requiring ICU admission and an all-cause mortality of 7%. In a multivariate model, female gender and smoking were associated with increased likelihood of admission to ICU or death. CONCLUSION: This study highlights the significant burden of CoVs and justifies the need for surveillance in the acute care setting.","Kozak, Robert; Prost, Karren; Yip, Lily; Williams, Victoria; Leis, Jerome A; Mubareka, Samira",J Clin Virol,213,16

In this study, we aimed to evaluate serum antibody responses in patients regardless of the outcome. We measured the circulating immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibody levels in 60 subjects with a certified history of SARS-CoV-2 infection by using immunoenzymatic, chemiluminescent, and Neutralization assays. Half patients had a severe infection, the other half were pauci-symptomatic. We analyzed their antibody response to see the trend of the humoral response. Our results showed a significant difference in circulating IgG level among the two groups. The neutralizing antibody response against SARS-CoV-2 was significantly higher among those who had severe disease. Furthermore, ten subjects from each group were screened twice, and a declining antibody trend was observed in pauci-symptomatic individuals. These findings provide evidence that humoral immunity against SARS-CoV-2 in pauci-symptomatic people is weak and may not be long-lasting. This may have implications for immunity strategy and prevention, since it is still not clear whether a time-dependent decrease of both circulating and neutralizing antibodies to nonprotective levels could occur in a longer time span and whether potential vaccines are able to induce a herd immunity and a durable response.","Anichini, Gabriele; Gandolfo, Claudia; Terrosi, Chiara; Fabrizi, Simonetta; Miceli, Giovanni Battista; Gori Savellini, Gianni; Prathyumnan, Shibily; Franchi, Federico; Cusi, Maria Grazia",J Med Virol,213,5

Nasopharyngeal swabs and real-time RT-PCR are used for the detection of the viral RNA. The collection of saliva is non-invasive, pain-free and does not require trained personnel. An alternative to RT-PCR is loop-mediated isothermal amplification coupled with reverse transcription (RT-LAMP) that is easy to perform, quick and does not require a thermal cycler. The aim of this study was to test whether SARS-CoV-2 RNA can be detected directly in saliva using RT-LAMP. We have tested 16 primer mixes from the available literature in three rounds of sensitivity assays. The selected RT-LAMP primer mix has a limit of detection of 6 copies of viral RNA per reaction in comparison with RT-PCR with 1 copy per reaction. Whole saliva, as well as saliva collected using Salivette collection tubes, interfered with the RT-LAMP analysis. Neither Chelex-100 nor protease treatment of saliva prevented the inhibitory effect of saliva. With the addition of the ribonuclease inhibitor, the sensitivity of the RT-LAMP assay was 12 copies per reaction of RNA in Salivette® saliva samples and 6 copies per reaction of RNA in whole saliva samples. This study shows that it is possible to combine the use of saliva and RT-LAMP for SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection without RNA extraction which was confirmed on a small set of correctly diagnosed clinical samples.

It is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), a novel virus that is easily transmitted from human to human through the respiratory route. Usually, it presents with fever, headache, fatigue accompanied by respiratory symptoms like cough and dyspnea, and other systemic involvements. Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is a common lymphoproliferative neoplasm characterized by absolute lymphocytosis and demonstration of clonality unlike other causes of lymphocytosis. Patients with CLL are considered immunocompromised because of impaired humoral immunity (mainly) and cellular immunity. Therefore, they are vulnerable to various infections including COVID-19. Little is known about the COVID-19 infection when it unmasks CLL. CASE REPORT A 49-year-old man with no significant previous illnesses, and an unremarkable family history, presented with a moderate COVID-19 infection. He initially presented to the emergency department with fever and mild shortness of breath. A complete blood count showed a high white blood cell count with absolute lymphocytosis. Flow cytometry revealed the clonality of the lymphocytes confirming the diagnosis of CLL. Despite having CLL, he developed a moderate COVID-19 infection and recovered in a few days. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of CLL, which presented with a COVID-19 infection as the initial presentation. CONCLUSIONS Lymphocytosis is an unexpected finding in patients diagnosed with COVID-19 infection and the elevated lymphocytes may be indicative of other conditions. Secondary causes of lymphocytosis like malignancy or other infections should be considered in these cases.","Ali, Elrazi; Badawi, Mohamed; Abdelmahmuod, Elabbass; Kohla, Samah; Yassin, Mohamed A",Am J Case Rep,213,24

In many adaptive designs, the conventional end-of-trial point estimates of the treatment effects are prone to bias, because they do not take into account the potential and realised trial adaptations. While much of the methodological developments on adaptive designs have tended to focus on control of type I error rates and power considerations, in contrast the question of biased estimation has received less attention. This article addresses this issue by providing a comprehensive overview of proposed approaches to remove or reduce the potential bias in point estimation of treatment effects in an adaptive design, as well as illustrating how to implement them. We first discuss how bias can affect standard estimators and critically assess the negative impact this can have. We then describe and compare proposed unbiased and bias-adjusted estimators of treatment effects for different types of adaptive designs. Furthermore, we illustrate the computation of different estimators in practice using a real trial example. Finally, we propose a set of guidelines for researchers around the choice of estimators and the reporting of estimates following an adaptive design.","Robertson, David S.; Choodari-Oskooei, Babak; Dimairo, Munya; Flight, Laura; Pallmann, Philip; Jaki, Thomas",,213,16

The severity of COVID-19 may be influenced by a counterbalance between the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) and angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). SARS-CoV2 cleaves with ACE2 and enters cells leaving an unopposed effect of ACE in the lungs. Both 2D:4D and the ACE I/D polymorphism are covariates of oxygen metabolism. COVID-19 leads to lung damage and a reduction in oxygen saturation of the blood. Here, we examine the interrelationships between 2D:4D, ACE polymorphism, and COVID-19 CFR. METHODS: National frequencies/rates were obtained for 2D:4D from the BBC Internet study (n = 41), published values of ACE I/II (n = 39), and COVID-19 CFR from three World Health Organization situation reports (n = 41). RESULTS: 2D:4D was negatively associated with national ACE I/II frequencies. However, there was a positive relationship between male 2D:4D and CFR (right and left 2D:4D, two, and three situation reports respectively). The relationships between ACE I/II and CFR were non-significant. Relationships between male 2D:4D and CFR's were independent of female 2D:4D and ACE I/II. CONCLUSIONS: The ACE I/D polymorphism may influence 2D:4D such that ACE II individuals have lower 2D:4D than ACE DD individuals. Low 2D:4D and ACE II individuals show efficient oxygen metabolism. Therefore, low 2D:4D and ACE II together may protect against COVID-19 severity. The sex-dependent positive correlation between male 2D:4D and CFR is independent of ACE I/II, suggesting that the sex-dependent variation in the ACE2 gene may also influence the 2D:4D phenotype.","Manning, John T; Fink, Bernhard",Early Hum Dev,213,21

BACKGROUND: Following the outbreak of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic, a drop in blood donation has been observed. It is crucial to determine the actual number of potential SARS-CoV-2-positive donors to define the measures and ensure adequate blood supply. METHODS: The cumulative incidence of SARS-CoV-2 positivity, calculated on the general population, was applied to the donor population by estimating the number of positive subjects. The calculation model was validated by the linear interpolation method. The number of blood units actually discarded based on post-donation information was also taken into account. RESULTS: Three months after the outbreak, 5322 donors were estimated to be positive for SARS-CoV-2 and were therefore potentially excluded from donation. A total of units of blood components were discarded following post donation information. The estimated number of donors deceased (180) and the number of clinically recovered individuals in the same period was also considered. CONCLUSION: This forecasting model can be used to obtain information on blood donors' involvement during future SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks, especially in case of changes concerning epidemiology, incidence by age bracket and geographical distribution and also for new outbreaks of emerging viruses.","Pati, Ilaria; Velati, Claudio; Mengoli, Carlo; Franchini, Massimo; Masiello, Francesca; Marano, Giuseppe; Veropalumbo, Eva; Vaglio, Stefania; Piccinini, Vanessa; Pupella, Simonetta; Liumbruno, Giancarlo M",Transfus. med,213,32

Non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) and travel restrictions for controlling COVID-19 have impacted the circulation of most respiratory viruses including RSV globally, particularly in Australia, where during 2020 the normal winter epidemics were notably absent3-6. However, in late 2020, unprecedented widespread RSV outbreaks occurred, beginning in spring, and extending into summer across two widely separated states of Australia, Western Australia (WA) and New South Wales (NSW) including the Australian Capital Territory (ACT). Genome sequencing revealed a significant reduction in RSV genetic diversity following COVID-19 emergence except for two genetically distinct RSV-A clades. These clades circulated cryptically, likely localized for several months prior to an epidemic surge in cases upon relaxation of COVID-19 control measures. The NSW/ACT clade subsequently spread to the neighbouring state of Victoria (VIC) and caused extensive outbreaks and hospitalisations in early 2021.

It utilizes sequential patterns and enables concise record representation while using but a minimal amount of historical data. The quantitative results of our statistical analytics indicated critical patterns reflecting on many of the expected collective behavior and their associated outcomes.

Methods: Analysis from medical records of COVID-19 patients in a Brazilian center. Results: A total of 95 patients were analyzed. There was male predominance (64.2%), median age: 64.9 years, and previous history of hypertension and diabetes in 51.6 and 27.4%, respectively. AKI was diagnosed in 54 (56.8%) patients, and 32 (59.2%) of them required HD. Mortality rate was 17.9%. AKI patients when compared with no-AKI were more frequently hypertensive/diabetic and more often needed organ support therapies.

DESIGN: We conducted an international prospective study across Europe on liver transplant recipients with SARS-CoV-2 infection confirmed by microbiological assay during the first outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic. Baseline characteristics, clinical presentation, management of immunosuppressive therapy and outcomes were collected. RESULTS: 57 patients were included (70% male, median (IQR) age at diagnosis 65 (57-70) years). 21 (37%), 32 (56%) and 21 (37%) patients had one cardiovascular disease, arterial hypertension and diabetes mellitus, respectively. The most common symptoms were fever (79%), cough (55%), dyspnoea (46%), fatigue or myalgia (56%) and GI symptoms (33%). Immunosuppression was reduced in 22 recipients (37%) and discontinued in 4 (7%). With this regard, no impact on outcome was observed.

In low-income and middle-income countries,during the next decade, the incidence of cancer is expected to almost double.In 2018 India had about 1.16 million cancer cases, 784800 cancer deaths amongits population of 1.35 billion people. Furthermore, the treatment cost for more than 40% of cancer hospitalization is made by selling the assets and borrowing from relatives;they incur out-of-pocket (OOPE) expenditure in the private sector and can cost more than 20 percent of their annual per capita household spending.And over 76% of cancer patient families faced financial problems during treatment. The main aim objective of the study was to understand the cancer scenario in India, its treatment cost implications and various treatment facilities and different funding assistance cum Health schemes implemented by central and state governments in India.The data is collected from secondary sources and descriptive study was performed. Therefore in conclusion we find that, we require effective prevention for surviving against cancer along with the proper awareness of the funding schemes by the government for the cancer patients and greater investment in the healthcare infrastructure needs proper attention.","Khare, S.; Raychaudhuri, P.

The impact of neoadjuvant hormone monotherapy in deferral of surgery during the SARS-COV-2 pandemic,12.672647,8.940363,2021,"BACKGROUND: In a variable number of Covid-19 patients with acute respiratory failure, non-invasive breathing support strategies cannot provide adequate oxygenation, thus making invasive mechanical ventilation necessary. Factors predicting this unfavorable outcome are unknown, but we hypothesized that diaphragmatic weakness may contribute. METHODS: We prospectively analyzed the data of 27 consecutive patients admitted to the general Intensive Care Unit (ICU) from March 19, 2020, to April 20, 2020 and submitted to continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) before considering invasive ventilation. Diaphragmatic thickening fraction (DTF) inferred by ultrasound was determined before applying CPAP. RESULTS: Eighteen patients recovered with CPAP, whereas nine required invasive mechanical ventilation with longer stay in ICU (p < 0.001) and hospital (p = 0.003). At univariate logistic regression analysis, CPAP failure was significantly associated with low DTF [ß: -0.396; OR: 0.673; p < 0.001] and high respiratory rate [ß: 0.452; OR: 1.572; p < 0.001] but only DTF reached statistical significance at multivariate analysis [ß: -0.384; OR: 0.681; p < 0.001]. The DTF best threshold predicting CPAP failure was 21.4 % (AUC: 0.944; sensitivity: 94.4 %, specificity: 88.9 %). CONCLUSIONS: In critically ill patients with Covid-19 respiratory failure admitted to ICU, a reduced DTF could be a potential predictor of CPAP failure and requirement of invasive ventilation.","Corradi, Francesco; Vetrugno, Luigi; Orso, Daniele; Bove, Tiziana; Schreiber, Annia; Boero, Enrico; Santori, Gregorio; Isirdi, Alessandro; Barbieri, Greta; Forfori, Francesco",Respir Physiol Neurobiol,213,10

Neuroscience and psychology agree that dreaming helps people to cope with negative emotions and to learn from experience, but can dreaming effectively reveal mental suffering and changes in social behavior? To address this question, we applied natural language processing tools to study 239 dream reports by 67 individuals, made either before the Covid-19 outbreak or during the months of March and April, 2020, when lockdown was imposed in Brazil following the WHO's declaration of the pandemic. Pandemic dreams showed a higher proportion of anger and sadness words, and higher average semantic similarities to the terms ""contamination"" and ""cleanness"". These features seem to be associated with mental suffering linked to social isolation, as they explained 40% of the variance in the PANSS negative subscale related to socialization (p = 0.0088). These results corroborate the hypothesis that pandemic dreams reflect mental suffering, fear of contagion, and important changes in daily habits that directly impact socialization.","Mota, Natália Bezerra; Weissheimer, Janaina; Ribeiro, Marina; de Paiva, Mizziara; Avilla-Souza, Juliana; Simabucuru, Gabriela; Chaves, Monica Frias; Cecchi, Lucas; Cirne, Jaime; Cecchi, Guillermo; Rodrigues, Cilene; Copelli, Mauro; Ribeiro, Sidarta",PLoS One,213,24

How the virus evades host defense for efficient replication is not fully understood. In this report, we found that the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein (NP) impaired stress granule (SG) formation induced by viral RNA. SARS-CoV-2 NP associated with the protein kinase PKR after dsRNA stimulation. SARS-CoV-2 NP did not affect dsRNA-induced PKR oligomerization, but impaired dsRNA-induced PKR phosphorylation (a hallmark of its activation) as well as SG formation. SARS-CoV-2 NP also targeted the SG-nucleating protein G3BP1 and impaired G3BP1-mediated SG formation. Deficiency of PKR or G3BP1 impaired dsRNA-triggered SG formation and increased SARS-CoV-2 replication. The NP of SARS-CoV also targeted both PKR and G3BP1 to impair dsRNA-induced SG formation, whereas the NP of MERS-CoV targeted PKR, but not G3BP1 for the impairment. Our findings suggest that SARS-CoV-2 NP promotes viral replication by impairing formation of antiviral SGs, and reveal a conserved mechanism on evasion of host antiviral responses by highly pathogenic human betacoronaviruses.","Zheng, Z.

Studies reporting technical aspects of component of PPE including mask and respirator, gown and coverall, gloves, goggles, face shields or visors, and boots, are included in this review. Expert commentary: The design and materials of PPE needs further research, which might have minimal carriage of infective biological load like use of antimicrobial repellent finishes along with adequate tensile strength and breathability through the fabric. Respirators should have least resistance while providing maximum protection; goggles should not have fogging. Also, there is need of formulating universal technical specifications for medically used PPE, and ensuring easy availability of testing facility.","Saran, Sai; Gurjar, Mohan; Baronia, Arvind Kumar; Lohiya, Ayush; Azim, Afzal; Poddar, Banani; Rao, Namrata S",Expert rev. med. devices,213,26

It is a multisystemic disease associated with micro- and macrovascular thrombo-embolic complications, including intracardiac thrombosis, which has not been previously reported in the literature. Case summary: We report a case of a 68-year-old woman with COVID-19 admitted to our intensive care unit with acute respiratory distress, undifferentiated shock, hyperkalaemia, acute kidney injury, and coagulopathy. She received crystalloid infusion, broad-spectrum antibiotics, hydroxychloroquine, insulin-dextrose, calcium gluconate, sodium bicarbonate, and i.v. vasopressors. Continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) was started for refractory hyperkalaemia and metabolic acidosis. Transthoracic echocardiogram obtained for concern of pulmonary embolism found bi-atrial thrombosis with normal bi-ventricular dimensions and function. Systemic anticoagulation was provided, but this was stopped soon afterwards due to worsening coagulopathy and bleeding. Despite intensive measures and supportive therapy, the patient developed worsening hypoxia, refractory shock, and multiorgan failure. After discussion of goals of care with her family, a decision was made to initiate hospice care. The patient died within 72 h of hospital admission. Discussion: Infection with SARS-CoV-2 is a multisystemic disease that primarily affects the lungs, but also predisposes to rare thrombo-embolic phenomena such as intracardiac thrombosis. © 2020 The Author(s) 2020.

Coronavirus binding to ACE2 (angiotensin-converting enzyme 2), a crucial component of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, underlies much of this concern. Children are uniquely impacted by the coronavirus, but the reasons are unclear. This review will highlight the relationship of COVID-19 with hypertension, use of ACE inhibitors and Ang II receptor blockers, and lifetime risk of cardiovascular disease from the pediatric perspective. We briefly summarize the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system and comprehensively review the literature pertaining to the ACE 2/Ang-(1-7) pathway in children and the clinical evidence for how ACE inhibitors and Ang II receptor blockers affect this important pathway. Given the importance of the ACE 2/Ang-(1-7) pathway and the potential differences between adults and children, it is crucial that children are included in coronavirus-related research, as this may shed light on potential mechanisms for why children are at decreased risk of severe COVID-19.","South, Andrew M; Brady, Tammy M; Flynn, Joseph T",Hypertension,213,24

The virus requires structural and non-structural proteins for its multiplication that are produced from polyproteins obtained by translation of its genomic RNA. These polyproteins are converted into structural and non-structural proteins mainly by the main protease (Mpro). A systematic screening of a drug library (having drugs and diagnostic agents which are approved by FDA or other world authorities) and the Asinex BioDesign library was carried out using pharmacophore and sequential conformational precision level filters using the Schrodinger Suite. From the screening of approved drug library, three antiviral agents ritonavir, nelfinavir and saquinavir were predicted to be the most potent Mpro inhibitors. Apart from these pralmorelin, iodixanol and iotrolan were also identified from the systematic screening. As iodixanol and iotrolan carry some limitations, structural modifications in them could lead to stable and safer antiviral agents. Screenings of Asinex BioDesign library resulted in 20 molecules exhibiting promising interactions with the target protein Mpro. They can broadly be categorized into four classes based on the nature of the scaffold, viz. disubstituted pyrazoles, cyclic amides, pyrrolidine-based compounds and miscellaneous derivatives. These could be used as potential molecules or hits for further drug development to obtain clinically useful therapeutic agents for the treatment of COVID-19.","Kanhed, Ashish M; Patel, Dushyant V; Teli, Divya M; Patel, Nirav R; Chhabria, Mahesh T; Yadav, Mange Ram",Mol. divers,213,16

The strategies for lacrimal practice were classified into 7 subtypes, and each of the blueprints were reassessed based on existing information on resumption strategies of elective surgeries from other specialties in COVID-19 era. The specific needs of lacrimal practice were then added to construct algorithms summarizing the resumption strategies. The basic principle of 'primum non nocere' needs to be followed. The overall proposed plan advocates the transition to a more sustainable health care reality in a world where we would still co-exist with COVID-19. A comprehensive effort involving screening, laboratory testing, appropriate triage, effective personal protection and specific precautionary measures for lacrimal clinics and operating room are needed to be able to safely resume elective surgery when the pandemic peak declines. To predict the timing of the resumption of elective surgeries is quite complex and influenced by several geographic, political and economic factors. It is equally important to remember that COVID-19 crisis is a dynamic situation and constantly evolving, hence the strategies provided are subject to change. Strict adherence to standard COVID-19 guidelines combined with effective testing and personal protection strategies can ensure slow yet smooth and safe return to full lacrimal practice after the COVID-19 pandemic calms down. The local government directives, individual and institutional discretion are advised.","Ali, Mohammad Javed",Indian J Ophthalmol,213,21

We fit the model to daily data on the number of infected cases in China, Italy, the United States, and Brazil. These four countries can be viewed as representing different stages, from later to earlier, of a COVID-19 epidemic cycle. We solve for a model-implied effective reproduction number R t each day so that the model closely replicates the daily number of currently infected cases in each country. For out-of-sample projections, we fit a behavioral function to the in-sample data that allows for the endogenous response of R t to movements in the lagged number of infected cases. We show that declines in measures of population mobility tend to precede declines in the model-implied reproduction numbers for each country. This pattern suggests that mandatory and voluntary stay-at-home behavior and social distancing during the early stages of the epidemic worked to reduce the effective reproduction number and mitigate the spread of COVID-19.","Buckman, Shelby R; Glick, Reuven; Lansing, Kevin J; Petrosky-Nadeau, Nicolas; Seitelman, Lily M",,213,19

To expedite this process even further, human challenge trials have been proposed by the World Health Organization (WHO) as an alternative to conventional approaches. In such trials, healthy volunteers are deliberately infected with the pathogen of interest, enabling scientists to study the infection process and facilitate further research on treatments or prophylactics, including vaccines. While human challenge trials would offer a collective benefit to society, minimizing the risks is always difficult. Ethical controversy thus inevitably surrounds these trials. Typically, healthy young adults are recruited to serve as the first candidate subjects for human challenge trials because they are generally considered to represent a low-risk population. Here, we present three reasons for doubt about this healthy-young-adults-first criterion and give justification for also recruiting healthy older adults (or not-young adults), meaning those over 30 years of age, to participate in such trials for SARS-CoV-2.","Matsui, Kenji; Inoue, Yusuke; Yamamoto, Keiichiro",Ethics Hum.

SARS-CoV-2, the pathogen of COVID-19, enters into cells through binding to the Angiotensin Converting Enzyme (ACE) homolog-2 (ACE2). ACE2 is a regulator of two contrary pathways in renin angiotensin system (RAS): ACE-Ang-II-AT1R axis and ACE2-Ang 1-7-Mas axis. Viral entry process eventuate in downregulation of ACE2 and subsequent activation of ACE-Ang-II-AT1R axis. ACE-Ang II-AT1R axis increases lipid storage, reduces white-to-beige fat conversion and plays role in obesity. Conversely, adipose tissue is an important source of angiotensin, and obesity results in increased systemic RAS. ACE-Ang-II-AT1R axis, which has proinflammatory, profibrotic, prothrombotic and vasoconstrictive effects, is potential mechanism of more severe SARS-CoV-2 infection. The link between obesity and severe COVID-19 may be attributed to ACE2 consumption and subsequent ACE-Ang-II-AT1R axis activation. Therefore, patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection may benefit from therapeutic strategies that activate ACE2-Ang 1-7-Mas axis, such as Ang II reseptor blockers (ARBs), ACE inhibitors (ACEIs), Mas receptor agonists and ACE2.

We investigated the effects of sex and age on pain modulatory networks in a healthy state and during OA progression. We used functional MRI to determine the effects of sex and age on periaqueductal gray functional connectivity (PAG FC) in a healthy state (pre-OA) and during the early and late phases of monosodium iodoacetate-induced OA in rats. We then examined how sex and age affect longitudinal changes in PAG FC in OA. In a healthy state, females exhibited more widespread PAG FC than males, and this effect was exaggerated with aging. Young males had moderate PAG FC changes during the early phase but recruited additional brain regions, including the rostral anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), during the late phase. Young females exhibited widespread PAG FC in the early phase, which includes connections to insula, caudal ACC, and nucleus accumbens (NAc). Older groups had strong PAG FC with fewer regions in the early phase, but they recruited additional brain regions, including NAc, in the late phase. Overall, our findings show that PAG FC is modulated by sex and age in a healthy state. A widespread PAG network in the early phase of OA pain may contribute to the transition from acute to chronic OA pain and the increased risk of developing chronic pain for females. Enhanced PAG FC with the reward system may represent a potential mechanism underlying chronic OA pain in elderly patients.","Da Silva, Joyce T; Tricou, Christina; Zhang, Youping; Tofighbakhsh, Amir; Seminowicz, David A; Ro, Jin Y",Aging Cell,213,1

Photoanodes for water oxidation play the determining roles in solar water splitting, while its photoelectrochemical (PEC) performance is severely limited by the hole injection efficiency at the interface of semiconductor/electrolyte. To address this problem, in this research, by employing BiVO4 as the model semiconductor for photoanodes, we develop a novel, facile, and efficient method, which simply applies K cations in the preparation process of BiVO4 photoanodes, to in situ induce a crystalline-amorphous heterophase junction by the formation of an amorphous BiVO4 layer (a-BiVO4) on the surface of the crystalline BiVO4 (c-BiVO4) film for PEC water oxidation. The K cation is the key to stimulate the formation of the heterophase, but not incorporated in the final photoelectrodes. Without sacrificing the light absorption, the in situ formed a-BiVO4 layer accelerates the kinetics of the hole transfer at the photoanode/electrolyte interface, leading to the significantly increased efficiency of the surface hole injection to water molecules. Consequently, the BiVO4 photoanode with the crystalline-amorphous heterophase junction (a-BiVO4/c-BiVO4) exhibits almost twice the photocurrent density at 1.23 V (vs reversible hydrogen electrode) for water oxidation than the bare c-BiVO4 ones. Such advantages from the crystalline-amorphous heterophase junction are still effective even when the a-BiVO4/c-BiVO4 is coated by the cocatalyst of FeOOH, reflecting its broad applications in PEC devices. We believe this study can supply an efficient and simple protocol to enhance the PEC water oxidation performance of photoanodes, and provide a new strategy for the potential large-scale application of the solar energy-conversion related devices.","Zhou, Dinghua; Fan, Ke; Zhuo, Qiming; Zhao, Yilong; Sun, Licheng",ACS appl. mater. interfaces (Online),213,6

Under the circumstances created during lockdown period, children are deprived from the social interaction and companionship; because of which, they are susceptible to psychiatric disorders. Therefore, in this study, efforts were to understand the impacts of lockdown on the mental status of the children of India and their specific causes. STUDY DESIGN: It is a questionnaire-based study. METHODS: A web-based questionnaire was prepared, and 400 parents from four districts of Punjab, India, namely, Ludhiana, Sahibzada Ajit Singh (SAS) Nagar, Sangrur and Ferozepur, were telephonically interviewed. Further, the information collected from the interviews was statistically analysed using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) software. RESULTS: Findings from this study revealed that 73.15% and 51.25% of the children were having signs of increased irritation and anger, respectively; 18.7% and 17.6% of the parents also mentioned the symptoms of depression and anxiety, respectively, among their children, which were also augmented by the changes in their diet, sleep, weight and more usage of the electronic equipment. Children (~76.3%) persistently urge to go outdoors and play with their friends; therefore, they could lag in social development. Further, observations from Pearson's correlation revealed that during lockdown, children's mental health is significantly related to the area of their house, number of children in the family, qualification of their mother and socio-economic status of their family. CONCLUSIONS: This study made it evident that the mental health of the children residing in Punjab, India, was compromised during the lockdown period induced by the COVID-19 pandemic. Findings of this study may also trigger the international authorities to frame the guidelines of lockdown in the interest of mental health of their native children.","Sama, Bhupinder Kaur; Kaur, Palakpreet; Thind, Parteek Singh; Verma, Manpreet Kaur; Kaur, Mandeep; Singh, Dapinder Deep",Child care health dev,213,1

However, the therapeutic application has been simplistically limited to using antioxidants with little correction of diseases, and many biomarkers of OS, although confirming and quantifying the magnitude of this pathology, are not suggestive of the underlying causes behind generation of a large amount of free radicals. Unfortunately, research has not noted the multi-implication parallel phenomenon of Ihtiraq (Combustion) in Unani Medicine, which possesses much richer etiopathological sub-typing and much more variegated selective and specific treatments (and prophylactics) corresponding to each sub-type of Ihtiraq; the identification of each sub-type's molecular counterparts can be used to develop not only sub-types of OS pathologies and corresponding selective treatments/prophylactics but also non-biomolecular factors. Eminent Unani physicians described a deteriorative phenomenon, which they termed as 'Ihtiraq' which stands for extreme metabolism or 'combustion' and is recognized as a fundamental pathology, contributing as a major factor to the development of chronic diseases. Further, Unani Medicine also possesses a pathophysiological phenomenon called 'Hararat Ghariba' (Unnatural Heat) whose diverse associations with Ihtiraq may be correlatable as upstream, parallel, or downstream associations of OS and consequent pathologies. AIM OF THE STUDY: The aim of the study is to: MATERIAL AND METHODS: This review is presented with a noteworthy insight into Unani concepts and a thorough study of classical Unani literature by Ibn Sina (10th century), Zakaria Razi (9th century), Ibn Rushd (12th century), Ibn al-Nafees (13th century), Majusi (10th century), and Jurjani (11th century), and comparative detailed study of modern concepts of OS from literature databases, as well as Google, recent researches, and review articles. RESULT: The study showed very close correspondences between the phenomenon, etiopathology, and treatment and prevention of Ihtiraq in Unani Medicine and OS in contemporary biomolecular medicine. It also revealed sub-types of Ihtiraq and corresponding selective Unani treatments and prophylactics including drugs and non-drug factors. CONCLUSION: After a comprehensive study and analysis of the most recent researches and classical theories, it can be stated that OS can be seen as a molecular level expression of Ihtiraq. Further, various components of Ihtiraq may be used to hypothesize molecular sub-types of OS and propose corresponding specific interventions.","Kausar, Firdaus; Yusuf Amin, Kunwar Mohammad; Bashir, Showkeen; Parvez, Athar; Ahmad, Pervaiz",J Ethnopharmacol,213,1

As a result, the rising demand for psychological assistance during crisis times requires early and effective intervention. This contributes to the well-being of the public and front-line workers and prevents mental health disorders. Many countries are offering diverse and accessible services of tele-psychological intervention; Ecuador is not the exception. The present study combines statistical analyses and discrete optimization techniques to solve the problem of assigning patients to therapists for crisis intervention with a single tele-psychotherapy session. The statistical analyses showed that professionals and healthcare workers in contact with Covid-19 patients or with a confirmed diagnosis had a significant relationship with suicide risk, sadness, experiential avoidance, and perception of severity. Moreover, some Covid-19-related variables were found to be predictors of sadness and suicide risk as unveiled via path analysis. This allowed categorizing patients according to their screening and grouping therapists according to their qualifications. With this stratification, a multi-periodic optimization model and a heuristic are proposed to find an adequate assignment of patients to therapists over time. The integer programming model was validated with real-world data, and its results were applied in a volunteer program in Ecuador.","Miniguano-Trujillo, Andrés; Salazar, Fernanda; Torres, Ramiro; Arias, Patricio; Sotomayor, Koraima",Health Care Manag Sci,213,26

Reagent shortages and restricted access to high throughput testing solutions have limited the effectiveness of conventional assays such as quantitative RT-PCR (RT-qPCR), particularly throughout the first months of the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. We investigated the use of LamPORE, where loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) is coupled to nanopore sequencing technology, for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 in symptomatic and asymptomatic populations. METHODS: In an asymptomatic prospective cohort, for 3 weeks in September 2020, health-care workers across four sites (Birmingham, Southampton, Basingstoke and Manchester) self-swabbed with nasopharyngeal swabs weekly and supplied a saliva specimen daily. These samples were tested for SARS-CoV-2 RNA using the Oxford Nanopore LamPORE system and a reference RT-qPCR assay on extracted sample RNA. A second retrospective cohort of 848 patients with influenza-like illness from March 2020 to June 2020 were similarly tested from nasopharyngeal swabs. RESULTS: In the asymptomatic cohort a total of 1200 participants supplied 23 427 samples (3966 swab, 19 461 saliva) over a 3-week period. The incidence of SARS-CoV-2 detection using LamPORE was 0.95%. Diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of LamPORE was >99.5% (decreasing to approximately 98% when clustered estimation was used) in both swab and saliva asymptomatic samples when compared with the reference RT-qPCR test.

IP-10 is an alternative biomarker with a 100 fold high expression level compared to IFN-Î³, allowing for different analysis platforms including molecular detection. The PCR technique is already an integrated tool in most TB laboratories and thus an obvious platform to turn to. In this case-control study, we investigated the diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of a molecular assay detecting IP-10 mRNA expression following antigen stimulation of a blood sample. We included 89 TB patients and 99 healthy controls. Blood was drawn in QuantiFERON-TB Gold In-Tube (QFT) tubes. Eight hours post-stimulation IP-10 mRNA expression was analyzed and 20 hours post-stimulation IP-10 and IFN-Î³ protein plasma levels were analyzed using an in-house IP-10 ELISA and the official QFT ELISA, respectively. The IP-10 mRNA assay provided a high specificity (98%) and sensitivity (80%) and AUC=0.97, however, the QFT assay provided a higher overall diagnostic potential with specificity (100%) and sensitivity (90%) and AUC=0.99. The IP-10 protein assay performed on par with the QFT assay with specificity (98%) and sensitivity (87%) and AUC=0.98.

While individuals’ willingness to sanction others is decisive for the enforcement of social norms and thus social stability, little is known about individual sanctioning behavior related to newly introduced social norms. During the COVID-19 pandemic, governments have used various tools to rapidly and actively introduce the new norm of wearing a face mask;this offers a unique setting to study the determinants of individuals’ willingness to sanction a cooperation norm. In a nationwide online survey in Germany, we find that higher levels of conscientiousness and neuroticism, but none of the economic preferences (time and risk), are significantly and robustly associated with a higher willingness to sanctioning norm violators. Furthermore, there is a strong relationship between supervisors’ and their subordinates’ willingness to sanction norm violation, and we observe that females have a higher value for the appropriate fine for norm violating behavior than men. Our results shed light on the origins of individual compliance with newly introduced public policy measures that are meant to increase solidarity via the explicit shaping of new cooperation norms.","Schunk, Daniel Wagner Valentin",Journal of Behavioral and Experimental Economics,213,26

Thromboelastography (TEG) maximum amplitude (MA) has been validated as a marker of hypercoagulability and MA &#8805;68 mm has been utilized as a marker of hypercoagulability in other conditions. METHODS: The goal of this study was to evaluate the relationship between coagulation, inflammatory, and TEG parameters in patients with COVID-19 on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). We performed a single-center retrospective analysis of consecutive patients that received ECMO for the treatment of COVID-19. TEG, inflammatory, and coagulation markers were compared in patients with and without a thrombotic complication. Correlation tests were performed to identify the coagulation and inflammatory markers that best predict hypercoagulability as defined by an elevated TEG MA. RESULTS: A total of 168 TEGs were available in 24 patients. C-reactive protein and fibrinogen were significantly higher in patients that developed a thrombotic event versus those that did not (P = 0.04 and P = 0.04 respectively). D-dimer was negatively correlated with TEG MA (P < 0.01), while fibrinogen was positively correlated (P < 0.01). A fibrinogen >441 mg/dL was found to have a sensitivity of 91.2% and specificity of 85.7% for the detection of MA &#8805;68 mm. CONCLUSIONS: In critically ill patients with COVID-19 treated with ECMO, D-dimer concentration had an inverse relationship with degree of hypercoagulability as measured by TEG MA. D-dimer elevation may potentially reflect hemostatic perturbation in patients on ECMO or the severity of COVID-19 related sepsis rather than designate patients likely to benefit from anticoagulation. Fibrinogen concentration may represent a more useful marker of hypercoagulability in this population.","Chandel, Abhimanyu; Patolia, Saloni; Looby, Mary; Bade, Najeebah; Khangoora, Vikramjit; King, Christopher S",J Intensive Care Med,213,24

METHODS: We performed a systematic literature review using PubMed and Embase databases. We included all studies reporting abnormal neuroimaging findings among hospitalized patients with confirmed COVID-19 and outcomes. Data elements including patient demographics, neuroimaging findings, acuity of neurological symptoms and/or imaging findings relative to COVID-19 onset (acute, subacute, chronic), and patient outcomes were recorded and summarized. RESULTS: After review of 775 unique articles, a total of 39 studies comprising 884 COVID-19 patients &#8805; 18 years of age with abnormal neuroimaging findings and reported outcomes were included in our analysis. Ischemic stroke was the most common neuroimaging finding reported (49.3%, 436/884) among patients with mortality outcomes data. Patients with intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) had the highest all-cause mortality (49.7%, 71/143), followed by patients with imaging features consistent with leukoencephalopathy (38.5%, 5/13), and ischemic stroke (30%, 131/436). There was no mortality reported among COVID-19 patients with acute disseminated encephalomyelitis without necrosis (0%, 0/8) and leptomeningeal enhancement alone (0%, 0/12). Stroke was a common acute or subacute neuroimaging finding, while leukoencephalopathy was a common chronic finding. CONCLUSION: Among hospitalized COVID-19 patients with abnormal neuroimaging findings, those with ICH had the highest all-cause mortality; however, high mortality rates were also seen among COVID-19 patients with ischemic stroke in the acute/subacute period and leukoencephalopathy in the chronic period. ADVANCES IN KNOWLEDGE: Specific abnormal neuroimaging findings may portend differential mortality outcomes, providing a potential prognostic marker for hospitalized COVID-19 patients.","Mogensen, Monique A; Wangaryattawanich, Pattana; Hartman, Jason; Filippi, Christopher G; Hippe, Daniel S; Cross, Nathan M",Br J Radiol,213,20

Guanylurea often accumulates and is poorly, if at all, biodegraded in wastewater treatment plants. This study describes Pseudomonas mendocina strain GU, isolated from a municipal wastewater treatment plant, using guanylurea as its sole nitrogen source. The genome was sequenced with 36-fold coverage and mined to identify guanylurea degradation genes. The gene encoding the enzyme initiating guanylurea metabolism was expressed, and the enzyme was purified and characterized. Guanylurea hydrolase, a newly described enzyme, was shown to transform guanylurea to one equivalent (each) of ammonia and guanidine. Guanidine also supports growth as a sole nitrogen source. Cell yields from growth on limiting concentrations of guanylurea revealed that metabolism releases all four nitrogen atoms. Genes encoding complete metabolic transformation were identified bioinformatically, defining the pathway as follows: guanylurea to guanidine to carboxyguanidine to allophanate to ammonia and carbon dioxide. The first enzyme, guanylurea hydrolase, is a member of the isochorismatase-like hydrolase protein family, which includes biuret hydrolase and triuret hydrolase. Although homologs, the three enzymes show distinct substrate specificities. Pairwise sequence comparisons and the use of sequence similarity networks allowed fine structure discrimination between the three homologous enzymes and provided insights into the evolutionary origins of guanylurea hydrolase.IMPORTANCE Metformin is a pharmaceutical most prescribed for type 2 diabetes and is now being examined for potential benefits to COVID-19 patients. People taking the drug pass it largely unchanged, and it subsequently enters wastewater treatment plants. Metformin has been known to be metabolized to guanylurea. The levels of guanylurea often exceed that of metformin, leading to the former being considered a ""dead-end"" metabolite. Metformin and guanylurea are water pollutants of emerging concern, as they persist to reach nontarget aquatic life and humans, the latter if it remains in treated water. The present study has identified a Pseudomonas mendocina strain that completely degrades guanylurea. The genome was sequenced, and the genes involved in guanylurea metabolism were identified in three widely separated genomic regions. This knowledge advances the idea that guanylurea is not a dead-end product and will allow for bioinformatic identification of the relevant genes in wastewater treatment plant microbiomes and other environments subjected to metagenomic sequencing.","Tassoulas, Lambros J; Robinson, Ashley; Martinez-Vaz, Betsy; Aukema, Kelly G; Wackett, Lawrence P",,213,25

However, multiple barriers prevent patients from accessing this treatment option. Objective: To determine if a quality improvement intervention provided in chronic kidney disease (CKD) programs (vs. usual care) enables more patients with no recorded contraindications to kidney transplant to complete more steps toward receiving a kidney transplant. Design: This protocol describes a pragmatic 2-arm, parallel-group, open-label, registry-based, cluster-randomized clinical trial—the Enhance Access to Kidney Transplantation and Living Kidney Donation (EnAKT LKD) trial. Setting: All 26 CKD programs in Ontario, Canada, with a trial start date of November 1, 2017. The original end date of March 31, 2021 (3.4 years) has been extended to December 31, 2021 (4.1 years) due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Participants: During the trial, the 26 CKD programs are expected to care for more than 10 000 adult patients with CKD (including patients approaching the need for dialysis and patients receiving dialysis) with no recorded contraindications to a kidney transplant. Intervention: Programs were randomly allocated to provide a quality improvement intervention or usual care. The intervention has 4 main components: (1) local quality improvement teams and administrative support;(2) tailored education and resources for staff, patients, and living kidney donor candidates;(3) support from kidney transplant recipients and living kidney donors;and (4) program-level performance reports and oversight by program leaders. Primary Outcome: The primary outcome is the number of key steps completed toward receiving a kidney transplant analyzed at the cluster level (CKD program). The following 4 unique steps per patient will be counted: (1) patient referred to a transplant center for evaluation, (2) at least one living kidney donor candidate contacts a transplant center for an intended recipient and completes a health history questionnaire to begin their evaluation, (3) patient added to the deceased donor transplant wait list, and (4) patient receives a kidney transplant from a living or deceased donor. Planned Primary Analysis: Study data will be obtained from Ontario’s linked administrative healthcare databases. An intent-to-treat analysis will be conducted comparing the primary outcome between randomized groups using a 2-stage approach. First stage: residuals are obtained from fitting a regression model to individual-level variables ignoring intervention and clustering effects. Second stage: residuals from the first stage are aggregated at the cluster level as the outcome. Limitations: It may not be possible to isolate independent effects of each intervention component, the usual care group could adopt intervention components leading to contamination bias, and the relatively small number of clusters could mean the 2 arms are not balanced on all baseline prognostic factors. Conclusions: The EnAKT LKD trial will provide high-quality evidence on whether a multi-component quality improvement intervention helps patients complete more steps toward receiving a kidney transplant.

Many of the preventive measures implemented during the pandemic can increase sedentary lifestyles, which can lead to the development of chronic diseases, including obesity, among the general population and cause serious threats to people's physical health and overall quality of life. Individuals with pre-existing comorbidities are at an increased risk of COVID-19 and may hence have higher levels of stress. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate the relationship between physical activity levels and mental health status on an individual level and to compare them between those with and those without comorbidities in a cohort of Texas residents, before and after COVID-19 was declared a pandemic. METHODS: An electronic survey was disseminated throughout various regions of Texas. In total, 160 individuals were asked questions about their demographic characteristics, time spent on daily physical activities, and daily mental health status before and after COVID-19 was declared a pandemic. Frequency distributions and descriptive statistics were analyzed. RESULTS: Overall, 94 (58%) participants reported having &#8805;1 medical condition, and 31 (13.1%) had >3 medical conditions. Physical activity levels among participants with &#8805;1 pre-existing comorbidity drastically-but not significantly-decreased, as evident from a 10% increase in sedentary lifestyles after COVID-19 was declared a pandemic. On the contrary, we observed a 9% increase in the number of individuals without a pre-existing comorbidity who reported 30-60 min of physical activity per week. There was a 2-fold increase in the number of participants reporting more frequent feelings of nervousness, too much worry, trouble relaxing, and the fear of something awful happening after the pandemic. More specifically, individuals with pre-existing medical conditions reported, on average, a 10% higher incidence of feelings of stress, anxiety, and sadness compared to their healthy counterparts after COVID-19 was declared a pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: Stressful life conditions and chronic comorbidities are risk factors that can affect mental health and reduce the ability to perform activities of daily life. Therefore, when implementing pandemic protocols, municipalities should consider providing mental health support to their citizens to protect them from this rather inconspicuous adverse effect.","Patel, Darpan I; Gamez, Yazmin; Shah, Lajja; Patel, Jaini",J Med Internet Res,213,32

The aim of this rapid review is to evaluate the COVID-19 risk associated with the presence of air-conditioning systems. Original studies (both observational and experimental researches) written in English and with no limit on time, on the airborne transmission of SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 coronaviruses that were associated with outbreaks, were included. Searches were made on PubMed/MEDLINE, PubMed Central (PMC), Google Scholar databases, and medRxiv. A snowball strategy was adopted to extend the search. Fourteen studies reporting outbreaks of coronavirus infection associated with the air-conditioning systems were included. All studies were carried out in the Far East. In six out the seven studies on SARS, the role of Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC) in the outbreak was indirectly proven by the spatial and temporal pattern of cases, or by airflow-dynamics models. In one report on MERS, the contamination of HVAC by viral particles was demonstrated. In four out of the six studies on SARS-CoV-2, the diffusion of viral particles through HVAC was suspected or supported by computer simulation. In conclusion, there is sufficient evidence of the airborne transmission of coronaviruses in previous Asian outbreaks, and this has been taken into account in the guidelines released by organizations and international agencies for controlling the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in indoor environments. However, the technological differences in HVAC systems prevent the generalization of the results on a worldwide basis. The few COVID-19 investigations available do not provide sufficient evidence that the SARS-CoV-2 virus can be transmitted by HVAC systems.","Chirico, Francesco; Sacco, Angelo; Bragazzi, Nicola Luigi; Magnavita, Nicola",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),213,33

A pilot study,12.939327,9.174578,2021-06-09,"RNA recombination is one of the driving forces of genetic variability in (+)-strand RNA viruses. Various types of RNA–RNA crossovers were described including crosses between the same or different viral RNAs or between viral and cellular RNAs. Likewise, a variety of molecular mechanisms are known to support RNA recombination, such as replicative events (based on internal or end-to-end replicase switchings) along with non-replicative joining among RNA fragments of viral and/or cellular origin. Such mechanisms as RNA decay or RNA interference are responsible for RNA fragmentation and trans-esterification reactions which are likely accountable for ligation of RNA fragments. Numerous host factors were found to affect the profiles of viral RNA recombinants and significant differences in recombination frequency were observed among various RNA viruses. Comparative analyses of viral sequences allowed for the development of evolutionary models in order to explain adaptive phenotypic changes and co-evolving sites. Many questions remain to be answered by forthcoming RNA recombination research. (1) How various factors modulate the ability of viral replicase to switch templates, (2) What is the intracellular location of RNA–RNA template switchings, (3) Mechanisms and factors responsible for non-replicative RNA recombination, (4) Mechanisms of integration of RNA viral sequences with cellular genomic DNA, and (5) What is the role of RNA splicing and ribozyme activity. From an evolutionary stand point, it is not known how RNA viruses parasitize new host species via recombination, nor is it obvious what the contribution of RNA recombination is among other RNA modification pathways. We do not understand why the frequency of RNA recombination varies so much among RNA viruses and the status of RNA recombination as a form of sex is not well documented.","Bujarski, Jozef J.",Front Plant Sci,213,17

Infections can lead to skin eruptions and mimic drug hypersensitivity reactions (DHR), if a drug is taken at the same time. The most of children are labeled as ‘drug allergic’ after considering only the clinical history. OBJECTIVE: To diagnose/detect a hypersensitivity or an infection which mimic DHR in children with non‐immediate reactions to BL METHODS: A prospective survey was conducted in a group of 1026 children with histories of non‐immediate reactions to BL by performing patch tests, skin tests, and in case of negative results, drug provocation tests (DPTs). In 300 children, a study was performed to detect infections by viruses or Mycoplasma pneumoniae. RESULTS: Urticaria and maculopapular exanthemas were the most reported non‐immediate reactions. Only 76 (7.4%) of 1026 children had confirmed non‐immediate hypersensitivity reactions to BL. Fifty‐seven children had positive delayed‐reading intradermal tests (18 of these with a positive patch test). Nineteen children had positive DPT. Sixty‐six of 300 children had positive tests for viruses or Mycoplasma pneumoniae and 2 of them had a positive allergy work‐up. CONCLUSIONS: A diagnostic work‐up should be performed in all children with non‐immediate reactions to BL, to remove a false label of hypersensitivity. Even though only 57 (5.5%) of 1026 children displayed positive responses to delayed‐reading intradermal tests to BL, such tests appear to be useful in order to reduce the risk for positive DPTs.","Atanaskovic‐Markovic, Marina; Gaeta, Francesco; Medjo, Biljana; Gavrovic‐Jankulovic, Marija; Cirkovic Velickovic, Tanja; Tmusic, Vladimir; Romano, Antonino",Pediatr Allergy Immunol,213,7

In the absence of any symptoms, individuals do not know their type and continuously tradeoff the costs and benefits of self-isolation on the basis of their belief of being the severe type. We show that all equilibria of the game involve social interaction, and we characterize the unique equilibrium in which individuals partially self-isolate at each date.

Here, we devised a versatile serological test, named ABCORA, that is based on a multifactorial analysis of SARS-CoV-2 and circulating human coronavirus (HCoV) antibody responses. Utilizing empirical tailored cut-offs and computational approaches based on training and validation cohorts comprising pre-pandemic (N=825) and SARS-CoV-2 infected plasma donors (N=389), we defined several analysis strategies that allow a highly accurate definition of SARS-CoV-2 seroconversion and prediction of neutralization activity. Intriguingly, HCoV reactivity was significantly higher in SARS-CoV-2 negative donors. Amongst SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals, elevated SARS-CoV-2 responses were linked to higher HCoV activity suggesting that pre-existing HCoV immunity may confer protection against SARS-CoV-2 acquisition and promote development of SARS-CoV-2 specific antibody responses. Deciphering interdependencies between SARS-CoV-2 and HCoV immunity should be enforced as understanding their impact on infection may allow soliciting cross-protective activities for broader coronavirus prevention.","Abela, I.

In this manuscript, we studied the epidemic peaks of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) in Brazil by the successful application of Predictor-Corrector (P-C) scheme. For the proposed model of COVID-19, the numerical solutions are performed by a model framework of the recent generalized Caputo type non-classical derivative. Existence of unique solution of the given non-linear problem is presented in terms of theorems. A new analysis of epidemic peaks in Brazil with the help of parameter values cited from a real data is effectuated. Graphical simulations show the obtained results to classify the importance of the classes of projected model. We observed that the proposed fractional technique is smoothly work in the coding and very easy to implement for the model of non-linear equations. By this study we tried to exemplify the roll of newly proposed fractional derivatives in mathematical epidemiology. The main purpose of this paper is to predict the epidemic peak of COVID-19 in Brazil at different transmission rates. We have also attempted to give the stability analysis of the proposed numerical technique by the reminder of some important lemmas. At last we concluded that when the infection rate increases then the nature of the diseases changes by becoming more deathly to the population.","Kumar, Pushpendra; Erturk, Vedat Suat; Abboubakar, Hamadjam; Nisar, Kottakkaran Sooppy",,213,1

Several virus-encoded nonstructural proteins play a key role during the viral life cycle. Endoribonuclease NSP15 is vital for the replication and life cycle of the virus, and is thus considered a compelling druggable target. Here, we performed a combination of multiscoring virtual screening and molecular docking of a library of 1624 natural compounds (Nuclei of Bioassays, Ecophysiology and Biosynthesis of Natural Products (NuBBE) database) on the active sites of NSP15 (PDB:6VWW). After sequential high-throughput screening by LibDock and GOLD, docking optimization by CDOCKER, and final scoring by calculating binding energies, top-ranked compounds NuBBE-1970 and NuBBE-242 were further investigated via an indepth molecular-docking and molecular-dynamics simulation of 60 ns, which revealed that the binding of these two compounds with active site residues of NSP15 was sufficiently strong and stable. The findings strongly suggest that further optimization and clinical investigations of these potent compounds may lead to effective SARS-CoV-2 treatment.","Saeed, Mohd; Saeed, Amir; Alam, Md Jahoor; Alreshidi, Mousa",Molecules,213,20

Methods: Participants were recruited as part of the COVID-19 Mother Baby Outcomes (COMBO) cohort at Columbia University (N=71 non-Hispanic White, N=14 African American (AA), N=113 Hispanic, N=40 other/declined). Data on infant sleep were collected at 4 months postpartum. A subset of 149 women also completed questionnaires assessing maternal mental health and sleep. Multivariable regressions were used to separately estimate associations of race/ethnicity and mental health with multiple sleep domains for infants and mothers adjusting for individual-level covariates. Results: Compared to non-Hispanic White, Hispanic infants slept less at night ({beta}=-101.7{+/-}17.6, p<0.0001) and AA and Hispanic infants went to bed later (respectively {beta} =1.9{+/-}0.6, p<0.0001, {beta}=1.7{+/-}0.3, p<0.0001). Hispanic mothers were less likely to perceive infant sleep as a problem ({beta}=1.0{+/-}0.3, p=0.006). Compared to non-Hispanic White mothers, Hispanic mothers reported worse maternal sleep latency ({beta}=1.2{+/-}0.4, p=0.002), and efficiency ({beta}=0.8{+/-}0.4, p=0.03), but better subjective sleep quality ({beta}=-0.7{+/-}0.4, p=0.05), and less daytime dysfunction ({beta}=-0.8{+/-}0.4, p=0.04).

Although lungs seem to be the main target of the infection, very few information are available about liver involvement, possibly evocating a systemic disease. Post‐mortem wedge liver biopsies from 48 patients died from severe pulmonary COVID‐19 disease with respiratory failure were collected from two main hospitals in northern Italy. No patient had clinical symptoms of liver disease or signs of liver failure before and during hospitalization; for each of them liver function tests were available. All liver samples showed minimal inflammation features. Histological pictures compatible with vascular alterations were observed, characterized by increase in number of portal vein branches associated with lumen massive dilatation, partial or complete luminal thrombosis of portal and sinusoidal vessels, fibrosis of portal tract, focally markedly enlarged and fibrotic. SARS‐CoV‐2 was found in 15 of 22 samples tested by in situ hybridization method. Our preliminary results confirm the clinical impression that liver failure is not a main concern and this organ is not the target of significant inflammatory damage. Histopathological findings are highly suggestive for marked derangement of intrahepatic blood vessel network secondary to systemic changes induced by virus that could target not only lung parenchyma but also cardiovascular system, coagulation cascade and endothelial layer of blood vessels. It still remains unclear if the mentioned changes are directly related to virus infection or if SARS‐CoV‐2 triggers a series of reactions leading to striking vascular alterations.","Sonzogni, Aurelio; Previtali, Giulia; Seghezzi, Michela; Grazia Alessio, Maria; Gianatti, Andrea; Licini, Lisa; Morotti, Denise; Zerbi, Pietro; Carsana, Luca; Rossi, Roberta; Lauri, Eleonora; Pellegrinelli, Alessandro; Nebuloni, Manuela",Liver Int,213,6

While decreased alertness and increased anxiety can be considered side effects of symptomatology, symptoms alone may not be responsible for the psychomotor and attention deficits of colds and influenza, respectively. An alternative hypothesis, as proposed in this review, suggests that the immune response, in the form of a cytokine cascade, may be responsible for both the physical and psychological symptoms. In particular, patterns of cytokine production for each infection will dictate the symptoms and performance deficits both within and between viruses. This hypothesis can be extended to incorporate infectious mononucleosis, as well as colds and influenza.

Many predictive tools developed to date are complex, rely on multiple blood results and past medical history, do not include chest X ray results and rely on Artificial Intelligence rather than simplified algorithms. Our aim was to develop a simplified risk-tool based on five parameters and CXR image data that predicts the 60-day survival of adult SARS CoV-2 positive patients at hospital admission. Methods We analysed the NCCID database of patient blood variables and CXR images from 19 hospitals across the UK contributed clinical data on SARS CoV-2 positive patients using multivariable logistic regression. The initial dataset was non-randomly split between development and internal validation dataset with 1434 and 310 SARS CoV-2 positive patients, respectively. External validation of final model conducted on 741 Accident and Emergency admissions with suspected SARS CoV-2 infection from a separate NHS Trust which was not part of the initial NCCID data set. Findings The LUCAS mortality score included five strongest predictors (lymphocyte count, urea, CRP, age, sex), which are available at any point of care with rapid turnaround of results. Our simple multivariable logistic model showed high discrimination for fatal outcome with the AUC-ROC in development cohort 0.765 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.738 - 0.790), in internal validation cohort 0.744 (CI: 0.673 - 0.808), and in external validation cohort 0.752 (CI: 0.713 - 0.787). The discriminatory power of LUCAS mortality score was increased slightly when including the CXR image data (for normal versus abnormal): internal validation AUC-ROC 0.770 (CI: 0.695 - 0.836) and external validation AUC-ROC 0.791 (CI: 0.746 - 0.833). The discriminatory power of LUCAS and LUCAS + CXR performed in the upper quartile of pre-existing risk stratification scores with the added advantage of using only 5 predictors. Interpretation This simplified prognostic tool derived from objective parameters can be used to obtain valid predictions of mortality in patients within 60 days SARS CoV-2 RT-PCR results.

The epidemiological indexes, clinical symptoms and laboratory test results of the patients were retrospectively analyzed. Those parameters with significant differences between the two groups were analyzed, and the combination parameters with best diagnostic performance were selected using the LDA method. Results: Of the 45 patients with COVID-19 (35 moderate and 10 severe cases), 23 were male and 22 female, aged 16-62 years. The most common clinical symptoms were fever (89%) and dry cough (60%). As the disease progressed, WBC, Neu#, NLR, PLR, RDW-CV and RDW-SD parameters in the severe group were significantly higher than that in the moderate group (P<0.05); meanwhile, Lym#, Eos#, HFC%, RBC, HGB and HCT parameters in the severe group were significantly lower than that in the moderate group (P<0.05). For NLR, the AUC, the best cut-off value, the sensitivity and the specificity were 0.890, 13.39, 83.3% and 82.4% respectively, and for PLR , the AUC, the best cut-off, the sensitivity and the specificity were 0.842, 267.03, 83.3% and 74.0% respectively. The combined parameter NLR&RDW-SD had the best diagnostic efficiency (AUC was 0.938) and when the cut-off value was 1.046, the sensitivity and the specificity were 90.0% and 84.7% respectively, followed by the fitting parameter NLR&RDW-CV (AUC = 0.923). When the cut-off value was 0.62, the sensitivity and the specificity for distinguishing severe type from moderate cases of COVID-19 were 90.0% and 82.4% respectively. Conclusions: The combined parameter NLR&RDW-SD is the best hematology index and can help clinicians to predict the severity of COVID-19 patients, and it can be used as a useful indicator to help prevent and control the epidemic.","wang, changzheng; Li, Chengbin",,213,11

To that end, on a sample of Italian citizens, we implemented a path model to test the impact of health engagement on the willingness to vaccinate against SARS-CoV-2, and whether this relationship is direct or mediated by the general attitude towards vaccines and the risk perception. Moreover, we tested the configural and weak invariance of the model across gender and three age groups. Results show that health engagement is positively related to the intention to vaccinate and that this relationship is partially mediated by the general attitude towards vaccines. The model appears invariant across genders and partially invariant across age groups, showing some differences in the role of perceived susceptibility.

The simulation results seemed to suggest that the close contact route was probably the most significant route (contributes 70%, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 67%‐72%) in the in‐flight transmission of influenza A H1N1 transmission; as a result, passengers within 2 rows of the index case had a significantly higher infection risk than others in the outbreak (relative risk [RR]: 13.4, 95% CI: 1.5‐121.2, P = .019).

Genomic surveillance is an important tool for pandemic response, but many laboratories do not have the resources to support population-level sequencing. We hypothesized that a nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT) to genotype mutations in the viral spike protein could facilitate high-throughput variant surveillance. We designed and analytically validated a one-step multiplex allele-specific reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) to detect three non-synonymous spike protein mutations (L452R, E484K, N501Y). Assay specificity was validated with next-generation whole-genome sequencing. We then screened a large cohort of SARS-CoV-2 positive specimens from our San Francisco Bay Area population. Between December 1, 2020 and March 1, 2021, we screened 4,049 unique infections by genotyping RT-qPCR, with an assay failure rate of 2.8%. We detected 1,567 L452R mutations (38.7%), 34 N501Y mutations (0.84%), 22 E484K mutations (0.54%), and 3 (0.07%) E484K+N501Y mutations.

The assay revealed rapid emergence of L452R in our population, with a prevalence of 24.8% in December 2020 that increased to 62.5% in March 2021.

Devices such as barrier boxes are being considered as potential adjuncts to full PPE’s to limit the aerosol spread. Usage of the barrier box raises concerns of delay in time to intubate (TTI). We designed our study to determine if using a barrier box with glidescope delays TTI within acceptable parameters to make relevant clinical conclusions. METHODS: Seventy-eight patients were enrolled in this prospective non-inferiority controlled trial and were randomly allocated to either group C (without the barrier box) or the study group BB (using barrier box). The primary measured endpoint is time to intubate (TTI), which is defined as time taken from loss of twitches confirmed with a peripheral nerve stimulator to confirmation of end-tidal CO (2.) 15 s was used as non-inferiority margin for the purpose of the study. We used an unpaired two-sample single-sided t-test to test our non- inferiority hypothesis (H (0): Mean TTI diff ≥15 s, H (A): Mean TTI diff < 15 s). Secondary endpoints include the number of attempts at intubation, lowest oxygen saturation during induction, and the need for bag-mask ventilation. RESULTS: Mean TTI in group C was 42 s (CI 19.2 to 64.8) vs. 52.1 s (CI 26.1 to 78) in group BB. The difference in mean TTI was 10.1 s (CI -∞ to 14.9). We rejected the null hypothesis and concluded with 95% confidence that the difference of the mean TTI between the groups is less than < 15 s (95% CI -∞ to 14.9,p = 0.0461). Our induction times were comparable (67.7 vs. 65.9 s).100% of our patients were intubated on the first attempt in both groups. None of our patients needed rescue breaths. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that in patients with normal airway exam, scheduled for elective surgeries, our barrier box did not cause any clinically significant delay in TTI when airway manipulation is performed by well-trained providers.

If chlorhexidine, a usual component of mouth rinse, is not efficient to kill SARS-CoV-2, the use of a mouth rinses and/or with local nasal applications that contain β-cyclodextrins combined with flavonoids agents, such as Citrox, could provide valuable adjunctive treatment to reduce the viral load of saliva and nasopharyngeal microbiota, including potential SARS-CoV-2 carriage. We urge national agencies and authorities to start clinical trials to evaluate the preventive effects of βCD-Citrox therapeutic oral biofilm rinses in reducing the viral load of the infection and possibly disease progression.","Carrouel, Florence; Conte, Maria Pia; Fisher, Julian; Gonçalves, Lucio Souza; Dussart, Claude; Llodra, Juan Carlos; Bourgeois, Denis",J Clin Med,213,16

In the vast majority of cases, cutaneous symptoms precede musculoskeletal complaints. Progression from psoriasis to PsA is characterized by subclinical synovio-entheseal inflammation and often non-specific musculoskeletal symptoms that are frequently unreported or overlooked. With the development of increasingly effective therapies and a broad drug armamentarium, prevention of arthritis development through careful clinical monitoring has become priority. Identifying high-risk psoriasis patients before PsA onset would ensure early diagnosis, increased treatment efficacy, and ultimately better outcomes; ideally, PsA development could even be averted. However, the current model of care for PsA offers only limited possibilities of early intervention. This is attributable to the large pool of patients to be monitored and the limited resources of the health care system in comparison. The use of digital technologies for health (eHealth) could help close this gap in care by enabling faster, more targeted and more streamlined access to rheumatological care for patients with psoriasis. eHealth solutions particularly include telemedicine, mobile technologies, and symptom checkers. Telemedicine enables rheumatological visits and consultations at a distance while mobile technologies can improve monitoring by allowing patients to self-report symptoms and disease-related parameters continuously. Symptom checkers have the potential to direct patients to medical attention at an earlier point of their disease and therefore minimizing diagnostic delay. Overall, these interventions could lead to earlier diagnoses of arthritis, improved monitoring, and better disease control while simultaneously increasing the capacity of referral centers.","Fagni, Filippo; Knitza, Johannes; Krusche, Martin; Kleyer, Arnd; Tascilar, Koray; Simon, David",Front Med (Lausanne),213,20

Apart from this antimalarial activity, CQ and HCQ have gained interest in the field of other infectious diseases. One of the most interesting mechanisms of action is that CQ leads to alkalinisation of acid vesicles that inhibit the growth of several intracellular bacteria and fungi. The proof of concept of this effect was first used to restore intracellular pH allowing antibiotic efficacy for Coxiella burnetii, the agent of Q fever, and doxycycline plus HCQ is now the reference treatment for chronic Q fever. There is also strong evidence of a similar effect in vitro against Tropheryma whipplei, the agent of Whipple's disease, and a clinical trial is in progress. Other bacteria and fungi multiply in an acidic environment and encouraging in vitro data suggest that this concept may be generalised for all intracellular organisms that multiply in an acidic environment. For viruses, CQ led to inhibition of uncoating and/or alteration of post-translational modifications of newly synthesised proteins, especially inhibition of glycosylation. These effects have been well described in vitro for many viruses, with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) being the most studied. Preliminary in vivo clinical trials suggest that CQ alone or in combination with antiretroviral drugs might represent an interesting way to treat HIV infection. In conclusion, our review re-emphasises the paradigm that activities mediated by lysosomotropic agents may offer an interesting weapon to face present and future infectious diseases worldwide.","Rolain, Jean-Marc; Colson, Philippe; Raoult, Didier",Int J Antimicrob Agents,213,32

Information regarding the impact of cardiovascular complication on fatal outcome is scarce. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the association of underlying cardiovascular disease (CVD) and myocardial injury with fatal outcomes in patients with COVID-19. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This retrospective single-center case series analyzed patients with COVID-19 at the Seventh Hospital of Wuhan City, China, from January 23, 2020, to February 23, 2020. Analysis began February 25, 2020. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Demographic data, laboratory findings, comorbidities, and treatments were collected and analyzed in patients with and without elevation of troponin T (TnT) levels. RESULT: Among 187 patients with confirmed COVID-19, 144 patients (77%) were discharged and 43 patients (23%) died. The mean (SD) age was 58.50 (14.66) years. Overall, 66 (35.3%) had underlying CVD including hypertension, coronary heart disease, and cardiomyopathy, and 52 (27.8%) exhibited myocardial injury as indicated by elevated TnT levels. The mortality during hospitalization was 7.62% (8 of 105) for patients without underlying CVD and normal TnT levels, 13.33% (4 of 30) for those with underlying CVD and normal TnT levels, 37.50% (6 of 16) for those without underlying CVD but elevated TnT levels, and 69.44% (25 of 36) for those with underlying CVD and elevated TnTs. Patients with underlying CVD were more likely to exhibit elevation of TnT levels compared with the patients without CVD (36 [54.5%] vs 16 [13.2%]). Plasma TnT levels demonstrated a high and significantly positive linear correlation with plasma high-sensitivity C-reactive protein levels (β = 0.530, P < .001) and N-terminal pro–brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) levels (β = 0.613, P < .001). Plasma TnT and NT-proBNP levels during hospitalization (median [interquartile range (IQR)], 0.307 [0.094-0.600]; 1902.00 [728.35-8100.00]) and impending death (median [IQR], 0.141 [0.058-0.860]; 5375 [1179.50-25695.25]) increased significantly compared with admission values (median [IQR], 0.0355 [0.015-0.102]; 796.90 [401.93-1742.25]) in patients who died (P = .001; P < .001), while no significant dynamic changes of TnT (median [IQR], 0.010 [0.007-0.019]; 0.013 [0.007-0.022]; 0.011 [0.007-0.016]) and NT-proBNP (median [IQR], 352.20 [174.70-636.70]; 433.80 [155.80-1272.60]; 145.40 [63.4-526.50]) was observed in survivors (P = .96; P = .16). During hospitalization, patients with elevated TnT levels had more frequent malignant arrhythmias, and the use of glucocorticoid therapy (37 [71.2%] vs 69 [51.1%]) and mechanical ventilation (41 [59.6%] vs 14 [10.4%]) were higher compared with patients with normal TnT levels. The mortality rates of patients with and without use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin receptor blockers was 36.8% (7 of 19) and 25.6% (43 of 168). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Myocardial injury is significantly associated with fatal outcome of COVID-19, while the prognosis of patients with underlying CVD but without myocardial injury is relatively favorable. Myocardial injury is associated with cardiac dysfunction and arrhythmias. Inflammation may be a potential mechanism for myocardial injury. Aggressive treatment may be considered for patients at high risk of myocardial injury.","Guo, Tao; Fan, Yongzhen; Chen, Ming; Wu, Xiaoyan; Zhang, Lin; He, Tao; Wang, Hairong; Wan, Jing; Wang, Xinghuan; Lu, Zhibing",JAMA Cardiology,213,20

There are numerous FDA approved drugs and other small molecules described in the literature that could be further evaluated for their potential as antiviral compounds. These molecules are in addition to the few new antivirals that have been tested in Ebola patients but were not originally developed against the Ebola virus, and may play an important role as we await an effective vaccine. The balance between using FDA approved drugs versus novel antivirals with minimal safety and no efficacy data in humans should be considered. We have evaluated 55 molecules from the perspective of an experienced medicinal chemist as well as using simple molecular properties and have highlighted 16 compounds that have desirable qualities as well as those that may be less desirable. In addition we propose that a collaborative database for sharing such published and novel information on small molecules is needed for the research community studying the Ebola virus.","Litterman, Nadia; Lipinski, Christopher; Ekins, Sean",F1000Res,213,27

Despite its importance, a molecular-level understanding of the LNP structures and dynamics is still lacking, which makes a rational LNP design almost impossible. In this work, we present an extension of CHARMM-GUI Membrane Builder to model and simulate all-atom LNPs with various (ionizable) cationic lipids and PEGylated lipids (PEG-lipids). These new lipid types can be mixed with any existing lipid types with or without a biomolecule of interest, and the generated systems can be simulated using various molecular dynamics engines. As a first illustration, we considered model LNP membranes with DLin-KC2-DMA (KC2) or DLin-MC3-DMA (MC3) without PEG-lipids. The results from these model membranes are consistent with those from the two previous studies albeit with mild accumulation of neutral MC3 in the bilayer center. To demonstrate Membrane Builder’s capability of building a realistic LNP patch, we generated KC2- or MC3-containing LNP membranes with high concentrations of cholesterol and ionizable cationic lipids together with 2 mol% PEG-lipids. We observe that PEG-chains are flexible, which can be more preferentially extended laterally in the presence of cationic lipids due to the attractive interactions between their head groups and PEG oxygen. The presence of PEG-lipids also relaxes the lateral packing in LNP membranes, and the area compressibility modulus (K(A)) of LNP membranes with cationic lipids fit into typical K(A) of fluid-phase membranes. Interestingly, the interactions between PEG oxygen and head group of ionizable cationic lipids induce a negative curvature. We hope that this LNP capability in Membrane Builder can be useful to better characterize various LNPs with or without genetic drugs for a rational LNP design.","Park, Soohyung; Choi, Yeol Kyo; Kim, Seonghoon; Lee, Jumin; Im, Wonpil",bioRxiv,213,29

We aim to explore risk factors associated with mortality in COVID-19 patients and assess the use of D-dimer as a biomarker for disease severity and clinical outcome. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed the clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics of 248 consecutive cases of COVID-19 in Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, China from January 28 to March 08, 2020. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression methods were used to explore risk factors associated with in-hospital mortality. Correlations of D-dimer upon admission with disease severity and in-hospital mortality were analyzed. Receiver operating characteristic curve was used to determine the optimal cutoff level for D-dimer that discriminated those survivors versus non-survivors during hospitalization. RESULTS: Multivariable regression that showed D-dimer > 2.0 mg/L at admission was the only variable associated with increased odds of mortality [OR 10.17 (95% CI 1.10–94.38), P = 0.041]. D-dimer elevation (≥ 0.50 mg/L) was seen in 74.6% (185/248) of the patients. Pulmonary embolism and deep vein thrombosis were ruled out in patients with high probability of thrombosis. D-dimer levels significantly increased with increasing severity of COVID-19 as determined by clinical staging (Kendall’s tau-b = 0.374, P = 0.000) and chest CT staging (Kendall’s tau-b = 0.378, P = 0.000). In-hospital mortality rate was 6.9%. Median D-dimer level in non-survivors (n = 17) was significantly higher than in survivors (n = 231) [6.21 (3.79–16.01) mg/L versus 1.02 (0.47–2.66) mg/L, P = 0.000]. D-dimer level of > 2.14 mg/L predicted in-hospital mortality with a sensitivity of 88.2% and specificity of 71.3% (AUC 0.85; 95% CI = 0.77–0.92). CONCLUSIONS: D-dimer is commonly elevated in patients with COVID-19. D-dimer levels correlate with disease severity and are a reliable prognostic marker for in-hospital mortality in patients admitted for COVID-19.","Yao, Yumeng; Cao, Jiatian; Wang, Qingqing; Shi, Qingfeng; Liu, Kai; Luo, Zhe; Chen, Xiang; Chen, Sisi; Yu, Kaihuan; Huang, Zheyong; Hu, Bijie",J Intensive Care,213,1

The cloud-based common data model and standardized nomenclature of the registry platform ensure interoperability of data and reporting between regional and global stakeholders. Inbuilt analytics enable stakeholders to visualize individual and aggregate epidemiological, clinical, and operational data in real time. The PRICE system operates in 5 of 7 administrative regions of Pakistan. The same platform supports acute and critical care registries in eleven countries in South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa.

Cattle and especially calves have been identified as one of the most common reservoirs of this protist. However, little is known about the genetics of Cryptosporidium in calves in some regions of France. The aim of this study was to detect and isolate Cryptosporidium spp. in faecal samples from naturally infected pre-weaned calves (≤45 days-old) in France. A total of 35 diarrhoeic pre-weaned calf faecal samples were collected from 26 dairy cattle farms in six departments (French administrative provinces). Cryptosporidium presence was established by microscopically screening samples for oocystes with an immunofluorescent (DFA) staining method. DFA-positive samples were then analysed by PCR-RFLP and 18S rRNA gene sequencing to determine species. Cryptosporidium parvum-positive samples were subtyped via nested PCR analysis of a partial fragment of the 60 kDa glycoprotein (gp60) gene product. Data were then integrated into phylogenetic tree analysis. DFA revealed the presence of Cryptosporidium oocysts in 31 out of 35 (88%) samples. Combined with 18S rRNA gene analysis results, C. parvum was detected in 30 samples. Subtyping analysis in 27/30 samples (90%) of the C. parvum isolates revealed two zoonotic subtype families, IIa (24/27) and IId (3/27). Four subtypes were recognised within the subtype family IIa, including the hypertransmissible IIaA15G2R1 subtype that is the most frequently reported worldwide (21/27), IIaA17G3R1 (1/27), IIaA17G1R1 (1/27), and IIaA19G1R1 (1/27). Two subtypes were recognised within the IId subtype family including IIdA22G1 (2/27) and IIdA27G1 (1/27). These findings illustrate the high occurrence of Cryptosporidium in calves in dairy herds and increase the diversity of molecularly characterised C. parvum isolates with the first description of IIaA17G3R1, IIaA19G1R1, and IId subtypes in France. The presence of zoonotic C. parvum subtype families (IIa, IId) in this study suggests that pre-weaned calves are likely to be a significant reservoir of zoonotic C. parvum, and highlights the importance of animal to human cryptosporidiosis transmission risk. Further molecular studies in calves and small ruminants from other French regions are required to better understand the epidemiology of cryptosporidiosis in France.","Mammeri, Mohamed; Chevillot, Aurélie; Chenafi, Ilham; Thomas, Myriam; Julien, Christine; Vallée, Isabelle; Polack, Bruno; Follet, Jérôme; Adjou, Karim Tarik",Vet Parasitol Reg Stud Reports,213,9

METHODS: This is a case report and literature review. RESULTS: A 48-year-old man presented to the ophthalmic emergency department with progressive bilateral corneal melting 5 weeks after receiving the first dose of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (Covishield) vaccine. Systemic complaints of fever, diarrhea, and vomiting were noted in the first 2 weeks, which subsided before the onset of ocular symptoms at day 21 of vaccine administration. The patient could only perceive light bilaterally and demonstrated features of bilateral keratolysis with choroidal detachment on ultrasonography. The microbiological scraping specimen did not reveal growth of any microorganism. Tectonic penetrating keratoplasty was performed, and the host corneal tissue was sent for histopathology, bacterial culture, fungal culture, polymerase chain reaction for herpes simplex virus, varicella zoster virus, cytomegalovirus, adenovirus, and SARS-CoV-2. Microbial culture was sterile, and viral polymerase chain reaction reports were negative. Histopathological examination revealed dense inflammatory cell infiltration. Detailed systemic workup revealed no underlying systemic or autoimmune pathology. CONCLUSIONS: Immune-mediated keratolysis after ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (Covishield) vaccination is a rare entity, and we believe that this is the first report of a temporal association between a serious ocular adverse event after a single dose of any SARS-CoV-19 vaccine.

Elevated cardiac troponin T (cTn T) at admission was associated with increased in-hospital mortality. However, data addressing the role of cTn T in major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) in COVID-19 are scarce. Therefore, we assessed the role of baseline cTn T and cTn T kinetics for MACE and in-hospital mortality prediction in COVID-19. METHODS: Three hundred and ten patients were included prospectively. One hundred and eight patients were excluded due to incomplete records. Patients were divided into three groups according to cTn T kinetics: ascending, descending, and constant. The cTn T slope was defined as the ratio of the cTn T change over time. The primary and secondary endpoints were MACE and in-hospital mortality. RESULTS: Two hundred and two patients were included in the analysis (mean age 64.4 ± 16.7 years, 119 [58.9%] males). Mean duration of hospitalization was 14.0 ± 12.3 days. Sixty (29.7%) patients had MACE, and 40 (19.8%) patients died.

Design: Prospective, cross-sectional survey of adults (N=2001) living in Bangladesh. Methods: Participants were interviewed for socio-demographic data and completed the Bengali translated Brief-COPE Inventory. Statistical data analysis was conducted using SPSS (Version 20). Results: Participants (N=2001), aged 18 to 86 years, were recruited from eight administrative divisions within Bangladesh (mean age 31.85, SD 14.2 years). Male to female participant ratio was 53.4% (n=1074) to 46.6% (n=927). Higher scores were reported for approach coping styles (29.83, SD 8.9), with lower scores reported for avoidant coping styles (20.83, SD 6.05). Humor coping scores were reported at 2.68, SD 1.3, and religion coping scores at 5.64, SD 1.8. Both men and women showed similar coping styles. Multivariate analysis found a significant relationship between the male gender and both humor and avoidant coping (p <.01). Male gender was found to be inversely related to both religion and approach coping (p<.01). Marital status and education were significantly related to all coping style domains (p<.01). The occupation was significantly related to approach coping (p <.01). Rural and urban locations differed significantly in participant coping styles (p <.01). Factor analysis revealed two cluster groups (Factor 1 and 2) comprised of unique combinations from all coping style domains. Conclusion: Participants in this study coped with the COVID-19 pandemic by utilizing a combination of coping strategies. Factor 1 revealed both avoidant and approach coping strategies and Factor 2 revealed a combination of humor and avoidant coping strategies. Overall, higher utilization of approach coping strategies was reported, which has previously been associated with better physical and mental health outcomes.

Using a transposon-mediated gene-activation screen in human cells, we identify that the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II transactivator (CIITA) has antiviral activity against EBOV. CIITA induces resistance by activating expression of the p41 isoform of invariant chain CD74, which inhibits viral entry by blocking cathepsin-mediated processing of the Ebola glycoprotein. We further show that CD74 p41 can block the endosomal entry pathway of coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2.

Virus discovery and rapid implementation of diagnostic tests for newly discovered viruses has strongly beneficiated from the development of molecular techniques. Viral load and antiviral resistance or subtyping assays are now part of the biological monitoring of patients chronically infected by human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV) and CMV. It will be important to add to this panel assays for other viruses of the herpesviridae family. Qualitative assays for the detection of blood-borne viruses have increased safety of blood donation and organ transplantation. Screening of other blood-borne viruses (parvovirus B19, HAV), multiplexing of detection and test automation to improve practicability and reduce costs will be the next steps. A major evolution in the near future will be the generalization of NAT for the diagnosis of viral etiology in patients, mostly with respiratory, CNS or gastro-intestinal diseases. Major technical improvements have been made to avoid obstacles that still limit this generalization, i.e. genetic variability of viruses, multiplex detection, contamination risk. Commercial offers already exist but menus must be extended to limit the validation and documentation work associated with home-brew assays. Real-time amplification has allowed the development of new NAT platforms but automation and integration of all steps of the reaction are still required to reduce hands-on-time, time-to-result and costs, and to increase throughput.","Vernet, Guy",J Clin Virol,213,20

The investigation of this biomarker for detection of carious lesions is an even more actual procedure due to its non-invasiveness and the ease of withdrawal. The purpose of the present observational case-control study was to evaluate whether the quantification of sCD14 in children and adolescent’s saliva can discriminate healthy subjects from those suffering from tooth decay. Materials and Methods: 164 subjects (6 to 17 years) were selected and divided into 2 groups: those with at least 1 decayed tooth were assigned to group Decayed (n = 82) and those free from dental caries to group Healthy (n = 82). The amount of salivary soluble CD14 was quantified. Results: Mean salivary soluble CD14 was 28.3 ± 10.8 μg/mL in the Healthy group and 22 ± 9.6 μg/mL in the Decayed group. A hurdle model was applied to the data to estimate both the probability of having carious lesions and their number in relation to sCD14 levels. sCD14 was strongly associated (p < 0.01) with an inverse relation to both the probability of having caries and their number (falling rate of 5% per unit CD14 μg/mL). Conclusions: This data confirms the relationship between sCD14 and the presence of dental caries. However, there is no clear cut off level between healthy and unhealthy subjects, so it is currently not possible to use sCD14 as a biomarker to determine the risk of decays.","Pellegrini, Gaia; Maddalone, Marcello; Malvezzi, Matteo; Toma, Marilisa; Del Fabbro, Massimo; Canciani, Elena; Dellavia, Claudia",Children (Basel),213,20

IMMUNOLOGICAL BASIS OF COVID-19-ASSOCIATED IMMUNE RESPONSE AND CONVALESCENT PLASMA AS A TREATMENT OPTION: Since it has been shown that the impaired immune response of the host is one of the most important factors that increase the severity of the infection, treatment strategies to suppress aberrant immune activation are currently being considered. CP, which is derived from recently recovered patients and contains neutralizing antibodies and many other immunemodulatory substances, seems to be the most convenient strategy to restore normal immune function considering the fast spreading nature of the ongoing pandemic. CONCLUSION: Even though mechanisms of action of plasma therapy are not fully delineated, it was shown that it could lead to a reduction in mortality since other alternatives such as monoclonal antibodies or SARS-CoV-2 hyperimmunoglobulin require much more time and effort to be developed.","SAYINALP, Başak; ÇINAR, Olgu Erkin; HAZNEDAROĞLU, İbrahim Celalettin",Turk J Med Sci,213,20

The pandemic has led to calls for widespread vitamin D supplementation in public. However, evidence supporting the role of vitamin D in the COVID-19 pandemic remains controversial. METHODS: We performed a two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis to analyze the causal effect of the 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] concentration on COVID-19 susceptibility, severity and hospitalization traits by using summary-level GWAS data. The causal associations were estimated with inverse variance weighted (IVW) with fixed effects (IVW-fixed) and random effects (IVW-random), MR-Egger, weighted edian and MR Robust Adjusted Profile Score (MR.RAPS) methods. We further applied the MR Steiger filtering method, MR Pleiotropy RESidual Sum and Outlier (MR-PRESSO) global test and PhenoScanner tool to check and remove single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that were horizontally pleiotropic. RESULTS: We found no evidence to support the causal associations between the serum 25(OH)D concentration and the risk of COVID-19 susceptibility [IVW-fixed: odds ratio (OR) = 0.9049, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.8197–0.9988, p = 0.0473], severity (IVW-fixed: OR = 1.0298, 95% CI 0.7699–1.3775, p = 0.8432) and hospitalized traits (IVW-fixed: OR = 1.0713, 95% CI 0.8819–1.3013, p = 0.4878) using outlier removed sets at a Bonferroni-corrected p threshold of 0.0167. Sensitivity analyses did not reveal any sign of horizontal pleiotropy. CONCLUSIONS: Our MR analysis provided precise evidence that genetically lowered serum 25(OH)D concentrations were not causally associated with COVID-19 susceptibility, severity or hospitalized traits. Our study did not provide evidence assessing the role of vitamin D supplementation during the COVID-19 pandemic. High-quality randomized controlled trials are necessary to explore and define the role of vitamin D supplementation in the prevention and treatment of COVID-19.

Two experiments were conducted to test the possibility that COVID‐19 social distancing enhances the desire for money. Results showed that compared with controls, participants receiving social distancing primes (via recollection of experiences of social distancing or a Chinese glossary‐search task) offered less money in the dictator game, showed lower willingness towards charitable donation (Experiment 1; N = 102), donated less money to a student fund, and rated money as having more importance (Experiment 2; N = 140).

N protein contains three dynamic disordered regions that house putative transiently-helical binding motifs. The two folded domains interact minimally such that full-length N protein is a flexible and multivalent RNA-binding protein. N protein also undergoes liquid-liquid phase separation when mixed with RNA, and polymer theory predicts that the same multivalent interactions that drive phase separation also engender RNA compaction. We offer a simple symmetry-breaking model that provides a plausible route through which single-genome condensation preferentially occurs over phase separation, suggesting that phase separation offers a convenient macroscopic readout of a key nanoscopic interaction.","Cubuk, Jasmine; Alston, Jhullian J.; Incicco, J.

As we are facing the COVID-19 pandemic, the discrimination between these two entities is of paramount importance. In fact, lung cancer patients are at higher risk of complications from SARS-CoV-2. In this study, we aimed to investigate if a deep learning algorithm was able to discriminate between COVID-19 and radiation therapy-related pneumonitis (RP). The algorithm showed high sensitivity but low specificity in the detection of RP against COVID-19 pneumonia (sensitivity = 97.0%, specificity = 2%, area under the curve (AUC = 0.72). The specificity increased when an estimated COVID-19 risk probability cut-off of 30% was applied (sensitivity 76%, specificity 63%, AUC = 0.84). ABSTRACT: (1) Aim: To test the performance of a deep learning algorithm in discriminating radiation therapy-related pneumonitis (RP) from COVID-19 pneumonia. (2) Methods: In this retrospective study, we enrolled three groups of subjects: pneumonia-free (control group), COVID-19 pneumonia and RP patients. CT images were analyzed by mean of an artificial intelligence (AI) algorithm based on a novel deep convolutional neural network structure. The cut-off value of risk probability of COVID-19 was 30%; values higher than 30% were classified as COVID-19 High Risk, and values below 30% as COVID-19 Low Risk. The statistical analysis included the Mann–Whitney U test (significance threshold at p < 0.05) and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, with fitting performed using the maximum likelihood fit of a binormal model. (3) Results: Most patients presenting RP (66.7%) were classified by the algorithm as COVID-19 Low Risk. The algorithm showed high sensitivity but low specificity in the detection of RP against COVID-19 pneumonia (sensitivity = 97.0%, specificity = 2%, area under the curve (AUC = 0.72). The specificity increased when an estimated COVID-19 risk probability cut-off of 30% was applied (sensitivity 76%, specificity 63%, AUC = 0.84).

However, the implications of telemedicine on patient‐physician interaction, patient satisfaction, and absence of the personal touch have not been studied to date. Following the spread of COVID‐19, telemedicine services were rapidly incorporated at the Oncology Division of Tel Aviv Medical Center. We aimed to evaluate patients' perspectives and preferences regarding telemedicine and to assess whether this virtual communication platform affects the patient‐physician relationship. METHODS: Between March 2020 and May 2020, adult cancer patients who conducted at least one successful telemedicine meeting were interviewed by trained medical personnel. The interview was based on validated patient satisfaction questionnaires and focused on patient‐physician interaction in relation to the last in‐patient visit. RESULTS: Of 236 patients, 172 (74%) patients agreed to participate. The study population comprised mainly patients with gastrointestinal malignancies (n = 79, 46%) with a median age of 63 years (range 21–88). The majority of patients were male (n = 93, 54%). Eighty‐nine (51.7%) patients were receiving active oncologic treatment, and 58 (33.7%) were under routine surveillance following completion of active therapy. Almost all had a sense of secured privacy (n = 171, 96%), the majority of patients affirmed that their concerns were met (n = 166, 93%) and perceived that eye contact with the treating physician was perceived (n = 156, 87%). Only a minority felt that the absence of physical clinic visits harmed their treatment (n = 36, 20%). Most patients (n = 146, 84.9%) wished to continue telemedicine services. A multivariate analysis revealed that higher satisfaction and visits for routine surveillance were both predictors of willingness to continue future telemedicine meetings over physical encounters (odds ratio [OR] = 2.41, p = .01; OR = 3.34, p = .03, respectively). CONCLUSION: Telemedicine is perceived as safe and effective, and patients did not feel that it compromised medical care or the patient‐physician relationship. Integration of telemedicine is ideal for patients under surveillance after completion of active oncologic treatment. Physician communication skills workshops are warranted with implementing this platform.

Despite many potential setbacks, telemedicine has become a useful and safe tool for oncology practitioners to care for their patients. The use of telemedicine regarding patients' perspectives, emotions, and patient‐physician communication in daily oncology practice has not been studied to date. This study demonstrated telemedicine is perceived as safe and effective and does not compromise medical care or the patient‐physician relationship.

Here we adapted a stage-shift model to inform service planning decisions within NHS Scotland for the Detect Cancer Early tumours, breast, colorectal and lung cancer which represent 46% of all cancers diagnosed in Scotland. Methods & Data: Lung, colorectal and breast cancer incidence data for years 2017-18 were obtained from Public Health Scotland Cancer Quality Performance Indicators (QPI), to define a baseline scenario. The most current stage-specific 5-year survival data came from 2009-2014 national cancer registry and South East Scotland Cancer Network (SCAN) QPI audit datasets. The Degeling et al., inverse stage-shift model was adapted to estimate changes in stage at diagnosis, excess mortality and life-years lost from delays to diagnosis and treatment due to Covid-19-related health services disruption. Three and 6-month periods of disruption were simulated to demonstrate the model predictions. Results: Approximately, 1-9% reductions in stage I/II presentations leading up to 2-10% increases in stage III/IV presentations are estimated across the three cancer types. A 6-month period of service disruption is predicted to lead to excess deaths at 5 years of 32.5 (31.1, 33.9) per 1000 cases for lung cancer, 16.5 (7.9, 24.3) for colorectal cancer and 31.6 (28.5, 34.4) for breast cancer. Conclusions: Disruption of cancer diagnostic services can lead to significant excess deaths in following years. Increasing diagnostic and capacity for cancer services to deal with the backlog of care are needed. Real time monitoring of incidence and referral patterns over the disruption and post-disruption period to reduce excess deaths including more rapid incidence data by stage and other key tumour/clinical characteristics at presentation for key cancer cases (on a quarterly basis). Real time monitoring in cancer care and referral patterns should help inform what type of interventions are needed to reduce excess mortality and whether different population subgroups require public health messaging campaigns. Specific mitigation measures can be the subject of additional modelling analysis to assess the benefits and inform service planning decision making.","Figueroa, J.; Gray, E.; Maeda, Y.; Hall, P.

In the present study, a recombinant VSV expressing coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3) major immunogen VP1 has been generated and the immune protection elicited by VSV-VP1 was evaluated. We demonstrated that intranasal delivery of VSV-VP1 can induce a potent antigen-specific mucosal immune response as well as a systemic immune response, particularly the induction of polyfunctional T cells. Importantly, mice immunized with VSV-VP1 were better protected against CVB3-induced viral myocarditis than those receiving a chitosan-formulated DNA vaccine. Increased dendritic cell (DC) maturation in the mesenteric lymph node (MLN) was observed in the mice vaccinated with VSV-VP1, which could be a potential mechanism for the protective immune response.

This study investigates whether modern portable, commercially available air filters reduce the incidence of respiratory infections and/or remove bacteria and viruses from indoor air. We systematically searched Medline, Embase and Cochrane for studies published between January 2000 and September 2020. Studies were eligible for inclusion if they included a portable, commercially available air filter in any indoor setting including care homes, schools or healthcare settings, investigating either associations with incidence of respiratory infections or removal and/or capture of aerosolised bacteria and viruses from the air within the filters. Dual data screening and extraction with narrative synthesis. No studies were found investigating the effects of air filters on the incidence of respiratory infections. Two studies investigated bacterial capture within filters and bacterial load in indoor air. One reported higher numbers of viable bacteria in the HEPA filter than in floor dust samples. The other reported HEPA filtration combined with ultraviolet light reduced bacterial load in the air by 41% (sampling time not reported). Neither paper investigated effects on viruses. There is an important absence of evidence regarding the effectiveness of a potentially cost-efficient intervention for indoor transmission of respiratory infections, including SARS-CoV-2.

METHODS: All patients receiving a primary THA for trauma in four regional hospitals were identified for analysis during the period 1 March to 1 June 2020, which covered the current peak of the COVID-19 pandemic in the UK. RESULTS: Overall, one of 48 patients (2%) contracted COVID-19 during their admission. Although they required a protracted stay in hospital, they did not require ICU treatment. Two patients did require ICU support for medical problems but not relating to COVID-19. Complications were no greater than expected given the short follow-up. There were no mortalities. CONCLUSION: There is a paucity of evidence to guide restarting elective joint arthroplasties following the COVID-19 pandemic. Although THAs for trauma are by no means a perfect surrogate, the results of this study show a low incidence of contracting COVID-19 virus during admission and no significant sequalae during this period.

However, whether and how HBV crosses the placenta to cause infection in utero remains unclear. In this study, we investigate the mechanism as to how the HBV virions pass through layers of the trophoblast. Our data demonstrate the exocytosis of virions from the trophoblast after exposure to HBV where the endocytosed HBV virions co-localized with an S100A10/AnxA2 complex and LC3, an autophagosome membrane marker. Knockdown of either AnxA2 or S100A10 in trophoblast cells led to a reduction of the amount of exo-virus in Transwell assay. Immunohistochemistry also showed a high expression of AnxA2 and S100A10 in the placental tissue samples of HBV-infected mothers with congenital HBV-positive infants (HBV(+/+)). We conclude that in HBV intrauterine infection and mother-to-child transmission, a proportion of HBV hijacks autophagic protein secretion pathway and translocate across the trophoblast via S100A10/AnxA2 complex and multivesicular body (MVB)-mediated exocytosis.

Virtual and simulator-based learning is not widely available in LMIC. It is imperative to analyze feedback of CV fellow-in-training regarding this mode of learning before large scale implementation. METHODOLOGY: This was an observational study conducted between July–August 2020. A multicentered survey was conducted. Survey questionnaire was disseminated to FIT (fellow-in-training) via Google Forms. The questionnaire contained a total of 24 questions about virtual and simulator-based learning during the pandemic. RESULTS: A total of 68 FIT responded to the survey. The mean age was 29.9 years. There were 37% females and 63% males. Majority (75%) agreed that it was easier for them to reach for online sessions than physical sessions. 60% FIT were confident in asking questions or giving comments during the online sessions. 57.4% FIT felt it easier to go through cardiovascular imaging/illustrations via online platforms. 50% (34) were confident that if online sessions had to continue, they would have enough academic learning before they graduated from the program and 54.4% (37) wanted online sessions to continue even beyond the pandemic days. 37.5% (18 out of 48) agreed that the simulator-based teaching was helping them practice skills in times of less clinical exposure. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 pandemic has significantly impacted cardiovascular FIT learning curve because of less hands-on and lack of physical teaching sessions. LMIC have lack of robust e-learning platforms. Virtual learning is convenient for academic learning with growing acceptance amongst fellows. FIT from LMIC are less acquaint to simulator-based teaching and there is a need to invest in simulator-based cardiovascular teaching in LMIC.","Shams, Pirbhat; Ahmed, Intisar; Shahab, Hunaina; Kadani, Zehra; Khan, Aisal; Shams, Marvi; Saeed, Yawer; Bokhari, Saira; Khan, Aamir Hameed",Ann Med Surg (Lond),213,11

The highest sensitivity was reached with electrochemical impedance spectroscopy with the detection limit of 83 pM in solutions of PCA3, while the limits of detection were 2000 pM and 900 pM for cyclic voltammetry and UV-vis spectroscopy, respectively. That detection could be performed with an optical method is encouraging, as one may envisage extending it to colorimetric tests. Since the morphology of sensing units is known to be affected in detection experiments, we applied machine learning algorithms to classify scanning electron microscopy images of the genosensors and managed to distinguish those exposed to PCA3-containing solutions from control measurements with an accuracy of 99.9%.

The study aimed to identify psycho-social factors that predicted distress among Indian population during the spread of novel Coronavirus. METHOD: An online survey was conducted to assess the predictors of distress. A global logistic regression model was built, by identifying significant factors from individual logistic regression models built on various groups of independent variables. The prediction capability of the model was compared with the random forest classifier. RESULTS: The respondents (N = 1060) who are more likely to be distressed, are in the age group of 21-35 years, are females (OR = 1.425), those working on site (OR = 1.592), have pre-existing medical conditions (OR = 1.682), do not have health insurance policy covering COVID-19 (OR = 1.884), have perceived seriousness of COVID-19 (OR = 1.239), have lack of trust in government (OR = 1.246) and whose basic needs’ fulfillment are unsatisfactory (OR = 1.592). The ones who are less likely to be distressed, have higher social support and psychological capital. Random forest classifier correctly classified 2.3% and 17.1% of people under lower and higher distress respectively, with respect to logistic regression.

For example, thoracostomies, tracheotomies and intubations/extubations produce aerosols that can linger in the air. The lingering time is dependent on particle size where, e.g., 500 μm (0.5 mm) particles may quickly fall to the floor, while 1 μm particles may float for extended lengths of time. Here, a method is presented to characterize the size of <40 μm to >600 μm particles resulting from surgery in an operating room (OR). The particles are measured in-situ (next to a patient on an operating table) through a 75mm aperture in a ∼400 mm rectangular enclosure with minimal flow restriction. The particles and gasses exiting a patient are vented through an enclosed laser sheet while a camera captures images of the side-scattered light from the entrained particles. A similar optical configuration was described by Anfinrud et al.; however, we present here an extended method which provides a calibration method for determining particle size. The use of a laser sheet with side-scattered light provides a large FOV and bright image of the particles; however, the particle image dilation caused by scattering does not allow direct measurement of particle size. The calibration routine presented here is accomplished by measuring fixed particle distribution ranges with a calibrated shadow imaging system and mapping these measurements to the in-situ imaging system. The technique used for generating and measuring these particles is described. The result is a three-part process where 1) particles of varying sizes are produced and measured using a calibrated, high-resolution shadow imaging method, 2) the same particle generators are measured with the in-situ imaging system, and 3) a correlation mapping is made between the (dilated) laser image size and the measured particle size. Additionally, experimental and operational details of the imaging system are described such as requirements for the enclosure volume, light management, air filtration and control of various laser reflections. Details related to the OR environment and requirements for achieving close proximity to a patient are discussed as well.","Tkacik, Peter T.; Dahlberg, Jerry L.; Johnson, James E.; Hoth, James J.; Szer, Rebecca A.; Hellman, Samuel E.",PLoS One,213,16

There are three key SARS-CoV-2 enzymes potentially targetable with antivirals: papain-like protease (PLpro), main protease (Mpro), and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. Of these, PLpro is an especially attractive target because it plays an essential role in several viral replication processes, including cleavage and maturation of viral polyproteins, assembly of the replicase-transcriptase complex (RTC), and disruption of host viral response machinery to facilitate viral proliferation and replication. Moreover, this enzyme is conserved across different coronaviruses and promising inhibitors have already been discovered for its SARS-CoV variant. Here we report a substantive body of structural, biochemical, and virus replication studies that identify several inhibitors of the enzyme from SARS-CoV-2 in both wild-type and mutant forms. These efforts include the first structures of wild-type PLpro, the active site C111S mutant, and their complexes with inhibitors, determined at 1.60-2.70 Angstroms. This collection of structures provides fundamental molecular and mechanistic insight to PLpro, and critically, illustrates details for inhibitors recognition and interactions. All presented compounds inhibit the peptidase activity of PLpro in vitro, and some molecules block SARS-CoV-2 replication in cell culture assays.

More specifically, we question the standard assumption in the literature on epidemiological models, where the transmission rate dictating propagation of infections is taken to be proportional to the product between the infected and susceptible sub-populations; a model that relies on strong mixing between the two groups and widespread contact between members of the groups. We content, that contact between infected and susceptible individuals, especially during the early phases of an epidemic, takes place over a (possibly diffused) boundary between the respective sub-populations. As a result, the rate of transmission depends on the product of fractional powers instead. The intuition relies on the fact that infection grows in geographically concentrated cells, in contrast to the standard product model that relies on complete mixing of the susceptible to infected sub-populations. We validate the hypothesis of fractional exponents i) by numerical simulation for disease propagation in graphs imposing a local structure to allowed disease transmissions and ii) by fitting the model to a COVID-19 data set provided by John Hopkins University (JHUCSSE) for the period Jan-31–20 to Mar-24–20, for the countries of Italy, Germany, Iran, and France.","Taghvaei, Amirhossein; Georgiou, Tryphon T.; Norton, Larry; Tannenbaum, Allen",medRxiv,213,23

While antigen detection techniques are widely used in Clinical Microbiology laboratories, for the diagnosis of viruses, some parasites and some bacteria, molecular techniques are routinely used only for some pathogens (such as Clostridium difficile). However, molecular techniques are constantly evolving, and they allow a rapid diagnosis for an increasing number of pathogens, with high sensitivity and specificity. In addition, they are also able to detect virulence factors or resistance mechanisms. Syndromic surveillance systems, which detect different pathogens simultaneously, are very promising because they enable the most frequent pathogens to be diagnosed in a few hours and they can be very useful in certain patients. For the diagnosis of Helicobacter pylori infection, molecular techniques are able to detect bacteria and its resistance to clarithromycin and levofloxacin, allowing the most appropriate treatment to be selected for each patient when bacterial culture is not possible.","Balsalobre-Arenas, Luz; Alarcón-Cavero, Teresa",Enfermedades infecciosas y microbiologia clinica (English ed.),213,2

Dozens of real-time reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) assays have been developed to meet the urgent need of COVID-19 control. However, methodological comparisons among the developed qRT-PCR assays are limited. In the present study, we evaluated the sensitivity, specificity, amplification efficiency, and linear detection ranges of three qRT-PCR assays, including the assays developed by our group (IPBCAMS), and the assays recommended by WHO and China CDC (CCDC). The three qRT-PCR assays exhibited similar sensitivities, with the limit of detection (LOD) at about 10 copies per reaction (except the ORF 1b gene assay in CCDC assays with a LOD at about 100 copies per reaction). No cross reaction with other respiratory viruses were observed in all of the three qRT-PCR assays. Wide linear detection ranges from 106 to 101 copies per reaction and acceptable reproducibility were obtained. By using 25 clinical specimens, the N gene assay of IPBCAMS assays and CCDC assays performed better (with detection rates of 92% and 100%, respectively) than that of the WHO assays (with a detection rate of 60%), and the ORF 1b gene assay in IPBCAMS assays performed better (with a detection rate of 64%) than those of the WHO assays and the CCDC assays (with detection rates of 48% and 20%, respectively). In conclusion, the N gene assays of CCDC assays and IPBCAMS assays and the ORF 1b gene assay of IPBCAMS assays were recommended for qRT-PCR screening of SARS-CoV-2.","Xiao, Yan; Li, Zhen; Wang, Xinming; Wang, Yingying; Wang, Ying; Wang, Geng; Ren, Lili; Li, Jianguo",bioRxiv,213,20

OBJECTIVE: This study’s main objective was to evaluate the impact of vaccine price levels, including payments, and the efficacy levels on COVID-19 vaccine demand. METHODS: Data for this study were collected from an online survey of 2000 US individuals aged 18 years and older, which included a set of contingent valuation questions. Parametric and nonparametric procedures were used to estimate the distribution of willingness-to-pay and willingness-to-accept values for the vaccine and to assess its association with vaccine efficacy levels (50, 70, and 95%). RESULTS: Most of the individuals (60%) indicated they were willing to pay a positive amount for the vaccine; 13.7% said they would only accept the vaccine if it were free; 14.1% were willing to take the vaccine only if they were paid; and 12.2% were not willing to accept the vaccine. The vaccine efficacy level was found to affect an individual’s demand for the vaccine. Estimated mean willingness-to-pay values were: US$594, US$706, and US$723 for vaccines with efficacy levels of 50, 70, and 95%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: US individuals highly value the COVID-19 vaccine, and about 88% of the US population would accept the vaccination; however, 14% indicated they would get vaccinated if compensated. Payments of about US$500 or more would be needed to sufficiently incentivize 50% or more of this group vaccinated.","Carpio, Carlos E.; Coman, Ioana A.; Sarasty, Oscar; García, Manuel",Appl Health Econ Health Policy,213,1

Therapeutic monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) are found to be effective for the management of acute respiratory distress syndrome in patients with COVID-19. In this review, we compiled all therapeutic mAbs targeting cytokine storm, which are in clinical trials for its repurposing in the management of COVID-19. Compilation of clinical trial data indicated that therapeutic monoclonal antibodies targeting interleukins (IL-6, IL-1ra, IL-8, IL-1β, IL-17A, IL-33), interferon-gamma, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, P-selectin, connective tissue growth factor, plasma kallikrein, tumor necrosis factor superfamily 14, granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor, colony stimulating factor 1 receptor, C-C chemokine receptor type 5, cluster of differentiation 14 and 147, vascular endothelial growth factor, programmed cell death protein-1, Angiopoietin - 2, human factor XIIa, complementary protein 5, natural killer cell receptor G2A, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2, immunoglobulin-like transcript 7 receptor, complement component fragment 5a receptor and viral attachment to the human cell were under investigation for management of severely ill patients with COVID-19.

METHODS: The hospital management formed an emergency task force team, whose role was to organize the COVID-19 hospital. The task force used different collaborative channels to redistribute resources and expertise to the hospital. Leading doctors from the departments of infectious diseases, critical care and pulmonology developed standardized guidelines for treatment coherence. Nurses from the infection control team provided regular training on donning and doffing of personal protective equipment and basic safety measures. FINDINGS: Keimyung University Daegu Dongsan hospital became a red zone hospital for COVID-19 patients on 21 February 2020. As of 29 June 2020, 1048 COVID-19 patients had been admitted to the hospital, of which 22 patients died and five patients were still being treated in the recovery ward. A total of 906 health-care personnel worked in the designated hospital, of whom 402 were regular hospital staff and 504 were dispatched health-care workers. Of these health-care workers, only one dispatched nurse acquired COVID-19. On June 15, the hospital management and Daegu city government decided to reconvert the main building to a general hospital for non-COVID-19 patients, while keeping the additional negative pressure rooms available, in case of resurgence of the disease. CONCLUSION: Centralized coordination in frontline hospital operation, staff management, and patient treatment and placement allowed for successful pooling and utilization of medical resources and manpower during the COVID-19 outbreak.","Kim, Mhinjine; Lee, Ji Yeon; Park, Jae Seok; Kim, Hyun Ah; Hyun, Miri; Suh, Young-Sung; Nam, Sung Il; Chung, Woo Jin; Cho, Chi-Heum",Bull World Health Organ,213,18

METHODS: All results from first nasopharyngeal (NP) and oropharyngeal (OP) swabs from unique patients tested via SARS-CoV-2 reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) collected between 1 January and 1 December 2020 predominantly in the Public Health Services regions Kennemerland and Hollands Noorden, province of North Holland, the Netherlands, were included in this study. SARS-CoV-2 PCR crossing-point (Cp)-values were used to estimate viral loads. RESULTS: In total, 278 455 unique patients were tested, of whom 9.1% (n = 25.374) were SARS-CoV-2-positive. PCRs performed by Public Health Services (n = 211 914), in which sampling and inclusion were uniform, revealed a clear relation between age and SARS-CoV-2 viral load, with especially children aged <12 years showing lower viral loads than adults (β: –0.03, 95% confidence interval: –0.03 to –0.02, p < 0.001), independently of sex and/or symptom duration. Interestingly, the median Cp-values between the >79- and <12-year-old populations differed by more than four PCR cycles, suggesting an ∼16-fold difference in viral load. In addition, the proportion of children aged <12 years with a low load (Cp-value >30) was higher compared with other patients (31.1% vs 17.2%, p-value < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: In patients tested by Public Health Services, SARS-CoV-2 viral load increases with age. Further studies should elucidate whether the lower viral load in children is indeed related to their suggested limited role in SARS-CoV-2 transmission. Moreover, as rapid antigen tests are less sensitive than PCR, these results suggest that SARS-CoV-2 antigen tests have lower sensitivity in children than in adults.","Euser, Sjoerd; Aronson, Sem; Manders, Irene; van Lelyveld, Steven; Herpers, Bjorn; Sinnige, Jan; Kalpoe, Jayant; van Gemeren, Claudia; Snijders, Dominic; Jansen, Ruud; Schuurmans Stekhoven, Sophie; van Houten, Marlies; Lede, Ivar; Cohen Stuart, James; Slijkerman Megelink, Fred; Kapteijns, Erik; den Boer, Jeroen; Sanders, Elisabeth; Wagemakers, Alex; Souverein, Dennis",Int J Epidemiol,213,16

During the course of a viral infection, host cells release exosomes and other extracellular vesicles carrying viral and host components that can modulate the immune response. The present study used a shotgun proteomic approach to map the host circulating exosomes’ response to SARS-CoV-2 infection. We investigated how SARS-CoV-2 infection modulates exosome content, exosomes’ involvement in disease progression, and the potential use of plasma exosomes as biomarkers of disease severity. A proteomic analysis of patient-derived exosomes identified several molecules involved in the immune response, inflammation, and activation of the coagulation and complement pathways, which are the main mechanisms of COVID-19–associated tissue damage and multiple organ dysfunctions. In addition, several potential biomarkers—such as fibrinogen, fibronectin, complement C1r subcomponent and serum amyloid P-component—were shown to have a diagnostic feature presenting an area under the curve (AUC) of almost 1. Proteins correlating with disease severity were also detected. Moreover, for the first time, we identified the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the exosomal cargo, which suggests that the virus might use the endocytosis route to spread infection.

This includes ischemic heart disease, arrhythmias, and cardiomyopathies. The common pathophysiological link between SARS-CoV-2 infection and the cardiovascular events is represented by coagulation abnormalities and disruption of factors released by endothelial cells, which contribute in maintaining the blood vessels into an anti-thrombotic state. Thus, early alteration of the functionality of endothelial cells, which may be found soon after SARS-CoV-2 infection, seems to represent the major target of a SARS CoV-2 disease state and accounts for the systemic vascular dysfunction that leads to a detrimental effect in terms of hospitalization and death accompanying the disease. In particular, the molecular interaction of SARS-CoV-2 with the ACE2 receptor located in the endothelial cell surface, either at the pulmonary and systemic level, leads to early impairment of endothelial function, which, in turn, is followed by vascular inflammation and thrombosis of peripheral blood vessels. This highlights systemic hypoxia and further aggravates the vicious circle that compromises the development of the disease, leading to irreversible tissue damage and death of people with SARS CoV-2 infection. The review aims to assess some recent advances to define the crucial role of endothelial dysfunction in the pathogenesis of vascular complications accompanying SARS-CoV-2 infection. In particular, the molecular mechanisms associated with the interaction of SARS CoV-2 with the ACE2 receptor located on the endothelial cells are highlighted to support its role in compromising endothelial cell functionality.

We summarized the evidence on more than 20 identified candidate genes in COVID-19 severity. Predicted deleterious and disruptive genetic variants with possible effects on COVID-19 infectivity have been also summarized. These findings provide novel insights into SARS-CoV-2 biology and infection as well as potential strategies for development of novel COVID therapeutic targets and drug repurposing.","Jahanafrooz, Zohreh; Chen, Zhishan; Bao, Jiandong; Li, Hongzhi; Lipworth, Loren; Guo, Xingyi",Gene,213,24

The present study aimed to investigate perceived stress and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms reported by ICU staff working directly with COVID-19 patients. METHODS: The Perceived Stress Scale was used to assess perceived stress, the PTSD Diagnostic Scale for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (5th edition) was used to determine PTSD symptoms, and a sociodemographic questionnaire was used to record different sociodemographic variables. RESULTS: Altogether, 124 participants (57.2% of whom were men) were included in the analysis. The majority of participants perceived working in the ICU with COVID-19 patients as moderately to severely stressful. Moreover, 71.4% of doctors and 74.4% of nurses experienced moderate-to-severe perceived stress. The staff with previous ICU experience were less likely to have a probable diagnosis of PTSD than those without previous ICU experience. CONCLUSIONS: Assessing perceived stress levels and PTSD among ICU staff may enhance our understanding of COVID-19-induced mental health challenges. Specific strategies to enhance ICU staff’s mental well-being during the COVID-19 pandemic should be employed and monitored regularly. Interventions aimed at alleviating sources of anxiety in a high-stress environment may reduce the likelihood of developing PTSD.","Kader, Nisha; Elhusein, Bushra; Chandrappa, Nirvana Swamy Kudlur; Nashwan, Abdulqadir J.; Chandra, Prem; Khan, Abdul Waheed; Alabdulla, Majid",Ann Gen Psychiatry,213,1

It is essential that people with CF, their families and their clinical teams have the most up-to-date information on the impact of SARS-CoV-2 on their health. This study aims to characterise the impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection in people with CF throughout 2020, identify factors that predict clinical progression of COVID-19, and to describe medium-term follow-up of people who have been infected. Methods: The ‘Cystic Fibrosis Registry Global Harmonization Group’ is a worldwide network of CF Registries that each contributed data on people with CF diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection. In this analysis, we will report on cases contributed from 22 countries diagnosed between 1st February and 13th December 2020. We will present demographic, pre-infection clinical characteristics, symptoms, infection management and outcomes. We will use multivariable logistic regression to assess predictors for hospitalisation with respiratory support and intensive care admission as the outcomes of interest representing clinical progression of COVID-19.

METHODS: A systematic review of reviews was conducted by performing a search on PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Web of Science and Scopus (January 2005 to June 2020) for English-language systematic reviews evaluating HaH. Data on primary outcomes (mortality, readmissions, costs, LOS), secondary outcomes (patient/caregiver outcomes) and process indicators were extracted. Quality of the reviews was assessed using Assessment of Multiple Systematic Reviews-2. There was no registered protocol. RESULTS: Ten systematic reviews were identified (four high quality, five moderate quality and one low quality). The reviews were classified according to three use cases. ESD reviews generally revealed comparable mortality (RR 0.92–1.03) and readmissions (RR 1.09–1.25) to inpatient care, shorter hospital LOS (MD −6.76 to −4.44 days) and unclear findings for costs. AA reviews observed a trend towards lower mortality (RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.54 to 1.09) and costs, and comparable or lower readmissions (RR 0.68–0.98). Among reviews including both programme types (ESD/AA), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease reviews revealed lower mortality (RR 0.65–0.68) and post-HaH readmissions (RR 0.74–0.76) but unclear findings for resource use. CONCLUSION: For suitable patients, HaH generally results in similar or improved clinical outcomes compared with inpatient treatment, and warrants greater attention in health systems facing capacity constraints and rising costs. Preliminary comparisons suggest prioritisation of AA models over ESD due to potential benefits in costs and clinical outcomes. Nonetheless, future research should clarify costs of HaH programmes given the current low-quality evidence, as well as address evidence gaps pertaining to caregiver outcomes and adverse events under HaH care.","Leong, Man Qing; Lim, Cher Wee; Lai, Yi Feng",BMJ Open,213,1

Little information is available on its radiologic manifestations in children. OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study was to characterize the radiographic presentation of children with SARS. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We abstracted data (n=62) on the radiologic appearance and course of SARS in pediatric patients with suspect (n=25) or probable (n=37) SARS, diagnosed in five hospital sites located in three cities: Toronto, Singapore, and Hong Kong. Available chest radiographs and thoracic CTs were reviewed for the presence of the following radiographic findings: airspace disease, air bronchograms, airways inflammation and peribronchial thickening, interstitial disease, pleural effusion, and hilar adenopathy. RESULTS: A total of 62 patients (suspect=25, probable=37) were evaluated for SARS. Patient ages ranged from 5.5 months to 17 years and 11.5 months (average, 6 years and 10 months) with a female-to-male ratio of 32:30. Forty-one patients (66.1%) were in close contact with other probable, suspect, or quarantined cases; 10 patients (16.1%) had recently traveled to WHO-designated affected areas within 10 days; and 7 patients (11.2%) were transferred from other hospitals that had SARS patients. Three patients, who did not have close/hospital contact or travel history to affected areas, were classified as SARS cases based on their clinical signs and symptoms and on the fact that they were living in an endemic area. The most prominent clinical presentations were fever, with a temperature over 38 °C (100%), cough (62.9%), rhinorrhea (22.6%), myalgia (17.7%), chills (14.5%), and headache (11.3%). Other findings included sore throat (9.7%), gastrointestinal symptoms (9.7%), rigor (8.1%), and lethargy (6.5%). In general, fever and cough were the most common clinical presentations amongst younger pediatric SARS cases (age<10 years), whereas, in addition to these symptoms, headache, myalgia, sore throat, chills, and/or rigor were common in older patients (age≥10 years). The chest radiographs of 35.5% of patients were normal. The most prominent radiological findings that were observed in the remaining patients were areas of consolidation (45.2%), often peripheral with multifocal lesions in 22.6%. Peribronchial thickening was noted on chest radiographs of 14.5% of patients. Pleural effusion was observed only in one patient (age 17 years and 11.5 months), whereas interstitial disease was not observed in any patient. CONCLUSION: In pediatric cases, SARS manifests with nonspecific radiographic features making radiological differentiation difficult, especially from other commonly encountered childhood respiratory viral illnesses causing airspace disease. The radiographic presentation of suspected SARS cases ranged from normal to mild perihilar peribronchial thickening. The radiographic presentations, as expected, were relatively more pronounced in the SARS probable cases.","Babyn, Paul S.; Chu, Winnie C. W.; Tsou, Ian Y. Y.; Wansaicheong, Gervais K.

Whether disease modifying therapies (DMTs) for multiple sclerosis (MS) also impact T cell immune response to vaccination is unknown. METHODS: In 101 people with MS, we measured humoral responses via an immunoassay to measure IgG against the COVID-19 spike S1 glycoprotein in serum. We also measured T cell responses using FluoroSpot assay for interferon gamma (IFN-γ) (Mabtech, Sweden) using cryopreserved rested PBMCs and then incubated in cRPMI with 1μg/ml of pooled peptides spanning the entire spike glycoprotein (Genscript, 2 pools; 158 peptides each). Plates were read on an AID iSpot Spectrum to determine number of spot forming cells (SFC)/10(6) PBMCs. We tested for differences in immune responses across DMTs using linear models. FINDINGS: Humoral responses were detected in 22/39 (56.4%) participants on anti-CD20 and in 59/63 (93.6%) participants on no or other DMTs. In a subset with immune cell phenotyping (n=88; 87%), T cell responses were detected in 76/88 (86%), including 32/33 (96.9%) participants on anti-CD20 therapies. AntiCD20 therapies were associated with an increase in IFN-γ SFC counts relative to those on no DMT or other DMTs (for antiCD20 vs. no DMT: 425.9% higher [95%CI: 109.6%, 1206.6%] higher; p<0.001; for antiCD20 vs. other DMTs: 289.6% [95%CI: 85.9%, 716.6%] higher; p<0.001). INTERPRETATION: We identified a robust T cell response in individuals on anti-CD20 therapies despite a reduced humoral response to SARS-CoV-2 vaccination. Follow up studies are needed to determine if this translates to protection against COVID-19 infection.","Gadani, Sachin P.; Reyes-Mantilla, Maria; Jank, Larissa; Harris, Samantha; Douglas, Morgan; Smith, Matthew D.; Calabresi, Peter A.; Mowry, Ellen M.; Fitzgerald, Kathryn C.; Bhargava, Pavan",medRxiv,213,16

The pandemic surge and resultant lockdown have affected the standard-of-care of many medical conditions and diseases. The initial uncertainty and fear of cross transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) have changed the routine management of patients with pre-existing liver diseases, hepatocellular carcinoma, and patients either listed for or received a liver transplant. COVID-19 is best described as a multisystem disease caused by SARS-CoV-2, and it can cause acute liver injury or decompensation of the pre-existing liver disease. There has been considerable research on the pathophysiology, infection transmission, and treatment of COVID-19 in the last few months. The pathogenesis of liver involvement in COVID-19 includes viral cytotoxicity, the secondary effect of immune dysregulation, hypoxia resulting from respiratory failure, ischemic damage caused by vascular endotheliitis, congestion because of right heart failure, or drug-induced liver injury. Patients with chronic liver diseases, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma are at high risk for severe COVID-19 and mortality. The phase III trials of recently approved vaccines for SARS-CoV-2 did not include enough patients with pre-existing liver diseases and excluded immunocompromised patients or those on immunomodulators.

Neutrophilia and high levels of proinflammatory cytokines and other mediators of inflammation are common finds in patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome due to COVID-19. By its action on leukocytes, we propose colchicine as an intervention worthy of being tested. Objective. To evaluate whether the addition of colchicine to standard treatment for COVID-19 results in better outcomes. Methods. We present the interim analysis of a single-center randomized, double-blinded, placebo controlled clinical trial of colchicine for the treatment of moderate to severe COVID-19, with 38 patients allocated 1:1 from April 11 to July 06, 2020. Colchicine regimen was 0.5 mg thrice daily for 5 days, then 0.5 mg twice daily for 5 days. The first dose was 1.0 mg whether body weight was [≥] 80 kg. Endpoints. The primary endpoints were the need for supplemental oxygen; time of hospitalization; need for admission and length of stay in intensive care units; and death rate and causes of mortality. As secondary endpoints, we assessed: serum C-reactive protein, serum Lactate dehydrogenase and relation neutrophil to lymphocyte of peripheral blood samples from day zero to day 7; the number, type, and severity of adverse events; frequency of interruption of the study protocol due to adverse events; and frequency of QT interval above 450 ms. Results. Thirty-five patients (18 for Placebo and 17 for Colchicine) completed the study. Both groups were comparable in terms of demographic, clinical and laboratory data at baseline. Median (and interquartile range) time of need for supplemental oxygen was 3.0 (1.5-6.5) days for the Colchicine group and 7.0 (3.0-8.5) days for Placebo group (p = 0.02). Median (IQR) time of hospitalization was 6.0 (4.0-8.5) days for the Colchicine group and 8.5 (5.5-11.0) days for Placebo group (p = 0.03). At day 2, 53% vs 83% of patients maintained the need for supplemental oxygen, while at day 7 the values were 6% vs 39%, in the Colchicine and Placebo groups, respectively (log rank; p = 0.01). Hospitalization was maintained for 53% vs 78% of patients at day 5 and 6% vs 17% at day 10, for the Colchicine and Placebo groups, respectively (log rank; p = 0.01). One patient per group needed admission to ICU. No recruited patient died. At day 4, patients of Colchicine group presented significant reduction of serum C-reactive protein compared to baseline (p < 0.001). The majority of adverse events were mild and did not lead to patient withdrawal. Diarrhea was more frequent in the Colchicine group (p = 0.17). Cardiac adverse events were absent. Discussion. The use of colchicine reduced the length of supplemental oxygen therapy and the length of hospitalization. Clinical improvement was in parallel with a reduction on serum levels of C-reactive protein. The drug was safe and well tolerated. Colchicine may be considered a beneficial and not expensive option for COVID-19 treatment. Clinical trials with larger numbers of patients should be conducted to further evaluate the efficacy and safety of colchicine as an adjunctive therapy for hospitalized patients with moderate to severe COVID-19.","Lopes, M.

Infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) is one of the most important infectious agents in chickens, and in chicken cells, it can be recognized by MDA5 to activate interferon production. RIG-I is considered to be absent in chickens. However, the absence of RIG-I in chickens raises the question of whether this protein influences the antiviral immune response against IBV infection. RESULTS: Here, we showed that chicken cells transfected with domestic goose RIG-I (dgRIG-I) exhibited increased IFN-β activity after IBV infection. We also found that IBV can cleave MAVS, an adaptor protein downstream of RIG-I and MDA5 that acts as a platform for antiviral innate immunity at an early stage of infection. CONCLUSIONS: Although chicken MDA5 (chMDA5) is functionally active during IBV infection, the absence of RIG-I may increase the susceptibility of chickens to IBV infection, and IBV may disrupt the activation of the host antiviral response through the cleavage of MAVS.

It has been well documented that the severity of the disease and disease related mortality is strongly correlated with age and the presence of co-morbidities. We incorporate this in our model by considering two susceptible classes, a high risk, and a low risk group. Disease transmission within each group is modelled by an extension of the SEIR model, considering additional compartments for quarantined and treated population groups first and vaccinated and treated population groups next. Cross Infection across the high and low risk groups is also incorporated in the model. We calculate the basic reproduction number [Image: see text] and show that for [Image: see text] the disease dies out, and for [Image: see text] the disease is endemic. We note that varying the relative proportion of high and low risk susceptibles has a strong effect on the disease burden and mortality. We devise optimal medication and vaccination strategies for effective control of the disease. Our analysis shows that vaccinating and medicating both groups is needed for effective disease control and the controls are not very sensitive to the proportion of the high and low risk populations.","Khan, Adnan; Ali, Mohsin; Iqbal, Wizda; Imran, Mudassar",PLoS One,213,1

DESIGN: Multi-center retrospective cohort study. SETTING: Twenty-eight hospitals located in eight provinces of China. METHODS: A total of 432 survivors with laboratory-confirmed SARS CoV-2 infection participated in this study. At discharge, we assessed instrumental activities of daily living (IADL) with Lawton’s IADL scale, dependence in activities of daily living (ADL) with the Barthel Index, and anxiety with Zung’s self-reported anxiety scale. Exposures included comorbidity, smoking, setting (Hubei vs. others), disease severity, symptoms, and length of hospital stay. Other risk factors considered were age, gender, and ethnicity (Han vs. Tibetan). RESULTS: Prevalence of at least one IADL problem was 36.81% (95% CI: 32.39–41.46). ADL dependence was present in 16.44% (95% CI: 13.23–20.23) and 28.70% (95% CI: 24.63–33.15) were screened positive for clinical anxiety.

However, much of the research in this area to date is limited by factors like small sample sizes and convenience sampling. The objective of this study was to assess sociodemographic and health disparities among two- and four-year post-secondary students screening positive for food insecurity, using one of the largest relevant health surveillance databases available. This study included analyses of pooled annual data (2015–2018; n = 13,720) from students participating in state-based surveillance of 27 two- and four-year Minnesota post-secondary institutions. Food security was determined using a validated two-item screener. Disparities were examined across numerous factors including: sociodemographic, economic, academic, institutional, nutrition and weight-related health risk and resiliency. In total, 24% of students experienced food insecurity. Findings highlighted stark disparities, with notably high positive screening rates of food insecurity among non-Hispanic Black (43%), transgender/non-binary (42%) and first-generation (33%) students. Food insecurity was significantly associated with nearly every adverse health factor examined, despite controlling for demographics (p < 0.0001). Overall, these findings represent one of the largest peer-reviewed studies of college food insecurity to date and underscore robust differences between who experiences food insecurity and who does not. They also highlight troubling health risks that accompany food insecurity. Importantly, the COVID-19 pandemic has worsened these realities. To inform prevention efforts, additional research is urgently needed, including cohort studies, controlled trials, and quasi-experimental research based on rigorous evaluation of policy initiatives now being considered at institutional, state and federal levels.","Laska, Melissa N.; Lenk, Kathleen; Lust, Katherine; McGuire, Cydney M.; Porta, Carolyn M.; Stebleton, Michael",Prev Med Rep,213,8

The current study set‐out to model the complex interrelations between PTSD symptoms during the peak of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 outbreak in 291 Chinese healthcare workers and 291 matched control cases that were selected from the general population. For this purpose, we estimated regularized partial correlation networks. Within the network of healthcare workers, we observed a central role for avoidance of reminders of the traumatic event, physiological cue reactivity, anger/irritability, re‐experiencing, and startle. We identified three clusters of closely interconnected PTSD symptoms in healthcare workers, consisting of (a) symptoms of re‐experiencing and anxious arousal, (b) symptoms of avoidance and amnesia and (c) symptoms of emotional numbing and dysphoric arousal. Respectively, startle, avoidance of reminders and feeling detached emerged as bridging nodes in these communities. Although yielding highly similar network models, the PTSD symptom structure of healthcare workers showed several unique features compared to the matched control sample. This is informative for interventions aimed at targeting PTSD symptoms in healthcare workers in the context of a public health emergency.","Hoorelbeke, Kristof; Sun, Xiaoxiao; Koster, Ernst H.

However, there is a lack of regarding comprehensive stroke phenotype and characteristics Methods: We conducted a multinational observational study on features of consecutive acute ischemic stroke (AIS), intracranial hemorrhage (ICH), and cerebral venous or sinus thrombosis (CVST) among SARS-CoV-2 infected patients. We further investigated the association of demographics, clinical data, geographical regions, and countrie's health expenditure among AIS patients with the risk of large vessel occlusion (LVO), stroke severity as measured by National Institute of Health stroke scale (NIHSS), and stroke subtype as measured by the TOAST criteria. Additionally, we applied unsupervised machine learning algorithms to uncover possible similarities among stroke patients. Results: Among the 136 tertiary centers of 32 countries who participated in this study, 71 centers from 17 countries had at least one eligible stroke patient. Out of 432 patients included, 323(74.8%) had AIS, 91(21.1%) ICH, and 18(4.2%) CVST. Among 23 patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage, 16(69.5%) had no evidence of aneurysm. A total of 183(42.4%) patients were women, 104(24.1%) patients were younger than 55 years, and 105(24.4%) patients had no identifiable vascular risk factors. Among 380 patients who had known interval onset of the SARS-CoV-2 and stroke, 144(37.8%) presented to the hospital with chief complaints of stroke-related symptoms, with asymptomatic or undiagnosed SARS-CoV-2 infection. Among AIS patients 44.5% had LVO; 10% had small artery occlusion according to the TOAST criteria. We observed a lower median NIHSS (8[3-17], versus 11[5-17]; p=0.02) and higher rate of mechanical thrombectomy (12.4% versus 2%; p<0.001) in countries with middle to high-health expenditure when compared to countries with lower health expenditure. The unsupervised machine learning identified 4 subgroups, with a relatively large group with no or limited comorbidities. Conclusions: We observed a relatively high number of young, and asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections among stroke patients. Traditional vascular risk factors were absent among a relatively large cohort of patients. Among hospitalized patients, the stroke severity was lower and rate of mechanical thrombectomy was higher among countries with middle to high-health expenditure.","Shahjouei, S.; Tsivgoulis, G.; Arora, R.; Harirchian, M.

The goal of this study is to evaluate fear of relapse, social support, and psychological well-being (depression, anxiety, and stress level) of Iranian patients with MS during the COVID-19 pandemic stage. METHODS: One hundred and sixty-five patients were enrolled. We asked all cases to fill valid and reliable Persian version of depression, anxiety, and stress scale (DASS-21), perceived social support, and fear of relapse scale questionnaires. RESULTS: One hundred and sixty-five patients were enrolled. Female to male ratio was (F/M) = 4.6. Mean age and mean duration of disease were 35.3±8.6 and 7.1±5 years, respectively. Mean scores of social support, DASS, and FoR questionnaires were 63.1±16.8, 16.4±13.4, and 51.4±17.3, respectively. There was a significant negative correlation between social support and FoR scores and also significant positive correlations between components of DASS and FoR. Linear regression analysis by considering FoR as dependent variable and age, sex, marital status, duration of the disease, and EDSS as dependent variables showed that sex was an independent predictor of FoR score.

If the virus enters a feed mill, it becomes widely distributed and is difficult to decontaminate from both feed contact and non-feed contact surfaces. The objective of this study was to evaluate a variety of liquid and dry decontamination treatments that could be used to reduce the amount of PEDV found on feed manufacturing surfaces. This experiment was designed as a 5 × 10 factorial with five different feed manufacturing surfaces and 10 decontamination treatments with three replicates of each combination. Surfaces included stainless steel, solid polyethylene, woven polypropylene tote bag, rubber, and sealed concrete coupons. One mL (1×10(5) TCID(50)/mL) of stock PEDV was applied to each surface and allowed to dry completely for 60 min. Next, for decontamination requiring surface application, the application was performed and allowed 15 min contact time. The quantity of PEDV RNA was determined using quantitative reverse transcription PCR. A decontamination treatment × surface interaction was observed (P < 0.0001), indicating the efficacy of treatment is dependent upon the surface in which it is applied. Within the cement surfaces, the sodium hypochlorite resulted in the greatest (P < 0.05) cycle threshold (Ct) value, followed by formaldehyde which had a greater (P < 0.05) Ct value compared to remaining treatments. Within polyethylene, rubber, and stainless steel surfaces, the formaldehyde treated surfaces had the greatest Ct values (P < 0.05), followed by the sodium hypochlorite treatment, with other treatments all having lower Ct values (P < 0.05). For the woven polyethylene surfaces, the formaldehyde and sodium hypochlorite treatments had greater Ct values compared to all other treatments (P < 0.05). Additional research is necessary to identify the role of decontamination treatment on PEDV infectivity and develop methods for decontamination of feed manufacturing facilities.","Muckey, Mary B; Jones, Cassandra K; Woodworth, Jason C; Paulk, Chad B; Dritz, Steve S; Gebhardt, Jordan T",Transl Anim Sci,213,20

During lung development, distal lung fibroblasts, in the form of matrix‐, myo‐, and lipofibroblasts, form the extra cellular matrix (ECM), create tensile strength, and support distal epithelial differentiation, respectively. During de novo septation in a murine pneumonectomy lung regeneration model, developmental processes are reactivated within the iReFs, indicating progenitor function well into adulthood. In contrast to the regenerative activation of fibroblasts upon acute injury, chronic injury results in fibrotic activation. In murine lung fibrosis models, fibroblasts can pathologically differentiate into lineages beyond their normal commitment during homeostasis. In lung injury, recently defined alveolar niche cells support the expansion of alveolar epithelial progenitors to regenerate the epithelium. In human fibrotic lung diseases like bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), dynamic changes in matrix‐, myo‐, lipofibroblasts, and alveolar niche cells suggest differential requirements for injury pathogenesis and repair. In this review, we summarize the role of alveolar fibroblasts and their activation stage in alveolar septation and regeneration and incorporate them into the context of human lung disease, discussing fibroblast activation stages and how they contribute to BPD, IPF, and COPD.","Ushakumary, Mereena George; Riccetti, Matthew; Perl, Anne‐Karina T.",Stem Cells Transl Med,213,32

While general guidance has been issued for the responsible conduct of research in these challenging circumstances, the contours of the dueling COVID-19 and HIV/AIDS pandemics raise some critical ethical issues for HIV prevention research. In this paper, we use the recently updated HIV Prevention Trials Network (HPTN) Ethics Guidance Document (EGD) to situate and analyze key ethical challenges related to the conduct of HIV prevention research during the COVID-19 pandemic as well as identify potential areas for refinement of the guidance document based on this unprecedented state of affairs. MAIN BODY: Necessary actions taken for HIV prevention research studies due to the COVID-19 pandemic involve an array of ethical issues including those related to: (1) risk mitigation; (2) behavior change; (3) compounding vulnerability; (4) community engagement; (5) trial reopening; and 6) shifting research priorities. CONCLUSIONS: In the context of the dueling HIV and COVID-19 global pandemics, research teams and sponsors must be nimble in responding to the rapidly changing environment by being sensitive to the associated ethical issues. The HTPN EGD provides a rich set of tools to help identify, analyze and address many of these issues. At the same time, future refinements of the HPTN EGD and other research ethics guidance could be strengthened by providing explicit advice regarding the ethical issues associated with disrupted research and the reopening of studies. In addition, additional consideration should be given to appropriately balancing domains of risk (e.g., physical versus social), addressing the vulnerability of research staff and community partners, and responding to un-anticipatable ancillary care needs of participants and communities. Appropriately addressing these issues will necessitate conceptual work, which would benefit from the careful documentation of the actual ethical issues encountered in research, the strategies implemented to overcome them, and their success in doing so. Throughout all of these efforts, it is critical to remember that the HIV pandemic not be forgotten in the rush to deal with the COVID-19 pandemic.","Rennie, Stuart; Chege, Wairimu; Schrumpf, Leah A.; Luna, Florencia; Klitzman, Robert; Moseki, Ernest; Brown, Brandon; Wakefield, Steven; Sugarman, Jeremy",BMC Med Ethics,213,5

These populations have experienced higher rates of infection and mortality compared with the non-Hispanic White (White) population (1-5) and greater excess mortality (i.e., the percentage increase in the number of persons who have died relative to the expected number of deaths for a given place and time) (6). A limitation of existing research on excess mortality among racial/ethnic minority groups has been the lack of adjustment for age and population change over time. This study assessed excess mortality incidence rates (IRs) (e.g., the number of excess deaths per 100,000 person-years) in the United States during December 29, 2019-January 2, 2021, by race/ethnicity and age group using data from the National Vital Statistics System. Among all assessed racial/ethnic groups (non-Hispanic Asian [Asian], AI/AN, Black, Hispanic, NH/PI, and White populations), excess mortality IRs were higher among persons aged ≥65 years (426.4 to 1033.5 excess deaths per 100,000 person-years) than among those aged 25-64 years (30.2 to 221.1) and those aged <25 years (-2.9 to 14.1).

During the period from 2/4/2020 to 18/5/2020, a total of 219 blood samples were collected and analyzed for the presence of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. Collection of samples were divided in two categories; random samples from public community and samples from health care workers belong to two Governmental hospitals and one private clinic. One Step Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) IgM/IgG Antibody Test was used. Out of the 219 samples tested, 6 (2.74%) samples were seropositive for SARS-CoV-2. All health-care workers were tested negative. All positive cases were females and 5 of them aged between 44 to 75 years and one aged 32 years. The prevalence in young females ([≤]40 years) was 1.4% in total young females tested in the study and 1.75% in young females taken from public community. The prevalence in older females aged ( 40 years), was 11.1% in total females tested and 13.9% in females taken from public community. In conclusion, the preliminary investigation of SARS-CoV-2 revealed considerable prevalence in Alzintan City although the disease seems to be in its mild form.

METHODS: Evaluation of cause, clinical symptoms, and treatment response. RESULTS: A 59-year-old woman with a background of transfusion-dependent aplastic anemia presented with seizures and reduced level of consciousness 10 days after the onset of subjective fever, cough, and headache. Nasopharyngeal swab testing for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) was positive, and CT during admission demonstrated diffuse swelling of the brain stem.

Good hygiene practices were considered an effective prevention method, but there were only minimal data on the effectiveness of hygiene practices against the pandemic at the community level. Thus, this study aims to assess hygiene practices in society by using a community-based survey. A cross-sectional study using survey monkey was conducted from December 2019 to February 2020. The Snowball sampling technique was used to recruit participants and exploratory factor analysis was applied to scrutinize the construct validity of the measurement. We used the Tobit regression model to assess the association. Hygiene in a high-risk environment and hygiene in the social and educational environment were two main factors after applying the EFA method. Participants grade community sanitation quite low (around 6 out of 10). Furthermore, the mean score of hygiene practice at a local level in a high-risk environment was slightly low at 6.0. The score of sanitation in the Central region (5.3) was quite low compared to the North (5.8) and the South (6.2). The most high-risk environment was construction, industrial zone and food safety. Moreover, younger respondents were more likely to report poorer hygiene practices in high-risk environments (Coefficient = −1.67; 95% CI = −3.03; −0.32) and social and educational environment (Coefficient = −1.29; 95% CI = −2.54; −0.04). Our study gives an insight into pandemic preparedness at the grassroots level. The findings suggest the necessity of specific communication education for society to improve the compliance of hygiene practices to prevent the spreading of COVID-19.","Nguyen, Trang Huyen Thi; Le, Huong Thi; Le, Xuan Thi Thanh; Do, Toan Thanh Thi; Ngo, Toan Van; Phan, Hai Thanh; Vu, Giang Thu; Nguyen, Tu Huu; Phung, Dung Tri; Nghiem, Son Hong; Vu, Thuc Minh Thi; Nguyen, Thu Ha; Tran, Trung Dinh; Do, Khanh Nam; Truong, Dat Van; Le, Thanh Tuan; Tran, Bach Xuan; Latkin, Carl A.; Ho, Roger C.

We explored the impact of myCOPD in patients with mild–moderate or recently diagnosed COPD through a 12-week, open-label, parallel-group, randomised controlled trial of myCOPD compared with usual care. The co-primary outcomes were between-group differences in mean COPD assessment test (CAT) score at 90 days and critical inhaler errors. Key secondary outcomes were app usage and patient activation measurement (PAM) score. Sixty patients were randomised (29 myCOPD, 31 usual care). Groups were balanced for forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV(1) % pred) but there was baseline imbalance between groups for exacerbation frequency and CAT score. There was no significant adjusted mean difference in CAT score at study completion, −1.27 (95% CI −4.47–1.92, p=0.44) lower in myCOPD. However, an increase in app use was associated with greater CAT score improvement. The odds of ≥1 critical inhaler error was lower in the myCOPD arm (adjusted OR 0.30 (95% CI 0.09–1.06, p=0.061)). The adjusted odds ratio for being in a higher PAM level at 90 days was 1.65 (95% CI 0.46–5.85) in favour of myCOPD.

For protein evolution, this order is often determined by first arranging sequences into a phylogenetic tree, which has limiting assumptions and can suffer from substantial ambiguity. Here, we demonstrate how machine learning algorithms called language models can learn mutational likelihoods that predict the directionality of evolution, thereby enabling phylogenetic analysis that addresses key limitations of existing methods. Our main conceptual advance is to construct a “vector field” of protein evolution through local evolutionary predictions that we refer to as evolutionary velocity (evo-velocity). We show that evo-velocity can successfully predict evolutionary order at vastly different timescales, from viral proteins evolving over years to eukaryotic proteins evolving over geologic eons.

PEDV and the Stockholm agent appeared identical concerning pathogenic and immunogenic properties by infection experiments and protection tests in rabbits. Two of the three PEDV isolates were less pathogenic but appeared immunogenically identical to PEDV. The third isolate, obtained from the laboratory, which several years previously had supplied material for demonstration of the Stockholm agent, differed from PEDV in pathogenic and immunogenic properties. Serological examinations of paired rabbit sera did not indicate any antigenic relationship between PEDV and representative members of the two mammalian coronavirus antigenic groups. It is concluded that the aetiological agent of PED is a virus not belonging to the coronaviridae.","Fennestad, K. L.; MacNaughton, M. R.",Arch Virol,213,26

Drawing upon previous findings and employing a life history framework, this paper proposed that the increase in procrastination may be attributed to the heightened levels of uncertainty in the pandemic. Additionally, this paper examined life history strategy as the psychological mechanism underlying the relation between uncertainty and procrastination. By collecting data across two school semesters in a university (N = 253), we found that uncertainty and procrastination did not differ between the semester where changes were abruptly imposed to stem the spread of COVID-19 and the following semester. Our findings also revealed that uncertainty predicted procrastination, and that life history strategy mediated the relation between uncertainty and procrastination. Specifically, uncertainty was associated with a faster life history strategy, which was positively associated with procrastination. By shedding light on the psychology behind the effect of uncertainty on procrastination, the findings of this paper hold important implications for the design of procrastination interventions for the uncertain climate during the pandemic and “the new normal” post COVID-19.","Lim, Amy J.; Javadpour, Sasha",Front Psychol,213,22

Understanding the distribution of disease at the national level contributes to the formulation of public health policies. There are several studies that investigating the influencing factors on distribution of COVID-19 in China. However, more influencing factors need to be considered to improve our understanding about the current epidemic. Moreover, in the absence of effective medicine or vaccine, the Chinese government introduced a series of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs). However, assessing and predicting the effectiveness of these interventions requires further study. In this paper, we used statistical techniques, correlation analysis and GIS mapping expression method to analyze the spatial and temporal distribution characteristics and the influencing factors of the COVID-19 in mainland China. The results showed that the spread of outbreaks in China’s non-Hubei provinces can be divided into five stages. Stage I is the initial phase of the COVID-19 outbreak; in stage II the new peak of the epidemic was observed; in stage III the outbreak was contained and new cases decreased; there was a rebound in stage IV, and stage V led to level off. Moreover, the cumulative confirmed cases were mainly concentrated in the southeastern part of China, and the epidemic in the cities with large population flows from Wuhan was more serious. In addition, statistically significant correlations were found between the prevalence of the epidemic and the temperature, rainfall and relative humidity. To evaluate the NPIs, we simulated the prevalence of the COVID-19 based on an improved SIR model and under different prevention intensity. It was found that our simulation results were compatible with the observed values and the parameter of the time function in the improved SIR model for China is a = − 0.0058. The findings and methods of this study can be effective for predicting and managing the epidemics and can be used as an aid for decision makers to control the current and future epidemics.","Chen, Youliang; Li, Qun; Karimian, Hamed; Chen, Xunjun; Li, Xiaoming",Sci Rep,213,27

Increased research on diagnostic tools is currently being implemented in order to assist with rapid identification of the virus, as mass diagnosis and containment is the best way to prevent the outbreak of the virus. Accordingly, there is a growing urgency to establish a point-of-care device for the rapid detection of coronavirus to prevent subsequent spread. This device needs to be sensitive, selective, and exhibit rapid diagnostic capabilities. Electrochemical biosensors have demonstrated these traits and, hence, serve as promising candidates for the detection of viruses. This review summarizes the designs and features of electrochemical biosensors developed for some past and current pandemic or epidemic viruses, including influenza, HIV, Ebola, and Zika. Alongside the design, this review also discusses the detection principles, fabrication techniques, and applications of the biosensors.

This study aimed to determine a pre-test probability score for SARS-CoV-2 infection. METHODS: This multicenter retrospective study (4 University Hospitals) included patients with clinical suspicion of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Demographic characteristics, clinical symptoms, and results of blood tests (complete white blood cell count, serum electrolytes and CRP) were collected. A pre-test probability score was derived from univariate analyses of clinical and biological variables between patients and controls, followed by multivariate binary logistic analysis to determine the independent variables associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection. RESULTS: 605 patients were included between March 10(th) and April 30(th), 2020 (200 patients for the training cohort, 405 consecutive patients for the validation cohort). In the multivariate analysis, lymphocyte (<1.3 G/L), eosinophil (<0.06 G/L), basophil (<0.04 G/L) and neutrophil counts (<5 G/L) were associated with high probability of SARS-CoV-2 infection but no clinical variable was statistically significant. The score had a good performance in the validation cohort (AUC = 0.918 (CI: [0.891–0.946]; STD = 0.014) with a Positive Predictive Value of high-probability score of 93% (95%CI: [0.89–0.96]). Furthermore, a low-probability score excluded SARS-CoV-2 infection with a Negative Predictive Value of 98% (95%CI: [0.93–0.99]). The performance of the score was stable even during the last period of the study (15-30(th) April) with more controls than infected patients. CONCLUSIONS: The PARIS score has a good performance to categorize the pre-test probability of SARS-CoV-2 infection based on complete white blood cell count.

These policies had significant economic impacts and caused social disruptions. Early re-opening is preferable, but it introduces the risk of a resurgence of the epidemic. Although the World Health Organization has outlined criteria for re-opening, decisions on re-opening are mainly based on epidemiologic criteria. To date, the effectiveness of re-opening policies remains unclear. METHODS: A system dynamics COVID-19 model, SEIHR(Q), was constructed by integrating infection prevention and control measures implemented in Wuhan into the classic SEIR epidemiological model and was validated with real-world data. The input data were obtained from official websites and the published literature. RESULTS: The simulation results showed that track-and-trace measures had significant effects on the level of risk associated with re-opening. In the case of Wuhan, where comprehensive contact tracing was implemented, there would have been almost no risk associated with re-opening. With partial contact tracing, re-opening would have led to a minor second wave of the epidemic. However, if only limited contact tracing had been implemented, a more severe second outbreak of the epidemic would have occurred, overwhelming the available medical resources. If the ability to implement a track-trace-quarantine policy is fixed, the epidemiological criteria need to be further taken into account. The model simulation revealed different levels of risk associated with re-opening under different levels of track-and-trace ability and various epidemiological criteria. A matrix was developed to evaluate the effectiveness of the re-opening policies. CONCLUSIONS: The SEIHR(Q) model designed in this study can quantify the impact of various re-opening policies on the spread of COVID-19. Integrating epidemiologic criteria, the contact tracing policy, and medical resources, the model simulation predicts whether the re-opening policy is likely to lead to a further outbreak of the epidemic and provides evidence-based support for decisions regarding safe re-opening during an ongoing epidemic.

Priapism has previously been described in a single case report as a potential thrombotic complication of severe COVID-19.1 Priapism, the persistence of an erection not associated with sexual desire, mostly commonly results from ischemic (low-flow or veno-occlusive) causes. Medications and blood dyscrasias are among the most common etiologies of ischemic priapism. Here we report a case of priapism in a patient admitted to the medical ICU for ARDS caused by severe COVID-19. CASE PRESENTATION: A 68-year-old man with a past medical history of chronic kidney disease, benign prostatic hyperplasia, and diabetes mellitus presented to the emergency department for worsening dyspnea, nausea and fatigue. He had been diagnosed with COVID-19 eight days prior. On arrival, the patient was profoundly hypoxemic despite being placed on high-flow nasal cannula. He was then intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation. A chest x-ray showed bilateral patchy infiltrates consistent with COVID-19 pneumonia. The patient became hypotensive and was started on vasopressors. His platelet count was normal and he was maintained on heparin subcutaneously three times per day for DVT prophylaxis. On the morning of hospital day seven, it was noted that the patient had a persistent erection for > 4 hours. He had not received any alpha adrenergic antagonist, antipsychotic, or antidepressant medications.Urology was consulted who subsequently performed a corporal aspiration and irrigation. Approximately 75 cc of dark blood were evacuated, which led to flaccidity of the penis. A corporal blood gas was found to be consistent with ischemia with a pH<6.8, pCO2=86, and a paO2=19. Over the next three days, the patient required three additional aspiration and irrigation procedures due to recurrent priapism, and each time dark blood was drained. A combination of intracavernosal injection of phenylephrine and aspiration on hospital day 10 led to resolution of his priapism. Despite maximal medical management, the patient developed multiorgan failure and expired after a prolonged hospital course. DISCUSSION: This case is the second reported case of priapism in a patient admitted to a medical ICU for severe COVID-19. The patient's priapism was thought to be as a result of a prothrombotic state related to COVID-19. At the time of the diagnosis, the patient had not received any medications associated with priapism and was not on a propofol infusion. Per the patient's partner, he had no known prior episodes of priapism. CONCLUSIONS: Priapism may be a rare thromboembolic complication of severe COVID-19. Prompt recognition of this condition is important as a delay in diagnosis can lead to irreversible penile damage and erectile dysfunction. REFERENCE #1: Lamamri M, Chebbi A, Mamane J et al.

Coronavirus infection often begins in the nasopharynx and destroys the olfactory epithelium. Despite many studies, little progress has been made in the treatment of coronavirus. This study aimed to further investigate the pathogenicity of coronavirus to reduce its infection by examining the virus function in the body and its stages of infection. MATERIAL AND METHODS: With the aim of investigating the coronavirus and its effect on the human respiratory system from 1992 to 2020, this study examined the coronavirus and its different aspects and tried to answer whether there is an association between pneumonia and immune cells. This study was conducted in April 2020 and to obtain the related papers on the characteristics of the virus, Nature, ISC Pubmed, Medline WHO, NCBI, and PsycINFO databases were used. Out of 284 papers, 53 were used in this study. RESULT: Studies have shown that avoiding infected areas and strengthening the immune system inhibit the virus to bind the mucosal layers. Given the important role of acquired immunity and lymphocytes against coronavirus, it is necessary to pay attention to boost the immune system in adults and the elderly. Antioxidants help reduce the oxidative stress and inflammation in the immune system thus help it regenerate better. The results showed that children are susceptible to the virus though have lower mortality and clinical manifestations than adults. CONCLUSION: The vaccine should receive further attention and in the long run, antiviral drugs and broad-spectrum vaccines are produced for infectious diseases.","Rahimi, Besharat; Vesal, Ahmad; Edalatifard, Maryam",J Family Med Prim Care,213,16

We aimed to describe how health and demographic factors have been associated with excess mortality during the pandemic. Design: Time-series analysis. Setting: UK primary care data from practices contributing to the Clinical Practice Research Datalink on July 31st 2020. Participants: We constructed a time-series dataset including 9,635,613 adults ([≥]40 years old) who were actively registered at the general practice during the study period. Main outcome measures: We extracted weekly numbers of deaths between March 2015 and July 2020, stratified by individual-level factors. Excess mortality during wave 1 of the UK pandemic (5th March to 27th May 2020) compared to pre-pandemic was estimated using seasonally adjusted negative binomial regression models. Relative rates of death for a range of factors were estimated before and during wave 1 by including interaction terms. Results: All-cause mortality increased by 43% (95% CI 40%-47%) during wave 1 compared with pre-pandemic. Changes to the relative rate of death associated with most socio-demographic and clinical characteristics were small during wave 1 compared with pre-pandemic. However, the mortality rate associated with dementia markedly increased (RR for dementia vs no dementia pre-pandemic: 3.5, 95% CI 3.4-3.5; RR during wave 1: 5.1, 4.87-5.28); a similar pattern was seen for learning disabilities (RR pre-pandemic: 3.6, 3.4-3.5; during wave 1: 4.8, 4.4-5.3), for Black or South Asian ethnicity compared to white, and for London compared to other regions. Conclusions: The first UK COVID-19 wave appeared to amplify baseline mortality risk by a relatively constant factor for most population subgroups. However disproportionate increases in mortality were seen for those with dementia, learning disabilities, non-white ethnicity, or living in London.","Strongman, H.; Carreira, H.; De Stavola, B.

Analysis of candidates isolated in a previously performed selection from a Z variant E. coli library to the recombinant extracellular domain of human CD69, identified one cross-reactive Z variant with affinity to murine and human CD69. Affinity maturation was performed by randomization of the primary Z variant, followed by selections from the library. The resulting Z variants were evaluated for affinity towards human and murine CD69 and thermal stability. The in vivo biodistribution was assessed by SPECT/CT in rats following conjugation of the Z variants by a DOTA chelator and radiolabeling with Indium-111. A primary Z variant with a K(d) of approximately 50 nM affinity to human and murine CD69 was identified. Affinity maturation generated 5 additional Z variants with improved or similar affinity. All clones exhibited suitable stability. Radiolabeling and in vivo biodistribution in rat demonstrated rapid renal clearance for all variants, while the background uptake and washout varied. The variant Z(CD69:4) had the highest affinity for human and murine CD69 (34 nM) as well as the lowest in vivo background binding.

Shisha use among the young is increasing globally. Shisha smoke results in a high concentration of carbon monoxide, tar, nicotine, and heavy metals which can be toxic to humans, especially with chronic exposure. This study aims to determine the prevalence and risk factors of shisha smoking among in-school adolescents in Ethiopia. Four regional states in Ethiopia (Oromia, Amhara, Southern Nations, Nationalities, and Peoples’ Region, Tigray) and the capital city (Addis Ababa) were the study areas. A two-stage cluster sampling approach was employed to produce a representative sample. From the sampling frames in the study areas, 36 high schools were selected randomly. A multi-level logistic regression analysis was used to account for cluster-specific random effects, the effect of individuals’, and school-level variables for ever-use of shisha. A total of 3355 secondary school grade 9 and 10 students aged between 13 and 22 years took part in this study. A total of 86 (2.6%) and 20 (0.6%) of the study participants, reported that they had ever smoked or were current smokers of shisha, respectively. Of all study participants, 38.6% perceived shisha as less harmful than cigarettes and 48.5% reported that they do not know which was more harmful to health. Students were more likely to ever use shisha if they had friend/s who smoke shisha (AOR = 16.8, 95% CI: 6.4–44.3), ever smoked cigarettes (AOR = 8.2, 95% CI: 3.4–19.8), ever used khat (AOR = 4.2, 95% CI: 1.9–10.4), ever used marijuana (AOR = 3.9, 95% CI: 1.4–11.1), ever used smokeless tobacco (AOR = 3.1 95% CI: 1.1–8.4), and students had received income from their parents (AOR = 3.1 CI: 1.1–8.8). Prevalence of ever and current use of shisha among high school students is low in Ethiopia compared to many countries in Africa.

Regulators, blood centres and hospitals worldwide worked quickly to get CCP to the bedside. Although response was admirable, several areas have been identified to help improve future pandemic management. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A multidisciplinary, multinational subgroup from the ISBT Working Group on COVID‐19 was tasked with drafting a manuscript that describes the lessons learned pertaining to procurement and administration of CCP, derived from a comprehensive questionnaire within the subgroup. RESULTS: While each country’s responses and preparedness for the pandemic varied, there were shared challenges, spanning supply chain disruptions, staffing, impact of social distancing on the collection of regular blood and CCP products, and the availability of screening and confirmatory SARS‐CoV‐2 testing for donors and patients. The lack of a general framework to organize data gathering across clinical trials and the desire to provide a potentially life‐saving therapeutic through compassionate use hampered the collection of much‐needed safety and outcome data worldwide. Communication across all stakeholders was identified as being central to reducing confusion. CONCLUSION: The need for flexibility and adaptability remains paramount when dealing with a pandemic. As the world approaches the first anniversary of the COVID‐19 pandemic with rising rates worldwide and over 115 million cases and 2·55 million deaths, respectively, it is important to reflect on how to better prepare for future pandemics as we continue to combat the current one.","Wendel, Silvano; Land, Kevin; Devine, Dana V.; Daly, James; Bazin, Renée; Tiberghien, Pierre; Lee, Cheuk‐Kwong; Arora, Satyam; Patidar, Gopal K.; Khillan, Kamini; Smid, Willem Martin; Vrielink, Hans; Oreh, Adaeze; Al‐Riyami, Arwa Z.; Hindawi, Salwa; Vermeulen, Marion; Louw, Vernon; Burnouf, Thierry; Bloch, Evan M.; Goel, Ruchika; Townsend, Mary; So‐Osman, Cynthia",Vox Sang,213,21

The effects in primary care are understudied. This study aimed to explore changes in consultation numbers and patient management during the COVID-19 pandemic, and to identify challenges for patient care. DESIGN: Survey of paediatric primary care practices on consultation numbers and patient management changes, and semistructured interviews to identify challenges for patient care. Surveys and interviews were partially linked in an explanatory sequential design to identify patient groups perceived to be at higher risk for worse care during the pandemic. SETTING: In and around Düsseldorf, a densely populated area in Western Germany. The primary care facilities are spread over an area with approximately 2 million inhabitants. PARTICIPANTS: Primary care in Germany is provided through practices run by self-employed specialist physicians that are contracted to offer services to patients under public health insurance which is compulsory to the majority of the population. The sample contained 44 paediatric primary care practices in the area, the response rate was 50%. RESULTS: Numbers of consultations for scheduled developmental examinations remained unchanged compared with the previous year while emergency visits were strongly reduced (mean 87.3 less/week in March–May 2020 compared with 2019, median reduction 55.0%). Children dependent on developmental therapy and with chronic health conditions were identified as patient groups receiving deteriorated care. High patient numbers, including of mildly symptomatic children presenting for health certificates, in combination with increased organisational demands and expected staff outages are priority concerns for the winter. CONCLUSIONS: Primary care paediatricians offered stable service through the early pandemic but expected strained resources for the upcoming winter. Unambiguous guidance on which children should present to primary care and who should be tested would help to allocate resources appropriately, and this guidance needs to consider age group specific issues including high prevalence of respiratory symptoms, dependency on carers and high contact rates.","Kohns Vasconcelos, Malte; Weil, Katharina; Vesterling-Hörner, Daniela; Klemm, Mehrsad; el Scheich, Tarik; Renk, Hanna; Remke, Katharina; Bosse, Hans Martin",Fam Med Community Health,213,7

Especially for health professionals, flu vaccination is the best method to protect them, and the same applies for the patients and the general population from being infected. One of the most important preventive measure is vaccination and the main types of vaccines available, the limitations and side effects are briefly presented. AIM: The aim of this paper is to present the necessity of the healthcare professionals to conceptualize the importance of flu vaccination ifor themselves and the general population. Healthcare professionals are influenced by their knowledge, attitudes, and beliefs. Epidemiological surveys on this issue are presented for Greece, European Union, and the USA. METHODS: A broad scope literature review was conducted based on a strict selection process of articles referring to the general population and the healthcare professionals with emphasis on the time period from the fall of 2018 until the spring of 2020 across Greece. The method used in this research obtained information through bibliographical references throughout Europe, USA, and relevant studies in Greece. RESULTS: The results of this research indicated that influenza vaccination among healthcare professionals in Greece in the time period 2018-2019 was higher in primary health centers (PHCs) with a percentage of 43.8% than in Hospitals which was 30.6%. In addition, in the time period 2019-2020 flu vaccination among health professionals was higher in PHCs with a percentage of 57.9% rather than in Hospitals with a percentage of 38.8%. Specifically, flu vaccination rate which took place in hospitals was higher among physicians than in other healthcare personnel. Furthermore, the fundamental reasons for recommending flu vaccination in healthcare professionals are presented, and issues related to denial or acceptance of it are highlighted. Measures and strategies are proposed in order to increase flu vaccination coverage in healthcare facilities in Greece. CONCLUSIONS: Based on this research review healthcare professionals (HCPs) especially the ones working in ICUs, in ICUs for newborn children, in Departments for acute care infections, in Departments caring of persons with immunodeficiency or Units for transplantation, Oncology and Haematology Departments, and finally, in Emergency Care Units need directly to be vaccinated for the flu virus. Different measures have been undertaken to promote flu vaccination and the percentage of implementation has been highlighted.","Diomidous, Marianna; Isaakidou, Marianna",Mater Sociomed,213,30

The participants were instructed to view a video recording of a remote assessment situation and answer a 30-item questionnaire. Of 19 items ensuring the appropriateness for deglutition disorders detection, 13 items ultimately met the consensus criteria for remote feasibility. Factor analysis extracted three factors: ‘oral observation,’ ‘overall evaluation,’ and ‘perceptual voice judgment.’ In free-text responses, “quality and stability of the voice that may be heard through the device” were the most common concerns, followed by “the need to correct of the camera angle, magnification, and targets that should be projected,” “concerns about the technical aspects of the assistants and their role in relation with the examiner/ST,” and “the need for palpation as well as visual confirmation.” The proposed 13-item examination is considered to capture the characteristics of deglutition disorders, while items that appeared difficult to implement remotely were excluded. The fact that some items could be influenced by the video calling experience when judging the feasibility of remote implementation, the acceptability of such items, is likely to increase in the future.","Omori, Fumitaka; Fujiu-Kurachi, Masako; Iiboshi, Kiyoko; Yamano, Takafumi",Dysphagia,213,24

The wastewater characteristics, quantity, and handling methods have not only variations among countries but also within a country. Some hazardous substances of hospital wastewaters (HWWs) may have a regulatory status and should be treated accordingly while others have characteristics similar to that of domestic sewage. At a global level, guidelines do exist for treatment of these HWWs. But literatures have shown that legislation has various loopholes in implementation. This chapter outlines the current status of management and handling of HWWs around the major industrial hubs of worlds in two categories of developed (the United States, United Kingdom, and Europe) and developing (India, China, Iran, and Bangladesh) countries.

However, a full lockdown cannot be sustained for a prolonged period. An evidence-based, multidisciplinary approach on risk zoning, personal and transmission risk assessment in near real-time, and risk communication would support the optimized decisions to minimize the impact of coronavirus on our lives. This paper presents a framework to assess the individual and regional risk of COVID-19 along with risk communication tools and mechanisms. Relative risk scores on a scale of 100 represent the integrated risk of influential factors. The personal risk model incorporates age, exposure history, symptoms, local risk and existing health condition, whereas regional risk is computed through the actual cases of COVID-19, public health risk factors, socioeconomic condition of the region, and immigration statistics. A web application tool (http://www.covira.info) has been developed, where anyone can assess their risk and find the guided information links primarily for Nepal. This study provides regional risk for Nepal, but the framework is scalable across the world.

Several drugs are now being repurposed with the aim of identifying if these drugs provide some level of disease resolution. Of particular interest are chloroquine (CQ) and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), first developed as an antimalarial therapy. There is increasing concern with regards to the efficacy and safety of these agents. The aims of this review are to systematically identify and collate studies describing the use of CQ and HCQ in human clinical trials and provide a detailed synthesis of evidence of its efficacy and safety. Methods and Findings: Searches for (COVID AND chloroquine [title/abstract] AND outcomes[full text]) and two (COVID AND hydroxychloroquine[title/abstract] AND outcomes[full text]) yielded 272 unique articles. Unique articles were manually checked for inclusion and exclusion criteria and also subjected to a quality appraisal assessment. A total of 19 articles were included in the systematic review. Seventy-five percent of observational studies employing an endpoint specific to efficacy recorded no significant difference in the attainment of outcomes, between COVID-19 patients given a range of CQ and/or HCQ doses, and the control groups. All clinical trials and 82% of observational studies examining an indicator unique to drug safety discovered a higher probability of adverse events in those treated patients suspected of, and diagnosed with, COVID-19. Seventy-five percent of the total papers focusing on cardiac side-effects found a greater incidence among patients administered a wide range of CQ and/or HCQ doses, with QTc prolongation the most common finding, in addition to its consequences of VT and cardiac arrest. Of the total studies using mortality rate as an end-point, 60% reported no significant change in the risk of death, while 30% showed an elevation, and 10% a depression, in treated relative to control patients. Conclusion: The strongest available evidence suggests that, relative to standard in-hospital management of symptoms, the use of CQ and HCQ to treat hospitalised COVID-19 patients has likely been unsafe. At the very least, the poor quality of data failing to find any significant changes in the risk of VT should preclude definitive judgment on drug safety until the completion of high-quality randomised clinical trials.","takla, M.; Jeevaratnam, K.",,213,20

Different strategies are designed and employed to reduce those maternal delays, and one of such strategies employed to overcome the geographic barriers and improve maternal and neonatal health outcomes is utilization of maternity waiting homes (MWHs). Studies related to the utilization of MWHs and associated factors are limited in Ethiopia and there were none in the study area. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to assess the utilization of maternity waiting homes and associated factors. METHODS AND MATERIALS: A community-based cross-sectional study design was conducted, using multistage sampling technique. Logistic regression analysis with 95% CI for odds ratio (OR) was used to identify significant factors. RESULTS: A total of 379 women participated in this study, making a response rate of 85%. Of the total participants, 42.5% (95% CI=38–48) of women utilized MWHs. After controlling for potential confounders, women’s decision-making capacity (AOR=12.74; 95% CI=6.18–26.26), women having someone who can care for their children and/or husband at home (AOR=2.71; 95% CI=1.44–5.09), MWHs offering food service (AOR=4.03; 95% CI=2.07– 7.85), offering and/or allowing women to practice their own cultural ceremony (allowing to cook their own food type, porridge, coffee, etc) (AOR=9.55; 95% CI=4.45–20.47), and women’s attitude towards MWHs (AOR=0.09; 95% CI=0.03–0.23) were factors significantly associated with the utilization of MWHs. CONCLUSION: Compared to its contribution in reducing maternal and perinatal mortality, the utilization of MWHs was low in this study area. The integration of culturally sensitive and supportive maternity services, along with community participatory approach, would increase utilization of MWHs and consequently contribute in achieving the SDGs related to maternal and neonatal health.","Selbana, Desta Workneh; Derese, Msganaw; Sewmehone Endalew, Enatfenta; Gashaw, Bosena Tebeje",Int J Womens Health,213,5

The recognition of macro domains with various ligands is important for a variety of biological functions involved in NAD metabolism, including DNA repair, chromatin remodeling, maintenance of genomic stability, and response to viral infection. Nevertheless, how the macro domain binds to moieties with such structural obstacles using a simple cleft remains a puzzle. We systematically investigated the Middle East respiratory syndrome-coronavirus (MERS-CoV) macro domain for its ligand selectivity and binding properties by structural and biophysical approaches. Of interest, NAD, which is considered not to interact with macro domains, was co-crystallized with the MERS-CoV macro domain. Further studies at physiological temperature revealed that NAD has similar binding ability with ADPR because of the accommodation of the thermal-tunable binding pocket. This study provides the biochemical and structural bases of the detailed ligand-binding mode of the MERS-CoV macro domain. In addition, our observation of enhanced binding affinity of the MERS-CoV macro domain to NAD at physiological temperature highlights the need for further study to reveal the biological functions.","Lin, Meng-Hsuan; Cho, Chao-Cheng; Chiu, Yi-Chih; Chien, Chia-Yu; Huang, Yi-Ping; Chang, Chi-Fon; Hsu, Chun-Hua",Commun Biol,213,16

Two model lungs were ventilated with one ventilator to i) test the adequacy of individual tidal volumes via capnography, ii) assess cross-breathing between lungs, and iii) offer a simulation-based algorithm for ensuring equal tidal volumes. Ventilation asymmetry was induced by placing rubber band around one model lung, and the uneven distribution of tidal volumes (VT) was counterbalanced by elevating airflow resistance (HR) contralaterally. VT, end-tidal CO(2) concentration (ETCO(2)), and peak inspiratory pressure (Ppi) were measured. Unilateral LC reduced VT and elevated ETCO(2) on the affected side. Under HR, VT and ETCO(2) were re-equilibrated. In conclusion, capnography serves as simple, bedside method for controlling the adequacy of split ventilation in each patient. No collateral gas flow was observed between the two lungs with different time constants.

In 2018, the Vietnam Ministry of Health (MOH) conducted a full-scale exercise (FSX) in response to cases of severe viral pneumonia with subsequent laboratory confirmation for Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) to evaluate the country’s early warning and response capabilities for high-risk events. METHODS: An exercise planning team designed a complex fictitious scenario beginning with one case of severe viral pneumonia presenting at the hospital level and developed all the materials required for the exercise. Actors, controllers and evaluators were trained. In August 2018, a 3-day exercise was conducted in Quang Ninh province and Hanoi city, with participation of public health partners at the community, district, province, regional and national levels. Immediate debriefings and an after-action review were conducted after all exercise activities. Participants assessed overall exercise design, conduction and usefulness. RESULTS: FSX findings demonstrated that the event-based surveillance component of the MOH surveillance system worked optimally at different administrative levels. Detection and reporting of signals at the community and health facility levels were appropriate. Triage, verification and risk assessment were successfully implemented to identify a high-risk event and trigger timely response. The FSX identified infection control, coordination with internal and external response partners and process documentation as response challenges. Participants positively evaluated the exercise training and design. CONCLUSIONS: This exercise documents the value of exercising surveillance capabilities as part of a real-time operational scenario before facing a true emergency. The timing of this exercise and choice of disease scenario was particularly fortuitous given the subsequent appearance of COVID-19. As a result of this exercise and subsequent improvements made by the MOH, the country may have been better able to deal with the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 and contain it.

More than 80% of the End of Life (EoL) ships are dismantled in south Asian countries, namely Bangladesh, India, and Pakistan. Due to measures taken to minimize the propagation of the Coronavirus disease (COVID-19), an international supply chain is broken to a historic low, except for certain medical-related urgencies. Due to the disruption of global supply chains, the industry may submerge into uncertainty due to, perhaps, lack of adequate labor force to dismantled increased EoL ships and due to disturbances of vessel transportation to the recycling nations amid strong precautionary measures. Our estimate suggests that about 300 million gross tonnage (GT) available for demolition in the next five years and the inability to get them recycled would cost about 20 billion dollars. More importantly, South Asian recycling nations would suffer from economic losses and employment opportunities.

Icosapent ethyl is currently undergoing clinical trials to determine its anti-inflammatory effects in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). This report describes 3 intensive care unit (ICU) patients with moderate to severe COVID-19 pneumonia treated with icosapent ethyl as part of their supportive care who had favorable outcomes. CASE REPORTS: Case 1 was a 75-year-old man with a past medical history of hyperlipidemia, hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, obesity, and benign prostatic hyperplasia. Case 2 was a 23-year old man with a past medical history of type 2 diabetes mellitus and obesity. Case 3 was a 24-year old man with a history of autism.

In the present study, faecal samples from 100 diarrhoeic calves randomly picked up out of 17 outbreaks of bovine calf diarrhoea in periurban Ludhiana, Punjab in Northern India were subjected to conventional (microscopy, modified Zeihl–Neelsen (mZN) staining) and immunological and molecular techniques (faecal antigen capture ELISA and PCR) for detection of primary Cryptosporidium parvum infection as well as other frequently reported concurrent pathogens, viz. rotavirus and coronavirus, Salmonella spp., Escherichia coli, Clostridium perfringens and Eimeria spp. The faecal antigen capture ELISA and PCR revealed 35% prevalence of C. parvum in contrast to 25% by mZN staining with a relatively higher prevalence (66·7%) in younger (8–14-day-old) calves. The detection rate of the other enteropathogens associated with C. parvum was 45·71% for C. perfringens followed by Salmonella spp (40·0%), rotavirus (36·0%), coronavirus (16·0%), E. coli (12·0%) and Eimeria spp (4·0%) The sensitivity for detection of C. parvum by ELISA and mZN staining in comparison to PCR was 97·14% and 72·72%, respectively. An important finding of the study was that C. parvum alone was found in only 10% of the diarrhoeic faecal samples, whereas, majority of the samples (90%) showed mixed infections ranging from a combination of two to five agents. This is the first documentary proof of C. parvum and associated pathogens responsible for severe periurban outbreaks of bovine calf diarrhoea culminating in heavy mortality from Northern India.","BRAR, A.

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, and has been declared as a global pandemic by the World Health Organization. Patients with COVID-19 have deranged blood coagulation parameters and are prone to thromboembolic events. This hypercoagulable state caused by COVID-19 mainly manifests as venous thromboembolism. Peripheral arterial involvement is less frequent. We present a case of a spontaneous ALI in a COVID-19 patient. Case A 62-year-old man with an insignificant past medical history presented with ALI 12 days after an initial diagnosis of COVID-19. He was on therapeutic doses of low molecular weight heparin when ischemic symptoms developed. A surgical thrombectomy was unsuccessful. He partially benefited from intravenous unfractionated heparin and iloprost infusions. He was discharged home on postoperative day 14, and is scheduled to have an amputation of the 1st toe. Conclusions COVID-19 infection is associated with an increased incidence of thromboembolic events, including ALI. Even young and otherwise healthy patients may develop ALI despite the use of prophylactic anticoagulation. Management of ALI in COVID-19 patients might be harder than expected, due to the hypercoagulable state. Patients may benefit from prolonged postoperative unfractionated heparin administration.","Topcu, Ahmet Can; Ariturk, Cem; Yilmaz, Erdal",Thrombosis Update,213,16

METHODS: Thirty COVID-19 convalescents aged 22-57 years were studied: convalescents of mild COVID-19, asymptomatic convalescents, both with PCR-positive at the moment of diagnosis; and individuals with subclinical infection detected by viral-specific IgG. They received a single intramuscular injection of the FINLAY-FR-1A vaccine (50 µg of the recombinant dimeric receptor binding domain). The primary outcomes were safety and reactogenicity, assessed over 28 days after vaccination. The secondary outcome was vaccine immunogenicity. Humoral response at baseline and following vaccination was evaluated by ELISA and live-virus neutralization test. The effector T cellular response was also assessed. Cuban Public Registry of Clinical Trials, WHO-ICTRP: https://rpcec.sld.cu/en/trials/RPCEC00000349-En. FINDINGS: No serious adverse events were reported. Minor adverse events were found, the most common, local pain: 3 (10%) and redness: 2 (6·7%). The vaccine elicited a >21 fold increase in IgG anti-RBD antibodies 28 days after vaccination. The median of inhibitory antibody titres (94·0%) was three times greater than that of the COVID-19 convalescent panel. Virus neutralization titres higher than 1:160 were found in 24 (80%) participants. There was also an increase in RBD-specific T cells producing IFN-γ and TNF-α. INTERPRETATION: A single dose of the FINLAY-FR-1A vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 was an efficient booster of pre-existing natural immunity, with excellent safety profile. FUNDING: Partial funding for this study was received from the Project-2020-20, Fondo de Ciencia e Innovación (FONCI), Ministry of Science, Technology and the Environment, Cuba. RESUMEN ANTECEDENTES: Como un primer paso hacia una vacuna que proteja a los convalecientes de COVID-19 de la reinfección, evaluamos la vacuna FINLAY-FR-1A en un ensayo clínico. MÉTODOS: Se estudiaron treinta convalecientes de COVID-19 de 22 a 57 años: convalecientes de COVID-19 leve y convalecientes asintomáticos, ambos con prueba PCR positiva al momento del diagnóstico; e individuos con infección subclínica detectada por IgG específica viral. Los participantes recibieron una dosis única por vía intramuscular de la vacuna FINLAY-FR-1A (50 µg del dominio de unión al receptor recombinante dimérico del SARS CoV-2). Las variables de medida primarias fueron la seguridad y la reactogenicidad, evaluadas durante 28 días después de la vacunación. La variable secundaria, la inmunogenicidad. La respuesta humoral, al inicio del estudio y después de la vacunación, se evaluó por ELISA y mediante la prueba de neutralización del virus vivo. También se evaluó la respuesta de células T efectoras. Registro Público Cubano de Ensayos Clínicos, WHO-ICTRP: https://rpcec.sld.cu/en/trials/RPCEC00000349-En. RESULTADOS: No se reportaron eventos adversos graves. Se encontraron eventos adversos leves, los más comunes, dolor local: 3 (10%) y enrojecimiento: 2 (6·7%). La vacuna estimuló un incremento >21 veces de los anticuerpos IgG anti-RBD 28 días después de la vacunación.

While the overall mortality is low, the virus is highly virulent and may infect millions of people worldwide. This will consequently burden health systems, particularly by those individuals considered to be at high risk of severe complications from COVID-19. Such risk factors include advanced age, cardiovascular and pulmonary diseases, diabetes and cancer. However, few data on the outcomes of cancer patients infected by SARS CoV-2 exist. Therefore, there is a lack of guidance on how to manage cancer patients during the pandemic. We sought to propose specific recommendations about the management of patients with gastrointestinal malignancies. METHODS: The Brazilian Gastrointestinal Tumours Group board of directors and members sought up-to-date scientific literature on each tumour type and discussed all recommendations by virtual meetings to provide evidence-based—and sometimes, expert opinion—recommendation statements. Our objectives were to recommend evidence-based approaches to both treat and minimise the risk of COVID-19 for cancer patients, and simultaneously propose how to decrease the use of hospital resources at a time these resources need to be available to treat COVID-19 patients. RESULTS: Overall and tumour-specific recommendations were made by stage (including surgical, locoregional, radiotherapy, systemic treatments and follow-up strategies) for the most common gastrointestinal malignancies: esophagus, gastric, pancreas, bile duct, hepatocellular, colorectal, anal cancer and neuroendocrine tumours. CONCLUSIONS: Our recommendations emphasise the importance of treating cancer patients, using the best evidence available, while simultaneously taking into consideration the world-wide health resource hyperutilisation to treat non-cancer COVID-19 patients.","Riechelmann, Rachel P; Peixoto, Renata D’Alpino; Fernandes, Gustavo Dos Santos; Weschenfelder, Rui F; Prolla, Gabriel; Filho, Duílio Rocha; Andrade, Aline Chaves; Crosara, Marcela; Rego, Juliana Florinda M; Gansl, Rene C; Coimbra, Felipe; Aguiar, Samuel; Carvalho, Elisângela; Hoff, Paulo M; Coutinho, Anelisa K",Ecancermedicalscience,213,10

A major concern in severe COVID-19 is represented by a concomitant prothrombotic state. However, contrasting data are available about the prevalence of venous thromboembolism (VTE), including deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and/or pulmonary embolism (PE). A detailed search on the association of COVID-19 with thromboembolic complications was conducted in the main electronic databases (PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus) according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. The weighted mean prevalence (WMP) with 95% confidence interval (95% CI) was calculated with the random-effects model. Twenty studies enrolling 1,988 COVID-19 patients were included. The WMP of VTE was 31.3% (95% CI: 24.3–39.2%). The WMP of DVT was 19.8% (95% CI: 10.5–34.0%), whereas the WMP of PE was 18.9% (95% CI: 14.4–24.3%). Similar results were obtained when specifically analyzing studies on patients admitted to intensive care units and those on patients under antithrombotic prophylaxis. Regression models showed that an increasing age was associated with a higher prevalence of VTE (Z-score: 3.11, p = 0.001), DVT (Z-score: 2.33, p = 0.002), and PE (Z-score: 3.03, p = 0.002), while an increasing body mass index was associated with an increasing prevalence of PE (Z-score = 2.01, p = 0.04). Male sex did not impact the evaluated outcomes. The rate of thromboembolic complications in COVID-19 patients is definitely high. Considering the risk of fatal and disabling complications, adequate screening procedures and antithrombotic strategies should be implemented.","Di Minno, Alessandro; Ambrosino, Pasquale; Calcaterra, Ilenia; Di Minno, Matteo Nicola Dario",Semin Thromb Hemost,213,22

Herein, we evaluate the utility of whole slide imaging (WSI) in reducing diagnostic errors in pigmented cutaneous lesions by pathology fellows without subspecialty training in dermatopathology. Ten cases of 4 pigmented cutaneous lesions commonly encountered by general pathologists were selected. Corresponding whole slide images were distributed to our fellows, along with two sets of online surveys, each composed of 10 multiple-choice questions with 4 answers. Identical cases were used for both surveys to minimize variability in trainees' scores depending on the perceived level of difficulty, with the second set being distributed after random shuffling. Brief image-based teaching slides as self-assessment tool were provided to trainees between each survey. Pre- and post-self-assessment scores were analyzed. 61% (17/28) and 39% (11/28) of fellows completed the first and second surveys, respectively. The mean score in the first survey was 5.2/10. The mean score in the second survey following self-assessment increased to 7.2/10. 64% (7/11) of trainees showed an improvement in their scores, with 1 trainee improving his/her score by 8 points. No fellow scored less post-self-assessment than on the initial assessment. The difference in individual scores between two surveys was statistically significant (p = 0.003). Our study demonstrates the utility of WSI-based self-assessment learning as a source of improving diagnostic skills of pathology trainees in a short period of time.","Cho, Woo Cheal; Gill, Pavandeep; Aung, Phyu P.; Gu, Jun; Nagarajan, Priyadharsini; Ivan, Doina; Curry, Jonathan L.; Prieto, Victor G.; Torres-Cabala, Carlos A.",Ann Diagn Pathol,213,24

The academic debate on digitalization and food largely focuses on the input and farm level. Yet, based on the analysis of 280 digital services and products, we show that digital technologies are now being used along the entire food commodity chain. We argue that digital technologies in the third food regime serve on the one hand as a continuation of established information and communication technologies, thus deepening certain features of the existing food regime such as the retail sector’s control over global commodity chains. On the other hand, digital technologies also introduce new forms of control and value extraction based on the use of data and pave the way for large tech companies to take over market shares in the agri-food sector. Finally, we find that multinational agri-food companies are starting to take on the business models of leading digital tech companies, for instance by developing digital platforms throughout the agri-food system. We argue that this shows that the broader economic restructuring of neoliberal capitalism towards digital capitalism is also making its way into the agri-food system.

In May 2020, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has predicted nearly twice the normal number of tropical storms and hurricanes this season, while projections of COVID-19 models continue to rise in the United States as the Atlantic hurricane season progresses. Our research examines the critical intersection of hurricane response and public health in Harris County, Texas. We examine a hypothetical case of the 2017 Hurricane Harvey occurring amid the current pandemic. This research uses point of interest visitations as location intelligence data provided by SafeGraph together with Social Vulnerability Index and historical flood data to examine the critical intersection of natural hazard planning and response and the COVID-19 pandemic to assess the risks of a compound hazard situation. COVID-19 transmission hotspots and businesses in a community due to storm preparation activity were identified. The main drivers of transmission risk arise from overall pandemic exposure and increased interpersonal contact during hurricane preparation. Residents of health-risk areas will need to make logistical arrangements to visit alternative medical facilities for treatments related to either COVID-19 or physical impacts, such as injuries, due to the hurricane risks. Points of interest needed for disaster preparation are more likely to be situated in high-risk areas, therefore making cross-community spread more likely. Moreover, greater susceptibility could arise from social vulnerability (socioeconomic status and demographic factors) and disrupted access to healthcare facilities. Results from this study can be used to identify high-risk areas for COVID-19 transmission for prioritization in planning for temporary healthcare centers and other essential services in low-risk areas. Understanding the interplay between disaster preparation and the restrictive environment laid out by the pandemic is critical for community leaders and public health officials for ensuring the population has sufficient access to essential infrastructure services. The findings from this study can help guide the direction of disaster planning and pandemic response strategies and policies.","Dargin, Jennifer S.; Li, Qingchun; Jawer, Gabrielle; Xiao, Xin; Mostafavi, Ali",Int J Disaster Risk Reduct,213,1

Problem-based learning was used as a framework to create a scenario-based activity designed to develop GHD-related skills. The application and effectiveness of this scenario-based activity to develop GHD-related skills were assessed. A mixed-methods approach involving a self-administered survey and one focus group discussion was used. The survey collected baseline participant characteristics as well as understanding and improvements in GHD-related skills using a 5-point Likert scale. The focus group was audio-recorded and thematically analyzed using both inductive and deductive codes. Data integration was achieved by connecting and weaving. Method and investigator triangulation techniques were used. Participants self-reported significantly better postscenario-based activity responses when asked about their understanding of diplomacy, negotiation, communication, and how to address public health emergencies (P < 0.01, Wilcoxon signed rank test). Most participants either agreed or strongly agreed that their GHD-related skills improved with participation in the scenario-based activity (diplomacy = 55.6%; negotiation = 66.5%; communication = 72.2%; addressing public health emergencies = 72.1%). Overall, qualitative data were consistent with results obtained using quantitative methods. The scenario-based activity was effective for improving the self-reported understanding of GHD-related skills. The scenario-based activity was also effective for developing the selected GHD-related skills (as self-reported). This scenario-based activity is likely to reduce cognitive load and avoid participant overload, thereby facilitating learning.

However, the relationship between larger nursing homes and the community spread of SARS-CoV-2 has not yet been documented. OBJECTIVE: To examine the association between county average nursing home bed size and presence of certificate of need (CON) laws, which influence nursing home size, with county-level SARS-CoV-2 prevalence over time. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study using county-level data from March 11 through June 12, 2020. PARTICIPANTS: All US counties with at least one nursing home (n = 2,883). MAIN MEASURES: The main explanatory variables were county average nursing home bed size and presence of a CON law. The main outcome was the cumulative number of SARS-CoV-2 cases on each day of the study period adjusted for county population size and density, demographic and socioeconomic characteristics, total nursing home bed supply, other health care supply measures, epidemic stage, and census region. KEY RESULTS: By June 12, a between-county difference in average nursing home size equal to 1 bed was associated with 3.92 additional SARS-COV-2 cases (95% CI = 2.14 to 5.69; P < 0.001), on average, and counties subject to CON laws had 104.53 additional SARS-CoV-2 cases (95% CI = 7.68 to 201.38; P < 0.05), on average. Counties with larger nursing homes also demonstrated higher growth in the frequency of SARS-COV-2 throughout the study period. CONCLUSIONS: At the county level, average nursing home size and CON law presence was associated with a greater frequency of SARS-CoV-2 cases.

To better understand such differences, the current research examines whether relationships between health cognitions based on the Reasoned Action Approach (RAA) and eight COVID-19 protection behaviours vary as a function of participant-level socio-structural factors. METHODS: Within-person design with behaviours nested within participants in a two-wave online survey (one week delay) conducted during the UK national lockdown in April 2020. A UK representative sample of 477 adults completed baseline measures from the RAA plus perceived susceptibility and past behaviour for eight protection behaviours, and self-reported behaviour one week later. Moderated hierarchical linear models with cross-level interactions were used to test moderation of health cognitions by socio-structural factors (sex, age, ethnicity, deprivation). RESULTS: Sex, ethnicity and deprivation moderated the effects of health cognitions on protection intentions and behaviour. For example, the effects of injunctive norms on intentions were stronger in men compared to women. Importantly, intention was a weaker predictor of behaviour in more compared to less deprived groups. In addition, there was evidence that perceived autonomy was a stronger predictor of behaviour in more deprived groups. CONCLUSION: Socio-structural variables affect how health cognitions relate to recommended COVID-19 protection behaviours. As a result, behavioural interventions based on social-cognitive theories might be less effective in participants from disadvantaged backgrounds.","Schüz, Benjamin; Conner, Mark; Wilding, Sarah; Alwatan, Rana; Prestwich, Andrew; Norman, Paul",Soc Sci Med,213,9

Most frontline healthcare professionals have never witnessed anything like this before. As a result, staff may experience numerous and continuous traumatic events, which in many instances, will negatively affect their psychological well-being. Particularly, nurses face extraordinary challenges in response to shifting protocols, triage, shortages of resources, and the astonishing numbers of patients who require care in expedited time constraints. As most healthcare workers are passionate nursing professionals, frustration and often a sense of powerlessness occur when they find themselves unable to provide needed care to their patients. The overwhelming number of deaths, patients isolated and dying alone, and the ever-present fear of being infected and then infecting colleagues, family, friends due to the lack of protective gear or known protocols takes its toll on emotional and psychological well-being. For nurses, the experience of this significant (hopefully once-in-a-lifetime) event can inflict on-going moral injury. Nurses affected by this trauma require education, coping tools, and therapy to help avoid or alleviate the adverse effects on their well-being. Institutions must provide these resources to tend to the well-being of their healthcare staff, during and beyond the pandemic. This article aims to investigate moral distress—considering it as a moral injury—and offer tools and recommendations to support healthcare nurses as they respond to this crisis and its aftermath.","Hossain, Fahmida; Clatty, Ariel",Nurs Ethics,213,16

For persons who are at high risk of exposure, the standard of care is personal protection from getting infected. Whether Ayurvedic rasayana drug like Chyawanprash can prevent symptomatic infection in frontline health care workers is unknown. Objective: To evaluate the effect of the combination of Chyawanprash and Standard Preventive Regimen compared to the use of Standard Preventive Regimen alone on the proportion of RT-PCR confirmed COVID 19 infections among frontline healthcare workers (HCWs). Methods: An open label randomized controlled trial was conducted in the HCWs between 25 to 60 years age currently working in an environment with chance of direct exposure to COVID 19 cases. The interventions to be compared in this trial were Standard Preventive Regimen as per institutional guidelines and based on their roles (Group I) and Ayurvedic Intervention viz., Chyawanprash 12 g twice for 30 days from day of randomization plus Standard Preventive Regimen (Group II). The incidence of RT PCR confirmed COVID19 cases in both groups, was the primary outcome measure. Evaluation of the safety of the study drug (by any statistically significant change in various biochemical and hematological parameters and occurrence of any adverse drug reactions); incidence of any other infective diseases (bacterial / viral / fungal / etc.) like upper respiratory tract illness during the study period and any change in the immunoglobulins like IgG, IgM and IgE and inflammatory markers like TNF alpha, IL6 and IL10 were the secondary outcome measures. Results: Out of 193 participants who completed the study, no participant in both groups was COVID 19 positive at the end of one month. In post intervention follow up, 4 subjects in Group I and 2 subjects in Group II were COVID 19 positive. No adverse drug reaction or any serious adverse event was reported during the study. No clinically significant change in the safety parameters was observed before and after the study. Statistically significant rise in Serum IgG level was seen in Group II but other inflammatory and immune markers did not show statistically significant difference. Conclusion: Chyawanprash was well tolerated by all the participants in the intervention group but to prove its adaptogenic effect and efficacy as an add-on to the standard care in preventing the occurrence of COVID 19, clinical trial for longer duration with larger sample size is needed.

The initial therapeutic approach of SARS-CoV-2 disease is based upon the binding the receptor-binding site of the spike protein to the host cell's ACE-2 receptor on the plasma membrane. In this study, it is aimed to develop a biocompatible and biodegradable polymeric drug delivery system that is targeted to the relevant receptor binding site and provides controlled drug release. Oseltamivir phosphate (OP) is an orally administered antiviral prodrug for primary therapy of the disease in biochemically activated carboxylate form (oseltamivir carboxylate OC). In the presented study, model drug OP loaded poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) nanoparticles (NPs) targeted with spike-binding peptide 1 (SBP1) of SARS-CoV-2 were designed to be used as an efficient and prolonged released antiviral drug delivery systems. RY, EE, and DL values of the OP loaded NPs produced by the solvent evaporation method were calculated to be 59.3%, 61.4%, and 26.9%, respectively. The particle size of OP loaded NPs and OP loaded NPs targeted with SBP1 peptide were 162.0 ± 11.0 and 226.9 ± 21.4 nm, respectively. While the zeta potential of the produced OP loaded NPs was achieved negatively -23.9 ± 1.21 mV), the result of the modification with SBP1 peptide this value approached zero as -4.59 ± 0.728 mV. Morphological features of the OP loaded NPs were evaluated using FEG-SEM. The further characterization and surface modification of the NPs were analyzed by FT-IR. In-vitro release studies of NPs showed that sustained release of OP occurred for two months that fitting the Higuchi kinetic model. By evaluating these outputs, it was reported that surface modification of OP loaded NPs was significantly effective on characteristics such as size, zeta potential values, surface functionality, and release behavior. The therapeutic model drug-loaded polymeric formulation targeted with a specific peptide may serve as an alternative to more effective and controlled release pharmaceuticals in the treatment of COVID-19 upon an extensive investigation.","Ucar, Burcu; Acar, Tayfun; Pelit Arayici, Pelin; Derman, Serap",Nanotechnology,213,1

To explore these putative roles, we evaluated the independent and joint associations of cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) and frequency of sauna bathing (FSB) with pneumonia risk in a prospective cohort study of 2275 men aged 42‐61 years at recruitment. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Objectively measured CRF and self‐reported sauna bathing habits were assessed at baseline. CRF was categorized as low and high (median cut‐offs) and FSB as low and high (defined as ≤1 and 2‐7 sessions/wk, respectively). Multivariable‐adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) with confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated for incident pneumonia. RESULTS: During a median follow‐up of 26.6 years, 529 cases of pneumonia occurred. Comparing high vs low CRF, the multivariable‐adjusted HR (95% CIs) for pneumonia was 0.75 (0.61‐0.91). Comparing high vs low FSB, the corresponding HR was 0.81 (0.68‐0.97). Compared to men with low CRF & low FSB, the multivariable‐adjusted HRs of pneumonia for the following groups: high CRF & low FSB; low CRF & high FSB; and high CRF & high FSB were 0.88 (0.65‐1.20), 0.89 (0.71‐1.13), and 0.62 (0.48‐0.80) respectively. CONCLUSIONS: In a general male Caucasian population, a combination of high fitness levels and frequent sauna baths is associated with a substantially lowered future pneumonia risk compared with each modality alone. The implications of these findings in altering COVID‐19 disease or its severity deserve study.","Kunutsor, Setor K.; Laukkanen, Jari A.",Eur J Clin Invest,213,20

Concerns have risen in relation to SARS-CoV-2 and its potential for testicular involvement, since SARS-CoV-2-positive cryopreserved samples may have unknown effects on fertilization and embryo safety. This study therefore aimed to analyze the safety of sperm cryopreservation for cancer patients after the onset of the pandemic in Italy, through assessment of the risk of SARS-CoV-2 exposure and viral RNA testing of semen samples. METHODS: We recruited 10 cancer patients (mean age 30.5 ± 9.6 years) referred to our Sperm Bank during the Italian lockdown (from March 11th to May 4th 2020) who had not undergone a nasopharyngeal swab for SARS-CoV-2 testing. Patients were administered a questionnaire on their exposure to COVID-19, and semen samples were taken. Before cryopreservation, SARS-CoV-2 RNA was extracted from a 150 µl aliquot of seminal fluid in toto using QIAamp viral RNA kit (Qiagen) and amplified by a real time RT PCR system (RealStar SARS-CoV2 RT PCR, Altona Diagnostics) targeting the E and S genes. RESULTS: The questionnaire and medical interview revealed that all patients were asymptomatic and had had no previous contact with COVID-19 infected patients. All semen samples were negative for SARS-CoV-2 RNA. CONCLUSION: This preliminary assessment suggests that a thorough evaluation (especially in the setting of a multidisciplinary team) and molecular confirmation of the absence of SARS-CoV-2 in seminal fluid from asymptomatic cancer patients may assist in ensuring the safety of sperm cryopreservation.","Paoli, D.; Pallotti, F.; Nigro, G.; Aureli, A.; Perlorca, A.; Mazzuti, L.; Di Carlo, D.; Turriziani, O.; Lenzi, A.; Lombardo, F.",J Endocrinol Invest,213,20

Vaccine safety questions should be answered by correct, unbiased and evidence-based reports, and by addressing all possible problems including allergic reactions. Despite the fact that many COVID-19 vaccines are free from the majority of potentially sensitizing components, an allergic reaction can occur even in the form of a severe, life-threatening anaphylaxis. The frequency of allergic reactions against COVID vaccine is greater than that observed for other vaccinations. National and international allergology societies have proposed specific guidelines for individuals at risk of anaphylaxis by vaccine. Vaccines, like all the pharmaceutical preparations, are submitted to great safety and efficacy valuations, however, even the greatest pre-licensure experimentations are insufficient to evaluate the vaccine's potential to provoke anaphylaxis. Therefore, post-market surveillance is essential to analyze, record and characterize all adverse events.

More broadly, sex differences in infectious and inflammatory processes are well known, with women tending to mount stronger immune responses than men. Although there is evidence that sex hormone signaling is immunomodulatory, including downregulation of immune/inflammatory responses by androgens, the existence of numerous other physiologic differences between the sexes leads to great uncertainty in attributing worse infectious disease outcomes in men to androgen signaling. No definitive genetic data exist to support androgen-mediated immune suppression for viral susceptibility, nor for adrenal androgens. Here we show an association between inheritance of the common adrenal-permissive missense-encoding variant HSD3B1(1245C), that enables androgen synthesis from adrenal precursors10, and susceptibility to COVID. The adrenal-permissive HSD3B1(1245C) has previously been linked to suppression of inflammation in severe asthma. In analysis of COVID test results from the UK Biobank, we show that in older ([â¥] 70 years of age) subjects, the adrenal-permissive variant is associated with a greater chance of being COVID-positive. The effect increases with the number of HSD3B1(1245C) alleles inherited and is greater in females such that increasing androgen synthesis confers risk approaching males. Our study suggests that a common androgen synthesis variant regulates immune susceptibility to COVID infection as well as potentially other immune and inflammatory processes.","McManus, Jeffrey M.; Sabharwal, Navin; Bazeley, Peter; Sharifi, Nima",,213,18

In sickle cell disease (SCD), the apprehension was largely driven by concerns that the disease causes chronic inflammation, organ dysfunction and a prothrombotic state, especially during a vaso-occlusive crisis. Our assumption and hypothesis was that SCD pathology would be exacerbated by SARS CoV-2 infection leading to higher rates of acute chest syndrome (ACS), venous thromboembolism (VTE), more robust inflammatory responses requiring ICU care and increased death rates. Sickle cell trait (SCT) is frequently perceived as a benign condition; however, mounting evidence has shown that severe hypoxia (such as that seen in COVID-19 infection) can trigger sickle-related complication such as VTE, papillary necrosis and splenic infarcts and, in rare cases, ACS. In this retrospective analysis, we aimed to determine if sickle cell disorders (SCD & SCT) would confer poorer outcomes and/or increased mortality due to COVID-19 infection. Methods: Within the MedStar health care system there are 7,551 adult patients with a diagnosis of sickle cell disorder. We performed a retrospective chart review of all patients in the MedStar system with hemoglobinopathy and a lab-verified diagnosis of COVID-19 infection between March 1, 2020 and June 30, 2020. Sixty-one patients met our search criteria with 21 patients admitted to the hospital and 40 patients managed in the outpatient setting. Of the 21 patients admitted: 9 patients had sickle cell disease (Hb SS, Hb SC, Hb SB thalassemia) and 11 patients had sickle cell trait. One patient had HbC disease. Results: Results were analyzed by SCD genotype (Hb SS, Hb SC, Hb SB Thalassemia) versus the presence of a SCT. Due to the small sample size, statistical significance was not met in the variables. In the 21-patient cohort: 76.2% were female (60% of SCD and 90.9% of SCT) and 100% were African American. Median age was 46.5 years in the SCD group and 38 years in the SCT group. Length of stay was 10 days in the SCD group and 6 days in the SCT group. Mean peak white blood cell count and platelet count were significantly higher in SCD group (WBC: 15.1 k/uL vs 7.5 k/uL; p value 0.099. Platelets: 523 k/uL vs 185 k/uL; p value 0.082). Inflammatory markers were more elevated in the SCD cohort: mean Ferritin (915 ng/mL vs 520 ng/mL), mean D Dimer (2.96 mg/L vs 1.07 mg/L) and mean LDH (543 units/L vs 392 units/L). However, mean peak C-reactive protein (CRP) was higher in the SCT group (117.5 mg/L vs 67.7 mg/L). Admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) occurred in 11.1% with SCD & 36.4% with SCT and renal replacement therapy was required in 11.1% with SCD & 28.6% with SCT. Nasal cannula was required in 75% of patients (88.9% of SCD & 57.1% of SCT; p value 0.262) with only one SCT patient requiring intubation and mechanical ventilation whom later died. Two patients with Hb SS developed ACS, one of whom died. One patient with HbSC disease developed ACS and an acute cerebrovascular accident. No VTE or pulmonary embolisms were documented in this cohort. Therapeutic drugs used in the cohort varied, with 43.8% receiving antibiotics (other than Azithromycin), 37.5% receiving Azithromycin and 25% receiving Hydroxychloroquine. None of the patients received convalescent plasma, steroids, tociluzumab, sarilumab or remdesivir. Anticoagulation was used in 93.8% of the patients (13.3% of which were in therapeutic doses). Conclusions: Sickle cell disease diagnosis did not seem to influence response to COVID19 illness when compared to age-matched individuals with SCT. The number of patients with sickle cell disease admitted to the hospital after contracting SAR CoV2 infection was also remarkably low. These findings were, in general, unexpected. Although the inflammatory biomarkers were generally higher in the patients with SCD, more patients with SCT were admitted to the ICU and required renal replacement therapy. The major drawbacks of the study are the small sample size and missing data points (lack of labs, lack of documentation, transfer to another facility) that did not allow us to draw statistical conclusions about the differences in the patients with SCD versus SCT. We were also unable to determine the influence of SCD severity and pre-existing organ complications on outcomes in COVID 19 disease. Additional studies with larger cohorts is warranted.

This observational study was a secondary data analysis of publicly available data from the Texas Department of Criminal Justice (TBDJ) collected from March 1, 2020, until July 24, 2020. This project was completed in collaboration with the COVID Prison Project. We identified relevant profiles from the data: a low-outbreak profile, a high-outbreak profile, and a high-death profile. Additionally, current prison population and level of employee staffing predicted membership in the high-outbreak and high-death profiles when compared with the low-outbreak profile. Housing persons at 85% of prison capacity was associated with lower risk of COVID-19 infection and death. Implementing this 85% standard as an absolute minimum should be prioritized at prisons across the USA.

Because the NP is the viral protein shed during infection and its template mRNA is the most abundant subgenomic RNA, it is a suitable candidate for developing antibodies for diagnostic applications. In this study, we have prepared full-length SARS-CoV NP expressed in Escherichia coli and purified. Full-length NP was used for the preparation of mouse monoclonal antibody and chicken polyclonal IgY antibodies for the development of heterosandwich ELISA for early diagnostics of SARS-suspected individuals. The sensitivity of the developed heterosandwich ELISA can detect the viral antigen at 18.5 pg/mL of recombinant NP. This study describes ultrasensitive ELISA using 19B6 monoclonal antibody as the capture antibody and IgY as the detecting antibody against the most abundant SARS-CoV NP antigens. One of the most important findings was the use of inexpensive polyclonal IgY antibody to increase the sensitivity of the detection system for SARS-CoV at the picogram level. Furthermore, the immunoassay of SARS-CoV NP antigen developed could be an effective and sensitive method of diagnosing SARS-suspected individuals during a future SARS-CoV outbreak.","Palaniyappan, A.; Das, D.; Kammila, S.; Suresh, M.

It is need of the hour to develop automated methods, which could detect this disease at its early stage, in a non-invasive way and within lesser time. Currently, medical specialists are analyzing Computed Tomography (CT), X-Ray, and Ultrasound (US) images or conducting Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) for its confirmation on manual basis. In Pakistan, CT scanners are available in most hospitals at district level, while X-Ray machines are available in all tehsil (large urban towns) level hospitals.

The diagnosis can be challenging, especially in the ICU, where clinical symptoms as well as imaging are mostly nonspecific. Recently, Aspergillus lateral flow tests were developed to decrease the time to diagnosis of IPA. Several studies have shown promising results in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALf) from hematology patients. We therefore evaluated a new lateral flow test for IPA in ICU patients. METHODS: Using left-over BALf from adult ICU patients in two university hospitals, we studied the performance of the Aspergillus galactomannan lateral flow assay (LFA) by IMMY (Norman, OK, USA). Patients were classified according to the 2008 EORTC-MSG definitions, the AspICU criteria, and the modified AspICU criteria, which incorporate galactomannan results. These internationally recognized consensus definitions for the diagnosis of IPA incorporate patient characteristics, microbiology and radiology. The LFA was read out visually and with a digital reader by researchers blinded to the final clinical diagnosis and IPA classification. RESULTS: We included 178 patients, of which 55 were classified as cases (6 cases of proven and 26 cases of probable IPA according to the EORTC-MSG definitions, and an additional 23 cases according to the modified AspICU criteria). Depending on the definitions used, the sensitivity of the LFA was 0.88–0.94, the specificity was 0.81, and the area under the ROC curve 0.90–0.94, indicating good overall test performance. CONCLUSIONS: In ICU patients, the LFA performed well on BALf and can be used as a rapid screening test while waiting for other microbiological results.","Mercier, Toine; Dunbar, Albert; Veldhuizen, Vincent; Holtappels, Michelle; Schauwvlieghe, Alexander; Maertens, Johan; Rijnders, Bart; Wauters, Joost",Crit Care,213,1

This paper aims to evaluate the impact of COVID-19 on foot and ankle trauma in a major trauma centre. METHODS: A retrospective observational study of prospectively collected data was performed. All foot and ankle trauma patients over a 33 week period (1st December 2019–16th July 2020) were analysed. All patients with trauma classified by the AO/OTA as occurring at locations 43 and 81–88 were included. RESULTS: Over the 33 weeks analysed, there was a total of 1661 trauma cases performed; of these, only 230 (13.85%) were foot and ankle trauma cases. As percentage of cases during each period of lockdown, foot and ankle made up 15.20% (147 out of 967) pre-lockdown, 8.81% (17 out of 193) during lockdown and 13.17% (66 out of 501) post lockdown. This difference was statistically significant (p < .001). The most significant change in trauma management was the treatment of malleolar fractures. Further analysis showed that during the lockdown period 29 foot and ankle fractures were treated the same and 13 were treated differently, (i.e. 31% of fractures were treated conservatively, when the consultants preferred practice would have been surgical intervention). Of the 13 patients, 3 have had surgical management since lockdown has been eased. CONCLUSION: It is evident that the trauma case activity within foot and ankle was significantly reduced during the COVID-19 period. The consequences of change in management were mitigated due to a reduction in case load.","Stringer, Howard; Molloy, Andrew; Craven, Joanne; Moorehead, John; Santini, Alasdair; Mason, Lyndon",Foot (Edinb),213,28

Essential to a thoughtful diagnostic approach is understanding when to initiate a public health investigation and how to appropriately use commonly performed microbiology procedures in the sentinel laboratory to evaluate potential pathogens. Although diagnostic test development is evolving rapidly, recognizing many of these pathogens continues to challenge the capabilities of most sentinel laboratories. Therefore, effective, ongoing communication and education among clinicians, infection control personnel, sentinel laboratorians, public health authorities, and Laboratory Response Network reference laboratorians is the key to preparedness.","Pien, Brian C.; Saah, J.

Here the development of a new immuno real‐time PCR (iPCR) is described and its performance in the detection of human adenoviruses (HAdVs) in spiked stools is compared with those of ELISA and qPCR assays. For the iPCR, detection of the sandwich formed by the complexation of capture antibody‐antigen‐detection antibody was performed by qPCR thanks to the substitution of peroxydase by a chimeric DNA. This modification increased the detection sensitivity 200‐fold compared to ELISA. The direct qPCR results revealed that only 0.3–9.5% of the spiked HAdV were detectable, resulting from important losses of DNA occurring at the extraction step. This step was not necessary in the iPCR workflow, avoiding this drawback. The losses of viral particles occurred at the elution step from the stool only. The recovery rate of the iPCR was thus better and ranged between 21 and 54%. As a result, iPCR enabled the detection of lower virus concentrations in stool samples compared to those detected by ELISA and qPCR. The iPCR could be considered as a ‘hyper sensitive ELISA’ for early detection of HAdV infections, especially in the case of immunocompromised patients after haematopoietic stem cell transplant.","Bonot, S.; Ogorzaly, L.; El Moualij, B.; Zorzi, W.; Cauchie, H.‐M.",Clin Microbiol Infect,213,1

The use of unsecured smartphone cameras, digital cameras, social media, instant messaging, and commercially available cloud-based storage devices threatens patients’ data safety. This paper Identifies potential risks of clinical photography and heightens awareness of safe clinical photography. Specifically, we evaluated existing risk-mitigation strategies globally, comparing them to industry standards in similar settings, and formulated a framework for developing a risk-mitigation plan for avoiding data breaches by identifying the safest methods of picture taking, transfer to storage, retrieval, and use, both within and outside the organization. Since threats evolve constantly, the framework must evolve too. Based on a literature search of both PubMed and the web (via Google) with key phrases and child terms (for PubMed), the risks and consequences of data breaches in individual processes in clinical photography are identified. Current clinical-photography practices are described. Lastly, we evaluate current risk mitigation strategies for clinical photography by examining guidelines from professional organizations, governmental agencies, and non-healthcare industries. Combining lessons learned from the steps above into a comprehensive framework that could contribute to national/international guidelines on safe clinical photography, we provide recommendations for best practice guidelines. It is imperative that best practice guidelines for the simple, safe, and secure capture, transfer, storage, and retrieval of clinical photographs be co-developed through cooperative efforts between providers, hospital administrators, clinical informaticians, IT governance structures, and national professional organizations.

An essential determinant of the virus’ spread is a series of individual decisions, such as wearing face masks in public space. Those decisions depend on trade-offs between costs (or benefits) and risks, and beliefs are key to explain these. METHODS: We elicit beliefs about the COVID-19 pandemic during lockdown in France by means of surveys asking French citizens about their belief of the infection fatality ratio (IFR) for COVID-19, own risk to catch the disease, risk as perceived by others, and expected prevalence rate. Those self-assessments were measured twice during lockdown: about 2 weeks after lockdown started and about 2 weeks before lockdown ended. We also measured the quality of these beliefs with respect to available evidence at the time of the surveys, allowing us to assess the calibration of beliefs based on risk-related socio-demographics. Finally, comparing own risk to expected prevalence rates in the two successive surveys provides a dynamic view of comparative optimism with respect to the disease. RESULTS: The risk perceptions are rather high in absolute terms and they increased between the two surveys. We found no evidence for an impact of personal experience with COVID-19 on beliefs and lower risk perceptions of the IFR when someone in the respondent’s family has been diagnosed with a disease. Answers to survey 1 confirmed this pattern with a clear indication that respondents were optimistic about their chances to catch COVID-19. However, in survey 2, respondents revealed comparative pessimism. CONCLUSION: The results show that respondents overestimated the probabilities to catch or die from COVID-19, which is not unusual and does not necessarily reflect a strong deviation from rational behavior. While a rational model explains why the own risk to catch COVID-19 rose between the two surveys, it does not explain why the subjective assessment of the IFR remained stable. The comparative pessimism in survey 2 was likely due to a concomitant increase in the respondents’ perceived chances to catch the disease and a decreased expected prevalence rate.","Attema, Arthur E.; L’Haridon, Olivier; Raude, Jocelyn; Seror, Valérie",Front Psychol,213,1

So far, assays to determine SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies rely on cell-culture based infection assays either using wild type SARS-CoV-2 or pseudotyped viruses. Such assays are labour-intensive, require appropriate biosafety facilities and are difficult to standardize. Recently, a new surrogate virus neutralisation assay (sVNT) was described that uses the principle of an ELISA to measure the neutralization capacity of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies directed against the receptor binding domain. Here, we performed an independent evaluation of the robustness, specificity and sensitivity on an extensive panel of sera from 269 PCR-confirmed COVID-19 cases and 259 unmatched samples collected before 2020 and compared it to cell-based neutralization assays. We found a high specificity of 99.2 (95%CI: 96.9-99.9) and overall sensitivity of 80.3 (95%CI: 74.9-84.8) for the sVNT. Clinical sensitivity increased between early (<14 days post symptom onset or post diagnosis, dpos/dpd) and late sera (>14 dpos/dpd) from 75.0 (64.7-83.2) to 83.1 (76.5-88.1). Also, higher severity was associated with an increase in clinical sensitivity. Upon comparison with cell-based neutralisation assays we determined an analytical sensitivity of 74.3 (56.4-86.9) and 98.2 (89.4-99.9) for titres [≥]10 to <40 and [≥]40 to <160, respectively. Only samples with a titre [≥]160 were always positive in the sVNT. In conclusion, the sVNT can be used as an additional assay to determine the immune status of COVID-19 infected of vaccinated individuals but its value needs to be assessed for the specific context of use.","Meyer, B.; Reimerink, J.; Torriani, G.; Brouwer, F.; Godeke, G.-J.; Yerly, S.; Hoogerwerf, M.; Vuilleumier, N.; Kaiser, L.; Eckerle, I.; Reusken, C.",,213,33

This study aimed to quantify and describe the experiences of family medicine residents nationally during the early phases of the pandemic. Specific areas of interest included training received and the residents' personal sense of safety. The purpose of this study was to look for differences among residents based on geographic location. Method This May 2020 survey was conducted by the Council of Academic Family Medicine Educational Research Alliance (CERA) of a random sample of 5,000 resident members of the American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP). Results The overall response rate for the survey was 5.66% (283/5,000). More than 40% of residents reported having felt in moderate to significant personal danger during the COVID-19 pandemic. Fewer than 20% had been tested for COVID-19 themselves. Among all respondents, 176 (65.7%) of the residents had provided direct patient care for COVID-19-positive patients. Most had been trained on personal protective equipment and the medical aspects of COVID-19, but 16.2% reported no training on how to care for COVID-19 patients. Minority residents, and residents in larger urban areas were less likely to receive timely training. Conclusions The COVID-19 pandemic has had a major impact on family medicine residents' medical education and their sense of safety. Regional variations in residents' educational experiences during the pandemic exist. Training prior to COVID-19 exposure was not universal.

Diagnostic screening should be performed at a mass scale, extended to the asymptomatic population, and repeated over time. An accurate diagnostic pipeline for SARS-CoV-2 that could massively increase the laboratory efficiency, while being sustainable in terms of time and costs, should be based on a pooling strategy. In the past few months, researchers from different disciplines had this same idea: test groups, not individuals. This critical review intends to highlight both the general consents—even if the results from different publications have been obtained with different protocols—and the points of disagreement that are creating some interpretative/comprehension difficulties. Different pooling schemes and technical aspects associated to the type of pooling adopted are described and discussed.

Thereby, the CP controls many cellular processes including cell cycle progression and cell signalling. Inhibitors of the CP can suppress these essential biological pathways, resulting in cytotoxicity, an effect that is beneficial for the treatment of certain blood cancer patients. During the last decade, several preclinical studies demonstrated that selective inhibition of the immunoproteasome (iCP), one of several CP variants in mammals, suppresses autoimmune diseases without inducing toxic side effects. These promising findings led to the identification of natural and synthetic iCP inhibitors with distinct chemical structures, varying potency and subunit selectivity. This review presents the most prominent iCP inhibitors with respect to possible scientific and medicinal applications, and discloses recent trends towards pan-immunoproteasome reactive inhibitors that cumulated in phase II clinical trials of the lead compound KZR-616 for chronic inflammations.","Huber, Eva M.; Groll, Michael",Cells,213,1

However, uncertainty about insurance coverage and reimbursement policies for telemedicine has historically been a major barrier to adoption, especially among physicians in private practice (the majority of practicing allergists). RECENT FINDINGS: The COVID-19 public health emergency has highlighted the importance of telehealth as a safe and effective healthcare delivery model, with governments and payers rapidly expanding coverage and payment in an effort to ensure public access to healthcare in the midst of an infectious pandemic. This comprehensive review of updated telemedicine coverage and payment policies will include a tabular guide on how to appropriately bill and optimize reimbursement for telemedicine services. SUMMARY: This review of current trends in telemedicine coverage, billing, and reimbursement will outline the historical and current state of telemedicine payment policies in the USA, with special focus on recent policy changes implemented in light of COVID-19.

Quarantine motions may affect the economic systems and pharmaceutical medications may be recently in the developing phase. Thus, vaccination seems the best hope of the current situation to control COVID-19 epidemics. In this work, the dynamic model of COVID-19 epidemic is developed when the quarantine factor and the antiviral factor are established as free variables. Moreover, the impulsive populations are comprehended for traveling and migrating of individuals. The proposed dynamics with impulsive distractions are employed to generate the online data. Thereafter, the equivalent model is developed by using only the daily data of symptomatic infectious individuals and the optimal vaccination policy is derived by utilizing the closed-loop control topology. The theoretical framework of the proposed schemes validates the reduction of symptomatic infectious individuals by using fewer doses of vaccines comparing with the scheduling vaccination.","Treesatayapun, C.",Biomed Signal Process Control,213,24

However, there is little known about the psychological mechanisms that give rise to beliefs such as certainty of being infected by COVID-19, and this was investigated in the present study. Objective: Using the same data from the previous online survey with the same research team, we further investigated whether certainty of being infected by COVID-19 is associated with age, sex, health anxiety, and/or personality traits. Methods: Respondents (N = 375) filled out an online survey with 57 questions about symptoms similar to COVID-19, certainty of being infected by COVID-19, anxiety, stress, health anxiety, and personality dimensions (based on the five-factor model of personality). Results: Higher levels of conscientiousness and health anxiety were independently associated with certainty of being infected by COVID-19. The model predicted 29% of the variance in certainty of being infected by COVID-19. Conclusion: Being conscientious and worried about health issues were associated with the belief of being infected by COVID-19. Such finding may have implications for health care personnel who provide COVID-19 testing or consulting services to general population, as individuals high in these traits may over-report COVID-like symptoms. Theoretically, these findings point to psychological factors that may increase nocebo and possibly placebo effects. Clinically, the findings suggest that individuals high in conscientiousness and health anxiety may be more likely to over-report their bodily experiences.","Daniali, Hojjat; Flaten, Magne Arve",Front Psychol,213,3

This paper was aimed at conducting a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies reporting levels of depression among healthcare workers during the COVID-19 and estimating the pooled prevalence of depression. Methods: We searched for cross-sectional studies listed on PubMed from 1 December 2019 to 15 September 2020 that reported prevalence of depression in healthcare workers, nurses, medical doctors, and COVID-19 frontline professionals. The pooled proportions of depression were calculated with random effects models. Results: We identified 57 studies from seventeen countries. The pooled prevalence of depression in healthcare workers was 24% (95% CI: 20–28%), 25% for nurses (95% CI: 18–33%), 24% for medical doctors (95% CI: 16–31%), and 43% for frontline professionals (95% CI: 28–59%). Conclusions: The proportion of depression in nurses and medical doctors during the COVID-19 pandemic was similar to that found in the general population as previously reported in other meta-analyses conducted with smaller numbers of studies. Importantly, almost half of the frontline healthcare workers showed increased levels of depression. There is need for a comprehensive, international response to prevent and treat common mental health problems in healthcare workers.","Olaya, Beatriz; Pérez-Moreno, María; Bueno-Notivol, Juan; Gracia-García, Patricia; Lasheras, Isabel; Santabárbara, Javier",J Clin Med,213,1

While knowledge of highly structured regions is integral for mechanistic insights into the viral infection cycle, very little is known about the location and folding stability of functional elements within the massive (∼30-kb) SARS-CoV-2 RNA genome. In this study, we analyzed the folding stability of this RNA genome relative to the structural landscape of other well-known viral RNAs. We present an in silico pipeline to predict regions of high-base-pair content across long genomes and to pinpoint hot spots of well-defined RNA structures, a method that allows for direct comparisons of RNA structural complexity within the several domains in SARS-CoV-2 genome. We report that the SARS-CoV-2 genomic propensity for stable RNA folding is exceptional among RNA viruses, superseding even that of hepatitis C virus (HCV), one of the most structured viral RNAs in nature. Furthermore, our analysis suggests various levels of RNA structure across genomic functional regions, with accessory and structural open reading frames (ORFs) containing the highest structural density in the viral genome. Finally, we took a step further to examine how individual RNA structures formed by these ORFs are affected by the differences in genomic and subgenomic contexts, which, given the technical difficulty of experimentally separating cellular mixtures of subgenomic RNA (sgRNA) from genomic RNA (gRNA), is a unique advantage of our in silico pipeline. The resulting findings provide a useful roadmap for planning focused empirical studies of SARS-CoV-2 RNA biology and a preliminary guide for exploring potential SARS-CoV-2 RNA drug targets. IMPORTANCE The RNA genome of SARS-CoV-2 is among the largest and most complex viral genomes, yet its RNA structural features remain relatively unexplored. Since RNA elements guide function in most RNA viruses, and they represent potential drug targets, it is essential to chart the architectural features of SARS-CoV-2 and pinpoint regions that merit focused study. In this study, we found that RNA folding stability of SARS-CoV-2 genome is exceptional among viral genomes and we developed a method to directly compare levels of predicted secondary structure across SARS-CoV-2 domains. Remarkably, we found that coding regions display the highest structural propensity in the genome, forming motifs that differ between the genomic and subgenomic contexts. Our approach provides an attractive strategy to rapidly screen for candidate structured regions based on base pairing potential and provides a readily interpretable roadmap to guide functional studies of RNA viruses and other pharmacologically relevant RNA transcripts.","Tavares, Rafael de Cesaris Araujo; Mahadeshwar, Gandhar; Wan, Han; Huston, Nicholas C.; Pyle, Anna Marie",J Virol,213,28

The first case of the disease was detected in India on 31 January 2019, and confirmed cases stand at 74,281 as of 13 May 2020. Mathematical modeling can be utilized to forecast the final numbers as well as the endpoint of the disease in India and its states, as well as assess the impact of social distancing measures. In the present work, the Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) model and the Logistic Growth model have been implemented to predict the endpoint of COVID-19 in India as well as three states accounting for over 55% of the total cases - Maharashtra, Gujarat and Delhi. The results using the SIR model indicate that the disease will reach an endpoint in India on 12 September, while Maharashtra, Gujarat and Delhi will reach endpoints on 20 August, 30 July and 9 September respectively. Using the Logistic Regression model, the endpoint for India is predicted on 23 July, while that for Maharashtra, Gujarat and Delhi is 5 July, 23 June and 10 August respectively. It is also observed that the case numbers predicted by the SIR model are greater than those for the Logistic Growth model in each case. The results suggest that the lockdown enacted by the Government of India has had only a moderate impact on the spread of COVID-19, and emphasize the need for firm implementation of social distancing guidelines.","Malhotra, B.; Kashyap, V.",,213,16

Here, we review convergent traits in the physiology, immunology, flight-related ecology of birds and bats that might enable these taxa to act as viral reservoirs and asymptomatic carriers. Many species of birds and bats are well adapted to urban environments and may host more zoonotic pathogens than species that do not colonize anthropogenic habitats. These convergent traits in birds and bats and their ecological interactions with domestic animals and humans increase the potential risk of viral spillover transmission and facilitate the emergence of novel viruses that most likely sources of zoonoses with the potential to cause global pandemics.","Nabi, Ghulam; Wang, Yang; Lv, Liang; Jiang, Chuan; Ahmad, Shahid; Wu, Yufeng; Li, Dongming",Sci Total Environ,213,20

The mechanism of JHMV-induced demyelination remains unclear, though its tropism for oligodendrocytes had led to the belief that JHMV causes demyelination by direct lysis of these myelin-producing cells. However, several studies have also implicated the involvement of immune responses in the demyelinating process. In this communication, we present evidence that generalized immunosuppression with gamma irradiation prevents JHMV-induced demyelination, a finding that was not limited to a particular strain of JHMV or to one strain of mouse. In addition, significant paralytic-demyelinating disease was restored to infected, irradiated mice after the adoptive transfer of nylon wool nonadherent splenic cells and appeared to be restricted by the major histocompatibility complex (MHC).

METHODS: A cross sectional study was conducted by administering a well-structured questionnaire comprising of three sections including knowledge, attitude and practice amongst health care professionals in various hospitals and clinics, over a duration of two months ‘Feb-March’ 2020. The data from 810 participants were collected manually as well as through online survey registered on www.surveys.google.com, using a validated questionnaire. The questionnaire comprised of three sections assessing knowledge, awareness and practice of participants. The descriptive analysis was carried out for demographics and dependent variables with statistical program for social sciences. Spearman test was used to detect any relationship between the health care professional response with respect to their gender and level of education. A p value of < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. RESULTS: More than half (57.2%) of the health care professionals were working in a hospital setting. Fifty two percent of health care professionals had awareness and 72% were practicing adequate measures to combat COVID-19. The majority (81.9%) believed that the sign and symptoms are similar to a common flu and the main strata of population that could be affected by COVID-19 are elderly (79%). Seventy three percent of participants did not attend any lecture, workshop or seminar on COVID-19 for awareness purpose. Sixty seven percent of health care professionals were practicing universal precaution for infection control and 57.4% were using sodium hypochlorite as a surface disinfectant in dental surgeries. There was no significant relationship (p > 0.05) between the health care professionals’ responses with gender and their education level. CONCLUSION: The study suggests that the vast majority of the health care professionals have adequate knowledge and awareness related to COVID-19. However some aspects of practice of health care professionals were found to be deficient including, following CDC guidelines during patient care, acquiring verified knowledge related to COVID-19, disinfection protocol and the use of N-95 mask.
