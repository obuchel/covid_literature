The global road to recovery can be enhanced with robust, relevant, and timely scientific evidence. This commentary seeks to illustrate the power of science, scientific collaboration, and innovative research funding programs to inform pandemic recovery and inspire transformational changes for a more equitable, resilient, and sustainable future. Specifically, this commentary provides an introduction to the United Nations (UN) Research Roadmap for the COVID-19 Recovery that was published in November 2020. It introduces 5 scoping reviews that helped inform the UN Research Roadmap and that are now available open access within this series of special papers, and it provides an overview of an innovative research funding program that facilitated rapid mobilization and collaboration to produce the scoping reviews. The publication of the scoping reviews in this journal series will help complement and amplify the UN Research Roadmap by furthering knowledge mobilization efforts and informing COVID-19 recovery around the world, to ensure a more equitable, resilient, and sustainable postpandemic future.","McMahon, Meghan; Creatore, Marisa I; Thompson, Erin; Lay, Andrea Morgan; Hoffman, Steven J; Finegood, Diane T; Glazier, Richard H","International journal of health services : planning, administration, evaluation",883,1

Much of the recent conversation has focused on creating and implementing policies in times of crisis when resources are exhausted. Depending on how the pandemic develops, some communities may implement crisis measures, but many health care facilities are currently experiencing shortages of staff and materials even if the facilities have not implemented crisis standards. There is a need for shared conversation about equality and equity in these times of contingency between conventional and crisis medicine. To respond well to these challenges, I recommend that institutions rely on policy, professional education, and ethics consultation. As is the case with crisis policies, creating contingency policies requires that health care professionals decide on how, specifically, to achieve equity. A policy is only as effective as its implementation; therefore, institutions should invest in context-specific education on contingency policies. Finally, ethics consultation should be available for questions that contingency policies cannot address.","Bibler, Trevor",The Hastings Center report,883,24

In this review, we propose that the Barker hypothesis might explain the increased susceptibility to severe forms of COVID-19 in subjects who underwent intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR). In this paper evidence indicating an association between a low birth weight and an adult phenotype which might favor a severe outcome of SARS-CoV-2 infection are presented: lower lung functional capacity; increased respiratory morbidity; changes in fibrinogen and Factor VII serum levels and dysregulation of the hemostasis and thrombosis system; acquisition of a pro-thrombotic phenotype; low nephron number, with decreased ability to sustain renal function and increased renal morbidity; heart remodeling, with a less efficient cardiac function; endothelial dysfunction, a risk factor for the insurgence of the multiple organ failure; remodeling of arteries, with changes in the elastic properties of the arterial wall, predisposing to the insurgence and progression of atherosclerosis; dysfunction of the innate immune system, a risk factor for immune diseases in adulthood. These data suggest that young and adult subjects born too small (IUGR) or too early (pre-terms) might represent a subgroup of ""at risk subjects"", more susceptible toward severe forms of COVID-19. Given that LBW may be considered a surrogate of IUGR, this phenotypic marker should be included among the indispensable clinical data collected in every patient presenting with SARS-COV-2 infection, irrespectively of his/her age.","Gerosa, C; Faa, G; Fanni, D; Manchia, M; Suri, J S; Ravarino, A; Barcellona, D; Pichiri, G; Coni, P; Congiu, T; Piras, M; Cerrone, G; Cau, F; Ledda, F; Aimola, V; Coghe, F; Porcu, M; Cau, R; Orru', G; Van Eyken, P; La Nasa, G; Castagnola, M; Marongiu, F; Saba, L",European review for medical and pharmacological sciences,883,19

Early sequencing of the viral genome and knowledge from past coronavirus outbreaks (SARS-CoV-1 and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, MERS) has led to rapid advances in knowledge of how the virus spreads and infects human hosts. Unfortunately, advancing knowledge has not yet produced a treatment that substantially lowers morbidity or mortality and only recently resulted in the development of a vaccine that prevents severe disease. Mounting evidence supports the notion that dietary supplementation of key essential nutrients may contribute to the body's defenses against infection as well as bolster the body's responses to infection. Evidence supporting the potential beneficial roles of vitamin C, vitamin D, zinc, and B3 vitamins is reviewed here, revealing a combination of basic research elucidating underlying mechanisms of action, preclinical studies and human intervention studies has led to the proliferation of registered clinical trials on COVID-19. Overall, the data suggest this collection of nutrients has a promising impact on reducing the risk and/or severity of COVID-19, although firm conclusions await the results of these trials.","Bogan-Brown, Katrina; Nkrumah-Elie, Yasmeen; Ishtiaq, Yusrah; Redpath, Philip; Shao, Andrew",Journal of dietary supplements,883,8

However, due to the complex nature of mental disorders (e.g., high comorbidity), symptoms that are specifically associated with deficits in decision-making remain unidentified. Furthermore, the influence of psychiatric symptoms on computations underpinning reward-seeking and loss-avoidance decision-making remains elusive. Here, we aim to address these issues by leveraging a large-scale online experiment and computational modelling. METHODS In the online experiment, we recruited 1,900 non-diagnostic participants from the general population. They performed either a reward-seeking or loss-avoidance decision-making task, and subsequently completed questionnaires about psychiatric symptoms. RESULTS We found that one trans-diagnostic dimension of psychiatric symptoms related to compulsive behaviour and intrusive thought (CIT) was negatively correlated with overall decision-making performance in both the reward-seeking and loss-avoidance tasks. A deeper analysis further revealed that, in both tasks, the CIT psychiatric dimension was associated with lower preference for the options that recently led to better outcomes (i.e., reward or no-loss). On the other hand, in the reward-seeking task only, the CIT dimension was associated with lower preference for recently unchosen options. CONCLUSION These findings suggest that psychiatric symptoms influence the two types of decision-making, reward-seeking and loss-avoidance, through both common and distinct computational processes.

A variety of lines of evidence suggest that this interaction induces exaggerated inflammatory, cytokine, and tissue remodeling responses. We hypothesized that the 2'-5' oligoadenylate synthetase (OAS)/RNase L system, an innate immune antiviral pathway, plays an important role in the pathogenesis of these exaggerated responses. To test this hypothesis, we characterize the activation of 2'-5' OAS in lungs from mice exposed to CS and viral pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs)/live virus, alone and in combination. We also evaluated the inflammatory and remodeling responses induced by CS and virus/viral PAMPs in lungs from RNase L null and wild-type mice. These studies demonstrate that CS and viral PAMPs/live virus interact in a synergistic manner to stimulate the production of select OAS moieties. They also demonstrate that RNase L plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of the exaggerated inflammatory, fibrotic, emphysematous, apoptotic, TGF-β1, and type I IFN responses induced by CS plus virus/viral PAMP in combination. These studies demonstrate that CS is an important regulator of antiviral innate immunity, highlight novel roles of RNase L in CS plus virus induced inflammation, tissue remodeling, apoptosis, and cytokine elaboration and highlight pathways that may be operative in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and mechanistically related disorders.","Zhou, Yang; Kang, Min-Jong; Jha, Babal Kant; Silverman, Robert H; Lee, Chun Geun; Elias, Jack A",Journal of immunology,883,1

Methods: We analysed COVID-19 cases among travellers from mainland China to different regions and countries, comparing the region- and country-specific rates of detected and confirmed cases per flight volume to estimate the relative sensitivity of surveillance in different regions and countries. Results: Although travel restrictions from Wuhan City and other cities across China may have reduced the absolute number of travellers to and from China, we estimated that up to 70% (95% CI: 54% - 80%) of imported cases could remain undetected relative to the sensitivity of surveillance in Singapore. The percentage of undetected imported cases rises to 75% (95% CI 66% - 82%) when comparing to the surveillance sensitivity in multiple countries. Conclusions: Our analysis shows that a large number of COVID-19 cases remain undetected across the world. These undetected cases potentially resulted in multiple chains of human-to-human transmission outside mainland China.","Bhatia, Sangeeta; Imai, Natsuko; Cuomo-Dannenburg, Gina; Baguelin, Marc; Boonyasiri, Adhiratha; Cori, Anne; Cucunubá, Zulma; Dorigatti, Ilaria; FitzJohn, Rich; Fu, Han; Gaythorpe, Katy; Ghani, Azra; Hamlet, Arran; Hinsley, Wes; Laydon, Daniel; Nedjati-Gilani, Gemma; Okell, Lucy; Riley, Steven; Thompson, Hayley; van Elsland, Sabine; Volz, Erik; Wang, Haowei; Wang, Yuanrong; Whittaker, Charles; Xi, Xiaoyue; Donnelly, Christl A; Ferguson, Neil M",Wellcome open research,883,19

The follow-up data indicate that the blood pressure lowering effect of the procedure may last for up to 36 months. Despite the fact that RDN is a growing and promising technique, still more data from clinical trials are needed to support the long-term safety and persistent efficacy of this approach as compared to the best possible pharmacological treatment. It would also be particularly important to recognize the clinical features of patients who would benefit most from RDN as well as the clinical characteristics of non-responders to the procedure. As renal denervation also reduces whole-body sympathetic nerve activity, the clinical entities characterized by sympathetic nervous system activation - including hypertension coexisting with metabolic abnormalities and/or sleep apnea, chronic kidney disease, heart failure, and arrhythmias - may be potential new indications for the procedure. However, only a few small clinical studies so far have shown the potential benefit of renal denervation in these clinical situations and large clinical trials are needed to prove this concept. Catheter-based RDN is a promising (but also novel) therapeutic approach and further studies should also verify whether it can be considered as a procedure in management of patients not only with resistant hypertension, but also as a tool in the treatment of mild to moderate forms of hypertension.","Warchoł-Celińska, Ewa; Prejbisz, Aleksander; Florczak, Elżbieta; Kądziela, Jacek; Witkowski, Adam; Januszewicz, Andrzej",Postepy w kardiologii interwencyjnej = Advances in interventional cardiology,883,1

However, some countries lack national data, and some analyses focus on interventions with costs and benefits at regional or global scales. METHODS Recognizing the need for better estimates of appropriate values for application at these levels than those used in the past, we characterize population-weighted dollar per disability-adjusted life year (DALY) averted by World Bank Income Level based on available national estimates of the marginal productivity of the healthcare system. RESULTS The defaults suggested here reflect health opportunity costs across countries more consistent with existing evidence than those previously used or recommended. As countries change income levels and healthcare spending, and as additional or updated marginal productivity of healthcare expenditure estimates become available, we expect the defaults to change. CONCLUSION The best option for informing decisions around resource allocation in health care such that they improve health outcomes overall remains the use of time-appropriate country-specific estimates of the marginal productivity of the healthcare system. Instead of single, time-invariant defaults, health economists should seek to develop valuation inputs that better account for health opportunity costs and do so over time.","Ochalek, Jessica; Claxton, Karl; Lomas, James; Thompson, Kimberly M",Expert review of pharmacoeconomics & outcomes research,883,5

The virus is quite stable on stainless steel, being detected up to 48-72 hours after application. Therefore, some individuals can be infected touching common contaminated surfaces, such as bathroom taps. Taps can be underestimated critical points in the transmission chain of the infection. Indeed, just by turning the knob, people leave germs on it, especially after coughing over their hands, sneezing, and/or blowing their nose. After handwashing with soap, user take back their germs when turning the knob. Paradoxically, the following user collects the germs back on his/her fingers by implementing a preventive measure, maybe before putting food into the mouth or wearing contact lenses.The Italian National Institute of Health recommends to clean and disinfect high-touched surfaces, but it is unrealistic and inefficient to do so after each tap use. As an alternative, new toilets should install long elbow-levers - or at least short levers - provided that people are educated to close them with the forearm or the side of the hand. This is already a standard measure in hospitals, but it is particularly important also in high-risk communities, such as retirement homes and prisons. It would be important also in schools, in workplaces, and even in families, contributing to the prevention both of orofaecal and respiratory infections.In the meantime, people should be educated to close existing knobs with disposable paper towel wipes or with toilet paper sheets.","Donzelli, Alberto; Giudicatti, Giulia",Epidemiologia e prevenzione,883,1

However, this very large effort was characterized by several methodological weaknesses, both in the field of discovering effective treatments (with too many small and uncontrolled trials) and in the field of identifying preventable risks and prognostic factors (with too few large, representative and well-designed cohorts or case-control studies). OBJECTIVES in response to the fragmented and uncoordinated research production on Covid-19, the italian Association of Epidemiology (AIE) stimulated the formation of a working group (WG) with the aims of identifying the most important gaps in knowledge and to propose a structured research agenda of clinical and epidemiological studies considered at high priority on Covid-19, including recommendations on the preferable methodology. METHODS the WG was composed by 25 subjects, mainly epidemiologists, statisticians, and other experts in specific fields, who have voluntarily agreed to the proposal. The agreement on a list of main research questions and on the structure of the specific documents to be produced were defined through few meetings and cycles of document exchanges. RESULTS twelve main research questions on Covid-19 were identified, covering aetiology, prognosis, interventions, follow-up and impact on general and specific populations (children, pregnant women). For each of them, a two-page form was developed, structured in: background, main topics, methods (with recommendations on preferred study design and warnings for bias prevention) and an essential bibliography.

Activated CDC42-associated kinase 1 (ACK1), an activator of protein kinase B (AKT), is a promising target for KRAS-mutant tumor therapy, but the downstream ACK1 signaling remains poorly understood. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of combined ACK1/AKT inhibition on the proliferation, migration, invasion, and apoptosis of KRAS-mutant NSCLC cell lines (NCI-H23, NCI-H358, and A549). The cells were treated with an inhibitor of either ACK1 (dasatinib or sunitinib) or AKT (MK-2206 or GDC-0068), and the optimal concentrations of the two yielding synergistic tumor-killing effects were determined by applying the Chou-Talalay equation for drug combinations. We showed that combined administration of ACK1 and AKT inhibitors at the optimal concentrations effectively suppressed NSCLC cell viability and promoted apoptosis, while inducing cell cycle arrest at the G2 phase. Moreover, NSCLC cell migration and invasion were inhibited by combined ACK1/AKT inhibition. These phenomena were associated with the reduced phosphorylation levels of ACK1 and AKT (at Ser473 and Thr308), as well as alterations in caspase-dependent apoptotic signaling. Collectively, our results demonstrate the promising therapeutic potential of combined ACK1/AKT inhibition as a strategy against KRAS-mutant NSCLC. Our findings provide the basis for the clinical translation of biological targeted drugs (ACK1 and AKT inhibitors) and their rational combination in cancer treatment.","Yu, Xiangjing; Liu, Jie; Qiu, Huawei; Hao, Huiting; Zhu, Jinhong; Peng, Shiyun",Bosnian journal of basic medical sciences,883,5

Further experiments reveal that there exist dual-emission properties from a monomer-dimer equilibrium in the solution, exhibiting single-component multicolor emission from blue to orange including white-light emission.","Cao, Lei; Huang, Shiqing; Liu, Wei; Zhao, Hongyan; Xiong, Xiao-Gen; Zhang, Jian-Ping; Fu, Li-Min; Yan, Xiaoyu",Chemistry,883,33

Affected patients may encounter delayed healing and functional limitations. Although it is well established that Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) is the main causative pathogen of an FRI, the pathophysiology of an S. aureus-induced FRI is not well characterised over time. Therefore, an experimental study in mice comparing S. aureus-inoculated and non-inoculated groups was performed that particularly focused on staphylococcal abscess communities (SACs) and host cellular response. C57Bl/6N female mice received a double osteotomy of the femur, which was stabilised using a titanium 6-hole MouseFix locking plate and four screws. Animals were either S. aureus-inoculated or non-inoculated and euthanised between 1 and 28 d post-surgery. Histopathological evaluation showed normal bone healing for non-inoculated mice, whereas inoculated mice had no fracture consolidation and severe osteolysis. Within the bone marrow of inoculated mice, SACs were observed from 7 d, which increased in size and number over time. A fibrin pseudocapsule enclosed the SACs, which were surrounded by many Ly6G+ neutrophils with some Ly6C+ monocytes and F4/80+ macrophages, the majority of which were viable. The abscesses were encapsulated by fibrin(ogen), collagen and myofibroblasts, with regulatory T cells and M2 macrophages at the periphery. Only bone marrow monocytes and neutrophils of inoculated mice displayed functional suppression of T cells, indicative of myeloid-derived suppressor cells. The present study revealed that an FRI in mice is persistent over time and associated with osteolysis, SAC formation and an immunosuppressive environment.","Hofstee, M I; Riool, M; Gieling, F; Stenger, V; Constant, C; Nehrbass, D; Zeiter, S; Richards, R G; Zaat, S Aj; Moriarty, T F",European cells & materials,883,23
