8916,Prevalence of group A and group B rotaviruses in the feces of neonatal dairy calves from California,2001-06-07,"Infections caused by BHV1 are very common in Europe, but the disease pattern is quite different: the diseases of the genital tract are most common, those of the respiratory tract vary in intensity and prevalence. Digestive disorders connected with BHV1 are in general only observed in calves and mainly in Belgium. Virus strains causing abortion or encephalitis are only present in a few countries. The same is true for BHV1 induced mastitis. Dermatitis and lesions in the interdigital space seem to be a rare event. BHV1 infections are frequently complicated by bacterial secondary infections, but there is evidence that BHV1 infections can occur simultaneously with bovine virus diarrhoea (BVD) and/or parainfluenza-3 (PI 3) virus. The biggest problem associated with BHV1 infection is the ability of the agent to become latent following a primary infection. The genome of the virus probably remains during the life of the animal in the ganglia of the region where the primary infection occurred. No vaccination can overcome this latent stage. By prophylactic vaccination it is possible to prevent an outbreak of clinical disease but it is impossible to prevent infection followed by the establishment of latency. Eradication programmes in Austria, Denmark and Switzerland have removed most of the seropositive cattle from the bovine populations. Currently a sanitary programme is also being conducted in Germany.","Straub, Otto Christian",Comp Immunol Microbiol Infect Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7133897/,696
18485,Influence of Lactobacillus Biosurfactants on Skin Permeation of Hydrocortisone,2021-05-31,"SIMPLE SUMMARY: Genetic diversity in wildlife is a matter of growing concern in contexts related to disease transmission and human health. Tuberculosis is a zoonotic disease with relevant consequences and can present high prevalence in wild boar and red deer populations. Here, we review studies on the genetic diversity of ungulates, wild boar, and red deer, and assess to what extent these studies consider its importance in the spread of disease. The relationship between host genetic diversity and the probability of disease spread is illustrated in Spanish populations of wild boar and red deer. ABSTRACT: Host genetic diversity tends to limit disease spread in nature and buffers populations against epidemics. Genetic diversity in wildlife is expected to receive increasing attention in contexts related to disease transmission and human health. Ungulates such as wild boar (Sus scrofa) and red deer (Cervus elaphus) are important zoonotic hosts that can be precursors to disease emergence and spread in humans. Tuberculosis is a zoonotic disease with relevant consequences and can present high prevalence in wild boar and red deer populations. Here, we review studies on the genetic diversity of ungulates and determine to what extent these studies consider its importance on the spread of disease. This assessment also focused on wild boar, red deer, and tuberculosis. We found a disconnection between studies treating genetic diversity and those dealing with infectious diseases. Contrarily, genetic diversity studies in ungulates are mainly concerned with conservation. Despite the existing disconnection between studies on genetic diversity and studies on disease emergence and spread, the knowledge gathered in each discipline can be applied to the other. The bidirectional applications are illustrated in wild boar and red deer populations from Spain, where TB is an important threat for wildlife, livestock, and humans.","Pérez-González, Javier; Carranza, Juan; Martínez, Remigio; Benítez-Medina, José Manuel",Animals (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8229303/,696

30827,Clinical features and management,2008-04-10,"28924 hoverflies of 85 species were caught in a Malaise trap in an English suburban garden during the eight‐year period 1972–79, and three additional species were hand‐netted. Hoverfly larvae fall into five trophic categories all of which were represented by adults in the trap sample. 82.71% of the hoverflies trapped have larvae that feed on aphids, 12.04% feed on decaying organic material, 5.14% eat living plants, 0.09% scavenge in Hymcnoptera nests, and 0.02% are associated with tree sap or rotting wood. The relative frequency of the different trophic groups varied annually and seasonally although the aphid‐feeders were nearly always the most abundant. 22 species are believed to breed in the garden, and a further 29 in the surrounding area; 15 species are regarded as casual and 22 as chance visitors. It is suggested that the high plant diversity and spatial heterogeneity of gardens result in them supporting more species than would be found in a natural area.","Owen, Jennifer",Ecography (Cop.),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7163471/,696

Traditional session types include a form of choice whereby servers offer a collection of options, of which each client picks exactly one. This sort of choice constitutes a particular case of separated choice: offering on one side, selecting on the other. We introduce mixed choices in the context of session types and argue that they increase the flexibility of program development at the same time that they reduce the number of synchronisation primitives to exactly one. We present a type system incorporating subtyping and prove preservation and absence of runtime errors for well-typed processes. We further show that classical (conventional) sessions can be faithfully and tightly embedded in mixed choices. Finally, we discuss algorithmic type checking and a runtime system built on top of a conventional (choice-less) message-passing architecture.","Vasconcelos, Vasco T.; Casal, Filipe; Almeida, Bernardo; Mordido, Andreia",Programming Languages and Systems,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7702257/,696

Chest computed tomography revealed mild interstitial pneumonia. She had intermittent persistent inflammatory reactions with fever. Laboratory findings and RT-PCR test results showed SARS-CoV-2 positivity for more than 70 days. To the best of our knowledge, this relatively mild case has the longest duration of viral shedding recorded, as confirmed by RT-PCR analysis. This case demonstrates that the viral shedding in COVID-19 can be prolonged, even in mild disease, and highlights the difficulties in distinguishing viral shedding from SARS-CoV-2 infectivity.","Yamada, Eijiro; Ishida, Emi; Nakajima, Yasuyo; Horiguchi, Kazuhiko; Matsumoto, Shunichi; Okada, Shuichi; Kamitani, Wataru; Yamada, Masanobu",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7885527/,696

53728,"Polymeric surfaces with biocidal action: challenges imposed by the SARS-CoV-2, technologies employed, and future perspectives",2021-05-31,"In cystic fibrosis (CF), sustained infection and exuberant inflammation results in debilitating and often fatal lung disease. Advancement in CF therapeutics has provided successful treatment regimens for a variety of clinical consequences in CF; however effective means to treat the pulmonary infection and inflammation continues to be problematic. Even with the successful development of small molecule cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) correctors and potentiators, there is only a modest effect on established infection and inflammation in CF patients. In the pursuit of therapeutics to treat inflammation, the conundrum to address is how to overcome the inflammatory response without jeopardizing the required immunity to manage pathogens and prevent infection. The key therapeutic would have the capacity to dull the inflammatory response, while sustaining the ability to manage infections. Advances in cell-based therapy have opened up the avenue for dynamic and versatile immune interventions that may support this requirement. Cell based therapy has the capacity to augment the patient’s own ability to manage their inflammatory status while at the same time sustaining anti-pathogen immunity. The studies highlighted in this manuscript outline the potential use of cell-based therapy for CF. The data demonstrate that 1) total bone marrow aspirates containing Cftr sufficient hematopoietic and mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) provide Cftr deficient mice >50% improvement in survival and improved management of infection and inflammation; 2) myeloid cells can provide sufficient Cftr to provide pre-clinical anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial benefit; 3) hMSCs provide significant improvement in survival and management of infection and inflammation in CF; 4) the combined interaction between macrophages and hMSCs can potentially enhance anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial support through manipulating PPARγ. These data support the development of optimized cell-based therapeutics to enhance CF patient’s own immune repertoire and capacity to maintain the balance between inflammation and pathogen management.","van Heeckeren, Anna M.; Sutton, Morgan T.; Fletcher, David R.; Hodges, Craig A.; Caplan, Arnold I.; Bonfield, Tracey L.",Front Pharmacol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8155373/,696

A survey was designed and administered to students who were enrolled in at least one mathematics module in an Irish university at the time of the closures. The survey comprised three sections: teaching and learning, assessment and personal experience, with a focus on how the changes in teaching and assessment were viewed by students. A total of 263 students from six universities responded to the survey. The corresponding data are described, as are various trends that were identified through open-response questions. The data offer a window into the student experience during the tertiary level closures and show the effect that the sudden shifts (e.g., in delivery and support) had on learning, assessment and student well-being. The survey responses show that most students dealt with the rapid changes in a resilient and mature manner, particularly when confronted with adversity. Numerous insights can be gleaned from the students’ perspectives that have the potential to improve the teaching and learning of mathematics at tertiary level in Ireland in the future. Many of the findings could also apply to teaching and learning in other subjects and internationally.","Hyland, Diarmaid; O’Shea, Ann",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8500122/,696

62168,Minimal invasive surgery: NOSE and NOTES in ulcerative colitis.,2015,"BACKGROUND Continued evolution of implant-based breast reconstruction involves immediate placement of the implant above the pectoralis muscle. The shift to prepectoral breast reconstruction is driven by goals of decreasing morbidity such as breast animation deformity, range-of-motion problems, and pain, and is made possible by improvements in mastectomy skin flap viability. To define clinical factors to guide patient selection for direct-to-implant prepectoral implant reconstruction, this study compares safety endpoints and risk factors between prepectoral and subpectoral direct-to-implant breast reconstruction cohorts. The authors hypothesized that prepectoral direct-to-implant breast reconstruction is a safe alternative to subpectoral direct-to-implant breast reconstruction. METHODS Retrospective chart review identified patients who underwent prepectoral and subpectoral direct-to-implant breast reconstruction, performed by a team of five surgical oncologists and two plastic surgeons. Univariate analysis compared patient characteristics between cohorts. A penalized logistic regression model was constructed to identify relationships between postoperative complications and covariate risk factors. RESULTS A cohort of 114 prepectoral direct-to-implant patients was compared with 142 subpectoral direct-to-implant patients. The results of the penalized regression model demonstrated equivalence in safety metrics between prepectoral direct-to-implant and subpectoral direct-to-implant breast reconstruction, including seroma (p = 0.0883), cancer recurrence (p = 0.876), explantation (p = 0.992), capsular contracture (p = 0.158), mastectomy skin flap necrosis (p = 0.769), infection (p = 0.523), hematoma (p = 0.228), and revision (p = 0.122). CONCLUSIONS This study demonstrates that prepectoral direct-to-implant reconstruction is a safe alternative to subpectoral direct-to-implant reconstruction. Given the low morbidity and elimination of animation deformity, prepectoral direct-to-implant reconstruction should be considered when the mastectomy skin flap is robust.

Compared with face-to-face treatment, the use of digital interventions may be more cost-effective, appealing, and accessible, but there has been inadequate attention to their use with younger populations (children aged 5-12 years). OBJECTIVE This systematic review aims to (1) identify effective digital interventions, (2) report the characteristics of promising interventions, and (3) describe the user's experience of the digital intervention. METHODS A total of 4 databases were searched (Excerpta Medica Database [EMBASE], PsycINFO, Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System Online [MEDLINE], and the Cochrane Library) between January 2014 and January 2019. The inclusion criteria for studies were as follows: (1) children aged between 5 and 12 years, (2) interventions for behavior change, (3) randomized controlled trials, (4) digital interventions, and (5) chronic health conditions. Two researchers independently double reviewed papers to assess eligibility, extract data, and assess quality. RESULTS Searches run in the databases identified 2643 papers. We identified 17 eligible interventions. The most promising interventions (having a beneficial effect and low risk of bias) were 3 targeting overweight or obesity, using exergaming or social media, and 2 for anxiety, using web-based cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). Characteristics of promising interventions included gaming features, therapist support, and parental involvement. Most were purely behavioral interventions (rather than CBT or third wave), typically using the behavior change techniques (BCTs) feedback and monitoring, shaping knowledge, repetition and substitution, and reward. Three papers included qualitative data on the user's experience. We developed the following themes: parental involvement, connection with a health professional is important for engagement, technological affordances and barriers, and child-centered design. CONCLUSIONS Of the 17 eligible interventions, digital interventions for anxiety and overweight or obesity had the greatest promise. Using qualitative methods during digital intervention development and evaluation may lead to more meaningful, usable, feasible, and engaging interventions, especially for this underresearched younger population. The following characteristics could be considered when developing digital interventions for younger children: involvement of parents, gaming features, additional therapist support, behavioral (rather than cognitive) approaches, and particular BCTs (feedback and monitoring, shaping knowledge, repetition and substitution, and reward). This review suggests a model for improving the conceptualization and reporting of behavioral interventions involving children and parents.","Brigden, Amberly; Anderson, Emma; Linney, Catherine; Morris, Richard; Parslow, Roxanne; Serafimova, Teona; Smith, Lucie; Briggs, Emily; Loades, Maria; Crawley, Esther",Journal of medical Internet research,https://doi.org/10.2196/16924; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32735227/,696

RECENT FINDINGS Currently, there is a large debate on the use of antimalarials for prophylaxis and treatment of SARS-CoV-2-induced disease based on preclinical in-vitro data, small case series and extrapolation from earlier studies of their effect on intracellular pathogens, including many viruses. Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) or chloroquine have not demonstrated robust efficacy in prior randomized controlled studies against several other viruses. In-vitro data indicate a reduced viral replication of SARS-CoV-2. Especially immunomodulatory effects of antimalarials might also contribute to a clinical efficacy. For SARS-CoV-2 various large studies will provide answers as to whether antimalarials have a place in prophylaxis or treatment of the acute virus infection with SARS-CoV-2 but compelling data are missing so far.

This study aimed to measure burnout, work exhaustion, professional fulfillment, and post-traumatic stress symptoms among clinicians and administrators practicing in this high-stress field. METHODS This cross-sectional study utilized a 50 item web-based survey that included the Personal Fulfillment Index and the IES-R. This survey was distributed across four pediatric solid organ transplant centers in North America. Basic demographics, clinician characteristics, and information regarding wellness and self-care activities were collected. Descriptive and correlational analyses were performed. RESULTS One hundred and thirty five participants completed the survey, 76% were female and 78% were Caucasian. One-third (34%) of participants endorsed burnout, while 43% reported professional fulfillment. Approximately 15% of respondents endorsed clinically significant levels of post-traumatic stress symptoms related to patient deaths, with female clinicians more likely to endorse symptoms (p = .01). Nearly 80% of participants reported engaging in self-care activities outside of work and only 10% of participants reported participation in hospital-sponsored wellness programs. CONCLUSIONS Pediatric solid organ transplant team members exhibited moderate levels of burnout, professional fulfillment, and post-traumatic stress. Female clinicians were the most likely to experience both work exhaustion and post-traumatic stress symptoms. Transplant centers are encouraged to consider interventions and programming to improve clinician wellness.","Cousino, Melissa K; Bogle, Carmel; Lim, Heang M; McCormick, Amanda D; Sturza, Julie; Fredericks, Emily M; Magee, John C; Blume, Elizabeth D",Pediatric transplantation,https://doi.org/10.1111/petr.14020; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33861499/,696
84131,Equine Arteritis Virus Uses Equine CXCL16 as an Entry Receptor.,2016,"AIMS The aim of this study was to identify viruses associated with canine infectious respiratory disease syndrome (CIRDS) among a population of New Zealand dogs. METHODS : Convenience samples of oropharyngeal swabs were collected from 116 dogs, including 56 CIRDS-affected and 60 healthy dogs from various locations in New Zealand between March 2014 and February 2016. Pooled samples from CIRDS-affected (n=50) and from healthy (n=50) dogs were tested for the presence of canine respiratory viruses using next generation sequencing (NGS). Individual samples (n=116) were then tested by quantitative PCR (qPCR) and reverse transcriptase qPCR (RT-qPCR) for specific viruses. Groups were compared using Fisher's exact or χ2 tests. The effect of explanatory variables (age, sex, type of household, presence of viral infection) on the response variable (CIRDS-affected or not) was tested using RR. RESULTS : Canine pneumovirus (CnPnV), canine respiratory coronavirus (CRCoV), canine herpesvirus-1 (CHV-1), canine picornavirus and influenza C virus sequences were identified by NGS in the pooled sample from CIRDS-affected but not healthy dogs. At least one virus was detected by qPCR/RT-qPCR in 20/56 (36%) samples from CIRDS dogs and in 23/60 (38%) samples from healthy dogs (p=0.84). CIRDS-affected dogs were most commonly positive for CnPnV (14/56, 25%) followed by canine adenovirus-2 (CAdV-2, 5/56, 9%), canine parainfluenza virus (CpiV) and CHV-1 (2/56, 4% each), and CRCoV (1/56, 2%). Only CnPnV (17/60, 28%) and CAdV-2 (14/60, 23%) were identified in samples from healthy dogs, and CAdV-2 was more likely to be detected healthy than diseased dogs (RR 0.38; 95% CI=0.15-0.99; p= 0.045). CONCLUSIONS : The frequency of detection of viruses traditionally linked to CIRDS (CAdV-2 and CPiV) among diseased dogs was low. This suggests that other pathogens are likely to have contributed to development of CIRDS among sampled dogs. Our data represent the first detection of CnPnV in New Zealand, but the role of this virus in CIRDS remains unclear. On-going monitoring of canine respiratory pathogens by NGS would be beneficial, as it allows rapid detection of novel viruses that may be introduced to the New Zealand canine population in the future. Such monitoring could be done using pooled samples to minimise costs. CLINICAL RELEVANCE : Testing for novel respiratory viruses such as CnPnV and CRCoV should be considered in all routine laboratory investigations of CIRDS cases, particularly in dogs vaccinated with currently available kennel cough vaccines.","More, G D; Biggs, P J; Cave, N J; Acke, E; Dunowska, M",New Zealand veterinary journal,https://doi.org/10.1080/00480169.2021.1915211; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33840356/,696
88997,SARS-CoV-2 variants in India: a call for genomic surveillance.,2021-06-07,"The COVID-19 pandemic presents an urgent health crisis. Human neutralizing antibodies (hNAbs) that target the host ACE2 receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike1-5 show therapeutic promise and are being evaluated clincally6-8. To determine structural correlates of SARS-CoV-2 neutralization, we solved 8 new structures of distinct COVID-19 hNAbs5 in complex with SARS-CoV-2 spike trimer or RBD. Structural comparisons allowed classification into categories: (1) VH3-53 hNAbs with short CDRH3s that block ACE2 and bind only to ""up"" RBDs, (2) ACE2-blocking hNAbs that bind both ""up"" and ""down"" RBDs and can contact adjacent RBDs, (3) hNAbs that bind outside the ACE2 site and recognize ""up"" and ""down"" RBDs, and (4) Previously-described antibodies that do not block ACE2 and bind only ""up"" RBDs9. Class 2 comprised four hNAbs whose epitopes bridged RBDs, including a VH3-53 hNAb that used a long CDRH3 with a hydrophobic tip to bridge between adjacent ""down"" RBDs, thereby locking the spike into a closed conformation. Epitope/paratope mapping revealed few interactions with host-derived N-glycans and minor contributions of antibody somatic hypermutations to epitope contacts. Affinity measurements and mapping of naturally-occurring and in vitro-selected spike mutants in 3D provided insight into the potential for SARS-CoV-2 escape from antibodies elicited during infection or delivered therapeutically. These classifications and structural analyses provide rules for assigning current and future human RBD-targeting antibodies into classes, evaluating avidity effects, suggesting combinations for clinical use, and providing insight into immune responses against SARS-CoV-2.","Barnes, Christopher O; Jette, Claudia A; Abernathy, Morgan E; Dam, Kim-Marie A; Esswein, Shannon R; Gristick, Harry B; Malyutin, Andrey G; Sharaf, Naima G; Huey-Tubman, Kathryn E; Lee, Yu E; Robbiani, Davide F; Nussenzweig, Michel C; West, Anthony P; Bjorkman, Pamela J",Nature,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-020-2852-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33045718/,696

METHODS A prospective, two-period cohort intervention study. All CD performed between September 2006 and August 2007 (era 1) and between July 2009 and June 2010 (era 2) were included. Infection control program was implemented before era 2 and included a refresher course in aseptic and scrub techniques to all surgical teams. Infectious morbidity was recognized up to 30 days from the operation. Risk factors were identified by multiple logistic regressions. RESULTS A total of 1616 women included and analyzed during both eras. Logistic regression revealed that residency (rural as compared to urban), obesity and urgency of the CD were significant risk factors for infection. Prior to intervention, senior obstetricians had a lower infection rate than senior gynecologists (p = 0.02). Within both groups, the incidence in era 2 decreased and was comparable (obstetricians: 5.7 vs. 1.6%; p = 0.005; gynecologists: 12.7 vs. 1.1%; p = 0.003). Among the group of scrub nurses who took part in less than 20 CD during era 1, the intervention reduced significantly the infection rate during era 2 (p = 0.0002). CONCLUSION Surgical team is a MRF for infection following CD. Intervention decreased this unintended clinical effect attributed to surgical teams.","Salim, Raed; Braverman, Meirav; Teitler, Nava; Berkovic, Ilanit; Suliman, Abeer; Shalev, Eliezer","The journal of maternal-fetal & neonatal medicine : the official journal of the European Association of Perinatal Medicine, the Federation of Asia and Oceania Perinatal Societies, the International Society of Perinatal Obstetricians",https://doi.org/10.3109/14767058.2012.705394; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22746352/,696
91519,SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern are emerging in India.,2021-05-27,"OBJECTIVES We performed a systematic review and meta-regression analysis of randomized control trials to investigate the association between response to initial treatment and survival outcomes in patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma (MM). METHODS Response outcomes included complete response (CR) and the combined outcome of CR or very good partial response (VGPR), while survival outcomes were overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS). We used random-effect meta-regression models and conducted sensitivity analyses based on definition of CR and study quality. RESULTS Seventy-two trials were included in the systematic review, 63 of which contributed data in meta-regression analyses. There was no association between OS and CR in patients without autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT) (regression coefficient: .02, 95% confidence interval [CI] -0.06, 0.10), in patients undergoing ASCT (-.11, 95% CI -0.44, 0.22) and in trials comparing ASCT with non-ASCT patients (.04, 95% CI -0.29, 0.38). Similarly, OS did not correlate with the combined metric of CR or VGPR, and no association was evident between response outcomes and PFS. Sensitivity analyses yielded similar results. CONCLUSIONS This meta-regression analysis suggests that there is no association between conventional response outcomes and survival in patients with newly diagnosed MM.","Mainou, Maria; Madenidou, Anastasia-Vasiliki; Liakos, Aris; Paschos, Paschalis; Karagiannis, Thomas; Bekiari, Eleni; Vlachaki, Efthymia; Wang, Zhen; Murad, Mohammad Hassan; Kumar, Shaji; Tsapas, Apostolos",European journal of haematology,https://doi.org/10.1111/ejh.12868; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28178364/,696

While some measures can be achieved at the organisational level through policy, every Service person's experience of the COVID-19 pandemic will have differed, affected by a range of personal, occupational and geographical factors. A successful recovery phase for each Service personnel (SP) therefore relies on localised assessments and individualised support plans. The return of SP to the physical environment must be safe, and the financial needs of their whole family must be considered. Commanders must understand the need for balance in supporting social reconnection both personally and in the workplace. Commanders have an important role in the development of SPs' mental resilience; supporting mental well-being, early recognition of deteriorating mental health and signposting, and compassionate understanding of the needs of SP deployed or bereaved. Disruptions to healthcare service provision will impact the duration of medical downgrading, workforce capacity and operational effectiveness according to extant parameters, which must be understood by commanders. Likewise, functional fitness may have been adversely affected. Physical health and fitness recovery can be supported by time-based extensions to occupational health policy and graduated return to work physical training programmes.","Taylor, Hannah; Quantick, O; Ross, D",BMJ military health,https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjmilitary-2020-001603; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33055189/,696

DESIGN Two-arm, multi-centre pilot and feasibility randomised controlled trial. SETTING Five National Health Service hospitals in England. PARTICIPANTS Adults (n = 73) with non-traumatic rotator cuff tears scheduled for repair were recruited and randomly allocated remotely prior to surgery. INTERVENTIONS Early patient-directed rehabilitation (n = 37); advised to remove their sling as soon as able and move as symptoms allow. Standard rehabilitation (n = 36); sling immobilisation for four weeks. MEASURES (1) Randomisation of 20% or more eligible patients. (2) Difference in time out of sling of 40% or more between groups. (3) Follow-up greater than 70%. RESULTS 73/185 (39%) potentially eligible patients were randomised. Twenty participants were withdrawn, 11 due to not receiving rotator cuff repair. The between-group difference in proportions of participants who exceeded the cut-off of 222.6 hours out of the sling was 50% (80% CI = 29%, 72%), with the early patient-directed rehabilitation group reporting greater time out of sling. 52/73 (71%) and 52/53 (98%) participants were followed-up at 12 weeks when withdrawals were included and excluded respectively. Eighteen full-thickness re-tears were reported (early patient-directed rehabilitation = 7, standard rehabilitation = 11). Five serious adverse events were reported. CONCLUSION A main randomised controlled trial is feasible but would require allocation of participants following surgery to counter the issue of withdrawal due to not receiving surgery.","Littlewood, Chris; Bateman, Marcus; Butler-Walley, Stephanie; Bathers, Sarah; Bromley, Kieran; Lewis, Martyn; Funk, Lennard; Denton, Jean; Moffatt, Maria; Winstanley, Rachel; Mehta, Saurabh; Stephens, Gareth; Dikomitis, Lisa; Foster, Nadine E",Clinical rehabilitation,https://doi.org/10.1177/0269215520978859; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33305619/,696

The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of potential probiotic lactobacilli on new-born dairy calves' growth, diarrhoea incidence, faecal score, cytokine expression in blood cells, immunoglobulin A (IgA) levels in plasma and faeces, and pathogen abundance in faeces. Two in vivo assays were conducted at the same farm in two annual calving seasons. Treated calves received one daily dose of the selected lactobacilli (Lactobacillus reuteri TP1.3B or Lactobacillus johnsonii TP1.6) for 10 consecutive days. A faecal score was recorded daily, average daily gain (ADG) was calculated, and blood and faeces samples were collected. Pathogen abundance was analysed by absolute qPCR in faeces using primers directed at Salmonella enterica, rotavirus, coronavirus, Cryptosporidium parvum and three Escherichia coli virulence genes (eae, clpG and Stx1). The faecal score was positively affected by the administration of both lactobacilli strains, and diarrhoea incidence was significantly lower in treated calves. No differences were found regarding ADG, cytokine expression, IgA levels and pathogen abundance. Our findings showed that oral administration of these strains could improve gastrointestinal health, but results could vary depending on the calving season, which may be related to pathogen seasonality and other environmental effects.","Fernández, S; Fraga, M; Castells, M; Colina, R; Zunino, P",Beneficial microbes,https://doi.org/10.3920/bm2019.0167; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32877228/,696

METHODS Daily output from 1 English-language and 4 local Chinese-language newspapers published in Hong Kong between July 1 and August 31, 1968 were manually reviewed for all references to the presence of respiratory disease or influenza in southern China and Hong Kong. Public announcements from the World Health Organization Weekly Epidemiological Record were used to approximate international awareness. RESULTS Influenza A/Hong Kong/68 appeared abruptly in Hong Kong and within 1 week began to affect the functioning of the health care sector as well as civil infrastructure due to worker infection and absenteeism. Substantial delays in communication between Guangzhou, China, and Hong Kong officials contributed to delays in warning globally.

As potent effectors of the anti-tumor immune response, they are considered an attractive therapeutic target for immunotherapies, but their presence and abundance in the tumor microenvironment are not routinely assessed in patients with cancer. Here, we validated an antibody for immunohistochemistry analysis that specifically detects all γδ T-cell subpopulations in healthy tissues and in the microenvironment of different cancer types. Tissue microarray analysis of breast, colon, ovarian, and pancreatic tumors showed that γδ T-cell density varies among cancer types. Moreover, the abundance of γδ tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes was variably associated with the outcome depending on the cancer type, suggesting that γδ T-cell recruitment is influenced by the context. These findings also suggest that γδ T-cell detection and analysis might represent a new and interesting diagnostic or prognostic marker.","Chabab, Ghita; Boissière-Michot, Florence; Mollevi, Caroline; Ramos, Jeanne; Lopez-Crapez, Evelyne; Colombo, Pierre-Emmanuel; Jacot, William; Bonnefoy, Nathalie; Lafont, Virginie",Cells,https://doi.org/10.3390/cells9061537; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32599843/,696

Endoscopy plays a key role in the diagnosis and treatment of such cases. Endoscopic haemostasis is probably the most important technical challenge that must be mastered by gastroenterologists. It is essential for both the management of acute gastrointestinal haemorrhage and the prevention of bleeding during high-risk endoscopic procedures. During the last decade, endoscopic haemostasis techniques and tools have grown in parallel with the number of devices available for endotherapy. Haemostatic powders, over-the-scope clips, haemostatic forceps, and other emerging technologies have changed daily practise and complement the standard available armamentarium (injectable, thermal, and mechanical therapy). Although there is a lack of strong evidence-based information on these procedures because of the difficulty in designing statistically powerful trials on this topic, physicians must be aware of all available devices to be able to choose the best haemostatic tool for the most effective procedure.

STUDY DESIGN Preterm infants of gestational age <32 weeks (n = 193) were randomized to start resuscitation with either 30% oxygen (low-oxygen group) or 65% oxygen (high-oxygen group), after which the FiO2 was adjusted based on oxygen saturation values. The primary outcome was bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) assessed at 36 weeks postmenstrual age. Secondary outcomes included major neonatal illnesses and markers of oxidative stress. RESULTS The median gestational age of included infants was 28(6)/7 weeks (IQR, 26(5)/7-30(3)/7 weeks). The incidence of BPD was not significantly different between the low-oxygen and high-oxygen groups (24% vs. 17%; P = .15). The FiO2 in both groups was adjusted to a mean of 40% by 7 minutes in the low-oxygen group and by 11 minutes in the high-oxygen group. No differences in markers of oxidative stress were noted between groups. CONCLUSION Initial supplementation of preterm infants with 30% oxygen during the fetal-to-neonatal transition is as safe as 65% oxygen, with no differences in oxidative stress markers or BPD.","Rook, Denise; Schierbeek, Henk; Vento, Maximo; Vlaardingerbroek, Hester; van der Eijk, Anne C; Longini, Mariangela; Buonocore, Giuseppe; Escobar, Javier; van Goudoever, Johannes B; Vermeulen, Marijn J",The Journal of pediatrics,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpeds.2014.02.019; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24655537/,696

Choosing the adequate oxygenation strategy is of the utmost importance in that setting. High-flow nasal oxygen has recently shown survival benefits in unselected patients with acute respiratory failure. The objective was to assess outcomes of immunocompromised patients with hypoxemic acute respiratory failure treated with high-flow nasal oxygen. DESIGN We performed a post hoc analysis of a randomized controlled trial of noninvasive ventilation in critically ill immunocompromised patients with hypoxemic acute respiratory failure. SETTING Twenty-nine ICUs in France and Belgium. PATIENTS Critically ill immunocompromised patients with hypoxemic acute respiratory failure. INTERVENTION A propensity score-based approach was used to assess the impact of high-flow nasal oxygen compared with standard oxygen on day 28 mortality. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS Among 374 patients included in the study, 353 met inclusion criteria. Underlying disease included mostly malignancies (n = 296; 84%). Acute respiratory failure etiologies were mostly pneumonia (n = 157; 44.4%) or opportunistic infection (n = 76; 21.5%). Noninvasive ventilation was administered to 180 patients (51%). Invasive mechanical ventilation was ultimately needed in 142 patients (40.2%). Day 28 mortality was 22.6% (80 deaths). Throughout the ICU stay, 127 patients (36%) received high-flow nasal oxygen whereas 226 patients received standard oxygen. Ninety patients in each group (high-flow nasal oxygen or standard oxygen) were matched according to the propensity score, including 91 of 180 (51%) who received noninvasive ventilation. High-flow nasal oxygen was neither associated with a lower intubation rate (hazard ratio, 0.42; 95% CI, 0.11-1.61; p = 0.2) nor day 28 mortality (hazard ratio, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.45-1.42; p = 0.45). CONCLUSIONS In immunocompromised patients with hypoxemic acute respiratory failure, high-flow nasal oxygen when compared with standard oxygen did not reduce intubation or survival rates. However, these results could be due to low statistical power or unknown confounders associated with the subgroup analysis. A randomized trial is needed.","Lemiale, Virginie; Resche-Rigon, Matthieu; Mokart, Djamel; Pène, Frédéric; Argaud, Laurent; Mayaux, Julien; Guitton, Christophe; Rabbat, Antoine; Girault, Christophe; Kouatchet, Achille; Vincent, François; Bruneel, Fabrice; Nyunga, Martine; Seguin, Amélie; Klouche, Kada; Colin, Gwenahel; Kontar, Loay; Perez, Pierre; Meert, Anne-Pascale; Benoit, Dominique D; Papazian, Laurent; Demoule, Alexandre; Chevret, Sylvie; Azoulay, Elie",Critical care medicine,https://doi.org/10.1097/ccm.0000000000002085; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27655324/,696

The study of their movement is of importance. Gas bubbles are typically formed under liquids. Movement of liquid droplets on bioinspired conical surfaces is known to be facilitated by the Laplace pressure gradient. These conical surfaces, with various wettabilities and shapes, can also be used to move gas bubbles. In this study, effect of various liquids on movement of air bubble under liquid was studied. It was found that liquids with high surface tension and high density are more efficient in moving air bubbles. High surface tension and higher density increases the Laplace pressure gradient force and the buoyancy force, respectively, which drive under liquid air bubbles.","Gurera, Dev; Bhushan, Bharat",Journal of colloid and interface science,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcis.2020.08.031; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32818715/,696

Results: Eighteen (58.1%) faculty and 154 (75.9%) students completed the survey. Most students did not feel more engaged with their teammates or instructors using the online format and only one faculty member responded he/she felt more engaged with students via the online TBL format. Fortyone (26.7%) students responded they felt the online TBL improves knowledge retention, while no faculty responded they felt online TBL improved students' knowledge retention. The top challenges described include lack of student engagement and technological difficulties. Conclusion: This study showed that a lack of training and preparation for the sudden online TBL transition led to decreased student motivation and engagement.","Yu, F.; Wooster, J.; Yang, T.

163740,DeepSARS: simultaneous diagnostic detection and genomic surveillance of SARS-CoV-2,2021-08-18,"The interactions between severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and human host factors enable the virus to propagate infections that lead to COVID-19. The spike protein is the largest structural component of the virus and mediates interactions essential for infection, including with the primary ACE2 receptor. We performed two independent cell-based systematic screens to determine whether there are additional proteins by which the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 can interact with human cells. We discovered that in addition to ACE2, expression of LRRC15 also causes spike protein binding. This interaction is distinct from other known spike attachment mechanisms such as heparan sulfates or lectin receptors. Measurements of orthologous coronavirus spike proteins implied the interaction was restricted to SARS-CoV-2, suggesting LRRC15 represents a novel class of spike binding interaction. We localized the interaction to the C-terminus of the S1 domain, and showed that LRRC15 shares recognition of the ACE2 receptor binding domain. From analyzing proteomics and single-cell transcriptomics, we identify LRRC15 expression as being common in human lung vasculature cells and fibroblasts. Although infection assays demonstrated that LRRC15 alone is not sufficient to permit viral entry, we present evidence it can modulate infection of human cells. This unexpected interaction merits further investigation to determine how SARS-CoV-2 exploits host LRRC15 and whether it could account for any of the distinctive features of COVID-19. In brief We present evidence from genome-wide screening that the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 interacts with human cells expressing LRRC15. The interaction is distinct from previously known classes of spike attachment factors, and appears to have emerged recently within the coronavirus family. Although not sufficient for cell invasion, this interaction can modulate viral infection. Our data point to an unappreciated host factor for SARS-CoV-2, with potential relevance to COVID-19. Highlights - Two systematic cell-based screens for SARS-CoV-2 spike protein binding identify LRRC15 as a human host factor - Interaction with LRRC15 is reproducible in different human cell lines and independent of known glycan or ACE2 binding pathways - The C-terminal S1 domain of SARS-CoV-2 spike binds LRRC15 with sub-micromolar affinity, while related coronavirus spikes do not - LRRC15 is expressed in tissues with high ACE2 levels and may modulate infection","Shilts, Jarrod; Crozier, Thomas W.

Jump amplitudes are also random and governed by an arbitrary density. Such a model may describe the economic evolution, specially when extreme situations occur (pandemics, global wars, etc.). When, between jumps, the dynamical evolution is governed by an Ornstein–Uhlenbeck diffusion process, we obtain exact and explicit expressions for the discount function and the long-run discount rate and show that the presence of discontinuities may drastically reduce the discount rate, a fact that has significant consequences for environmental planning. We also discuss as a specific example the case when rates are described by the continuous time random walk.","Masoliver, Jaume Montero Miquel Perelló Josep",Mathematics,https://doi.org/10.3390/math9141589,696

The implementation of this approach requires sufficient amounts of data with a high quality along the data life cycle. This goal seems recently achievable through the implementation of several national digital health strategies and the hope of a growing societal acceptance of digital health applications due to the implications of the COVID-19 pandemic. But, a collection of tools and methods is missing, which supports developers to use data as driving force of the development process. Due to the iterative nature of software application development, it allows the continuous improvement through the integration of collected digital data.

The present work describes remote support and online group psychotherapy set in motion during COVID-19 emergency for outpatients with Binge Eating Disorder.ObjectivesAim of the present work is to describe and evaluate online support and group psychotherapy for outpatients with Binge Eating Disorder during lockdown due to COVID-19 emergency. Outcomes were evaluated by remote administration of questionnaires.Methods20 outpatients with Binge Eating Disorder, treated by psychotherapists of Hospital Psychology Unit in Psychiatry Day Hospital of an Italian General Hospital, received remote support by phone calls and online group psychotherapy from march to may 2020. During the first two weeks, patients were supported via phone calls. From the third week on, they took part to online group psychotherapy sessions, held every week at the same day and time. Pre-post remote administration of Clinical Outcomes in Routine Evaluation-Outcome Measure (CORE-OM) and the Questionnaire of Eating Behaviours (Scheda dei Comportamenti Alimentari, SCA) was used to evaluate outcomes. Data were analyzed by Student’s t-test.ResultsNo significant difference was found, thus indicating stability of symptomatology.ConclusionsLockdown was a highly stressful period, in which many people lost control on eating behaviours and those with Binge Eating Disorder were expected to have an exacerbation of symptoms. Remote support and online group psychotherapy proved effective in protecting patients from a possible aggravation of their condition.","Focà, F.; Santucci, F.

Despite USDA Dietary Guidelines endorsing the lipid hypothesis, debate about whether dietary saturated fat and cholesterol cause cardiovascular disease has continued. Methods Using Global Burden of Disease (GBD 2017) data on cardiovascular disease deaths/100k/year, ages 15-69 years old in male and female cohorts (CVD) and dietary and other risk factors, we formatted and population weighted data from 195 countries. Each of the resulting 7846 rows of data (cohorts) represented about 1 million people, projected to total about 7.8 billion people in 2020. We correlated CVD with dietary and other risk factors worldwide and in appropriate subsets. Findings Low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-c) correlated negatively with worldwide CVD (r= -0.282, 95% CI -0.302 to -0.262, p<0.0001). All foods were expressed in kilocalories/day (KC/d). We summed the KC/d of processed meat, red meat, fish, milk, poultry, eggs, and added (saturated fatty acid, polyunsaturated fatty acid, and trans fatty acid) to create a fat-soluble vitamins variable (FSVV) high in vitamins A, D, E, and K2 (menaquinones). The FSVV correlated negatively with CVD (r= -0.329, 95% CI -0.349 to -0.309, p<0.0001, n=7846 cohorts). We averaged CVD data from pairs of male and female cohorts to determine the 500 pairs of male and female cohorts with the lowest CVD (n=1000 cohorts arbitrarily, approximately 1 billion people). In this subset, mean CVD=227.8 and mean FSVV=531.4 KD/d versus worldwide mean CVD=542.4 and mean FSVV=285.4 KC/d. Meat and poultry negatively correlated with CVD worldwide (e.g., red meat mean=50.27 KC/d, r= -0.232, 95% CI -0.253 to -0.211, p<0.0001) and positively with CVD when FSVV >=531.4 KC/d (e.g., red meat mean=121.9 KC/d, r=0.633, 95% CI 0.597 to 0.668, p<0.0001). Fish and eggs negatively correlated with CVD both worldwide (e.g., mean eggs =19.4 KC/d, r= -0.390, 95% CI -0.408 to -0.371, p<0.0001) and when FSVV>=531.4 KC/d (e.g., mean eggs=39.8 KC/d, r= -0.261, 95% CI -0.315 to -0.206, p<0.0001). Milk product intake was high in 20/34 countries with the lowest CVD (range milk: 68.8 - 124.1 KC/d, including high levels of fermented cheeses with high vitamin K2, versus worldwide mean milk=25.0 KC/d). Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan had low CVD (CVD<=237.4) and low milk intake (mean milk<=29.0 KC/d but high intakes of fermented legumes containing vitamin K2. Interpretation: Since LDLc correlated negatively with CVD worldwide, the lipid hypothesis was not supported. These data support the fat-soluble vitamins hypothesis because FSVV correlated negatively with CVD worldwide, meaning the more fat-soluble vitamin containing animal foods and fat for gut absorption the less the CVD. Vitamin K2 containing milk products, particularly fermented cheeses, fermented legumes, particularly soy, and eggs, appear to be most protective against CVD. In high FSVV countries, reducing meat and poultry intake by at least half would likely reduce CVD significantly. This GBD analysis methodology could be used in developing food policy and education strategies for reducing CVD and improving public health. Funding: None","Cundiff, D.

Comparison of the results of calculations of the epidemic spread, as well as the values of the seven-day incidence values with the corresponding observation data, shows their good correspondence for each of the selected age groups. The greatest influence on the overall spread of the epidemic is in the 20-40 age groups. The relatively low level of vaccination and the high intensity of contact in these age groups contributes to the emergence of new waves of the epidemic, which is especially active when the virus mutates and the lockdown conditions are relaxed. The intensity of the epidemic in the 90+ age group has some peculiarities compared to other groups, which may be explained by differences in contact patterns among individuals in this age group compared to others. Approximate ratios for estimating mortality as a function of the intensity of infection for individual age groups are provided.

This article aims at analysing price cointegration between roundwood (sawlogs, pulpwood), sawmill by-products (sawdust, wood chips) and wood products (pellets, particle board) in the forest-based sector in Austria. Monthly price data for the period 2005–2019 were used for the following statistical tests: (1) The Augmented-Dickey-Fuller and Zivot-Andrews unit root tests were conducted to investigate stationarity of the data;(2) The Johansen Cointegration test was pairwise applied to price time series;(3) The Granger Causality test was used for cointegrated time series to examine which one is price leading. Furthermore, sawmill by-product prices were modelled as Vector Error Correction Models (VECM) to analyse their common behaviour. The dataset was divided to a training (2005–2017) and test (2018–2019) subset to assess the prediction accuracy of the models. The training data were used to estimate a VAR model as basis for forecasts, which were compared to the test data. Results show that sawdust prices are cointegrated and thus modelled with pellet and particle board prices. In contrast, wood chips are used for several applications and thus prices are cointegrated and modelled with prices of sawlogs, pulpwood, pellets and particle board. The comparison with the test data showed that forecasts were able to predict data from 2018 to 2019 well. However, a decrease in prices, starting in 2019 and intensified by the Covid-19 pandemic, could not be fully captured by these forecasts.","Fuhrmann, Marilene Dißauer Christa Strasser Christoph Schmid Erwin",Forest Policy and Economics,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.forpol.2021.102560,696

However, with the accelerating pace of modern life, people have fewer opportunities to participate in group-building activities. Furthermore, owing to the teleworking and quarantine requirements necessitated by the Covid-19 pandemic, the social connectedness of group members may become weak. To address this issue, in this study, we used an android robot to conduct daily conversations, and as an intermediary to increase intra-group connectedness. Specifically, we constructed an android robot system for collecting and sharing recent member-related experiences. The system has a chatbot function based on BERT and a memory function with a neural-network-based dialog action analysismodel. We conducted a 3-day human-robot conversation experiment to verify the effectiveness of the proposed system. The results of a questionnaire-based evaluation and empirical analysis demonstrate that the proposed system can increase the familiarity and closeness of group members.

Numerous initiatives aim to gauge the indirect impact of COVID-19 on RMNH. Methods: We assessed the impact of COVID-19 on RMNH coverage in the early stages of the pandemic using panel survey data from PMA-Ethiopia. Enrolled pregnant women were surveyed 6-weeks post-birth. We compared the odds of service receipt, coverage of RMNCH service indicators, and health outcomes within the cohort of women who gave birth prior to the pandemic and the COVID-19 affected cohort. We calculated impacts nationally and by urbanicity. Results: This dataset shows little disruption of RMNH services in Ethiopia in the initial months of the pandemic. There were no significant reductions in women seeking health services or the content of services they received for either preventative or curative interventions. In rural areas, a greater proportion of women in the COVID-19 affected cohort sought care for peripartum complications, ANC, PNC, and care for sick newborns. Significant reductions in coverage of BCG vaccination and chlorohexidine use in urban areas were observed in the COVID-19 affected cohort. An increased proportion of women in Addis Ababa reported postpartum family planning in the COVID-19 affected cohort. Despite the lack of evidence of reduced health services, the data suggest increased stillbirths in the COVID-19 affected cohort. Discussion: The government of Ethiopia's response to control the COVID-19 pandemic and ensure continuity of essential health services appears to have successfully averted most negative impacts on maternal and neonatal care. This analysis cannot address the later effects of the pandemic and may not capture more acute or geographically isolated reductions in coverage. Continued efforts are needed to ensure that essential health services are maintained and even strengthened to prevent indirect loss of life.","Carter, E.

However, the effects of pandemic on businesses vary widely across nations, regions, and industries. Some businesses are being pushed into liquidation and bankruptcy while others are struggling to maintain operational continuity. Yet others are forced to repurpose their expertise and resources in order to meet a sudden upsurge in the demand for their products and services. Likewise, there is a variation in the understandings and responses of entrepreneurs to the COVID-19 crisis. Our case study illustrates these variations. Using a multiple case study, we explore the perceptions, strategic responses, and managerial practices of Swedish SMEs during the COVID-19 crisis. The aim is to gain some insight into how SMEs manage the COVID-19 pandemic from both economic and CSR perspectives. The results indicate that the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic is related to the state of the industry in which the case companies are located, and the pre-crisis status of the companies. The perceptions of the entrepreneurs also differ. Some entrepreneurs perceive the crisis as a threat to their business while others see opportunities for innovation. These perceptions are likely to guide the strategic choices and managerial practices of the entrepreneurs. Digitalization is a common denominator with regard to social responsibility. However, the primary focus is on socially responsible practices for the health and safety of employees. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Tesfaye, B.; Lundström, A.","Palgrave Studies in Governance, Leadership and Responsibility",https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-73847-1_6,696

171765,Influence of Spray Nozzle Operating Parameters on the Fogging Process Implemented to Prevent the Spread of SARS-CoV-2 Virus,2021,"The shortage of medical personnel is now a problem and is expected to worsen in the future. Meanwhile, in the case of infectious diseases such as new coronavirus infections, it is very important that nurses and other medical staff treat patients as remotely as possible, which helps to prevent nosocomial infections and is also important for maintaining the medical system. One way to address these issues is to use mobile robots as assistants to automate the transport of patients and supplies. Wireless communication is necessary to control such robots remotely, but doing so with radio waves is undesirable in the medical field because of the impact on patients and medical equipment. Therefore, this paper proposes a teleoperation system for a wheeled mobile robot using visible light with a camera and an array of LEDs, an approach that affects neither patients nor medical equipment. This paper presents the development of visible light communication for this system by introducing a novel blinking pattern for the receiver and novel light-weight algorithm for the transmitter. According to a wide range of experiments, the proposed teleoperation system performs well enough for the remote control of wheeled robots in hospitals.

Manifestations including delirium and catatonia need to be considered in intubated COVID-19 patients. Medications known to exhibit neuroprotective effects, like valproate, can assist in agitation related to sedative withdrawal during extubation. This case series reports on the management of agitation, delirium, and catatonia in COVID-19 patients during and after extubation efforts. We present three cases in which Psychiatry was consulted for agitation in intubated COVID-19 patients. These patients were managed for severe agitation during weaning from extubation as well as for subsequent psychiatric challenges, including catatonia. Patient 1: 26-year-old female with bipolar I with psychotic features who was admitted for acute hypoxic respiratory failure from COVID-19 pneumonia. After an emergency C-section at 31 weeks’ gestation, she was intubated for 9 days and started on valproate 250 mg BID for agitation. She was extubated successfully and discharged home. Patient 2: 42-year-old female with bipolar I and PTSD who was intubated following COVID-19-related acute hypoxic respiratory failure. She received valproate 250mg BID and was extubated successfully. She became catatonic when home quetiapine was resumed and recovered following quetiapine discontinuation and lorazepam. She was discharged on valproic acid and alprazolam. Patient 3: 23-year-old female with bipolar I with psychotic features who was admitted for COVID-19 acute hypoxic respiratory failure and intubated. She received valproate 250 mg BID and was extubated successfully. She became catatonic when risperidone was re-initiated, but recovered following risperidone discontinuation and addition of lorazepam, gabapentin, and duloxetine. Quetiapine was added before discharge. Valproate was effective for managing delirium and agitation during extubation, as evidenced by normalizing Richmond Agitation and Sedation Scale scores. Additionally, valproate aided in managing catatonia post-extubation. This case series reports on the management of agitation in COVID-19 patients during extubation efforts with valproate sodium, due to its ability to manage delirium and catatonia. Valproate is known to exhibit neuroprotective effects, which possibly explains successful management of agitation during the extubation process. © 2021 by the author.","Schumaker, A.; Gomez, R.; Rojasova, S.; Muir, C.; Bukiri, K.; Korneffel, C.; Sharma, A.; Rao, M.; Meresh, E.",OBM Neurobiology,https://doi.org/10.21926/obm.neurobiol.2102099,696

Benefits of a quick end-of-outbreak declaration, such as reductions in trade/travel restrictions, must be balanced against the chance of flare-ups from undetected residual cases. We show how epidemiological modelling can be used to estimate the surveillance level required for decision-makers to be confident that an outbreak is over. Results from a simple model characterising an Ebola outbreak suggest that a surveillance sensitivity (i.e. case reporting percentage) of 79% is necessary for 95% confidence that an outbreak is over after 42 days without symptomatic cases. With weaker surveillance, unrecognised transmission may still occur: if the surveillance sensitivity is only 40%, then 62 days must be waited for 95% certainty. By quantifying the certainty in end-of-outbreak declarations, public health decision-makers can plan and communicate more effectively.","Thompson, Robin N.; Morgan, Oliver W.; Jalava, Katri",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/485821,696

However, it is still challenging to quantify team-level game performance because there is no strong ground truth. Thus, a team cannot receive feedback in a standardized way. The aim of this study was twofold. First, we designed a metric called LAX-Score to quantify a collegiate lacrosse team's athletic performance. Next, we explored the relationship between our proposed metric and practice sensing features for performance enhancement. To derive the metric, we utilized feature selection and weighted regression. Then, the proposed metric was statistically validated on over 700 games from the last three seasons of NCAA Division I women's lacrosse. We also explored our biometric sensing dataset obtained from a collegiate team's athletes over the course of a season. We then identified the practice features that are most correlated with high-performance games. Our results indicate that LAX-Score provides insight into athletic performance beyond wins and losses. Moreover, though COVID-19 has stalled implementation, the collegiate team studied applied our feature outcomes to their practices, and the initial results look promising with regard to better performance. © 2021 ACM.","Jung, W.; Watson, A.; Kuehn, S.; Korem, E.; Koltermann, K.; Sun, M.; Wang, S.; Liu, Z.; Zhou, G.","Proceedings of the ACM on Interactive, Mobile, Wearable and Ubiquitous Technologies",https://doi.org/10.1145/3478076,696

Presently, it is unknown if the AlphaFold-triggered revolution could help to solve other problems related to protein folding. Here we assay the ability of AlphaFold to predict the impact of single mutations on protein stability (ΔΔG) and function. To study the question we extracted metrics from AlphaFold predictions before and after single mutation in a protein and correlated the predicted change with the experimentally known ΔΔG values. Additionally, we correlated the AlphaFold predictions on the impact of a single mutation on structure with a large scale dataset of single mutations in GFP with the experimentally assayed levels of fluorescence. We found a very weak or no correlation between AlphaFold output metrics and change of protein stability or fluorescence.

Integrated communication is about consistent communication that is synergistic through multiple communication channels. Employer branding activities that involve multiple internal communication channels aim to attract employees. The study proposes that the perceived impact of effective integrated communication in employer branding shapes employee attitude and hence employee attraction. Employee perception of the choice of communication channels is also proposed to have an impact on employee attraction. Design/methodology/approach: An exploratory qualitative study in the form of interviews and a preliminary survey was conducted in the first phase. The main study involved a questionnaire survey to empirically test the proposed hypotheses. The respondents were information technology–business process management (IT-BPM) employees (n = 520) in India. Findings: The direct and interaction effects of integrated communication and usefulness of communication channels on employee attraction within the organization were empirically validated to suggest a positive impact on employee attraction. Originality/value: The study extends the current body of knowledge on talent attraction to include present employees. Similarly, the study on integrated communication and its impact on employee attraction is an important addition to the literature on employer branding, internal communication and talent management, given the present coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) situation. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Deepa, R.; Baral, R.",Corporate Communications,https://doi.org/10.1108/ccij-09-2020-0136,696

In this work, we targeted this enzyme through a structure-based drug design (SBDD) protocol, which aimed at the design of a new potential inhibitor for Mpro. The protocol involves three major steps: fragment-based drug design (FBDD), covalent docking and molecular dynamics (MD) simulation with the calculation of the designed molecule binding free energy at a high level of theory. The FBDD step identified five molecular fragments, which were linked via a suitable carbon linker, to construct our designed compound RMH148. The mode of binding and initial interactions between RMH148 and the enzyme active site was established in the second step of our protocol via covalent docking. The final step involved the use of MD simulations to test for the stability of the docked RMH148 into the Mpro active site and included precise calculations for potential interactions with active site residues and binding free energies. The results introduced RMH148 as a potential inhibitor for the SARS-CoV-2 Mpro enzyme, which was able to achieve various interactions with the enzyme and forms a highly stable complex at the active site even better than the co-crystalized reference.","El Hassab, M.

In response, brain antioxidant levels may also increase with age, although this has not been well investigated. Here we used edited magnetic resonance spectroscopy to quantify endogenous levels of glutathione (GSH, one of the most abundant brain antioxidants) in 37 young (mean: 21.8 (2.5) years; 19 F) and 23 older adults (mean: 72.8 (8.9) years; 19 F). Accounting for age-related atrophy, we identified higher frontal and sensorimotor GSH levels for the older compared to the younger adults. For the older adults only, higher sensorimotor (but not frontal) GSH was correlated with poorer balance, gait, and manual dexterity. This suggests a regionally-specific relationship between higher brain oxidative stress levels and motor performance declines with age. We suggest these findings reflect a compensatory upregulation of GSH in response to increasing brain oxidative stress with normal aging. Together, these results provide insight into age differences in brain antioxidant levels and implications for motor function.","Hupfeld, K. E.; Hyatt, H. W.; Jerez, P.

Explanations in human-human interactions are socially-situated. AI systems are often socio-organizationally embedded. However, Explainable AI (XAI) approaches have been predominantly algorithm-centered. We take a developmental step towards socially-situated XAI by introducing and exploring Social Transparency (ST), a sociotechnically informed perspective that incorporates the socio-organizational context into explaining AI-mediated decision-making. To explore ST conceptually, we conducted interviews with 29 AI users and practitioners grounded in a speculative design scenario. We suggested constitutive design elements of ST and developed a conceptual framework to unpack ST's effect and implications at the technical, decision-making, and organizational level. The framework showcases how ST can potentially calibrate trust in AI, improve decision-making, facilitate organizational collective actions, and cultivate holistic explainability. Our work contributes to the discourse of Human-Centered XAI by expanding the design space of XAI.","Ehsan, Upol; Liao, Q.

Methods: We determine the kinetics of IgM against the nucleocapsid (N) and IgG against the spike (S) and N proteins of SARS-CoV-2 in a cohort of 860 health professionals (healthy and infected) in northern Barcelona. We model the kinetics of IgG and IgM at nine time points over 13.5 months from infection, using non-linear mixed models by sex and clinical disease severity. Results: Of the 781 participants who were followed up, 478 (61.2%) became infected with SARS-CoV-2. Significant differences were found for the three antibodies by disease severity and sex. At day 270 after diagnosis, median IgM(N) levels were already below the positivity threshold in patients with asymptomatic and mild-moderate disease, while IgG(N, S) levels remained positive to days 360 and 270, respectively. Kinetic modelling showed a general rise in both IgM(N) and IgG(N) levels up to day 30, followed by a decay whose rate depended on disease severity. IgG(S) levels increased at day 15 and remained relatively constant over time. Conclusions: We describe kinetic models of IgM(N) and IgG(N, S) SARS-CoV-2 antibodies at 13.5 months from infection and disease spectrum. Our analyses delineate differences in the kinetics of IgM and IgG over a year and differences in the levels of IgM and IgG as early as 15 days from symptoms onset in severe cases. These results can inform public health policies around vaccination criteria.","Violan, C.; Toran, P.; Quirant, B.; Lamonja-Vicente, N.; Carrasco-Ribelles, L. A.; Chacon, C.; Manresa-Dominguez, J.

As a result, some patients have self-reported getting a boost with BNT. Therefore, this study aimed to compare SARS-CoV-2 spike 1-2 IgG antibodies in plasma samples between two groups: one group immunized with Ad5-nCoV and another with a heterologous vaccination regimen with Ad5-nCoV and BNT. Methods: Prospective observational study included a subgroup analysis of patients who received the Ad5-nCoV immunization during the first trimester of 2021 in a Northern city of Mexico; and agreed to a follow-up for an entire year through SARS-CoV-2 specific IgG antibodies measurement samples. During the three months follow-up, some patients self-reported receiving a BNT boost. We report IgG levels from basal, 21-28 days after Ad5-nCoV dose, three months, and an additional 21-28 days after BNT boost. Results: Seventeen patients 40 (16) years old, 52.9% men, were analyzed. We created four groups: (G1) patients vaccinated with Ad5-nCoV with no history of SARS-COV-2 (n=4), (G2) patients vaccinated with Ad5-nCoV and the first shot of BNT with no history of SARS-COV-2 (n=6), (G3) patients vaccinated with Ad5-nCoV with history of SARS-COV-2 (n=5), and (G4) patients vaccinated with Ad5-nCoV and the first shot of BNT with history of SARS-COV-2 (n=2). The group immunized with a heterologous vaccine scheme reported higher antibodies after 21-28 days of follow-up after BNT boost. Median (IQR): G1 46.7 (-), G2 1077.5 (1901), G3 1158.5 (2673.5), and G4 2090 (-) (p<0.05). Headache was the most frequent adverse reaction when patients received Ad5-nCoV (n = 10, 83%), and pain at the injection site was the most frequent adverse reaction with BNT boost (n = 5, 83.3%).

The existing literature is limited. Methods: Aerosols and splatter were generated from an ultrasonic scaling procedure on a dental mannequin and characterized by two optical imaging methods - digital inline holography (DIH) and laser sheet imaging (LSI). Capture efficiencies of various aerosol mitigation devices were evaluated and compared. Results: The ultrasonic scaling procedure generates a wide size range of aerosols up to a few hundred micrometers and occasional large splatter which emit at low velocity (mostly below 3 m/s). Use of a saliva ejector (SE) and high-volume evacuator (HVE) resulted in 63% and 88% of overall reduction respectively while an extraoral local extractor (ELE) resulted in a reduction of 96% at the nominal design flow setting. Conclusions: The study results showed that the use of ELE or HVE significantly reduced aerosol and splatter emission. The use of HVE generally requires an additional person to assist a hygienist, while an ELE can be operated hands-free when a dental hygienist is performing ultrasonic scaling and other operations. Practical Implications: An extraoral local extractor aids in the reduction of aerosols and splatters during ultrasonic scaling procedures, potentially reducing transmission of oral or respiratory pathogens, like SARS-CoV-2. Position and airflow of the device are important to effective aerosol mitigation.","Ou, Q.; Placucci, R. G.; Danielson, J.; Anderson, G.; Olin, P.; Jardine, P.; Madden, J.; Yuan, Q.; Grafe, T.

Therap. 7/2021),2021,"This study assessed the environmental performance and energy efficiency of electricity generation from rice straw using a combined gasification and internal combustion engine (G/ICE). A life cycle assessment (LCA) was performed to consider the conversion to electricity of rice straw, the production of which was based on the Philippine farming practice. Rice straw is treated as a milled rice coproduct and assumes an environmental burden which is allocated by mass. The results of an impact assessment for climate change was used directly in a system dynamic model to plot the accumulated greenhouse gas emissions from the system and compare with various cases in order to perform sensitivity analyses. At a productivity of 334 kWh/t, the global warming potential (GWP) of the system is equal to 0.642 kg CO2-eq/MJ, which is 27% lower than the GWP of rice straw on-site burning. Mitigating biogenic methane emissions from flooded rice fields could reduce the GWP of the system by 34%, while zero net carbon emissions can be achieved at 2.78 kg CO2/kg of milled rice carbon sequestration. Other sources of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are the use of fossil fuels and production of chemicals for agricultural use. The use of agricultural machinery and transport lorries has the highest impact on eutrophication potential and human toxicity, while the application of pesticides and fertilizers has the highest impact on ecotoxicity. The biomass energy ratio (BER) and net energy ratio (NER) of the system is 0.065 and 1.64, respectively. The BER and NER can be improved at a higher engine efficiency from 22% to 50%. The use of electricity produced by the G/ICE system to supply farm and plant operations could reduce the environmental impact and efficiency of the process.","Reaño, Resmond L.; Victor Antonio, N. de Padua Halog Anthony B.",Energies,https://doi.org/10.3390/en14164942,696

Manaus, Brazil offers a concerning glimpse of what may come: six months after the majority of the city's population experienced primary infection, a second wave with a new strain resulted in more deaths than the first wave. Current hypotheses for this surge rely on prior immunity waning due to time and antigenic distance. Here we show this hypothesis predicts a severe endemic state. We propose an alternative hypothesis in which individuals infected in the first wave lose protection against transmission but retain immunity against severe disease and show this hypothesis is equally compatible with existing data. In this scenario, the increased number of deaths is due to an increased infection fatality ratio (IFR) for primary infections with the new variant. This alternative predicts a mild endemic state will be reached within decades. Collecting data on the severity of reinfections and infections post-vaccination as a function of time and antigenic distance from the original exposure is crucial for optimizing control strategies.","Lavine, J.

Till date, no specific antiviral drug is discovered or developed which is cent-per-cent effective against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative agent of COVID-19. The efficacy of developed vaccines are said to reduce severity of disease, but the mutation led to origin of more infectious variants. In such scenario, medical management of COVID-19 largely depends upon repurposed drugs like azithromycin, remdesivir, chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine and tocilizumab. However, none of these repurposed drugs is devoid of side effects or drug-induced toxicities which may be fatal too sometimes. Scientific research literature on phytochemicals hints that these miracle phytomolecules may not only be useful in direct therapeutic effect but also have potential to reduce or ameliorate the side-effects of current repurposed drugs used in treatment of COVID-19. This review critically elaborates the side-effects of COVID-19 drugs and the six potential phytochemicals, viz., quercetin, baicalein, kaempferol, curcumin, catechins and gingerols which have potentials to ameliorate such side-effects.

Social restrictions during the COVID-19 pandemic have stressed AYA relationships and may cut them off from sources of support. AYA have been shown to respond to relationship stressors with behaviors that increase STI risk. This work examines whether relationship stressors (jealousy and worry about the relationship) exacerbate violence and STI risk among urban AYA during the COVID-19 pandemic.MethodsParticipants from four sexual and reproductive health studies in Baltimore, Maryland (USA) were invited to complete a cross-sectional telephone survey on relationship experiences/sexual behavior during the pandemic. March 16, 2020 ‘stay-at-home’ order was used to define the pandemic period. Partner support, jealousy, worry about the relationship making it through the pandemic, current DV, change in DV during pandemic, and condom use at last sex were evaluated using regression analyses. Data collection is still underway in 2021.ResultsOf 194 participants surveyed, mean (sd) age 22.7 (2.8) years, 61% were in a romantic/sexual relationship. Of these, 14% reported current TDV, 6% experienced an increase in DV, 66% did not use a condom at last sex. AYA who worried their relationship would not make it through the pandemic were more likely to experience DV (OR: 5.64, 95%CI: 1.69, 18.9). AYA who felt jealous of other people their partner was talking to/hanging out with during the pandemic were more likely to experience DV (OR: 4.51, 95%CI: 1.39, 14.6). Greater partner support was associated with experiencing less DV (OR: 0.71, 95%CI: 0.56, 0.90). Relationship stressors were not associated with condom use.ConclusionsRelationship insecurity exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic may increase risk for DV among AYA.

Long-term infection control practices may increase the psychological stress on workers, and conversely, inadequate infection control practices at the working place may increase the fear of infection. This study aimed to determine the relationship between infection control practices at the workplace and employee mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic in Japan. Methods: This study was conducted in December 2020 and February 2021. The participants had undergone a preliminary survey, which revealed that they were in good mental health. Their psychological distress was investigated via a second survey, and the factors associated with distress were studied using a logistic model. Results: The results of the second survey indicated that 15.1% of participants demonstrated psychological distress. This was associated with leave-of-absence instructions, instructions for shortening business hours, and requests to avoid the workplace in case of any symptoms. Conclusion: The study found that while some infection control practices reduce workers' distress, others worsen it. Employers need to consider infection control practices as well as the worsening mental health of employees following a decrease in income caused by such measures. Follow-up studies may be necessary to clarify the long-term effects on workers' mental health.","Kodama, T.; Ishimaru, T.; Tateishi, S.; Hino, A.; Tsuji, M.; OGami, A.; Nagata, T.; Matsuda, S.; Fujino, Y.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.10.05.21264597v1?rss=1,696

Participants Data from 633 adults belonging to ethnic minority groups who took part in the study from 23 July 2020 to 14 June 2021 were included. Experiences of racial/ethnic discrimination occurring since the start of the first lockdown were collected in the last week of July 2020. Structural equation modelling was used to model the direct effect of racial/ethnic discrimination on covid-19 vaccine refusal, as well as the indirect effects through low trust in the central UK government and the UK health service to handle the pandemic. The model adjusted for a range of demographic and covid-19-related covariates. Main outcome measures Data on covid-19 vaccination status was collected from 23 December 2020 to 14 June 2021 and operationalised as having had or agreed to have at least one dose versus having been offered but turned it down (refusal). Results Nearly one in ten (6.7%) who had refused a covid-19 vaccine reported having experienced racial/ethnic discrimination in a medical setting since the start of the pandemic and had experienced twice as many incidents of racial/ethnic discrimination than those who had accepted the vaccine. The total effect of racial/ethnic discrimination on refusing a covid-19 vaccine was nearly 4-fold (odds ratio [OR] = 3.9, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.4 to 10.9) and was mediated by low trust in the health system to handle the pandemic (indirect effect: OR = 2.5, 95% CI = 1.1 to 5.4). Conclusions Findings underscore the importance of addressing racial/ethnic discrimination in order to increase covid-19 vaccine uptake amongst ethnic minority adults.

To follow the strict directives given by the government, the businesses have to implement a cost-effective approach to ensure that all its employers wear a face mask and help to control the spread of coronavirus. The proposed solution consists of an automatic face mask detection system that eliminates the need of an employee at the entrance. The working model detects a face mask in every person by analysing each frame of the video and alert through security mail when the mask is not detected. Our proposed system is designed using the Convolution Neural Network (CNN) model for mask detection and image subtraction technique to recognise the faces with mask. The scope of the project pertains to avoid the entry of unauthorized people into an organization by recognizing the face despite the presence of a mask. The model shows an accuracy of 99.82% on a custom dataset.

Participants were invited via social media posts to complete a short anonymous online survey during the 2-week window between the Level 4 and Level 3 lockdowns in May 2020. Of the 121 respondents who identified their gender, 98 were female, with just over one third of all respondents indicating their use of natural supplements had increased during lockdown in an effort to minimise the risk of falling ill with COVID-19. When supplements were taken, there was a wide perceived benefit that the supplements helped them in some way. Supplements were mainly purchased from supermarkets or pharmacies, with most people not telling their registered heath professional they were taking natural therapies or supplements. As the risk of community spread was relatively low compared to many other Western countries, this may have affected decisions people were making around taking perceived immune-boosting natural supplements.","Maddocks, W.",Australian Journal of Herbal and Naturopathic Medicine,https://doi.org/10.33235/ajhnm.33.2.56-60,696

Hypothesis: We hypothesize that AA have an excess of comorbid conditions compared to WA accounting for the disparity in COVID-19 infection and death. Methods: We examined 67,094 COVID-19 cases with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 and compared them to 135,188 controls (2:1 match by age, sex, and zip code) representing a state-wide sample of healthcare recipients from the 'OneFlorida' research consortium through August 3, 2020. We assessed the prevalence of preexisting comorbid conditions (e.g. cardiovascular disease, cancer), behavioral risk factors, and health outcomes in the electronic health records of COVID-19 cases compared to controls. Results: Cases included 25,443 (37.9%) WA, 11,709 (17.5%) AA, and 16,119 (24%) Hispanic Americans (HA). Among cases, there was a significant increase in the prevalence of several cardiovascular comorbidities in AA vs. WA, such as hypertension, diabetes, heart failure, and stroke, but not for common cancers, liver disease, and COPD (Table 1). Likewise, smoking and BMI were higher in AA. Similar disparities were also appreciated in matched controls. Compared to WA, AA and HA had higher odds of becoming infected with COVID-19 (Unadjusted OR, 1.08;CI [1.05-1.11]and OR, 1.17;[1.15-1.2]) respectively. The prevalence of severe COVID-19 outcomes (intubation and death) was higher in AA (3.6 and 2.7%) than WA (2.5% and 2.3%) or HA (1.3 and 1.4%),respectively. Conclusions: Excess comorbidities for cardiometabolic diseases are present in this population-based sample of COVID-19 cases and controls. Careful mediation analyses will determine whetherthese differences in cardiovascular comorbidities alone account for disparities in COVID-19 in AApatients. Such data would be important to identify high-risk subgroups benefitting from enhancedpreventive and early therapeutic interventions.","Dasa, O.; Cohen, S. A.; Zheng, Y.; Sajdeya, R.; Taha, M.

We propose a model in which individuals that are infected with one disease are more likely to acquire the second disease, both diseases following the susceptible-infected-susceptible reaction scheme. We analyze cooperative coinfection in stochastic network models as well as the idealized, well-mixed mean field system and show that cooperative mechanisms dramatically change the nature of phase transitions compared to single disease dynamics. We show that, generically, cooperative coinfection exhibits discontinuous transitions from the disease free to high prevalence state when a critical transmission rate is crossed. Furthermore, cooperative coinfection exhibits two distinct critical points, one for outbreaks the second one for eradication that can be substantially lower. This implies that cooperative coinfection exhibits hysteresis in its response to changing effective transmission rates or equivalently the basic reproduction number. We compute these critical parameters as a function of a cooperativity coefficient in the well-mixed mean field system. We finally investigate a spatially extended version of the model and show that cooperative interactions between diseases change the general wave propagation properties of conventional spreading phenomena of single diseases. The presented work may serve as a starting and reference point for a more comprehensive understanding of interacting diseases that spread in populations.","Chen, Li; Ghanbarnejad, Fakhteh; Brockmann, Dirk",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1603.09082v1.pdf,696
181818,The emergence of highly fit SARS-CoV-2 variants accelerated by epistasis and caused by recombination,2021-08-24,"Background Antimicrobial resistance is one of the major challenges affecting public health. It is mostly due to the continuous emergence of extended-spectrum β-lactamase from various environments followed by their rapid dissemination and selection in clinical settings. The warming of Earth’s climate is the other global threat facing human society, in particular with the Arctic regions experiencing a twice faster warming than the global average and permafrost affected by widespread thawing. A potentially dreadful combination of these two threats would be the release and dispersion of harmful microbes that have remained confined to largely uninhabited Arctic regions, or are stored dormant in permafrost. Methods Environmental DNA was isolated from 12 soil samples from various Arctic and subarctic pristine regions in Siberia (Yakutia and Kamchatka), including nine permafrost samples collected at various depths. The large datasets obtained from high throughput sequencing was assembled in contigs and their protein-gene contents predicted. We used exhaustive similarity searches to perform taxonomical assignments of bacterial, archaeal, and eukaryotic organisms, as well as DNA viruses. In addition, we specifically identified β-lactamase genes and their prevalence per bacterial genome estimated through the detection of two universal single copy genes. Findings A total of 9.217 1011 bp were exploited, leading to a total of 525,313 contigs at least 5kb in size. The DNA content of the various samples was found to be highly variable, not strictly correlated with the depth or radio-carbon-based deposit age, and most likely linked to the global density of microbes trapped in the corresponding permafrost layers. Bacteria account for more than 90% of the contigs in most samples, followed by Eukaryotes and Archaea (always lower than 10%). Viruses represented less than 2% of all contigs in all samples. The taxonomic profiles of surface cryosoils and deep permafrost samples exhibited a high diversity, including between permafrost samples originating from various depths in the same borehole. In all samples, bacterial contigs carrying different β-lactamases from class A to D were identified. Interpretation No clear common taxonomic feature could be found shared by surface cryosoils or ancient permafrost layers. However, most samples (9/12) exhibited a high frequency of β-lactamase genes, with an estimated average close to 1 copy/bacterial genome. In addition to the well-documented reactivation of infectious ancient pathogens (bacteria, viruses, protozoa), we show now that global warming could contribute to the emergence of new antibiotic resistances through the mobilization by contemporary bacteria of ancient DNA released from thawing permafrost.

Despite efforts by the health care sector to develop health system solutions to improve transitions, problems persist. Research on transitional support has predominantly focused on services delivered by health care professionals; the evidence for services provided by lay navigators or volunteers in supporting people transitioning from hospital to home has not been synthesized to guide practice, policy or future research. Aim: This is a protocol for a scoping review that will examine the role and contributions of voluntary sector personnel and services to support transitions from hospital to home. Methods: Using the well-established scoping review methodology outlined by Arksey and OMalley a six-stage study is outlined (1) identifying the research question, (2) identifying relevant studies, (3) selecting studies, (4) charting the data, (5) collating, summarizing and reporting the results, and (6) providing consultation. The search strategy, designed by an information scientist, is applied to ten databases reflecting empirical and grey literature sources. A two-stage screening process will be used to determine eligibility of articles. To be included in the review, articles must report on a community-based program that engages volunteers in the provisions of services that support adults transitioning from hospital to home. All articles will be independently assessed for eligibility, and data from eligible articles will be abstracted and charted using a standardized form. Extracted data will be analyzed using narrative and descriptive analyses. Research ethics approval is not required for this scoping review. Discussion: This scoping review will map the available literature focused on the contributions of voluntary sector personnel and services to support transitions from hospital to home.","Nelson, M.

If so, do they feel empowered to change those environments? If not, how can psychiatrists be given a role where they can create meaningful change? Finally, how much responsibility can psychiatry usefully take for changing psychopathogenic environments?BackgroundWe define psychopathogenic environments as environments that predispose to mental ill-health. It is the psychological environment we live in - including income, the way we interact with others (e.g. social media, bullying), what we do with our free time, pressures at school and expectations of our peers. It is not discrete events (e.g. trauma) and stretches beyond life at home (where many ACE's occur).Self-harm presentations to medical professionals amongst teenagers are on the rise, Universities report a fivefold increase in disclosure of mental health conditions in the last decade. Here we consider if psychopathogenic environments are part of the cause of these changes.MethodA 10-item questionnaire distributed to Child and Adolescent Psychiatrists in NHS Lothian, NHS Grampian and Manchester University NHS Trust via a consultant in each Trust.ResultAll 14 respondents said psychopathogenic environments are “very important” contributors to mental ill-health. 13/14 say the environments have got worse in the last 10 years. 13/14 responded negatively about whether psychiatrists could change them. When given white space to tackle the problem they suggested changes were needed from Government including against poverty / inequality, education, public health nudges, more resources, MDT working and better access to leisure facilities. Given specific choices, 11/14 identified influencing Government as a major way forward.ConclusionThis group of psychiatrists believe psychopathogenic environments are;1) a very important contributor to mental ill-health 2) getting worse but 3) feel largely powerless to tackle it. It is a problem they think is important and want to engage in, but lack time, resources and struggle with the complexity of the problem. How therefore, can psychiatrist show leadership in this area? The two perspectives to consider how to empower psychiatrists to help create change are 1) how they can influence the environment for individual patients, 2) how they can influence public policy and government to make wider changes.Is this the job of psychiatrists? Not alone, but as agents they have a unique insight and authority as both a lens for and director of these environments.","Cockburn, Alastair Morris Jane",BJPsych Open,https://doi.org/10.1192/bjo.2021.653,696

Furthermore, antibodies are key detection reagents in research and diagnostics. The increasing demand for antibodies with regards to amount and quality resulted in the development of a variety of recombinant production systems employing gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria, yeast and filamentous fungi, insect cell lines as well as mammalian cell lines. More recently, antibodies were also successfully produced in transgenic plants and animals. Currently, the production of recombinant antibodies for therapy is performed in mammalian cell lines to reduce the risk of immunogenicity caused by non-human post-translational modifications, in particular glycosylation. However, novel strategies already allow human-like glycosylation patterns in yeast, insect cell lines and transgenic plants. Furthermore, therapeutic strategies not requiring glycosylation of the Fc portion have been conceived, most prominently using bispecific antibodies or scFv fusion proteins, which can be produced in bacteria. Here, we review all current antibody production systems considering their advantages and limitations with respect to intended applications.","Schirrmann, Thomas; Al-Halabi, Laila; Dübel, Stefan; Hust, Michael",Frontiers in bioscience : a journal and virtual library,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18508530/,696

The novel corona virus may affect the kidneys mainly as acute kidney injury (AKI). Also, the outcome of COVID-19 may be different in patients with underlying kidney disease. The aim of this study was to compare the outcome of COVID-19 in patients with and without underlying kidney disease. METHODS This was a retrospective study on 659 hospitalized COVID-19 patients in six centers of Iran. Patients were classified into kidney (chronic kidney disease (CKD), end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) or kidney transplantation) and non-kidney groups. The clinical conditions and laboratory data were extracted from the charts. Outcome was defined as death during hospitalization or within 30 days of discharge. RESULTS Among 659 COVID-19 patients (mean age: 60.7 ± 16.4, 56% male), 208 were in the kidney group (86 ESKD, 35 kidney transplants, and 87 CKD patients). AKI occurred in 41.8%. Incidence of AKI was 34.7% in non-kidney, 74.7% in CKD, and 51.4% in kidney transplant patients (P < .001). Totally 178 patients (27%) died and mortality rate was significantly higher in CKD patients (50.6 vs. 23.4%, P < .001). AKI was associated with increased mortality rate (OR = 2.588, CI: 1.707 to 3.925). Initial glomerular filtration rate (GFR) < 44.2 mL/min and elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and C-reactive protein (CRP) had significant association with mortality. CONCLUSION We showed a higher mortality rate in COVID-19 patients with AKI and CKD.

In the case of cytostatics such as doxorubicin, carrier colloid systems as human serum albumin (HSA) nanoparticles, may increase their therapeutic efficiency and decrease their side-effects (toxicity) and any potential multidrug resistance. In the present study, doxorubicin, as a widely used antineoplastic agent, was incorporated into the matrix of human serum albumin and three different particle-sized doxorubicin-loaded HSA nanoparticles were prepared, using a previously described desolvation method. Our objective was to find out if different particle sizes of colloid carriers can allow regarding the given cytostatic agent. MATERIAL AND METHODS The three prepared nanoparticles were labelled using technetium (Tc-99m) and were tested for their physicochemical colloidal quality, fluctuations, and radiochemical stability. Biodistribution of different-sized radiolabelled colloids were determined by means of scintigraphic imaging studies in healthy male Wistar rats. Images were taken by gamma camera at several times and organ uptakes were estimated by quantitative ROI analysis. RESULTS In vitro measurements showed that more than 95% of doxorubicin proportion was permanently adsorbed to human serum albumin. Radiolabelled doxorubicin-loaded particles had high-degree and durable labelling efficiency and particle size stability. Biodistribution results had a close correlation to earlier described results of radiocolloids in similar particle size ranges. In vivo examinations verified that colloid carriers have insignificant size fluctuations after an intravenous application and they show the proper distribution according to their particle size. CONCLUSIONS Our investigations verified that different and stable particle sizes make drug carrier HSA nanoparticles possible to apply different drug targeting in a potential clinical use.","Polyak, Andras; Palade, Elena Alina; Balogh, Lajos; Postenyi, Zita; Haasz, Veronika; Janoki, Gergely; Janoki, Gyozo A",Nuclear medicine review.

200241,Engineered nanomaterials as fighters against SARS-CoV-2: The way to control and treat pandemics,2020,"Loosening of the hip joint prosthesis is considered as one of the most significant postoperative complications in recent years. The laboratory diagnostic procedure used to differentiate periprosthetic infection from aseptic loosening is very difficult because of the biofilm which microorganisms form on the implant surface. The purpose of this research was to evaluate the level of concordance between clinical classification of implant loosening among 50 patients subjected to reimplantation procedure and laboratory investigation of PJI including microbiological culture results and the levels of inflammatory markers assessed in the patients' synovial fluid samples, serum, and full blood. The synovial fluid was collected for leukocyte count, differential cell count, and culture on standard media. The levels of systemic inflammation markers such as the ESR and CRP concentration were determined in serum and full blood. Tissue samples were collected for microbiological studies. Components from endoprostheses were exposed to ultrasound in a process called sonication. Among the parameters measured in serum and full blood the levels of ESR and CRP were higher in the septic group of patients. Cytologic analysis of synovial fluid was in correlation with microbiologic identification. The most frequent isolated bacteria was Staphylococcus epidermidis. Culture results from materials such as synovial fluid, sonicate and tissues are crucial to establish the infectious aetiology of the loosening. Microscopic analysis of synovial fluid represents a simple, rapid and accurate method for differentiating PJI from aseptic failure. Sonication increases detection of the infectious process, and culture results are in correlation with the cytologic analysis of synovial fluid.","Strzelec-Nowak, Dagmara; Kozioł-Montewka, Maria; Niedźwiadek, Justyna; Bogut, Agnieszka; Blacha, Jan; Mazurkiewicz, Tomasz",Polish journal of microbiology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26373172/,696
200362,SARS-CoV-2 nach Lungentransplantation: Eine Fallserie mit heterogenen Merkmalen im CT,2020,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is an emerging infectious disease associated with a high rate of mortality. The SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) has been identified as the etiological agent of the disease. Although public health procedures have been effective in combating the spread of SARS, concern remains about the possibility of a recurrence. Various approaches are being pursued for the development of efficacious therapeutics. One promising approach is to develop small molecule inhibitors of the essential major polyprotein processing protease 3Clpro. Here we report a complete description of the tetrapeptide substrate specificity of 3Clpro using fully degenerate peptide libraries consisting of all 160,000 possible naturally occurring tetrapeptides. The substrate specificity data show the expected P1-Gln P2-Leu specificity and elucidate a novel preference for P1-His containing substrates equal to the expected preference for P1-Gln. These data were then used to develop optimal substrates for a high-throughput screen of a 2000 compound small-molecule inhibitor library consisting of known cysteine protease inhibitor scaffolds. We also report the 1.8 A X-ray crystal structure of 3Clpro bound to an irreversible inhibitor. This inhibitor, an alpha,beta-epoxyketone, inhibits 3Clpro with a k3/Ki of 0.002 microM(-1) s(-1) in a mode consistent with the substrate specificity data. Finally, we report the successful rational improvement of this scaffold with second generation inhibitors. These data provide the foundation for a rational small-molecule inhibitor design effort based upon the inhibitor scaffold identified, the crystal structure of the complex, and a more complete understanding of P1-P4 substrate specificity.","Goetz, D H; Choe, Y; Hansell, E; Chen, Y T; McDowell, M; Jonsson, C B; Roush, W R; McKerrow, J; Craik, C S",Biochemistry,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17605471/,696

The interaction between certain risk factors and a genetic predisposition may determine whether this disease will develop in a particular individual. The rationale for use of joint-sparing procedures in the treatment of this disease is based on radiographic measurements and findings with other imaging modalities. Early diagnosis and intervention prior to collapse of the femoral head is key to a successful outcome of joint-preserving procedures. The results of joint-preserving procedures are less satisfactory than the results of total hip arthroplasty for femoral heads that have already collapsed. New pharmacological measures as well as the use of growth and differentiation factors for the prevention and treatment of this disease may eventually alter our treatment approach, but it is necessary to await results of clinical research with long-term follow-up of these patients.","Mont, Michael A; Jones, Lynne C; Hungerford, David S",The Journal of bone and joint surgery.

However, it is not known how accurate CPC coding at triage is, or whether coding accuracy varies by patient characteristics. The aim of this study was to determine the accuracy of CPC coding. METHOD We compared the real-time triage recorded CPC with the presenting complaints recorded in medical notes by the treating clinician. Agreement was determined by exact CPC matches and the kappa statistic. RESULTS From 1,000 consecutive presentations 852 were eligible (89 CPCs). Real-time CPC agreed with clinical notes in 514/852 (60.3%) cases. When real-time free text comments were included, agreement was 732/852 (85.9%). There were no differences by age, sex or ethnicity. Agreement for the common CPCs: 'trauma' (21%); 'abdominal pain' (11%), 'chest pain' 87 (10%) and 'shortness of breath' (8%) was substantial, k=0.66 (95% CI: 0.61, 0.70). Use of non-specific CPC such as 'referral for investigation' (5%) and 'general weakness/fatigue/unwell' (2%) was uncommon but associated with poor agreement. CONCLUSION The accuracy of real-time coding for CPC using SNOMED-CT was reasonable, except for non-specific CPCs, which should be avoided where possible.","Jones, Peter G; Dance, Annette; Shah, Nikhar",The New Zealand medical journal,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33332341/,696

The anti-SARS-coronavirus specific antibody levels in 156 SARS patients were measured with ELISA. The results showed that the total positive rates of IgG and IgM were 75.6% and 41.7% respectively, and the negative rate of both IgG and IgM was 23.7%. The average titers of IgG and IgM antibody in positive samples were 18.23 +/- 24.72 and 2.18 +/- 1.13, respectively. There was no significant correlation between the titers of IgG/IgM and sex, age, course of diseases and duration of body temperature recovery. It was concluded that not all SARS patients could produce the anti-SARS-coronavirus specific antibody. The titers of the anti-body are diversified even if the antibodies have been emerged in them. In order to obtain effective anti-serum, the titers of antibody must be tested just before collection of convalescent serum, and it ensures the therapeutic effect and provides a measurable index for clinical transfusion.","Wang, Hai-Bao; Liu, Jing-Han; Ouyang, Xi-Lin; Yu, Yang; Ma, Shu-Xuan; Li, Xi-Jin; Lu, Liu-Cai; Tian, Ya-Ping; Liu, Hong-Ying; Xu, Hong-Min; Yao, Wei",Zhongguo shi yan xue ye xue za zhi,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14575532/,696

Methods: Descriptive study of the challenges faced in eye banking during the lockdown, and practices adopted to overcome the critical aspects in the clinical care of patients who presented with emergency corneal diseases requiring keratoplasty. Results: Complete lockdown orders from the Indian government, as a strategy to control the Coronavirus pandemic, resulted in drastic reduction of all types of elective corneal transplants and eye banking activities from March 24, 2020 to May 31, 2020. The sudden cessation of eye banking resulted in an acute demand and supply imbalance of fresh donor corneas for transplants during this time. Our network of eye banks addressed this issue by adopting glycerol preservation of donor corneas, which were subsequently utilized for tectonic penetrating keratoplasty. The donor cornea retrieval was resumed in a strategized manner 3 weeks prior to the date of exit of the lockdown, with modified guidelines on donor suitability, screening, retrieval, processing, and harvesting from various sources. A triage of keratoplasty priority was formulated to tide over the post lockdown shortage of corneas. We performed 31 therapeutic keratoplasties during the nationwide lockdown among our network of tertiary eye care centers. Conclusion: The study highlights the approach and strategies to manage and tide over an unprecedented crisis situation faced by corneal surgeons in general and, specifically, the eye banking community.","Roy, Arvind; Das, Sujata; Chaurasia, Sunita; Fernandes, Merle; Murthy, Somasheila",Indian J Ophthalmol,,696

Despite these unique circumstances, results of several interesting studies in the field of breast cancer (BC) were reported. While overall survival data are still missing, KEYNOTE-355 suggests significant activity of pembrolizumab when added to first-line chemotherapy in metastatic triple-negative breast cancer. TBCRC 048 evaluated the role of olaparib in homologous recombination deficient tumours due to genomic alterations other than germline BRCA1/2 mutations; clinically relevant activity was reported in patients with germline PALB2 and somatic BRCA1/2 mutations. In HER2-positive early stage disease, different strategies of chemotherapy de-escalation are under investigation, but the optimal approach is still not well defined. Updated results from the HER2CLIMB trial show that the third-generation HER2 tyrosine-kinase inhibitor tucatinib in combination with trastuzumab and capecitabine is the new standard-of-care for pretreated patients with HER2-positive metastatic BC with active brain metastases. Results from BYLieve supports the notion that the combination of endocrine therapy with the PIK3Ca inhibitor alpelisib is a reasonable treatment approach in hormone-receptor positive/HER2-negative BC after prior CDK4/6-inhibitor therapy. Finally, the ECOG-ACRIN 2108 trial failed to show a benefit for early surgery of the primary tumour in patients with metastatic BC.","Bartsch, Rupert",Memo,,696
211799,SARS-CoV-2: Einfluss von Diabetes auf ACE2 als Schlüsselfaktor einer Infektion,2020,"BACKGROUND: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has significantly disrupted the delivery of healthcare. Although most nonurgent ophthalmology visits at Boston Children's Hospital were canceled, premature infants at risk for retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) still required timely, in-person care during the initial 3-month period of the infection surge in Massachusetts. The purpose of the current study was to report our protocols for mitigating risk of exposure to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) between infants and eye care providers and to compare examination rates and results with the same 3-month period in 2019. METHODS: During the infection surge, we added new infection control measures and strengthened existing ones. Additional personal protective equipment was used, and the number of ophthalmologists rotating in the three high-capacity NICUs we service was limited. RESULTS: More infants required ROP examinations during the study period in 2020 than in the same period in 2019, but fewer examinations were performed. There were no cases of missed progression to severe ROP during this time and no known transmission of SARS-CoV-2 between ROP patients and ophthalmology staff. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, effective ROP care was safely provided during the COVID-19 pandemic, and contact with this vulnerable population was minimized.","Mantagos, Iason S; Wu, Carolyn; Griffith, Joseph F; Jastrzembski, Benjamin G; Gonzalez, Efren; Goldstein, Samantha; Pearlo, Lori; Vanderveen, Deborah K",,,696

Individuals with previous clinical conditions that usually enroll gut dysbiosis have been identified as being at high risk to develop more severe infectious phenotypes. Actually, intestinal dysbiosis has been observed in infected patients and potentially linked to systemic hyperinflammation. These observations suggest that a previous gut dysbiosis may be aggravated by SARS-CoV-2 infection and related to progression of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) into more severe stages. While COVID-19's pathophysiology is not fully understood, it seems relevant to consider the interactions of candidate therapeutic drugs with the host, gut microbiota, and SARS-CoV-2. Here we summarize scientific evidence supporting the potential relevance of these interactions and suggest that unfavorable clinical data on hydroxychloroquine administration in COVID-19 may have been influenced by the dose provided and its impact on gut dysbiosis. The proposition is based on preliminary data on gut microbiota composition from individuals with inactive systemic lupus erythematosus under exclusive continuous hydroxychloroquine treatment, displaying a direct correlation between drug doses and markers typically associated with gut dysbiosis.","Balmant, Bianca D; Torrinhas, Raquel S; Rocha, Ilanna M; Fonseca, Danielle C; Formiga, Francisco F C; Bonfá, Eloisa S D O; Borba, Eduardo F; Waitzberg, Dan L",Nutrition,,696

Our objective was to examine the odds of neurological and psychiatric adverse reactions to BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech) and ChAdOx1 (Oxford-AstraZeneca) COVID-19 vaccines. MethodsWe analyzed all Adverse Vaccine Reaction reports to the United Kingdom Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency between December 9, 2020 and June 30, 2021 that mentioned the BNT162b2 or ChAdOx1 vaccines. We compared the rates of adverse neurological and psychiatric reactions with ChAdOx1 to those with BNT162b2. P-values were obtained by a Bonferroni-adjusted Z-test for proportions. ResultsAs of June 30, 2021, 53.2 M doses of ChAdOx1 and 46.1 M doses of BNT162b2 had been administered. We extracted information from 300,518 distinct reports. The number of individual adverse neurologic or psychiatric reaction reports were less than 200/M doses administered, except headache which was reported in 1,550 and 395 cases/M doses of ChAdOx1 and BNT162b2, respectively. Compared to BNT162b2, cerebral hemorrhagic or thrombotic events, headaches and migraines, Guillain-Barre syndrome and paresthesias, tremor and freezing, delirium, hallucinations, nervousness, poor sleep quality, and postural dizziness were more frequently reported with ChAdOx1. Reactions more frequently reported with BNT162b2 than ChAdOx1 were Bells palsy, facial paralysis, dysgeusia, anxiety, and presyncope or syncope. ConclusionSignificant differences in the neurologic and psychiatric adverse event profiles of the ChAdOx1 and BNT162b2 vaccines may exist, emphasizing the need for additional research. The beneficial and protective effects of the COVID-19 vaccines far outweigh the low potential risk of neurologic and psychiatric reactions.","Perez-Lloret, Santiago; Petrovsky, Nikolai; Alami, Abdallah; Crispo, James; Mattison, Donald; Otero-Losadsa, Matilde; Capani, Francisco; Krewski, Daniel",,,696

Symptoms such as a cough, dyspnea, and fever are common to a large number of inflammatory, infectious, or neoplastic diseases. During the COVID-19 pandemic it is essential to limit the use of hospital services and inappropriate diagnostic techniques. A particular radiological pattern can orient the clinical and laboratory scenario and guide the diagnostic workup. A 58-year-old woman was admitted to our COVID-19 unit for suspected coronavirus infection. She was complaining of worsening dyspnea, tachycardia, and low grade fever. A chest X-ray showed diffuse, alveolar, and interstitial lung involvement with micronodules tending to coalescence. This radiographic pattern known as “galaxy sign”, consistent with diffuse, coalescing nodular miliary pulmonary involvement, simulating a non-specific alveolar opacification of the lungs is typical of a few pneumological differential diagnoses, represented by sarcoidosis, tuberculosis, pneumoconiosis, and metastatic lesions, and virtually excludes an interstitial viral pneumonitis.

METHODS: Epidemiological surveillance at the Cà Foncello Hospital (Veneto, Italy) since 24 February 2020 to 24 April 2020 when the municipality of Treviso was hit by the Covid-19 outbreak. The number of naso-pharigeal (NP) swabs performed was 7010. RESULTS: The number of infected among healthcare workers was 209/ 3924 (5.32%): medical doctors: 28 cases / 498 (5.6%). None among ophthalmologists; specialized nurses: 86/1294 (6.4%) None in the ophthalmic unit; intermediate care technicians: 68/463 (14.7%). The 46% of the positive tested were asymptomatic. We share key suggested actions for the reorganization in ophthalmological services: be part of a global epidemiological local strategy of containment (Testing, Tracing, Treating); protect your department: Keep on screening patients by telephone interview before entering the hospital; promote continuous and appropriate use of PPE both for doctors and for patients; make any effort to obtain a continuous flow of patients in every line of the ophthalmic service; treat appropriately any single patient with vision threatening condition; avoid unnecessary or futile testings and examinations. CONCLUSION: The Treviso model shows that it is possible and safe to keep on performing high risk hospital activities like ophthalmology, even in the epicenter of covid outbreak, if adequate actions are performed. We discuss about the value of NP swabs and serological tests as a strategy in case of a second wave of infections.","Grosso, Andrea; Rigoli, Roberto; Formentini, Stefano; Di Perri, Giovanni; Scotton, Piergiorgio; Dapavo, Giancarlo; Fioretto, Mauro; Scarpa, Giuseppe",Eur J Ophthalmol,,696

In this study we aim to investigate and evaluate the impact of the pandemic on residents as well as residency training programs. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study including a survey of 43 questions prepared on Google forms and electronically distributed among a convenience sample of residents training at a tertiary center in North Jordan during the COVID-19 pandemic. Data were collected in the period between October 30th and November 8th of 2020. The survey included questions that addressed the impact of the pandemic on residents' health as well as training programs. The study participants included residents in training at KAUH in 2020 and were stratified according to the type of residency program (surgical residents (SRs) and non-surgical residents (NSRs)). Statistical methods included descriptive analysis, Chi-square or Fisher's exact test, Mann Whitney U test, and Cramer's V and r statistics as measures of effect sizes. RESULTS: Of all 430 residents, 255 (59%) responded to the survey. A total of 17 (7%) of residents reported being infected with COVID-19 and a significant difference was reported between SRs and NSRs (10% vs 4%, V = .124 ""small effect"" (95% CI; .017-.229), p = 0.048). Approximately, 106 (42%) reported a decrease in the number of staff working at the clinic and 164 (64%) reported limited access to personal protective equipment during the pandemic. On a 4-point Likert scale for the feeling of anxiety, the median was 2 (2-3 IQR) in the NSRs group, vs 2 (1-2 IQR) in the SRs groups, with the NSRs being more likely to feel anxious (r = 0.13 ""small effect"" (95% CI; 0.007-0.249), p = .044). Similarly, the proportion of residents who reported feeling anxious about an inadequacy of protective equipment in the work area was significantly greater in the NSRs group (90.3% vs 75.2%; V = .201 ""small effect"" (95% CI; .078-.313), p = .001), as well as the proportion of residents who reported feeling increased stress and anxiety between colleagues being also significantly higher in the NSRs group (88.1% vs 76%; V = .158 ""small effect"" (95% CI; .032-.279), p = .012). CONCLUSION: The burden of the ongoing pandemic on the mental health status of residents is very alarming and so providing residents with psychological counseling and support is needed. Also, critical implications on the flow of residency training programs have been noticed.

232148,Time-lapse sentinel surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 spread in India,2020,"Introduction: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections, resulting in a range of clinical manifestations and outcomes. Laboratory and immunological alterations have been considered as potential markers of disease severity and clinical evolution. Type I interferons (IFN-I), mainly represented by IFN-&#945; and ß, are a group of cytokines with an important function in antiviral responses and have played a complex role in COVID-19. Some studies have demonstrated that IFN-I levels and interferon response is elevated in mild cases, while other studies have noted this in severe cases. The involvement of IFN-I on the pathogenesis and outcomes of SARS-CoV-2 infection remains unclear. In this study, we summarize the available evidence of the association of plasma protein levels of type I IFN with the severity of COVID-19. Methods: The PRISMA checklist guided the reporting of the data. A systematic search of the MEDLINE (PubMed), EMBASE, and Web of Science databases was performed up to March of 2021, looking for articles that evaluated plasma protein levels of IFN-I in mild, severe, or critical COVID-19 patients. Comparative meta-analyses with random effects were performed to compare the standardized mean differences in plasma protein levels of IFN-I of mild versus severe and mild versus critical patients. Meta-regressions were performed to test the moderating role of age, sex, time that the IFN-I was measured, and limit of detection of the assay used in the difference between the means.

However, there was a significant difference between healthy individuals and patients with mild disease (SMD = 0.447, 95% CI 0.085 to 0.810, p = 0.016, I2 = 62.89). Conclusions: Peripheral IFN-&#945; cannot be used as a severity marker as it does not determine the clinical status presented by COVID-19 patients.","da Silva, Rafaela Pires; Gonçalves, João Ismael Budelon; Zanin, Rafael Fernandes; Schuch, Felipe Barreto; de Souza, Ana Paula Duarte",Front Immunol,,696

237273,Variants of SARS-COV-2 and the Death Toll,2021,"IntroductionDisparities and their geospatial patterns exist in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) morbidity and mortality for people who are engaged with clinical care. However, studies centered on viral infection cases are scarce. It remains unclear with respect to the disparity structure, its geospatial characteristics, and the pre-infection determinants of risk (PIDRs) for people with the infection. This work aimed to assess the geospatial associations between PIDRs and COVID-19 infection at the county level in South Carolina by different timepoints during the pandemic. MethodWe used global models including spatial error model (SEM), spatial lag model (SLM), and conditional autoregressive model (CAR), as well as geographically weighted regression model (GWR) as a local model to examine the associations between COVID-19 infection rate and PIDRs. The data were retrieved from multiple sources including USAFacts, US Census Bureau, and Population Estimates Program. ResultsThe percentage of males and the percentage of the unemployed population were statistically significant (p values < 0.05) with positive coefficients in the three global models (SEM, SLM, CAR) throughout the time. The percentage of white population and obesity rate showed divergent spatial correlations at different times of the pandemic. GWR models consistently have a better model fit than global models, suggesting non-stationary correlations between a region and its neighbors. ConclusionCharacterized by temporal-geospatial patterns, disparities and their PIDRs exist in COVID-19 incidence at the county level in South Carolina. The temporal-geospatial structure of disparities and their PIDRs found in COVID-19 incidence are different from mortality and morbidity for patients who are connected with clinical care. Our findings provided important evidence for prioritizing different populations and developing tailored interventions at different times of the pandemic. These findings provided implications on containing early viral transmission and mitigating consequences of infectious disease outbreaks for possible future pandemics.","Lyu, Tianchu; Hair, Nicole; Yell, Nicholas; Li, Zhenlong; Qiao, Shan; Liang, Chen; Li, Xiaoming",,,696

237916,Vaccines and SARS-CoV-2 variants: the urgent need for a correlate of protection,2021,"Introduction: Women have historically been under-represented in medical literature, particularly prominent in authorship of invited commentaries. With the instantaneous change in work environment forcing Americans to adapt to working at home, many theorize that women will be more adversely affected due to traditional concepts of women being more responsible for the home in addition to work responsibilities. Objective: Understand how women contributed to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) literature early in the pandemic. Methods: Cross-sectional analysis of manuscripts published in three high-impact U.S. medical journals from February to May 2020 was performed. We used log-binomial regression to examine for an association between COVID-19 status and likelihood of having at least one female first author, and evaluated for effect modification according to whether the manuscript was invited. Results: Among 980 manuscripts, 313 (31.9%) listed at least one female first author, 203 were written on COVID-19 (20.7%), and 144 (14.7%) were invited. There was no association between COVID-19 status and having at least one female first author overall (adjusted risk ratio [RR] 0.93, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.72-1.19). The relationship between COVID-19 status and first-author sex was 0.23 (95% CI 0.06-0.92) for invited manuscripts and 1.04 (95% CI 0.81-1.35) for noninvited manuscripts (p for interaction 0.02). Discussion: We demonstrate that women were not less likely to be first authors on COVID-19 manuscripts but were less likely to be first authors on invited COVID-19 manuscripts. Early career female researchers are the most vulnerable for inability to meet metrics for promotion, accounting for the continued under-representation of women in senior academic roles. COVID-19 has the potential to exacerbate this disparity.","Brown, C.; Novick, T. K.; Jacobs, E. A.",Womens Health Reports,,696

Combined with many trends that were already under way pre-pandemic, the current situation has generated significant disruption and underscored the need for change within and across AMCs. In this article, the authors explore some of the major issues and propose actionable solutions in 3 areas of concentration. First, the impact on medical students is considered, particularly the tradeoffs associated with online learning and the need to place greater pedagogical emphasis on virtual care delivery and other skills that will be increasingly in demand. Solutions described include greater utilization of technology, building more public health knowledge into the curriculum, and partnering with a wide range of academic disciplines. Second, leadership recruiting, vital to long-term success for AMCs, has been complicated by the crisis. Pressures discussed include adapting to the dynamics of competitive physician labor markets as well as attracting candidates with the skill sets to meet the requirements of a shifting AMC leadership landscape. Solutions proposed in this domain include making search processes more focused and streamlined, prioritizing creativity and flexibility as core management capabilities to be sought, and enhancing efforts with assistance from outside advisors. Finally, attention is devoted to the severe financial impact wrought by the pandemic, creating challenges whose resolution is central to planning future AMC directions. Specific challenges include recovery of lost clinical revenue and cash flow, determining how to deal with research funding, and the precarious economic balancing act engendered by the need to continue distance education. A full embrace of telehealth, collaborative policy-making among the many AMC constituencies, and committing fully to being in the vanguard of the transition to value-based care form the solution set offered.","Godley, Bernard F; Lawley, Thomas J; Rubenstein, Arthur; Pizzo, Philip A",Acad. med,,696

This new SARS-CoV-2 virus could share characteristics and an immune response similar to those described for other coronavirus. Given its activity on the interferon pathway, and the manner in which it dysregulates innate immunity, the use of treatments directed at modulating or containing this could be of interest. A narrative review was made of the current evidence about immunity against coronavirus and its applicability to SARS-CoV-2.

241105,An Overview of the Genetic Variations of the SARS-CoV-2 Genomes Isolated in Southeast Asian Countries,2020,"AIMS: Myocardial injury is frequently observed in patients hospitalized with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia. Different cardiac abnormalities have been reported during the acute COVID-19 phase, ranging from infra-clinic elevations of myocardial necrosis biomarkers to acute cardiac dysfunction and myocarditis. There is limited information on late cardiac sequelae in patients who have recovered from acute COVID-19 illness. We aimed to document the presence and quantify the extent of myocardial functional alterations in patients hospitalized 6 months earlier for COVID-19 infection. METHODS AND RESULTS: We conducted a prospective echocardiographic evaluation of 48 patients (mean age 58 ± 13 years, 69% male) hospitalized 6 ± 1 month earlier for a laboratory-confirmed and symptomatic COVID-19. Thirty-two (66.6%) had pre-existing cardiovascular risks factors (systemic hypertension, diabetes, or dyslipidaemia), and three patients (6.2%) had a known prior myocardial infarction. Sixteen patients (33.3%) experienced myocardial injury during the index COVID-19 hospitalization as identified by a rise in cardiac troponin levels. Six months later, 60.4% of patients still reported clinical symptoms including exercise dyspnoea for 56%. Echocardiographic measurements under resting conditions were not different between patients with versus without myocardial injury during the acute COVID-19 phase. In contrast, low-level exercise (25W for 3 min) induced a significant increase in the average E/e' ratio (10.1 ± 4.3 vs. 7.3 ± 11.5, P = 0.01) and the systolic pulmonary artery pressure (33.4 ± 7.8 vs. 25.6 ± 5.3 mmHg, P = 0.02) in patients with myocardial injury during the acute COVID-19 phase. Sensitivity analyses showed that these alterations of left ventricular diastolic markers were observed regardless of whether of cardiovascular risk factors or established cardiac diseases indicating SARS-CoV-2 infection as a primary cause. CONCLUSIONS: Six months after the acute COVID-19 phase, significant cardiac diastolic abnormalities are observed in patients who experienced myocardial injury but not in patients without cardiac involvement.","Fayol, Antoine; Livrozet, Marine; Boutouyrie, Pierre; Khettab, Hakim; Betton, Maureen; Tea, Victoria; Blanchard, Anne; Bruno, Rosa-Maria; Hulot, Jean-Sébastien",ESC Heart Fail,,696

A multinational, cross-sectional, web-based study was performed in six European countries between April and July 2020. The anonymous survey was promoted via social media. In total, 16,063 women participated (including 6661 pregnant and 9402 breastfeeding women). Most responses were collected from Belgium (44%), Norway (18%) and the Netherlands (16%), followed by Switzerland (11%), Ireland (10%) and the UK (3%). Despite differences between countries, COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy was identified among 40-50% of the respondents at the end of the first wave of the pandemic and was higher among pregnant women. Education level and employment status were associated with vaccine hesitancy. The first wave had an adverse impact on pregnancy experiences and disrupted access to health services and breastfeeding support for many women. In the future, access to health care and support should be maintained at all times. Evidence-based and tailored information on COVID-19 vaccines should also be provided to pregnant and breastfeeding women to avoid unfounded concerns about the vaccines and to support shared decision making in this population.","Ceulemans, Michael; Foulon, Veerle; Panchaud, Alice; Winterfeld, Ursula; Pomar, Léo; Lambelet, Valentine; Cleary, Brian; O039,; Shaughnessy, Fergal; Passier, Anneke; Richardson, Jonathan Luke; Allegaert, Karel; Nordeng, Hedvig",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,696

METHODS: An observational cross-sectional study was conducted to evaluate wellbeing perceived by nurses who during the study were on duty in the COVID-19 intensive care unit. The ""Covid-19-Nurse Well-being at Work (NWB) scale"" questionnaire consisting of 72 items divided into 13 sections, was validated and used to collect data. RESULTS: The level of wellbeing perceived by the nurses was very good (4.77; SD 0.83). Differences in the of level of perceived wellbeing were found for ""years of experience"" and the various levels of competence. We found a positive correlation between ""female gender"" and ""nurses' togetherness and collaboration"", a negative correlation between ""male gender"" and ""satisfactory practical organisation of work, and a negative correlation between ""work experience"" and the overall ""level of wellbeing at work. CONCLUSIONS: The reorganisation had positive effects in terms of wellbeing perceived by the nurses. The factors that contributed mostly to the perception of wellbeing were in the area of ""support"", ""communication, and ""socializing with colleagues"".

An increasing body of evidence suggests that patients with the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) might have a heterogeneous spectrum of neurological symptoms METHODS: A systematic search of two databases was performed for studies published up to May 29th, 2020. PRISMA guidelines were followed. RESULTS: We included 19 studies evaluating 12,157 patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 infections. The median age of patients was 50.3 (IQR 11.9), and the rate of male patients was 50.6% (95% CI 49.2-51.6%). The most common reported comorbidities were hypertension and diabetes (31.1%, 95% CI 30-32.3% and 13.5%, 95% CI 12.3-14.8%, respectively). Headache was reported in 7.5% of patients (95% CI 6.6-8.4%), and dizziness in 6.1% (95% CI 5.1-7.1%). Hypo/anosmia, and gustatory dysfunction were reported in 46.8 and 52.3%, of patients, respectively. Symptoms related to muscular injury ranged between 15 and 30%. Three studies reported radiological confirmed acute cerebrovascular disease in 2% of patients (95% CI 1.6-2.4%). CONCLUSIONS: These data support accumulating evidence that a significant proportion of patients with COVID-19 infection develop neurological manifestations, especially olfactory, and gustatory dysfunction. The pathophysiology of this association is under investigation and warrants additional studies, Physicians should be aware of this possible association because during the epidemic period of COVID-19, early recognition of neurologic manifestations otherwise not explained would raise the suspect of acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection.","Di Carlo, Davide Tiziano; Montemurro, Nicola; Petrella, Giandomenico; Siciliano, Gabriele; Ceravolo, Roberto; Perrini, Paolo",J. neurol,,696
246740,Research Methodology to Define the Introduction of the SARS-CoV-2 B.1.429 Variant in Hawaii,2021,"In the current pandemic situation raised due to COVID-19, drug reuse is emerging as the first line of treatment. The viral agent that causes this highly contagious disease and the acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) share high nucleotide similarity. Therefore, it is structurally expected that many existing viral targets are similar to the first SARS-CoV, probably being inhibited by the same compounds. Here, we selected two viral proteins based on their vital role in the viral life cycle: Structure of the main protease SARS-CoV-2 and the structural base of the SARS-CoV-2 protease 3CL, both supporting the entry of the virus into the human host. The approved drugs used were azithromycin, ritonavir, lopinavir, oseltamivir, ivermectin and heparin, which are emerging as promising agents in the fight against COVID-19. Our hypothesis behind molecular coupling studies is to determine the binding affinities of these drugs and to identify the main amino acid residues that play a fundamental role in their mechanism of action. Additional studies on a wide range of FDA-approved drugs, including a few more protein targets, molecular dynamics studies, in vitro and biological in vivo evaluation are needed to identify combination therapy targeted at various stages of the viral life cycle. In our experiment in silico, based mainly on the molecular coupling approach, we investigated six different types of pharmacologically active drugs, aiming at their potential application alone or in combination with the reuse of drugs. The ligands showed stable conformations when analyzing the affinity energy in both proteases: ivermectin forming a stable complex with the two proteases with values -8.727 kcal/mol for Main Protease and -9.784 kcal/mol for protease 3CL, Heparin with values of -7.647 kcal/mol for the Main protease and -7.737 kcal/mol for the 3CL protease. Both conform to the catalytic site of the proteases. Our studies can provide an insight into the possible interactions between ligands and receptors, through better conformation. The ligands ivermectin, heparin and ritonavir showed stable conformations. Our in-silica docking data shows that the drugs we have identified can bind to the binding compartment of both proteases, this strongly supports our hypothesis that the development of a single antiviral agent targeting Main protease, or 3CL protease, or an agent used in combination with other potential therapies, it could provide an effective line of defense against diseases associated with coronaviruses.","Arouche, Tiago da Silva; Martins, Anderson Yuri; Ramalho, Teodorico de Castro; Júnior, Raul Nunes Carvalho; Costa, Fabio Luiz Paranhos; Filho, Tarciso Silva de Andrade; Neto, Antonio Maia Jesus Chaves",J Nanosci Nanotechnol,,696

247792,Obese patients with NASH have increased hepatic expression of SARS-CoV-2 critical entry points,2020,"PURPOSE: A case of diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (DAH) occurring as a reaction to ustekinumab therapy is reported. SUMMARY: After starting ustekinumab for treatment of psoriatric arthritis, a 46-year-old female presented with flu-like symptoms and cough with blood-tinged sputum that had begun 1 week previously. Her initial computed tomography scan of the chest demonstrated bilateral ground-glass opacities. On bronchoscopy, the bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) return became bloodier from sample 1 to samples 2 and 3. Her BAL fluid was more than 90% hemosiderin-laden macrophages, a finding consistent with DAH. We ruled out infectious etiologies and other common vasculitis conditions that can cause DAH. A diagnosis of ustekinumab-induced DAH was made due to a temporal relationship between initiation of the drug and the patient's presentation and the absence of infection and other alternate diagnosis. Prior case reports including ustekinumab-induced pneumonitis, interstitial lung disease with a granulomatous component, and lupus syndrome have been reported, with this being the first case of DAH in a patient undergoing treatment of psoriatic arthritis. CONCLUSION: A 46-year-old woman developed DAH during ustekinumab treatment. Symptoms abated after drug discontinuation and supportive treament. Clinicians must remain mindful of this rare complication of ustekinumab use in order to avoid potential delays in appropriate DAH treatment.","Gunasekaran, Kulothungan; Shukla, Anant; Palanisamy, Nageshwari; Singh Rahi, Mandeep; Wolff, Armand",Am J Health Syst Pharm,,696

250455,Mouse Antibodies with Activity Against the SARS-CoV-2 D614G and B.1.351 Variants,2021,"OBJECTIVE: To assess the processes and outcomes of 2021 colon and rectal surgery match season: one of the first National Resident Matching Program (NRMP) match to conduct uniformly virtual interviews for all programs and candidates due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Since this if the first-year interviews were held entirely virtual for a (NRMP) match season, we sought to determine: (1) How did program directors (PDs) in this year's fellowship conduct their virtual interviews? (2) Were any of these conduct decisions associated with the PD satisfaction with the resulting match? (3) What is the PDs opinion of how interviews should occur next year if COVID-19 is not a factor? DESIGN AND SETTING: The authors sent an anonymous survey to the PDs of all programs participating in the 2021 colon and rectal surgery residency match directly following match day 2020. PARTICIPANTS: Forty-one colon and rectal residency PDs (70% response rate) responded to the survey (78% Male) representing a range of experience (Mâ¯=â¯7.61, SDâ¯=â¯5.66, years as PD at current institution), and program type (77.5% Academic, 7.5% Independent Academic Medical Center, 15% Nonacademic). RESULTS: While programs utilized several different platforms, conducted various forms of training for their faculty, and provided applicants with different types of information, interview day(s) across the specialty are reported to have proceeded smoothly. PDs as a whole were very satisfied with their match results this year (Mâ¯=â¯4.65, SDâ¯=â¯.66), and this satisfaction was not impacted by virtual interview decisions or processes. However, only 55% of PDs agree or strongly agree that next year's interviews should be virtual regardless of COVID-19, a judgement solely influenced by the opinion of other program faculty on virtual interviews, regardless of satisfaction with match or comfort with technology. CONCLUSION: While PDs report high satisfaction with virtual interview processes and outcomes, there is less agreement that colon and rectal surgery residency interviews should move to a solely virtual platform.","D039,; Angelo, Jonathan D; Angelo, Anne-Lise D; Mathis, Kellie L; Dozois, Eric J; Kelley, Scott R",J. surg. educ,,696

One of its most frequent occasions is the diagnosis of malignancy. Responding to the recipients' emotions is a critical issue in the delivery of unsettling information, and has an impact on the patient's trust in the treating physician, adjustment to illness and ultimately treatment. Since the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a pandemic on March 11, 2020, several measures of social distancing and isolation have been introduced to our clinical setting. In the wake of these restrictions, it is important to reexamine existing communication guidelines to determine their applicability to face-to-face counseling in the context of social distancing, as well as to new communication technologies, such as telemedicine.

251140,Potent SARS-CoV-2 binding and neutralization through maturation of iconic SARS-CoV-1 antibodies,2021,"Background: Valle del Cauca is the region with the fourth-highest number of COVID-19 cases in Colombia (>50,000 on September 7, 2020). Due to the lack of anti-COVID-19 therapies, decision-makers require timely and accurate data to estimate the incidence of disease and the availability of hospital resources to contain the pandemic. Methods: We adapted an existing model to the local context to forecast COVID-19 incidence and hospital resource use assuming different scenarios: (1) the implementation of quarantine from September 1st to October 15th (average daily growth rate of 2%); (2-3) partial restrictions (at 4% and 8% growth rates); and (4) no restrictions, assuming a 10% growth rate. Previous scenarios with predictions from June to August were also presented. We estimated the number of new cases, diagnostic tests required, and the number of available hospital and intensive care unit (ICU) beds (with and without ventilators) for each scenario. Results: We estimated 67,700 cases by October 15th when assuming the implementation of a quarantine, 80,400 and 101,500 cases when assuming partial restrictions at 4% and 8% infection rates, respectively, and 208,500 with no restrictions. According to different scenarios, the estimated demand for reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction tests ranged from 202,000 to 1,610,600 between September 1st and October 15th. The model predicted depletion of hospital and ICU beds by September 20th if all restrictions were to be lifted and the infection growth rate increased to 10%. Conclusion: Slowly lifting social distancing restrictions and reopening the economy is not expected to result in full resource depletion by October if the daily growth rate is maintained below 8%. Increasing the number of available beds provides a safeguard against slightly higher infection rates. Predictive models can be iteratively used to obtain nuanced predictions to aid decision-making.","Iragorri, Nicolas; Gómez-Restrepo, Carlos; Barrett, Kali; Herrera, Socrates; Hurtado, Isabel; Khan, Yasin; Mac, Stephen; Naimark, David; Pechlivanoglou, Petros; Rosselli, Diego; Toro, Dilian; Villamizar, Pedro; Ximenes, Raphael; Zapata, Helmer; Sander, Beate",Colomb Med (Cali),,696

Serum IgG4 levels are typically elevated but half of the patients had normal serum IgG4 levels. IgG4-RD represents a spectrum of diseases that involve various organs such as the pancreas, liver, kidneys, and salivary glands often manifesting as diffuse organ enlargement or a mass-like lesion mimicking cancer. An increased incidence of malignancy among patients with IgG4-RD has been reported. Thus, differentiating malignancy from IgG4-RD manifestation is important as the treatment differs. Glucocorticoids are considered first-line therapy and should be started early to prevent fibrosis. Patients usually have an excellent clinical response to steroids, and poor steroid response is indicative of an alternative diagnoses such as malignancy. This case report describes a case of IgG4-RD with renal mass in a young man that resolved with glucocorticoid therapy alone.","Ng, Shu Hui; Tay, Jing Shin; Lai, Ee Ling",BMJ case reports,,696

Recent data suggest that inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients do not have an increased risk of the development of COVID-19 complications. However, the impact of COVID-19 on IBD patients living in least developed areas remains to be fully elucidated. This study aims to describe the outcomes of IBD patients diagnosed with COVID-19 in countries from Latin America based on data from the SECURE-IBD registry. METHODS: Patients from Latin America enrolled in the SECURE-IBD registry were included. Descriptive analyses were used to summarize clinical and sociodemographic characteristics. The studied outcomes were (i) a composite of need for intensive care unit admission, ventilator use, and/or death (primary outcome) and (ii) a composite of any hospitalization and/or death (secondary outcome). Multivariable regression was used to identify risk factors of severe COVID-19. RESULTS: During the study period, 230 cases (Crohn's disease: n = 115, ulcerative colitis: n = 114, IBD-unclassified [IBD-U]: n = 1) were reported to the SECURE-IBD database from 13 different countries.

A heat procedure has been suggested for specimen inactivation. This study was designed to evaluate the effect of serum heating on biochemical indexes, and providing a basis for accurate detection results of the COVID-19 patients. METHODS: We collected 29 normal cases of two tubes of 5 mL whole blood. One tube was analyzed directly, and the other was analyzed after heating at 56°C 30 minutes. RESULTS: A total of 34 serum biochemical index quantitative results were obtained, 28/34 indexes were not significantly affected by the heat inactivation and remained clinically interpretable. As the thermal inactivation for these indexes showed good correlation, ALB (p = 0.04, Pearson R = 0.91, 2.6% mean increase), CysC (p = 0.03, Pearson R = 0.98, 9.9% mean increase), CO2CP (p < 0.001, Pearson R = 0.96, 13% mean decrease), they were still inter-pretable. Four biochemical indexes ALP, CK, CK-MB, and insulin were inactivated and showed significant statistical differences (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Our study showed CK, CK-MB, ALP, and insulin were sensitive to heat and will be inhibited or degrade after heating, indicating that the rapid decrease of this indexes in the COVID-19 patients may be caused by sample heat inactivation. For safety and diagnostic accuracy, we recommend the use of a point-of-care device for blood gases, electrolytes, troponin, and liver and renal function tests within a ISL 2 or above biosafety cabinet with level 3 or above biosafety laboratory practice.","Zhao, Jia; Li, Fei; Yuan, Bo; Li, Weixin; Gao, Jian; Hu, Xiaopeng; An, Yawen; Liu, Zhiyong; Li, Zhiwen; Liu, Hanqing; Song, Shuo; Wang, Jianchun",Clin. lab,,696

272701,SARS-CoV-2 rapidly adapts in aged BALB/c mice and induces typical pneumonia,2021,"Living lab outdoor experimentation using pervasive computing provides new opportunities: higher realism, external validity and socio-spatio-temporal observations in large scale. However, experimentation `in the wild' is complex and costly. Noise, biases, privacy concerns, compliance with standards of ethical review boards, remote moderation, control of experimental conditions and equipment perplex the collection of high-quality data for causal inference. This article introduces Smart Agora, a novel open-source software platform for rigorous systematic outdoor experimentation. Without writing a single line of code, highly complex experimental scenarios are visually designed and automatically deployed to smart phones. Novel geolocated survey and sensor data are collected subject of participants verifying desired experimental conditions, for instance, their localization at certain urban spots. This new approach drastically improves the quality and purposefulness of crowd sensing, tailored to conditions that confirm/reject hypotheses. The features that support this innovative functionality and the broad spectrum of its applicability are demonstrated.","Pournaras, Evangelos; Ghulam, Atif Nabi; Kunz, Renato; Hanggli, Regula",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2107.04117v3.pdf,696

There are no financial limitations to access to treatment in most countries. Patients in these countries have access to at least one pangenotypic regimen. The most common barriers to the elimination of HCV in Central Europe are a lack of established national screening programmes and limited political commitment to the elimination of HCV. Covid-19 has significantly affected the number of patients who have been diagnosed and treated, thus, delaying the potential elimination of HCV. These data suggest that the elimination of HCV elimination projected by WHO before 2030 will not be possible in the Central Europe.","Flisiak, Robert; Zarebska-Michaluk, Dorota; Frankova, Sona; Grgurevic, Ivica; Hunyady, Bela; Jarcuska, Peter; Kupcinskas, Limas; Makara, Michael; Simonova, Marieta; Sperl, Jan; Tolmane, Ieva; Vince, Adriana",Liver Int,,696

275575,Emergence of a Novel SARS-CoV-2 Variant in Southern California,2021,"The addition of hydrogen to anaerobic digesters is an emerging technique for the sustainable upgrading of biogas to biomethane with renewable electricity. However, it is critically dependent on the effective gas-liquid transfer of hydrogen, which is a sparingly soluble gas. Very little is known about the impact of liquid and gas flow and bubble size on gas-liquid transfer during H2 injection in full-scale anaerobic digesters. A computational fluid dynamic model was developed using a two-fluid approach for non-Newtonian liquid in the open-source computational fluid dynamics (CFD) platform, OpenFOAM. The newly developed model was validated against published experimental data-sets of a gas-mixed, laboratory-scale anaerobic digester, with good agreement between the numerical and experimental velocity fields. The hydrodynamics of the full-scale in-situ biomethanation system using venturi ejectors for H2 injection was then simulated to investigate gas-liquid dynamics, including gas-liquid mass transfer, at different operational conditions. Gas-liquid mixing is mainly controlled by the gas-plumes interaction, which promotes turbulence at the interaction zone, resulting in increasing gas bubbles mixing with the liquid and the gas-liquid interfacial area. However, beyond the plume interaction zone, the digester had flow short-circuiting and inactive zones. It was found that, due to this short-circuiting behaviour, an increase in gas flow-rate may not be an effective option in reducing inactive zones, although it can increase the gas-liquid interfacial area. Comparative analysis of the impact of gas flow and bubble size indicated that gas flow had a linear effect on both kLa and gas holdup, but that bubble size had a non-linear impact, with higher kLa values achieved at bubble sizes less than 2 mm. Comparison against measured data in the same system indicated the predicted kLa values were at the same level as measured kLa, at a bubble size of 2 mm.","Ahmmed, Mohammad Shakil; Jensen, Mads Borgbjerg; Kofoed, Michael V W; Ottosen, Lars D M; Batstone, Damien J",Water Res,,696

Such high-throughput repurposing screens have already identified several existing drugs with potential to combat SARS-CoV-2. However, moving these hits forward for possible development into drugs specifically against this pathogen requires unambiguous identification of their corresponding targets, something the high-throughput screens are not typically designed to reveal. We present here a new computational inverse-docking protocol that uses all-atom protein structures and a combination of docking methods to rank-order targets for each of several existing drugs for which a plurality of recent high-throughput screens detected anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity. We demonstrate validation of this method with known drug-target pairs. We subjected 152 distinct drugs potentially suitable for repurposing to the inverse docking procedure. Detailed structural analysis revealed important insights and could potentially lead to more rational design of new drugs against these targets.","Sergio, P. Ribone Paz S. Alexis Cameron F.

It is based on cross-sectional survey data (n = 1508), representing the population >14 years living in Germany. Data collection took place in October 2020, using computer-assisted web interviewing. Results show that overall, 23% of respondents used digital media for sports activities at least one time during the COVID-19 pandemic. Numbers increased during the lockdown and decreased afterwards. People engaged in a variety of fitness workouts, most frequently practiced with the help of publicly accessible fitness videos from video-sharing platforms. Digital sports practitioners are younger, better educated, and financially better off. Females are overrepresented. Individuals engaged in digital sports achieved 30 min/week more sports activity during the pandemic compared to individuals solely involved in offline sports. Hence, home-based digital sports activities were a popular means to stay active, particularly in the period of the lockdown. Strong social disparities indicate that the possible health benefits of digital sports only reach out to particular population groups.","Mutz, Michael; Müller, Johannes; Reimers, Anne K",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,696

When POC TTE is performed by the hepatologist or intensivist in the intensive care unit (ICU), and interpreted remotely by a cardiologist, it can rule out cardiovascular conditions that may be contributing to undifferentiated shock, such as diastolic dysfunction, myocardial infarction, myocarditis, regional wall motion abnormalities and pulmonary embolism. The COVID-19 pandemic has led to a delay in seeking medical treatment, reduced invasive interventions and deferment in referrals leading to ""collateral damage"" in critically ill patients with liver disease. Thus, the use of telemedicine in the ICU (Tele-ICU) has integrated cardiology, intensive care, and hepatology practices across the spectrum of ICU, operating room, and transplant healthcare. Telecardiology tools have improved bedside diagnosis when introduced as part of COVID-19 care by remote supervision and interpretation of POCUS and echocardiographic data. In this review, we present the contemporary approach of using POC echocardiography and offer a practical guide for primary care hepatologists and gastroenterologists for cardiac assessment in critically ill patients with cirrhosis and ACLF.

Some allergic diseases, including asthma, have been defined as risk factors for a poor outcome in COVID-19. We aimed to investigate the role of another allergic disease-allergic rhinitis-in the severity of COVID-19. METHODS: This case-control study was conducted at Sakarya Educational and Research Hospital, Toyota Hospital and Yenikent State Hospital between March 18, 2020 and August 30, 2020. The study included a case group of 125 randomly selected patients who had been diagnosed with allergic rhinitis in advance of having COVID-19 and a control group of 125 patients without allergic rhinitis who were diagnosed with COVID-19. We evaluated all participants' statuses regarding smoking, symptoms, and hospitalization, as well as the length of their hospitalization and the number of their comorbidities. RESULTS: There were no statistically significant differences between the two groups regarding percentage of asymptomatic patients (p = 0.27), presence of smoking (p = 0.068), hospitalization status (p = 0.79), and hospitalization length (p = 0.55). From each group, two patients needed care in an intensive care unit (ICU). One patient from the case group and two from the control group died due to COVID-19.

A survey was conducted among the medical practitioners from India and Bangladesh to find out the possibility of anxiety as after-effect of COVID-19 through questionnaires. Results of the study showed that 95% medical practitioners were in the view to have chances of anxiety with more possibility to have social anxiety and post-traumatic stress anxiety disorder as a consequence of COVID-19. Female and male genders have equal chances, whereas transgender have lesser chances to have anxiety disorders as a consequence of COVID-19. Population above 50 years age might have maximum chance of having anxiety as after-effect of COVID-19. The study concludes to have chances of anxiety as repercussion of COVID-19.","Kumar, Dinesh; Bajaj, Goma; Bhoria, Anupama; Banerjee, Sudipta; Yadav, Pawan; Kumar, Sunil; Kumar, Davinder; Singh, Randhir; Madaan, Sunil Kumar; Singh, Jitender",Arab J Sci Eng,,696
290854,A parsimonious approach for recognizing SARS-CoV-2 and host interactions,2021,"Unions and worker cooperatives have long represented distinct approaches to building worker voice. This paper draws from observations of the work of the “Co-op Exploratory Committee” of 1199SEIU, the nation’s largest union local, which is seeking to expand the development of unionized worker cooperatives. Described by Martin Luther King, Jr, as his “favorite” union, 1199SEIU has a storied history of organizing frontline healthcare workers and includes large numbers of women of color and immigrant workers among its membership. Since 2003, it has also represented workers at Cooperative Home Care Associates, the nation’s largest worker cooperative. Drawing from discussions among union officials, co-op leaders, and rank-and-file union members about the potential role of unionized worker cooperatives within the labor movement, the paper examines the creative tension between stakeholder and democratic logics in efforts to expand this model. It argues that continued union decline, heightened interest in economic alternatives, and systemic frailties exposed by Covid-19 may create new opportunities for building unionized worker co-ops at scale. © 2021 by Emerald Publishing Limited","Pinto, S.",Research in the Sociology of Organizations,,696

293112,SARS-CoV-2 leads to a small vessel endotheliitis in the heart,2021,"BACKGROUND: Cognitive Adaptation Training is a psychosocial intervention that focuses on reducing the negative effects of cognitive disorders, especially executive functions such as planning and targeted action. International research has shown that Cognitive Adaptation Training enhances multiple aspects of daily functioning in people with severe mental illnesses. Despite this evidence, implementation of the intervention into routine care remains a challenge. OBJECTIVE: In this implementation research, a newly developed implementation program based on previous experience and scientific literature, is tested. The primary aim of this research is to assess the effectiveness of the implementation program. The secondary aim of this study is to evaluate the factors that impede or facilitate the implementation of Cognitive Adaptation Training. METHODS: To test the effectiveness of the implementation program, a multicenter cluster randomized controlled trial was conducted comparing the implementation program to a single training program in four mental health institutions in The Netherlands. Focus groups, semistructured interviews, and questionnaires were used at multiple levels of service delivery (service user, professional, team, organization) to identify factors that may hamper or facilitate implementation. The RE-AIM framework was applied to measure the implementation effectiveness. Following this framework, the primary outcomes were Reach, Intervention Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, and Maintenance. These are assessed before, during, and after implementation. The research had a total duration of 14 months, with a follow-up measurement at 14 months. Data will be analyzed using multilevel modeling. RESULTS: The study was funded in April 2018. Data collection occurred between November 2018 and January 2020. In total, 21 teams of 4 mental health institutions agreed to participate. Data analysis is ongoing and results are expected to be published in December 2020. CONCLUSIONS: This implementation research may provide important information about the implementation of psychosocial interventions in practice and may result in a program that is useful for Cognitive Adaptation Training, and possibly for psychosocial interventions in general.

However, understanding the perceptions of using an e-proctoring tool within the online examination experience is still limited. This study explores the first unique experience for students' attitudes and concerns using an e-proctoring tool in their final exams during the COVID-19 pandemic. It also highlights the e-tools' impact on students' performances to guide educational institutions towards appropriate practices going forward, especially as the pandemic is expected to have far-reaching consequences. A mixed-methods analysis was used to examine heterogeneous sources of data including self-reported data and officially documented data. The data was analyzed by a qualitative analysis of the focus group and quantitative analyses of the survey questions and exam attempts. In June 2020, students participated in a focus group to elaborate on their attitudes and concerns pertaining to their e-proctoring experience. Based on the preliminary outcomes, a survey was developed and distributed to a purposive sample (n = 106) of students from information technology majors who had taken at least one e-proctored exam during the COVID-19 pandemic. Finally, 21 online exams with 815 total attempts were analyzed to assess how well students performed under an e-proctored test. The study's findings shed light on students' perceptions of their e-proctoring experience, including their predominant concerns over privacy and various environmental and psychological factors. The research also highlights challenges in implementing the e-proctoring tool as well as its impact on students' performance.","Kharbat, Faten F; Abu Daabes, Ajayeb S",Educ Inf Technol (Dordr),,696

299192,"Genome Profiling of SARS-CoV-2 in Indonesia, ASEAN and the Neighbouring East Asian Countries: Features, Challenges and Achievements",2021,"Even before the COVID-19 pandemic, there was growing interest in designing healthier neighbourhoods. Adopting this perspective brings attention to how conditions in neighbourhoods (directly and indirectly) affect their inhabitants’ physical health and mental wellbeing. However, considerably less attention has been paid to how to alleviate such conditions through integrated interventions designed to operate specifically at the neighbourhood scale. To address this gap, this paper introduces the term “unhealthy neighbourhood syndrome” (UNS). The conceptual clar-ity and practical utility offered by using this term are critically examined. The paper contains a rigorous review and critical analysis of academic and grey literature on what are held to be the relationships between key features of the built environment and people’s health and wellbeing. It also examines literature offering advice on how urban designers should make neighbourhoods healthier. It illustrates the complexity of the range of issues involved and the complicated web of top down, bottom up and middling out actors that need to be involved in making decisions about them. Despite having inherent weaknesses, the term “unhealthy neighbourhood syndrome” is judged to be useful. It illustrates how seemingly separate issues operate in urban design, promoted for tackling specific symptoms of ill health, need to be addressed jointly through an integrated programme of parallel work streams operating at the neighbourhood scale. The paper is innovative in identifying the wide cluster of symptoms used to describe unhealthy neighbourhoods in the literature as being a “syndrome”. Its significance lies in its injunction that this syndrome needs to be tackled through integrated streams of remedial action drawing on experience and expertise that lie beyond those offered by the traditional membership of urban design teams. © 2021 by the authors.

300681,The implementation of a rapid sample preparation method for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 in a diagnostic laboratory in South Africa,2020,"OBJECTIVES: In South Korea, 13 745 cases of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) had been reported as of 19 July, 2020. To examine spatiotemporal changes in the transmission potential, we aimed to present regional estimates of the doubling time and reproduction number (Rt) for COVID-19 in the country. METHODS: Daily series of confirmed COVID-19 cases in the most affected regions were extracted from publicly available sources. We employed established mathematical and statistical methods to investigate the time-varying reproduction numbers and doubling time for COVID-19 in Korea. RESULTS: At the regional level, Seoul and Gyeonggi Province experienced the first peak of COVID-19 in early March, followed by a second wave in early June, withRt exceeding 3.0 and mean doubling time ranging from 3.6 to 10.1 days. As of 19 July, 2020, Gyeongbuk Province and Daegu had yet to experience a second wave of the disease. During the first wave, mean Rt for these areas reached 3.5-4.4, and doubling time ranged from 2.8 to 4.6 days. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings support the effectiveness of control measures against COVID-19 in Korea. However, the easing of restrictions that had been imposed by the government in May 2020 facilitated a second wave in the greater Seoul area.","Shim, Eunha; Tariq, Amna; Chowell, Gerardo",Int J Infect Dis,,696
301931,Reduced Self-Awareness Following a Combined Polar and Paramedian Bilateral Thalamic Infarction. A Possible Relationship With SARS-CoV-2 Risk of Contagion?,2020,"The viral lineages reflecting variants of concern have emerged worldwide and among them B.1.1.7 (Alpha), B.1351 (Beta) and B.1.617.2 (Delta) variants are the most significant ones and merit close monitoring. In Pakistan, very limited information is available on the circulation of these variants and only the alpha variant has been reported as the main circulating lineage. The objective of this study was to detect and explore the genomic diversity of B.1.351 and B.1.617.2 during the third wave in the indigenous population. During the current study, a total of 2274 samples were tested on real-time PCR for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 from May 14 to May 31, 2021, and among these, 17% were spike positive, whereas 83% of samples had the spike gene target failure (SGTF). From these spike positive samples, 22 samples were processed for whole-genome sequencing. Among VOCs, 45.5% (n=10) belonged to B.1.351 followed by B.1.617.2, 36% (n=8). The delta variant cases were reported mostly from Islamabad (n = 5; 63%) followed by Peshawar and Azad Kashmir (n = 1; 13% each). Beta variant cases originated from Islamabad (n=5; 56%), Peshawar (n=2; 22%), Azad Kashmir and Rawalpindi (n=1; 11% each). The mutation profile of delta variant isolates reported significant mutations, L452R, T478K, P681R, and D950N. The beta variant isolates reported characteristic mutations, D215G, K417N, E484K, N501Y, and A701V. Notably, a characteristic mutation, E484Q was also found in delta variant, B.1.617.2. Our current findings suggest detection of these VOCs from the local population and warrants large-scale genomic surveillance in the country. In addition, it provides timely information to the health authorities to take appropriate actions.","Umair, Massab; Ikram, Aamer; Salman, Muhammad; Badar, Nazish; Haider, Syed Adnan; Rehman, Zaira; Ammar, Muhammad; Rana, Muhammad Suleman; Ali, Qasim",,,696

304809,Is the First of the Two Born Saved? A Rare and Dramatic Case of Double Placental Damage from SARS-CoV-2,2021,"OBJECTIVES: To assess the association of public interest in coronavirus infections with the actual number of infected cases for selected countries across the globe. METHODS: We performed a Google TrendsTM search for ""Coronavirus"" and compared Relative Search Volumes (RSV) indices to the number of reported COVID-19 cases by the European Center for Disease Control (ECDC) using time-lag correlation analysis. RESULTS: Worldwide public interest in Coronavirus reached its first peak end of January when numbers of newly infected patients started to increase exponentially in China. The worldwide Google TrendsTM index reached its peak on the 12th of March 2020 at a time when numbers of infected patients started to increase in Europe and COVID-19 was declared a pandemic. At this time the general interest in China but also the Republic of Korea has already been significantly decreased as compared to end of January. Correlations between RSV indices and number of new COVID-19 cases were observed across all investigated countries with highest correlations observed with a time lag of -11.5 days, i.e. highest interest in coronavirus observed 11.5 days before the peak of newly infected cases. This pattern was very consistent across European countries but also holds true for the US. In Brazil and Australia, highest correlations were observed with a time lag of -7 days. In Egypt the highest correlation is given with a time lag of 0, potentially indicating that in this country, numbers of newly infected patients will increase exponentially within the course of April. CONCLUSIONS: Public interest indicated by RSV indices can help to monitor the progression of an outbreak such as the current COVID-19 pandemic. Public interest is on average highest 11.5 days before the peak of newly infected cases.","Effenberger, Maria; Kronbichler, Andreas; Shin, Jae Il; Mayer, Gert; Tilg, Herbert; Perco, Paul",Int J Infect Dis,,696

We systematically reviewed the clinical outcomes of using antiretroviral drugs for the prevention and treatment of coronaviruses and planned clinical trials. METHODS: Three databases were screened from inception to 30 March 2020 for studies reporting clinical outcomes of patients with SARS, MERS or COVID-19 treated with antiretrovirals. RESULTS: From an initial screen of 433 titles, two randomized trials and 24 observational studies provided clinical outcome data on the use of antiretroviral drugs; most studies reported outcomes using LPV/r as treatment. Of the 21 observational studies reporting treatment outcomes, there were three studies among patients with SARS, six studies among patients with MERS and 12 studies among patients with COVID-19. In one randomized trial 99 patients with severe COVID-19 illness were randomized to receive LPV/r (400/100 mg twice a day) and 100 patients to standard of care for 14 days: LPV/r was not associated with a statistically significant difference in time to clinical improvement, although LPV/r given within 12 days of symptoms was associated with shorter time to clinical improvement; 28 day mortality was numerically lower in the LPV/r group (14/99) compared to the control group (25/100), but this difference was not statistically significant.

307368,Calling for pan-European commitment for rapid and sustained reduction in SARS-CoV-2 infections,2021,"We report on using the synthetic aminoadamantane-CH2-aryl derivatives 1-6 as sensitive probes for blocking M2 S31N and influenza A virus (IAV) M2 wild-type (WT) channels as well as virus replication in cell culture. The binding kinetics measured using electrophysiology (EP) for M2 S31N channel are very dependent on the length between the adamantane moiety and the first ring of the aryl headgroup realized in 2 and 3 and the girth and length of the adamantane adduct realized in 4 and 5. Study of 1-6 shows that, according to molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and molecular mechanics Poisson-Boltzmann surface area (MM/PBSA) calculations, all bind in the M2 S31N channel with the adamantyl group positioned between V27 and G34 and the aryl group projecting out of the channel with the phenyl (or isoxazole in 6) embedded in the V27 cluster. In this outward binding configuration, an elongation of the ligand by only one methylene in rimantadine 2 or using diamantane or triamantane instead of adamantane in 4 and 5, respectively, causes incomplete entry and facilitates exit, abolishing effective block compared to the amantadine derivatives 1 and 6. In the active M2 S31N blockers 1 and 6, the phenyl and isoxazolyl head groups achieve a deeper binding position and high kon/low koff and high kon/high koff rate constants, compared to inactive 2-5, which have much lower kon and higher koff. Compounds 1-5 block the M2 WT channel by binding in the longer area from V27-H37, in the inward orientation, with high kon and low koff rate constants. Infection of cell cultures by influenza virus containing M2 WT or M2 S31N is inhibited by 1-5 or 1-4 and 6, respectively. While 1 and 6 block infection through the M2 block mechanism in the S31N variant, 2-4 may block M2 S31N virus replication in cell culture through the lysosomotropic effect, just as chloroquine is thought to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Tzitzoglaki, Christina; McGuire, Kelly; Lagarias, Panagiotis; Konstantinidi, Athina; Hoffmann, Anja; Fokina, Natalie A; Ma, Chulong; Papanastasiou, Ioannis P; Schreiner, Peter R; Vázquez, Santiago; Schmidtke, Michaela; Wang, Jun; Busath, David D; Kolocouris, Antonios",ACS Chem Biol,,696

Lateral flow immune-antibody test was positive for 7.2% in June and 5.9% in September, with 3.9% positive in both. Being more symptomatic or suspecting infection increased the probability of ever being positive. Of those positive in June, 46% (49/107) were negative in September (seroreversion), and this was similar regardless of symptom characteristics, suspicion, and timing of possible infection. A possible outlier was those aged over 55 years, where only 3 of 13 (23%) had seroreversion. DiscussionThese results do not follow the pattern reported from studies specifically designed to monitor seropositivity, which have found greater consistency over time and the influence of presence, timing and severity of symptoms on seroreversion. We suggest several factors that may have contributed to this difference: our low bar in defining initial seropositivity (single test); a non-quantitative test known to have relatively low sensitivity; participants carrying out testing. We would encourage other studies to use these real-world performance characteristics alongside those from laboratory studies to plan and analyse any antibody testing.","Davis, Katrina A S; Oetzmann, Carolin; Carr, Ewan; Malim, Michael; Boshell, Vanessa J; Lavelle, Grace; Leightley, Daniel J; Polling, Catherine; Stevelink, Sharon; Vitiello, Valentina; Wickersham, Alice; Razavi, Reza; Hotopf, Matthew H; team, - KCL-CHECK",,,696

The current study sought to measure the perceived impact of COVID-19 and the resulting stay-at-home orders in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and Buffalo, New York on smokers enrolled in four smoking cessation trials between March 2020 and July 2020. The survey collected quantitative data regarding life changes due to COVID-19, health/exposure status, and the impact on their cessation attempt (e.g., motivation to quit, change in triggers). The questionnaire collected qualitative data to better understand how such changes could explain changes in smoking behavior. Of the 42 participants surveyed, approximately half indicated that COVID-19 changed their motivation and ability to quit or remain quit. Among those who reported that it was easier to quit following the stay-at-home orders (n = 24), most attributed this to concerns regarding the severity of COVID-19 among smokers. Among those who reported more difficulty quitting (n = 15), most attributed this to their increased stress due to the pandemic and the inability to access activities, places, or people that could help them manage triggers. Given public health warnings of continued surges in COVID-19, these data provide insight into who may benefit from further smoking cessation support should existing restrictions or new stay-at-home orders be enacted.","Rosoff-Verbit, Zoe; Logue-Chamberlain, Erin; Fishman, Jessica; Audrain-McGovern, Janet; Hawk, Larry; Mahoney, Martin; Mazur, Alexa; Ashare, Rebecca",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,696

312524,SARS-CoV-2 Diagnostic - What is Really Sensible?,2021,"This study presents a first assessment of the Top-Of-Atmosphere (TOA) radiances measured in the visible and near-infrared (VNIR) wavelengths from PRISMA (PRecursore IperSpettrale della Missione Applicativa), the new hyperspectral satellite sensor of the Italian Space Agency in orbit since March 2019. In particular, the radiometrically calibrated PRISMA Level 1 TOA radiances were compared to the TOA radiances simulated with a radiative transfer code, starting from in situ measurements of water reflectance. In situ data were obtained from a set of fixed position autonomous radiometers covering a wide range of water types, encompassing coastal and inland waters. A total of nine match-ups between PRISMA and in situ measurements distributed from July 2019 to June 2020 were analysed. Recognising the role of Sentinel-2 for inland and coastal waters applications, the TOA radiances measured from concurrent Sentinel-2 observations were added to the comparison. The results overall demonstrated that PRISMA VNIR sensor is providing TOA radiances with the same magnitude and shape of those in situ simulated (spectral angle difference, SA, between 0.80 and 3.39; root mean square difference, RMSD, between 0.98 and 4.76 [mW m-2 sr-1 nm-1]), with slightly larger differences at shorter wavelengths. The PRISMA TOA radiances were also found very similar to Sentinel-2 data (RMSD < 3.78 [mW m-2 sr-1 nm-1]), and encourage a synergic use of both sensors for aquatic applications. Further analyses with a higher number of match-ups between PRISMA, in situ and Sentinel-2 data are however recommended to fully characterize the on-orbit calibration of PRISMA for its exploitation in aquatic ecosystem mapping.","Giardino, Claudia; Bresciani, Mariano; Braga, Federica; Fabbretto, Alice; Ghirardi, Nicola; Pepe, Monica; Gianinetto, Marco; Colombo, Roberto; Cogliati, Sergio; Ghebrehiwot, Semhar; Laanen, Marnix; Peters, Steef; Schroeder, Thomas; Concha, Javier A; Brando, Vittorio E",,,696

314054,How the US Failed to Prioritize SARS-CoV-2 Variant Surveillance,2021,"The development of an effective AIDS vaccine remains a challenge. Nucleoside-modified mRNAs formulated in lipid nanoparticles (mRNA-LNP) have proved to be a potent mode of immunization against infectious diseases in preclinical studies, and are being tested for SARS-CoV-2 in humans. A critical question is how mRNA-LNP vaccine immunogenicity compares to that of traditional adjuvanted protein vaccines in primates. Here, we show that mRNA-LNP immunization compared to protein immunization elicits either the same or superior magnitude and breadth of HIV-1 Env-specific polyfunctional antibodies. Immunization with mRNA-LNP encoding Zika premembrane and envelope or HIV-1 Env gp160 induces durable neutralizing antibodies for at least 41 weeks. Doses of mRNA-LNP as low as 5 µg are immunogenic in macaques. Thus, mRNA-LNP can be used to rapidly generate single or multi-component vaccines, such as sequential vaccines needed to protect against HIV-1 infection. Such vaccines would be as or more immunogenic than adjuvanted recombinant protein vaccines in primates.","Saunders, Kevin O; Pardi, Norbert; Parks, Robert; Santra, Sampa; Mu, Zekun; Sutherland, Laura; Scearce, Richard; Barr, Maggie; Eaton, Amanda; Hernandez, Giovanna; Goodman, Derrick; Hogan, Michael J; Tombacz, Istvan; Gordon, David N; Rountree, R Wes; Wang, Yunfei; Lewis, Mark G; Pierson, Theodore C; Barbosa, Chris; Tam, Ying; Shen, Xiaoying; Ferrari, Guido; Tomaras, Georgia D; Montefiori, David C; Weissman, Drew; Haynes, Barton F",NPJ Vaccines,,696
314138,SARS-CoV-2: seroepidemiological pattern in northeastern Bulgaria,2020,"In January of this year (2020), a major scientific study ('the Minshull report') announced that gas hydrate reservoirs were found in many offshore areas across Europe. The European Commission is now considering a policy view to commercialize the development and extraction of methane gas from European offshore areas. Affirmation from the European Commission that offshore methane hydrates are too useful and too valuable to forego development could initiate a global response to adopt offshore methane hydrates as a new source of natural gas for heating, for electrical power supplies, and for potential new revenues. The upside? The potential rewards from offshore methane hydrates are multi-fold. Coastal states are surrounded in methane hydrate resources that if responsibly developed could enable vast amounts of methane (natural gas) to be produced for decades or centuries beyond the timelines of conventional natural gas assets. There are also massive volumes of fresh water trapped in hydrates that could aid in fighting droughts and desertification. The downside? There are novel foreseeable risks that might result from those commercial methane hydrate activities. The climate change risks and geo-physical hazards from offshore methane hydrates are quite distinct from both conventional and unconventional hydrocarbons. There are new challenges to achieving safety and sustainability. In review, this paper both welcomes the discovery and confirmation of offshore methane hydrates in European waters and also raises concerns that more research is required on the optimal policy strategies for the known and foreseeable risks to best enable safe and sustainable policy choices.","Partain, Roy Andrew; Yiallourides, Constantinos",Mar Policy,,696

This prevention implies an effective system of epidemiological surveillance and the application of timely and effective control measures. This research focuses on the application of techniques for modelling and geovisualization of epidemic data with the aim of simple and fast communication of analytical results via geoportal. Methods The paper describes the approach applied through the project of establishing the epidemiological location-intelligence system for monitoring the effectiveness of control measures in preventing the spread of COVID-19 in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Results Epidemic data were processed and the results related to spatio-temporal analysis of the infection spread were presented by compartmental epidemic model, reproduction number R, epi-curve diagrams as well as choropleth maps for different levels of administrative units. Geovisualization of epidemic data enabled the release of numerous information from described models and indicators, providing easier visual communication of the spread of the disease and better recognition of its trend. Conclusion The approach involves the simultaneous application of epidemic models and epidemic data geovisualization, which allows a simple and rapid evaluation of the epidemic situation and the effects of control measures. This contributes to more informative decision-making related to control measures by suggesting their selective application at the local level.","Ponjavic, Mirza; Karabegovic, Almir; Ferhatbegovic, Elvir; Tahirovic, Emin; Uzunovic, Selma; Travar, Maja; Pilav, Aida; Mulic, Maida; Karakas, Sead; Avdic, Nermin; Mulabdic, Zarina; Pavic, Goran; Bico, Medina; Vasilj, Ivan; Mamic, Diana; Hukic, Mirsada",Med Glas (Zenica),,696

316021,SARS-CoV-2 interacts with platelets and megakaryocytes via ACE2-independent mechanism,2021,"Official counts of COVID-19 deaths have been criticized for potentially including people who did not die of COVID-19 but merely died with COVID-19. I address that critique by fitting a generalized additive model to weekly counts of all registered deaths in England and Wales during the 2010s. The model produces baseline rates of death registrations expected in the absence of the COVID-19 pandemic, and comparing those baselines to recent counts of registered deaths exposes the emergence of excess deaths late in March 2020. Among adults aged 45+, about 38,700 excess deaths were registered in the 5 weeks comprising 21 March through 24 April (612 $\pm$ 416 from 21$-$27 March, 5675 $\pm$ 439 from 28 March through 3 April, then 9183 $\pm$ 468, 12,712 $\pm$ 589, and 10,511 $\pm$ 567 in April's next 3 weeks). Both the Office for National Statistics's respective count of 26,891 death certificates which mention COVID-19, and the Department of Health and Social Care's hospital-focused count of 21,222 deaths, are appreciably less, implying that their counting methods have underestimated rather than overestimated the pandemic's true death toll. If underreporting rates have held steady, about 45,900 direct and indirect COVID-19 deaths might have been registered by April's end but not yet publicly reported in full.","Thomas, Drew M",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.11355v4.pdf,696

320098,An Extensive Meta-Metagenomic Search Identifies SARS-CoV-2-Homologous Sequences in Pangolin Lung Viromes,2020,"Resource support between individuals is of particular importance in controlling or mitigating epidemic spreading, especially during pandemics. Whereas there remains the question of how we can protect ourselves from being infected while helping others by donating resources in fighting against the epidemic. To answer the question, we propose a novel resource allocation model by considering the awareness of self-protection of individuals. In the model, a tuning parameter is introduced to quantify the reaction strength of individuals when they are aware of the disease. And then, a coupled model of resource allocation and disease spreading is proposed to study the impact of self-awareness on resource allocation and, its impact on the dynamics of epidemic spreading. Through theoretical analysis and extensive Monte Carlo simulations, we find that in the stationary state, the system converges to two states: the whole healthy or the completely infected, which indicates an abrupt increase in the prevalence when there is a shortage of resources. More importantly, we find that too cautious and too selfless for the people during the outbreak of an epidemic are both not suitable for disease control. Through extensive simulations, we find the optimal point, at which there is a maximum value of the epidemic threshold, and an outbreak can be delayed to the greatest extent. At last, we study further the effects of network structure on the coupled dynamics. We find that the degree heterogeneity promotes the outbreak of disease, and the network structure does not alter the optimal phenomenon in behavior response.","Chen, Xiaolong; Liu, Quanhui; Wang, Ruijie; Li, Qing; Wang, Wei",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2002.02607v1.pdf,696

On the other hand, the sense of coherence (SOC) is a competence that could help these professionals perceive the situation as understandable, manageable and meaningful. This study aims to analyse the extent to which potential risk and protective factors against burnout have affected nursing home workers during the COVID-19 pandemic and to assess the contribution of these factors to their burnout. Three hundred forty professionals who worked in nursing homes in Spain completed a survey and reported on their sociodemographic characteristics and their organisational characteristics of the job related to COVID-19, SOC and burnout. Multiple linear regression analyses were performed. The results showed that the SOC is highly related to the dimensions of burnout and is a protective factor against this. In addition, the increase in hours has a negative effect, facilitating inadequate responses to stressful situations; and whereas perceived social support and availability of resources have a protective effect, the deterioration in mental and physical health is the most important risk factor. This study could help better understand the psychological consequences of the effort that nursing home workers and can also help design mental health prevention and care interventions for workers that provide them with resources and supports that foster their coping skills.","Navarro Prados, Ana Belén; Jiménez García-Tizón, Sara; Meléndez, Juan Carlos",Heal. soc. care community,,696
323103,Nanobody-Functionalized Cellulose for Capturing and Containing SARS-CoV-2,2021,"INTRODUCTION: There is an urgent need for new animal models of SARS CoV-2 infection to improve research and drug development. This brief commentary examines the deficits of current models and proposes several improved alternates. The existing single transgene mouse models poorly mimic the clinical features of COVID-19; those strains get a milder disease than human COVID-19 disease. Many of the current transgenic models utilize random integration of several copies of single ACE2 transgenes, resulting in unnatural gene expression and exhibit rapid lethality. We suggest preparing precision knock-in of selected human mini genes at the mouse initiation codon and knock-out of the mouse homolog as a better option. Three genes critical for infection are suggested targets, ACE2 (the viral cellular receptor), its co-infection protease TMRPSS2, and the primary antibody clearance receptor FcÎ³RT. To offer the best platform for COVID 19 research, preparation of single, double, and triple humanized combinations offers the researcher the opportunity to better understand the contributions of these receptors, coreceptors to therapeutic efficacy. In addition, we propose to create the humanized strains in the C57BL/6J and BALB/c backgrounds. These two backgrounds are Th1 responders and Th2 responders, respectively, and allow modeling of the variability seen in human pathology including lung pathology and late sequelae of COVID-19 disease (BALB/c). We suggest the need to do a thorough characterization of both the short-term and long-term effects of SAR-CoV-2 infection at the clinical, virologic, histopathologic, hematologic, and immunologic levels. We expect the multiply humanized strains will be superior to the single-gene and multiple-gene-copy transgenic models available to date. These mouse models will represent state-of-the-art tools for investigating mechanisms of COVID-19 pathogenesis and immunity and developing vaccines and drugs.","Jarnagin, Kurt; Alvarez, Oscar; Shresta, Sujan; Webb, David R",Biochem Pharmacol,,696

The use of chemical sanitizers is often not suitable for these kinds of commodities;therefore, a non-thermal sanitation technology could help to increase safety in relation to the food supply chain. Cold plasma has proven to be a promising strategy for virus inactivation. This research is aimed at evaluating the ability of a cold plasma sanitation system to inactivate SARS-CoV-2 RNA on packaged foods. Two different plastic materials were investigated and subjected to 5- and 10-min exposure to plasma after experimental inoculum of the RNA. In addition to viral degradation, possible changes in the performance of the materials were evaluated. Shelf-life of the foods, after exposure of the packages to plasma, was also investigated. Results showed that 10 min of exposure was sufficient to almost completely eliminate the viral RNA from package surfaces. The treatment did not produce any significant variation in packaging material performance or the shelf-life of the tested packaged products, indicating the potentiality of this treatment for the decontamination of packaged products.","Capelli, Filippo Tappi Silvia Gritti Tommaso de Aguiar Saldanha Pinheiro Ana Cristina Laurita Romolo Tylewicz Urszula Spataro Francesco Braschi Giacomo Lanciotti Rosalba Gómez Galindo Federico Siracusa Valentina Romani Santina Gherardi Matteo Colombo Vittorio Sambri Vittorio Rocculi Pietro",Applied Sciences,,696

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the clinical features and outcomes of COVID-19 pneumonia in kidney transplant recipients. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A total of 10 renal transplant recipients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia were enrolled in this retrospective study. In addition, 10 of their family members diagnosed with COVID-19 pneumonia were included in the control group. INTERVENTION: Immunosuppressant reduction and low-dose methylprednisolone therapy. OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: The clinical outcomes (the severity of pneumonia, recovery rate, time of virus shedding, and length of illness) were compared with the control group by statistical analysis. RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: The clinical symptomatic, laboratory, and radiological characteristics of COVID-19 pneumonia in the renal transplant recipients were similar to those of severe COVID-19 pneumonia in the general population. The severity of COVID-19 pneumonia was greater in the transplant recipients than in the control group (five severe/three critical cases vs one severe case). Five patients developed transient renal allograft damage. After a longer time of virus shedding (28.4 ± 9.3 vs 12.2 ± 4.6 d in the control group) and a longer course of illness (35.3 ± 8.3 vs 18.8 ± 10.5 d in the control group), nine of the 10 transplant patients recovered successfully after treatment. One patient developed acute renal graft failure and died of progressive respiratory failure. CONCLUSIONS: Kidney transplant recipients had more severe COVID-19 pneumonia than the general population, but most of them recovered after a prolonged clinical course and virus shedding. Findings from this small group of cases may have important implications for the treatment of COVID-19 pneumonia in immunosuppressed populations. PATIENT SUMMARY: Immunosuppressed transplant recipients with coronavirus disease 2019 infection had more severe pneumonia, but most of them still achieved a good prognosis after appropriate treatment.","Zhu, Lan; Gong, Nianqiao; Liu, Bin; Lu, Xia; Chen, Dong; Chen, Song; Shu, Hongge; Ma, Ke; Xu, Xizhen; Guo, Zhiliang; Lu, Enfeng; Chen, Dongrui; Ge, Qinggang; Cai, Junchao; Jiang, Jipin; Wei, Lai; Zhang, Weijie; Chen, Gang; Chen, Zhishui",Eur Urol,,696

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the course met with the significant challenge of conversion to an online mode of teaching, instead of planned face-to-face instruction. Providing formative feedback was thought to be an important step to help students succeed in their final CAD project of the course. In the process of designing feedback, we found that the concept of feedback is still fragile in an online learning environment because online learning settings provide distinct pedagogical demands as compared to face-to-face settings. The situation is especially delicate in the context of contemporary higher education imparting engineering skills, where students attend large classes, with diminished opportunities to interact with the teaching staff. The challenge we faced was to provide meaningful dialogic feedback in an online environment, especially while teaching engineering graphics design to a large class. Here we addressed this challenge by focusing on the process of structuring meaningful feedback. We designed a project assignment to be submitted as multiple deliverables to be submitted in two-stages. Then, we characterized its feedback with multiple notions, such as dialogic iterative cycles, personalized, goal-directed, immediate, in written format, and having a peer assessment component. The process of providing formative feedback online through the structure mentioned in this paper resulted in students' improved scores on the final project elements. It also helped us identify the common issues students are faltering in a graphics design class, and provide customized guidance, ideal examples of expected work, and more resources to motivate each student group to achieve mastery of course content.

This paper evaluates the value of two simultaneous initiatives for the economic development of Pakistan, i.e., (i) reforming and modernization of the cadastre system, and (ii) the implementation of national spatial data infrastructure (NSDI). Both can provide crucial frameworks to assemble geographic information necessary for effective agriculture policies in the country. Their execution at the national level requires substantial technical, human, and finical resources. These mega initiatives may become highly challenging, due to the already shrinking economy of the country from COVID-19. The study makes use of an evaluation framework, official documents, such as project proposals, minutes of meetings, in addition to data collected through questionnaire and from ministries, such as the ministry of planning, development, and reforms (commonly known as planning commission), as well as Pakistan bureau of statistics. Our findings indicate that both the projects share some commonalities in terms of benefits, problems, and resources. However, the economic benefits of the NSDI project are high compared to the cadastre for the country, especially for effective agricultural policy-making. The results output will help practitioners from both systems to reduce the overlapping value, cost, and scope of the work involved.","Ali, Asmat Imran Muhammad",Land,,696

""Trained immunity"" of the populace as a result of Bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccination policy implementation and coverage had been suggested to be one of the factors responsible for the differential impact of COVID-19 on different countries. Several trials are underway to evaluate the potential protective role of BCG vaccination in COVID-19. However, the lack of clarity on the use of appropriate controls concerning the measures of ""trained immunity"" or the heterologous cell-mediated immunity conferred by BCG vaccination has been a cause of concern leading to more confusion as exemplified by a recently concluded trial in Israel that failed to find any protective correlation with regard to BCG vaccination. Whereas, when we analyze the COVID-19 epidemiological data of European countries without any regard for BCG vaccination policy but with similar age distribution, comparable confounding variables, and the stage of the pandemic, the prevalence of tuberculin immunoreactivity-a measure of cell-mediated immunity persistence as a result of Mycobacterium spp. (including BCG vaccine) exposure of the populations-is found consistently negatively correlated with COVID-19 infections and mortality. We seek to draw attention toward the inclusion of controls for underlying ""trained immunity"" and heterologous cell-mediated immunity prevalence that may be preexisting or resulting from the intervention (e.g., BCG vaccine) in such trials to arrive at more dependable conclusions concerning potential benefit from them.","Singh, Samer; Maurya, Rajendra Prakash; Singh, Rakesh K",PLoS Pathog,,696

AIM: To develop and evaluate a rapid SARS-CoV-2 specific ELISA for detection of anti-SARS-CoV2 IgG from patients' biological samples. METHODS: In order to develop this ELISA, three panels of samples (n = 184) have been used: panel 1 (n = 19) and panel 2 (n = 60) were collected from RT-PCR positive patients within 14 and after 14 days of onset of clinical symptoms, respectively; whereas panel 3 consisted of negative samples (n = 105) collected either from healthy donors or pre-pandemic dengue patients. As a capturing agent full-length SARS-CoV2 specific recombinant nucleocapsid was immobilized. Commercial SARS-CoV2 IgG kit based on chemiluminescent assay was used for the selection of samples and optimization of the assay. The threshold cut-off point, inter-assay and intra-assay variations were determined. RESULTS: The incubation/reaction time was set at a total of 30 minutes with the sensitivity of 84% (95% confidence interval, CI, 60.4%, 96.6%) and 98% (95% CI, 91.1%, 100.0%), for panel 1 and 2, respectively; with overall 94.9% sensitivity (95% CI 87.5%, 98.6%). Moreover, the clinical specificity was 97.1% (95% CI, 91.9%, 99.4%) with no cross reaction with dengue samples. The overall positive and negative predictive values are 96.2% (95% CI 89.2%, 99.2%) and 96.2% (95% CI, 90.6% 99.0%), respectively. In-house ELISA demonstrated 100% positive and negative percent agreement with Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2, with Cohen's kappa value of 1.00 (very strong agreement), while comparing 13 positive and 17 negative confirmed cases.

RECENT FINDINGS: The severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection is greater in pregnant compared to nonpregnant women as measured by rates of admission to intensive care units, mechanical ventilation, mortality, and morbidities including myocardial infarction, venous thromboembolic and other thrombotic events, preeclampsia, preterm labor, and preterm birth. The risk of transmission from mother-to-infant is relatively low (1.5-5%) as quantitated by neonatal SARS-CoV-2 testing. Infants appear to be at higher risk of testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 if the mother has tested positive within 1 week of delivery or is herself symptomatic at the time of maternity admission. The rate of positivity is not higher in infants who room in with the mother compared to infants who are initially separated and cared for in a SARS-CoV-2-free environment. Infants who test positive in the hospital have no or mild signs of disease, most of which may be attributable to prematurity, and rarely require readmission for clinical signs consistent with COVID-19. SUMMARY: Pregnant women should take precautions to avoid infection with SARS-CoV-2. Infants born to mothers who test positive for SARS-CoV-2 can receive normal neonatal care in-hospital with their mothers if mother and staff adhere to recommended infection control practices.","Hudak, Mark L",Curr Opin Pediatr,,696

In particular, short and long non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) are a class of endogenous BC controllers and include a number of different species including microRNAs, Piwi-interacting RNAs, small nucleolar RNA, short interfering RNAs, and tRNA-derivatives. In this review, we discuss the tumor suppressing roles of ncRNAs in the context of BC, and the mechanisms by which ncRNAs target tumor hallmarks, including apoptosis, proliferation, invasion, metastasis, epithelial-mesenchymal transition, angiogenesis, and cell cycle progression, in addition to their diagnostic and prognostic significance in cancer treatment.","Salimimoghadam, Shokooh; Taefehshokr, Sina; Loveless, Reid; Teng, Yong; Bertoli, Gloria; Taefehshokr, Nima; Musaviaroo, Fatemeh; Hajiasgharzadeh, Khalil; Baradaran, Behzad",Crit Rev Oncol Hematol,,696

These measures are also a signal of other things like systemic risks and weaknesses. A period of quarantine is also a thing in and by itself. What happens after quarantine is thus shaped both by the state of the social-ecological system preceding quarantine and by what happened during quarantine. The selectivities introduced during quarantine span discursive, institutional and material realms. Old discourses can return with a new meaning. Social and economic relations can reappear seemingly unchanged, they can be more visibly altered and they can be dismantled. Ideologies, however, to be understood here as master discourses, read problems and solutions in their own way and do not necessarily come closer to each other or disappear. All this, offers food for thought regarding the possibilities and limits of resilience and transition. We argue that the current COVID- 19 pandemic casts doubt on the generic applicability of theories of resilience and transition, yet also sheds a new light on the value of both. We propose the concept of reinvention to describe what is happening and what could happen in a more coordinated fashion. We argue that the current crisis reveals mechanisms in systems dynamics that point at the existence of multiple pathways after dramatic system shocks. Some shocks and their system- specific responses (such as a particular kind of quarantine) are more amenable to resilience strategies afterwards, while others require a path of radical transition. They might also both be needed: a rather stark transition now might ensure future resilience. While the outline of the system after transition is not clear, some desirable features are clear as are the risks and damages of the current system. Also clear is the argument for transitional governance, a temporary governance system (beyond quarantine) which can enable the construction of new long term perspectives in governance and new governance tools meant to reduce chances of a crisis like this one reoccuring.","Van Assche, Kristof; Duineveld, Martijn; Birchall, S.

350058,Broad neutralizing nanobody against SARS-CoV-2 engineered from pre-designed synthetic library,2021,"Migrant and seasonal farmworkers are a vulnerable population with unique health and safety challenges related to the entire spectrum of the social determinants of health. These challenges place migrant and seasonal farmworkers at a disproportionate risk of infection and illness because of the COVID-19 pandemic. This report presents a case study of an early COVID-19 outbreak among migrant farmworkers in Iowa and describes the role that a nimble and responsive mobile federally qualified health center played in the successful mitigation and response to this outbreak. Early during the pandemic, the clinic adopted a new model of service delivery utilizing telemedicine primary care visits, followed by in-person visits when necessary. As the pandemic progressed, clinic staff strategized to provide increased pandemic-related support to agricultural employers and migrant farmworkers across the state. Emphasis was placed on on-site testing and education regarding social distancing, mask utilization, and hand washing. Eventually, as migrant workers were infected and became symptomatic, more complex mitigation strategies such as isolation, quarantine, and clinical follow-up were also implemented. This report describes how a mobile primary care clinic developed a pandemic responsive model to provide successful mitigation of an early COVID-19 outbreak among essential and highly vulnerable migrant farmworkers.","Corwin, Claudia; Sinnwell, Emily; Culp, Kennith",J Agromedicine,,696

Current occupational health (OH) management of WRSAD is based on clinical and managerial guidelines and individual risk assessment. AIMS: The study sought to identify patterns of OH advice in WRSAD and the relationships between the OH advice, available evidence, experience and expertise of the OH doctors (OHDs). METHODS: A retrospective cross-sectional analysis of 101 first-time OH consultations for WRSAD by nine OHDs. RESULTS: The three most common OH interventions included follow-up OH consultations, adjusted duties and referrals for counselling. All OHDs preferred a light-touch approach but the less experienced and qualified OHDs were more proactive and prescriptive. CONCLUSIONS: In the absence of a specific occupational medical guideline for the management of WRSAD, the OH interventions may be guided by clinical guidelines, individual risk assessment, the client's circumstances or the experience, expertise and preferences of the OHDs. In the study group, OH interventions were under-utilized and not consistently applied. Our findings support the argument for OH guideline for WRSAD to improve the consistency and effectiveness of OH interventions. This is important given the scale of the problem and the recent increase in WRSAD during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Palka, G.; Sen, D.",Occupational Medicine,,696

354257,Comparison of SARS-CoV-2 indirect and direct RT-qPCR detection methods,2021,"BACKGROUND: Central and peripheral nervous system symptoms and complications are being increasingly recognized among individuals with pandemic SARS-CoV-2 infections, but actual detection of the virus or its RNA in the central nervous system has rarely been sought or demonstrated. Severe or fatal illnesses are attributed to SARS-CoV-2, generally without attempting to evaluate for alternative causes or co-pathogens. CASE PRESENTATION: A five-year-old girl with fever and headache was diagnosed with acute SARS-CoV-2-associated meningoencephalitis based on the detection of its RNA on a nasopharyngeal swab, cerebrospinal fluid analysis, and magnetic resonance imaging findings. Serial serologic tests for SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgA showed seroconversion, consistent with an acute infection. Mental status and brain imaging findings gradually worsened despite antiviral therapy and intravenous dexamethasone. Decompressive suboccipital craniectomy for brain herniation with cerebellar biopsy on day 30 of illness, shortly before death, revealed SARS-CoV-2 RNA in cerebellar tissue using the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 2019-nCoV Real-Time Reverse Transcriptase-PCR Diagnostic Panel. On histopathology, necrotizing granulomas with numerous acid-fast bacilli were visualized, and Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex DNA was detected by PCR. Ventricular cerebrospinal fluid that day was negative for mycobacterial DNA. Tracheal aspirate samples for mycobacterial DNA and culture from days 22 and 27 of illness were negative by PCR but grew Mycobacterium tuberculosis after 8 weeks, long after the child's passing. She had no known exposures to tuberculosis and no chest radiographic findings to suggest it. All 6 family members had normal chest radiographs and negative interferon-Î³ release assay results. The source of her tuberculous infection was not identified, and further investigations by the local health department were not possible because of the State of Michigan-mandated lockdown for control of SARS-CoV-2 spread. CONCLUSION: The detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in cerebellar tissue and the demonstration of seroconversion in IgG and IgA assays was consistent with acute SARS-CoV-2 infection of the central nervous infection. However, the cause of death was brain herniation from her rapidly progressive central nervous system tuberculosis. SARS-CoV-2 may mask or worsen occult tuberculous infection with severe or fatal consequences.","Freij, Bishara J; Gebara, Bassam M; Tariq, Rabail; Wang, Ay-Ming; Gibson, John; El-Wiher, Nidal; Krasan, Graham; Patek, Paul M; Levasseur, Kelly A; Amin, Mitual; Fullmer, Joseph M",BMC Pediatr,,696

354503,Can SARS-CoV-2 infect the eye? An overview of the receptor status in ocular tissue,2020,"BACKGROUND: Reducing poverty and improving access to health care are two of the most effective actions to decrease maternal mortality, and conditional cash transfer (CCT) programmes act on both. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of one of the world's largest CCT (the Brazilian Bolsa Familia Programme (BFP)) on maternal mortality during a period of 11 years. METHODS: The study had an ecological longitudinal design and used all 2548 Brazilian municipalities with vital statistics of adequate quality during 2004-2014. BFP municipal coverage was classified into four levels, from low to consolidated, and its duration effects were measured using the average municipal coverage of previous years. We used negative binomial multivariable regression models with fixed-effects specifications, adjusted for all relevant demographic, socioeconomic, and healthcare variables. RESULTS: BFP was significantly associated with reductions of maternal mortality proportionally to its levels of coverage and years of implementation, with a rate ratio (RR) reaching 0.88 (95%CI 0.81-0.95), 0.84 (0.75-0.96) and 0.83 (0.71-0.99) for intermediate, high and consolidated BFP coverage over the previous 11 years. The BFP duration effect was stronger among young mothers (RR 0.77; 95%CI 0.67-0.96). BFP was also associated with reductions in the proportion of pregnant women with no prenatal visits (RR 0.73; 95%CI 0.69-0.77), reductions in hospital case-fatality rate for delivery (RR 0.78; 95%CI 0.66-0.94) and increases in the proportion of deliveries in hospital (RR 1.05; 95%CI 1.04-1.07). CONCLUSION: Our findings show that a consolidated and durable CCT coverage could decrease maternal mortality, and these long-term effects are stronger among poor mothers exposed to CCT during their childhood and adolescence, suggesting a CCT inter-generational effect. Sustained CCT coverage could reduce health inequalities and contribute to the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goal 3.1, and should be preserved during the current global economic crisis due to the COVID-19 pandemic.","Rasella, Davide; Alves, Flávia Jôse Oliveira; Rebouças, Poliana; de Jesus, Gabriela Santos; Barreto, Maurício L; Campello, Tereza; Paixao, Enny S",BMC Med,,696

To date in higher volume centres and by experienced operators MitraClip is used for the treatment of complex anatomies and challenging cases in high risk-inoperable patients. This progressive step is superimposable to what observed in surgery for edge-to-edge surgery (Alfieri's technique). Moreover, the results of clinical studies on the treatment of patients with high surgical risk and functional mitral insufficiency have confirmed that the main goal to be achieved for improving clinical outcomes of patients with severe mitral regurgitation (MR) is the reduction of MR itself. The MitraClip should therefore be considered as a tool to achieve this goal in addition to medical therapy. Nowadays, evaluation of patient's candidacy to MitraClip procedure, discussed in local Heart Team, must take into account not only the clinical features of patients but even the experience of the operators and the volume of the centre, which are mostly related to the probability to achieve good procedural results. This 'relative feasibility' of challenges cases by experienced operators should always been taken into account in selecting patients for MitraClip. Here, we present a review of the literature available on the treatment of complex and challenging lesions.","Gavazzoni, Mara; Taramasso, Maurizio; Zuber, Michel; Russo, Giulio; Pozzoli, Alberto; Miura, Mizuki; Maisano, Francesco",European heart journal.

The main feature of IPF is a heterogeneous appearance with areas of sub-pleural fibrosis. However, the mechanism of sub-pleural fibrosis was poorly understood. In this study, our in vivo study revealed that pleural mesothelial cells (PMCs) migrated into lung parenchyma and localized alongside lung fibroblasts in sub-pleural area in mouse pulmonary fibrosis. Our in vitro study displayed that cultured-PMCs-medium induced lung fibroblasts transforming into myofibroblast, cultured-fibroblasts-medium promoted mesothelial-mesenchymal transition of PMCs. Furthermore, these changes in lung fibroblasts and PMCs were prevented by blocking TGF-ß1/Smad2/3 signaling with SB431542. TGF-ß1 neutralized antibody attenuated bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis. Similar to TGF-ß1/Smad2/3 signaling, wnt/ß-catenin signaling was also activated in the process of PMCs crosstalk with lung fibroblasts. Moreover, inhibition of CD147 attenuated cultured-PMCs-medium induced collagen-I synthesis in lung fibroblasts. Blocking CD147 signaling also prevented bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis. Our data indicated that crosstalk between PMC and lung fibroblast contributed to sub-pleural pulmonary fibrosis. TGF-ß1, Wnt/ß-catenin and CD147 signaling was involved in the underling mechanism.","Liu, Fei; Yu, Fan; Lu, Yu-Zhi; Cheng, Pei-Pei; Liang, Li-Mei; Wang, Meng; Chen, Shuai-Jun; Huang, Yi; Song, Lin-Jie; He, Xin-Liang; Xiong, Liang; Xin, Jian-Bao; Ma, Wan-Li; Ye, Hong",Biochim Biophys Acta Mol Cell Res,,696

363413,High neutralizing potency of swine glyco-humanized polyclonal antibodies against SARS-CoV-2,2021,"To allow previewing a web page, social media platforms have developed social cards: visualizations consisting of vital information about the underlying resource. At a minimum, social cards often include features such as the web resource's title, text summary, striking image, and domain name. News and scholarly articles on the web are frequently subject to social card creation when being shared on social media. However, we noticed that not all web resources offer sufficient metadata elements to enable appealing social cards. For example, the COVID-19 emergency has made it clear that scholarly articles, in particular, are at an aesthetic disadvantage in social media platforms when compared to their often more flashy disinformation rivals. Also, social cards are often not generated correctly for archived web resources, including pages that lack or predate standards for specifying striking images. With these observations, we are motivated to quantify the levels of inclusion of required metadata in web resources, its evolution over time for archived resources, and create and evaluate an algorithm to automatically select a striking image for social cards. We find that more than 40% of archived news articles sampled from the NEWSROOM dataset and 22% of scholarly articles sampled from the PubMed Central dataset fail to supply striking images. We demonstrate that we can automatically predict the striking image with a Precision@1 of 0.83 for news articles from NEWSROOM and 0.78 for scholarly articles from the open access journal PLOS ONE.","Jones, Shawn M.; Weigle, Michele C.; Klein, Martin; Nelson, Michael L.",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.04899v1.pdf,696

METHODS: Pre-operative computed tomography images from 194 patients undergoing HTO for medial knee OA and 118 non-arthritic controls were utilized. All patients had varus knee alignment (mean age: 57 ± 11 years; 45% female). The hip-knee-ankle (HKA) angle, mechanical lateral distal femoral angle (mLDFA), medial proximal tibial angle (MPTA) and non-weight-bearing joint line convergence angle (nwJLCA) were compared between ""control group"" and ""HTO group"". Femoral and tibial phenotypes were also assessed and compared between groups. Variables found on univariate analysis to be different between the groups were entered into a binary logistic regression model. RESULTS: The mean age was lower (&#916; = 4 ± 6 years, p = 0.024), body mass index (BMI) was higher (&#916; = 1.1 ± 2.8 kg/m2, p = 0.032) and there were more females (&#916; = 14%, p = 0.020) in the HTO group. The HTO group had more overall varus (7° ± 4.7° vs 4.8° ± 1.3°, p < 0.001). There was a significant difference in the mean mLDFA between the two groups with the HTO group having more femoral varus (88.7 ± 3.2° vs 87.3 ± 1.8°, p < 0.001). MPTA was similar between the groups (p = 0.881). Age was found to be a strong determinant for femoral varus (p = 0.03). CONCLUSION: Patients undergoing HTO for medial knee OA have more femoral varus compared to non-arthritic controls while tibial morphology was similar. This will be an important consideration in pre-operating planning for realignment osteotomy in patients presenting with medial knee OA and warrants further investigation.

In this study, we aimed to identify the transmission dynamics of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections and assess the impact of COVID-19 case finding and contact tracing in each epidemic wave. METHODS: We collected data on COVID-19 cases published by local public health authorities in South Korea and divided the study into two epidemic periods (19 January-19 April 2020 for the first epidemic wave and 20 April-11 August 2020 for the second epidemic wave). To identify changes in the transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2, the daily effective reproductive number (Rt) was estimated using the illness onset of the cases. Furthermore, to identify the characteristics of each epidemic wave, frequencies of cluster types were measured, and age-specific transmission probability matrices and serial intervals were estimated. The proportion of asymptomatic cases and cases with unknown sources of infection were also estimated to assess the changes of infections identified as cases in each wave. RESULTS: In early May 2020, within 2-weeks of a relaxation in strict social distancing measures, Rt increased rapidly from 0.2 to 1.8 within a week and was around 1 until early July 2020. In both epidemic waves, the most frequent cluster types were religious-related activities and transmissions among the same age were more common. Furthermore, children were rarely infectors or infectees, and the mean serial intervals were similar (~ 3 days) in both waves. The proportion of asymptomatic cases at presentation increased from 22% (in the first wave) to 27% (in the second wave), while the cases with unknown sources of infection were similar in both waves (22 and 24%, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Our study shows that relaxing social distancing measures was associated with increased SARS-CoV-2 transmission despite rigorous case findings in South Korea. Along with social distancing measures, the enhanced contact tracing including asymptomatic cases could be an efficient approach to control further epidemic waves.","Ryu, Sukhyun; Ali, Sheikh Taslim; Noh, Eunbi; Kim, Dasom; Lau, Eric H Y; Cowling, Benjamin J",BMC Infect Dis,,696

Pelvic and lower limb MR images of 378 patients with vascular malformations were examined retrospectively. Pain levels and restriction of motion were evaluated with a questionnaire. Cross-sectional areas of affected nerves were compared at standardized anatomical landmarks. Intraneural infiltration patterns and involvement of muscles surrounding the sciatic nerve were documented. Sciatic nerve infiltration occurred in 23/299 patients (7.7%) with VM. In all cases (23/23; 100%), gluteal or hamstring muscles surrounding the nerve were affected by the VM. Infiltrated nerves were enlarged and showed signal alterations (T2-hyperintensity) compared to the unaffected side. Enlarged nerve cross-sectional areas were associated with elevated pain levels. Three nerve infiltration patterns were observed: subepineurial (12/23; 52.2%), subparaneurial (6/23; 26.1%) and combined (5/23; 21.7%) infiltration. This study provides a clinically relevant assessment for sciatic nerve infiltration patterns and muscle involvement of VMs, while suggesting that VMs in gluteal and hamstring muscles require closer investigation of the sciatic nerve by the radiologist.","Goldann, Constantin; Helm, Maximilian; Uller, Wibke; Fellner, Claudia; Hammer, Simone; Deistung, Andreas; Gussew, Alexander; Rosendahl, Jonas; Wildgruber, Moritz; Wohlgemuth, Walther A; Brill, Richard",Sci Rep,,696

We aimed to assess the associations between prior use of RAAS inhibitors and clinical outcomes among Korean patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). METHODS: We performed a nationwide population-based cohort study using the Korean Health Insurance Review and Assessment database. Claim records were screened for 69 793 individuals who were tested for COVID-19 until 8 April 2020. Adjusted odds ratios (ORs) were used to compare the clinical outcomes between RAAS inhibitor users and nonusers. RESULTS: Among 5179 confirmed COVID-19 cases, 762 patients were RAAS inhibitor users and 4417 patients were nonusers. Relative to nonusers, RAAS inhibitor users were more likely to be older, male, and have comorbidities. Among 1954 hospitalized patients with COVID-19, 377 patients were RAAS inhibitor users, and 1577 patients were nonusers.

376818,Emergence of a new SARS-CoV-2 variant in the UK,2020,"Lockdown measures in response to the COVID-19 pandemic involve placing huge burdens on some members of society for the sake of benefiting other members of society. How should we decide when these policies are permissible? Many writers propose we should address this question using cost-benefit analysis (CBA), a broadly consequentialist approach. We argue for an alternative non-consequentialist approach, grounded in contractualist moral theorising. The first section sets up key issues in the ethics of lockdown, and sketches the apparent appeal of addressing these problems in a CBA frame. The second section argues that CBA fundamentally distorts the normative landscape in two ways: first, in principle, it allows very many morally trivial preferences-say, for a coffee-might outweigh morally weighty life-and-death concerns; second, it is insensitive to the core moral distinction between victims and vectors of disease. The third section sketches our non-consequentialist alternative, grounded in Thomas Scanlon's contractualist moral theory. On this account, the ethics of self-defence implies a strong default presumption in favour of a highly restrictive, universal lockdown policy: we then ask whether there are alternatives to such a policy which are justifiable to all affected parties, paying particular attention to the complaints of those most burdened by policy. In the fourth section, we defend our contractualist approach against the charge that it is impractical or counterintuitive, noting that actual CBAs face similar, or worse, challenges.","John, Stephen David; Curran, Emma J",J. med. ethics,,696

The aim of this study was to compare patient-performed testing based on a morning saliva sample with the current standard testing method, healthcare worker-collected sampling via a nasopharyngeal swab (NPS). METHODS: This was a prospective single center study which recruited 217 asymptomatic adult male participants in a COVID-19 quarantine center who had tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 8-10 days prior isolation. Paired NPS and saliva specimens were collected and processed within 5 hours of sample collection. Real time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) targeting Envelope (E) and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) genes was performed and the results were compared. RESULTS: Overall, 160 of the 217 (74%) participants tested positive for Covid-19 based on saliva, NPS, or both testing methods. The detection rate for SARS-CoV-2 was higher in saliva compared to NPS testing (93.1%, 149/160 vs 52.5%, 84/160, p<0.001). The concordance between the two tests was 45.6% (virus was detected in both saliva and NPS in 73/160), while 47.5% were discordant (87/160 tested positive for one while negative for the other). The Ct values for E and RdRp genes were significantly lower in saliva specimens compared to NP swab specimens. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings demonstrate that saliva is a better alternative specimen for detection of SARS-CoV-2. Taking into consideration, the simplicity of specimen collection, shortage of PPE and the transmissibility of the virus, saliva could enable self-collection for an accurate SARS-CoV-2 surveillance testing.","Rao, Mohan; Rashid, Fairuz A; Sabri, Fashihah S A H; Jamil, Nur Nadia; Zain, Rozainanee; Hashim, Rohaidah; Amran, Fairuz; Kok, Huey Tean; Samad, Md Anuar Abd; Ahmad, Norazah",Clin. infect. dis,,696

Despite several measures, SARS-CoV-2 has been extremely impactful due to its extraordinary infection potential mainly through coronavirus-borne saliva respiratory and droplet nuclei of an infected person and its considerable stability on surfaces. Although the disease has affected over 180 countries, its extent and control are significantly different across the globe, making it a strong case for exploration of its behavior and dependence across various environmental pathways and its interactions with the virus. This has spurred efforts to characterize the coronavirus and understand the factors impacting its transmission and survival such as aerosols, air quality, meteorology, chemical compositions and characteristics of particles and surfaces, which are directly or indirectly associated with coronaviruses infection spread. Nonetheless, many peer-reviewed articles have studied these aspects but mostly in isolation; a complete array of coronavirus survival and transmission from an infected individual through air- and water-borne channels and its subsequent intractions with environmental factors, surfaces, particulates and chemicals is not comprehensively explored. Particulate matter (PM) is omnipresent with variable concentrations, structures and composition, while most of the surfaces are also covered by PM of different characteristics. Learning from the earlier coronavirus studies, including SARS and MERS, an attempt has been made to understand the survival of SARS-CoV-2 outside of the host body and discuss the probable air and water-borne transmission routes and its interactions with the outside environment. The present work 1) Helps appreciate the role of PM, its chemical constituents and surface characteristics and 2) Further identifies gaps in this field and suggests possible domains to work upon for better understanding of transmission and survival of this novel coronavirus.","Wathore, Roshan; Gupta, Ankit; Bherwani, Hemant; Labhasetwar, Nitin",Sci Total Environ,,696

The most urgent need is to find effective treatments. We sought to determine whether hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) application may reduce the death risk of critically ill COVID-19 patients. In this retrospective study, we included 550 critically ill COVID-19 patients who need mechanical ventilation in Tongji Hospital, Wuhan, from February 1, 2020 to April 4, 2020. All 550 patients received comparable basic treatments including antiviral drugs and antibiotics, and 48 of them were treated with oral HCQ treatment (200 mg twice a day for 7-10 days) in addition to the basic treatments. Primary endpoint is fatality of patients, and inflammatory cytokine levels were compared between HCQ and non-hydroxychloroquine (NHCQ) treatments. We found that fatalities are 18.8% (9/48) in HCQ group, which is significantly lower than 47.4% (238/502) in the NHCQ group (P<0.001). The time of hospital stay before patient death is 15 (10-21) days and 8 (4-14) days for the HCQ and NHCQ groups, respectively (P<0.05). The levels of inflammatory cytokine IL-6 were significantly reduced from 22.2 (8.3-118.9) pg mL-1 at the beginning of the treatment to 5.2 (3.0-23.4) pg mL-1 (P<0.05) at the end of the treatment in the HCQ group but there is no change in the NHCQ group.

378764,The SARS-CoV-2 conserved macrodomain is a mono-ADP-ribosylhydrolase,2020,"BACKGROUND: Data on SARS-CoV-2 transmission among children living with healthcare workers (HCWs) are scarce. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was performed at a tertiary Hospital in Madrid, including children of HCW who suffered from SARS-CoV-2 infection between March and May 2020. Children underwent enzyme-linked immunosorbent serological study for detecting SARS-CoV-2 antibodies: VIRCELL IgG assay. RESULTS: One hundred thirteen children from 69 HCWs with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection were recruited: 47 children had positive IgG (41.6%). Children secondary attack rate was 43.7% (25% if both parents have had asymptomatic infection; 39.5% if one parent was symptomatic; and 47% when both parents had symptoms). Having a positive sibling was associated with a positive IgG result (odds ratio = 12.2; 95% confidence interval: 4.4-33.7, P < 0.001). Median age was higher in IgG positive children (P = 0.022). Children who referred anosmia presented higher IgG titles (P < 0.04). CONCLUSIONS: We observed a very high SARS-CoV-2 transmission in children of HCW during the first pandemic wave, especially when both parents were symptomatic. Having a positive sibling was associated with seroconversion, supporting the important role of family clusters in the transmission of SARS-CoV-2.","Méndez-Echevarría, Ana; Sainz, Talía; de Felipe, Beatriz; Alcolea, Sonia; Olbrich, Peter; Goycochea-Valdivia, Walter A; Escosa-García, Luis; Cobo, Lorena; Calvo, Cristina; Neth, Olaf",Pediatr Infect Dis J,,696

With this study we investigated the perceptions of doctors and nurses on hybridization in clinical directorates (CDs) in hospitals. METHODS: We investigated the attitudes of healthcare professionals (doctors and nurses) towards eight hospital CDs in the Local Health Authority (LHA) of Bologna (Emilia Romagna, Italy) 6 years after their implementation. We used a validated questionnaire by Braithwaite and Westbrook (2004). Drawing on Palmer et al. (2007), we added a section about the characteristics of department heads. In all, 123 healthcare professionals in managerial roles completed and returned the questionnaire. The return rate was 47.4% for doctors and 31.6% for nurses. RESULTS: Doctors reported an increase in clinical governance, interdisciplinarity collaboration, and standardization of clinical work. Hybridization of practices was noted to have taken place. While doctors did not see these changes as a threat to professional values, they felt that hospital managers had taken greater control. There was a large overlap of attitudes between doctors and nurses: inter-professional integration in CDs fostered alignment of values and aims. The polarity index was higher for responses from the doctors than from the nurses. CONCLUSION: The study findings have implications for policy makers and managers: mission and strategic mandate of CDs; governance of CDs, leadership issues; opportunities for engaging healthcare professionals; changes in managerial involvement during the COVID-19 pandemic. We also discuss the limitations of the present study and future areas for research into hybrid structures.","Prenestini, Anna; Sartirana, Marco; Lega, Federico",BMC Health Serv Res,,696

Due to the frequent detection of boscalid, we evaluated its impact on the reproduction of adult zebrafish following a 21 d exposure to 0, 0.01, 0.1, and 1.0 mg/L. Following exposure to boscalid, the fertility of female zebrafish and fertilization rate of spawning eggs were reduced in a concentration-dependent manner up to a respective 87% and 20% in the highest concentration. A significant 16% reduction in the percentage of late vitellogenic oocytes was noted in ovaries, and a significant 74% reduction in the percentage of spermatids in testis was also observed after treatment with 1.0 mg/L. 17ß-Estradiol (E2) concentrations decreased significantly in females (34% decrease) but significantly increased in males (15% increase) following 1.0 mg/L boscalid treatment. The expression of genes (such as era, er2b, cyp19a, and cyp19b) related to the hypothalamus-pituitary-gonad-liver (HPGL) axis was significantly altered and positively correlated with E2 concentrations in female and male zebrafish (p < 0.05). Molecular docking results revealed that the binding modes between boscalid and target proteins (ER and CYP19) of zebrafish were similar to that of the reference compounds and the target proteins. The binding energies indicate that boscalid may have a weak estrogen-like binding effect or CYP19 inhibition, potentially altering the HPGL axis, thereby reducing E2 concentrations and fecundity in females. In contrast, boscalid caused significant induction of E2 steroidogenesis and subsequent feminization of gonads in males, indicating gender-specific adverse outcome pathways.","Qian, Le; Qi, Suzhen; Zhang, Jie; Duan, Manman; Schlenk, Daniel; Jiang, Jiazhen; Wang, Chengju",Environ Sci Technol,,696
386060,The Lambda variant of SARS-CoV-2 has a better chance than the Delta variant to escape vaccines,2021,"Europe is experiencing a third wave of COVID-19 due to the spread of highly transmissible SARS-CoV-2 variants A number of positive and negative factors constantly shape the rates of COVID-19 infections, hospitalization, and mortality Among these factors, the rise in increasingly transmissible variants on one side and the effect of vaccinations on the other side create a picture deeply different from that of the first pandemic wave Starting from the observation that in several European countries the number of COVID-19 infections in the second and third pandemic wave increased without a proportional rise in disease severity and mortality, we hypothesize the existence of an additional factor influencing SARS-CoV-2 dynamics This factor consists of an immune defence against severe COVID-19, provided by SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells progressively developing upon natural exposure to low virus doses present in populated environments As suggested by recent studies, low-dose viral particles entering the respiratory and intestinal tracts may be able to induce T cell memory in the absence of inflammation, potentially resulting in different degrees of immunization In this scenario, non-pharmaceutical interventions would play a double role, one in the short term by reducing the detrimental spreading of SARS-CoV-2 particles, and one in the long term by allowing the development of a widespread (although heterogeneous and uncontrollable) form of immune protection","De Angelis, Maria Laura Francescangeli Federica Rossi Rachele Giuliani Alessandro De Maria Ruggero Zeuner Ann",Viruses,,696

VRK-1, the single Caenorhabditis elegans VRK ortholog, functions in cell division and germline proliferation. However, the role of VRK-1 in postmitotic cells and adult life span remains unknown. Here, we show that VRK-1 increases organismal longevity by activating the cellular energy sensor, AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), via direct phosphorylation. We found that overexpression of vrk-1 in the soma of adult C. elegans increased life span and, conversely, inhibition of vrk-1 decreased life span. In addition, vrk-1 was required for longevity conferred by mutations that inhibit C. elegans mitochondrial respiration, which requires AMPK. VRK-1 directly phosphorylated and up-regulated AMPK in both C. elegans and cultured human cells. Thus, our data show that the somatic nuclear kinase, VRK-1, promotes longevity through AMPK activation, and this function appears to be conserved between C. elegans and humans.","Park, Sangsoon; Artan, Murat; Han, Seung Hyun; Park, Hae-Eun H; Jung, Yoonji; Hwang, Ara B; Shin, Won Sik; Kim, Kyong-Tai; Lee, Seung-Jae V",Sci.

More specifically, this research focuses on the public opinion of undocumented immigrants in the United States and having access to the Internet in their local settings. The term Undocumented Immigrants refers to those who live in the United States without legal papers, documents, or visas. Undocumented immigrants may have come into the country unlawfully or with valid documentation, but their legal status has expired. Using the 2020 American National Election Studies (ANES) time series dataset, I investigated the relationship between internet access (A2I) and public perception of undocumented immigrants. According to my research and analysis, increasing internet access among non-Hispanic whites with at least a bachelors degree with an annual household income of less than 99K is more likely to oppose the deportation of undocumented immigrants and separating unaccompanied children from their families in borderland areas. The individuals with substantial Republican political ideology exhibit significantly lower opposing effects in deporting undocumented immigrants or separating unaccompanied children from their families. The evidence from multiple statistical models is resilient to a variety of factors. The findings show that increased internet access may improve undocumented immigrants social integration and acceptability. During health emergencies, it may be especially beneficial to make them feel safe, included, and supported in their local settings.","Afzal, Muhammad Hassan Bin",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2110.07489v1.pdf,696

All patients aged 18-65 who had not any comorbidity participated in the study. The diagnosis of COVID-19 was established using the rRT-PCR test for SARS-CoV-2 detection. Then the incidence of lung involvement and biochemical markers including vitamin D level, c-reactive protein, D-dimer, lymphocyte count, platelet count, white blood cell count, and lactic acid dehydrogenase, were extracted through medical records. RESULTS: Altogether, 84 patients met our study criteria, and the information of 68 (80.9%) participants were collected. Among all 68 patients, 45 (66.2%) were male. The mean (SD) age of all participants was 52.4 (10.4) years old. Among 24 (35.2%) clients who died due to SARS-CoV-2, 20 (83.3%) patients were male (p=0.02). The mean (SD) of vitamin D level was 24.1 (13.6) ng/dL. No association between vitamin D level and prognostic factors, including CRP, lymphocyte count, D-dimer, LDH, and HRCT scan score, was observed. Also, the vitamin D level of the dead patients was not significantly different from that of the treated patients.

Research has not explored whether this increased risk is consistent across the US. OBJECTIVE: This study compared COVID-19 case-fatality rates among people with IDD in 11 states and the District of Columbia that are publicly reporting data. METHODS: Cumulative data reported through March 31 - April 13, 2021 were analyzed. Case-fatality rates and risk ratio with 95% confidence intervals for IDD settings were compared the overall case-fatality rate for the jurisdictions from Johns Hopkins' Center for Systems Science and Engineering COVID-19 data. RESULTS: Settings were reported as receiving any services, community or institutional residential services, or living in own/family home. Comparison of case-fatality rates between people with IDD and their respective jurisdiction populations demonstrates that case-fatality rates were consistently higher for people with IDD living in congregate residential settings (fifteen instances) and receiving 24/7 nursing services (two instances). Results were mixed for people with IDD living in their own or a family home (eight instances). CONCLUSIONS: These findings highlight that people with IDD, especially those living in residential settings, are experiencing higher case-fatality rates from COVID-19 than the general population across multiple US jurisdictions. Short-term and long-term public health interventions addressing COVID-19 risks will not be able to properly address the needs of people with IDD until all states begin reporting COVID-19 outcomes for this population.","Landes, Scott D; Turk, Margaret A; Ervin, David A",Disabil Health J,,696

A total of 14,866 subjects from 10 studies were included in the meta-analysis. Higher levels of RDW were associated with adverse outcomes in COVID-19 patients (mean differences = 0.72; 95% CI = 0.47-0.97; I2 = 89.51%). Deceased patients had higher levels of RDW compared to patients who survived (mean differences = 0.93; 95% CI = 0.63-1.23; I2 = 85.58%). Severely ill COVID-19 patients showed higher levels of RDW, as opposed to patients classified to have milder symptoms (mean differences = 0.61; 95% CI = 0.28-0.94; I2 = 82.18%). Elevated RDW levels were associated with adverse outcomes in COVID-19 patients. This finding warrants further research on whether RDW could be utilized as a simple and reliable biomarker for predicting COVID-19 severity and whether RDW is mechanistically linked with COVID-19 pathophysiology.","Lee, Jane J; Montazerin, Sahar M; Jamil, Adeel; Jamil, Umer; Marszalek, Jolanta; Chuang, Michael L; Chi, Gerald",J Med Virol,,696

402313,Increased frequency of recurrent in-frame deletions in new expanding lineages of SARS CoV-2 reflects immune selective pressure,2021,"Cybersecurity threats are estimated to cost the world US $6 trillion a year by 2021, and the number of attacks has increased five-fold after COVID-19. Although there is substantial literature on the threats technological vulnerabilities have on the health care industry, less research exists on how pandemics like COVID-19 are opportunistic for cybercriminals. This paper outlines why cyberattacks have been particularly problematic during COVID-19 and ways that health care industries can better protect patient data. The Office for Civil Rights has loosened enforcement of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, which, although useful in using new platforms like Zoom, has also loosened physical and technical safeguards to cyberattacks. This is especially problematic given that 90% of health care providers had already encountered data breaches. Companies must implement well-defined software upgrade procedures, should use secure networks like virtual local area networks, and conduct regular penetration tests of their systems. By understanding factors that make individuals, health care organizations, and employers more susceptible to cyberattacks, we can better prepare for the next pandemic.","Williams, Christina Meilee; Chaturvedi, Rahul; Chakravarthy, Krishnan",J Med Internet Res,,696
404110,A Rapid Saliva Test for Monitoring Immune Protection against SARS-CoV-2 and its Variants,2021,"BACKGROUND: the COVID-19 pandemic has caused problems with respirator supplies. Reuse may minimise the impact of the shortage but requires the availability of an efficient and safe decontamination method. AIM: our objective is to determine whether the low-temperature-steam-2%-formaldehyde (LTSF) sterilisation process is effective, preserves the properties of filtering facepiece (FFP) respirators and allows safe reuse. METHODS: 14 unused FFP2, FFP3 and N95 respirator models were subjected to two decontamination cycles. After the second cycle, each model was visually inspected and accumulated residual formaldehyde levels were analysed according to the EN 14180. After one and two cycles, Fit factor (FF) was tested on all models and penetration tests with sodium chloride (NaCl) aerosols were additionally performed on five models. FINDINGS: decontamination physically altered three of the 14 models. All the residual formaldehyde values were below the permissible threshold. Irregular FF decreases and increases were observed after each cycle. In the sodium chloride (NaCl) aerosol penetration test, three devices obtained equivalent or superior results to those of the FFP classification with which they were marketed, both at the baseline level and after one and two decontamination cycles. Two other devices reduced their filtering capacity. CONCLUSION: One and two sterilisation cycles using LTSF do not alter the structure of most (11/14) respirators tested and did not degrade the fit or filtration capacity of any of the analysed respirators. The residual formaldehyde levels comply with the EN 14180 standard. This reprocessing method could be used in times of shortage of personal protective equipment.","Haro, García; Bischofberger Valdés, Cornelia; Vicente-Guijarro, Jorge; Díaz-Agero Pérez, Cristina; Fabregate-Fuente, Martín; Moreno-Nunez, Paloma; Aranaz Andrés, Jesús María",J. hosp. infect,,696

The latter is associated with a variety of hyperkinetic disorders that are rare but disabling and potentially preventable. We conducted a systematic review of the potential association between diabetic retinopathy and the risk and prognosis of hyperkinetic disorders in patients with diabetes. We identified a total of 461 articles and 147 were eligible for review. Nine out of 147 articles (6.12%) reported 13 patients with information on diabetic retinopathy. Glycemic fluctuations were present at onset in 10 patients (77%) and retinopathy was present in nine of them (69.23%). The degree of retinopathy was reported in four patients. Two had severe, bilateral proliferative retinopathy, one had moderate-to-severe non-proliferative retinopathy and one had non-proliferative retinopathy. In the nine patients with retinopathy, hyperkinesia persisted, required higher doses of dopamine receptor antagonists or deep brain stimulation. Retinopathy was absent in four cases (30.77%). In these patients, hyperkinesia resolved spontaneously or with lower doses of dopamine receptor antagonists. Diabetic retinopathy could be an indirect marker of striatopallidal microangiopathy in patients with diabetes. The severity of retinopathy may be associated with increased risk or worse prognosis for patients who develop hyperkinetic disorders of the diabetic striatopathy spectrum. Early detection of retinopathy could identify patients in which avoiding glycemic fluctuations may prevent the development of striatopathy and hyperkinetic disorders.","Lizarraga, Karlo J; Chunga, Natalia; Yannuzzi, Nicolas A; Flynn, Harry W; Singer, Carlos; Lang, Anthony E",Parkinsonism relat. disord,,696

407929,Evaluation of SARS-CoV-2 RNA quantification by RT-LAMP compared to RT-qPCR,2021,"BACKGROUND: Mosquito coil (MC) is widely used to repel mosquitoes in order to prevent malaria in many malaria-endemic countries. Although we are fully aware and concerned about carbon monoxide (CO) and its toxicity, exposure to CO from common, though occult sources like MC smoke is often overlooked. Equally, the adverse health effects, especially to the brain, are usually underestimated. OBJECTIVE: To assess the effects of exposure to CO from MC smoke inhalation on spatial memory in mice. METHODS: Sixteen, adult, male, mice, were randomly assigned to either the experimental or the control group; each having 8 mice. The experimental group was exposed to the MC smoke (Wavetide, China) that was allowed to burn inside the gas chamber (75 cm x 50 cm x 50 cm) for 15 minutes, daily, for 14 days. Digital CO meter (PCMM05 Pyle) was used to measure the amount of CO and Barnes maze protocol to assess the spatial memory. RESULTS: Our results indicate that burning MC for 15 minutes produced up to 312 parts per million (ppm) of CO and raised the blood carboxy-hemoglobin (COHb) level by 15.8%. This is higher than the WHO recommended limit (<100 mg/m3 or 87 ppm for 15 min.) of CO exposure and the %COHb level of <2%. Mosquito coil smoke was also associated with impaired spatial memory. However, the dose and duration of exposure did not significantly affect weight gain in the mice. CONCLUSION: Although widely used to prevent malaria, MC could serve as a potential source of CO and other neurotoxins that could be harmful to the brain; the use and toxicity of which is mostly overlooked even by the public health professionals.","Kurawa, Musa Ibrahim; Magaji, Rabiu AbduSSalam; Yusuf, Tanko; Magaji, Mohammed Garba",Niger J Physiol Sci,,696

In South Korea, which had been called the Hepatitis Kingdom, KIM developed a vaccine material for hepatitis B. Through his research achievements, South Korea, emerged from a country ignorant of hepatitis to a country with a hepatitis B vaccine. It is not easy to achieve remarkable results in developing countries where scientific development is lagging. This environment, however, helped KIM achieve his research. This article explains that the two circumstances affected his achievement in his research. First, KIM got a chance to study in the U.S. when he was his starting as a researcher. In the 1960s, the scientific and medical education environment in Korea was still poor. KIM left for Harvard University with the support of CMB, where he was able to advance his studies. This experience was an opportunity to further enhance his research skills. Second, Korea's poor health and hygiene environment in the 1970s worked in favor of verifying the effectiveness of vaccine materials he developed. South Korea, where hepatitis B was prevalent, became a good research site to secure enough test subjects. KIM also used blood sellers to find out the effects of the vaccine material he developed. Blood sellers are people who earn their living by selling their own blood and were commonly found in Korea at that time. The situation in Korea in the 1970s with prevailing hepatitis and the presence of blood sellers played an important role in KIM's research. His research on vaccine development for hepatitis B was hard to imagine in the scientific research environment of South Korea at the time. However, it was also this context and environment of South Korea at the time that enabled his achievement of developing a hepatitis B vaccine.","Shin, Miyoung",Uisahak,,696

Due to ventilator shortage and healthcare systems strain, affordable interventions such as awake prone positioning has been used to improve oxygenation, however, the effect of this intervention on patient-important outcomes is uncertain. The COVI-PRONE trial aims to determine if awake prone positioning in hypoxemic COVID-19 patients reduces the need for invasive mechanical ventilation. Study designA pragmatic, multicenter, international, parallel-group, and stratified randomized controlled trial, aiming to enrol 400 hospitalized adults with COVID-19. ParticipantsThe target population is hospitalized adults with confirmed or suspected COVID-19, hypoxemia that requires [≥]40% oxygen or [≥] 5 L/min by nasal cannula, and abnormal chest x-ray. We will exclude patients with any of the following: immediate need for intubation; altered mental status; contraindication to prone positioning; hemodynamic instability; body mass index > 40 kg/m2; third trimester pregnancy; do not intubate status; previous enrolment or intubation within the same hospital admission; and prone positioning for more than one day prior to randomization. Study intervention and controlFollowing informed a priori or deferred consent, eligible patients will be centrally randomized to either the intervention arm (prone positioning) or standard of care (no prone positioning). Patients randomized to the prone position will be required to either self-prone or assist-prone for a total of eight to ten hours per day until they meet pre-specified stopping criteria. Study outcomesThe primary outcome is invasive mechanical ventilation at 30-days of randomization. Other outcomes include mortality at 60 days, invasive and non-invasive mechanical ventilation free days at 30 days, hospital length of stay at 60 days, days alive and outside of the hospital at 60 days, complications of proning, and serious adverse events.","Duhailib, Zainab Al; Arabi, Yaseen; Culgin, Sarah; Weatherald, Jason; Parhar, Ken Kuljit S.; Nelson, Kate; Tamim, Hani; Alhazzani, Waleed",,,696

METHODS: Data were obtained from 41 hospitals participating in the prospective Feedback Intervention and Treatment Times in ST-Elevation Myocardial Infarction (FITT-STEMI) study, including 15,800 patients treated for acute STEMI from January 2017 to the end of March 2020. RESULTS: There was a 12.6% decrease in the total number of STEMI patients treated at the peak of the pandemic in March 2020 as compared to the mean number treated in the March months of the preceding years. This was accompanied by a significant difference among the modes of admission to hospitals (p = 0.017) with a particular decline in intra-hospital infarctions and transfer patients from other hospitals, while the proportion of patients transported by emergency medical service (EMS) remained stable. In EMS-transported patients, predefined quality indicators, such as percentages of pre-hospital ECGs (both 97%, 95% CI = - 2.2-2.7, p = 0.846), direct transports from the scene to the catheterization laboratory bypassing the emergency department (68% vs. 66%, 95% CI = - 4.9-7.9, p = 0.641), and contact-to-balloon-times of less than or equal to 90 min (58.3% vs. 57.8%, 95%CI = - 6.2-7.2, p = 0.879) were not significantly altered during the COVID-19 crisis, as was in-hospital mortality (9.2% vs. 8.5%, 95% CI = - 3.2-4.5, p = 0.739). CONCLUSIONS: Clinically important indicators for STEMI management were unaffected at the peak of COVID-19, suggesting that the pre-existing logistic structure in the regional STEMI networks preserved high-quality standards even when challenged by a threatening pandemic.

Selected critical material attributes were amount of phospholipid (X1), concentration of ethanol (X2), and amount of sodium cholate (X3). The prepared transethosomal vesicles were incorporated into carbopol gel base and evaluated. Ultraviolet radiation-induced skin-aging and oxidative stress model in Swiss Albino mice was used to evaluate the clinical potential of the developed formulation and compared with conventional gel. Levels of SOD, Catalase, Glutathione peroxidase, protein content, and malondialdehyde were measured to assess the extent of lipid peroxidation and reactive oxygen species inhibition in different groupsResult: DoE was successfully employed to optimize the vesicular formulation. Vesicle size was found to be 158.9 ± 7.65 nm, while values of entrapment efficiency and skin deposition were found to be 77.83 ± 2.87% and 371.84 ± 5.12 µg cm-2 respectively. Visual skin grading and histopathological studies confirmed the higher efficacy of transethosomal resveratrol against oxidative stress. Significant enhancement in the levels of antioxidant enzymes and protein content confirmed the ameliorated potential of flexible transethosomal resveratrol as compared to the plain gel of resveratrol.Conclusion: Restoration of first-line defense mechanism in chronic UV exposed animal model has proved that transethosomal resveratrol can be developed as an innovative cosmetic product for significant improvement and repair of photo-aged skin.","Arora, Daisy; Khurana, Bharat; Nanda, Sanju",Drug Dev Ind Pharm,,696

In this article we describe and analyze how resources, cooperation, and innovation have contributed to the accelerated development of COVID-19 vaccines. Similar levels and types of public investment, models of cooperation, and harnessing of innovative processes and technologies could be applied to future epidemics and other global health challenges.","Bloom, David E; Cadarette, Daniel; Ferranna, Maddalena; Hyer, Randall N; Tortorice, Daniel L",Health Aff (Millwood),,696
427762,Combination of serological total antibody and RT-PCR test for detection of SARS-COV-2 infections,2020,"The infectious microscopic viruses invade living cells to reproduce themselves, and causes chronic infections such as HIV/AIDS, hepatitis B and C, flu, etc. in humans which may lead to death if not treated. Different strategies have been utilized to develop new and superior antiviral drugs to counter the viral infections. The FDA approval of HIV nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor, zidovudine in 1987 boosted the development of antiviral agents against different viruses. Currently, there are a number of combination drugs developed against various viral infections to arrest the activity of same or different viral macromolecules at multiple stages of its life cycle; among which majority are targeted to interfere with the replication of viral genome. Besides these, other type of antiviral molecules includes entry inhibitors, integrase inhibitors, protease inhibitors, interferons, immunomodulators, etc. The antiviral drugs can be toxic to human cells, particularly in case of administration of combination drugs, and on the other hand viruses can grow resistant to the antiviral drugs. Furthermore, emergence of new viruses like Ebola, coronaviruses (SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2) emphasizes the need for more innovative strategies to develop better antiviral drugs to fight the existing and the emerging viral infections. Hence, we reviewed the strategic enhancements in developing antiviral drugs for the treatment of different viral infections over the years.","Tompa, Dharma Rao; Immanuel, Aruldoss; Srikanth, Srimari; Kadhirvel, Saraboji",Int J Biol Macromol,,696

430678,Evaluation of the Ion AmpliSeq SARS-CoV-2 Research Panel by Massive Parallel Sequencing,2020,"BACKGROUND: Large scale physical distancing measures and movement restrictions imposed to contain COVID-19, often referred to as 'lockdowns', abruptly and ubiquitously restricted access to routine healthcare services. This study describes reported barriers and coping mechanisms to accessing healthcare among chronic care patients during the nationwide COVID-19 lockdown in Rwanda. METHODS: This cross-sectional study was conducted among chronic care patients enrolled in pediatric development, HIV/AIDS, non-communicable diseases, mental health, and oncology programs at 3 rural Rwandan districts. Active patients with an appointment scheduled between March-June 2020 and a phone number recorded in the electronic medical record system were eligible. Data were collected by telephone interviews between 23rd April and 11th May 2020, with proxy reporting by caregivers for children and critically ill-patients. Fisher's exact tests were used to measure associations. Logistic regression analysis was also used to assess factors associated with reporting at least one barrier to accessing healthcare during the lockdown. RESULTS: Of 220 patient respondents, 44% reported at least one barrier to accessing healthcare. Barriers included lack of access to emergency care (n = 50; 22.7%), lack of access to medication (n = 44; 20.0%) and skipping clinical appointments (n = 37; 16.8%). Experiencing barriers was associated with the clinical program (p < 0.001), with oncology patients being highly affected (64.5%), and with increasing distance from home to the health facility (p = 0.031). In the adjusted logistic regression model, reporting at least one barrier to accessing healthcare was associated with the patient's clinical program and district of residence. Forty (18.2%) patients identified positive coping mechanisms to ensure continuation of care, such as walking long distances during suspension of public transport (n = 21; 9.6%), contacting clinicians via telephone for guidance or rescheduling appointments (n = 15; 6.8%), and delegating someone else for medication pick-up (n = 6; 2.7%). Of 124 patients who reported no barriers to accessing healthcare, 9% used positive coping mechanisms. CONCLUSION: A large proportion of chronic care patients experienced barriers to accessing healthcare during the COVID-19 lockdown. However, many patients also independently identified positive coping mechanisms to ensure continuation of care - strategies that could be formally adopted by healthcare systems in Rwanda and similar settings to mitigate effects of future lockdowns on patients.","Nshimyiryo, Alphonse; Barnhart, Dale A; Cubaka, Vincent K; Dusengimana, Jean Marie Vianney; Dusabeyezu, Symaque; Ndagijimana, Deogratias; Umutesi, Grace; Shyirambere, Cyprien; Karema, Nadine; Mubiligi, Joel M; Kateera, Fredrick",BMC Public Health,,696

After its experience with SARS, Taiwan established a comprehensive mechanism at its border to prevent the entry of infectious diseases. However, people with chronic infectious diseases, carriers with no symptoms, and those likely to be infected are not easy to identify during border screenings. Therefore, Taiwan must implement internal disease-containment measures in addition to stopping infectious disease at its borders. With increasing numbers of patients coming to Taiwan for medical examinations, medical aesthetic treatments, and medical treatments and care, the risk of acute, chronic, and contagious diseases originating from non-residents must be considered and addressed. This article was developed to discuss the role and importance of nurses in preventing transnational infectious diseases from the perspective of international medical care. In addition to showing rich nursing experience, sensitivity, and conducting the management and communication of international cases, it is also necessary to make good use of information tools for remote screening care. Taking the period of the COVID-19 outbreak as an example, several procedures have been conducted. First, online detailed history of infectious diseases and nursing evaluations are conducted before admission. Second, preparation and movement notifications are given before admission. Third, online health education and follow-up care as well as cross-unit communication and coordination are implemented. International medical nurses directly affect the quality and effectiveness of international medical treatment. As Taiwan builds up its brand as an international medical caring destination, nursing professionals should help further this trend and announce to the world: Taiwan can help!

431914,"Modeling vaccination rollouts, SARS-CoV-2 variants and the requirement for non-pharmaceutical interventions in Italy",2021,"Background: For the preventive treatment of the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) an unprecedented global research effort studied the safety and efficacy of new vaccine platforms that have not been previously used in humans. Less than one year after the discovery of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) viral sequence, these vaccines were approved for use in the European Union (EU) as well as in numerous other countries and mass vaccination efforts began. The so far in the EU approved mRNA vaccines BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273 are based on similar lipid-based nanoparticle carrier technologies; however, the lipid components differ. Severe allergic reactions and anaphylaxis after COVID-19 vaccination are very rare adverse events but have drawn attention due to potentially lethal outcomes and have triggered a high degree of uncertainty. Methods: Current knowledge on anaphylactic reactions to vaccines and specifically the new mRNA COVID-19 vaccines was compiled using a literature search in Medline, PubMed, as well as the national and international study and guideline registries, the Cochrane Library, and the Internet, with special reference to official websites of the World Health Organization (WHO), US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Robert Koch Institute (RKI), and Paul Ehrlich Institute (PEI). Results: Based on the international literature and previous experience, recommendations for prophylaxis, diagnosis and therapy of these allergic reactions are given by a panel of experts. Conclusion: Allergy testing is not necessary for the vast majority of allergic patients prior to COVID-19 vaccination with currently licensed vaccines. In case of allergic/anaphylactic reactions after vaccination, allergy workup is recommended, as it is for a small potential risk population prior to the first vaccination. Evaluation and approval of diagnostic tests should be done for this purpose.","Klimek, Ludger; Bergmann, Karl-Christian; Brehler, Randolf; Pfützner, Wolfgang; Zuberbier, Torsten; Hartmann, Karin; Jakob, Thilo; Novak, Natalija; Ring, Johannes; Merk, Hans; Hamelmann, Eckard; Ankermann, Tobias; Schmidt, Sebastian; Untersmayr, Eva; Hötzenecker, Wolfram; Jensen-Jarolim, Erika; Brockow, Knut; Mahler, Vera; Worm, Margitta",Allergo J Int,,696
432020,Rapid SARS-CoV-2 testing in primary material based on a novel multiplex RT-LAMP assay,2020,"Starting in June 2020—three months after the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic—a series of interviews were started with representatives of large firms operating in Canada to address two primary questions: (1) How have corporations in Canada supported COVID-19 response efforts? (2) Will the COVID-19 pandemic result in increased responsibilities for, and societal expectations of, corporations? In response to the first query, it is concluded that many large firms have been successfully leveraging existing CSR programs to support COVID-19 response efforts. The companies assessed in this study are not indicative of corporate COVID-19 responses across Canada;however, the participants serve to demonstrate best practices for supporting pandemic relief and response efforts in tandem with continued operations. In response to the second query, it is concluded that the COVID-19 pandemic has created increased pressures for corporations within Canada to leverage their resources to advance and protect societal interests. Most notably, some industry leaders have recognized increasing requirements to maintain their social licence to operate and are thus seeking to expand CSR programs in a time of financial uncertainty brought about by the pandemic. As many civil society organizations continue to experience financial and operational pressures due to COVID-19, there is significant pressure on corporations to bolster their community advancement initiatives.

434221,SARS-CoV-2 detection and genomic sequencing from hospital surface samples collected at UC Davis,2021,"Widespread uptake of the COVID-19 vaccine is critical to halt the pandemic. At present, little is known about factors that will affect vaccine uptake, especially among diverse racial/ethnic communities that have experienced the highest burden of COVID. We administered an online survey to a Qualtrics respondent panel of women ages 27-45 years (N = 396) to assess vaccine intentions and attitudes, and trusted vaccine information sources. 56.8% intended to be vaccinated and 25.5% were unsure. In bivariate analyses, a greater percentage of non-Latina White (NLW) and Chinese women reported that they would be vaccinated, compared with Latina and non-Latina Black (NLB) women (p < 0.001). Those who were uninsured, unemployed and those with lower incomes were less likely to say that they would be vaccinated. In analyses stratified by race/ethnicity, NLB women remained significantly less likely to report that they would be vaccinated compared with NLW women (adjusted odds ratio: 0.47; 95% confidence interval: 0.23, 0.94), controlling for age, marital status, income, education, employment, and insurance status. When analyses were additionally controlled for beliefs in vaccine safety and efficacy, racial/ethnic differences were no longer significant (adjusted odds ratio: 0.64; 95% confidence interval: 0.31, 1.34). Given that NLB women were less likely to report the intention to be vaccinated, targeted efforts will be needed to promote vaccine uptake. It will be critical to emphasize that the vaccine is safe and effective; this message may be best delivered by trusted community members.","Allen, Jennifer D; Abuelezam, Nadia N; Rose, Rebecca; Fontenot, Holly B",Transl Behav Med,,696

Methods: A multicentric study was performed in 480 hospitalized patients with COVID-19. Clinical and biochemical characteristics were evaluated in patients with admission hyperglycaemia and compared with non-hyperglycaemic patients. The effect of diabetes and admission hyperglycaemia on severity and risk of death were evaluated. Results: Age was 50.7 ± 13.6 years; 68.3% were male. Some 48.5% (n = 233) had admission hyperglycaemia; 29% (n = 139) of these patients had pre-existing diabetes. Patients with admission hyperglycaemia had more requirement of invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV), higher levels of urea, D-dimer and neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), as well as lower lymphocyte count.

441892,SiO2-Ag Composite as a Highly Virucidal Material: A Roadmap that Rapidly Eliminates SARS-CoV-2,2021,"BackgroundTo better understand sexual and reproductive health (SRH) during the initial COVID-19 wave, we organized a multi-country cross-sectional survey. MethodsConsortium research teams conducted online surveys in 30 countries. Primary outcomes included sexual behaviors, partner violence, and SRH service utilization, and we compared three months prior to and three months after policy measures to mitigate COVID-19. We used established indicators and analyses pre-specified in our protocol. We conducted meta-analyses for primary outcomes and graded the certainty of the evidence using Cochrane methods. FindingsDescriptive analyses included 22,724 individuals in 25 countries. Five additional countries with sample sizes <200 were included in descriptive meta-analyses. Respondents were mean age 34 years; most identified as women (15160; 66.7%), cis-gender (19432; 86.6%) and heterosexual (16592; 77.9%). Among 4546 respondents with casual partners, condom use stayed steady for 3374 (74.4%); 640 (14.1%) reported a decline. Fewer respondents reported physical or sexual partner violence during COVID-19 measures (1063/15144, 7.0%) than before (1469/15887, 9.3%). COVID-19 measures impeded access to condoms (933/10790, 8.7%), contraceptives (610/8175, 7.5%), and HIV/STI testing (750/1965, 30.7%). Pooled estimates from meta-analysis indicate during COVID-19 measures, 32.3% (95% CI 23.9-42.1) of people needing HIV/STI testing had hindered access, 4.4% (95% CI 3.4-5.4) experienced partner violence, and 5.8% (95% CI 5.4-8.2) decreased casual partner condom use (moderate certainty of evidence for each outcome). Meta-analysis findings were robust in sensitivity analyses that examined country income level, sample size, and sampling strategy. InterpretationThe initial COVID-19 wave impacted SRH behaviors and access to services across diverse global settings. FundingUnited States National Institutes of Health, Latvia National Research Programme to Lessen the Effects of COVID-19 Research in context Evidence before this studyIn 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic forced billions of people to shelter in place, altering social and sexual relationships worldwide. In many settings, COVID-19 undercut already precarious health infrastructure and health service provision. However, there is limited evidence to date about changes to sexual and reproductive health (SRH) during the initial wave of SARS-CoV-2 infections (COVID-19 disease). Most studies have focused on high-income countries, rather than examining broader regional and global trends. To address this gap, our team organized a multi-country, cross-sectional online survey as part of a global consortium. Consortium research teams in 30 low, middle, and high-income countries collaboratively developed the survey instrument using existing measures and items adapted for COVID-19. Topics included sociodemographic characteristics; compliance with COVID-19 mitigation measures; couple and family relationships; sexual behavior; contraceptive use and barriers to access; access to reproductive healthcare; abortion; sexual violence and intimate partner violence (IPV); HIV/STI testing and treatment; and optional sections including female genital cutting and early marriage; mental health; and food insecurity. This multi-country, cross-sectional study aimed to better understand SRH prior to and during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in participating countries. Added value of this studyThis study was conducted in thirty diverse settings during a pandemic. In addition to providing needed evidence about SRH during COVID-19 across low-, middle-, and high-income countries, the study demonstrates the feasibility and utility of a new framework for global health collaboration. Using an inclusive open science approach, we were able to harmonize key sexual health variables across countries. Our use of online data collection and large reliance on convenience sampling provides both challenges and opportunities. Implications of all the available evidenceThis multi-country study provides detailed sexual and behavioral data across diverse global settings. Our findings suggest that COVID-19 measures during the initial wave of the COVID-19 pandemic impacted sexual and reproductive health behaviors and access to services worldwide. In particular, our findings show a sizable proportion of people needing SRH services including HIV/STI testing and abortion reported that their access to these services was limited due to COVID-19 measures. These results suggest the need for expanded use of decentralized SRH interventions that can be implemented in emergency settings, such as self-testing, self-collection, and telemedicine.","Erausquin, Jennifer Toller; Tan, Rayner K.J.; Uhlich, Maximiliane; Francis, Joel M.; Kumar, Navin; Campbell, Linda; Zhang, Wei-Hong; Hlatshwako, Takhona G.; Kosana, Priya; Shah, Sonam; Brenner, Erica M.; Remmerie, Lore; Mussa, Aamirah; Klapilova, Katerina; Mark, Kristen; Perotta, Gabriela; Gabster, Amanda; Wouters, Edwin; Burns, Sharyn; Hendriks, Jacqueline; Hensel, Devon J.; Shamu, Simukai; Strizzi, Jenna Marie; Esho, Tammary; Morroni, Chelsea; Eleuteri, Stefano; Sahril, Norhafiza; Low, Wah Yun; Plasilova, Leona; Lazdane, Gunta; Olumide, Adesola; Michielsen, Kristien; Moreau, Caroline; Tucker, Joseph D; consortium, - I-SHARE research",,,696

All individuals, especially children, are exposed to various viruses including human coronavirus (CoVs) that can generally lead to respiratory infections. We hypothesize that recurrent CoVs exposure may induce an effective antiviral B and T-cell-mediated adaptive immune response, which could also be protective against COVID-19. Based on the high-homology between the Spike protein epitopes of taxonomically-related coronaviruses, we theorize that past/recurrent contact with CoVs might shield children also against the circulating COVID-19 through a possible neutralizing antibody response previously CoVs-induced. This would open up possible lines of research for the development of live-attenuated virus vaccines from CoVs. Future research is desirable to confirm or disprove such hypothesis.","Sposato, Bruno; Scalese, Marco",Med Hypotheses,,696

In this paper, written with didactic intent, we discuss in detail the basic ideas, however giving some hints of how real life complications, like (uncertain) efficiencies and possible background and systematics, can be included in the analysis, as well as the possibility that the ratio of rates might depend on some physical quantity. The simple models considered in this paper allow to obtain, under reasonable assumptions, closed expressions for the rates and their ratios. Monte Carlo methods are also used, both to cross check the exact results and to evaluate by sampling the ratios of counts in the cases in which large number approximation does not hold. In particular it is shown how to make approximate inferences using a Markov Chain Monte Carlo using JAGS/rjags. Some examples of R and JAGS code are provided.","D'Agostini, Giulio",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.04455v1.pdf,696

446830,Persistence of Functional Memory B Cells Recognizing SARS-CoV-2 Variants Despite Loss of Specific IgG (preprint),2021,"A rapid outbreak of novel coronavirus, coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19), has made it a global pandemic. This study focused on the possible association between lymphopenia and computed tomography (CT) scan features and COVID-19 patient mortality. The clinical data of 596 COVID-19 patients were collected from February 2020 to September 2020. The patients' serological survey and CT scan features were retrospectively explored. The median age of the patients was 56.7 ± 16.4 years old. Lung involvement was more than 50% in 214 COVID-19 patients (35.9%). The average blood lymphocyte percentage was 20.35 ± 10.16 (normal range, 20%-50%). Although the levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) were high in more than 80% of COVID-19 patients; CRP, ESR, and platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR) may not indicate the in-hospital mortality of COVID-19. Patients with severe lung involvement and lymphopenia were found to be significantly associated with increased odds of death (odds ratio, 9.24; 95% confidence interval, 4.32-19.78). These results indicated that lymphopenia < 20% along with pulmonary involvement >50% impose a multiplicative effect on the risk of mortality. The in-hospital mortality rate of this group was significantly higher than other COVID-19 hospitalized cases. Furthermore, they meaningfully experienced a prolonged stay in the hospital (p = .00). Lymphocyte count less than 20% and chest CT scan findings with more than 50% involvement might be related to the patient's mortality. These could act as laboratory and clinical indicators of disease severity, mortality, and outcome.","Zaboli, Ehsan; Majidi, Hadi; Alizadeh-Navaei, Reza; Hedayatizadeh-Omran, Akbar; Asgarian-Omran, Hossein; Vahedi Larijani, Laleh; Khodaverdi, Vahid; Amjadi, Omolbanin",J Med Virol,,696

During a Nipah outbreak in Kerala, India in 2019, it was confined to a single case. The authors were involved in the in-hospital contact tracing. With a single patient producing a contact list of 98 in a healthcare setting, the implications in a community setting during a pandemic of the scale of COVID-19 are huge but it proves that early and rigorous tracing with quarantining is an effective strategy to limit clusters. We believe that if the public is encouraged to maintain their own contact list on a daily basis, it would help in significantly reducing the time and effort invested into contact tracing in the event of a person contracting COVID-19.","Wilson, Arun; Warrier, Anup; Rathish, Balram",Trop Doct,,696

Such apps can now be downloaded in many countries, but as second waves of COVID-19 are raging, these apps are playing a less important role than anticipated. We argue that this is because most countries have opted for app configurations that cannot provide a means of rapidly informing users of likely infections while avoiding too many false positive reports. Mathematical modelling suggests that differently configured apps have the potential to do this. These require, however, that some pseudonymised data be stored on a central server, which privacy advocates have cautioned against. We contend that their influential arguments are subject to two fallacies. First, they have tended to one-sidedly focus on the risks that centralised data storage entails for privacy, while paying insufficient attention to the fact that inefficient contact tracing involves ethical risks too. Second, while the envisioned system does entail risks of breaches, such risks are also present in decentralised systems, which have been falsely presented as 'privacy preserving by design'. When these points are understood, it becomes clear that we must rethink our approach to digital contact tracing in our fight against COVID-19.","White, Lucie; van Basshuysen, Philippe",J. med. ethics,,696
455531,Quantitative and Ultrasensitive In-situ Immunoassay Technology for SARS-CoV-2 Detection in Saliva,2021,"During the COVID-19 lockdown in the US, many businesses were shut down temporarily. Essential businesses, most prominently grocery stores, remained open to ensure access to food and household essentials. Grocery shopping presents increased potential for COVID-19 infection because customers and store employees are in proximity to each other. This study investigated shoppers' perceptions of COVID-19 infection risks and put them in context by comparing grocery shopping to other activities outside home, and examined whether a proactive preventive action by grocery stores influence shoppers' perceived risk of COVID-19 infection. Our data were obtained via an anonymous online survey distributed between April 2 and 10, 2020 to grocery shoppers in New York State (the most affected by the pandemic at the time of the study) and Washington State (the first affected by the pandemic). We found significant factors associated with high levels of risk perception on grocery shoppers. We identified some effective preventive actions that grocery stores implement to alleviate anxiety and risk perception. We found that people are generally more concerned about in-store grocery shopping relative to other out-of-home activities. Findings suggest that a strict policy requiring grocery store employees to use facemasks and gloves greatly reduced shoppers' perceived risk rating of infection of themselves by 37.5% and store employees by 51.2%. Preventive actions by customers and businesses are critical to reducing the unwitting transmission of COVID-19 as state governments prepare to reopen the economy and relax restrictions on activities outside home.","Li, Jie; Verteramo Chiu, Leslie J; Gómez, Miguel I; Bills, Nelson L",PLoS One,,696

Background: The COVID-19 pandemic had a delayed onset in America. Despite the time advantage for the implementation of preventative measures to contain its spread, the pandemic followed growth rates that paralleled those observed before in Europe. Objectives: To analyze the temporal and geographical distribution of the COVID-19 pandemic at district-level in Perú during the full lockdown period in 2020. Methods: Analysis of publicly available data sets, stratified by altitude and geographical localization. Correlation tests of COVID-19 case and death rates to population prevalence of comorbidities. Results: We observe a strong protective effect of altitude from COVID-19 mortality in populations located above 2,500 m. We provide evidence that internal migration through a specific land route is a significant factor progressively overriding the protection from COVID-19 afforded by high altitude. This protection is independent of poverty indexes and is inversely correlated with the prevalence of hypertension and hypercholesterolemia. Discussion: Long-term adaptation to residency at high altitude may be the third general protective factor from COVID-19 severity and death, after young age and female sex. Multisystemic adaptive traits or acclimatization processes in response to chronic hypobaric hypoxia may explain the apparent protective effect of high altitude from COVID-19 death.","Thomson, Timothy M; Casas, Fresia; Guerrero, Harold Andre; Figueroa-Mujíca, Rómulo; Villafuerte, Francisco C; Machicado, Claudia",High altitude medicine &amp; biology (Online),,696

However, Heinsberg was not included as an area reporting local or community transmission per the national case definition at the time. In early March, two residents from a long-term care facility (LTCF) in Sittard, a Dutch town located in close vicinity to the district of Heinsberg, tested positive for COVID-19. In this study we aimed to determine whether cross-border introduction of the virus took place by analysing the LTCF outbreak in Sittard, both epidemiologically and microbiologically. METHODS: Surveys and semi-structured oral interviews were conducted with all present LTCF residents by health care workers during regular points of care for information on new or unusual signs and symptoms of disease. Both throat and nasopharyngeal swabs were taken from residents suspect of COVID-19, based on regional criteria, for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 by Real-time Polymerase Chain Reaction. Additionally, whole genome sequencing was performed using a SARS-CoV-2 specific amplicon-based Nanopore sequencing approach. Moreover, twelve random residents were sampled for possible asymptomatic infections. RESULTS: Out of 99 residents, 46 got tested for COVID-19.

These groups often benefit from assistive technology (AT) and so it is important to understand how use of AT may be affected by or may help to mitigate the impacts of COVID-19. Objective: The objectives of this study were to explore the how AT use and provision have been affected during the initial stages of the COVID-19 pandemic, and how AT policies and systems may be made more resilient based on lessons learned during this global crisis. METHODS: This study was a rapid, international online qualitative survey in the 6 United Nations (UN) languages (English, French, Spanish, Russian, Arabic, Mandarin Chinese) facilitated by extant World Health Organization (WHO) and International Disability Alliance networks. Themes and subthemes of the qualitative responses were identified using Braun and Clarke's 6-phase analysis. RESULTS: Four primary themes were identified in in the data: Disruption of Services, Insufficient Emergency Preparedness, Limitations in Existing Technology, and Inadequate Policies and Systems. Subthemes were identified within each theme, including subthemes related to developing resilience in AT systems, based on learning from the pandemic. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 has disrupted the delivery of AT services, primarily due to infection control measures resulting in lack of provider availability and diminished one-to-one services. This study identified a need for stronger user-centred development of funding policies and infrastructures that are more sustainable and resilient, best practices for remote service delivery, robust and accessible tools and systems, and increased capacity of clients, caregivers, and clinicians to respond to pandemic and other crisis situations.","Smith, Emma M; Toro Hernandez, Maria Luisa; Ebuenyi, Ikenna D; Syurina, Elena V; Barbareschi, Giulia; Best, Krista L; Danemayer, Jamie; Oldfrey, Ben; Ibrahim, Nuha; Holloway, Catherine; MacLachlan, Malcolm",Int. j. health policy manag,,696

However, no studies have assessed health workers' experiences using qualitative methods during the COVID-19 outbreak in the United States to identify novel factors that could relate to their mental health. In May 2020, we distributed an online survey to health workers across 25 medical centers throughout the United States. The Patient Health Questionnaire-9, Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7, Primary Care-Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder, and Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test-Concise and associated cutoff values were used to assess rates of probable major depression, generalized anxiety disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, and alcohol use disorder, respectively. To provide insight into the factors shaping these and other mental health conditions, we included two open-ended questions asking respondents to recount their most upsetting and hopeful experiences during the COVID-19 pandemic and how it made them feel. Using a hybrid inductive-abductive approach and thematic content analysis, we created a Social Ecological Model to represent themes among health workers' experiences within five ecological levels: individual, interpersonal, organization, community, and public policy. Of the 1,132 participants who completed the survey, 14.0% had probable major depression, 15.8% probable generalized anxiety disorder, 23.1% probable post-traumatic stress disorder, and 42.6% probable alcohol use disorder. Individual level themes included participants' personal health and self-care behaviors. Interpersonal level themes included the health of their social circle, family functioning, and social support. Organization level themes included their hospital's management, resources, patient care, routine, and teams. Themes in the community level included the media, scientific knowledge about COVID-19, morale, behavior, and support of health workers. Lastly, government and health system leadership and shelter-in-place policy were themes within the public policy level. Our findings provide insights into novel factors that have impacted health workers' wellbeing during the COVID-19 pandemic. These factors should be further explored to inform interventions and public policy that mitigate mental health morbidities among health workers during this and future outbreaks.","Hennein, Rachel; Lowe, Sarah",PLoS One,,696

Case presentation: A 36-year-old man with a fever for 3 days fell from the 5th floor and was transported to our emergency department. Pan-scan computed tomography (CT) revealed multiple ground-glass opacities just below the pleura, pelvic fractures, thoracic vertebral fracture (Th11), and right femoral fracture. COVID-19 was ruled out based on negative real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction results on days 2 and 3, and a reduction in the multiple ground-glass opacities on CT carried out on day 5. Until the suspicion of COVID-19 was cleared, strict and standardized processing procedures were implemented in the same way as for a patient with COVID-19.

For such a large-scale epidemic, early detection and isolation of potential virus carriers is essential to curb the spread of the epidemic. Recent studies have shown that one important feature of COVID-19 is the abnormal respiratory status caused by viral infections. During the epidemic, many people tend to wear masks to reduce the risk of getting sick. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a portable non-contact method to screen the health condition of people wearing masks through analysis of the respiratory characteristics. The device mainly consists of a FLIR one thermal camera and an Android phone. This may help identify those potential patients of COVID-19 under practical scenarios such as pre-inspection in schools and hospitals. In this work, we perform the health screening through the combination of the RGB and thermal videos obtained from the dual-mode camera and deep learning architecture.We first accomplish a respiratory data capture technique for people wearing masks by using face recognition. Then, a bidirectional GRU neural network with attention mechanism is applied to the respiratory data to obtain the health screening result. The results of validation experiments show that our model can identify the health status on respiratory with the accuracy of 83.7\% on the real-world dataset. The abnormal respiratory data and part of normal respiratory data are collected from Ruijin Hospital Affiliated to The Shanghai Jiao Tong University Medical School. Other normal respiratory data are obtained from healthy people around our researchers. This work demonstrates that the proposed portable and intelligent health screening device can be used as a pre-scan method for respiratory infections, which may help fight the current COVID-19 epidemic.","Jiang, Zheng; Hu, Menghan; Fan, Lei; Pan, Yaling; Tang, Wei; Zhai, Guangtao; Lu, Yong",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.06912v1.pdf,696

Recently, studies have revealed the involvement of both genetic and exposure factors in the susceptibility of COVID-19. However, the correlation between them is still unclear. Thus, we aimed to investigate the correlation between genetic and exposure factors associated with COVID-19. We retrieved the information of 7362 participants with COVID-19 testing results from the UK Biobank. We identified genetic factors for COVID-19 by genome-wide association studies (GWAS) summary analysis. In this study, 21 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and 15 exposure factors [smoking, alcohol intake, daytime dozing, body mass index (BMI), triglyceride, High Density Lipoprotein (HDL), diabetes, chronic kidney disease, chronic liver disease, dementia, atmosphere NO2 concentration, socioeconomic status, education qualification, ethnicity, and income] were found to be potential risk factors of COVID-19. Then, a gene-exposure (Gâ¯×â¯E) association network was built based on the correlation among and between these genetic factors and exposure factors. rs140092351, a SNP on microRNA miR1202, not only had the most significant association with COVID-19, but also interacted with multiple exposure factors.

496859,Introduction of SARS-CoV-2 variant of concern 20h/501Y.V2 (B.1.351) from Malawi to Italy,2021,"BACKGROUND: Evaluate the association between hyperglycemia and outcomes in patients with COVID-19 admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). METHODS: We conducted a multi-center retrospective study involving all adults with COVID-19 admitted to the ICU between March and May 2020. Patients were divided into normoglycemic (average blood glucose < 140 mg/dL) and hyperglycemic (average blood glucose > 140 mg/dL) groups. Outcomes such as mortality, need and duration of mechanical ventilation, and length of hospital and ICU stays were measured. RESULTS: Among 495 patients, 58.4% were male with a median age of 68 years (IQR: 58.00-77.00), and baseline average blood glucose was 186.6 (SD+130.8). Pre-existing diabetes was present in 35.8% of the studied cohort. Combined ICU and hospital mortality rates were 23.8%; mortality rate and mechanical ventilation were significantly higher in the hyperglycemic group (31.4 % vs. 16.6%, p=0.001) and (50.0% vs. 37.2%, p=0.004) respectively. Age above 60 years (HR:3.21 [95% CI 1.78, 5.78]) and hyperglycemia (HR:1.79 [95% CI 1.14, 2.82]) were the only significant predictors of in-hospital mortality. Increased risk for hyperglycemia was found in patients with steroids use (OR:1.521 [95% CI 1.054, 2.194]), triglycerides > 150 mg/dL (OR:1.62 [95% CI 1.109, 2.379]), and African-American race (OR:0.79 [95% CI 0.65, 0.95]). CONCLUSIONS: Hyperglycemia in COVID-19 patients is significantly associated with prolonged ICU length of stay, higher need of mechanical ventilation, and increased risk of mortality in the critical care setting. Tighter blood glucose control (<140 mg/dL) might improve outcomes in COVID-19 critically-ill patients, evidence from ongoing clinical trials is needed. This article is protected by copyright.

498599,The unique evolutionary dynamics of the SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant,2021,"Student satisfaction is the pinnacle upon which any effective online learning hinges. It is for that reason, educators design course activities that allow students to effectively practice, work together on relevant projects to personalize their learning. In emerging institutions like the Colleges of Education in Ghana that are traditionally inclined toward teachers’ professional development through conventional face-to-face interaction, online education became the medium of interaction for the first time to promote social distancing in response to COVID-19 pandemic while enhancing access and continuous professional development of the human resources for the education sector. This basic qualitative study examined the conduct of online teaching in a traditional face-to-face educational system in Ghana. The analysis of the semi-structured interviews revealed that the basic infrastructure for online teaching and learning is absent. Specifically, student trainees are saddled by poor internet connectivity, high cost of data in an emergency remote teaching environment. Due to these challenges, a significant proportion of the participating student-teachers wouldn’t choose online learning for their work and professional development. In view of this, the study recommends policy makers to institutionalize online education into the curricula of all professional institutions of higher education in Ghana. © 2021 ISTE.","Debrah, A.; Yeyie, P.; Gyimah, E.; Halm, G.

COVID-19, which has already become the worst pandemic in the last 100 years, is still spreading worldwide. Since the beginning of the outbreak, it has been of particular interest to understand whether COVID-19 is seasonal; the finding might help for better planning and preparation for the fight against the disease. Over the past 12 months, numerous empirical and epidemiological studies have been performed to define the distinct diffusion patterns of COVID-19. Thereby, a wealth of data has accumulated on the relationship between various seasonal meteorological factors and COVID-19 transmissibility at global and local scales. In this review, we aimed to discuss whether COVID-19 exhibits any seasonal features in a global and local perspective by collecting and providing summaries of the findings from empirical and epidemiological studies on the COVID-19 pandemic during its first seasonal cycle.","Byun, Woo Seok; Heo, Sin Woo; Jo, Gunhee; Kim, Jae Won; Kim, Sarang; Lee, Sujie; Park, Hye Eun; Baek, Jea-Hyun",Environ Res,,696

Here, we tested the inhibitory activities of the antiviral interferons of type I (IFN-alpha) and type III (IFN-lambda) against SARS-CoV-2 and compared them with those against SARS-CoV-1, which emerged in 2003. Using two mammalian epithelial cell lines (human Calu-3 and simian Vero E6), we found that both IFNs dose-dependently inhibit SARS-CoV-2. In contrast, SARS-CoV-1 was restricted only by IFN-alpha in these cell lines. SARS-CoV-2 generally exhibited a broader IFN sensitivity than SARS-CoV-1. Moreover, ruxolitinib, an inhibitor of IFN-triggered Janus kinase (JAK)/signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) signaling, boosted SARS-CoV-2 replication in the IFN-competent Calu-3 cells. We conclude that SARS-CoV-2 is sensitive to exogenously added IFNs. This finding suggests that type I and especially the less adverse effect-prone type III IFN are good candidates for the management of COVID-19.","Felgenhauer, Ulrike; Schoen, Andreas; Gad, Hans Henrik; Hartmann, Rune; Schaubmar, Andreas R; Failing, Klaus; Drosten, Christian; Weber, Friedemann",J. biol. chem,,696

504892,Ética & SARS-CoV-2 – Medidas Restritivas e Distanciamento Físico,2020,"The COVID-19 pandemic is a public health emergency that demands leadership throughout the health care system. Leadership is the ability to guide a team or organization toward a stated goal or objective. In addition to hospital-wide leadership, there is need for leadership at the level of medical teams. Resident leadership is essential to ensure team function and patient care, yet residents are often overlooked as valuable leaders. This Perspective argues that residents can demonstrate leadership during a public health crisis by creating a culture of emotional intelligence in their medical teams. Emotional intelligence has been identified as a critical aspect of leadership and consists of self-awareness, self-management, social awareness, and relationship management. In psychiatry, patient interactions depend upon psychiatrists demonstrating a high level of attention to their own thoughts, feelings, and behaviors as well as those of the patient to communicate in a way that demonstrates both understanding and empathy. In this Perspective, a psychiatry resident uses expertise in emotional intelligence to recommend residents (1) be mindful, (2) ask and listen, (3) establish safety, and (4) unite around a common goal. These practical recommendations can be immediately implemented to increase emotional intelligence on medical teams to improve team function and patient care. Emotional intelligence is valuable at all levels of leadership, so hospital leadership and program directors should also heed these suggestions. While these recommendations are not unique to COVID-19, they are of paramount importance during the pandemic.","Ward, Heather Burrell",Acad Med,,696

This study estimated, from the payer's perspective, the lifetime costs among patients diagnosed with UC according to stage at diagnosis. Methods: This retrospective analysis of the linked Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER)-Medicare database identified patients &#8805;66 years with newly diagnosed UC from 2004-2013. Patients were followed from UC diagnosis to death or last follow-up to estimate lifetime costs. Costs were allocated to 3 phases: diagnosis (&#8804;3 months after diagnosis), terminal (&#8804;3 months before death), and continuation (months between diagnosis and terminal phases). Survival-adjusted lifetime costs (total and major UC-related) were estimated for patients with UC based on stage at diagnosis (stages 0 through IV) and in a subgroup of patients receiving &#8805;1 systemic line of chemotherapy (LOC). Results: The sample included 15,588 patients: 3,446 stage 0 (8% &#8805;1 LOC; median [IQR] follow-up in months: 44 [23-71]); 3,902 stage I (12% &#8805;1 LOC; 33 [15-62]); 4,301 stage II (26% &#8805;1 LOC; 17 [7-39]); 1,612 stage III (25% &#8805;1 LOC; 17 [7-42]); and 2,327 stage IV (33% &#8805;1 LOC; 8 [3-18]). Median age was 78 years and 72% were male. Mean lifetime costs were lowest for stage IV patients (stage 0, $151,626; stage 1, $150,123; stage II, $149,728; stage III, $190,996; stage IV, $117,503). Hospitalizations not involving a cystectomy contributed about half of lifetime costs across all stages. Cystectomy contributed 2-13% of the total lifetime UC costs ($3,356 stage 0; $7,011 stage I; $11,855 stage II; $25,509 stage III; $11,693 stage IV). UC-related office visits contributed 8-15% of lifetime costs ($11,717 stage 0; $14,611 stage I; $19,882 stage II; $21,480 stage III; $17,820 stage IV). Conclusion: UC continues to be a costly cancer with stage III patients having highest lifetime costs. Hospitalizations drive most of the lifetime costs across all stages; most of these hospitalizations did not involve costs related to cystectomy. Treatment plans requiring shorter and fewer hospitalizations may lessen the economic burden of UC.","Aly, Abdalla; Johnson, Courtney; Doleh, Yunes; Chirikov, Viktor; Botteman, Marc; Shenolikar, Rahul; Hussain, Arif",J Clin Pathw,,696
509403,Controlling simulated outbreaks of new SARS-CoV-2 variants,2021-09-23,"Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine are now being widely used for treatment of COVID-19. Both medications prolong the QT interval and accordingly may put patients at increased risk for torsades de pointes and sudden death. Published guidance documents vary in their recommendations for monitoring and managing these potential adverse effects. Accordingly, we set out to conduct a systematic review of the arrhythmogenic effect of short courses of chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine. We searched on MEDLINE and Embase, as well as in the gray literature up to April 17, 2020, for the risk of QT prolongation, torsades, ventricular arrhythmia, and sudden death with short-term chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine usage. This search resulted in 390 unique records, of which 41 were ultimately selected for qualitative synthesis and which included data on 1515 COVID-19 patients. Approximately 10% of COVID-19 patients treated with these drugs developed QT prolongation. We found evidence of ventricular arrhythmia in 2 COVID-19 patients from a group of 28 treated with high-dose chloroquine. Limitations of these results are unclear follow-up and possible publication/reporting bias, but there is compelling evidence that chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine induce significant QT-interval prolongation and potentially increase the risk of arrhythmia. Daily electrocardiographic monitoring and other risk mitigation strategies should be considered in order to prevent possible harms from what is currently an unproven therapy.","Jankelson, Lior; Karam, Giorgio; Becker, Matthijs L; Chinitz, Larry A; Tsai, Meng-Chiao",Heart Rhythm,,696

512240,Detecting SARS-CoV-2 variants with SNP genotyping,2021,"BACKGROUND: The present study was set up to evaluate the efficacy of virological surveillance using posterior oropharyngeal saliva samples to monitor the COVID-19 pandemic in general practice. METHODS: Posterior oropharyngeal saliva samples were collected without restriction on timing or alimentation by general practitioners from patients with acute respiratory infection (ARI) seen in consultation. Saliva samples were tested by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction for SARS-CoV-2 and 21 other respiratory pathogens. Results for SARS-CoV-2 in saliva samples were compared to results obtained using a nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) collected in a certified medical laboratory before or after the ARI consultation. RESULTS: Overall, 143 ARI patients were enrolled between 6 June 2020, and 19 January 2021. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in 37.0% (n = 53) of saliva samples and in 39.0% (n = 56) of NPS. Both saliva and NPS were positive in 51 patients. Positive and negative results were concordant between saliva samples and NPS in 51 (96.2%) and in 85 (94.4%) patients, respectively, with a Cohen's Kappa coefficient of 0.89 (95% CI 0.82-0.97, p < 0.001). Other respiratory viruses were detected in 28.0% (n = 40) of the 143 saliva samples. CONCLUSIONS: Findings suggest that saliva samples could represent an attractive alternative to NPS for surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 in patients consulting for an ARI in primary care.","Masse, Shirley; Bonnet, Camille; Vilcu, Ana-Maria; Benamar, Hayat; Swital, Morgane; van der Werf, Sylvie; Carrat, Fabrice; Hanslik, Thomas; Blanchon, Thierry; Falchi, Alessandra",Viruses,,696
512443,The Emergence of SARS-CoV-2 Variant Lambda (C.37) in South America,2021,"This introduction demonstrates the critical place of rage in our contemporary moment in the face of the catastrophic COVID-19 pandemic, the surge of protests against police killings and the global Movement for Black Lives, and ongoing dissent against rising authoritarianisms around the world. In her overview of the special issue, Carla Kaplan explores the rich tradition of feminist scholarship on rage from Audre Lorde to Adrienne Rich. Kaplan reflects on the essential work of Signs in this moment as a critical space for engaged feminist public scholarship in a time of protest and crisis. Sarah Haley traces how Black feminist theories of rage have been foundational to broad feminist critiques of state violence and visions for a sustainable, livable world. Yet, Haley argues, Black feminisms are too often treated as a ""commodity fetish,"" appearing primarily as a citation rather than as a subject of extended engagement and analysis. Durba Mitra analyzes how feminist protest defines our contemporary moment, with no single origin and no end in sight. Mitra highlights the diverse modes of feminist outrage in global protests, from singing and dancing to art making, through the example of the Shaheen Bagh protests against anti-Muslim laws in India. The final section highlights the wide-ranging feminist themes linked to rage in the issue: protests in Puerto Rico, trans politics, intersex protest, sex work, carcerality, the question of white womanhood, white women's gun ownership, disability, transnational #feminisms against sexual violence and femicide in Kenya and South Africa, Black girlhood, Indigenous feminisms, and disobedient humor in the age of Trump.

In this work, we present two new contributions to this topic. First, we investigate the velocity distribution and the temperature-kinetic energy relationship associated with the isokinetic Nosé-Hoover family of methods, showing how they depend on the number of thermostats attached to each atomic degree of freedom. Second, we investigate the performance of these methods in the calculation of solvation free energies, the determination of which is often key for understanding the partition of a chemical species among distinct environments. We show how one can extract this property from canonical (constant-NVT) simulations and compare the result to experimental data obtained at a specific pressure. Finally, we demonstrate that large time steps can, in fact, be used to improve the efficiency of these calculations and that attaching multiple thermostats per degree of freedom is beneficial for effectively exploring the configurational space of a molecular system.","Abreu, Charlles R A; Tuckerman, Mark E",J. chem. theory comput.

However, most of the existing NER benchmarks lack domain-specialized entity types or do not focus on a certain domain, leading to a less effective cross-domain evaluation. To address these obstacles, we introduce a cross-domain NER dataset (CrossNER), a fully-labeled collection of NER data spanning over five diverse domains with specialized entity categories for different domains. Additionally, we also provide a domain-related corpus since using it to continue pre-training language models (domain-adaptive pre-training) is effective for the domain adaptation. We then conduct comprehensive experiments to explore the effectiveness of leveraging different levels of the domain corpus and pre-training strategies to do domain-adaptive pre-training for the cross-domain task. Results show that focusing on the fractional corpus containing domain-specialized entities and utilizing a more challenging pre-training strategy in domain-adaptive pre-training are beneficial for the NER domain adaptation, and our proposed method can consistently outperform existing cross-domain NER baselines. Nevertheless, experiments also illustrate the challenge of this cross-domain NER task. We hope that our dataset and baselines will catalyze research in the NER domain adaptation area. The code and data are available at https://github.com/zliucr/CrossNER.","Liu, Zihan; Xu, Yan; Yu, Tiezheng; Dai, Wenliang; Ji, Ziwei; Cahyawijaya, Samuel; Madotto, Andrea; Fung, Pascale",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.04373v2.pdf,696

PATIENTS AND METHODS: This is a combined study including a descriptive part about the changes in the daily work routine of an Interdisciplinary Endoscopic Unit (IEU) and a prospective analysis of patients tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 who required endoscopic interventions. Conclusively, we present the finding of a point-prevalence analysis in the staff of the IEU. RESULTS: We present effects of the COVID-19-related restructuring of processes in our interdisciplinary endoscopy unit (IEU) with respect to cancelation of examinations, relocation of staff to other departments, impact of SARS-CoV-2 on medical staff of the IEU, and supply of protective clothing. Additionally, we analyzed the cohort of COVID-19 patients: Sixteen endoscopic interventions were done in ten patients. In all patients with confirmed infection with SARS-CoV-2, emergency endoscopies were required for relevant bleeding situations. Re-endoscopies were required only in critically ill COVID-19 patients. CONCLUSIONS: The restructuring of processes in the IEU was feasible in short time, effective, and can also be applied broadly at least in developed countries [Garbe et al. in Gastroenterology 159:778-780, 2020; Repici A, Pace F, Gabbiadini R, Colombo M, Hassan C, Dinelli M, Group IG-CW, Maselli R, Spadaccini M, Mutignani M, Gabbrielli A, Signorelli C, Spada C, Leoni P, Fabbri C, Segato S, Gaffuri N, Mangiavillano B, Radaelli F, Salerno R, Bargiggia S, Maroni L, Benedetti A, Occhipinti P, De Grazia F, Ferraris L, Cengia G, Greco S, Alvisi C, Scarcelli A, De Luca L, Cereatti F, Testoni PA, Mingotto R, Aragona G, Manes G, Beretta P, Amvrosiadis G, Cennamo V, Lella F, Missale G, Lagoussis P, Triossi O, Giovanardi M, De Roberto G, Cantu P, Buscarini E, Anderloni A, Carrara S, Fugazza A, Galtieri PA, Pellegatta G, Antonelli G, Rosch T, Sharma P (2020) Endoscopy units and the COVID-19 Outbreak: a Multi-Center Experience from Italy.

524077,SARS-CoV-2 mutations among minks show reduced lethality and infectivity to humans,2021,"Tunneling nanotubes (TNTs) emerged as important specialized actin-rich membrane protrusions for cell-to-cell communication. These structures allow the intercellular exchange of material, such as ions, soluble proteins, receptors, vesicles and organelles, therefore exerting critical roles in normal cell function. Indeed, TNTs participate in a number of physiological processes, including embryogenesis, immune response, and osteoclastogenesis. TNTs have been also shown to contribute to the transmission of retroviruses (e.g., human immunodeficiency virus-1, HIV-1) and coronaviruses. As with other membrane protrusions, the involvement of Rho GTPases in the formation of these elongated structures is undisputable, although the mechanisms involved are not yet fully elucidated. The tight control of Rho GTPase function by guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) and GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs) strongly suggests that localized control of these Rho regulators may contribute to TNT assembly and disassembly. Deciphering the intricacies of the complex signaling mechanisms leading to actin reorganization and TNT development would reveal important information about their involvement in normal cellular physiology as well as unveil potential targets for disease management.","Zhang, Suli; Kazanietz, Marcelo G; Cooke, Mariana",Am J Physiol Cell Physiol,,696

BACKGROUND: Violence against nurses is a common problem that persists worldwide. DESIGN: This was a descriptive cross‐sectional study. METHODS: An online questionnaire form and the Nursing Professional Commitment Scale were used to collect the data. The study was carried out online during the COVID‐19 pandemic between October–December 2020. A total of 263 nurses agreed to participate in the study. The STROBE checklist was followed for observational studies. RESULTS: During the COVID‐19 pandemic, 8.4% of the nurses stated that they were exposed to physical violence, 57.8% to verbal violence, 0.8% to sexual violence and 61.6% to mobbing. 52.1% of the nurses stated that they thought of quitting the profession during the COVID‐19 pandemic. The mean total Nursing Professional Commitment Scale score was 71.33 ± 15.05. CONCLUSIONS: This study revealed that nurses' exposure to physical, verbal and sexual violence during the COVID‐19 pandemic decreased compared to before the pandemic. Nurses' exposure to mobbing during the pandemic was found to increase. A statistically significant difference was found between the status of the nurses' exposure to physical violence, verbal violence, and mobbing, working hours, number of patients given care, and their thoughts of quitting the profession. It was found that the status of exposure to physical violence, thinking of quitting the profession and working hours decreased professional commitment. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: In the light of these results, it is recommended that measures to prevent violence should be addressed in a multifaceted way. In managing the pandemic process, the decisions and practices should not be left to the managers' initiative to prevent mobbing. Initiatives that will increase nurses' professional commitment during the pandemic process should be planned and implemented.","Özkan Şat, Sultan; Akbaş, Pınar; Yaman Sözbir, Şengül",J Clin Nurs,https://doi.org/10.1111/jocn.15760; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33761158/,696

Effective and appropriate immune responses capable of controlling viral infection while also largely preserving tissue integrity, are critical for host survival. Too strong immune responses might result in immune pathology, while too weak immune responses might cause viral persistence. Physiologic ageing is accompanied with a decline in the normal functioning of the immune system, which is termed as ""immunosenescence"". We show that aged mice (16-19 months old) are more resistant to influenza A virus (IAV) infection than the young mice. Strong immune responses in the young mice after IAV infection result in faster clearance of virus, but also cause severe lung injury and higher mortality rate. While in the aged mice, the delayed and milder immune responses contribute to reduced pulmonary damage, and are still capable to clear the infection even with a slower kinetics, displaying a more resistant phenotype during IAV infection. Hence, our work demonstrates that moderate immune responses as a decline with ageing in the aged mice balance the immune pathology and viral clearance, might be beneficial for the host during certain circumstances. Our results provide important insight to our basic knowledge of immunosenescence and immune defenses to invading pathogens. Further, our results indicate that age factors should be considered when investigating the vaccination and therapeutic strategies for severe IAV infection.","Lu, Jiao; Duan, Xuefeng; Zhao, Wenming; Wang, Jing; Wang, Haoyu; Zhou, Kai; Fang, Min",Aging Dis,https://doi.org/10.14336/ad.2017.0701; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29896425/,696

Unprecedented public health actions were introduced, including social distancing, travel restrictions and quarantine. The Belgian government announced a national emergency plan, thereby postponing all non-urgent medical consultations and operations. This report analyses the impact of these measures on cancer screening, through assessment of the workload of a laboratory for histopathology and cytopathology. METHODS: Data on monthly numbers of histological and cytological samples, immunohistochemistry and molecular tests were extracted from the laboratory information management system. RESULTS: The global histopathological and cytological workload was substantially reduced. The impact on oncology-related surgical procedures was rather limited. The anti-COVID-19 measures significantly diminished all screening-related samples, such as colon biopsies, breast biopsies and cervical cytology, and strongly reduced the number of samples related to “functional” pathology, such as thyroidectomies and gastric biopsies. CONCLUSIONS: Since many health care interventions are reflected in the workload of a pathology laboratory, this study enabled us to identify areas for “deconfinement” health care actions. Our findings indicate that various areas in medicine were affected, but the impact seemed largest for cancer screening.

Ten studies fulfilled the defined selection criteria and evaluated the salivary IgA (sIgA) level in DS patients with dental caries. Five articles were further analyzed in a quantitative synthesis presented in the meta-analysis. Due to a modified lifestyle and compromised oral hygiene in DS patients, understandably, it is still postulated in the literature that the presence of sIgA can have a protective effect on the occurrence of dental caries as compared with healthy counterparts. As indicated by the present meta-analysis, no conclusions can be drawn as to definitively label sIgA as a biomarker for dental caries.

Efficient sequencing strategies enable the retrieval of increasing numbers of high-quality, full-length genomes and are, hence, indispensable. Two opposed enrichment methods, tiling multiplex PCR and sequence hybridization by bait capture, have been established for SARS-CoV-2 sequencing and are both frequently used, depending on the quality of the patient sample and the question at hand. Here, we focused on the evaluation of the sequence hybridization method by studying five commercially available sequence capture bait panels with regard to sensitivity and capture efficiency. We discovered the SARS-CoV-2-specific panel of Twist Bioscience to be the most efficient panel, followed by two respiratory panels from Twist Bioscience and Illumina, respectively. Our results provide on the one hand a decision basis for the sequencing community including a computation for using the full capacity of the flow cell and on the other hand potential improvements for the manufacturers. IMPORTANCE Sequencing the genomes of the circulating SARS-CoV-2 strains is the only way to monitor the viral spread and evolution of the virus. Two different approaches, namely, tiling multiplex PCR and sequence hybridization by bait capture, are commonly used to fulfill this task. This study describes for the first time a combined approach of droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) and NGS to evaluate five commercially available sequence capture panels targeting SARS-CoV-2. In doing so, we were able to determine the most sensitive and efficient capture panel, distinguish the mode of action of the various bait panels, and compute the number of read pairs needed to recover a high-quality full-length genome. By calculating the minimum number of read pairs needed, we are providing optimized flow cell loading conditions for all sequencing laboratories worldwide that are striving for maximizing sequencing output and simultaneously minimizing time, costs, and sequencing resources.","Rehn, Alexandra; Braun, Peter; Knüpfer, Mandy; Wölfel, Roman; Antwerpen, Markus H.; Walter, Mathias C.",mSystems,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34342536/; https://doi.org/10.1128/msystems.00392-21,696

METHODS: This nationwide retrospective cohort study describes patients with prior lung disease hospitalised for COVID-19 (March-April 2020) or influenza (2018–2019 influenza outbreak). We compare the resulting pulmonary complications, need for intensive care and in-hospital mortality depending on respiratory history and virus. RESULTS: In the 89 530 COVID-19 cases, 16.03% had at least one CRD, which was significantly less frequently than in the 45 819 seasonal influenza patients. Patients suffering from chronic respiratory failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, cystic fibrosis and pulmonary hypertension were underrepresented, contrary to those with lung cancer, sleep apnea, emphysema, and interstitial pulmonary diseases (ILD). COVID-19 patients with CRD developed significantly more ventilator-associated pneumonia and pulmonary embolism than influenza patients. They needed intensive care significantly more often and had a higher mortality rate (except for asthma) when compared to patients with COVID-19 but without CRD, or patients with influenza. CONCLUSION: Patients with prior respiratory diseases were globally less likely to be hospitalised for COVID-19 than for influenza but were at higher risk of developing severe COVID-19 and had a higher mortality rate compared to influenza patients and patients without a history of respiratory illness. Our data suggest that these patients should have priority access to SARS-CoV2 vaccination.","Beltramo, Guillaume; Cottenet, Jonathan; Mariet, Anne-Sophie; Georges, Marjolaine; Piroth, Lionel; Tubert-Bitter, Pascale; Bonniaud, Philippe; Quantin, Catherine",Eur Respir J,https://doi.org/10.1183/13993003.04474-2020; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34016619/,696

A primary aim for utilization of serological tests are to better quantify the number of COVID-19 cases including those RT-PCR samples were negative but showing clinical and radiological signs of COVID-19. In this study, we aimed to report the features of the patients that were diagnosed and treated as possible COVID-19 cases whose multiple nasopharyngeal swab samples were negative by RT-PCR but serological IgM/IgG antibody against SARS-CoV-2 were detected by rapid antibody test. Method: We retrospectively analyzed eighty suspected COVID-19 cases that have at least two negative consecutive COVID-19 PCR test and were subjected to serological rapid antibody test. Result: The specific antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 were detected as positive in twenty-two patients. The mean age of patient group was 63.2+-13.1 years old with male /female ratio 11/11. Cough was the most common symptom with 90.9%. Most common presenting chest CT findings were bilateral ground glass opacities (77.2%) and alveolar consolidations (50.09%). The mean duration from symptom initiation to hospital admission, to hospitalization, to treatment initiation and to detection of antibody positivity were 8.6 +- 7.2, 11.2 +- 5.4, 7.9 +- 3.2 and 24 +- 17 days, respectively. Conclusion: Our study demonstrated the feasibility of COVID-19 diagnosis based on rapid antibody test in the cases of patients whose RT-PCR samples were negative. We suggest that the detection of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 with rapid antibody test should be included in the diagnostic algorithm in suspected COVID-19 patients.","Yildirim, F.; Yildiz Gulhan, P.; Diken, O.

The persons arrive one by one to the department and the balking and the retention of reneged person approaches are considered. There exists one server presents the service to these persons according to first‐come, first‐served (FCFS) discipline. An efficient and novel algorithm is presented to get the exact value of the probability of n persons in the department at any time interval. This algorithm depends on the Laplace transform to solve a probabilistic dynamical system of differential equations. By considering the exponential detection function and if the probability of the infected person in the department is equal to the probability of each one, then this algorithm is useful to obtain the detection probability of the infected one. Under steady state, the detection probability of the infected person is described. The usefulness of this model is illustrated for different capacities by using a numerical example to describe the behavior of probabilities of the persons in the department, the detection probabilities of the infected person as functions in time, and the mean time to detection.","El‐Hadidy, Mohamed Abd Allah",Math Methods Appl Sci,https://doi.org/10.1002/mma.7443; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34230731/,696

The results show that, first, during the 2007-2008 global financial crisis, the guarantee network became smaller, less connected and more stable because of many bankruptcies; second, the stimulus program encouraged mutual guarantee behaviors, resulting in highly reciprocal and fragile network structure; third, the following monetary policy adjustment enhanced the resilience of the guarantee network by reducing mutual guarantees. Interestingly, our work reveals that the financial crisis made the network more resilient, and conversely, the government bailout degenerated network resilience.

598825,Rapid vaccination and partial lockdown minimizes 4th waves from emerging highly contagious SARS-CoV-2 variants,2021-04-20,"Abstract The sudden appearance of apparently new viruses with pathogenic potential is of fundamental importance in medical microbiology and a constant threat to humans and animals. The emergence of a “new” pathogen is not an isolated event, as for instance the frequent appearance of new influenza virus strains demonstrates. Often the new virus strains co-circulate with the older strains in a susceptible population, but a replacement of the older strains has been also observed. In rare instances the new viruses can cause dramatic epidemics or pandemics, such as those observed with the human immunodeficiency virus, canine parvovirus, or most recently, with the agent of bovine spongiform encephalopathy in the United Kingdom. The mechanisms of the emergence are not always clearly understood, but an altered host range appears to be a common event. Whether a true change in host range occurs, or whether the virus adapted to the host and replicated more efficiently, is often unknown. This review tries to summarize the facts that are known about a wide variety of “new” viruses of mammals, such as the simian, human and feline lentiviruses, the feline coronaviruses, the feline parvoviruses, the carnivore morbilliviruses, the influenza A viruses, and the transmissible spongiform encephalopathies. A particular emphasis will be put on the genetic mechanisms that might have taken place and that might have been responsible for their sudden appearance.","Truyen, Uwe; Parrish, Colin R.; Harder, Timm C.; Kaaden, Oskar-Rüger",Veterinary Microbiology,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/037811359592531F; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/037811359592531F; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7740750/,696
599243,Dynamics of RT-qPCR SARS-CoV-2 Detection Rates Prior to and After Symptom Onset,2020-07-11,"SARS-CoV-2 and its induced COVID-19 remains as a global health calamity. Severe symptoms and high mortality, caused by cytokine storm and acute respiratory distress syndrome in the lower respiratory airway, are always associated with elderly individuals and those with comorbidities; whereas mild or moderate COVID-19 patients have limited upper respiratory flu-like symptoms. There is an urgent need to investigate SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses replication and immune responses in human respiratory systems. The human reconstituted airway epithelial air-liquid interface (ALI) models are the most physiologically relevant model for the investigation of coronavirus infection and virus-triggered innate immune signatures. We established ALI models representing both the upper and the lower respiratory airway to characterize the coronavirus infection kinetics, tissue pathophysiology, and innate immune signatures from upper and lower respiratory tract perspective. Our data suggested these in vitro ALI models maintain high physiological relevance with human airway tissues. The coronavirus induced immune response observed in these upper and lower respiratory airway models are similar to what has been reported in COVID-19 patients. The antiviral efficacy results of a few promising anti-coronavirus drugs in these models were consistent with previous reports and could be valuable for the human dose prediction. Taken together, our study demonstrates the importance of 3D airway epithelial ALI model for the understanding of coronavirus pathogenesis and the discovery and development of anti-coronavirus drugs.","Zhang, Yaling; Ma, Dingailu; Zhang, David Jitao; Liu, Xin’an; Zhu, Qihui; Wang, Li; Gao, Lu",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.03.03.433824,696

The viral entry of SARS-CoV-2 depends on an interaction between the receptor binding domain of its trimeric Spike glycoprotein and the human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor. A better understanding of the Spike/ACE2 interaction is still required to design anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapeutics. Here, we investigated the degree of cooperativity of ACE2 within both the SARS-CoV-2 and the closely related SARS-CoV-1 membrane-bound S glycoproteins. We show that there exist differential inter-protomer conformational transitions between both Spike trimers. Interestingly, the SARS-CoV-2 spike exhibits a positive cooperativity for monomeric soluble ACE2 binding when compared to the SARS-CoV-1 spike, which might have more structural restrains. Our findings can be of importance in the development of therapeutics that block the Spike/ACE2 interaction.","Anand, Sai Priya; Chen, Yaozong; Prévost, Jérémie; Gasser, Romain; Beaudoin-Bussières, Guillaume; Abrams, Cameron F.; Pazgier, Marzena; Finzi, Andrés",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.09.07.286567,696

Methods: Clinical data of common COVID-19 patients admitted to the Shanghai public health clinical center for treatment from January 20, 2020 to March 16, 2020 were collected. A retrospective study was conducted and the patients were divided into two groups according to whether they used proton pump inhibitors or not. The differences in SARS-CoV-2 clearance and hospital stay between the two groups were compared by univariate and multivariate analyses. Results: A total of 154 COVID-19 common cases were included in this study, including 80 males (51.9%), 35 patients (22.7%) in the proton pump inhibitors group, and 119 patients (77.3%) in the control group. In the proton pump inhibitors group and the control group, the duration of SARS-CoV-2 clearance were 7(6-9) and 7(6-11) days, and the duration of hospital stay was 21(16-25) and 20(15-26) days, respectively.

We sought to determine if patients treated with high flow nasal cannula (HFNC) prior to mechanical ventilation had differing outcomes compared to those treated only with conventional oxygen. METHODS: This was a prospective, observational study of patients with COVID-19 admitted to a tertiary care medical center with a diagnosis of acute hypoxic respiratory failure. Adult patients with a positive polymerase chain reaction test for COVID-19 who required mechanical ventilation were included. RESULTS: A total of 91 patients met the inclusion criteria for our study. The mean age was 68.4 years (standard deviation [SD] ± 12) and 58% were male. The mean initial partial pressure of arterial oxygen to fraction of inspired oxygen (PaO2/FiO2) ratio was 152 (SD ± 65) and was not significantly different between the HFNC group and the conventional oxygen strategy group (P = 0.95). The observed mortality rate was 30% in the HFNC group versus 52% in the conventional oxygen strategy group (P = 0.05). The multivariate odds ratio of mortality for patients on HFNC was 0.375 compared to a conventional oxygen strategy (95% confidence interval 0.122–1.151, P = 0.09).

Many polysaccharides, such as sulfated xylomannan, xylan, pectins, fucoidans, glucans, glucoarabinan, and arabinoxylan from Indian medicinal plants, have been shown to exhibit antiviral and immunomodulating activities. Plant polysaccharides exhibit antiviral activities through interference with the viral life cycle and inhibition of attachment of virus to host cell. Intake of certain immune stimulating plant polysaccharides may also protect from the virus to a certain extent. In process of continuous search for most potent drug, Indian plant polysaccharides may emerge as significant biomaterial to combat COVID-19.

OBJECTIVES: We developed a sensitive, specific, and quantitative real-time PCR assay based on the TaqMan method for HBoV detection and quantification in respiratory specimens. STUDY DESIGN: Three individual real-time PCR assays were designed to amplify HBoV NS1, NP-1, and VP1 genes. For clinical evaluation, 506 nasal aspirates obtained from patients with acute respiratory tract infections during December 2006 to May 2007 were tested. RESULTS: Each assay had a broad dynamic range (50 × 10(7) to 5 × 10(7) copies of plasmid DNA) and high inter- and intra-assay reproducibility. The detection limit of each assay was 10 genome copies per reaction, and no crossreactivity with other major respiratory viruses or bacteria was detected.

Lack of the effective antiviral therapy endorses the urgency for the development of vaccine against these deadly viruses. In this study, we employed various computational approaches to identify epitopes which has the potential for vaccine development. By analyzing the immune parameters of the conserved sequences of G glycoprotein using various databases and bioinformatics tools, we identified two potential epitopes which may be used as peptide vaccines. Using different B cell epitope prediction servers, four highly similar B cell epitopes were identified. Immunoinformatics analyses revealed that LAEDDTNAQKT is a highly flexible and accessible B-cell epitope to antibody. Highly similar putative CTL epitopes were analyzed for their binding with the HLA-C 12*03 molecule. Docking simulation assay revealed that LTDKIGTEI has significantly lower binding energy, which bolstered its potential as epitope-based vaccine design. Finally, cytotoxicity analysis has also justified their potential as promising epitope-based vaccine candidate.

METHODS: All IR procedures performed between January 30 and April 8, 2020 (COVID-era group) and the same 2019 period (non-COVID-era group) were retrospectively included and compared. A sub-analysis for the lockdown period (LDP: 11 March–8 April) was also conducted. Demographic, hospitalization, clinical, and procedural data were obtained for both groups and statistically compared with univariable analysis. RESULTS: A total of 1496 procedures (non-COVID era, 825; COVID era, 671) performed in 1226 patients (64.9 ± 15.1 years, 618 women) were included. The number of procedures decreased by 18.6% between 2019 and 2020 (825 vs 671, p < .001), with a reduction by 48.2% in LDP (188 vs 363, p < .0001). In the LDP COVID era, bedside procedures were preferred (p = .013), with an increase in procedures from the intensive care unit compared with the emergency department and outpatients (p = .048), and an increased activity for oncological patients (p = .003).

Limitation of the pandemic is mainly facilitated by reducing infections. An effective strategy is social distancing. However, this strategy draws more and more criticism, in Germany as elsewhere, because of its economic and psychological consequences for society. How can the number of infected person be held below the medical care capacity while restrictions affecting the general public are minimized? Various approaches exist to retarding the infection rate during the current coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak until vaccine has been developed, without overloading medical capacity. Options being discussed include large-scale testing, contact tracing and social distancing. A study published by the Imperial College contains a model calculation of the effects of alternating school closings and openings in the United States and the United Kingdom. However, no satisfactory solution was developed. Variables which describe the medical care resources in Germany and the age and occupational structure of its population contrast sharply with American and British conditions. This study attempts to apply the Imperial College approach of alternating quarantine and normal episodes for the entire population. Mathematically, an oscillation in hospitalization can be imposed.

In particular, substantial research investment has advanced monoclonal antibody therapies to the clinic where they have shown partial efficacy in reducing viral burden and hospitalization. An alternative is to use the host entry receptor, angiotensin‐converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), as a soluble decoy that broadly blocks SARS‐associated coronaviruses with limited potential for viral escape. Here, we summarize efforts to engineer higher affinity variants of soluble ACE2 that rival the potency of affinity‐matured antibodies. Strategies have also been used to increase the valency of ACE2 decoys for avid spike interactions and to improve pharmacokinetics via IgG fusions. Finally, the intrinsic catalytic activity of ACE2 for the turnover of the vasoconstrictor angiotensin II may directly address COVID‐19 symptoms and protect against lung and cardiovascular injury, conferring dual mechanisms of action unachievable by monoclonal antibodies. Soluble ACE2 derivatives therefore have the potential to be next generation therapeutics for addressing the immediate needs of the current pandemic and possible future outbreaks.","Jing, Wenyang; Procko, Erik",Proteins,https://doi.org/10.1002/prot.26140; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33973262/,696
608230,"A simple, safe and sensitive method for SARS‐CoV‐2 inactivation and RNA extraction for RT‐qPCR",2021-03-17,"Cardiac sarcoidosis (CS) is an unusual, but potentially harmful, manifestation of systemic sarcoidosis (SA), a chronic disease characterized by organ involvement from noncaseating and nonnecrotizing granulomas. Lungs and intrathoracic lymph nodes are usually the sites that are most frequently affected, but no organ is spared and CS can affect a variable portion of SA patients, up to 25% from post-mortem studies. The cardiovascular involvement is usually associated with a bad prognosis and is responsible for the major cause of death and complications, particularly in African American patients. Furthermore, the diagnosis is often complicated by the occurrence of non-specific clinical manifestations, which can mimic the effect of more common heart disorders, and imaging and biopsies are the most valid approach to avoid misdiagnosis. This narrative review summarizes the main clinical features of CS and imaging findings, particularly of CMR and 18-Fluorodeoxyglucose Positron Emission Tomography (18F-FDG PET) that can give the best cost/benefit ratio in terms of the diagnostic approach. Imaging can be very useful in replacing the endomyocardial biopsy in selected cases, to avoid unnecessary, and potentially dangerous, invasive maneuvers.","Tana, Claudio; Mantini, Cesare; Donatiello, Iginio; Mucci, Luciano; Tana, Marco; Ricci, Fabrizio; Cipollone, Francesco; Giamberardino, Maria Adele",J Clin Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34062709/; https://doi.org/10.3390/jcm10091941,696

METHODS: All subjects underwent three-timepoint ocular examinations that were measured in July 2019, January, and August 2020. We compared the changes in uncorrected visual acuity (UCVA), mydriatic spherical equivalent (SE), and axial length (AL) between two periods (before and during COVID-19). A questionnaire was performed to investigate risk factors for myopia. RESULTS: Compared with before the COVID-19, the mean (S.D.) myopia progression during the COVID-19 was significantly higher in right eyes (− 0.93 (0.65) vs. − 0.33 (0.47) D; p < 0.001). However, the differences in UCVA changes and the axial elongation between two periods were clinically insignificant. Through logistic regressive analysis, we found the difference of the SE changes was associated with the baseline AL (P = 0.028; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.058, 2.632), online education (P = 0.02; 95% CI, 1.587, 8.665), and time of digital screen (p < 0.005; 95% CI, 1.587, 4.450). CONCLUSIONS: Children were at higher risk of myopia progression during COVID-19, which was associated with the baseline AL, the longtime online learning, and digital screen reading.","Ma, Dandan; Wei, Shifei; Li, Shi-Ming; Yang, Xiaohui; Cao, Kai; Hu, Jianping; Fan, Sujie; Zhang, Lihua; Wang, Ningli",Graefes Arch Clin Exp Ophthalmol,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00417-021-05305-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34287693/,696

Les professionnels en charge, généralement des spécialistes de l’aide psychologique d’urgence, étaient aux prises avec une situation inédite, différente des catastrophes pour lesquelles ils se préparent habituellement. La pandémie et les mesures de distanciation menaçant potentiellement la cohésion sociale, ils ont cherché, avec les hotlines, à réintroduire une forme de proximité, en soignant et cultivant le lien. La situation de pression et d’urgence, les inquiétudes des autorités et de la population, ainsi que les attentes politiques et sociétales ont favorisé le développement de ces structures. Des facteurs comme le besoin d’être utile et d’occuper une place, ou celui d’agir pour maîtriser les mouvements d’angoisse suscités par une situation inconnue et inquiétante ont certainement aussi joué un rôle chez les professionnels impliqués. Dans l’ensemble cependant, ces hotlines n’ont été que peu sollicitées, et leur utilité peut poser question. Cela renvoie à d’autres domaines où ont pu naître de nombreuses nouvelles offres, pas toujours en adéquation avec les besoins identifiés, alors même que beaucoup de structures existantes étaient parallèlement sous-employées, en particulier dans le domaine sanitaire. Ces constats plaident pour la nécessité d’éviter les réponses dans l’urgence lors de situations de crise et de penser les dispositifs à mettre en place plutôt que de les agir. Abstract In Switzerland and elsewhere, many psychological support hotlines were set up during the acute phase of the COVID-19 pandemic. Specialists in psychological first aid, in charge to develop and manage these hotlines, had to face an unknown situation, very different from the disasters for which they prepare themselves. Since the pandemic and the associated physical distancing was a potential threat to social cohesion, one could make the hypothesis that, by setting up hotlines, these professionals sought to reintroduce a form of proximity and to care for and cultivate the social connections among people. The pressure, feelings of emergency, anxious anticipation and expectation of the political authorities and the population, may all have favored the development of these structures. Other factors certainly also played a role, such as the need to be useful and to exist as professional, or the need to act in order to reduce anxiety related to the pandemic. Altogether, these hotlines were little used, and their usefulness may be questioned. Similar phenomena have been observed – especially in the sanitary domain - with a multiplication of new offers, not always adjusted to specific identified needs, while health care services were on the same time under-used. Our observations plead against emergency responses in crisis situations and for reflecting on the measures to be put in place rather than to ""act"" them.","Michaud, Laurent; Bourquin, Céline; Froté, Yves; Stiefel, Friedrich; Saillant, Stéphane",Ann Med Psychol (Paris),https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0003448720302262; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003448720302262?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.amp.2020.08.014; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32863390/,696

While there is evidence for autoimmunity in severe COVID-19, the exact mechanisms remain unknown. Here, we established a prospective observational cohort to study lung specific autoantibodies (auto-Abs). Incubation of plasma from severe COVID-19 patients with healthy human lung tissue revealed the presence of IgA antibodies binding to surfactant-producing pneumocytes. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) and protein pull-downs using porcine surfactant confirmed the presence of auto-Abs binding to surfactant proteins in severe COVID-19 patients. Mass spectrometry and ELISAs with recombinant proteins identified IgA auto-Abs that target human surfactant proteins B and C. In line with these findings, lungs of deceased COVID-19 patients showed reduced pulmonary surfactant. Our data suggest that IgA-driven autoimmunity against surfactant may result in disease progression of COVID-19.","Sinnberg, T.; Lichtensteiger, C.; Hasan Ali, O.; Pop, O.

610773,Rise and Fall of SARS-CoV-2 Lineage A.27 in Germany,2021-07-29,"BACKGROUND: Although primary and established human hepatoma cell lines have been evaluated for hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection in vitro, thus far only Huh7 cells have been found to be highly permissive for infectious HCV. Since our understanding of the HCV lifecycle would benefit from the identification of additional permissive cell lines, we assembled a panel of hepatic and non-hepatic cell lines and assessed their ability to support HCV infection. Here we show infection of the human hepatoma cell lines PLC/PRF/5 and Hep3B with cell culture-derived HCV (HCVcc), albeit to lower levels than that achieved in Huh7 cells. To better understand the reduced permissiveness of PLC and Hep3B cells for HCVcc infection, we performed studies to evaluate the ability of each cell line to support specific steps of the viral lifecycle (i.e. entry, replication, egress and spread). RESULTS: We found that while the early events in HCV infection (i.e. entry plus replication initiation) are cumulatively equivalent or only marginally reduced in PLC and Hep3B cells, later steps of the viral life cycle such as steady-state replication, de novo virus production and/or spread are impaired to different degrees in PLC and Hep3B cultures compared to Huh7 cell cultures. Interestingly, we also observed that interferon stimulated gene (i.e. ISG56) expression was significantly and differentially up-regulated in PLC and Hep3B cells following viral infection. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that the restrictions observed later during HCV infection in these cell lines could in part be attributed to HCV-induced innate signaling. Nevertheless, the identification of two new cell lines capable of supporting authentic HCVcc infection, even at reduced levels, expands the current repertoire of cell lines amendable for the study of HCV in vitro and should aid in further elucidating HCV biology and the cellular determinants that modulate HCV infection.","Sainz, Bruno; Barretto, Naina; Yu, Xuemei; Corcoran, Peter; Uprichard, Susan L",Virol J,https://doi.org/10.1186/1743-422x-9-30; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22273112/,696

FOP patients carry heterozygous gene point mutations in activin A receptor type I ACVR1, encoding the bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) type I serine/threonine kinase receptor ALK2, termed activin receptor-like kinase (ALK)2. The mutant ALK2 displays neofunctional responses to activin, a closely related BMP cytokine that normally inhibits regular bone formation. Moreover, the mutant ALK2 becomes hypersensitive to BMPs. Both these activities contribute to enhanced ALK2 signalling and endochondral bone formation in connective tissue. Being a receptor with an extracellular ligand-binding domain and intrinsic intracellular kinase activity, the mutant ALK2 is a druggable target. Although there is no approved cure for FOP yet, a number of clinical trials have been recently initiated, aiming to identify a safe and effective treatment for FOP. Among other targeted approaches, several repurposed drugs have shown promising results. In this review, we describe the molecular mechanisms underlying ALK2 mutation-induced aberrant signalling and ectopic bone formation. In addition, we recapitulate existing in vitro models to screen for novel compounds with a potential application in FOP. We summarize existing therapeutic alternatives and focus on repositioned drugs in FOP, at preclinical and clinical stages.","Ventura, Francesc; Williams, Eleanor; Ikeya, Makoto; Bullock, Alex N.; ten Dijke, Peter; Goumans, Marie-José; Sanchez-Duffhues, Gonzalo",Biomedicines,https://doi.org/10.3390/biomedicines9020213; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33669809/,696

We performed a systematic review of literature and a pooled analysis to provide precise estimates of the mortality rate among patients with both hematological malignancy and COVID-19. Methods: We performed a systematic literature search including peer-reviewed publications, preprints, and conference proceedings up to July 16, 2020. Only studies including exclusively patients with hematological malignancies were considered. The primary endpoint was the case fatality rate (CFR), which was defined as rate of death in patients with hematological malignancy and COVID-19. A random effects model was used to derive a pooled CFR and its 95% confidence interval (CI). Results: In total, 10 studies including 751 patients with both COVID-19 and hematological malignancy were selected for the pooled analysis (Table 1). A total of 257 deaths were recorded in this population. The probability of death was 37·48% (95% CI 27·74% to 48.36%; I2=48·1%) in this patient population (Figure 1). [Data will be updated closer to the ASH 2020 meeting]. Conclusions: Patients with both COVID-19 and hematological malignancy have a higher probability of mortality compared to patients with COVID-19 but without underlying malignancy. Optimally and tailored preventive measures are needed to reduce the risk of COVID-19 infection in patients with hematological malignancies; this patient population should be priority for vaccine campaigns.

We assessed the immunogenicity of BNT162b2 (Pfizer/BioNTech) administered as a second dose in healthcare workers primed with ChAdOx1-S (Vaxzevria, AstraZeneca). Methods: 197 healthcare workers were included in a monocentric observational study in Foch hospital, France, between June and July 2021. The main outcome was the immunogenicity measured by serum SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies. Results: 130 participants received the ChAdOx1-S/BNT vaccine and 67 received the BNT/BNT vaccine. The geometric mean of IgG antibodies was significantly higher in the BNT/BNT vaccine group compared to the ChAdOx1-S/BNT vaccine group, namely 10,734.9, 95% CI (9141.1–12,589.3) vs. 7268.6, 95% CI (6501.3–8128.3), respectively (p < 0.001). However, after adjustment for time duration between the prime and second vaccinations, no significant difference was observed (p = 0.181). A negative correlation between antibody levels and time duration between second dose and serology test was observed for the BNT/BNT vaccine (p < 0.001), which remained significant after adjustment for all covariates (p < 0.001), but not for the ChAdOx1-S/BNT vaccine (p = 0.467). Conclusions: Heterologous and homologous schedules of ChAdOx1-S and BNT vaccines present robust immune responses after the second vaccination. The results observed were equivalent after adjustment for covariates and emphasize the importance of flexibility in deploying mRNA and viral vectored vaccines. Nevertheless, applying the ChAdOx1-S schedule vaccination for the heterologous second dose of BNT was associated with decreased IgG antibody levels compared to the homologous BNT/BNT vaccination.","Vallée, Alexandre; Vasse, Marc; Mazaux, Laurence; Bonan, Brigitte; Amiel, Carline; Zia-Chahabi, Sara; Chan-Hew-Wai, Aurélie; Farfour, Eric; Camps, Eve; Touche, Pauline; Barret, Flavie; Parquin, François; Zucman, David; Fourn, Erwan",J Clin Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34501264/; https://doi.org/10.3390/jcm10173817,696

A 1038-nucleotide fragment was PCR amplified and directly sequenced. The analysed BCoV strains showed a high sequence identity, regardless of whether they were obtained from outbreaks of respiratory disease or diarrhoea or from calves or adult cattle. Circulation of an identical BCoV strain during a 4-month period was demonstrated in calves in one dairy herd. In a regional epizootic of winter dysentery in Northern Sweden, highly similar BCoV strains were detected. In the Southern and Central regions, several genotypes of BCoV circulated contemporaneously, indicating that in these regions, which had a higher density of cattle than the Northern regions, more extensive transmission of the virus was occurring. Identical BCoV sequences supported the epidemiological data that inter-herd contact through purchased calves was important. Swedish BCoV strains unexpectedly showed a high homology with recently detected Italian strains. This study shows that molecular analysis of the spike (S) glycoprotein gene of BCoV can be a useful tool to support or rule out suspected transmission routes.","Bidokhti, Mehdi R.M.; Tråvén, Madeleine; Ohlson, Anna; Baule, Claudia; Hakhverdyan, Mikhayil; Belák, Sándor; Liu, Lihong; Alenius, Stefan",Vet J,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tvjl.2011.12.015; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1090023311004941; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22750286/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1090023311004941,696

Methods: One hundred and three Italian male and female adolescents between 12 and 18 were administered the DIN, SCIDII, CSSRS, and Kiddie-SADS with six months follow-up. Results: The correlation, t-test, multiple regression analyses evidenced the association of narcissistic affective states and mood with both suicidal ideation and lethality of conduct. The increase in the dimension of grandiosity is associated with the passage to potentially highly lethal suicidal gestures. Conclusions: Suicidal ideation and conduct seem to serve the function of restoring a sense of control and self-esteem in narcissistic individuals experiencing a state of affective dysregulation. Narcissistic pathological functioning seems to play an important role in the adolescent suicidal process, quite like adulthood.

617338,Interactive SARS-CoV-2 mutation timemaps,2021-02-03,"The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic has affected nearly 28 million people in the United States and has caused more than five hundred thousand deaths as of February 21, 2021. As the novel coronavirus continues to take its toll in the United States and all across the globe, particularly among the elderly (>65 years), clinicians and translational researchers are taking a closer look at the nexus of sleep, circadian rhythms and immunity that may contribute toward a more severe coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19). SARS-CoV-2-induced multi-organ failure affects both central and peripheral organs, causing increased mortality in the elderly. However, whether differences in sleep, circadian rhythms, and immunity between older and younger individuals contribute to the age-related differences in systemic dysregulation of target organs observed in SARS-CoV-2 infection remain largely unknown. Current literature demonstrates the emerging role of sleep, circadian rhythms, and immunity in the development of chronic pulmonary diseases and respiratory infections in human and mouse models. The exact mechanism underlying acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and other cardiopulmonary complications in elderly patients in combination with associated comorbidities remain unclear. Nevertheless, understanding the critical role of sleep, circadian clock dysfunction in target organs, and immune status of patients with SARS-CoV-2 may provide novel insights into possible therapies. Chronotherapy is an emerging concept that is gaining attention in sleep medicine. Accumulating evidence suggests that nearly half of all physiological functions follow a strict daily rhythm. However, healthcare professionals rarely take implementing timed-administration of drugs into consideration. In this review, we summarize recent findings directly relating to the contributing roles of sleep, circadian rhythms and immune response in modulating infectious disease processes, and integrate chronotherapy in the discussion of the potential drugs that can be repurposed to improve the treatment and management of COVID-19.","Giri, Allan; Srinivasan, Ashokkumar; Sundar, Isaac Kirubakaran",Front Neurosci,https://doi.org/10.3389/fnins.2021.674204; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34220430/,696

619447,A dynamic nomenclature proposal for SARS-CoV-2 to assist genomic epidemiology,2020-04-19,"The coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is having a widespread impact on societies across the globe. As part of the effort to control transmission in the United States, many businesses either closed or instituted nonpharmaceutical control measures and allowed only essential workers on-site. During summer and fall of 2020, employers began formulating “return to work” strategies designed to mitigate the risk of transmission among employees. On a population level, several countries implemented national testing and surveillance strategies that proved effective in mitigating citizen-to-citizen transmission and contributed to suppressing COVID-19. A crucial component of many such strategies is population-based testing to identify and engage individuals with asymptomatic or presymptomatic infection, which also is relevant to return-to-work strategies. The authors describe an approach that multisite employers might use to help mitigate transmission of COVID-19 in the workplace. This approach leverages a bioinformatics platform informed by real-time PCR test data at the county and subcounty (eg, Public Use Microdata Area) level, allowing for population-based testing to be selectively targeted for employees in geographies with elevated SARS-CoV-2 positivity. A “Command Center” application integrates data from multiple sources (eg, local infection trends, employee symptom diaries, Bluetooth thermometers) in real time, which can be used to inform decisions regarding surveillance and employee self-isolation or quarantine; a mobile phone-based application provides for rapid, secure communication with employees. This overview is based on peer-reviewed literature and the early experience of a large employer with implementing bioinformatics tools to mitigate the impact of the pandemic on the workplace.","Plantes, Peter J.; Fragala, Maren S.; Clarke, Charles; Goldberg, Zachary N.; Radcliff, Jeff; Goldberg, Steven E.",Popul Health Manag,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33493409/; https://doi.org/10.1089/pop.2020.0322,696

The prime examples of these are the lyssaviruses and Henipavirus. The transmission of Nipah, Hendra and perhaps SARS coronavirus and Ebola virus to humans may involve intermediate amplification hosts such as pigs, horses, civets and primates, respectively. Understanding of the natural reservoir or introductory host, the amplifying host, the epidemic centre and at‐risk human populations are crucial in the control of emerging zoonosis. The association between the bat coronaviruses and certain lyssaviruses with particular bat species implies co‐evolution between specific viruses and bat hosts. Cross‐infection between the huge number of bat species may generate new viruses which are able to jump the trans‐mammalian species barrier more efficiently. The currently known viruses that have been found in bats are reviewed and the risks of transmission to humans are highlighted. Certain families of bats including the Pteropodidae, Molossidae, Phyllostomidae, and Vespertilionidae are most frequently associated with known human pathogens. A systematic survey of bats is warranted to better understand the ecology of these viruses.

The purpose of this systematic review is to summarize psychosocial factors related to depressive symptoms of Asian American adolescents between the ages of 10 to 19. Methods: Various electronic databases were systematically searched to identify research articles published from 2000 to 2021, and the psychosocial factors influencing depression among Asian adolescents in North America were examined. Results: A total of 81 studies were included in this systematic review. Consistent findings on relationships between depressive symptoms and influencing factors included (a) acculturative stress, (b) religious or spiritual significance for females, (c) parent–child cohesion, (d) harsh parenting style, (e) responsive parenting style, (f) racial or ethnic discrimination, (g) being bullied, (h) positive mentor presence, and (i) exposure to community violence. Collectively, the majority of included studies suggest that depressive symptoms were more likely found among Asian American adolescents who (a) are older, (b) are female, (c) have immigrant status, (d) exhibit coping behaviours, (e) face academic challenges, (f) face a poor socioeconomic situation, (g) perceive parent–child conflict, (h) perceive maternal disconnectedness, and (i) perceive negative peer relations. A number of conflictive findings also existed. Discussion/Conclusions: This systematic review provides a summary of the various psychosocial factors on individual, familial, and social levels, which influenced the depressive symptoms of Asian American adolescents. Such findings offer a starting point to examine what factors should be necessarily included in related depression-preventive intervention design and evaluation. Culturally sensitive care, strengthened family–school–community collaboration, and targeted research efforts are needed to meet the needs of Asian adolescents experiencing a range of depressive symptoms.","Zou, Ping; Siu, Annisa; Wang, Xiyi; Shao, Jing; Hallowell, Sunny G.; Yang, Lihua Lydia; Zhang, Hui",Healthcare (Basel),https://doi.org/10.3390/healthcare9050537; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34064345/,696
620500,Wastewater SARS-CoV-2 Concentration and Loading Variability from Grab and 24-Hour Composite Samples,2020-07-11,"BACKGROUND: Non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPI) are the first line of defense against pandemic influenza. These interventions dampen virus spread by reducing contact between infected and susceptible persons. Because they curtail essential societal activities, they must be applied judiciously. Optimal control theory is an approach for modeling and balancing competing objectives such as epidemic spread and NPI cost. METHODS: We apply optimal control on an epidemiologic compartmental model to develop triggers for NPI implementation. The objective is to minimize expected person-days lost from influenza related deaths and NPI implementations for the model. We perform a multivariate sensitivity analysis based on Latin Hypercube Sampling to study the effects of input parameters on the optimal control policy. Additional studies investigated the effects of departures from the modeling assumptions, including exponential terminal time and linear NPI implementation cost. RESULTS: An optimal policy is derived for the control model using a linear NPI implementation cost. Linear cost leads to a ""bang-bang"" policy in which NPIs are applied at maximum strength when certain state criteria are met. Multivariate sensitivity analyses are presented which indicate that NPI cost, death rate, and recovery rate are influential in determining the policy structure. Further death rate, basic reproductive number and recovery rate are the most influential in determining the expected cumulative death. When applying the NPI policy, the cumulative deaths under exponential and gamma terminal times are close, which implies that the outcome of applying the ""bang-bang"" policy is insensitive to the exponential assumption. Quadratic cost leads to a multi-level policy in which NPIs are applied at varying strength levels, again based on certain state criteria. Results indicate that linear cost leads to more costly implementation resulting in fewer deaths. CONCLUSIONS: The application of optimal control theory can provide valuable insight to developing effective control strategies for pandemic. Our findings highlight the importance of establishing a sensitive and timely surveillance system for pandemic preparedness.","Lin, Feng; Muthuraman, Kumar; Lawley, Mark",BMC Infect Dis,https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2334-10-32; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20170501/,696

These include the loss of needed care, a higher probability of infection, and the worsening of their mental health. To analyze the pandemic’s impact on care received, relapses, loss of employment, and adherence to preventive guidelines in SMD sufferers, a multicenter retrospective cohort study was carried out comparing 185 patients diagnosed with SMD and 85 with common disorders. The results showed that during lockdown, there was a significant reduction in face-to-face psychotherapeutic, nursing, and occupational therapy interventions. In the same period, telematic interventions were introduced which, although subsequently reduced, now continue to be used to a greater extent than before the pandemic. Employment decreased significantly (13% vs. 9.2%; 𝜒(2) = 126.228 p < 0.001). The percentage of people with SMD following preventive guidelines was significantly lower for both hand washing (56.2% vs. 75.3%; 𝜒(2) = 9.360, p = 0.002) and social distancing (47% vs. 63.5; 𝜒(2) = 6.423 p = 0.011). In conclusion, the COVID-19 pandemic has led to a reduction in the interventions that are needed for the recovery of people with SMDs, together with a significant loss of employment and an increased risk of contagion due to less adherence to preventive guidelines. In the future, appropriate attention to these people’s needs must be guaranteed.","Sánchez-Guarnido, Antonio José; Hidalgo, Nuria; Arenas de la Cruz, Jorge; Esteban, Inmaculada; Mondón, Silvia; Herruzo, Carlos",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18168549; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34444298/,696

Method: A longitudinal design was applied with the first measurement in February 2018 (N = 1039). The second measurement (N = 400) was carried out in December 2020 to test if the pandemic influenced the trust in different sources of information. Results: The final analyses carried out on final sample of 400 participants showed that there has been no change in trust in the Internet as a source of knowledge about health during the pandemic. However, the trust in science, physicians, subjective health knowledge, as well as the attitude towards the vaccination has declined. Regression analysis also showed that changes in the level of trust in physicians and science were associated with analogous (in the same direction) changes in attitudes toward vaccination. The study was also focused on the trust in different sources of health knowledge as possible predictors of willingness to be vaccinated against SARS-nCoV-2. However, it appeared that the selected predictors explained a small part of the variance. This suggests that attitudes toward the new COVID vaccines may have different sources than attitudes toward vaccines that have been known to the public for a long time.","Stasiuk, Katarzyna; Polak, Mateusz; Dolinski, Dariusz; Maciuszek, Jozef",Vaccines (Basel),https://doi.org/10.3390/vaccines9080933; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34452058/,696
621102,Existing human mobility data sources poorly predicted the spatial spread of SARS-CoV-2 in Madagascar,2021-08-02,"Lung CT image segmentation is a key process in many applications such as lung cancer detection. It is considered a challenging problem due to existing similar image densities in the pulmonary structures, different types of scanners, and scanning protocols. Most of the current semi-automatic segmentation methods rely on human factors therefore it might suffer from lack of accuracy. Another shortcoming of these methods is their high false-positive rate. In recent years, several approaches, based on a deep learning framework, have been effectively applied in medical image segmentation. Among existing deep neural networks, the U-Net has provided great success in this field. In this paper, we propose a deep neural network architecture to perform an automatic lung CT image segmentation process. In the proposed method, several extensive preprocessing techniques are applied to raw CT images. Then, ground truths corresponding to these images are extracted via some morphological operations and manual reforms. Finally, all the prepared images with the corresponding ground truth are fed into a modified U-Net in which the encoder is replaced with a pre-trained ResNet-34 network (referred to as Res BCDU-Net). In the architecture, we employ BConvLSTM (Bidirectional Convolutional Long Short-term Memory)as an advanced integrator module instead of simple traditional concatenators. This is to merge the extracted feature maps of the corresponding contracting path into the previous expansion of the up-convolutional layer. Finally, a densely connected convolutional layer is utilized for the contracting path. The results of our extensive experiments on lung CT images (LIDC-IDRI database) confirm the effectiveness of the proposed method where a dice coefficient index of 97.31% is achieved.","Jalali, Yeganeh; Fateh, Mansoor; Rezvani, Mohsen; Abolghasemi, Vahid; Anisi, Mohammad Hossein",Sensors (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33401581/; https://doi.org/10.3390/s21010268,696

Out of 356 retrieved articles, a total of 34 papers were included in our review. Of those, 15 assessed the association between urban greenspace and PA and 19 dealt with MH. Almost all the included studies found a positive association between urban greenspace and both PA and MH, while a few demonstrated a non-effect or a negative effect on MH outcomes. However, only guaranteeing access is not enough. Indeed, important elements are maintenance, renovation, closeness to residential areas, planning of interactive activities, and perceived security aspects.

METHODS: Single-centre cohort performed from 3 March 2020 to 14 April 2020 in four intensive care units in Bordeaux University Hospital, France. All patients with COVID-19 and pulmonary severity criteria were included. AKI was defined using Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) criteria. A systematic urinary analysis was performed. The incidence, severity, clinical presentation, biological characterization (transient versus persistent AKI; proteinuria, haematuria and glycosuria) and short-term outcomes were evaluated. RESULTS: Seventy-one patients were included, with basal serum creatinine (SCr) of 69 ± 21 µmol/L. At admission, AKI was present in 8/71 (11%) patients. Median [interquartile range (IQR)] follow-up was 17 (12–23) days. AKI developed in a total of 57/71 (80%) patients, with 35% Stage 1, 35% Stage 2 and 30% Stage 3 AKI; 10/57 (18%) required renal replacement therapy (RRT). Transient AKI was present in only 4/55 (7%) patients and persistent AKI was observed in 51/55 (93%). Patients with persistent AKI developed a median (IQR) urine protein/creatinine of 82 (54–140) (mg/mmol) with an albuminuria/proteinuria ratio of 0.23 ± 20, indicating predominant tubulointerstitial injury. Only two (4%) patients had glycosuria. At Day 7 after onset of AKI, six (11%) patients remained dependent on RRT, nine (16%) had SCr >200 µmol/L and four (7%) had died.

METHODS: We searched the MEDLINE, as well as BioRxiv and MedRxiv preprint servers for original research published in English from January 1 to May 20, 2020. We used the search terms (COVID-19) OR (SARS-CoV-2) AND (animal models), (hamsters), (nonhuman primates), (macaques), (rodent), (mice), (rats), (ferrets), (rabbits), (cats), and (dogs). Inclusion criteria were the establishment of animal models of COVID-19 as an endpoint. Other inclusion criteria were assessment of prophylaxis, therapies, or vaccines, using animal models of COVID-19. RESULT: Thirteen peer-reviewed studies and 14 preprints met the inclusion criteria. The animals used were nonhuman primates (n = 13), mice (n = 7), ferrets (n = 4), hamsters (n = 4), and cats (n = 1). All animals supported high viral replication in the upper and lower respiratory tract associated with mild clinical manifestations, lung pathology, and full recovery. Older animals displayed relatively more severe illness than the younger ones. No animal models developed hypoxemic respiratory failure, multiple organ dysfunction, culminating in death. All species elicited a specific IgG antibodies response to the spike proteins, which were protective against a second exposure. Transient systemic inflammation was observed occasionally in nonhuman primates, hamsters, and mice. Notably, none of the animals unveiled a cytokine storm or coagulopathy. CONCLUSIONS: Most of the animal models of COVID-19 recapitulated mild pattern of human COVID-19 with full recovery phenotype.

When used to measure communication success, even the most granular affective model combined with sophisticated machine learning approaches may not fully capture an organisation’s strategic positioning goals. Such goals often deviate from the assumptions of standardised affective models. While certain emotions such as Joy and Trust typically represent desirable brand associations, specific communication goals formulated by marketing professionals often go beyond such standard dimensions. For instance, the brand manager of a television show may consider fear or sadness to be desired emotions for its audience. This article introduces expansion techniques for affective models, combining common and commonsense knowledge available in knowledge graphs with language models and affective reasoning, improving coverage and consistency as well as supporting domain-specific interpretations of emotions. An extensive evaluation compares the performance of different expansion techniques: (i) a quantitative evaluation based on the revisited Hourglass of Emotions model to assess performance on complex models that cover multiple affective categories, using manually compiled gold standard data, and (ii) a qualitative evaluation of a domain-specific affective model for television programme brands. The results of these evaluations demonstrate that the introduced techniques support a variety of embeddings and pre-trained models.

OBJECTIVE: To use the National COVID Cohort Collaborative (N3C), a large, multicenter, longitudinal cohort, to characterize the use of hydroxychloroquine, remdesivir, and dexamethasone, overall as well as across individuals, health systems, and time. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. SETTING: 43 health systems in the United States. PARTICIPANTS: 137 870 adults hospitalized with COVID-19 between 1 February 2020 and 28 February 2021. MEASUREMENTS: Inpatient use of hydroxychloroquine, remdesivir, or dexamethasone. RESULTS: Among 137 870 persons hospitalized with confirmed or suspected COVID-19, 8754 (6.3%) received hydroxychloroquine, 29 272 (21.2%) remdesivir, and 53 909 (39.1%) dexamethasone during the study period. Since the release of results from the RECOVERY (Randomised Evaluation of COVID-19 Therapy) trial in mid-June, approximately 78% to 84% of people who have had invasive mechanical ventilation have received dexamethasone or other glucocorticoids. The use of hydroxychloroquine increased during March 2020, peaking at 42%, and started declining by April 2020. By contrast, remdesivir and dexamethasone use gradually increased over the study period. Dexamethasone and remdesivir use varied substantially across health centers (intraclass correlation coefficient, 14.2% for dexamethasone and 84.6% for remdesivir). LIMITATION: Because most N3C data contributors are academic medical centers, findings may not reflect the experience of community hospitals. CONCLUSION: Dexamethasone, an evidence-based treatment of COVID-19, may be underused among persons who are mechanically ventilated.

This stems from the heterogeneous response of individuals to disease and is reflected in the inter-individual variability of gene expression responses that obscures differential gene expression analysis. Here, we developed an alternative approach that could be applied to dissect the disease-associated molecular changes. We define gene ensemble noise as a measure that represents a variance for a collection of genes encoding for either members of known biological pathways or subunits of annotated protein complexes and calculated within an individual. The gene ensemble noise allows for the holistic identification and interpretation of gene expression disbalance on the level of gene networks and systems. By comparing gene expression data from COVID-19, H1N1, and sepsis patients we identified common disturbances in a number of pathways and protein complexes relevant to the sepsis pathology. Among others, these include the mitochondrial respiratory chain complex I and peroxisomes. This suggests a Warburg effect and oxidative stress as common hallmarks of the immune host–pathogen response. Finally, we showed that gene ensemble noise could successfully be applied for the prediction of clinical outcome namely, the mortality of patients. Thus, we conclude that gene ensemble noise represents a promising approach for the investigation of molecular mechanisms of pathology through a prism of alterations in the coherent expression of gene circuits.","de Jong, Tristan V.; Guryev, Victor; Moshkin, Yuri M.",Sci Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34031464/; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-90192-9,696

Depression, generalized anxiety, and social anxiety symptoms were assessed within each program using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9, the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7, and the Social Phobia Inventory, respectively. Linear mixed effects models were built to assess the association between module completion and symptom change among users who completed at least four modules and had at least mild baseline symptom elevations, controlling for age, gender, and baseline symptom severity. Digital+ use, including module completion, 1:1 coaching calls, and in-app coach messaging, was also evaluated. RESULTS: Significant effects were observed among depression (Cohen d=1.5), generalized anxiety (Cohen d=1.2), and social anxiety (Cohen d=1.0) program participants who completed at least four modules and had mild baseline elevations (n=470). Associations between module completion and change in depression (ß=-1.2; P<.001), generalized anxiety (ß=-1.1; P<.001), and social anxiety (ß=-2.4; P<.001) symptom scores retained significance with covariate adjustment. Participants completed an average of 2.6 (SD 2.7) modules. The average total length of app use was 52.2 (SD 83.5) days. Approximately two-thirds of the users engaged in at least 1 coaching call (66.82%, 1267/1896) or in-app text messaging (66.09%, 1253/1896). Participants who completed at least four modules participated in significantly more coaching calls per module (mean 1.1, SD 0.7) than users who completed fewer than four modules (mean 1.0, SD 1.2; t1407=-2.1; P=.03). CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated that AbleTo Digital+ users experienced significant reductions in depression, generalized anxiety, and social anxiety symptoms throughout the program.","Anton, Margaret T; Greenberger, Heidi Mochari; Andreopoulos, Evie; Pande, Reena L",JMIR Form Res,https://doi.org/10.2196/27570; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34546170/,696

For this purpose, data envelopment analysis (DEA) approach is considered and applied. The study findings show that green fiscal policies, such as public supports and tax rebates, have significant role in reducing energy poverty of different international countries by advancing energy efficiency. Therefore, a panel data ranging from 2010 to 2020 is used. Our findings indicate that the aggregate degree of green fiscal policies help to decline energy poverty. Renewable energy companies had larger series of net fiscal competence and size efficiency, and their levels of energy efficiency were greater than 0.457%, with the 16% effect of current public supports and 11% effect of taxation rebates supported to diminish energy poverty with 29.7% in different international economies. This is a positive effect by green fiscal policies. The study also presented policy implications suggesting effectively implementing green fiscal policies for more efficient carbon reduction and making climate change supportive for peoples in post COVID-19 period.","Chien, Fengsheng; Hsu, Ching-Chi; Zhang, YunQian; Tran, Tai Duc; Li, Li",Environ Sci Pollut Res Int,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34406567/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s11356-021-15854-7,696

Although RT-PCR-based molecular diagnosis techniques are being widely applied for clinical diagnosis currently, timely and accurate diagnosis are still limited due to labour intensive and time-consuming operations of these techniques. To address the issue, herein we report the synthesis of poly (amino ester) with carboxyl groups (PC)-coated magnetic nanoparticles (pcMNPs), and the development of pcMNPs-based viral RNA extraction method for the sensitive detection of COVID-19 causing virus, the SARS-CoV-2. This method combines the lysis and binding steps into one step, and the pcMNPs-RNA complexes can be directly introduced into subsequent RT-PCR reactions. The simplified process can purify viral RNA from multiple samples within 20 min using a simple manual method or an automated high-throughput approach. By identifying two different regions (ORFlab and N gene) of viral RNA, a 10-copy sensitivity and a strong linear correlation between 10 and 105 copies of SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus particles are achieved. Benefitting from the simplicity and excellent performances, this new extraction method can dramatically reduce the turn-around time and operational requirements in current molecular diagnosis of COVID-19, in particular for the early clinical diagnosis.","Zhao, Zhen; Cui, Haodong; Song, Wenxing; Ru, Xiaoling; Zhou, Wenhua; Yu, Xuefeng",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.22.961268,696
629004,Challenges of SARS-CoV-2 genomic surveillance in Africa,2021-04-30,"Much of the attention from COVID‐19 has been on the impacts on tourism and other service sectors; but there has been a growing interest in some agricultural and food topics, such as the decline in food away from home (FAFH) expenditures. Our work considers the importance of FAFH in the overall economy, and we also consider changes in agricultural production and trade that have occurred because of COVID‐19. We gather data on actual changes to these components, as well as similar shocks to non‐agricultural sectors, and employ a simulation model to estimate the impacts on gross domestic product (GDP). Results indicate that changes from agriculture due to COVID‐19 have had a larger effect on the overall U.S. economy than the share of agriculture in the economy at the beginning of COVID‐19. But the non‐agricultural shocks still outweigh the impacts from agriculture by a magnitude of 3. Breaking the results down along the components, we find that the loss in FAFH expenditures is the largest contributor to the change in GDP resulting from shocks to agricultural markets and conclude that agricultural production/trade markets have been very resilient during the pandemic. Our results also indicate that our model (computable general equilibrium) does reasonably well in estimating GDP compared to actual changes due to the inclusion of data on actual demand, supply, and fiscal responses to COVID‐19.","Beckman, Jayson; Countryman, Amanda M.",Am J Agric Econ,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33821008/; https://doi.org/10.1111/ajae.12212,696

A peptidomimetic inhibitor AG7088 was developed to inhibit the 3C protease of rhinovirus (a member of the family), a chymotrypsin-like protease required for viral replication, by forming a covalent bond with the active site Cys residue. In this study, we have prepared the recombinant 3C protease from EV71 (TW/2231/98), a particular strain which causes severe outbreaks in Asia, and developed inhibitors against the protease and the viral replication. For inhibitor design, the P3 group of AG7088, which is not interacting with the rhinovirus protease, was replaced with a series of cinnamoyl derivatives directly linked to P2 group through an amide bond to simplify the synthesis. While the replacement caused decreased potency, the activity can be largely improved by substituting the α,β-unsaturated ester with an aldehyde at the P1′ position. The best inhibitor 10b showed EC(50) of 18 nM without apparent toxicity (CC(50) > 25 μM).

Among the aerosol generating procedures, bronchoscopy in particular is an indispensable diagnostic and therapeutic tool that comes with a high risk of infection. Therefore, national societies have issued guidance statements. However, the individual ability of bronchoscopy units to follow these recommendations is largely unknown. METHODS: We conducted a nationwide survey from 1 April 2020 to 7 April 2020 to which 218 German endoscopy units, 105 solely bronchoscopy and 113 interdisciplinary, responded. The survey was distributed electronically via the German Respiratory Society. RESULTS: While 17% of units did not cancel any interventions, 16% cancelled >80% of their interventions. 73% were unable to completely separate high-risk patients. Most procedural measures, such as risk stratification in patients (95%), training to handle COVID-19 patients and personal protective equipment (PPE) (91%), risk adapted use of PPE (85%) and self-monitoring for staff (84%) were adopted well. Unit managers expected shortages in PPE (74%), staff shortages (68%) and severe financial losses (63%). CONCLUSION: In the short-term, PPE shortages are perceived to be the most imminent threat to bronchoscopic activity as a whole. In this era of uncertainty, sound evidence to guide bronchoscopy units and an international concerted effort are urgently needed to formulate recommendations on facts and adapted to local conditions as described in this study.","Heidemann, Clara S.; Garbe, Jakob; Damm, Marko; Walter, Steffen; Michl, Patrick; Rosendahl, Jonas; Darwiche, Kaid; Eisenmann, Stephan",ERJ Open Res,https://doi.org/10.1183/23120541.00396-2020; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32904638/,696

The time-delay adjusted case fatality risk (CFR) of COVID-19 in Korea is yet to be estimated. Methods: We obtained the daily series of confirmed cases and deaths in Korea reported prior to May 9, 2020. Using statistical methods, we estimated the time-delay adjusted risk for death from COVID-19 in Daegu, Gyeongsangbuk-do, other regions in Korea, as well as the entire country. Results: Our model-based crude CFR fitted the observed data well throughout the course of the epidemic except for the very early stage in Gyeongsangbuk-do; this was partially due to the reporting delay. Our estimates of the risk of death in Gyeongsangbuk-do reached 25.9% (95% Credible Interval (CrI): 19.6%–33.6%), 20.8% (95% CrI: 18.1%–24.0%) in Daegu, and 1.7% (95% CrI: 1.1%–2.5%) in other regions, whereas the national estimate was 10.2% (95% CrI: 9.0%–11.5%). Conclusions: The latest estimates of CFR of COVID-19 in Korea are considerably high, even with the early implementation of public health interventions including widespread testing, social distancing, and delayed school openings.

CD46 is another co-stimulatory receptor that promotes differentiation of CD4(+) T-helper cells type 1 (Th1 cells) into a regulatory phenotype with a switch from IFN-γ towards IL-10-secretion over time. Whether CD46 exerts a similar function on CD8(+) T cells remains to be fully elucidated. Here, we demonstrate that CD46 co-stimulation induced secretion of IFN-γ as well as expansion of IFN-γ-secreting CD8(+) T cells. In contrast to CD46 co-stimulation of CD4(+) T cells, CD8(+) T cells did not differentiate into a regulatory IL-10-secreting phenotype. This demonstrates that CD46 is a co-stimulatory receptor on CD8(+) T cells, and that it exerts separate functions during CD4(+) and CD8(+) T-cell differentiation.","Hansen, Aida S.; Slater, Josefine; Biltoft, Mette; Bundgaard, Bettina B.; Møller, Bjarne K.; Höllsberg, Per",Immunol Lett,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29902483/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.imlet.2018.06.003; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165247818301135; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0165247818301135,696

635928,"Sensitive and Specific Detection of SARS-CoV-2 Antibodies Using a High-Throughput, Fully Automated Liquid-Handling Robotic System",2020-08-20,"BACKGROUND: Since December 2019, an outbreak of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-Cov-2) initially emerged in Wuhan, China, and has spread worldwide now. Clinical features of patients with COVID-19 have been described. However, risk factors leading to in-hospital deterioration and poor prognosis in COVID-19 patients with severe disease have not been well identified. METHODS: In this retrospective, single-center cohort study, 1190 adult inpatients (≥ 18 years old) with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 and determined outcomes (discharged or died) were included from Wuhan Infectious Disease Hospital from December 29, 2019 to February 28, 2020. The final follow-up date was March 2, 2020. Clinical data including characteristics, laboratory and imaging information as well as treatments were extracted from electronic medical records and compared. A multivariable logistic regression model was used to explore the potential predictors associated with in-hospital deterioration and death. RESULTS: 1190 patients with confirmed COVID-19 were included. Their median age was 57 years (interquartile range 47–67 years). Two hundred and sixty-one patients (22%) developed a severe illness after admission. Multivariable logistic regression demonstrated that higher SOFA score (OR 1.32, 95% CI 1.22–1.43, per score increase, p < 0.001 for deterioration and OR 1.30, 95% CI 1.11–1.53, per score increase, p = 0.001 for death), lymphocytopenia (OR 1.81, 95% CI 1.13–2.89 p = 0.013 for deterioration; OR 4.44, 95% CI 1.26–15.87, p = 0.021 for death) on admission were independent risk factors for in-hospital deterioration from not severe to severe disease and for death in severe patients. On admission D-dimer greater than 1 μg/L (OR 3.28, 95% CI 1.19–9.04, p = 0.021), leukocytopenia (OR 5.10, 95% CI 1.25–20.78), thrombocytopenia (OR 8.37, 95% CI 2.04–34.44) and history of diabetes (OR 11.16, 95% CI 1.87–66.57, p = 0.008) were also associated with higher risks of in-hospital death in severe COVID-19 patients. Shorter time interval from illness onset to non-invasive mechanical ventilation in the survivors with severe disease was observed compared with non-survivors (10.5 days, IQR 9.25–11.0 vs. 16.0 days, IQR 11.0–19.0 days, p = 0.030). Treatment with glucocorticoids increased the risk of progression from not severe to severe disease (OR 3.79, 95% CI 2.39–6.01, p < 0.001). Administration of antiviral drugs especially oseltamivir or ganciclovir is associated with a decreased risk of death in severe patients (OR 0.17, 95% CI 0.05–0.64, p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: High SOFA score and lymphocytopenia on admission could predict that not severe patients would develop severe disease in-hospital. On admission elevated D-dimer, leukocytopenia, thrombocytopenia and diabetes were independent risk factors of in-hospital death in severe patients with COVID-19. Administration of oseltamivir or ganciclovir might be beneficial for reducing mortality in severe patients.","Liu, Jiao; Zhang, Sheng; Wu, Zhixiong; Shang, You; Dong, Xuan; Li, Guang; Zhang, Lidi; Chen, Yizhu; Ye, Xiaofei; Du, Hangxiang; Liu, Yongan; Wang, Tao; Huang, SiSi; Chen, Limin; Wen, Zhenliang; Qu, Jieming; Chen, Dechang",Ann Intensive Care,https://doi.org/10.1186/s13613-020-00706-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32737627/,696
636897,Screening for SARS-CoV-2 infections with colorimetric RT-LAMP and LAMP sequencing,2020-05-09,"BACKGROUND: Behçet's disease (BD) is a complex vasculitis with some vascular manifestations including venous thrombosis, arterial thrombosis/aneurysm/pseudoaneurysm, and co-associated venous thrombosis and arterial lesions. We present two patients with Behçet's disease came with progressive both arterial and venous involvement. CASE PRESENTATION: The first patient was a young man with recurrent oral aphthosis and skin folliculitis and referred with complaint of new abdominal pain and 2 months severe headache. He had not referred to a physician due to COVID-19 pandemic until that time. In addition, he gradually developed a lower extremity edema and eventually was diagnosed with BD complicated with brain sagittal sinus vein thrombosis, abdominal aortic aneurysms and aortitis and deep vein thrombosis (DVT) of femoral vein. The second patient was a young woman with previous history of uveitis, DVT and recurrent oral and genital aphthosis presented with a large inguinal mass due to large iliac artery pseudoaneurysm impending to rupture, and after the operation, due to poor follow-up, developed a new femoral DVT. CONCLUSION: It seems the same inflammatory process is responsible for arterial and venous involvement in patients with BD, so it should be considered that involvement in one side (venous/arterial) can be a risk factor for the other side (venous/arterial) and early immunosuppressive treatment should always be considered to improve the prognosis.","Shenavandeh, Saeedeh; Johari, Hamed Ghoddusi; Aflaki, Elham",Current rheumatology reviews (Online),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34544348/; https://doi.org/10.2174/1573397117666210920154400,696

We conducted 131 semi-structured phone interviews with households in rural Odisha, India to understand behavior changes made in WASH practices as a result of the pandemic and challenges that would prevent best practices. Interviews were conducted from May-July 2020 with 73 heads of household, 37 caregivers of children less than five years old, and 21 members of village water and sanitation committees in villages with community-level piped water and high levels of latrine ownership. The majority of respondents (86%, N=104) reported a change in their handwashing practice due to COVID-19 or the related government lockdown, typically describing an increase in handwashing frequency, more thorough washing method, and/or use of soap. These improved handwashing practices remained in place a few months after the pandemic began and were often described as a new consistent practice after additional daily actions (such as returning home), suggesting new habit formation. Few participants (13%) reported barriers to handwashing. Some respondents also detailed improvements in other WASH behaviors including village-level cleaning of water tanks and/or treatment of piped water (48% of villages), household water treatment and storage (17% of respondents), and household cleaning (41% of respondents). However, there was minimal change in latrine use and child feces management practices as a result of the pandemic. We provide detailed thematic summaries of qualitative responses to allow for richer insights into these WASH behavior changes, or lack thereof, during the pandemic. The results also highlight the importance of ensuring communities have adequate WASH infrastructure to enable the practice of safe behaviors and strengthen resilience during a large-scale health crisis.","Bauza, V.; Sclar, G.

Health is relevant to all of these agendas. Policymakers must now translate these global agendas into national level policies to implement the agreed goals in a coherent manner. However, approaches to synergise health activities within and across these agendas are needed, in order to achieve better coherence and maximise national level implementation. This research evaluated the framing of human health within these agendas. A content analysis of the agendas was conducted. Findings indicate (i) the importance of increased awareness of health systems strengthening as a helpful framework to guide the integration of health issues across the agendas, (ii) only two health themes had synergies across the agendas, (iii) the lack of a governance mechanism to support the integration of these four agendas to enable national (and sub-national) governments to more feasibly implement their ambitions, and (iv) the vital component of health leadership.

638417,The effect of SARS-CoV-2 D614G mutation on BNT162b2 vaccine-elicited neutralization,2021-03-25,"Background In early 2020, the COVID‐19 pandemic significantly altered management of surgical patients globally. International guidelines recommended that non-operative management be implemented wherever possible (e.g. in proven uncomplicated appendicitis) to reduce pressure on healthcare services and reduce risk of peri-operative viral transmission. We sought to compare our management and outcomes of appendicitis during lockdown versus a non-pandemic period. Methods All presentations to our department with a clinical diagnosis of acute appendicitis between 12/03/2020 and 30/06/2020 were compared to the same 110-day period in 2019. Quantity and severity of presentations, use of radiological investigations, rate of operative intervention and histopathological findings were variables collected for comparison. Results There was a reduction in appendicitis presentations (from 74 to 56 cases), and an increase in radiological imaging (from 70.27% to 89.29%)(P=0.007) from 2019 to 2020. In 2019, 93.24% of patients had appendicectomy, compared to 71.42% in 2020(P<0.001). This decrease was most pronounced in uncomplicated cases, whose operative rates dropped from 90.32% to 62.5%(P=0.009). Post-operative histology confirmed appendicitis in 73.9% in 2019, compared to 97.5% in 2020 (P=0.001). Normal appendiceal pathology was reported for 17 cases (24.64%) in 2019, compared to none in 2020 (P<0.001) – a 0% negative appendicectomy rate (NAR). Discussion The 0% NAR in 2020 is due to a combination of increased CT imaging, a higher threshold to operate, and is impacted by increased disease severity due to delayed patient presentation. This study adds to growing literature promoting routine use of radiological imaging to confirm appendicitis diagnosis. As we enter a second lockdown, patients should be encouraged to avoid late presentations, and surgical departments should continue using radiological imaging more liberally in guiding appendicitis management.","Somers, Kate; Elwahab, Sami Abd; Raza, Muhammad Zeeshan; O’Grady, Sorcha; DeMarchi, Joshua; Butt, Abeeda; Burke, John; Robb, William; Power, Colm; McCawley, Niamh; McNamara, Deborah; Kearney, David; Hill, Arnold DK.",Surgeon,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.surge.2021.01.009; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1479666X21000305; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33750630/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1479666X21000305?v=s5,696
638882,"Commentary for “Endocrine significance of SARS-CoV-2’s reliance on ACE2""",2020-12-03,"Data describing the clinical progression of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) in transplant recipients are limited. In New York City during the surge in COVID‐19 cases, a systematic approach to monitoring and triaging immunocompromised transplant patients was required in the context of strained healthcare resources, limited outpatient testing, and heightened hospital exposure risks. Public health guidance at the onset of the COVID‐19 outbreak recommended outpatient monitoring of mildly symptomatic patients without specific recommendations for special populations such as transplant recipients. We developed and implemented a systematic monitoring algorithm for kidney transplant recipients at our transplant center who reported mild symptoms suggestive of COVID‐19. We describe the outcomes of the first 44 patients monitored through this algorithm. A total of 44 kidney transplant recipients thought to be symptomatic for COVID‐19 disease were followed for a minimum of 14 days. The majority of mildly symptomatic patients (34/44) had clinical progression of disease and were referred to the emergency department where they all tested PCR positive and required hospitalization. More than half of these patients presented with hypoxia requiring supplemental oxygen, 39% were intubated within 48 hours, and 53% developed acute kidney injury but did not require dialysis. There were 6 deaths. During surge outbreaks, kidney transplant patients with even mild symptoms have a high likelihood of COVID‐19 disease and most will worsen requiring hospitalization for supportive measures. Earlier outpatient testing and hospitalization may improve COVID‐19 outcomes among transplant recipients.","Mehta, Sapna A.; Leonard, Jeanette; Labella, Pauline; Cartiera, Katarzyna; Soomro, Irfana; Neumann, Henry; Montgomery, Robert A.; Ali, Nicole M.",Transpl Infect Dis,https://doi.org/10.1111/tid.13383; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32578324/,696

639477,Spontaneous Tonsillar Hemorrhage in a SARS-CoV-2 Positive Male,2021-06-14,"Introduction L’infection par le SARS-CoV-2 peut mener à un syndrome de détresse respiratoire aigu dont la mortalité était estimée à 50 % au début de l’épidémie. Ces formes sévères étant significativement associées à un état d’hyperinflammation, et notamment à un niveau élevé d’interleukine-6, il a été proposé que cibler la voie de signalisation de cette interleukine majoritairement pro-inflammatoire, puisse réduire la mortalité de la COVID-19. Pour autant, un an après le début de la pandémie, la place de ces inhibiteurs, dont le Tocilizumab, un anticorps monoclonal dirigé contre le récepteur de l’interleuline-6, reste à déterminer. Patients et méthodes Cohorte exposé-non exposé en vie réelle, monocentrique et menée à l’hôpital Saint-Antoine, Paris, France, avant la mise en place de l’essai randomisé CORIMUNO-TOCI. Etaient inclus les patients de plus de 18 ans qui présentaient une forme modérée à sévère de COVID-19, selon la définition de l’OMS, et qui nécessitaient une oxygéno-requerance ≥4 L/min, associée à un syndrome inflammatoire biologique (CRP>50mg/L). Etaient exclus les patients qui portaient des contre-indications au Tocilizumab (antécédent de sigmoïdite ou de diverticulite, une cytolyse hépatique supérieure à 5N, une allergie connue au Tocilizumab, ou une infection bactérienne active.) Par ailleurs, les patients qui étaient transférés en soins intensifs dans les premières 24h après l’injection de Tocilizumab étaient exclus de notre étude, puisque ils étaient inclus dans une étude qui évaluait le Tocilizumab en réanimation. Les patients du groupe Tocilizumab recevaient une injection de 8mg/kg (maximum 800mg) de Tocilizumab associée aux soins courants et les patients du groupe soins courants ne recevaient que les soins courants. Pour assurer la comparabilité des deux groupes nous avons utilisé le score de propension. Notre critère de jugement principal était le délai de sevrage en oxygène. Les critères de jugement secondaire étaient : le transfert en soins intensifs, le besoin de ventilation mécanique, le décès toutes causes confondues, le décès au dixie jour, la durée d’hospitalisation ainsi que les scores composites intubation ou décès et transfert en soins intensifs ou décès. Résultats Cinquante patients ont été inclus dans le groupe Tocilizumab et 52 patients dans le groupe soins courants. L’âge moyen était de 68,9±2 ans et 71 % des patients étaient des hommes. Les patients du groupe Tocilizumab étaient plus fréquemment diabétique (34 % vs 13 % ; p = 0,02), et avaient un niveau d’oxygène moyen plus élevé (9,1 L/min vs 6,8 L/min ; p = 0,0002). Les patients du groupe Tocilizumab avaient reçu plus de corticoïdes que les patients du groupe soins courants (53 % vs 6 % ; p < 0,0001). Le délai de sevrage en oxygène n’était pas diffèrent dans les deux groupes, 14,1 [IQR 7-19] jours dans le groupe Tocilizumab versus 12,2 [IQR 7,5-14] jours dans le groupe soins courants, hazard ratio ajusté à 1,53 (IC95 % (0,96-2,45) ; p = 0,073). Il n’y avait pas non plus de différence concernant les critères de jugement secondaires. Discussion Dans cet essai, nous rapportons une absence de bénéfice du Tocilizumab dans les formes modérées à sévères de la COVID-19. L’injection de Tocilizumab à la posologie de 8mg/kg n’améliorait pas le délai de sevrage en oxygène, et ne réduisait pas la nécessité d’intubation, de transfert en soins intensifs ou la mortalité. Cette absence de différence peut être expliquée, en partie, par le fait que les patients du groupe Tocilizumab étaient plus graves (oxygéno-requerance plus élevée) et comorbides (plus fréquemment diabétiques). En revanche, ces patients avaient reçu plus de corticoides qui est aujourd’hui un traitement recommandé dans la prise en charge des patients sous oxygène, atteints de la COVID-19. Notre étude manque aussi de puissance, une récente méta-analyse estimait à 2300 patients (dans chaque bras) le nombre de sujet nécessaire pour mettre en évidence une différence significative si celle-ci existait. Conclusion Un essai randomisé récent qui incluait un nombre de sujet suffisant, en cours de publication, a montré des résultats encourageants, avec une diminution de la mortalité à 28jours chez les patients traités par Tocilizumab (majoritairement en associations au corticoïdes). Toutefois la question du meilleur moment de l’injection de Tocilizumab chez les patients atteints de COVID-19 reste entière.","Richier, Q.; Jachiet, V.; Carrat, F.; Abisror, N.; Jerome, P.; Marc, G.; Placais, L.; Fayand, A.; Adedjouma, A.; Gobert, D.; Riviere, S.; Chauchard, M.; Gatfosse, M.; Chopin, D.; Mahévas, T.; Morgand, M.; Meynard, J.

639819,Quantification of the spread of SARS-CoV-2 variant B.1.1.7 in Switzerland,2021-08-09,"BACKGROUND: Intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) is a rare cancer. Patients in rural areas may face reduced access to advanced treatments often only available at referral centers. We evaluated the association of referral center treatment with treatment patterns, outcomes, and geography in patients with ICC. METHODS: We queried the Oregon State Cancer Registry for ICC between 1997 and 2016, collecting clinicopathologic, demographic, and oncologic data. Patients were classified by treatment at a referral center or non-referral center. ‘Crowfly’ distance to the nearest referral center (DRC) was calculated. Outcomes were evaluated using Kaplan–Meier, Cox proportional hazards modeling, and logistic regression. RESULTS: Over 20 years, 740 patients with ICC had a median age of 66 years. Slightly more than half (n = 424, 57%) were non-referral center treated and 316 (43%) were referral center treated. Referral center treatment increased over time (odds ratio [OR] 1.03/year, p < 0.05). Referral center-treated patients had improved overall survival in all patients (median 9 vs. 4 months, p < 0.001), in the non-metastatic group (median 13 vs. 6 months, p < 0.001), and in patients not receiving liver resection (median 6 vs. 3 months, p < 0.05). On multivariable analysis, referral center-treated patients more often underwent chemotherapy, resection, or radiation (all p < 0.05). Increasing DRC (OR 0.98/20 km, p < 0.05) was independently associated with non-referral center treatment. CONCLUSION: Patients with ICC who are evaluated at a referral center are more likely to receive treatments associated with better oncologic outcomes, including patients who are not managed with hepatic resection. Increasing the DRC is associated with treatment at a non-referral center; interventions to facilitate referral, such as telemedicine, may lead to improved outcomes for patients with ICC in rural states.","Sutton, Thomas L.; Walker, Brett S.; Nabavizadeh, Nima; Grossberg, Aaron; Thomas, Charles R.; Lopez, Charles D.; Kardosh, Adel; Chen, Emerson Y.; Sheppard, Brett C.; Mayo, Skye C.",Ann Surg Oncol,https://doi.org/10.1245/s10434-021-10650-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34448960/,696

640566,Engagement with daily testing instead of self-isolating in contacts of confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2: A qualitative analysis,2021-05-25,"Unbiased metagenomic sequencing holds significant potential as a diagnostic tool for the simultaneous detection of any previously genetically described viral nucleic acids in clinical samples. Viral genome sequences can also inform on likely phenotypes including drug susceptibility or neutralization serotypes. In this study, different variables of the laboratory methods often used to generate viral metagenomics libraries on the efficiency of viral detection and virus genome coverage were compared. A biological reagent consisting of 25 different human RNA and DNA viral pathogens was used to estimate the effect of filtration and nuclease digestion, DNA/RNA extraction methods, pre-amplification and the use of different library preparation kits on the detection of viral nucleic acids. Filtration and nuclease treatment led to slight decreases in the percentage of viral sequence reads and number of viruses detected. For nucleic acid extractions silica spin columns improved viral sequence recovery relative to magnetic beads and Trizol extraction. Pre-amplification using random RT-PCR while generating more viral sequence reads resulted in detection of fewer viruses, more overlapping sequences, and lower genome coverage. The ScriptSeq library preparation method retrieved more viruses and a greater fraction of their genomes than the TruSeq and Nextera methods. Viral metagenomics sequencing was able to simultaneously detect up to 22 different viruses in the biological reagent analyzed including all those detected by qPCR. Further optimization will be required for the detection of viruses in biologically more complex samples such as tissues, blood, or feces.","Li, Linlin; Deng, Xutao; Mee, Edward T.; Collot-Teixeira, Sophie; Anderson, Rob; Schepelmann, Silke; Minor, Philip D.; Delwart, Eric",Journal of Virological Methods,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25497414/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166093414004613; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jviromet.2014.12.002; http://europepmc.org/articles/pmc4344864?pdf=render; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0166093414004613,696

In this study, computational screening is performed by molecular docking of 1615 Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved drugs against the main protease (Mpro) of SARS-CoV-2. Several promising approved drugs, including Simeprevir, Ergotamine, Bromocriptine and Tadalafil, stand out as the best candidates based on their binding energy, fitting score and noncovalent interactions at the binding sites of the receptor. All selected drugs interact with the key active site residues, including His41 and Cys145. Various noncovalent interactions including hydrogen bonding, hydrophobic interactions, pi–sulfur and pi–pi interactions appear to be dominant in drug–Mpro complexes. MD simulations are applied for the most promising drugs. Structural stability and compactness are observed for the drug–Mpro complexes. The protein shows low flexibility in both apo and holo form during MD simulations. The MM/PBSA binding free energies are also measured for the selected drugs. For pattern recognition, structural similarity and binding energy prediction, multiple linear regression (MLR) models are used for the quantitative structural–activity relationship. The binding energy predicted by MLR model shows an 82% accuracy with the binding energy determined by molecular docking.

A sensitive LC-MS/MS method was developed and validated for the simultaneous quantification of MPV and its metabolite ß-d-N4-hydroxycytidine (NHC) in human plasma and saliva. The analytes were extracted from the matrices by protein precipitation using acetonitrile. This was followed by drying and subsequently injecting the reconstituted solutions onto the column. Chromatographic separation was achieved using a polar Atlantis C(18) column with gradient elution of 1mM Ammonium acetate in water (pH4.3) and 1mM Ammonium acetate in acetonitrile. Analyte detection was conducted in negative ionisation mode using SRM. Analysis was performed using stable isotopically labelled (SIL) internal standards (IS). The m/z transitions were: MPV (328.1→126.0), NHC (258.0→125.9) and MPV-SIL (331.0→129.0), NHC-SIL (260.9→128.9). Validation was over a linear range of 2.5-5000 ng/ml for both plasma and saliva. Across four different concentrations, precision and accuracy (intra- and inter-day) were <15%; and recovery of both analytes from plasma and saliva was between 95-100% and 65-86% respectively. Clinical pharmacokinetic studies are underway utilising this method for determination of MPV and its metabolite in patients with COVID-19 infection.","Amara, Alieu; Penchala, Sujan Dilly; Else, Laura; Hale, Colin; FitzGerald, Richard; Walker, Lauren; Lyons, Rebecca; Fletcher, Tom; Khoo, Saye",J Pharm Biomed Anal,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpba.2021.114356; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34509661/,696

Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are known transmembrane PRRs existing in both invertebrates and vertebrates. Upon ligand recognition, TLRs initiate a cascade of signaling events; promote the pro-inflammatory cytokine, type I interferon, and chemokine expression; and play an essential role in the modulation of the host’s innate and adaptive immunity. Therefore, it is of great significance to improve our understanding of antimicrobial immune responses by studying the role of TLRs and their signal molecules in the host’s defense against invading microbes. This paper aims to summarize the specificity of TLRs in recognition of conserved microbial components, such as lipoprotein, lipopolysaccharide, flagella, endosomal nucleic acids, and other bioactive metabolites derived from microbes. This set of interactions helps to elucidate the immunomodulatory effect of TLRs and the signal transduction changes involved in the infectious process and provide a novel therapeutic strategy to combat microbial infections.","Xia, Pengpeng; Wu, Yunping; Lian, Siqi; Yan, Li; Meng, Xia; Duan, Qiangde; Zhu, Guoqiang",Appl Microbiol Biotechnol,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00253-021-11406-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34180006/,696

Being situated in Wuhan where the pandemic initiated enables us to conduct the longest analyses of memory T cell responses against SARS-CoV-2 in COVID-19 convalescent individuals (CIs). Magnitude and breadth of SARS-CoV-2 memory CD4 and CD8 T cell responses were heterogeneous between patients but robust responses could be detected up to 9 months post disease onset in most CIs. Loss of memory CD4 and CD8 T cell responses were observed in only 16.13% and 25.81% of CIs, respectively. Thus, the overall magnitude and breadth of memory CD4 and CD8 T cell responses were quite stable and not inversely correlated with the time from disease onset. Interestingly, the only significant decrease in the response was found for memory CD4 T cells in the first 6-month post COVID-19 disease onset. Longitudinal analyses revealed that the kinetics of SARS-CoV-2 memory CD4 and CD8 T cell responses were quite heterogenous between patients. Loss of memory CD4 T cell responses was observed more frequently in asymptomatic cases than after symptomatic COVID-19. Interestingly, the few CIs in which SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG responses disappeared showed more durable memory CD4 T cell responses than CIs who remained IgG-positive for month.

645639,Why Italian ENT physicians should be aware of SARS-CoV-2,2020-03-31,"BACKGROUND: Interventions that focus on the self-management of heart failure are vital to promoting health in patients with heart failure. Mobile health (mHealth) apps are becoming more integrated into practice to promote self-management strategies for chronic diseases, optimize care delivery, and reduce health disparities. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to explore the experience of using a self-management mHealth intervention in individuals with heart failure to inform a future mHealth intervention study. METHODS: This study used a qualitative descriptive design. Participants were enrolled in the intervention groups of a larger parent study using a mobile app related to self-management of heart failure. The purposive, convenient, criterion-based sample for this qualitative analysis comprised 10 patients who responded to phone calls and were willing to be interviewed. Inclusion criteria for the parent study were adults who were hospitalized at Nebraska Medical Center with a primary diagnosis and an episode of acute decompensated heart failure; discharged to home without services such as home health care; had access to a mobile phone; and were able to speak, hear, and understand English. RESULTS: Study participants were middle-aged (mean age 55.8, SD 12 years; range 36-73 years). They had completed a mean of 13.5 (SD 2.2) years (range 11-17 years) of education. Of the 10 participants, 6 (60%) were male. Half of them (5/10, 50%) were New York Heart Association Classification Class III patients and the other half were Class IV patients. The intervention revealed four self-management themes, including (1) I didn’t realize, and now I know; (2) It feels good to focus on my health; (3) I am the leader of my health care team; and (4) My health is improving. CONCLUSIONS: Participants who used a self-management mHealth app intervention for heart failure reported an overall positive experience. Their statements were organized into four major themes. The education provided during the study increased self-awareness and promoted self-management of their heart failure. The mHealth app supported patient empowerment, resulting in better heart failure management and improved quality of life. Participants advocated for themselves by becoming the leader of their health, especially when communicating with their health care team. Finally, the mHealth app was used by the participants as a self-management tool to assist in symptom management and improve their overall health. Future research should study symptom evaluation, medication tracking, and possibly serve as a health provider communication platform to empower individuals to be leaders in their chronic disease management.","Schmaderer, Myra; Miller, Jennifer N; Mollard, Elizabeth",JMIR Nurs,https://doi.org/10.2196/28139; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34406966/,696

647868,Rational Selection of PCR Primer/Probe Design Sites for SARS-CoV-2,2021-04-05,"BACKGROUND: All polypeptide backbones have the potential to form amyloid fibrils, which are associated with a number of degenerative disorders. However, the likelihood that amyloidosis would actually occur under physiological conditions depends largely on the amino acid composition of a protein. We explore using a naive Bayesian classifier and a weighted decision tree for predicting the amyloidogenicity of immunoglobulin sequences. RESULTS: The average accuracy based on leave-one-out (LOO) cross validation of a Bayesian classifier generated from 143 amyloidogenic sequences is 60.84%. This is consistent with the average accuracy of 61.15% for a holdout test set comprised of 103 AM and 28 non-amyloidogenic sequences. The LOO cross validation accuracy increases to 81.08% when the training set is augmented by the holdout test set. In comparison, the average classification accuracy for the holdout test set obtained using a decision tree is 78.64%. Non-amyloidogenic sequences are predicted with average LOO cross validation accuracies between 74.05% and 77.24% using the Bayesian classifier, depending on the training set size. The accuracy for the holdout test set was 89%. For the decision tree, the non-amyloidogenic prediction accuracy is 75.00%. CONCLUSIONS: This exploratory study indicates that both classification methods may be promising in providing straightforward predictions on the amyloidogenicity of a sequence. Nevertheless, the number of available sequences that satisfy the premises of this study are limited, and are consequently smaller than the ideal training set size. Increasing the size of the training set clearly increases the accuracy, and the expansion of the training set to include not only more derivatives, but more alignments, would make the method more sound. The accuracy of the classifiers may also be improved when additional factors, such as structural and physico-chemical data, are considered. The development of this type of classifier has significant applications in evaluating engineered antibodies, and may be adapted for evaluating engineered proteins in general.","David, Maria Pamela C; Concepcion, Gisela P; Padlan, Eduardo A",BMC Bioinformatics,https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2105-11-79; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20144194/,696

One of the main criteria for equitable vaccine distribution is predicting the geographic distribution of active virus at the time of vaccination. This research developed sequence-learning models to predict the behavior of the COVID-19 pandemic across the US, based on previously reported information. For this objective, we used two time-series datasets of confirmed COVID-19 cases and COVID-19 effective reproduction numbers from January 22, 2020 to November 26, 2020 for all states in the US. The datasets have 310 time-steps (days) and 50 features (US states). To avoid training the models for all states, we categorized US states on the basis of their similarity to previously reported COVID-19 behavior. For this purpose, we used an unsupervised self-organizing map to categorize all states of the US into four groups on the basis of the similarity of their effective reproduction numbers. After selecting a leading state (the state with earliest outbreaks) in each group, we developed deterministic and stochastic Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) and Mixture Density Network (MDN) models. We trained the models with data from each leading state to make predictions, then compared the models with a baseline linear regression model. We also remove seasonality and trends from a dataset of non-stationary COVID-19 cases to determine the effects on prediction. We showed that the deterministic LSTM model trained on the COVID-19 effective reproduction numbers outperforms other prediction methods.","Davahli, Mohammad Reza; Karwowski, Waldemar; Fiok, Krzysztof",PLoS One,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0253925; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34228740/,696

The effects of COVID-19–induced inflammation on cancer cells and their microenvironment are yet to be elucidated. Here, we formulate the hypothesis that COVID-19–associated inflammation may generate a microenvironment favorable to tumor cell proliferation and particularly to the reawakening of dormant cancer cells (DCCs). DCCs often survive treatment of primary tumors and populate premetastatic niches in the lungs and other organs, retaining the potential for metastatic outgrowth. DCCs reawakening may be promoted by several events associated to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, including activation of neutrophils and monocytes/macrophages, lymphopenia and an uncontrolled production of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Among pro-inflammatory factors produced during COVID-19, neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) released by activated neutrophils have been specifically shown to activate premetastatic cancer cells disseminated in the lungs, suggesting they may be involved in DCCs reawakening in COVID-19 patients. If confirmed by further studies, the links between COVID-19, DCCs reactivation and tumor relapse may support the use of specific anti-inflammatory and anti-metastatic therapies in patients with COVID-19 and an active or previous cancer.","Francescangeli, Federica; De Angelis, Maria Laura; Baiocchi, Marta; Rossi, Rachele; Biffoni, Mauro; Zeuner, Ann",Front Oncol,https://doi.org/10.3389/fonc.2020.592891; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33194755/,696
649817,Social Distancing and SARS-CoV-2 Transmission Potential Early in the Epidemic in Finland,2021-04-22,"Dengue poses a global health threat, which will persist without therapeutic intervention. Immunity induced by exposure to one serotype does not confer long-term protection against secondary infection with other serotypes and is potentially capable of enhancing this infection. Although vaccination is believed to induce durable and protective responses against all the dengue virus (DENV) serotypes in order to reduce the burden posed by this virus, the development of a safe and efficacious vaccine remains a challenge. Immunoinformatics and computational vaccinology have been utilized in studies of infectious diseases to provide insight into the host–pathogen interactions thus justifying their use in vaccine development. Since vaccination is the best bet to reduce the burden posed by DENV, this study is aimed at developing a multi-epitope based vaccines for dengue control. Combined approaches of reverse vaccinology and immunoinformatics were utilized to design multi-epitope based vaccine from the sequence of DENV. Specifically, BCPreds and IEDB servers were used to predict the B-cell and T-cell epitopes, respectively. Molecular docking was carried out using Schrödinger, PATCHDOCK and FIREDOCK. Codon optimization and in silico cloning were done using JCAT and SnapGene respectively. Finally, the efficiency and stability of the designed vaccines were assessed by an in silico immune simulation and molecular dynamic simulation, respectively. The predicted epitopes were prioritized using in-house criteria. Four candidate vaccines (DV-1–4) were designed using suitable adjuvant and linkers in addition to the shortlisted epitopes. The binding interactions of these vaccines against the receptors TLR-2, TLR-4, MHC-1 and MHC-2 show that these candidate vaccines perfectly fit into the binding domains of the receptors. In addition, DV-1 has a better binding energies of − 60.07, − 63.40, − 69.89 kcal/mol against MHC-1, TLR-2, and TLR-4, with respect to the other vaccines. All the designed vaccines were highly antigenic, soluble, non-allergenic, non-toxic, flexible, and topologically assessable. The immune simulation analysis showed that DV-1 may elicit specific immune response against dengue virus. Moreover, codon optimization and in silico cloning validated the expressions of all the designed vaccines in E. coli. Finally, the molecular dynamic study shows that DV-1 is stable with minimum RMSF against TLR4. Immunoinformatics tools are now applied to screen genomes of interest for possible vaccine target. The designed vaccine candidates may be further experimentally investigated as potential vaccines capable of providing definitive preventive measure against dengue virus infection.","Fadaka, Adewale Oluwaseun; Sibuyi, Nicole Remaliah Samantha; Martin, Darius Riziki; Goboza, Mediline; Klein, Ashwil; Madiehe, Abram Madimabe; Meyer, Mervin",Sci Rep,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-99227-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34611250/,696

650417,A recombinant ‘ACE2 Triple Decoy’ that traps and neutralizes SARS-CoV-2 shows enhanced affinity for highly transmissible SARS-CoV-2 variants,2021-03-09,"In the face of the worldwide threat of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) to human life, some of the most urgent challenges are to develop fast and accurate analytical methods for early diagnosis of this disease as well as to create a safe anti-viral vaccine for prevention. To these ends, we investigated the antigenicity of the spike protein (S protein), a major structural protein in the SARS-coronavirus (SARS-CoV). Based upon the theoretical analysis for hydrophobicity of the S protein, 18 peptides were synthesized. Using Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA), these peptides were screened in the sera from SARS patients. According to these results, two fragments of the S gene were amplified by PCR and cloned into pET-32a. Both S fragments were expressed in the BL-21 strain and further purified with an affinity chromatography. These recombinant S fragments were confirmed to have positive cross-reactions with SARS sera, either by Western blot or by ELISA. Our results demonstrated that the potential epitope regions were located at Codons 469–882 in the S protein, and one epitope site was located at Codons 599–620. Identification of antigenic regions in the SARS-CoV S protein may be important for the functional studies of this virus or the development of clinical diagnosis.","Ren, Yan; Zhou, Zhengfeng; Liu, Jinxiu; Lin, Liang; Li, Shuting; Wang, Hao; Xia, Ji; Zhao, Zhe; Wen, Jie; Zhou, Cuiqi; Wang, Jingqiang; Yin, Jianning; Xu, Ningzhi; Liu, Siqi",Genomics Proteomics Bioinformatics,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15629033/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S167202290301026X; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S167202290301026X,696

651261,On build‐up of epidemiologic models—Development of a SEI(3)RSD model for the spread of SARS‐CoV‐2,2020-10-13,"Red cell transfusion represents one of the cornerstones of the chronic management of sickle cell disease, as well as its acute complications. Automated red cell exchange can rapidly lower the number of circulating sickle erythrocytes, without causing iron overload. Here, we describe our experience, having offered this intervention since 2011. A transient reduction in the platelet count by 61% was observed after the procedure. This was not associated with any haemorrhagic complications. Despite exposure to large volumes of blood, the alloimmunisation rate was only 0.027/100 units of red cells. The absence of any iron loading was confirmed by serial Ferriscans, performed over a number of years. However, patients with advanced chronic kidney disease showed evidence of iron loading due to reduced innate haemopoiesis and were subsequently switched to simple transfusions. A total of 59% of patients were on regular automated red cell exchange with a history of recurrent painful crises. A total of 77% responded clinically, as evidenced by at least a 25% reduction in their emergency hospital attendance for pain management. The clinical response was gradual and increased the longer patients stayed on the program. The earliest sign of clinical response was a reduction in the length of stay when these patients were hospitalised, indicating that a reduction in the severity of crises precedes the reduction in their frequency. Automated red cell exchange also appeared to be beneficial for patients with recurrent leg ulcers and severe, drug resistant stuttering priapism, while patients with pulmonary hypertension showed a dramatic improvement in their symptoms as well as echocardiographic parameters.","Tsitsikas, Dimitris A.; Badle, Saket; Hall, Rhys; Meenan, John; Bello-Sanyaolu, Oloruntoyin; Orebayo, Funmilayo; Abukar, Jibril; Elmi, Mohamed; Mulla, Afsana; Dave, Shalini; Lewis, Natasha; Sharma, Manisha; Chatterjee, Basabi; Amos, Roger J.",J Clin Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33671876/; https://doi.org/10.3390/jcm10040767,696

Here, easy-to-implement CRISPR/Cas12a-based diagnostic platform through Raman transducer generated by Raman enhancement effect, term as SERS-CRISPR (S-CRISPR), are described. The S-CRISPR uses high-activity noble metallic nanoscopic materials to increase the sensitivity in the detection of nucleic acids, without amplification. This amplification-free platform, which can be performed within 30–40 min of incubation time, is then used for detection of SARS-CoV-2 derived nucleic acids in RNA extracts obtained from nasopharyngeal swab specimens (n = 112). Compared with the quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR), the sensitivity and specificity of S-CRISPR reaches 87.50% and 100%, respectively. In general, the S-CRISPR can rapidly identify the RNA of SARS-CoV-2 RNA without amplification and is a potential strategy for nucleic acid point of care test (POCT).

Phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL) is the first key enzyme of the phenylpropanoid pathway. The present study was designed to investigate whether there is a multi-gene family in I. Indigotic and, if so, to characterize their properties. We conducted a comprehensive survey on the transcription profiling database by using tBLASTn analysis. Several bioinformatics methods were employed to perform the prediction of composition and physicochemical characters. The expression levels of IiPAL genes in various tissues of I. indigotica with stress treatment were examined by quantitative real-time PCR. Protoplast transient transformation was used to observe the locations of IiPALs. IiPALs were functionally characterized by expression with pET-32a vector in Escherichia colis strain BL21 (DE3). Integration of transcripts and metabolite accumulations was used to reveal the relation between IiPALs and target compounds. An new gene (IiPAL2) was identified and both IiPALs had the conserved enzymatic active site Ala-Ser-Gly and were classified as members of dicotyledon. IiPAL1 and IiPAL2 were expressed in roots, stems, leaves, and flowers, with the highest expression levels of IiPAL1 and IiPAL2 being observed in stems and roots, respectively. The two genes responded to the exogenous elicitor in different manners. Subcellular localization experiment showed that both IiPALs were localized in the cytosol. The recombinant proteins were shown to catalyze the conversion of L-Phe to trans-cinnamic acid. Correlation analysis indicated that IiPAL1 was more close to the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites than IiPAL2. In conclusion, the present study provides a basis for the elucidation of the role of IiPALs genes in the biosynthesis of phenolic compounds, which will help further metabolic engineering to improve the accumulation of bioactive components in I. indigotica.","MA, Rui-Fang; LIU, Qian-Zi; XIAO, Ying; ZHANG, Lei; LI, Qing; YIN, Jun; CHEN, Wan-Sheng",Chinese Journal of Natural Medicines,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1875536416300978; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27914524/; https://doi.org/10.1016/s1875-5364(16)30097-8; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1875536416300978,696
652759,Evolutionary tracking of SARS-CoV-2 genetic variants highlights an intricate balance of stabilizing and destabilizing mutations,2021-06-16,"BACKGROUND: Due to COVID-19 and high demand for respirators, some healthcare professionals have been using the Halyard H600 fabric as an alternative to N95 respirators without testing the filtration efficiency of the fabric with established scientific methods. The purpose of this study was to assess the efficiency of the Halyard H600 as a respirator filtering material as compared to the NIOSH-certified N95 and P100 filters, and determine if H600 is a good alternative for respiratory protection for healthcare professionals during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Three filter types (Halyard H600, N95 and P100) were challenged with salt particles inside an exposure chamber at a flow rate of 43 LPM and relative humidity of 40±2%. N95 and P100 respirator filters were tested initially to establish the validity of the chamber, followed by the Halyard H600 fabric. Particle penetration was measured using an aerosol spectrometer. The filtration efficiency was calculated for different particle sizes by measuring the particle number concentration upstream and downstream of the filter. The pressure drop across the filter materials was measured using a manometer. RESULTS: The efficiency of the P100 for particles ≥250 nm was 100%. The N95 efficiency was 97±1% at 275 nm, 99±0% at 324 nm, and 100% for larger particles. The Halyard H600 fabric had a variable efficiency with an average of 62±28% at 275 nm, 89±8% at 324 nm, and 100% efficiency for particles >450 nm. The pressure drop values for P100 and N95 were 32 and 8 mmH(2)0, respectively. The Halyard H600 fabric resistance increased dramatically from 30 mmH(2)0 at the start of the exposure to 65 mmH(2)0 after 16-min of exposure. CONCLUSION: The high variability in filter efficiency for particles ≤324 nm and the increased fabric breathing resistance demonstrate that the Halyard H600 has an inferior performance and is not a good substitute for N95 and P100. Thus, the use of the Halyard H600 fabric for respiratory protection is not recommended.","Sousan, Sinan; Garcia, Nicole; White, Avian; Balanay, Jo Anne",Am J Infect Control,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0196655320309743; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajic.2020.11.005; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33166599/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0196655320309743?v=s5,696
652846,"Molecular Mirror Technology Facilitates High-Throughput, Accurate SARS-CoV-2 Testing",2021,"Background: The role of favipiravir as a treatment for COVID-19 is unclear, with discrepant activity against SARS-CoV-2 in vitro, concerns about teratogenicity and pill burden, and an unknown optimal dose. In Vero-E6 cells, high concentrations are needed to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication. The purpose of this analysis was to use available data to simulate intracellular pharmacokinetics of favipiravir ribofuranosyl-5'-triphosphate (FAVI-RTP) to better understand the putative applicability as a COVID-19 intervention. Methods: Previously published in vitro data for the intracellular production and elimination of FAVI-RTP in MDCK cells incubated with parent favipiravir was fitted with a mathematical model to describe the time course of intracellular FAVI-RTP concentrations as a function of incubation concentration of parent favipiravir. Parameter estimates from this model fitting were then combined with a previously published population PK model for the plasma exposure of parent favipiravir in Chinese patients with severe influenza (the modelled free plasma concentration of favipiravir substituting for in vitro incubation concentration) to predict the human intracellular FAVI-RTP pharmacokinetics. Results: In vitro FAVI-RTP data was adequately described as a function of in vitro incubation media concentrations of parent favipiravir with an empirical model, noting that the model simplifies and consolidates various processes and is used under various assumptions and within certain limits. Parameter estimates from the fittings to in vitro data predict a flatter dynamic range of peak to trough for intracellular FAVI-RTP when driven by a predicted free plasma concentration profile. Conclusion: This modelling approach has several important limitations that are discussed in the main text of the manuscript. However, the simulations indicate that despite rapid clearance of the parent drug from plasma, sufficient intracellular FAVI-RTP may be maintained across the dosing interval because of its long intracellular half-life. Population average intracellular FAVI-RTP concentrations are estimated to maintain the Km for the SARS-CoV-2 polymerase for 3 days following 800 mg BID dosing and 9 days following 1200 mg BID dosing after a 1600 mg BID loading dose on day 1.

This study aims to evaluate the use of open-source data from the epidemic observatory, EpiWATCH, to identify the early signals of pneumonia of unknown cause as a proxy for COVID-19 in Indonesia. METHODS: Using open-source data on pneumonia of unknown cause in Indonesia between 1 November 2019 and 31 March 2020 (extracted from EpiWATCH, an open-source epidemic observatory), a descriptive analysis was performed to identify the trend of pneumonia of unknown cause in Indonesia before official notification of COVID-19 cases. RESULTS: A rise in reports of pneumonia of unknown cause was identified in Indonesia, starting from late January 2020. There were 304 reported cases of pneumonia of unknown cause, 30 of which occurred before the identification of the first COVID-19 cases on 2 March 2020. The early signals of pneumonia of unknown cause in Indonesia may indicate possible unrecognized circulation of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) before official detection. DISCUSSION: Open-source data may provide rapid, unvalidated information for early detection of outbreaks. Although unvalidated, such information may be used to supplement or trigger investigation and testing.

They match the need to organize different pieces of information in a coherent and synthetic structure and constitute one of the most effective methods scientists rely on to divulge their findings. In particular, infographics provide an overview of key points regarding specific topics in a form that promotes quick learning and knowledge retention. They can be presented in printed or digital formats, being the latter particularly suitable for a global-scale diffusion via social media or websites.

Few cases of severe pulmonary disease following primary infection in both immunocompetent and immunocompromised patients were reported. OBJECTIVES: To investigate the prevalence and clinical impact of parvovirus B19 in the lower respiratory tract. STUDY DESIGN: The prevalence of parvovirus B19-DNA was evaluated by Real-Time PCR in 264 bronchoalveolar lavages (BAL) from 189 adult patients over a full-year period and related to demographic characteristics, underlying pathologies, immune status, admission to intensive care unit, mortality within 28 days, and discharge diagnosis. RESULTS: Parvovirus B19-DNA was detected in 7/189 (3.7%) patients, without significant association to demographic characteristics, immune status, transplant versus non-transplant status, admission to intensive care unit, presence of haematological conditions. In two lung transplant recipients surveillance specimens were positive to B19. Four of the remaining five patients presented respiratory insufficiency. A significant association to mortality was found, as 3/7 (42.9%) positive patients died within 28 days. No patient presented serological evidence of recent or acute infection and viremia. CONCLUSIONS: Parvovirus B19 may be detected at low frequency in BAL specimens from patients with different pathological backgrounds. This finding could be due to chronic infection with virus persistence in the lower respiratory tract, also in the absence of symptoms unequivocally attributable to B19. The high rate of mortality warrants the need for further studies to evaluate the opportunity to consider parvovirus B19 in the diagnostic work-up of lower respiratory tract infections.","Costa, Cristina; Terlizzi, Maria Elena; Solidoro, Paolo; Libertucci, Daniela; Bergallo, Massimiliano; Cavallo, Rossana",J Clin Virol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19632147/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcv.2009.06.026; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1386653209002996; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1386653209002996,696

Although COVID-19 mobile health (mHealth) apps have emerged, research on attitudes toward using COVID-19 mHealth tools among those with chronic conditions is scarce. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to examine attitudes toward COVID-19, identify determinants of COVID-19 mHealth tool use across demographic and health-related characteristics, and evaluate associations between chronic health conditions and attitudes toward using COVID-19 mHealth tools (eg, mHealth or web-based methods for tracking COVID-19 exposures, symptoms, and recommendations). METHODS: We used nationally representative data from the COVID-19 Impact Survey collected from April to June 2020 (n=10,760). Primary exposure was a history of chronic conditions, which were defined as self-reported diagnoses of cardiometabolic, respiratory, immune-related, and mental health conditions and overweight/obesity. Primary outcomes were attitudes toward COVID-19 mHealth tools, including the likelihood of using (1) a mobile phone app to track COVID-19 symptoms and receive recommendations; (2) a website to track COVID-19 symptoms, track location, and receive recommendations; and (3) an app using location data to track potential COVID-19 exposure. Outcome response options for COVID-19 mHealth tool use were extremely/very likely, moderately likely, or not too likely/not likely at all. Multinomial logistic regression was used to compare the likelihood of COVID-19 mHealth tool use between people with different chronic health conditions, with not too likely/not likely at all responses used as the reference category for each outcome. We evaluated the determinants of each COVID-19 mHealth intervention using Poisson regression. RESULTS: Of the 10,760 respondents, 21.8% of respondents were extremely/very likely to use a mobile phone app or a website to track their COVID-19 symptoms and receive recommendations. Additionally, 24.1% of respondents were extremely/very likely to use a mobile phone app to track their location and receive push notifications about whether they have been exposed to COVID-19. After adjusting for age, race/ethnicity, sex, socioeconomic status, and residence, adults with mental health conditions were the most likely to report being extremely/very or moderately likely to use each mHealth intervention compared to those without such conditions. Adults with respiratory-related chronic diseases were extremely/very (conditional odds ratio 1.16, 95% CI 1.00-1.35) and moderately likely (conditional odds ratio 1.23, 95% CI 1.04-1.45) to use a mobile phone app to track their location and receive push notifications about whether they have been exposed to COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrates that attitudes toward using COVID-19 mHealth tools vary widely across modalities (eg, web-based method vs app) and chronic health conditions. These findings may inform the adoption of long-term engagement with COVID-19 apps, which is crucial for determining their potential in reducing disparities in COVID-19 morbidity and mortality among individuals with chronic health conditions.","Camacho-Rivera, Marlene; Islam, Jessica Yasmine; Rivera, Argelis; Vidot, Denise Christina",JMIR Mhealth Uhealth,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33301415/; https://doi.org/10.2196/24693,696

COVID-19 is an infectious disease caused by SARS-CoV-2. Although RT-PCR is considered the gold standard for detection of COVID-19, CT plays an important role in the diagnosis and evaluation of the therapeutic effect of COVID-19. Diagnosis and localization of COVID-19 on CT images using deep learning can provide quantitative auxiliary information for doctors. This article proposes a novel network with multi-receptive field attention module to diagnose COVID-19 on CT images. This attention module includes three parts, a pyramid convolution module (PCM), a multi-receptive field spatial attention block (SAB), and a multi-receptive field channel attention block (CAB). The PCM can improve the diagnostic ability of the network for lesions of different sizes and shapes. The role of SAB and CAB is to focus the features extracted from the network on the lesion area to improve the ability of COVID-19 discrimination and localization. We verify the effectiveness of the proposed method on two datasets. The accuracy rate of 97.12%, specificity of 96.89%, and sensitivity of 97.21% are achieved by the proposed network on DTDB dataset provided by the Beijing Ditan Hospital Capital Medical University. Compared with other state-of-the-art attention modules, the proposed method achieves better result. As for the public COVID-19 SARS-CoV-2 dataset, 95.16% for accuracy, 95.6% for F1-score and 99.01% for AUC are obtained. The proposed network can effectively assist doctors in the diagnosis of COVID-19 CT images.","Ma, Xia; Zheng, Bingbing; Zhu, Yu; Yu, Fuli; Zhang, Rixin; Chen, Budong",Optik (Stuttg),https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0030402621007762; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33976457/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0030402621007762?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijleo.2021.167100,696

We propose a statistical learning strategy (SLS) for identifying and spatiotemporally tracking potentially relevant Spike protein mutations. We analyzed 167,893 Spike protein sequences from US COVID-19 cases (excluding 21,391 sequences from VOI/VOC strains) deposited at GISAID from January 19, 2020 to March 15, 2021. Alignment against the reference Spike protein sequence led to the identification of viral residue variants (VRVs), i.e., residues harboring a substitution compared to the reference strain. Next, generalized additive models were applied to model VRV temporal dynamics, to identify VRVs with significant and substantial dynamics (false discovery rate q-value <0.01; maximum VRV proportion > 10% on at least one day). Unsupervised learning was then applied to hierarchically organize VRVs by spatiotemporal patterns and identify VRV-haplotypes. Finally, homology modelling was performed to gain insight into potential impact of VRVs on Spike protein structure. We identified 90 VRVs, 71 of which have not previously been observed in a VOI/VOC, and 35 of which have emerged recently and are durably present. Our analysis identifies 17 VRVs ~91 days earlier than their first corresponding VOI/VOC publication. Unsupervised learning revealed eight VRV-haplotypes of 4 VRVs or more, suggesting two emerging strains (B1.1.222 and B.1.234). Structural modeling supported potential functional impact of the D1118H and L452R mutations. The SLS approach equally monitors all Spike residues over time, independently of existing phylogenic classifications, and is complementary to existing genomic surveillance methods.","Zhao, Lue Ping; Lybrand, Terry P.; Gilbert, Peter B.; Hawn, Thomas R.; Schiffer, Joshua T.; Stamatatos, Leonidas; Payne, Thomas H.; Carpp, Lindsay N.; Geraghty, Daniel E.; Jerome, Keith R.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.06.15.448495; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34159336/,696

METHODS: Data of 50 COVID-19 patients were collected in two hospitals. The clinical manifestations, laboratory examination and chest CT imaging features were analyzed, and a stratification analysis was performed according to gender and age [younger group: <50 years old, elderly group ≥50 years old]. RESULTS: Most patients had a history of epidemic exposure within 2 weeks (96%). The main clinical complaints are fever (54%) and cough (46%). In chest CT images, ground-glass opacity (GGO) is the most common feature (37/38, 97%) in abnormal CT findings, with the remaining 12 patients (12/50, 24%) presenting normal CT images. Other concomitant abnormalities include dilatation of vessels in lesion (76%), interlobular thickening (47%), adjacent pleural thickening (37%), focal consolidation (26%), nodules (16%) and honeycomb pattern (13%). The lesions were distributed in the periphery (50%) or mixed (50%). Subgroup analysis showed that there was no difference in the gender distribution of all the clinical and imaging features. Laboratory findings, interlobular thickening, honeycomb pattern and nodules demonstrated remarkable difference between younger group and elderly group. The average CT score for pulmonary involvement degree was 5.0±4.7. Correlation analysis revealed that CT score was significantly correlated with age, body temperature and days from illness onset (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 has various clinical and imaging appearances. However, it has certain characteristics that can be stratified. CT plays an important role in disease diagnosis and early intervention.","Gu, Qianbiao; Ouyang, Xin; Xie, An; Tan, Xianzheng; Liu, Jianbin; Huang, Feng; Liu, Peng",Journal of X-ray science and technology,https://doi.org/10.3233/xst-200709; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32804112/,696

Having set the scene and current challenges, it aims to suggest some strategies to overcome the issues facing dental schools going forward. Background In the US the Occupational Safety and Health Administration classified dentists in the very high risk category because of the potential for exposure to the virus as a result of aerosol generating procedures (AGP). In the last 20 years there have been two previous outbreaks of coronaviruses (severe acute respiratory syndrome and Middle East respiratory syndrome) which resulted in no long-term changes in the provision of dental education. The recent paper from Wuhan, China described action in the height of the infection but no sustainable actions to deliver dental education going forward. Challenges The challenges identified include: protecting the health of students, faculty and staff; ensuring the continuity and quality of dental education; ensuring confidence in health and safety measures; and keeping up with guidance. There is some variation across the US but most schools have suspended clinical teaching and implemented stay at home policies. Others have implemented social distancing in laboratories including clinical skills. The final challenge is ensuring that students have the teaching, experience and are assessed to ensure the competency of the graduating student. Solutions Technology in teaching and learning offers many opportunities. For didactic teaching distance learning has been implemented. There are 'off the shelf' programmes for teaching and assessment. The development of bespoke content is time consuming and one solution is for schools to share material. Although still requiring social distancing, manikins and haptics offer some opportunities for skills training. The need for excellent information sharing with faculty and students is emphasised. Conclusion Schools should re-evaluate their policies and curricula and incorporate appropriate methods of distance learning permanently into their teaching. Students should have outreach and multi-professional support in order to allow them to assist in the community during public health crises. Finally, gaps have been identified in US dental schools preparedness for pandemics.","Deery, Chris",Evid Based Dent,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32591653/; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41432-020-0089-3,696
662026,Patterns of SARS-CoV-2 Aerosol Spread in Typical Classrooms,2021-04-26,"BACKGROUND: Several SARS-CoV-2 vaccines have shown clinical efficacy against Covid-19 infection but there remains uncertainty about the immune responses elicited by different regimens. This is a particularly important question for older people who are at increased clinical risk following infection and in whom immune senescence may limit vaccine responses. The BNT162b2 mRNA and ChAdOx1 adenovirus vaccines were the first two vaccines deployed in the UK programme using an 8–12 week ‘extended interval’. OBJECTIVES: We undertook analysis of the spike-specific antibody and cellular immune response in 131 participants aged 80+ years after the second dose of ‘extended interval’ dual vaccination with either BNT162b2 mRNA (n = 54) or ChAdOx1 (n = 77) adenovirus vaccine. Blood samples were taken 2–3 weeks after second vaccine and were paired with samples taken at 5-weeks after first vaccine which have been reported previously. Antibody responses were measured using the Elecsys® electrochemiluminescence immunoassay assay and cellular responses were assessed by IFN-γ ELISpot. RESULTS: Antibody responses against spike protein became detectable in all donors following dual vaccination with either vaccine. 4 donors had evidence of previous natural infection which is known to boost vaccine responses. Within the 53 infection-naïve donors the median antibody titre was 4030 U/ml (IQR 1892–8530) following BNT162b2 dual vaccination and 1405 (IQR 469.5–2543) in the 74 patients after the ChAdOx1 vaccine (p = < 0.0001). Spike-specific T cell responses were observed in 30% and 49% of mRNA and ChAdOx1 recipients respectively and median responses were 1.4-times higher in ChAdOx1 vaccinees at 14 vs 20 spots/million respectively (p = 0.022). CONCLUSION: Dual vaccination with BNT162b2 or ChAdOx1 induces strong humoral immunity in older people following an extended interval protocol. Antibody responses are 2.9-times higher following the mRNA regimen whilst cellular responses are 1.4-times higher with the adenovirus-based vaccine. Differential patterns of immunogenicity are therefore elicited from the two vaccine platforms. It will be of interest to assess the relative stability of immune responses after these homologous vaccine regimens in order to assess the potential need for vaccine boosting. Furthermore, these findings indicate that heterologous vaccine platforms may offer the opportunity to further optimize vaccine responses.

As COVID-19 vaccines are under development, public health officials and policymakers need to create strategic vaccine-acceptance messaging to effectively control the pandemic and prevent thousands of additional deaths. METHODS: Using an online platform, we surveyed the U.S. adult population in May 2020 to understand risk perceptions about the COVID-19 pandemic, acceptance of a COVID-19 vaccine, and trust in sources of information. These factors were compared across basic demographics. FINDINGS: Of the 672 participants surveyed, 450 (67%) said they would accept a COVID-19 vaccine if it is recommended for them. Males (72%) compared to females, older adults (≥55 years; 78%) compared to younger adults, Asians (81%) compared to other racial and ethnic groups, and college and/or graduate degree holders (75%) compared to people with less than a college degree were more likely to accept the vaccine. When comparing reported influenza vaccine uptake to reported acceptance of the COVID-19 vaccine: 1) participants who did not complete high school had a very low influenza vaccine uptake (10%), while 60% of the same group said they would accept the COVID-19 vaccine; 2) unemployed participants reported lower influenza uptake and lower COVID-19 vaccine acceptance when compared to those employed or retired; and, 3) Black Americans reported lower influenza vaccine uptake and lower COVID-19 vaccine acceptance than all other racial groups reported in our study. Lastly, we identified geographic differences with Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) regions 2 (New York) and 5 (Chicago) reporting less than 50 percent COVID-19 vaccine acceptance. INTERPRETATION: Although our study found a 67% acceptance of a COVID-19 vaccine, there were noticeable demographic and geographical disparities in vaccine acceptance. Before a COVID-19 vaccine is introduced to the U.S., public health officials and policymakers must prioritize effective COVID-19 vaccine-acceptance messaging for all Americans, especially those who are most vulnerable.","Malik, Amyn A.; McFadden, SarahAnn M.; Elharake, Jad; Omer, Saad B.",EClinicalMedicine,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S258953702030239X; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32838242/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S258953702030239X; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eclinm.2020.100495,696

We employ Markov regime-switching dynamic model to explore price regime dynamics of eight widely traded commodities namely oil, natural gas, corn, soybeans, silver, gold, copper, and steel. We fit two Markov switching regimes to allow parameters to respond to both low and high volatilities. The empirical evidence shows oil, natural gas, corn, soybean, silver, gold, copper, and steel returns adjust to shocks in COVID-19 outcomes and economic policy uncertainty at varying degrees––in both low volatility and high volatility regimes. In contrast, oil and natural gas do not respond to changes in COVID-19 deaths in both regimes. The findings show most commodities are responsive to historical price in terms of demand and supply in both volatility regimes. Our findings further show a high probability that commodity prices will remain in low volatility regime than in high volatility regime––owing to COVID-19-attributed market uncertainties. These findings are useful to both investors and policymakers––as precious metals and agricultural commodities show less negative response to exogenous variables. Thus, investors and portfolio managers could use precious metals, viz.

METHODS: A multi-center retrospective study was conducted at 11 hospitals in 4 provinces of China, and COVID-19 patients with stroke were enrolled from February 24 to May 4, 2020. We analyzed epidemiological, demographic, and clinical characteristics of cases as well as the laboratory test results, treatment regimens and outcomes, and the clinical characteristics and therapeutic outcomes were compared between severe and nonsevere patients, and by age group, respectively. RESULTS: A total of 27 patients [mean age: 66.41 (SD 12.1) years] were enrolled. Among them, 9 (33.3%) were severe patients and 18 (66.7%) were nonsevere patients; 17 (63.0%) were female; 19 (70.4%) were aged 60 years and above. The most common symptoms were fever [19 (70.4%)], fatigue [12 (44.4%)] and cough [11 (40.7%)], respectively. Abnormal laboratory findings of COVID-19 patients with stroke included high levels of C-reactive protein [19 (73.1%)], D-dimer [14 (58.3%)], blood glucose [14 (53.8%)], fibrinogen [13 (50.0%)], and decreased lymphocytes [12 (44.4%)]. Comparing to nonsevere cases with stroke, severe patients with stroke were likely to be older, susceptible to receiving oxygen inhalation, and had more complications (p < 0.05). In addition, there were significant differences in lymphocytes, neutrophils, lactate dehydrogenase, C-reactive protein, creatine kinase between the severe cases and nonsevere cases (p < 0.05). The older patients had a decreased platelet count and elevated fibrinogen, compared with the younger (p < 0.05). All patients (100%) received antiviral treatment, 12 (44.4%) received antibiotics treatment, 26 (96.3%) received Traditional Chinese Medicine (Lung cleansing & detoxifying decoction), and oxygen inhalation was in 18 (66.7%).

It is generally accepted that autoantibodies against aquaporin 4 water channel protein play a pathogenic role in neuromyelitis optica. We have recently reported that plasmablasts are increased in the peripheral blood of this autoimmune disease, and are capable of producing autoantibodies against aquaporin 4. Here, we demonstrate that CD138(+)HLA-DR(+) plasmablasts, a subset of IgG-producing cells, are increased in the peripheral blood and are enriched among the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) lymphocytes during the relapse of neuromyelitis optica. Notably, these CD138(+)HLA-DR(+) plasmablasts overexpress CXCR3, whose ligands are present in the cerebrospinal fluid during the relapse of neuromyelitis optica. These results led us to speculate that plasmablasts producing anti-aquaporin 4 autoantibodies might traffic toward the central nervous system (CNS). Furthermore, we performed single-cell sorting of plasmablasts from peripheral blood and CSF samples from NMO and sequenced the complementarity-determining regions (CDRs) of the IgG heavy chain expressed by the sorted plasmablast clones. There were high frequencies of mutations in the CDRs compared with framework regions, indicating that these plasmablast clones would represent a post-germinal center B-cell lineage. Consistent with the preceding results, the plasmablast clones from the peripheral blood shared the same CDR sequences with the clones from the CSF. These results indicate that IgG-producing plasmablasts, which are guided by helper T-cells, may migrate from the peripheral blood preferentially to the CSF. Since migratory plasmablasts could be involved in the inflammatory pathology of NMO, the B-cell subset and their migration might be an attractive therapeutic target.","Chihara, Norio; Aranami, Toshimasa; Oki, Shinji; Matsuoka, Takako; Nakamura, Masakazu; Kishida, Hitaru; Yokoyama, Kazumasa; Kuroiwa, Yoshiyuki; Hattori, Nobutaka; Okamoto, Tomoko; Murata, Miho; Toda, Tatsushi; Miyake, Sachiko; Yamamura, Takashi",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24340077/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0083036,696

The biosynthetic and metabolic pathways for a core secondary metabolite in L. macranthoides, chlorogenic acid (CGA), have been elucidated in many species. However, the mechanisms of CGA biosynthesis and the related gene regulatory network in L. macranthoides are still not well understood. In this study, CGA content was quantified by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), and CGA levels differed significantly among three tissues; specifically, the CGA content in young leaves (YL) was greater than that in young stems (YS), which was greater than that in mature flowers (MF). Transcriptome analysis of L. macranthoides yielded a total of 53,533,014 clean reads (average length 90 bp) and 76,453 unigenes (average length 703 bp). A total of 3,767 unigenes were involved in biosynthesis pathways of secondary metabolites. Of these unigenes, 80 were possibly related to CGA biosynthesis.

Angiotensin II (Ang II) peptide, which has a naturally high affinity for ACE2, may be useful in inhibiting this interaction. In this study, we computationally designed several Ang II mutants to find a strong binding sequence to ACE2 receptor and examined the role of ligand substitution in the docking of native as well as mutant Ang II to the ACE2 receptor. The peptide in the ACE2-peptide complex was coordinated to zinc in the ACE2 cleft. Exploratory molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were used to measure the time-based stability of the native and mutant peptides and their receptor complexes. The MD-generated root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) values are mostly similar between the native and seven mutant peptides considered in this work, although the values for free peptides demonstrated higher variation, and often were higher in amplitude than peptides associated with the ACE2 complex. An observed lack of a strong secondary structure in the short peptides is attributed to the latter’s greater flexibility and movement. The strongest binding energies within the ACE2-peptide complexes were observed in the native Ang II and only one of its mutant variants, suggesting ACE2 cleft is designed to provide optimal binding to the native sequence. An examination of the S1 binding site on ACE2 suggests that complex formation alone with these peptides may not be sufficient to allosterically inhibit the binding of SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins. However, it opens up the potential for utilizing AngII-ACE2 binding in the future design of molecular and supramolecular structures to prevent spike protein interaction with the receptor through creation of steric hindrance.","Fatouros, Peter R.; Roy, Urmi; Sur, Shantanu",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.03.27.437352,696

However, disease flares increase the number of clinical visits. Therefore, discovering new serum biomarkers for early identification of active EGPA is crucial. Objective: To identify reliable serum biomarkers to measure EGPA activity. Methods: The expression of 160 proteins was compared in sera from 15 inactive and 13 active EGPA patients by antibody-based microarray. Network-based analysis identified patterns in the different groups. Differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) in active disease were identified, and the correlation between their serum levels and clinical parameters was assessed. DEPs were further analyzed for GO enrichment and KEGG pathways. Finally, DEP marker candidates were validated by ELISA and Bio-plex as well as against a second cohort of 22 inactive and 18 active EGPA patients. Results: The active group presented higher peripheral and sputum eosinophil counts, FeNO, and FEV1 (% predicted) (P < 0.05). Network-based analysis showed scattered expression patterns in active subjects, but no significant bias in inactive subjects. Significant differences were observed in serum levels of 19 candidate markers, all of which were higher in active EGPA (P < 0.05). KEGG analysis indicated that DEPs were mainly involved in the MAPK, PI3K-Akt, RAS and Rap1 related pathways. Nine out of 19 candidate markers were positively correlated with peripheral eosinophil counts including FGF-7, SCF, GDNF, β-NGF, IGFBP-4, Axl, PIGF, Insulin, NT-4, ErbB3, OPN and BMP-4 (r = 0.693, r = 0.692, r = 0.687, r = 0.683, r = 0.671, r = 0.606, r = 0.571, r = 0.570, r = 0.516, respectively; P < 0.05), while two, CD14 and MCP-3, were negatively correlated (r = −0.644 and r = −0.515; P < 0.05). The higher expression of Axl, OPN, HCC-4, GDNF, and MCP-3 in active EGPA subjects was confirmed by ELISA and Custom Multiplex Bio-plex analyses. Conclusion: The serum protein profiles were significantly different between active and inactive EGPA. The expression of the candidate proteins correlated with peripheral blood eosinophil count. Serum Axl, OPN, HCC-4, GDNF, and MCP-3 levels were consistently higher in active EGPA, independent of the assessment methods. Finally, Axl had the largest AUC, indicating that this cytokine may serve as novel biomarker for the diagnosis of active EGPA.","Ma, Jianjuan; Dong, Cong; Wei, Shushan; Qiu, Minzhi; Wu, Penghui; Ou, Changxing; Zhang, Bomeng; Zhang, Xueyan; Yan, Jie; Zhang, Qingling; Zhong, Nanshan",Front Mol Biosci,https://doi.org/10.3389/fmolb.2021.653461; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33987203/,696

The constant news coverage, rapid transmission, and relatively high mortality rate, make fearfulness a natural response. To assess the fear of COVID-19, the Fear of COVID-19 Scale (FCV-19S) was developed. The primary aim of the present study was to conduct the first psychometric assessment and validation of the English version of the FCV-19S. Two samples were collected in New Zealand. Sample 1 comprised 1624 participants of which 1397 completed all questions and were used in the analyses. Sample 2 comprised 1111 participants of which 1023 completed all questions and were used in the analyses. Several psychometric tests were conducted to ascertain the scale’s reliability and validity. Across both samples, the FCV-19S had high internal consistency. Consistent with the earlier validation studies, the FCV-19S displayed a moderately strong relationship with the perceived infectability and germ aversion subscales of the perceived vulnerability to disease scale (PVDS). Furthermore, FCV-19S scores were negatively correlated with the Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Wellbeing Scale (WEMWBS) scores. With respect to the motivating role of fear, there was a significant relationship between FCV-19S scores and adherence to the lockdown rules that were implemented in New Zealand. Finally, consistent with recent reports on the politicization of the COVID-19 pandemic, an exploratory question found that participants who rated themselves as more conservative tended to report lower FCV-19S scores. The English version of the COVID-19S is a sound unidimensional scale with robust psychometric properties and can be used with confidence among English-speaking populations.

Although public health experts predicted worst outcomes in Africa, the incidence, hospitalization and mortality rates have been lower in Africa compared to other continents. Interestingly, lower incidence and mortality rates have been observed in women from Africa compared to their cohorts from other continents. Also, in the US non-Hispanic Black females have lower COVID-19 and death rates compared to their white counterparts. Its unclear why this significant difference exists; however, the ovarian function, genetics and immunological statuses could play a major role. Women of African descent have elevated levels of estrogen compared with Caucasians hence we anticipate that estrogen might offer some protection against the SARS-CoV-2 infections. The racial differences in lifestyle, age and inaccessibility to contraceptive usage might also play a role. Here, we provide insight on how the high levels of estrogen in African women might contribute to the lower cases and fatalities in Africa. Specifically, estrogen might offer protection against COVID-19 by suppressing hyper-production of cytokines, promoting anti-inflammatory cytokines, stimulating antibody production and suppressing endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. This will as well provide useful information on how future pandemics could be managed using Africa as a case study.","Dufailu, Osman A.; Afriyie-Asante, Afrakoma; Gyan, Bernard; Kwabena, David Adu; Yeboah, Helena; Ntiakoh, Frank; Asare-Werehene, Meshach",J Ovarian Res,https://doi.org/10.1186/s13048-021-00820-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34020688/,696

In this paper, we develop the string grammar non-Euclidean relational fuzzy C-means (sgNERF-CM) algorithm to determine a relationship inside the data from the age, career, and month viewpoint for all provinces in Thailand for the dengue fever, influenza, and Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. The Dunn’s index is used to select the best models because of its ability to identify the compact and well-separated clusters. We compare the results of the sgNERF-CM algorithm with the string grammar relational hard C-means (sgRHCM) algorithm. In addition, their numerical counterparts, i.e., relational hard C-means (RHCM) and non-Euclidean relational fuzzy C-means (NERF-CM) algorithms are also applied in the comparison. We found that the sgNERF-CM algorithm is far better than the numerical counterparts and better than the sgRHCM algorithm in most cases. From the results, we found that the month-based dataset does not help in relationship-finding since the diseases tend to happen all year round. People from different age ranges in different regions in Thailand have different numbers of dengue fever infections. The occupations that have a higher chance to have dengue fever are student and teacher groups from the central, north-east, north, and south regions. Additionally, students in all regions, except the central region, have a high risk of dengue infection. For the influenza dataset, we found that a group of people with the age of more than 1 year to 64 years old has higher number of influenza infections in every province. Most occupations in all regions have a higher risk of infecting the influenza. For the HBV dataset, people in all regions with an age between 10 to 65 years old have a high risk in infecting the disease. In addition, only farmer and general contractor groups in all regions have high chance of infecting HBV as well.","Budwong, Apiwat; Auephanwiriyakul, Sansanee; Theera-Umpon, Nipon",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18158153; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34360446/,696

She was admitted to the medical intensive care unit with respiratory failure requiring non-invasive positive pressure ventilation. Cardiac catheterization confirmed the diagnosis of non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema. With the discontinuation of Adderall, use of BiPAP, and aggressive diuresis with loop diuretics, there was evidence of symptomatic, laboratory, and radiological improvement. Her symptoms were attributed to Adderall use as a diagnosis of exclusion. To our knowledge, this paper reports the first case of Adderall-induced non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema leading to respiratory failure. Although case reports of abuse or overdose of other stimulants such as amphetamine and cocaine leading to a plethora of cardiac and pulmonary complications such as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), cardiogenic pulmonary edema, and non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema exist, there are no reports that using Adderall at routine prescription doses can lead to these problems.","Khan, Alisha; Talha, Bilal; Vyas, Vrinda; Khan, Usman; Rao, Suman; Dhamoon, Amit",Cureus,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34395145/; https://doi.org/10.7759/cureus.16371,696

In this observational study, we investigated tocilizumab’s role in the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 and the use of interleukin-6 (IL-6) levels in the management of these patients. METHODS: Patients with positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR were prospectively observed from February 1, 2020 to May 31, 2020. Data on demographics, medical history, and clinical outcomes were collected. Tocilizumab (TCZ) 4 mg/kg/day q12h was given for 24 hours, followed by methylprednisolone 60 mg q8h for 72 hours to patients with oxygen requirement of 3 L and above. IL-6, C-reactive protein (CRP), ferritin, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and D-dimers were monitored on days: 0, 3, and 6 following the initiation of therapy. Statistical analyses were performed using a Wilcoxon signed-rank test with significance (α) less than or equal to 0.05 (P ≤ 0.05). RESULTS: A total of eighty patients (45 males, 56.96%) and (34 females, 43.04%) with positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR were included in this study. The median age was 63 (51 - 72) years. Seven patients expired (8.75%), and nine patients required mechanical ventilation (11.25%). The median of IL-6 levels before administration of TCZ was 342.50 (78.25 – 666.25) pg/mL compared to after administration of TCZ on day 3, 563 (162-783) pg/mL (P < 0.00001). On day 6, the median dropped to 545 (333.50 - 678.50) pg/mL as compared to day 3 (P = 0.709). Moreover, CRP, ferritin, LDH, and D-dimers levels were reduced following the administration of TCZ. TABLE 1: IL-6 of SARS-CoV-2 patients at before and after Tocilizumab treatment [Image: see text] TABLE 2: Laboratory findings of SARS-CoV-2 patients at before and after Tocilizumab treatment [Image: see text] CONCLUSION: Early use of TCZ may reduce the need for MV and decrease CRP, ferritin, LDH, and D-dimer levels, which may be useful inflammatory indices in the management of SARS-CoV-2 patients. Furthermore, the sequential use of methylprednisolone for 72 hours seems to potentiate the effect and prolong the suppression of the cytokine storm. The use of IL-6 levels may be helpful as a prognostic tool and in the management of acutely ill SARS-CoV-2 patients.

Using the per capita number of new cases as a proxy for the abundance of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, and the number of deaths as a measure of virulence, the dynamics of the pandemic and the outcomes emerging from it are examined for three locations (England, Italy and New York State). The data are analysed with a new version of a population dynamics model that combines exponential/logistic growth with time-varying carrying capacity, allowing predictions of persistence or extinction of the virus. In agreement with coevolutionary theory, the model suggests a transition from exponential virus growth to low abundance, coupled with reduced virulence, during colonisation of the alternate human host. The structure of the model allows a straightforward assessment of key parameters, which can be contrasted with standard epidemiological models and interpreted with respect to ecological and evolutionary processes and isolation policies.","Gillman, M.; Crokidakis, N.

Despite the numerous studies of PGRs’ post-arrival experiences, there is a major dearth of research into their pre-arrival, application experiences. Given the worldwide competition for high calibre PGRs, along with impact posed by the Covid-19 pandemic and by Brexit for the UK, it is vital for universities to ensure that factors clearly under their control, such as the information on their websites and the way they communicate, are as informative and helpful as possible. In this article, we draw on social media data to examine the challenges and uncertainties that Korean PGR applicants experienced in navigating the process of applying to UK universities. The paper compares their confusions with information available on university websites and recommends a series of points that higher education institutions should check for. It also reveals and discusses issues associated with communication. While the data has been collected from Korean social media websites, we argue that our paper has broader relevance for the following reasons. First, the same fundamental intercultural issues—different educational systems and different background knowledge—apply to PGR applicants from other countries and so their queries are likely to be similar or comparable. Second, the insights gained from social media websites to facilitate the application process and thereby enhance recruitment can usefully be applied to other countries and levels of study, in a way that has rarely been done to date.","Kim, Kyung Hye; Spencer-Oatey, Helen",High Educ (Dordr),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33903775/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s10734-021-00681-z,696

Surprisingly, few cases of Covid- 19 have been reported in people living with HIV (PLWHIV). METHODS: Here we present a series of 30 PLWHIV diagnosed for SARS-COV2 infection. The principal outcome was to describe clinical characteristics of this population. RESULTS: Eighteen (60%) patients were men, 10/30 (33,3%) women and 2/30 (6,7%) transgender women. Median age was 53,7 years (range 30-80 years) and 23/30 patients (76,7%) were born in a foreign country (out of France). The most common comorbidities were cardiovascular disease (11/30, 36,7%), hypertension (11/30, 36,7%), diabetes (9/30,30%) obesity (7/30, 23%) and chronic renal disease (5/30, 16,7%). Twenty (66,7%) patients presented overweight. Five patients (16,7%) had a Charlson comorbidity [1] score ≥3. Twenty-seven (90%) patients were virologically suppressed.CD4 count was >500 cell/mm 3 in 23/30 (76,6%) patients. An antiviral treatment for SARS-COV2 was administered, in addition to HIV treatment, in 5/30 patients (16,3%). Twenty-four patients (80%) recovered from covid-19, 3/30 (10%) required invasive mechanical ventilation, 2/30 (6,7%) patients died and 4/30 (13,3%) patients were still hospitalized.

People who have an underlying disease or taking immunosuppressive drugs are generally more likely to be infected than the others. Multiple sclerosis (MS) patients may also be at risk of the disease and its complications depending on the medication they are taking. In this study, we evaluated a large population of patients with MS with different disease modifying drugs to show if any of them increases the risk. In addition, this study evaluates the incidence of COVID-19 in patients with MS, the rate of hospitalization or death in these patients. METHOD: This study was performed at the MS Clinic of Sina Hospital. All patients were contacted and their demographic characteristics were recorded. They were then asked about their COVID-19 symptoms. Patients with these symptoms were further evaluated. The documents were reviewed by treating neurologist and MS nurses to be sure about diagnosis of COVID19. The positive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) result or compatible lung computed tomography (CT) scan was acceptable for COVID-19 diagnosis. RESULTS: 4647 patients answered the phone contact. Of these, 66 were infected with the COVID-19. The rate of hospitalization was 25% which is far more than general population. Two patients died from COVID-19. Rituximab was associated with increase rate of COVID-19 infection but not with hospitalization rate. There was no significant correlation between use of other drugs and rate of infection. CONCLUSION: This study revealed that the incidence of COVID-19 in MS patients is not more than general population, but the risk of hospitalization in these patients is higher than estimated for the disease. This highlights the importance of communicating to patients the severity of COVID-19 and the importance of risk reduction behaviors like social distancing and mask use.","Sahraian, Mohammad Ali; Azimi, Amirreza; Navardi, Samira; Ala, Sara; Moghadasi, Abdorreza Naser",Mult Scler Relat Disord,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2211034820305472; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32890817/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.msard.2020.102472; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2211034820305472?v=s5,696

HaH has been shown to improve clinical outcomes, increase patient satisfaction, and reduce hospitalization costs. Despite its effectiveness, the uptake of HaH remains slow and little is known about factors that impact the quality and transferability of HaH. This review aimed to qualitatively synthesize existing literature to examine the perspectives of stakeholders to identify areas of improvement in this model of care. METHODOLOGY: Six electronic databases (Cumulative Index of Nursing and Allied Health Literature, PubMed, Embase, PsychINFO, Scopus, and Mednar) were searched from inception date until 3 February 2021. The included studies were assessed for quality using the Critical Appraisal Skills Program tool. This review was registered on the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews. The meta-synthesis was completed according to Sandelowski and Barroso’s guidelines. RESULTS: Sixteen articles met the inclusion criteria. The overarching synthesized theme was “the intricacies of developing HaH,” and the four main themes were (1) factors influencing patient selection, (2) advantages of HaH, (3) challenges of HaH, and (4) enablers for HaH development. CONCLUSION: Overall, high levels of satisfaction were expressed by various stakeholders. Continuity of care remains an important factor for patient-centeredness in HaH. Caregivers should be involved in the decision-making process and supported throughout the HaH duration to prevent caregiver burnout. Collaboration and coordination among healthcare professionals are vital and can be strengthened through training and technological advancements of remote patient monitoring. Institutional and organizational support for stakeholders may make HaH a viable solution to modern healthcare challenges.

From a total of 210 RNA samples extracted from nasopharyngeal swabs using spin columns, the Lyo-CRISPR SARS-CoV-2 kit detected 105/105 (100%; 95% confidence interval (CI): 96.55–100) positive samples and 104/105 (99.05%; 95% CI: 94.81–99.97) negative samples that were previously tested using commercial RT-qPCR. The estimated overall Kappa index was 0.991, reflecting an almost perfect concordance level between the two diagnostic tests. An initial validation test was also performed on 30 nasopharyngeal samples collected in lysis buffer, in which the Lyo-CRISPR SARS-CoV-2 kit detected 20/21 (95.24%; 95% CI: 76.18–99.88) positive samples and 9/9 (100%; 95% CI: 66.37–100) negative samples.

688283,Reduced sensitivity of infectious SARS-CoV-2 variant B.1.617.2 to monoclonal antibodies and sera from convalescent and vaccinated individuals,2021-05-27,"BACKGROUND: The design of protein structures from scratch requires special attention to the combination of the types and lengths of the secondary structures and the loops required to build highly designable backbone structure models. However, it is difficult to predict the combinations that result in globular and protein-like conformations without simulations. In this study, we used single-chain three-helix bundles as simple models of protein tertiary structures and sought to thoroughly investigate the conditions required to construct them, starting from the identification of the typical αα-hairpin motifs. RESULTS: First, by statistical analysis of naturally occurring protein structures, we identified three αα-hairpins motifs that were specifically related to the left- and right-handedness of helix-helix packing. Second, specifying these αα-hairpins motifs as junctions, we performed sequence-independent backbone-building simulations to comparatively build single-chain three-helix bundle structures and identified the promising combinations of the length of the α-helix and αα-hairpins types that results in tight packing between the first and third α-helices. Third, using those single-chain three-helix bundle backbone structures as template structures, we designed amino acid sequences that were predicted to fold into the target topologies, which supports that the compact single-chain three-helix bundles structures that we sampled show sufficient quality to allow amino-acid sequence design. CONCLUSION: The enumeration of the dominant subsets of possible backbone structures for small single-chain three-helical bundle topologies revealed that the compact foldable structures are discontinuously and sparsely distributed in the conformational space. Additionally, although the designs have not been experimentally validated in the present research, the comprehensive set of computational structural models generated also offers protein designers the opportunity to skip building similar structures by themselves and enables them to quickly focus on building specialized designs using the prebuilt structure models.

This deep Spatio-temporal model does not only rely on historical data of the virus spread but also includes factors related to urban characteristics represented in locational and demographic data (such as population density, urban population, and fertility rate), an index that represents the governmental measures and response amid toward mitigating the outbreak (includes 13 measures such as: 1) school closing, 2) workplace closing, 3) cancelling public events, 4) close public transport, 5) public information campaigns, 6) restrictions on internal movements, 7) international travel controls, 8) fiscal measures, 9) monetary measures, 10) emergency investment in health care, 11) investment in vaccines, 12) virus testing framework, and 13) contact tracing). In addition, the introduced method learns to generate a graph to adjust the spatial dependences among different countries while forecasting the spread. We trained two models for short and long-term forecasts. The first one is trained to output one step in future with three previous timestamps of all features across the globe, whereas the second model is trained to output 10 steps in future.

Women scheduled for adnexal laparoscopic surgery for benign conditions between February and May 2019 were assigned to receive either SA or GA with endotracheal intubation. A sample size of 13 women per group was needed to detect a 2-point difference in pain scores. MAIN FINDINGS: 13 women were enrolled in the SA arm, 15 in the GA arm. In the SA cohort, the most common intraoperative adverse event was shoulder pain, reported by 3/12 women. At 1, 8, 12, 24 and 48 h after surgery pain was significantly lower in the SA arm (p < .05). Patients submitted to SA experienced no need for opioid drugs administration, unlike those receiving GA. Patients’ mobilization and return of bowel function were noted significantly earlier in the SA group (p < .05). CONCLUSIONS: SA is a feasible, safe and effective anaesthesiologic technique for laparoscopic gynaecological procedures for benign conditions, allowing a better control of postoperative pain. Women undergoing SA achieve earlier mobilization and bowel canalization. During the Covid-19 pandemics, SA could be useful in reducing the need for invasive procedures on respiratory tract.","Raimondo, Diego; Borghese, Giulia; Mastronardi, Manuela; Mabrouk, Mohamed; Salucci, Paolo; Lambertini, Agnese; Casadio, Paolo; Tonini, Claudia; Meriggiola, Maria Cristina; Arena, Alessandro; Tarozzi, Giulia; Seracchioli, Renato",J Gynecol Obstet Hum Reprod,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32426576/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jogoh.2020.101813; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2468784720301574?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2468784720301574,696
690012,Estimating the strength of selection for new SARS-CoV-2 variants,2021-04-01,"OBJECTIVES: To identify, characterise and explain factors that influence patient preferences, from the perspective of patients and clinicians, for virtual consultations in an orthopaedic rehabilitation setting. DESIGN: Qualitative study using semi-structured interviews and abductive analysis. SETTING: A physiotherapy and occupational therapy department situated within a tertiary orthopaedic centre in the UK. PARTICIPANTS: Patients who were receiving orthopaedic rehabilitation for a musculoskeletal problem. Occupational therapists, physiotherapists or therapy technicians involved in the delivery of orthopaedic rehabilitation for patients with a musculoskeletal problem. RESULTS: Twenty-two patients and 22 healthcare professionals were interviewed. The average interview length was 48 minutes. Four major factors were found to influence preference: the situation of care (the ways that patients understand and explain their clinical status, their treatment requirements and the care pathway), the expectations of care (influenced by a patients desire for contact, psychological status, previous care and perceived requirements), the demands on the patient (due to each patients respective social situation and the consequences of choice) and the capacity to allocate resources to care (these include financial, infrastructural, social and healthcare resources). CONCLUSION: This study has identified key factors that appear to influence patient preference for virtual consultations in orthopaedic rehabilitation. A conceptual model of these factors, derived from empirical data, has been developed highlighting how they combine and compete. A series of questions, based on these factors, have been developed to support identification of preferences in a clinical setting.","Gilbert, Anthony W; Jones, Jeremy; Stokes, Maria; May, Carl R",BMJ Open,https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2020-041038; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33632750/,696

SARS‐CoV‐2 can cause severe disease associated with multiple organ damage. Cancer patients have a higher risk of SARS‐CoV‐2 infection and death. While the virus uses angiotensin‐converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as the primary entry receptor, the recent experimental and clinical findings suggest that some tumor markers, including CD147 (Basigin), can provide a new entry for SARS‐CoV‐2 infection through binding to the viral spike (S) protein. In the absence of specific viral drugs, blocking of CD147 might be a way to prevent virus invasion. Identifying other target proteins is of high importance as targeting the alternative receptors for SARS‐CoV‐2 might open up a promising avenue for the treatment of COVID‐19 patients, including those who have cancer.","Xia, Pu; Dubrovska, Anna",FEBS J,https://doi.org/10.1111/febs.15499; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32738184/,696
690542,Ultrasensitive RNA biosensors for SARS-CoV-2 detection in a simple color and luminescence assay,2021-01-08,"Mathematical models of the interplay between disease dynamics and human behavioural dynamics can improve our understanding of how diseases spread when individuals adapt their behaviour in response to an epidemic. Accounting for behavioural mechanisms that determine uptake of infectious disease interventions such as vaccination and non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) can significantly alter predicted health outcomes in a population. However, most previous approaches that model interactions between human behaviour and disease dynamics have modelled behaviour of these two interventions separately. Here, we develop and analyze an agent based network model to gain insights into how behaviour toward both interventions interact adaptively with disease dynamics (and therefore, indirectly, with one another) during the course of a single epidemic where an SIRV infection spreads through a contact network. In the model, individuals decide to become vaccinated and/or practice NPIs based on perceived infection prevalence (locally or globally) and on what other individuals in the network are doing. We find that introducing adaptive NPI behaviour lowers vaccine uptake on account of behavioural feedbacks, and also decreases epidemic final size. When transmission rates are low, NPIs alone are as effective in reducing epidemic final size as NPIs and vaccination combined. Also, NPIs can compensate for delays in vaccine availability by hindering early disease spread, decreasing epidemic size significantly compared to the case where NPI behaviour does not adapt to mitigate early surges in infection prevalence. We also find that including adaptive NPI behaviour strongly mitigates the vaccine behavioural feedbacks that would otherwise result in higher vaccine uptake at lower vaccine efficacy as predicted by most previous models, and the same feedbacks cause epidemic final size to remain approximately constant across a broad range of values for vaccine efficacy. Finally, when individuals use local information about others’ behaviour and infection prevalence, instead of population-level information, infection is controlled more efficiently through ring vaccination, and this is reflected in the time evolution of pair correlations on the network. This model shows that accounting for both adaptive NPI behaviour and adaptive vaccinating behaviour regarding social effects and infection prevalence can result in qualitatively different predictions than if only one type of adaptive behaviour is modelled.","Andrews, Michael A.; Bauch, Chris T.",J Theor Biol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26829313/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jtbi.2016.01.027; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0022519316000667; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022519316000667,696
