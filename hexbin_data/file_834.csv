In order to address the situation, many countries of the world started offering different levels of educational programs. In Bangladesh, tourism education and research remain comparatively a new stream of learning opportunity. This paper instigates an exploratory study to report on the general tourism and hospitality education and research in Bangladesh. Using both primary and secondary methods, this research collects data and analyze following the content analysis technique. The findings reveal that the unique nature and interdisciplinary orientations require tourism education to accommodate both theoretical as well as practical learning modules. However, the practical part has been found largely absent in most of the tertiary level institutions. Finally, a number of issues have been identified for future research opportunities that entail the supply and demand side of tourism education and research in Bangladesh. More specifically, the findings highlighted the nature and status associated with tourism and hospitality jobs, scarcity of qualified academicians and institutes, faulty course curriculum, lack of accessibility to quality and updated materials, and failure of government to play its functional roles. This paper will be helpful for policymakers in tourism and hospitality sectors in Bangladesh.","Kabir, Karabi; Rahman, Muhammad Shoeb-Ur-",Tourism Policy and Planning in Bangladesh,834,7

Design Prospective case series assessed sinonasal QOL before and after the transnasal endoscopic approach to the sella with resection of nasal cavity and sinus tissues. Setting/Participants/Main Outcome Measures A total of 39 adults scheduled to undergo resection for a pituitary mass preoperatively completed the Sinonasal Outcome Test-22 (SNOT-22). Rating various QOL issues, testing repeated postoperatively at 1 month by 37 patients and 3 months by 35 patients, was analyzed (paired Student t test). Results SNOT-22 scores (5-point scale; total: 110) averaged 23.4 preoperatively and 27.6 at 1 month but had significantly improved to 16.2 at 3 months (p = 0.03). Emotional well-being parameters (e.g., sadness, frustration, concentration, productivity, fatigue) significantly improved 3 months postoperatively (p < 0.05). Physiologic parameters (e.g., olfaction, obstruction, postnasal drainage) that had worsened at 1 month (< 0.05) then normalized at 3 months. Conclusion Total ratings for sinonasal QOL shows that SNOT scores were comparable between preoperative and 1-month testing but were improved significantly at 3 months. Individual questions showed marked improvement in emotional well-being and temporary physiologic changes after surgery. Our findings give surgeons information about what patients can expect immediately after transnasal endoscopic pituitary surgery.","Zimmer, Lee A; Shah, Ojas; Theodosopoulos, Phillip V","Journal of neurological surgery.

METHODS We surveyed 1257 medical staff in 65 secondary and tertiary hospitals in Heilongjiang province to explore their perceptions of disaster management capacity using a cross-sectional multistage, stratified cluster sampling method. RESULTS All tertiary hospitals (100%) and most secondary hospitals (93%) have documented disaster management plans that are regularly reviewed. In secondary hospitals, drills were less prevalent (76.7%) but the occurrence of simulated training exercises was closer to tertiary hospitals (86.0%). We noted that 95.4% of all hospitals have leadership groups responsible for disaster preparedness capacity building, but only 10.8% have a stockpiled network of reserve supplies. CONCLUSIONS Although response capacity has improved in Heilongjiang Province, vulnerabilities remain. We recommend that priorities should be targeted at preparedness capacity building, in terms of reliable and relevant operational response plans, the expansion of existing response mechanisms to oversee local education and scenario training, and to ensure there is sufficient access to protective equipment and materials, either held in reserve, or alternatively by activating resilient supply chain mechanisms.

We performed a single-center retrospective study on the incidence of head and neck symptoms in 140 patients with hypermobility disorders over a 2-year period. Overall, 93 patients (66%) reported either headache or neck pain with 49 of those (53%) reporting both. Migraine (83%) was the most common headache type among those with headache disorders and cervical spondylosis (61%) the most common pathology among those with neck symptoms. Fifty-nine percent of spondylosis patients who underwent cervical facet procedures reported significant improvement in neck and head symptoms. Of patients with both head and neck complaints, 82% had both migraine and spondylosis, which, when combined with the high response rate to injections raises the possibility of cervicogenic headache. In this large multidisciplinary retrospective study of patients with hypermobility disorders, head and neck symptoms were highly prevalent, with migraine and cervical spondylosis common, often coexisting, and frequently responsive to targeted therapy for the cervical spine suggesting that degenerative spinal pathology may cause or contribute to headache symptoms in some patients with hypermobility disorders.","Malhotra, Anuj; Pace, Anna; Ruiz Maya, Tania; Colman, Rachel; Gelb, Bruce D; Mehta, Lakshmi; Kontorovich, Amy R",American journal of medical genetics.

PATIENTS AND TECHNIQUE The study involved 227 patients of reproductive age with histologically confirmed genital endometriosis (GE) of I-III degree according to ASRM classification. The control group included 12 women with no laparoscope detected gynecologic pathology. The levels of prolactin (PRL), peripheral blood (PB), and peritoneal fluid (PF) were evaluated by chemiluminescence immune assay. The pain syndrome was measured by McGill visual analogue scale. Statistica10 program (StatSoft, Inc., Tulsa, OK) was applied for obtained data processing. RESULTS A correlation was established between GE rate and levels of PRL and PB (Rs = 0.28, p < .05) as well as a correlation of PRL in PB and PF (Rs = 0.29, p < .05). Patients receiving cabergoline combined with hormone therapy standard schemes manifested considerable pain syndrome relief. CONCLUSIONS PRL involvement in GE pathogenesis and more intense therapeutic impact on pain syndrome in case of combined administration of dopamine and standard hormone therapy prove cabergoline application in clinical practice.","Yarmolinskaya, Maria; Suslova, Elena; Tkachenko, Natalia; Molotkov, Arseniy; Kogan, Igor",Gynecological endocrinology : the official journal of the International Society of Gynecological Endocrinology,834,19

Many authorities have suggested that anaesthesiologists using these monitors should interpret the raw EEG waveform seen on the anaesthesia monitor. METHODS In 34 patients anaesthetized with propofol using two doses of rocuronium (0.6 and 1.2 mg/kg), we studied whether the EMG arousal can be detected visually on the anaesthesia monitor. The Bispectral Index (BIS) and Entropy biosignals on the monitor were recorded with a video camera, and the one-channel EEG recorded by the Entropy strip was collected on a laptop computer. The recordings and the one-channel EEG were analyzed offline by two experts (anaesthesiologist and neurophysiologist), both with a long experience on anaesthesia-related EEG. RESULTS EMG arousal existed in 14/34 and 13/33 patients in the BIS and Entropy biosignals, respectively. The anaesthesiologist detected EMG on the monitor in 7/14 patients with BIS (sensitivity 50%) and in 4/13 patients with Entropy (31%). The clinical neurophysiologist detected EMG in 6/14 (43%) patients with BIS and in 5/13 (38%) with Entropy. The specificity of the EMG analyses was 55 and 65% with BIS, and 85 and 90% with Entropy. EMG arousal was detected in BIS biosignal in 10/17 and 4/17 patients with 0.6 and 1.2 mg/kg doses of rocuronium (P = 0.04). CONCLUSIONS In contrast to many EEG phenomena, EMG activity cannot be accurately detected visually from the raw EEG on the anaesthesia monitor. Further development in the quality of the anaesthesia monitors is warranted.","Aho, A J; Yli-Hankala, A; Lyytikäinen, L-P; Kamata, K; Jäntti, V",Acta anaesthesiologica Scandinavica,834,31

Ferrimicrobium acidiphilum is an actinobacterium that respires aerobically on extracellular ferrous ions at pH 1.5. In situ absorbance measurements were conducted on turbid suspensions of intact Fm. acidiphilum using an integrating cavity absorption meter designed for that purpose. Initial velocity kinetic studies monitored the appearance of product ferric ions in the presence of catalytic quantities of cells. Cell-catalyzed iron oxidation obeyed the Michaelis-Menten equation with values for KM and Vmax of 71 μM and 0.29 fmol/min/cell, respectively. Limited-turnover kinetic studies were conducted with higher concentrations of cells to detect and monitor changes in the absorbance properties of cellular redox proteins when the cells were exposed to limited quantities of soluble reduced iron. A single a-type cytochrome with reduced absorbance peaks at 448 and 605 nm was the only redox-active chromophore that was visible as the cells respired aerobically on iron. The reduced cytochrome 605 exhibited mathematical and correlational properties that were consistent with the hypothesis that oxidation of the cytochrome constituted the rate-limiting step in the aerobic respiratory process with a turnover number of 35 ± 2 s-1 Genomic and proteomic analyses showed that Fm. acidiphilum could and did express only two a-type heme copper terminal oxidases. Cytochrome 605 was associated with the terminal oxidase gene that is located between nucleotides 31090 and 33039, inclusive, in the annotated circular genome of this bacterium.IMPORTANCE The identities and functions of proteins involved in aerobic respiration on extracellular ferrous ions at acidic pH are poorly understood in the 4 phyla of Gram-positive eukaryotes and archaea where such activities occur. In situ absorbance measurements were conducted on Fm. acidiphilum as it respired on extracellular iron using an integrating cavity absorption meter that permitted accurate optical measurements in turbid suspensions of the intact bacterium under physiological conditions. The significance of these measurements is that they permitted a direct spectrophotometric examination of the extents and rates of biological electron transfer events in situ under non-invasive physiological conditions without disrupting the complexity of the live cellular environment. One thing is certain: one way to understand how a protein functions in an intact organism is to actually observe that protein as it functions in the intact organism. This paper provides an example of just such an observation.","Blake, Robert C; Guidry, Jessie J; Anthony, Micah D; Ban, Bhupal; Smith, Kayla A; Walton, Noelle N; Painter, Richard G",Applied and environmental microbiology,834,1

For some indications, like colorectal liver metastases, the amount of liver tissue left behind after liver resection has become the main limiting factor of resectability of large or multiple liver tumors. A minimal amount of functional tissue is required to avoid the severe complication of post-hepatectomy liver failure, which has high morbidity and mortality. Inducing liver growth of the prospective remnant prior to resection has become more established in liver surgery, either in the form of portal vein embolization by interventional radiologists or in the form of portal vein ligation several weeks prior to resection. Recently, it was shown that liver regeneration is more extensive and rapid, when the parenchymal transection is added to portal vein ligation in a first stage and then, after only one week of waiting, resection performed in a second stage (Associating Liver Partition and Portal vein ligation for Staged hepatectomy = ALPPS). ALPPS has rapidly become popular across the world, but has been criticized for its high perioperative mortality. The mechanism of accelerated and extensive growth induced by this procedure has not been well understood. Animal models have been developed to explore both the physiological and molecular mechanisms of accelerated liver regeneration in ALPPS.

To explore whether the furin cleavage site contributes to infection and pathogenesis, we generated a mutant SARS-CoV-2 deleting the furin cleavage site (ΔPRRA). SARS-CoV-2 ΔPRRA replicates had faster kinetics, improved fitness in Vero E6 cells, and reduced spike protein processing as compared to parental SARS-CoV-2. However, the ΔPRRA mutant had reduced replication in a human respiratory cell line and was attenuated in both hamster and K18-hACE2 transgenic mouse models of SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis. Despite reduced disease, the ΔPRRA mutant conferred protection against rechallenge with the parental SARS-CoV-2. Importantly, COVID-19 patient sera and receptor-binding domain (RBD) monoclonal antibodies had lower neutralization values against the ΔPRRA mutant versus parental SARS-CoV-2, likely due to increased particle/PFU ratio. Together, these results demonstrate a critical role for the furin cleavage site in SARS-CoV-2 infection and highlight the importance of this site in evaluating antibody neutralization activity.","Johnson, Bryan A; Xie, Xuping; Bailey, Adam L; Kalveram, Birte; Lokugamage, Kumari G; Muruato, Antonio; Zou, Jing; Zhang, Xianwen; Juelich, Terry; Smith, Jennifer K; Zhang, Lihong; Bopp, Nathen; Schindewolf, Craig; Vu, Michelle; Vanderheiden, Abigail; Winkler, Emma S; Swetnam, Daniele; Plante, Jessica A; Aguilar, Patricia; Plante, Kenneth S; Popov, Vsevolod; Lee, Benhur; Weaver, Scott C; Suthar, Mehul S; Routh, Andrew L; Ren, Ping; Ku, Zhiqiang; An, Zhiqiang; Debbink, Kari; Diamond, Michael S; Shi, Pei Yong; Freiberg, Alexander N; Menachery, Vineet D",Nature,834,27

Mandates for training organisations to reduce social contact during the global pandemic, and make learning available online, provide an opportunity for regional, rural and remote clinicians and students to more easily access learning and professional development opportunities. Online lectures, while posing an opportunity for regional, rural and remote HPE, entail potential risks. Educators who are familiar with face-to-face pedagogies may find a transition to remote, digital interaction unfamiliar, disarming, and therefore they may not design maximally engaging lectures. The strategies used in a face-to-face lecture cannot be directly transferred into the online environment. This article proposes strategies to ensure the ongoing effectiveness, efficiency and engagement of lectures transitioning from face-to-face to online delivery. Cognitive learning theory, strategies to promote learner engagement and minimise distraction, and examples of software affordances to support active learning during the lecture are proposed. This enables lecturers to navigate the challenges of lecturing in an online environment and plan fruitful online lectures during this disruptive time. These suggestions will therefore enable HPE to better meet the existing and future needs of regional, rural and remote learners who may not be able to easily access face-to-face learning upon the relaxation of social distancing measures.

The Fabaceae family comprises a large variety of species that produce substances with diverse therapeutic potential, including anti-inflammatory activity. The limitations of current anti-inflammatories generate the need to research new anti-inflammatory structures with higher efficacy as well as develop methods for screening multiple samples, reliably and ethically, to assess such therapeutic properties. OBJECTIVE Validate and apply a quantification method for prostaglandin E2 (PGE2 ) production from an ex vivo assay in human blood in order to screen anti-inflammatory activity present in many Fabaceae species extracts. METHODS Human blood was incubated with extracts from 47 Fabaceae species. After lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced inflammation, PGE2 was quantified in the plasma by liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). The extracts that presented PGE2 production inhibition were further assessed through in vivo assay and then chemically characterised through an analysis of ultra-performance liquid chromatography electrospray ionisation quadrupole time-of-flight tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-ESI-QTOF-MS2 ) data. RESULTS The new ex vivo anti-inflammatory assay showed that five out of the 47 Fabaceae species inhibited PGE2 production. Results from an in vivo assay and the metabolic profile of the active extracts supported the anti-inflammatory potential of four species. CONCLUSION The quantification method for PGE2 demonstrated fast, sensitive, precise, and accurate results. The new ex vivo anti-inflammatory assay comprised a great, reliable, and ethical approach for the screening of a large number of samples before an in vivo bioassay. Additionally, the four active extracts in both ex vivo and in vivo assays may be useful for the development of more efficient anti-inflammatory drugs.","Rosa, Welton; da Silva Domingos, Olívia; de Oliveira Salem, Paula Pio; Caldas, Ivo Santana; Murgu, Michael; Lago, João Henrique Ghilardi; Sartorelli, Patricia; Dias, Danielle Ferreira; Chagas-Paula, Daniela Aparecida; Soares, Marisi Gomes",Phytochemical analysis : PCA,834,8

This study aimed to analyze the satisfaction of patients and surgeons with the rapid expansion of telehealth at this time within the division of adult reconstructive surgery at a major urban academic tertiary hospital. METHODS A total of 334 patients underging arthroplasty of the hip or knee who completed a telemedicine visit between 30 March and 30 April 2020 were sent a 14-question survey, scored on a five-point Likert scale. Eight adult reconstructive surgeons who used telemedicine during this time were sent a separate 14-question survey at the end of the study period. Factors influencing patient satisfaction were determined using univariate and multivariate ordinal logistic regression modelling. RESULTS A total of 68 patients (20.4%) and 100% of the surgeons completed the surveys. Patients were ""Satisfied"" with their telemedicine visits (4.10/5.00 (SD 0.98)) and 19 (27.9%) would prefer telemedicine to in-person visits in the absence of COVID-19. Multivariate ordinal logistic regression modelling revealed that patients were more likely to be satisfied if their surgeon effectively responded to their questions or concerns (odds ratio (OR) 3.977; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.260 to 13.190; p = 0.019) and if their visit had a high audiovisual quality (OR 2.46; 95% CI 1.052 to 6.219; p = 0.042). Surgeons were ""Satisfied"" with their telemedicine experience (3.63/5.00 (SD 0.92)) and were ""Fairly Confident"" (4.00/5.00 (SD 0.53)) in their diagnostic accuracy despite finding the physical examinations to be only ""Slightly Effective"" (1.88/5.00 (SD 0.99)). Most adult reconstructive surgeons, seven of eight (87.5%) would continue to use telemedicine in the future. CONCLUSION Telemedicine emerged as a valuable tool during the COVID-19 pandemic. Patients undergoing arthroplasty and their surgeons were satisfied with telemedicine and see a role for its use after the pandemic. The audiovisual quality and the responsiveness of physicians to the concerns of patients determine their satisfaction. Future investigations should focus on improving the physical examination of patients through telemedicine and strategies for its widespread implementation.

The chimeric molecule X1 was a disulfide dimer, in which edge cysteine residues in the precursor molecules h1 and h2 were connected by the S-S bond. In the chimeric molecule X2, the disulfide bond was located in the middle of the molecule of each of the precursor peptides. The precursors h1 and h2 modelled amino acid sequences of α1- and α2-helices of the extracellular peptidase domain of ACE2, respectively, keeping intact most of the amino acid residues involved in the interaction with RBD. The aim of the work was to evaluate the binding efficiency of chimeric molecules and their RBD-peptides (particularly in dependence of the middle and edge methods of fixing the initial peptides h1 and h2). The proposed polypeptides and chimeric molecules were synthesized by chemical methods, purified (to 95-97% purity), and characterized by HPLC and MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. The binding of the peptides to the SARS-CoV-2 RBD was evaluated by microthermophoresis with recombinant domains corresponding in sequence to the original Chinese (GenBank ID NC_045512.2) and the British (B. 1.1.7, GISAID EPI_ISL_683466) variants. Binding to the original RBD of the Chinese variant was detected in three synthesized peptides: linear h2 and both chimeric variants. Chimeric peptides were also bound to the RBD of the British variant with micromolar constants. The antiviral activity of the proposed peptides in Vero cell culture was also evaluated.","Bibilashvili, R Sh; Sidorova, M V; Dudkina, U S; Palkeeva, M E; Molokoedov, A S; Kozlovskaya, L I; Egorov, A M; Ishmukhametov, A A; Parfyonova, Ye V",Biomeditsinskaia khimiia,834,5

In response, civic DIY volunteers explored how they could produce the required equipment. Members of communities such as hacker- and makerspaces employed their skills and tools to manufacture, for example, face shields and masks. The article discusses these civic innovation practices and their broader social implications by relating them to critical making theory. Methodologically, it is based on a digital ethnography approach, focusing on hacker and maker communities in the UK. Communities' DIY initiatives display characteristics of critical making and 'craftivism', as they assessed and counteracted politicised healthcare supply shortages. It is argued that their manufacturing activities during the COVID pandemic relate to UK austerity politics' effects on healthcare and government failure to ensure medical crisis supplies. Facilitated by open source design, communities' innovation enabled healthcare emergency equipment. At the same time, their DIY manufacturing raises practical as well as ethical issues concerning, among other things, efficacy and safety of use.","Richterich, Annika",Health sociology review : the journal of the Health Section of the Australian Sociological Association,834,1

Orphan GPCRs, which have unknown endogenous ligands, are considered drug targets and consequently have attracted great interest in identifying their endogenous cognate ligands for deorphanization. However, additional studies have shown that GPCRs, including many orphan GPCRs, can constitutively activate G protein signaling in a ligand-independent manner. GPR39 is such an orphan GPCR with constitutive activity. Here, we performed a phylogenetic and selection analysis of GPR39 in vertebrates, and we found that GPR39 underwent positive selection in different branches of vertebrates. Using luciferase reporter assays, we demonstrated that human, frog and chicken GPR39 can constitutively activate Gq and G12 signaling pathways in a ligand-independent manner. Zebrafish GPR39 can constitutively activate Gs, Gq and G12 signaling pathways in a ligand-independent manner. We further found that the zebrafish-H2967.35 site is crucial for the activity of the Gs signaling pathway. In addition, our mutagenesis studies indicated that the positive selection sites of GPR39 from different species had important effects on the constitutive activity of the receptor. Our results revealed the adaptive evolution of GPR39 in diverse directions, which led to differences in constitutive activity.","Zhang, Lina; Song, Jingjing; Zang, Zhuqing; Tang, Huihao; Li, Wei; Lai, Shanshan; Deng, Cheng",General and comparative endocrinology,834,27

Ping Feng Qingfei Mixture (PFQF) is effective in treating AHR caused by PM2.5. As there is a lack of knowledge regarding the mechanisms of PFQF in the treatment of AHR, we conducted a network pharmacology study to clarify this issue. METHODS We obtained the composition of PFQF from the traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) systems pharmacology database and its potential targets. The potential targets of AHR were obtained from the Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man and Gene Cards databases. Then psychophysiological interaction, KEGG pathway, and Gene Ontology biological process analyses were carried out for targeting PFQF in treating AHR. We further constructed a related network diagram and verified the experimental results in molecular docking. RESULTS We identified a total of 4 core active compounds, and through KEGG analysis obtained multiple signaling pathways, including T helper17 (Th17) cell differentiation and interleukin-17 (IL-17) signaling pathway. Our molecular docking also verified that PFQF could effectively regulate the imbalance of Th17-T regulatory (Treg) cells. CONCLUSIONS PFQF can effectively treat the AHR caused by PM2.5 through Th17-Treg immune balance. The combination of molecular docking and network pharmacology provides a way to elucidate the complex mechanism of action of this Chinese herbal medicine.","Wang, Min; Peng, Min; Shi, Hongshuo; Dong, Chengda; Cui, Lujie; Chang, Hui; Kan, Zunqi; Zhen, Kun; Si, Guomin; Li, Hui",Annals of palliative medicine,834,31

METHODS Over a period of 56 months, all consecutive patients who underwent SG were documented in this prospective, single-center, observational study. The study endpoints included complication rates, nutritional deficiencies and percentage of excess weight loss (%EWL). RESULTS From September 26, 2005 to May 28, 2009, 100 patients (female: male = 59:41) with a mean age of 43.6 years (range: 22-64) and a preoperative BMI of 52.3 kg/² (range: 36-77) underwent SG. The mean operative time was 86.4 min (range: 35-275). Major complications were observed in 8.0 % of the patients. During the follow-up period, 25 patients (25.0 %) underwent a second bariatric intervention (22 DS and 3 RYGBP). Out of the total 100 patients, 48 % were supplemented with iron, 33 % with zinc, 34 % with a combination of calcium carbonate and cholecalciferol, 24 % with vitamin D, 42 % with vitamin B12 and 40 % with folic acid. The patients who received only a SG (n = 75) had %EWL of 53.6, 65.8 and 62.6 % after 6, 12 and 24 months, respectively. CONCLUSIONS SG is a highly effective bariatric intervention for morbidly obese patients. Nutritional deficiencies resulting from the procedure can be detected by routine nutritional screening.

Two strategies (postlabeling and prelabeling) were explored using the isothiocyanate-functionalized DPA to determine the effectiveness of assembly on the overall yield and purity of the complex with amine containing biomolecules. A model amino acid (lysine) examined (1) amine conjugation of isothiocyanate-functionalized DPA followed by complexation with fac-[M(I)(CO)3](+) (postlabeling) and (2) complexation of fac-[M(I)(CO)3](+) with isothiocyanate-functionalized DPA followed by amine conjugation (prelabeling). Conducted with stable Re and radioactive (99m)Tc analogs, both strategies formed the product in good to excellent yields under macroscopic and radiotracer concentrations. A synthetic peptide (AE105) which targets an emerging biomarker in CaP prognosis, urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor (uPAR), was also explored using the isothiocyanate-functionalized DPA strategy.

PATIENTS AND METHODS In a prospective study, all IBD patients followed at our referral centre between May 27th and July 21st, 2020 and fulfilling the inclusion criteria were tested for SARS-CoV-2 IgG. Specific IgG antibodies were evaluated by a commercial ELISA kit and SARS-CoV-2 nasopharyngeal swab was performed in seropositive patients. RESULTS Two-hundred and eighteen patients, 128 Crohn's disease (CD) and 90 Ulcerative colitis (UC) [age 44, (19-77) years; ongoing biologics in 115 (52.7%)] were enrolled. No patient had major SARS-CoV-2-related symptoms. SARS-CoV-2 IgG were detected in 3 out of 218 (1.37%) patients with IBD (2 CD and 1 UC), all on biologics (2.6%).

It requires only a few steps to obtain information, and there are plenty of libraries that can help in this regard. Nonetheless, knowing whether a particular event is expressed on Twitter is a challenging task that requires a considerable collection of tweets. This proposal aims to facilitate, a researcher interested in Twitter data, the process of mining events on Twitter. The events could be related to natural disasters, health issues, people's mobility, among other studies that can be pursued with the library proposed. Different applications are presented in this contribution to illustrate the library's capabilities, starting from an exploratory analysis of the topics discovered in tweets, following it by studying the similarity among dialects of the Spanish language, and complementing it with a mobility report on different countries. In summary, the Python library presented retrieves a plethora of information processed from Twitter (since December 2015) in terms of words, bigrams of words, and their frequencies by day for Arabic, English, Spanish, and Russian languages. Finally, the mobility information considered is related to the number of travels among locations for more than 245 countries or territories.","Graff, Mario; Moctezuma, Daniela; Miranda-Jim'enez, Sabino; Tellez, Eric S.",,834,24

The IgG format with bivalent binding sites has a modular structure with different biological roles, i.e., effector and binding functions, in different domains. We demonstrated the reconstruction of an IgG-like domain structure in vitro by protein ligation using protein trans-splicing. We produced various binding domains to replace the binding domain of IgG from Escherichia coli and the Fc domain of human IgG from Brevibacillus choshinensis as split-intein fusions. We showed that in vitro protein ligation could produce various Fc-fusions at the N-terminus in vitro from the independently produced domains from different organisms. We thus propose an off-the-shelf approach for the combinatorial production of Fc fusions in vitro with several distinct binding domains, particularly from naturally occurring binding domains. Antiviral lectins from algae are known to inhibit virus entry of HIV and SARS coronavirus. We demonstrated that a lectin could be fused with the Fc-domain in vitro by protein ligation, producing an IgG-like molecule as a ""lectibody"". Such an Fc-fusion could be produced in vitro by this approach, which could be an attractive method for developing potential therapeutic agents against rapidly emerging infectious diseases like SARS coronavirus without any genetic fusion and expression optimization.","Jaakkonen, Anniina; Volkmann, Gerrit; Iwaï, Hideo",,834,23

Developing deep learning methods on EHRs data is critical for personalized treatment, precise diagnosis and medical management. However, it is challenging to directly use deep learning models for ISMTS data. On the one hand, ISMTS data has the intra-series and inter-series relations. Both the local and global structures should be considered. On the other hand, methods should consider the trade-off between task accuracy and model complexity and remain generality and interpretability. So far, many existing works have tried to solve the above problems and have achieved good results. In this paper, we review these deep learning methods from the perspectives of technology and task. Under the technology-driven perspective, we summarize them into two categories - missing data-based methods and raw data-based methods. Under the task-driven perspective, we also summarize them into two categories - data imputation-oriented and downstream task-oriented.

To directly test whether such “special reservoirs” of zoonoses exist, we used literature searches to construct the largest existing dataset of virus–reservoir relationships, consisting of the avian and mammalian reservoir hosts of 415 RNA and DNA viruses along with their histories of human infection. Reservoir host effects on the propensity of viruses to have been reported as infecting humans were rare and when present were restricted to one or two viral families. The data instead support a largely host-neutral explanation for the distribution of human-infecting viruses across the animal orders studied. After controlling for higher baseline viral richness in mammals versus birds, the observed number of zoonoses per animal order increased as a function of their species richness. Animal orders of established importance as zoonotic reservoirs including bats and rodents were unexceptional, maintaining numbers of zoonoses that closely matched expectations for mammalian groups of their size. Our findings show that variation in the frequency of zoonoses among animal orders can be explained without invoking special ecological or immunological relationships between hosts and viruses, pointing to a need to reconsider current approaches aimed at finding and predicting novel zoonoses.","Mollentze, Nardus; Streicker, Daniel G.",Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,834,28

Behind the picture itself, every digital image contains a wealth of quantitative data, which are hardly analysed in current routine clinical practice and this is now being transformed by radiomics. Mathematical analyses of these data using novel techniques, such as vascular morphometry (including vascular tortuosity and vascular volumes), blood flow imaging (including quantitative lung perfusion and computational flow dynamics), and artificial intelligence, are opening a window on the complex pathophysiology and structure–function relationships of pulmonary vascular diseases. They have the potential to make dramatic alterations to how clinicians investigate the pulmonary circulation, with the consequences of more rapid diagnosis and a reduction in the need for invasive procedures in the future. Applied to multimodality imaging, they can provide new information to improve disease characterization and increase diagnostic accuracy. These new technologies may be used as sophisticated biomarkers for risk prediction modelling of prognosis and for optimising the long-term management of pulmonary circulatory diseases. These innovative techniques will require evaluation in clinical trials and may in themselves serve as successful surrogate end points in trials in the years to come.","Gopalan, Deepa; Gibbs, J.

A Case Report,16.387989,13.442064,2021-04-14,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection is currently a global pandemic, and there are limited laboratory studies targeting pathogen resistance. This study aimed to investigate the effect of selected disinfection products and methods on the inactivation of SARS-CoV-2 in the laboratory. We used quantitative suspension testing to evaluate the effectiveness of the disinfectant/method. Available chlorine of 250 mg/L, 500 mg/L, and 1000 mg/L required 20 min, 5 min, and 0.5 min to inactivate SARS-CoV-2, respectively. A 600-fold dilution of 17% concentration of di-N-decyl dimethyl ammonium bromide (283 mg/L) and the same concentration of di-N-decyl dimethyl ammonium chloride required only 0.5 min to inactivate the virus efficiently. At 30% concentration for 1 min and 40% and above for 0.5 min, ethanol could efficiently inactivate SARS-CoV-2. Heat takes approximately 30 min at 56 °C, 10 min above 70 °C, or 5 min above 90 °C to inactivate the virus. The chlorinated disinfectants, Di-N-decyl dimethyl ammonium bromide/chloride, ethanol, and heat could effectively inactivate SARS-CoV-2 in the laboratory test. The response of SARS-CoV-2 to disinfectants is very similar to that of SARS-CoV.","Xiling, Guo; Yin, Chen; Ling, Wang; Xiaosong, Wu; Jingjing, Fan; Fang, Li; Xiaoyan, Zeng; Yiyue, Ge; Ying, Chi; Lunbiao, Cui; Liubo, Zhang; Hong, Sun; Yan, Xu",Sci Rep,834,1

The COVID-19 epidemic started to gain traction in France in March 2020. Sub-national hospital admissions and deaths were then recorded daily and served as the main policy indicators. Concurrently, mobile phone positioning data have been curated to determine the frequency of users being colocalized within a given distance. Contrarily to individual tracking data, these can provide a proxy of human contact networks between subnational administrative units. MethodsMotivated by numerous studies correlating human mobility data and disease incidence, we developed predictive time series models of hospital incidence between July 2020 and April 2021. We added human contact network analytics such as clustering coefficients, contact network strength, null links or curvature as regressors. FindingsWe found that predictions can be improved substantially (more than [Formula: see text]) both at the national and sub-national for up to two weeks. Our sub-national analysis also revealed the importance of spatial structure, as incidence in colocalized administrative units improved predictions. This original application of network analytics from co-localisation data to epidemic spread opens new perspectives for epidemics forecasting and public health.","Selinger, Christian; Choisy, Marc; Alizon, Samuel",Int J Infect Dis,834,26

The studies that apply artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) methods for various purposes against the COVID-19 outbreak have increased because of their significant advantages. Although AI/ML applications provide satisfactory solutions to COVID-19 disease, these solutions can have a wide diversity. This increase in the number of AI/ML studies and diversity in solutions can confuse deciding which AI/ML technique is suitable for which COVID-19 purposes. Because there is no comprehensive review study, this study systematically analyzes and summarizes related studies. A research methodology has been proposed to conduct the systematic literature review for framing the research questions, searching criteria and relevant data extraction. Finally, 264 studies were taken into account after following inclusion and exclusion criteria. This research can be regarded as a key element for epidemic and transmission prediction, diagnosis and detection, and drug/vaccine development. Six research questions are explored with 50 AI/ML approaches in COVID-19, 8 AI/ML methods for patient outcome prediction, 14 AI/ML techniques in disease predictions, along with five AI/ML methods for risk assessment of COVID-19.

Early on, chest computed tomography was used for screening and diagnosis of COVID-19; however, it is now indicated for high-risk patients, those with severe disease, or in areas where polymerase chain reaction testing is sparsely available. Chest radiography is now utilized mainly for monitoring disease progression in hospitalized patients showing signs of worsening clinical status. Additionally, many challenges at the operational level have been overcome within the field of radiology throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. The use of teleradiology and virtual care clinics greatly enhanced our ability to socially distance and both are likely to remain important mediums for diagnostic imaging delivery and patient care. Opportunities to better utilize of imaging for detection of extrapulmonary manifestations and complications of COVID-19 disease will continue to arise as a more detailed understanding of the pathophysiology of the virus continues to be uncovered and identification of predisposing risk factors for complication development continue to be better understood. Furthermore, unidentified advancements in areas such as standardized imaging reporting, point-of-care ultrasound, and artificial intelligence offer exciting discovery pathways that will inevitably lead to improved care for patients with COVID-19.","Pezzutti, Dante L; Wadhwa, Vibhor; Makary, Mina S",World J Radiol,834,3

Pointers for future research?,16.195852,13.841611,2020-08-29,"The disease caused by the new type of coronavirus, Covid-19, has posed major public health challenges for many countries. With its rapid spread, since the beginning of the outbreak in December 2019, the disease transmitted by SARS-CoV-2 has already caused over 2 million deaths to date. In this work, we propose a web solution, called Heg.IA, to optimize the diagnosis of Covid-19 through the use of artificial intelligence. Our system aims to support decision-making regarding to diagnosis of Covid-19 and to the indication of hospitalization on regular ward, semi-ICU or ICU based on decision a Random Forest architecture with 90 trees. The main idea is that healthcare professionals can insert 41 hematological parameters from common blood tests and arterial gasometry into the system. Then, Heg.IA will provide a diagnostic report. The system reached good results for both Covid-19 diagnosis and to recommend hospitalization. For the first scenario we found average results of accuracy of 92.891%±0.851, kappa index of 0.858 ± 0.017, sensitivity of 0.936 ± 0.011, precision of 0.923 ± 0.011, specificity of 0.921 ± 0.012 and area under ROC of 0.984 ± 0.003. As for the indication of hospitalization, we achieved excellent performance of accuracies above 99% and more than 0.99 for the other metrics in all situations. By using a computationally simple method, based on the classical decision trees, we were able to achieve high diagnosis performance. Heg.IA system may be a way to overcome the testing unavailability in the context of Covid-19. Communicated by Ramaswamy H.
