455,455,455,The calculation of information and organismal complexity,14.511639,5.76321,2010-10-12,"BACKGROUND: It is difficult to measure precisely the phenotypic complexity of living organisms. Here we propose a method to calculate the minimal amount of genomic information needed to construct organism (effective information) as a measure of organismal complexity, by using permutation and combination formulas and Shannon's information concept. RESULTS: The results demonstrate that the calculated information correlates quite well with the intuitive organismal phenotypic complexity defined by traditional taxonomy and evolutionary theory. From viruses to human beings, the effective information gradually increases, from thousands of bits to hundreds of millions of bits. The simpler the organism is, the less the information; the more complex the organism, the more the information. About 13% of human genome is estimated as effective information or functional sequence. CONCLUSIONS: The effective information can be used as a quantitative measure of phenotypic complexity of living organisms and also as an estimate of functional fraction of genome.

Metagenomic assays designed to perform these tasks will have to include rapid and economical processing of large numbers of samples, supported by straightforward data analysis pipeline and flexible sample preparation options for multiple input tissue types from individual patients, mammals, or environmental samples. To meet these requirements, the PathoChip platform was developed by targeting viral, prokaryotic, and eukaryotic genomes with multiple DNA probes in a microarray format that can be combined with a variety of upstream sample preparation protocols and downstream data analysis. PathoChip screening of DNA plus RNA from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tumor tissues demonstrated the utility of this platform, and the detection of oncogenic viruses was validated using independent PCR and deep sequencing methods. These studies demonstrate the use of the PathoChip technology combined with PCR and deep sequencing as a valuable strategy for detecting the presence of pathogens in human cancers and other diseases.","Baldwin, Don A.; Feldman, Michael; Alwine, James C.; Robertson, Erle S.",mBio,188,1

In spite of this, little is known about the developmental alteration from its appearance to the time of hatching. In the current study the CAM has been studied by classical stereology and allometry. Expression levels of selected angiogenesis-related molecules were estimated by RT-PCR and cell dynamics assessed by proliferation and apoptosis assays. Absolute CAM volume increased from a low of 0.47 ± 0.11 cm(3) at embryonic day 8 (E8) to a high of 2.05 ± 0.27 cm(3) at E18, and then decreased to 1.6 ± 0.47 cm(3) at E20. On allometric analysis, three growth phases were identifiable. Between E8-13 (phase I), the CAM grew fastest; moderately in phase II (E13-18) but was regressing in phase III (E18-20). The chorion, the mesenchyme and the allantoic layers grew fastest in phase I, but moderately in phase II. The mesenchyme grew slowly in phase III while the chorion and allantois were regressing. Chorionic cell volume increased fastest in phase I and was regressing in phase III. Chorionic capillaries grew steadily in phase I and II but regressed in phase III. Both the chorion and the allantois grew by intrinsic cell proliferation as well as recruitment of cells from the mesenchyme. Cell proliferation was prominent in the allantois and chorion early during development, declined after E17 and apoptosis started mainly in the chorion from E14. VEGFR2 expression peaked at E11 and declined steadily towards E20, VEGF peaked at E13 and E20 while HIF 1α had a peak at E11 and E20. Studies targeting CAM growth and angiogenesis need to take these growth phases into consideration","Makanya, Andrew Ndegwa; Dimova, Ivanka; Koller, Tobias; Styp-Rekowska, Beata; Djonov, Valentin",PLoS One,188,1

In the past decade, research in this field has advanced substantially, from the understanding of the biology and immunology of pregnancy and early life, to the active development of several candidate vaccines, for which challenges and opportunities for global implementation are under consideration. Experts from academia, industry, regulatory and funding agencies, public health, and international organizations met in Brussels (Belgium) from 10 to 12 September 2017, at the 4th International Neonatal and Maternal Immunization Symposium (INMIS), to review the most relevant advances in maternal and neonatal immunization. The overarching focus of the conference was to identify the path forward to achieve integration of maternal and early life immunization strategies for the successful implementation of vaccines in antenatal care and pediatric programs for reduction of maternal and infant mortality worldwide.

3809,3809,3809,Targeted Versus Continuous Delivery of Volatile Anesthetics During Cholinergic Bronchoconstriction,14.405394,6.1505704,2018-05-09,"Volatile anesthetics have been shown to reduce lung resistance through dilation of constricted airways. In this study, we hypothesized that diffusion of inhaled anesthetics from airway lumen to smooth muscle would yield significant bronchodilation in vivo, and systemic recirculation would not be necessary to reduce lung resistance (R(L)) and elastance (E(L)) during sustained bronchoconstriction. To test this hypothesis, we designed a delivery system for precise timing of inhaled volatile anesthetics during the course of a positive pressure breath. We compared changes in R(L), E(L), and anatomic dead space (V(D)) in canines (N = 5) during pharmacologically induced bronchoconstriction with intravenous methacholine, and following treatments with: (1) targeted anesthetic delivery to V(D) and (2) continuous anesthetic delivery throughout inspiration. Both sevoflurane and isoflurane were used during each delivery regimen. Compared to continuous delivery, targeted delivery resulted in significantly lower doses of delivered anesthetic and decreased end-expiratory concentrations. However, we did not detect significant reductions in R(L) or E(L) for either anesthetic delivery regimen. This lack of response may have resulted from an insufficient dose of the anesthetic to cause bronchodilation, or from the preferential distribution of air flow with inhaled anesthetic delivery to less constricted, unobstructed regions of the lung, thereby enhancing airway heterogeneity and increasing apparent R(L) and E(L).","Mondoñedo, Jarred R.; McNeil, John S.; Herrmann, Jacob; Simon, Brett A.; Kaczka, David W.",J Eng Sci Med Diagn Ther,188,22

In these assays, acacetin had consistently higher IC(50) values than isoginkgetin. Subsequently, the acacetin was incubated with 4-methoxy-2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-1-oxy radicals (4-methoxy-TEMPO) and then analyzed by ultra-performance liquid chromatography coupled with electrospray ionization quadrupole time-of-flight tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC−ESI−Q−TOF−MS) technology. The results of the UHPLC−ESI−Q−TOF−MS analysis suggested the presence of a dimer with m/z 565, 550, 413, 389, 374, 345, 330, and 283 peaks. By comparison, standard isoginkgetin yielded peaks at m/z 565, 533, 518, 489, 401, 389, 374, and 151 in the mass spectra. Based on these experimental data, MS interpretation, and the relevant literature, we concluded that isoginkgetin had higher electron transfer potential than its monomer because of the 3′,8″-dimerization. Additionally, acacetin can produce a dimer during its antioxidant process; however, the dimer is not isoginkgetin.","Li, Xican; Ouyang, Xiaojian; Cai, Rongxin; Chen, Dongfeng",Molecules,188,1
4031,4031,4031,Viral Long-Term Evolutionary Strategies Favor Stability over Proliferation,14.27329,6.123632,2019-07-24,"Viruses are known to have some of the highest and most diverse mutation rates found in any biological replicator, with single-stranded (ss) RNA viruses evolving the fastest, and double-stranded (ds) DNA viruses having rates approaching those of bacteria. As mutation rates are tightly and negatively correlated with genome size, selection is a clear driver of viral evolution. However, the role of intragenomic interactions as drivers of viral evolution is still unclear. To understand how these two processes affect the long-term evolution of viruses infecting humans, we comprehensively analyzed ssRNA, ssDNA, dsRNA, and dsDNA viruses, to find which virus types and which functions show evidence for episodic diversifying selection and correlated evolution. We show that selection mostly affects single stranded viruses, that correlated evolution is more prevalent in DNA viruses, and that both processes, taken independently, mostly affect viral replication. However, the genes that are jointly affected by both processes are involved in key aspects of their life cycle, favoring viral stability over proliferation. We further show that both evolutionary processes are intimately linked at the amino acid level, which suggests that it is the joint action of selection and correlated evolution, and not just selection, that shapes the evolutionary trajectories of viruses—and possibly of their epidemiological potential.","Aris-Brosou, Stéphane; Parent, Louis; Ibeh, Neke",Viruses,188,1

It is a fatal disease without early diagnosis and treatment; thus, the availability of affordable diagnostic tools is crucial. However, due to delays caused by import regulations, procurement and late delivery of imported test kits, accessibility remains a problem in the control program. Therefore, we aimed to produce and evaluate the performance of an in-house liquid (AQ) direct agglutination test (DAT) antigen. RESULT: The AQ-DAT was produced at the Armauer Hansen Research Institute, using Leishmania donovani strain (MHOM/ET/67/L82). Sera from 272 participants; 110 microscopically confirmed cases of VL, 76 apparently healthy and 86 patients who had infectious disease other than VL were tested with AQ-DAT, and standard kits: Freeze-dried DAT (FD-DAT) and rK39. Taking microscopy as a gold standard; the sensitivity and specificity of the AQ-DAT were 97.3 and 98.8%, respectively. It had high degrees of agreement (k > 0.8), with a significant (P < 0.05) correlation compared to microscopy, FD-DAT, and rK39. CONCLUSION: Although further standardization is required, the in-house AQ-DAT could improve diagnostic accessibility, minimize intermittent stock outs and strengthen the national VL control program.","Ayelign, Birhanu; Jemal, Mohammedamin; Negash, Markos; Genetu, Meaza; Wondmagegn, Tadelo; Zeleke, Ayalew Jejaw; Worku, Ligabaw; Bayih, Abebe Genetu; Shumie, Girma; Behaksra, Sinknesh Wolde; Fenta, Tiruwork; Damte, Demekech; Yeshanew, Arega; Gadisa, Endalamaw",BMC Microbiol,188,1

Here, we assessed spinal cord autoregulation under normal, hypovolemic, and post-fluid resuscitation conditions compared with cerebral autoregulation. METHODS: Ten pigs (36.1 ± 1.1 kg) were anesthetized with 2.5% isoflurane, before phenylephrine administration at 0.5, 1, 2, and 5 μg kg(−1) min(−1) in a stepwise fashion at 10-min intervals (baseline), followed by similar administration of sodium nitroprusside (SNP). Hypovolemia was induced by a 600-ml bleed (25% estimated total blood volume). Only phenylephrine was readministered (same protocol). Hypovolemia was reversed by infusing 600 ml hydroxyethyl starch, before readministering phenylephrine and SNP. The relationships between mean arterial pressure (MAP) and cerebral, thoracic, and lumbar spinal cord tissue oxygenation indices (TOIs) were evaluated. RESULTS: Thoracic and lumbar spinal cord TOIs were approximately 15% and 10% lower, respectively, than the cerebral TOI at similar MAPs. The average relationship between MAP and each TOI showed an autoregulatory pattern, but negative correlations were observed in the cerebral TOI during phenylephrine infusion. A 600-ml bleed lowered each relationship < 5% and subsequent fluid resuscitation did not change the relationship. Individual oxygenation responses to blood pressure indicated that the spinal cord is more pressure-passive than the cerebrum. Paradoxical responses (an inverse relationship of tissue oxygenation to MAP) were observed particularly in cerebrum during phenylephrine infusion and were rare in the spinal cord. CONCLUSIONS: Spinal cord autoregulation is less robust than cerebral autoregulation and more pressure-dependent. Similar to cerebral oxygenation, spinal cord oxygenation is volume-tolerant but is more sensitive to hypotension.","Kurita, Tadayoshi; Kawashima, Shingo; Morita, Koji; Nakajima, Yoshiki",J Intensive Care,188,1

Samples were collected on four sampling campaigns over a one‐year cycle. Significant differences were found in the water column in dissolved oxygen, dissolved inorganic nitrogen, phosphate and total phosphorus concentrations between the fish farm and the control. The increase in the dissolved inorganic nitrogen and phosphate concentrations at the fish farm modified the stoichiometric ratios between nutrients, with silicate acting as limiting nutrient at the fish farm 11% more than at the control. Nevertheless, chlorophyll a concentration in the water column was higher at the control station, probably due to the fouling of the underwater fish farm structures. Significant differences were found in sediment concentrations of organic matter, total phosphorus and redox potential between the fish farm and the control. The Canonical Correlation Analysis indicated that organic matter, total phosphorus, redox potential and% of gravels accounted for 68.9% of the total variance in the species data. Changes were observed in macrofauna, with a decrease in number of species and up to a nine‐fold increase in abundance with respect to the control.","Morata, Tania; Falco, Silvia; Gadea, Isabel; Sospedra, Javier; Rodilla, Miguel",Aquac Res,188,1

This study aimed to generate ECM hydrogels from control, severe COPD [Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) IV], and fibrotic human lung tissue and evaluate whether their stiffness and viscoelastic properties were reflective of native tissue. For hydrogel generation, control, COPD GOLD IV, and fibrotic human lung tissues were decellularized, lyophilized, ground into powder, porcine pepsin solubilized, buffered with PBS, and gelled at 37°C. Rheological properties from tissues and hydrogels were assessed with a low-load compression tester measuring the stiffness and viscoelastic properties in terms of a generalized Maxwell model representing phases of viscoelastic relaxation. The ECM hydrogels had a greater stress relaxation than tissues. ECM hydrogels required three Maxwell elements with slightly faster relaxation times (τ) than that of native tissue, which required four elements. The relative importance (R(i)) of the first Maxwell element contributed the most in ECM hydrogels, whereas for tissue the contribution was spread over all four elements. IPF tissue had a longer-lasting fourth element with a higher R(i) than the other tissues, and IPF ECM hydrogels did require a fourth Maxwell element, in contrast to all other ECM hydrogels.

11060,11060,11060,Global Regulatory Landscape for Aggregate Safety Assessments: Recent Developments and Future Directions,14.409832,5.682781,2020-01-06,"ABSTRACT: Selenium is an essential immunonutrient which holds the human’s metabolic activity with its chemical bonds. The organic forms of selenium naturally present in human body are selenocysteine and selenoproteins. These forms have a unique way of synthesis and translational coding. Selenoproteins act as antioxidant warriors for thyroid regulation, male-fertility enhancement, and anti-inflammatory actions. They also participate indirectly in the mechanism of wound healing as oxidative stress reducers. Glutathione peroxidase (GPX) is the major selenoprotein present in the human body, which assists in the control of excessive production of free radical at the site of inflammation. Other than GPX, other selenoproteins include selenoprotein-S that regulates the inflammatory cytokines and selenoprotein-P that serves as an inducer of homeostasis. Previously, reports were mainly focused on the cellular and molecular mechanism of wound healing with reference to various animal models and cell lines. In this review, the role of selenium and its possible routes in translational decoding of selenocysteine, synthesis of selenoproteins, systemic action of selenoproteins and their indirect assimilation in the process of wound healing are explained in detail. Some of the selenium containing compounds which can acts as cancer preventive and therapeutics are also discussed. These compounds directly or indirectly exhibit antioxidant properties which can sustain the intracellular redox status and these activities protect the healthy cells from reactive oxygen species induced oxidative damage. Although the review covers the importance of selenium/selenoproteins in wound healing process, still some unresolved mystery persists which may be resolved in near future.

However, major knowledge gaps in Germany complicate appropriate approaches to best address these demands. This paper evaluates available information on the patient group and their healthcare needs from German data sources and derives implications for healthcare planning and regulation by national/federal self-governing bodies, political decision-makers, and specialized providers. METHODS: Based on the concept of needs, we addressed the normative dimension typically characterized by epidemiological data. Based on existing German health system data resources, an explorative approach was utilized to identify and characterize available databases providing information on the patient group and/or their healthcare. RESULTS: To date, no available database provides information on the healthcare needs of this patient group. As of the reporting year 2017, the diagnosis-related groups (DRG) statistics will provide hospital-specific data on home invasive ventilation interventions, but the data do not provide information on long-term care. Claims data may be a promising source for cross-sectoral evaluation of healthcare needs but feature methodological challenges. These results call for efforts to address limited data eligibility, adopt a broader understanding of healthcare needs, and identify actions needed to evidence informed and needs-oriented healthcare. CONCLUSION: Future approaches on needs-oriented specialized healthcare should close the existing knowledge gap based on reliable data. In addition to normative information, they should consider subjective dimensions on a life course perspective and quantitative and qualitative service performance characteristics across multiple sectors and professions.","Stark, Susanne; Ewers, Michael",Z Gesundh Wiss,188,1

One of the major causes of sepsis in burn patients is Pseudomonas aeruginosa. We hypothesized that during dissemination from infected burn wounds and subsequent sepsis, P. aeruginosa affects the metabolome of the blood resulting in changes to specific metabolites that would serve as biomarkers for early diagnosis of sepsis caused by P. aeruginosa. OBJECTIVES: To identify specific biomarkers in the blood after sepsis caused by P. aeruginosa infection of burns. METHODS: Gas chromatography with time-of-flight mass spectrometry was used to compare the serum metabolome of mice that were thermally injured and infected with P. aeruginosa (B–I) to that of mice that were neither injured nor infected, mice that were injured but not infected, and mice that were infected but not injured. RESULTS: Serum levels of 19 metabolites were significantly increased in the B–I group compared to controls while levels of eight metabolites were significantly decreased. Thymidine, thymine, uridine, and uracil (related to pyrimidine metabolism), malate and succinate (a possible sign of imbalance in the tricarboxylic acid cycle), 5-oxoproline (related to glutamine and glutathione metabolism), and trans-4-hydroxyproline (a major component of the protein collagen) were increased. Products of amino acid metabolism were significantly decreased in the B–I group, including methionine, tyrosine, indole-3-acetate, and indole-3-propionate. CONCLUSION: In all, 26 metabolites were identified, including a unique combination of five metabolites (trans-4-hydroxyproline, 5-oxoproline, glycerol-3-galactoside, indole-3-acetate, and indole-3-propionate) that could serve as a set of biomarkers for early diagnosis of sepsis caused by P. aeruginosa in burn patients.

However, the incidence of VAP among patients with TBI reported in studies varies widely. What is more, the risk factors and outcomes of VAP are controversial. This study estimates the incidence, risk factors, and outcomes of VAP in patients with TBI and provides evidence for prevention and treatment. PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, and Web of Science databases were searched from the earliest records to May 2018. Data involving the incidence, risk factors, and outcomes were extracted for meta-analysis. The results showed that the incidence of VAP was 36% (95% confidence interval (CI) 31–41%); risk factors analyses showed that smoking [odds ratio (OR) 2.13; 95% CI 1.16–3.92], tracheostomy (OR 9.55; 95% CI 3.24–28.17), blood transfusion on admission (OR 2.54; 95% CI 1.24–5.18), barbiturate infusion (OR 3.52; 95% CI 1.68–7.40), injury severity score (OR 4.65; 95% CI 1.96–7.34), and head abbreviated injury scale (OR 2.99; 95% CI 1.66–5.37) were related to the occurrence of VAP. When patients developed VAP, mechanical ventilation time (OR 5.45; 95% CI 3.78–7.12), ICU length of stay (OR 6.85; 95% CI 4.90–8.79), and hospital length of stay (OR 10.92; 95% CI 9.12–12.72) were significantly increased. However, VAP was not associated with an increased risk of mortality (OR 1.28; 95% CI 0.74–2.21). VAP is common in patients with TBI. It is affected by a series of factors and has a poor prognosis.

So far, most approaches used to assess GABA activity involve invasive low -throughput electrophysiological techniques or rely on fluorescent dyes, preventing the ability to conduct noninvasive and thus nonperturbing screens. To address this limitation, we have developed an automated marker-free cell imaging method, based on digital holographic microscopy (DHM). This technology allows the automatically screening of compounds in multiple plates without having to label the cells or use special plates. This methodological approach was first validated by screening the GABA(A) receptor expressed in HEK cells using a selection of active compounds in agonist, antagonist, and modulator modes. Then, in a second blind screen of a library of 3041 compounds (mostly composed of natural products), 5 compounds having a specific agonist action on the GABA(A) receptor were identified. The hits validated from this unbiased screen were the natural products muscimol, neurosteroid alphaxalone, and three compounds belonging to the avermectin family, all known for having an agonistic effect on the GABA(A) receptor. The results obtained were exempt from false negatives (structurally similar unassigned hits), and false-positive hits were detected and discarded without the need for performing electrophysiological measurements. The outcome of the screen demonstrates the applicability of our screening by imaging method for the discovery of new chemical structures, particularly regarding chemicals interacting with the ionotropic GABA(A) receptor and more generally with any ligand-gated ion channels and transporters.","Rappaz, Benjamin; Jourdain, Pascal; Banfi, Damiano; Kuttler, Fabien; Marquet, Pierre; Turcatti, Gerardo",SLAS Discov,188,22

Through an ARUK Scottish Network supported questionnaire and workshop (mostly UK-based researchers), we aimed to determine underlying variability and what could be implemented to overcome identified challenges. Twelve UK VCI research centres were identified and invited to complete a questionnaire and attend a one-day workshop. Questionnaire responses demonstrated agreement that outcome assessments in VCI preclinical research vary by group and even those common across groups, may be performed differently. From the workshop, six themes were discussed: issues with preclinical models, reasons for choosing functional assessments, issues in interpretation of functional assessments, describing and reporting functional outcome assessments, sharing resources and expertise, and standardization of outcomes. Eight consensus points emerged demonstrating broadly that the chosen assessment should reflect the deficit being measured, and therefore that one assessment does not suit all models; guidance/standardisation on recording VCI outcome reporting is needed and that uniformity would be aided by a platform to share expertise, material, protocols and procedures thus reducing heterogeneity and so increasing potential for collaboration, comparison and replication. As a result of the workshop, UK wide consensus statements were agreed and future priorities for preclinical research identified.","McFall, Aisling; Hietamies, Tuuli M; Bernard, Ashton; Aimable, Margaux; Allan, Stuart M; Bath, Philip M; Brezzo, Gaia; Carare, Roxana O; Carswell, Hilary V; Clarkson, Andrew N; Currie, Gillian; Farr, Tracy D; Fowler, Jill H; Good, Mark; Hainsworth, Atticus H; Hall, Catherine; Horsburgh, Karen; Kalaria, Rajesh; Kehoe, Patrick; Lawrence, Catherine; Macleod, Malcolm; McColl, Barry W; McNeilly, Alison; Miller, Alyson A; Miners, Scott; Mok, Vincent; O’Sullivan, Michael; Platt, Bettina; Sena, Emily S; Sharp, Matthew; Strangward, Patrick; Szymkowiak, Stefan; Touyz, Rhian M; Trueman, Rebecca C; White, Claire; McCabe, Chris; Work, Lorraine M; Quinn, Terence J",J Cereb Blood Flow Metab,188,1

This study aims to determine the filtration efficiency and airflow resistance of common household materials available for homemade mask production by comparing numbers of fabrics, various layers, and manipulation. METHODS: Common household woven, knitted, and nonwoven fabrics were tested for filtration efficiency using a fit testing setup and airflow resistance with pressure gauge setup. Three different levels of layering (1, 2, and 4) were tested. Some fabric material was further tested after washing and drying. Filtration performance, the area under the fitted curve comparing airflow resistance and filtration efficiency, was calculated for each fabric material and compared. RESULTS: Layering increased filtration efficiency and airflow resistance (P < 0.0001 and P < 0.01, respectively). Polyester felt demonstrated the highest filtration performance index (P < 0.0001), higher than all tested 100% cotton materials (all P < 0.05) as well as surgical masks (P < 0.05). Washing plus drying did not alter filtration performance significantly (P > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: A filtration performance of common household fabrics were compared.

Ganoderic acid (GA) is a group of lanostane triterpenes isolated from Ganoderma lucidum, which has shown a variety of pharmacological activities. In this study we investigated whether GA exerted antirenal fibrosis effect in a unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO) mouse model. After UUO surgery, the mice were treated with GA (3.125, 12.5, and 50 mg· kg(−1) ·d(−)(1), ip) for 7 or 14 days. Then the mice were sacrificed for collecting blood and kidneys. We showed that GA treatment dose-dependently attenuated UUO-induced tubular injury and renal fibrosis; GA (50 mg· kg(−1) ·d(−)(1)) significantly ameliorated renal disfunction during fibrosis progression. We further revealed that GA treatment inhibited the extracellular matrix (ECM) deposition in the kidney by suppressing the expression of fibronectin, mainly through hindering the over activation of TGF-β/Smad signaling. On the other hand, GA treatment significantly decreased the expression of mesenchymal cell markers alpha-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) and vimentin, and upregulated E-cadherin expression in the kidney, suggesting the suppression of tubular epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) partially via inhibiting both TGF-β/Smad and MAPK (ERK, JNK, p38) signaling pathways. The inhibitory effects of GA on TGF-β/Smad and MAPK signaling pathways were confirmed in TGF-β1-stimulated HK-2 cell model. GA-A, a GA monomer, was identified as a potent inhibitor on renal fibrosis in vitro. These data demonstrate that GA or GA-A might be developed as a potential therapeutic agent in the treatment of renal fibrosis.","Geng, Xiao-qiang; Ma, Ang; He, Jin-zhao; Wang, Liang; Jia, Ying-li; Shao, Guang-ying; Li, Min; Zhou, Hong; Lin, Shu-qian; Ran, Jian-hua; Yang, Bao-xue",Acta Pharmacol Sin,188,1

Counselees rated the importance of 45 items assessing their needs and preferences regarding the content and process of genetic counseling. Participants rated the items regarding discussion of information about their familial CRC risk (100 %) and preventive options (98 %) as important or very important. Fewer participants rated items concerning general information on genetics as important. Sensitive communication during counseling was considered very important by a large percentage of counselees. Generally, no major differences were seen between participants in relation to individual characteristics. Our data suggest that focusing on familial CRC risk and surveillance options, in combination with sensitive communication may lead to better satisfaction with genetic counseling.","Salemink, Simone; Dekker, Nicky; Kets, Carolien M.; van der Looij, Erica; van Zelst-Stams, Wendy A.

They represent a snapshot of opinions and usage at that time, providing a baseline for comparison as the technology continues to evolve and as usage increases. The survey assessed personal perspectives, opinions on clinical implementation and clinical utilization of ECS. The sample included 337 GCs of varying clinical fields, of whom 150 reported practicing in reproductive settings. Our findings demonstrate that, at the time, GCs indicated general agreement with ECS as a concept – for example, most GCs agreed that carrier screening should address diseases outside of current guidelines and also indicated personal interest in electing ECS. There were also disagreements or concerns expressed regarding appropriate pre- and post-test counseling (e.g., the content and delivery mode of adequate informed consent) and practical implementation (e.g., the amount of time available for follow-up care). This was the first quantitative study of a large number of GCs and it revealed initial overall support for ECS among the GC profession.

How to accurately describe the effectiveness of existing medical and health resources in combination with regional heterogeneity is of great significance to China’s medical and health reform. METHODS: Based on provincial panel data for the period of 2005 to 2017, combining expected output and unexpected output, this paper constructs a super-efficiency three-stage SBM-DEA model, to measure and analyze the spatial-temporal heterogeneity characteristics and influencing factors of public medical and health efficiency (PMHE). RESULTS: (1) After the impacts of random error and external environmental factors are removed, the mean value of overall PMHE is 0.9274, failing to reach DEA efficiency, and PMHE shows a fluctuated downward trend. (2) The adjusted PMHE level shows a prominent spatial imbalance at the stage 3. The average efficiency level is ranked by the East > the West > the Central > the Northeast. (3) The increases of GDP per capita and population density are beneficial to the improvement of PMHE, while income level and education level are disadvantageous to PMHE, and last, the urbanization level, an uncertain effect. (4) There is no σ convergence of the PMHE in the East, the Central and the West, that is, the internal differences may gradually expand in the future, while the Northeast shows a significant σ convergence trending of PMHE. (5) The state’s allocation of medical and health resources has undergone major changes during “The Twelfth Five-Year Plan”. CONCLUSION: This study innovatively incorporates undesired outputs of health care into the efficiency evaluation framework by constructing the main efficiency evaluation indicators. The results of the robust evaluation conclude that China’s existing investment in medical and health resources is generally not effective. Therefore, although China’s health care reform has made certain achievement, it is still necessary to expand the investment in health care resources.","Yi, Ming; Peng, Jiachao; Zhang, Lian; Zhang, Yao",Int J Equity Health,188,1

Recent studies and omics approaches suggest that phenotypic traits of longevity could converge in the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signalling pathway. The present study focuses on the comparative approach in heart tissue from 8 mammalian species with a ML ranging from 3.5 to 46 years. Gene expression, protein content, and concentration of regulatory metabolites of the mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) were measured using droplet digital PCR, western blot, and mass spectrometry, respectively. Our results demonstrate (1) the existence of differences in species-specific gene expression and protein content of mTORC1, (2) that the achievement of a high longevity phenotype correlates with decreased and inhibited mTORC1, (3) a decreased content of mTORC1 activators in long-lived animals, and (4) that these differences are independent of phylogeny.

A key limitation in our understanding of the cause and consequences of vaping is the lack of animal models of nicotine vapor self-administration. Here, we developed a novel model of voluntary electronic cigarette use in rats using operant behavior. We found that rats voluntarily exposed themselves to nicotine vapor to the point of reaching blood nicotine levels that are similar to humans. The level of responding on the active (nicotine) lever was similar to the inactive (air) lever and lower than the active lever that was associated with vehicle (polypropylene glycol/glycerol) vapor, suggesting low positive reinforcing effects and low nicotine vapor discrimination. Lever pressing behavior with nicotine vapor was pharmacologically prevented by the α4β2 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor partial agonist and α7 receptor full agonist varenicline in rats that self-administered nicotine but not vehicle vapor. Moreover, 3 weeks of daily (1 h) nicotine vapor self-administration produced addiction-like behaviors, including somatic signs of withdrawal, allodynia, anxiety-like behavior, and relapse-like behavior after 3 weeks of abstinence. Finally, 3 weeks of daily (1 h) nicotine vapor self-administration produced cardiopulmonary abnormalities and changes in α4, α3, and β2 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor subunit mRNA levels in the nucleus accumbens and medial prefrontal cortex.

A random selected line was employed as a control (CTL) comparison group for both CHF and CLF lines of animals. The present study performed Fos immunochemistry to investigate changes in neural activity in different brain structures among CHF and CLF rats when they were exposed to contextual cues that were previously associated with footshock. RESULTS: The study indicated that CHF rats expressed high Fos expression in the locus coeruleus, periventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVN), and lateral portion of the septal area and low Fos expression in the medial portion of the septal area, dentate gyrus, and prelimbic cortex (PL) compared to CTL animals. CLF rats exhibited a decrease in Fos expression in the PVN, PL, and basolateral nucleus of the amygdala and increase in the cingulate and perirhinal cortices compared to CTL animals.

State and local legislation to ban the sale of single-use cigarettes may be considered to prevent this waste, but scientific evidence on the impact of switching smokers to unfiltered cigarettes on smoking behavior and toxicant exposures is needed to inform this policy. We have designed an open-label, randomized, 9-week, crossover clinical trial of adult filtered-cigarette smokers who switch to unfiltered cigarettes. OBJECTIVE: Our objective is to understand the impact of switching smokers of filtered cigarettes to unfiltered cigarettes on smoking behavior and toxic exposures. METHODS: This trial involves a 1-week baseline period; a 2-week period of smoking filtered or unfiltered cigarettes, where groups are randomly assigned; a 3-week washout period; another 1-week baseline period; and a 2-week crossover period of smoking the opposite condition (ie, filtered or unfiltered cigarettes) for a sufficient sample size of 40 participants. We will determine changes in (1) observed topography (ie, puff count, interpuff interval, and puff volume) and cigarettes smoked per day, via butt counts and self-report, (2) expired carbon monoxide and excretion of urinary cotinine, 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanol, and volatile organic compounds, and (3) participants’ knowledge and attitudes toward unfiltered cigarettes, satisfaction with smoking, and intention to quit if they were not able to smoke filtered cigarettes. RESULTS: This study was funded in June 2018 and approved by the relevant Institutional Review Boards in July 2018. This study has enrolled 37 participants as of October 2020. Data analysis is currently underway, and trial results are expected to be published in spring 2021. CONCLUSIONS: This pilot proof-of-principle study will inform the design of a larger, future research project that can provide robust scientific evidence on our research question. Such a large study could inform possible state or local legislation to ban the sale of single-use filtered cigarettes in order to mitigate the environmental impact of discarded single-use plastic filters.

METHODS: The clinical data of 125 children with RMPP hospitalized in Tianjin Children’s Hospital from September 2018 to October 2019 were retrospectively analyzed. They were divided into two groups according to the dose of hormone. Compare the clinical features, laboratory findings, and imaging between the two groups, and use meaningful related indicators as ROC curves to find reference indicators for pulse therapy. RESULTS: (1) The median age of the group II was older than that of the group I(P < 0.05). (2) We found more severe presentations, higher incidence of extra-pulmonary complications and more serious radiological findings in group II, which needed oxygen more often, higher the hormone, higher usage rate of gamma globulin, higher usage rate of bronchoscopy, and higher incidence of plastic bronchitis(P < 0.05). (3) WBC, CRP, LDH, FER, D-D dimer, APTT, TT, PCT, IL-6 and the percentage of neutrophils in peripheral blood in Group II were higher than those in Group I(P < 0.05). (4) In ROC curve analysis, CRP, LDH, FER, and neutrophils of leukocyte classification were independent related factors that could be used as valuable predictors of methylprednisolone pulse therapy for RMPP in children.

However, there are few published core subspecialty curricula targeted to residents’ learning and practical needs, and little guidance regarding delivery of core subspecialty content to residents rotating across multiple clinical sites. Evaluate a novel oncology video curriculum for IM residents as a model for asynchronous subspecialty resident learning. Using the cognitive theory of multimedia learning, we developed a five-part oncology video curriculum targeted specifically to the needs of IM residents. All second- and third-year residents rotating in oncology clinics from October 2018 to March 2019 at a single training program were invited to participate. We evaluated curricular demand, efficacy, and acceptability, using completion rates, knowledge tests, and a survey. Twenty-eight of 31 (90.3%) residents utilized the curriculum. Resident knowledge improved after utilizing the modules, by 36.9% from pre- to posttests (95% CI [31.3-42.5]; P<0.001) and 13.7% from pre- to delayed posttests (95% CI [7.5-20.0]; P<0.001). Twenty-four of 31 (77.4%) answered the survey. Most residents agreed or strongly agreed that the curriculum contributed to their knowledge (95.2%) and added educational value beyond the clinical rotation (93.1%). Our curriculum evaluation supports the asynchronous delivery of oncology education targeted to the learning needs of IM residents using a novel core video curriculum.

Social networking sites (SNSs) have become sources of human–environment interactions and shaped the societal perception of climate change and its effect on society. This study, based on the extended parallel process model, aims to examine the effect of exposure to climate change-related information on SNSs on the pro-environmental behaviors of individuals. The study examines the mediation effect of fear of victimization from climate change between the exposure to climate change-related information on SNSs and pro-environmental behaviors, including the moderation effect of attention deficit and decision-making self-efficacy with the help of appropriate instruments. A total sample of 406 reliable questionnaires were collected from students using SNSs in China, and data were analyzed through SPSS and AMOS. Results indicate that the exposure to climate change-related information on SNSs has a direct positive effect on users’ pro-environmental behaviors (β = 0.299, p < 0.01). Fear of victimization from climate change also mediates the relationship between exposure to climate change-related information on SNSs and pro-environmental behaviors (β = 0.149, SE = 0.029, p < 0.01). In addition, attention deficit moderates the relationship of exposure to climate change-related information on SNSs with fear of victimization from climate change (β = −0.090, p ≤ 0.01) and pro-environmental behaviors (β = −0.090, p ≤ 0.05). Similarly, the relationship between fear of victimization from climate change and pro-environmental behaviors is moderated by decision-making self-efficacy (β = 0.267, p ≤ 0.01). The findings offer implications for media organizations and government policy makers, who should post or spread environmental information through the most trustworthy media, with trustworthy sources, in an effective manner, and without exaggerated adverse impacts.","Shah, Zakir; Wei, Lu; Ghani, Usman",Int J Environ Res Public Health,188,1

Despite the advantages, there are limitations imposed by location and time constraints. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to develop a smart speaker–based MMT program and evaluate the efficacy of the program in older adults without cognitive impairment. METHODS: This study used a case-control cohort design. The smart speaker–based MMT program comprised 3 training sessions per day, 5 days a week, for 8 weeks. Each training session took approximately 15 minutes. This program was implemented using smart speakers, not human trainers. All participants completed the Mini-Mental State Examination, Subjective Memory Complaints Questionnaire, Verbal Learning Test, Digit Span Test, fluency tests, and a short-form version of the Geriatric Depression Scale before and after training. RESULTS: A total of 60 subjects (29 in the MMT group and 31 in the control group) participated in the study.

Therefore, it is important to know the characteristics of the pediatric thoracic trauma to improve treatment results. In addition, this study examined the changes in pediatric thoracic trauma features and results from the establishment of a level 1 regional trauma center. METHODS: Data of 168 patients’ ≤ 15 years old diagnosed with thoracic trauma between 2008 and 2019 were retrospectively analyzed. RESULTS: Pedestrian traffic accidents were the most common cause of chest injury. The average injury severity score was 17.1 ± 12.4 and the average pediatric trauma score was 5.6 ± 4.1. Lung contusion was the most common in 134 cases. There were 48 cases of closed thoracostomy. There was one thoracotomy for cardiac laceration, one case for extracorporeal membranous oxygenation, and six cases for embolization. Of all, 25 patients died, providing a mortality rate of 14.9%. In addition, independent risk factors of in-hospital mortality were hemopneumothorax and cardiac contusion. Since 2014, when the level 1 regional trauma center was established, more severely injured thoracic trauma patients came. However, the mortality was similar in the two periods. CONCLUSIONS: Understanding the clinical features of pediatric thoracic trauma patients can help in efficient treatment. In addition, as the severity of pediatric thoracic trauma patients has increased due to the establishment of the regional trauma center, so pediatric trauma center should be organized in regional trauma center to improve the outcomes of pediatric thoracic trauma.

Steroid 5-alpha reductases (SRD5As) increase DHT production in the scalp hair follicles, resulting in hair thinning and hair loss. Even though synthetic SRD5A inhibitors (finasteride and dutasteride) are effective in treating AGA, they cause adverse effects. This has led to an increased interest in alternative treatments from natural sources. The value of Thai rice bran has increased because several of its components may have use in AGA treatment. This study aimed to compare the suppression of the expression of SRD5A genes (type 1–3) exerted by several Thai rice bran extracts and investigate the interactional mechanism of their components towards SRD5A type 2. Tubtim Chumphae rice bran (TRB) had the highest sum of overall bioactive compounds. Among all extracts, the expression of SRD5A genes was suppressed by TRB as well as finasteride. In silico simulation showed that α-tocopherol had the greatest interaction with SRD5A type 2. Our findings identified α-tocopherol as the key bioactive in TRB; it could be developed as an anti-hair loss product. ABSTRACT: Steroid 5-alpha reductases (SRD5As) are responsible for the conversion of testosterone to dihydrotestosterone, a potent androgen, which is the aetiologic factor of androgenetic alopecia. This study aimed to compare the SRD5A gene expression suppression activity exerted by Thai rice bran extracts and their components and investigate the interactional mechanism between bioactive compounds and SRD5A2 using molecular dynamics (MD) simulation. Bran of Oryza sativa cv. Tubtim Chumphae (TRB), Yamuechaebia Morchor (YRB), Riceberry (RRB), and Malinil Surin (MRB), all rice milling by-products, was solvent-extracted. The ethanolic extract of TRB had the highest sum of overall bioactive compounds (γ-oryzanol; α-, β-, and γ-tocopherol; phenolics; and flavonoids). Among all extracts, TRB greatly downregulated the expression of SRD5A1, SRD5A2, and SRD5A3; there were no significant differences between TRB and finasteride regarding SRD5A suppression. The linear relationship and principal component analysis supported that the α-tocopherol content was correlated with the SRD5A suppression exerted by TRB. Furthermore, MD simulation demonstrated that α-tocopherol had the highest binding affinity towards SRD5A2 by interacting with residues Phe118 and Trp201. Our findings indicate that α-tocopherol effectively downregulates the expression of SRD5A genes and inhibits SRD5A2 activity, actions that are comparable to standard finasteride. TRB, a source of α-tocopherol, could be developed as an anti-hair loss product.","Khantham, Chiranan; Yooin, Wipawadee; Sringarm, Korawan; Sommano, Sarana Rose; Jiranusornkul, Supat; Carmona, Francisco David; Nimlamool, Wutigri; Jantrawut, Pensak; Rachtanapun, Pornchai; Ruksiriwanich, Warintorn",Biology (Basel),188,1

In rodent, the bulk of its expression occurs in the central nervous system. Despite this, ApoD has profound effects in peripheral tissues, indicating that neural ApoD may reach peripheral organs. We endeavor to determine if cerebral ApoD can reach the circulation and accumulate in peripheral tissues. Three hours was necessary for over 40% of all the radiolabeled human ApoD (hApoD), injected bilaterally, to exit the central nervous system (CNS). Once in circulation, hApoD accumulates mostly in the kidneys/urine, liver, and muscles. Accumulation specificity of hApoD in these tissues was strongly correlated with the expression of lowly glycosylated basigin (BSG, CD147). hApoD was observed to pass through bEnd.3 blood brain barrier endothelial cells monolayers. However, cyclophilin A did not impact hApoD internalization rates in bEnd.3, indicating that ApoD exit from the brain is either independent of BSG or relies on additional cell types. Overall, our data showed that ApoD can quickly and efficiently exit the CNS and reach the liver and kidneys/urine, organs linked to the recycling and excretion of lipids and toxins. This indicated that cerebral overexpression during neurodegenerative episodes may serve to evacuate neurotoxic ApoD ligands from the CNS.","Desmarais, Frederik; Hervé, Vincent; Bergeron, Karl F.; Ravaut, Gaétan; Perrotte, Morgane; Fyfe-Desmarais, Guillaume; Rassart, Eric; Ramassamy, Charles; Mounier, Catherine",Int J Mol Sci,188,1

Published quantitative and qualitative studies and grey literature were systematically reviewed alongside an identification and description of abortion hotlines in the public domain. Our findings highlight that the existence of abortion hotlines is highly context-dependent. They may exist either as an independent community-based model of care, or as part of formal care pathways within the health system. Hotlines operating in contexts with legal restrictions seem to be broader in scope and will use innovative approaches to adapt to their setting and reach hard-to-reach populations. All the abortion hotlines that provided information on a data extraction form used evidence-based guidelines but women seeking medical abortion still struggle to access quality medications. There is limited data in general on abortion hotlines, especially on the user and provider experience.

With this, applicants are applying to and interviewing at more programs which has inherent cost and time implications. The purpose of this study was to assess these implications as well as investigate applicant attitudes toward proposed changes. METHODS: This is a cross-sectional survey study of 2019 and 2020 ARF applicants (n = 278) to a single institution. A 10-question survey was distributed to applicants regarding the application and interview process. This survey focused on application and interview volumes, financial and temporal commitments, as well as perceptions regarding potential application process changes. Descriptive statistics and chi-squared analysis were then performed. RESULTS: Of the 110 (40%) respondents, 87% spent >$3000 and 43% spent >$5000 during the application process. Most respondents applied to ≥26 programs (84%) and both received and attended ≥11 interviews (87% and 74.5%, respectively).

The calcineurin/NFAT (nuclear factor of activated T cells) pathway and the MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase)/Erk (extracellular signal-regulated kinase) pathway contribute to the pathogenesis of cardiac hypertrophy as an interdependent network of signaling cascades. How these pathways interact remains unclear and few direct targets responsible for the prohypertrophic role of NFAT have been described. METHODS: By engineering cardiomyocyte-specific ETS2 (a member of the E26 transformation-specific sequence [ETS] domain family) knockout mice, we investigated the role of ETS2 in cardiac hypertrophy. Primary cardiomyocytes were used to evaluate ETS2 function in cell growth. RESULTS: ETS2 is phosphorylated and activated by Erk1/2 on hypertrophic stimulation in both mouse (n=3) and human heart samples (n=8 to 19). Conditional deletion of ETS2 in mouse cardiomyocytes protects against pressure overload–induced cardiac hypertrophy (n=6 to 11). Silencing of ETS2 in the hearts of calcineurin transgenic mice significantly attenuates hypertrophic growth and contractile dysfunction (n=8). As a transcription factor, ETS2 is capable of binding to the promoters of hypertrophic marker genes, such as ANP, BNP, and Rcan1.4 (n=4). We report that ETS2 forms a complex with NFAT to stimulate transcriptional activity through increased NFAT binding to the promoters of at least 2 hypertrophy-stimulated genes: Rcan1.4 and microRNA-223 (=n4 to 6). Suppression of microRNA-223 in cardiomyocytes inhibits calcineurin-mediated cardiac hypertrophy (n=6), revealing microRNA-223 as a novel prohypertrophic target of the calcineurin/NFAT and Erk1/2-ETS2 pathways. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings point to a critical role for ETS2 in calcineurin/NFAT pathway-driven cardiac hypertrophy and unveil a previously unknown molecular connection between the Erk1/2 activation of ETS2 and expression of NFAT/ETS2 target genes.","Luo, Yuxuan; Jiang, Nan; May, Herman I.; Luo, Xiang; Ferdous, Anwarul; Schiattarella, Gabriele G.; Chen, Guihao; Li, Qinfeng; Li, Chao; Rothermel, Beverly A.; Jiang, Dingsheng; Lavandero, Sergio; Gillette, Thomas G.; Hill, Joseph A.",Circulation,188,5

Furthermore, passive administration of bnAbs in HIV-1 infected individuals has resulted in prolonged suppression of viral rebound following interruption of combination antiretroviral therapy, and robust antiviral activity when administered to viremic individuals. Recent results from the first efficacy trials testing repeated intravenous administrations of the anti-CD4 binding site bnAb VRC01 have demonstrated positive proof of concept that bnAb passive immunization can confer protection against HIV-1 infection in humans, but have also highlighted the considerable barriers that remain for such strategies to effectively contribute to control of the epidemic. In this review, we discuss the current status of clinical studies evaluating bnAbs for HIV-1 prevention, highlight lessons learned from the recent Antibody Mediated Prevention (AMP) efficacy trials, and provide an overview of strategies being employed to improve the breadth, potency, and durability of antiviral protection.","Walsh, Stephen R.; Seaman, Michael S.",Front Immunol,188,1

It is also designed to guide appropriate and timely tailor-made geriatric interventions. This study aimed to examine whether ER(2) assessment part was: 1) usable by ED healthcare workers (e.g. nurses) and 2) scoring system associated with long LOS in ED and in hospital, as well as hospital admission in older ED users on stretchers. METHODS: Based on an observational, prospective and longitudinal cohort study 1,800 participants visiting the ED of the Jewish General Hospital (Montreal, Quebec, Canada) were recruited between September and December 2017. ER(2) assessment determined three risk-levels (i.e., low, medium and high) for short-term ED undesirable outcomes. The rate of ER(2) digital form completed, the time to fill ER(2) items and obtain ER(2) risk-levels, the LOS in ED and in hospital, and hospital admission were used as outcomes. RESULTS: ER(2) was usable by ED nurses in charge of older ED users. High-risk group was associated with both increased ED stay (coefficient of regression β = 3.81 with P≤0.001) and hospital stay (coefficient of regression β = 4.60 with P = 0.002) as well as with hospital admission (HR = 1.32 with P≤0.001) when low ER(2) risk level was used as referent level. Kaplan-Meier distributions showed that the three risk groups of participants differed significantly (P = 0.001). Those with high-risk level (P≤0.001) were discharged later from hospital to a non-hospital location compared to those with low risk. There was no significant difference between those classified in low-risk and in medium-risk groups (P = 0.985) and those in medium and high-risk groups (P = 0.096). CONCLUSION: The ER(2) assessment part is usable in daily practice of ED care and its risk stratifications may be used to predict adverse outcomes including prolonged LOS in ED and in hospital as well as hospital admission.

METHODS: The effect of small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) on peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) in 34 patients with oncogene-driven NSCLC (cohort A) was compared with those from 35 NSCLC patients without oncogene-driven mutations received ICI (cohort B) or from 22 treatment-naïve NSCLC patients (cohort C). Data for each blood biomarker were summarized by mean and standard deviation and compared by Wilcoxon rank sum tests or Kruskal-Wallis tests with significance at 2-sided p value < 0.05. Co-culture of PBMCs and pleural effusion-derived tumor cells from individual patients with oncogene-driven NSCLC was used to determine the in vitro cytotoxicity of TKI and ICI. RESULTS: Except for low CD3% in cohort A, there were no significant differences in other 12 blood biomarkers among the 3 cohorts at baseline. TKI treatment in cohort A was associated with significant increase in CD3% and decrease in total and absolute neutrophils (p < 0.05). In cohort B, patients with good clinical response to ICI treatment (N = 18) had significant increases in absolute lymphocyte counts (ALCs), CD4 and/or CD8 cell counts. Conversely, those patients with poor clinical response to ICI (N = 17) had significant decreases in these cell counts. Of the 27 patients with pre- and post-treatment blood samples in cohort A, 11 had poor clinical response to TKIs and decreased lymphocyte counts. Of the remaining 16 patients who had good clinical response to TKI therapy, 10 (62.5%) patients had decreased, and 6 (37.5%) patients had increased lymphocyte counts. Multicolor immunophenotyping of PBMCs revealed ICI treatment activated additional immune cell types that need further validation. We confirmed that TKI treatment could either antagonize or enhance the effect of ICIs in the co-culture assay using patient’s tumor cells and PBMCs. CONCLUSIONS: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study showing that TKIs can have various effects on blood immune cells, which may affect their response to ICIs. Further validation of the blood biomarker and in vitro assay is warranted.","Ma, Weijie; Zeng, Jie; Chen, Shuai; Lyu, Yue; Toomey, Kyra A.; Phan, Chinh T.; Yoneda, Ken Y.; Li, Tianhong",Biomark Res,188,1

However, to what extent this applies to medical journals of different specialties remains unclear. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the gender distribution of the editors in chief at leading medical journals. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Cross-sectional study of the editors in chief at the top 10 international medical journals of 41 categories related to the medical specialties of the Clarivate Analytics Web of Science Journal Citation Reports in 2019. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Proportion of women as editors in chief. RESULTS: This study found that, overall, women represented 21% (94 of 44) of the editors in chief, with wide variation across medical specialties from 0% to 82%. There were 5 categories for which none of the editors in chief were women (dentistry, oral surgery and medicine; allergy; psychiatry; anesthesiology; and ophthalmology) and only 3 categories for which women outnumbered men as editors in chief (primary health care, microbiology, and genetics and heredity). In 27 of the 41 categories, women represented less than a third of the editors in chief (eg, 1 of 10 for critical care medicine, 2 of 10 for gastroenterology and hepatology, and 3 of 10 for endocrinology and metabolism). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This study found that women are underrepresented among editors in chief of leading medical journals. For the benefit of medical research, a joint effort from editorial boards, publishers, authors, and academic institutions is required to address this gender gap.","Pinho-Gomes, Ana-Catarina; Vassallo, Amy; Thompson, Kelly; Womersley, Kate; Norton, Robyn; Woodward, Mark",JAMA Netw Open,188,1

METHODS: Data from patients with sepsis were retrospectively collected from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC) database. Included patients were randomly divided into training and validation cohorts. Variables were selected using a backward stepwise selection method with Cox regression, then used to construct a prognostic nomogram. The nomogram was compared with the SOFA model using the concordance index (C-index), area under the time-dependent receiver operating characteristics curve (AUC), net reclassification improvement (NRI), integrated discrimination improvement (IDI), calibration plotting, and decision-curve analysis (DCA). RESULTS: A total of 5240 patients were included in the study. Patient’s age, SOFA score, metastatic cancer, SpO(2), lactate, body temperature, albumin, and red blood cell distribution width were included in the nomogram. The C-index, AUC, NRI, IDI, and DCA of the nomogram showed that it performs better than the SOFA alone.

However, loss of appropriate control mechanisms can result in constitutive pathogenic ISG upregulation. Here, we used genome‐scale loss‐of‐function screening to establish genes critical for IFN‐induced transcription, identifying all expected members of the JAK‐STAT signaling pathway and a previously unappreciated epigenetic reader, bromodomain‐containing protein 9 (BRD9), the defining subunit of non‐canonical BAF (ncBAF) chromatin‐remodeling complexes. Genetic knockout or small‐molecule‐mediated degradation of BRD9 limits IFN‐induced expression of a subset of ISGs in multiple cell types and prevents IFN from exerting full antiviral activity against several RNA and DNA viruses, including influenza virus, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV1), and herpes simplex virus (HSV1). Mechanistically, BRD9 acts at the level of transcription, and its IFN‐triggered proximal association with the ISG transcriptional activator, STAT2, suggests a functional localization at selected ISG promoters. Furthermore, BRD9 relies on its intact acetyl‐binding bromodomain and unique ncBAF scaffolding interaction with GLTSCR1/1L to promote IFN action. Given its druggability, BRD9 is an attractive target for dampening ISG expression under certain autoinflammatory conditions.","Börold, Jacob; Eletto, Davide; Busnadiego, Idoia; Mair, Nina K; Moritz, Eva; Schiefer, Samira; Schmidt, Nora; Petric, Philipp P; Wong, W Wei‐Lynn; Schwemmle, Martin; Hale, Benjamin G",EMBO Rep,188,1

The approval of targeted antibodies against the calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) and its receptor represents a powerful instrument. In this study, we observed how biological and clinical features of resistant migraineurs responded to erenumab, fremanezumab, or galcanezumab. We found a reduction in advanced oxidation protein products (AOPP) as a biomarker of improved redox state after six months of treatment. We also found that treatment efficacy was precocious and maintained with high individual responder rates. In particular, seven out of ten patients achieved a reduction of 50% from the baseline at three months, which was maintained at six months, while about one out of our patients experienced a 75% reduction in headache frequency from the first month of treatment. The migraine disability assessment (MIDAS) and the associated fatigue, anxiety, and sleep quality also significantly improved. The allodynia symptom dropped from moderate/severe to mild/absent as a sign of central sensitization reduction. Our study confirmed the safety and efficacy of CGRP inhibition in real-life, high-challenging patients.

This study aimed to evaluate a physiology-based mathematical method to transform peripheral venous blood acid–base values into mathematically arterialised equivalents following acute, transient changes in ventilation. Data from thirty patients scheduled for elective surgery were analysed using the physiology-based method. These data described ventilator changes simulating ‘hyper-’ or ‘hypoventilation’ at arterial puncture and included acid–base status from simultaneously drawn blood samples from arterial and peripheral venous catheters at baseline and following ventilatory change. Venous blood was used to calculate mathematically arterialised equivalents using the physiology-based method; baseline values were analysed using Bland–Altman plots. When compared to baseline, measured arterial and calculated arterialised values at each time point within limits of pH: ± 0.03 and PCO(2): ± 0.5 kPa, were considered ‘not different from baseline’. Percentage of values considered not different from baseline were calculated at each sampling timepoint following hyper- and hypoventilation. For the physiological method, bias and limits of agreement for pH and PCO(2) were -0.001 (-0.022 to 0.020) and -0.02 (-0.37 to 0.33) kPa at baseline, respectively. 60 s following a change in ventilation, 100% of the mathematically arterialised values of pH and PCO(2) were not different from baseline, compared to less than 40% of the measured arterial values at the same timepoint. In clinical situations where transient breath-holding or hyperventilation may compromise the accuracy of arterial blood samples, arterialised venous blood is a stable representative of steady state arterial blood.","Shastri, Lisha; Kjærgaard, Søren; Thyrrestrup, Peter Søndergaard; Rees, Stephen Edward; Thomsen, Lars Pilegaard",J Clin Monit Comput,188,1

Aims: To report the experience of a single centre in the application of Hood CPAP for provision of NIV. Methods: We retrospectively analysed all children admitted to a six bedded PCCU for NIV over a 2 year period. Children included in the study were those who had failed conventional mask CPAP yet gone on to tolerate Hood CPAP for >24 hours or until NIV was no longer required. Results: Six patients (4 males) were identified with mean age of 14 months (range 6 months - 3 years). The reasons for failing conventional CPAP were pressure areas on face (1), child intolerance of mask pressing on face (4) and inability to get seal due to facial abnormalities (1). The indications for CPAP included primary Respiratory condition (5) and neuromuscular (1). The underlying co-morbidities were ex pre-maturity (2), Trisomy 21 (2), congenital abnormalities (1) and none (1). Hypothermia was observed as a complication in 2 patients. Conclusions: Intolerance of the mask is a problem in the ‘toddler’ age range, and in our experience the HOOD is an under-utilised but useful interface to provide CPAP in these patient groups. It can be used successfully as an alternative to intubation, for relief of facial pressure areas and to provide an effective seal in case of facial abnormalities.","Ronan, C; Turton, C; Vaidya, M; Rajan, Thyaga S",Pediatr Res,188,1

Titled Bill C-50, the amendment shifts discretionary powers from Parliament to current and future immigration and citizenship ministers. Touted by the Conservative Party as an expedient remedy to the 900,000-applicant backlog and an estimated labour shortage of 300,000, Bill C- 50 raised immediate concerns within immigrant and activist communities (CBC News, 2008). Critics contend that the bill caters to the interests of Canadian employers and business lobbyists in its provision of “disposable” and inexpensive labour, while “family” and “refugee” applications may be deferred indefinitely and without recourse. In some ways, the changes under Bill C-50 are redolent of the Live-in Caregiver Program in Canada as well as the Bracero Program (1942-1964), Guest Worker legislation and H-2A initiatives in the US, all of which offered temporary visas to migrant workers but resembled what Gilbert Gonzalez calls “an imperialist schema of colonial labour” (2006, p. 2). Whereas government policies in North America continue to reduce migrants to economic figures, other conservative discourses depict migrants as self-identical foreigners who flood the economy with cheap labour, deplete welfare resources reserved for “native”citizens and present a possible threat of terror in the “post-9/11” era. If “the socalled invasion of immigrants is the exaggerated rhetoric” of political pundits, however, “the increase in global migration within and from Third World countries is real” (Bakan and Stasiulis, 1997b, p. 30).","Brayton, Sean",Precarious International Multicultural Education,188,1

A review of studies indicates that climate change is unlikely to have much impact on agriculture and forestry; projected climate change will increase productivity in some regions while reducing it in others, leading to a redistribution of land rents with little impact on overall output. When CO(2) fertilization is taken into account, there might even be an overall increase in primary sector productivity that results in more undisturbed land, thus protecting biodiversity. Other findings in this chapter also run counter to current shibboleths: The biggest threat to polar bears is hunting, not climate change; current trends in Arctic ice extent are not without historical precedent; sea level rise is not an imminent threat; extreme weather events are not increasing; malaria is not only a tropical disease; and human health is a function of income, not climate, with bottom-up models using UN data predicting that death rates from almost all causes will be lower with projected global warming than without it. Meanwhile, integrated assessment models (IAMs) simply assume damages are an arbitrary function of temperature; upon balancing discounted costs and benefits, IAMs can be used to find an optimal path (usually of a carbon tax or emissions cap) for mitigating climate change. It is shown that different assumptions regarding damages, the discount rate, and/or the probability of catastrophic damage can be used to justify completely different policies for addressing global warming. Therefore, a carbon tax that is contingent on the temperature in the troposphere above the tropics – where the earliest indication of global warming is predicted to occur – is considered to be the preferred policy strategy as it should appeal to global warming proponents and skeptics alike. Finally, the Kaya identity is used to demonstrate the policy dilemma that decision makers face in reducing CO(2) emissions.","van Kooten, G.

The ravages of the Spanish Flu pandemic were so terrible that at least one culture decided the most humane way of dealing with the aftermath was simply to ignore it—to pretend the disease had not happened. Could a new pandemic possibly be worse than the Black Death or the Spanish Flu?

Such concern is driven by the widespread availability of radiological materials and the intentions of malfeasants and organizations around the world to do harm to others. In contrast to nuclear materials, radiological materials are ubiquitous and are found in most cities throughout the country at academic institutions, hospitals, and many businesses and industrial settings. In contrast, nuclear materials are difficult to access because of their rarity and the security of the settings in which they are found. A radiological or nuclear incident of any kind will require prompt assessment of the location and nature of the incident, activation of mass casualty response systems, followed by immediate consultation of hematology, health and medical physics, and nuclear medicine personnel. Radiation-induced injuries and illnesses are typically delayed. Successful assessment and management of individuals with acute radiation syndrome (ARS), including the hematopoietic subsyndrome (HS), is required to support management of injuries resulting from a high radiation dose, including injuries to the gastrointestinal and neurovascular systems. Administration of cytokines within 24 h of exposure shortens the period of granulocytopenia and is strongly recommended by subject matter experts in the management of the HS. Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation after failure of a 2–3 week trial of cytokines has been clearly documented and is weakly recommended in selected individuals with the HS. Administration of prophylactic and therapeutic broad-spectrum antimicrobials (including antibacterial, antiviral, and antifungal agents) is recommended and should be guided by recommendations of the Infectious Diseases Society of America for management of febrile neutropenia. This article provides an overview for clinicians who are called upon in a radiological and/or nuclear incident to manage individuals with ARS and other radiation-related illnesses.","Dainiak, Nicholas; Goans, Ronald E.; Iddins, Carol J.; Case, Cullen",Oncologic Emergency Medicine,188,1

The recent work of Abdollahpouri et al. in the context of movie recommendations has shown that this popularity bias leads to unfair treatment of both long-tail items as well as users with little interest in popular items. In this paper, we reproduce the analyses of Abdollahpouri et al. in the context of music recommendation. Specifically, we investigate three user groups from the Last.fm music platform that are categorized based on how much their listening preferences deviate from the most popular music among all Last.fm users in the dataset: (i) low-mainstream users, (ii) medium-mainstream users, and (iii) high-mainstream users. In line with Abdollahpouri et al., we find that state-of-the-art recommendation algorithms favor popular items also in the music domain. However, their proposed Group Average Popularity metric yields different results for Last.fm than for the movie domain, presumably due to the larger number of available items (i.e., music artists) in the Last.fm dataset we use. Finally, we compare the accuracy results of the recommendation algorithms for the three user groups and find that the low-mainstreaminess group significantly receives the worst recommendations.","Kowald, Dominik; Schedl, Markus; Lex, Elisabeth",Advances in Information Retrieval,188,1

In a matter of months there were around 8,000 infections and over 689 deaths related to severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). In my hometown, Toronto, 43 people died of SARS during the outbreaks of 2003. Approach – This chapter examines issues of class and poverty in emergence of SARS. The chapter begins with a discussion of the political economy of the emergence of SARS, and its relation to the spread of the virus. It then discusses issues of public policy, and particularly neo-liberal cuts to social services and public spending, that set the stage for the SARS outbreak, influenced its impact and contributed to the failures of response in Ontario. Findings – Through analysis of the lack of social resources available to working people in the province and the prioritizing of corporate, particularly tourism industry, concerns, the chapter illustrates how issues of class underpinned public responses to SARS, exacerbating problems. The chapter concludes by giving attention to the need for social solidarity and community mutual aid. Contributions to the field – The chapter shows the extent to which neo-liberal governments prioritize business security above the health and social security of workers and reveals some of the ways in which the pressures of capitalist social relations make people ill.","Shantz, Jeffrey",,188,1

They combine discrete dynamics represented by state machines or finite automata with continuous behaviors represented by differential equations. The measurement of continuous behaviors is performed by sensors. When these sensors have a continuous access to these measurements, we call such model an Event-Triggered model. The properties of this model are easier to prove, while its implementation is difficult in practice. Therefore, it is preferable to introduce a more realistic model, called Time-Triggered model, where the sensors take periodic measurements. Contrary to Event-Triggered models, Time-Triggered models are much easier to implement, but much more difficult to verify. Based on the differential refinement logic (dR[Formula: see text]), a dynamic logic for refinement relations on hybrid systems, it is possible to prove that a Time-Triggered model refines an Event-Triggered model. The major limitation of such logic is that it is not supported by any prover. In this paper, we propose a correct-by-construction approach that implements the reasoning on hybrid programs particularly the reasoning of dR[Formula: see text] in Event-B to take advantage of its associated tools.","Afendi, Meryem; Laleau, Régine; Mammar, Amel",Rigorous State-Based Methods,188,1

It then delves into the drivers and modalities of Africa’s alleged shift to finally explore geopolitical dynamics, questioning whether Africa is still the locus for the global supply of natural resources, introducing patterns of engagement between Africa and international/regional actors, and finally presenting the socio-economic implications of the shift. We conclude that while the venues and sources of geopolitical interest might change in the new geopolitical order that the transition to renewable energy implies, the content and modalities of interaction may see a continuity with the past, namely, dependence on external financing and technology.

34479,34479,34479,Letter from Editor,14.350551,5.782766,2020-06-15,"BACKGROUND: Endotoxins can induce an excessive inflammatory response and result in microcirculatory dysfunction. Polymyxin-B hemoperfusion (PMX-HP) has been recognized to effectively remove endotoxins in patients with sepsis and septic shock, and a rat sepsis model revealed that PMX-HP treatment can maintain a better microcirculation. The primary aim of this study was to investigate the effect of PMX-HP on microcirculation in patients with septic shock. METHODS: Patients with septic shock were enrolled and randomized to control and PMX-HP groups. In the PMX-HP group, patients received the first session of PMX-HP in addition to conventional septic shock management within 24 h after the onset of septic shock; the second session of PMX-HP was provided after another 24 h as needed. RESULTS: Overall, 28 patients finished the trial and were analyzed. The mean arterial pressure and norepinephrine infusion dose did not differ significantly between the control and PMX-HP groups after PMX-HP treatment. At 48 h after enrollment, total vessel density (TVD) and perfused vessel density (PVD) were higher in the PMX-HP group than in the control group [TVD 24.2 (22.1–24.9) vs. 21.1 (19.9–22.9) mm/mm(2); p = 0.007; PVD 22.9 (20.9–24.9) vs. 20.0 (18.9–21.6) mm/mm(2), p = 0.008]. CONCLUSIONS: This preliminary study observed that PMX-HP treatment improved microcirculation but not clinical outcomes in patients with septic shock at a low risk of mortality. Nevertheless, larger multicenter trials are needed to confirm the effect of PMX-HP treatment on microcirculation in patients with septic shock at intermediate- and high-risk of mortality.

35570,35570,35570,Grundfos celebrates 75(th) anniversary,14.52902,5.8976555,2020-06-29,"OBJECTIVES: Sepsis is a leading cause of death in the United States. Putative targets to prevent systemic inflammatory response syndrome include antagonism of toll-like receptors 2 and 4 and CD44 receptors in vascular endothelial cells. Proteoglycan-4 is a mucinous glycoprotein that interacts with CD44 and toll-like receptor 4 resulting in a blockade of the NOD-like receptor pyrin domain-containing-3 pathway. We hypothesized that endothelial cells induced into a sepsis phenotype would have less interleukin-6 expression after recombinant human proteoglycan 4 treatment in vitro. DESIGN: Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and reverse transcriptase-quantitative polymerase chain reaction to measure interleukin-6 protein and gene expression. SETTING: Research laboratory. SUBJECTS: Human umbilical vascular endothelial cells, human lung microvascular endothelial cells, and transgenic mouse (wild type) (Cd44(+/+)/Prg4(+/+)), Cd44(–/–) (Cd44(tm1Hbg)Prg4(+/+)), Prg4(GT/GT) (Cd44(+/+) Prg4(tm2Mawa/J)), and double knockout (Cd44(tm1Hbg) Prg4(tm2Mawa/J)) lung microvascular endothelial cells. INTERVENTIONS: Cells were treated with 100 or 250 ng/mL lipopolysaccharide-Escherichia coli K12 and subsequently treated with recombinant human proteoglycan 4 after 30 minutes. Interleukin-6 levels in conditioned media were measured via enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and gene expression was measured via reverse transcriptase-quantitative polymerase chain reaction with ΔΔ–Ct analysis. Additionally, human umbilical vascular endothelial cells and human lung microvascular endothelial cells were treated with 1:10 diluted plasma from 15 patients with sepsis in culture media. After 30 minutes, either 50 or 100 µg/mL recombinant human proteoglycan 4 was administered. Interleukin-6 protein and gene expression were assayed. Proteoglycan 4 levels were also compared between control and sepsis patient plasma. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Human umbilical vascular endothelial cell, human lung microvascular endothelial cell, and mouse lung microvascular endothelial cell treated with lipopolysaccharide had significantly increased interleukin-6 protein compared with controls. Recombinant human proteoglycan-4 significantly reduced interleukin-6 in human and mouse endothelial cells. Interleukin-6 gene expression was significantly increased after lipopolysaccharide treatment compared with controls. This response was reversed by 50 or 100 µg/mL recombinant human proteoglycan-4 in 80% of sepsis samples in human umbilical vascular endothelial cells and in 60–73% in human lung microvascular endothelial cells. In Cd44(–/–) genotypes of the mouse lung microvascular endothelial cells, recombinant human proteoglycan-4 significantly reduced interleukin-6 protein levels after lipopolysaccharide treatment, indicating that Cd44 is not needed for recombinant human proteoglycan-4 to have an effect in a toll-like receptor 4 agonist inflammation model. Patient sepsis samples had higher plasma levels of native proteoglycan-4 than controls. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: Recombinant human proteoglycan-4 is a potential adjunct therapy for sepsis patients and warrants future in vivo model studies.","Richendrfer, Holly A.; Levy, Mitchell M.; Elsaid, Khaled A.; Schmidt, Tannin A.; Zhang, Ling; Cabezas, Ralph; Jay, Gregory D.",Crit Care Explor,188,1

Anchored in economic and network sociology, the approach has been enriched by contributions from management sciences and geomatics, which have made it possible to conceptualise a city’s supply system as a network that is both social and spatialised, structured by operators and circulating differentiated products. Tested in the city of Montpellier, a signatory of the Milan Pact, this research was based on the production of primary data from a variety of sellers and suppliers. While confirming the complementarity between short and long supply chains, the results show more broadly how the articulation of three spatialised markets favours the resilience of the city’s supply, even if it is also a source of vulnerability. Therefore, these results make an original contribution to the intersection of research on the resilience of urban supply and on coexistence in food systems, while also calling for further research.","Chiffoleau, Yuna; Brit, Anne-Cécile; Monnier, Milo; Akermann, Grégori; Lenormand, Maxime; Saucède, Florent",Rev Agric Food Environ Stud,188,1

While adults demonstrate strong preferences for natural environments over urban ones, it is not clear whether these affective benefits result from exposure to nature stimuli per se, or result from viewing a highly preferred stimulus. In one set of studies (Study 1 and 2), state affect before and after image viewing was examined as a function of both preference level (high, low, very high, or very low aesthetic value) and environment type (nature or urban). When aesthetic value was matched, no differences in affect change were found between environments. However, affect change was predicted by individual participants’ ratings for the images. The largest affective benefits occurred after viewing very high aesthetic nature images, but Study 2 lacked an equivalently preferred urban image set. In a second set of studies (Study 3 and 4), new sets of very highly preferred images in categories other than nature scenes (urban scenes and animals) were employed. As before, individual differences in preference for the images (but not image category) was predictive of changes in affect. In Study 5, the nature and urban images from Study 1were rated on beauty to assess whether the stimuli’s preference ratings were capturing anything other than simple aesthetics. Results showed that beauty/aesthetics and preference (‘liking’) were nearly identical. Lastly, a replication of Study 2 (Study 6) was conducted to test whether priming preference accounted for these benefits, but this was not the case. Together, these results suggest that nature improves affective state because it is such a highly preferred environment.","Meidenbauer, Kimberly L.; Stenfors, Cecilia U.D.; Bratman, Gregory N.; Gross, James J.; Schertz, Kathryn E.; Choe, Kyoung Whan; Berman, Marc G.",J Environ Psychol,188,1

STUDY DESIGN: Using data from the Guttmacher Institute's 2017 Abortion Provider Census, we examine amount charged for abortion care, pregnancy gestation at which abortions were offered, number of days per week that clinics provided abortions, and types of non-abortion services offered. Our analysis focuses on the 808 clinic facilities that provided 95% of abortions that year. Measures were calculated nationally and according to whether the clinic was in a state we categorized as hostile, middle-ground or supportive of abortion rights. RESULTS: In 2017, 64% of clinics offered abortion at 11 weeks pregnancy gestation, and 22% did so at 20 weeks gestation. Supportive states had a higher density of clinics that provide abortion for every measured gestation than hostile states. Clinics charged an average of $549 for a surgical abortion at 10 weeks and $551 for medication abortion. Some 46% of clinics in supportive states offered abortion care five or more days per week, compared to 29% in hostile states. Most clinics offered stand-alone contraception and family planning (87%) and gynecological care (85%), but the proportion of clinics that provided these services was higher in supportive states (93% and 90%) than in hostile states (75% and 73%). CONCLUSIONS: A substantial proportion of abortion facilities provide a range of other health care services. Aspects of service delivery, such as number of days abortions are provided, may vary according to abortion policy climate. Implications statement. Onerous policies in states hostile to abortion rights may inhibit some facilities from providing abortion more days per week, and if so, could further burden patients obtaining abortion care in these states.","Witwer, Elizabeth; Jones, Rachel K.; Fuentes, Liza; Castle, S.

Engineers build bridges based on foreknowledge of the forces that they are likely to encounter – and their constructions tend to withstand the test of time. Predicting the future course of epidemics and building intervention to contain them are much more precarious. And yet simulation models produced in prestigious centres for mathematical biology have played a significant role informing coronavirus policy in the United Kingdom and elsewhere. The predictive uncertainties include the inherent variability of the pathogen, considerable variation in host population immunity as well as the concern of this article, namely, the constantly adapting human judgements of those designing, implementing and experiencing the national response to an outbreak. Assumptions about how interventions are implemented and how people will react are, of course, built into modelling scenarios – but these estimates depict behavioural change in fixed, stimulus-response terms. Real reactions to the complex restrictions introduced to combat the virus unfold in scores of different pathways – people comply, they resist, they learn, they grow weary, they change their minds, they seek exceptions and so on. Model building is intrinsically speculative, and it is important that crisis management is not boxed in by its latent simplifications. A more pluralistic evidence base needs to be drawn on, to understand how complex interventions operate within complex societies.","Pawson, Ray",Evaluation (Lond),188,16

The first is that the partnership is based on a sober appreciation of the two sides’ respective national interests. For all the rhetoric about shared values and common worldviews, this is a pragmatic, interests-based relationship. Second, it is a partnership between strategically autonomous actors, each with its own distinct agenda. Beijing and Moscow agree on much. But they do not operate as a coordinated force in international politics, let alone seek to build a new authoritarian world order. Third, although the rise of China and resurgence of Russia are trends of fundamental importance, the impact of their partnership on global order has been peripheral. Finally, the long-term outlook for the Sino-Russian partnership is uncertain. Against the backdrop of a fluid international environment, Beijing and Moscow face significant challenges in sustaining the momentum of their cooperation.","Lo, Bobo",China Int Strategy Rev.,188,1

After adequate training, residents graduate with the capability to practice across different settings such as academic centers, community hospitals, and others. We present the effect of COVID 19 pandemic on the surgical case volume in a US training program. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed operative case volume at our program for the year 2019 and January-mid April 2020. We chose to include the mid-March to mid-April period as it corresponded to the time when our institution started deferring elective cases. We categorized cases as an elective cranial, elective spine, and emergency (trauma and other non-elective cases). We then summarized and compared the number of cases during this period. RESULTS: The average number of cases in 2019 was 99 cases per month (37 elective cranial, 42 elective spine, and 20 emergent). In 2020, The total case number in January, February, March, and mid-March to mid-April was 97, 86, 71, and 41cases respectively. In comparison to January 2020, February, March, mid-March to mid-April showed a 12%, 27%, and 58% reduction in the number of cases. The absolute number of emergent cases was comparable in January through mid-April 2020 (17,11,15, and 16) but in mid-March to mid-April emergent cases constituted 39% of the total case number. CONCLUSION: Neurosurgical residency is an eighty-four months of rigorous training with a minimum of 800 cases is required to prepare residents for a successful career in neurosurgery. The significant decline in the number of cases due to COVID 19 might affect the quality of training, especially for senior residents.","Aljuboori, Zaid; Ding, Dale; Williams, Brian",Neurosurgery,188,1

Initially, nonessential imaging studies, including screening mammography, were curtailed and even temporarily halted when lockdowns were instituted in many parts of the United States. As a result, imaging volumes plummeted while health care institutions worked to ensure safety measures were in place to protect patients and personnel. As COVID-19 infection levels started to stabilize in some areas, breast radiology practices sought guidance from national organizations, such as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, and radiology specialty societies, to develop strategies for patients to safely return for screening mammograms and other outpatient imaging studies. Postponement of breast cancer screening has led to delays in cancer diagnosis and treatment that could negatively affect patient outcomes for years to come. In order to continue to provide necessary imaging services, breast radiologists will need to face and overcome ongoing practical challenges related to the pandemic, such as negative financial impacts on practices and patients, the need for modifications in delivery of imaging services and trainee education, and differences in the health care system as a whole, including the shift to telehealth for clinical care. Nonetheless, despite the disruption the COVID-19 pandemic has caused, the need for breast radiology procedures, including breast cancer screening, remains strong.","Smetherman, Dana H",J Breast Imaging,188,1

The study is aimed at identifying reliable prognostic biomarkers and to improve understanding of cancer initiation and progression mechanisms. RNA-Seq data were downloaded from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. Subsequently, comprehensive bioinformatics analysis incorporating gene ontology (GO), Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG), and the protein-protein interaction (PPI) network was conducted to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) closely associated with NSCLC. Eight hub genes were screened out using Molecular Complex Detection (MCODE) and cytoHubba. The prognostic and diagnostic values of the hub genes were further confirmed by survival analysis and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. Hub genes were validated by other datasets, such as the Oncomine, Human Protein Atlas, and cBioPortal databases. Ultimately, logistic regression analysis was conducted to evaluate the diagnostic potential of the two identified biomarkers. Screening removed 1,411 DEGs, including 1,362 upregulated and 49 downregulated genes. Pathway enrichment analysis of the DEGs examined the Ras signaling pathway, alcoholism, and other factors. Ultimately, eight prioritized genes (GNGT1, GNG4, NMU, GCG, TAC1, GAST, GCGR1, and NPSR1) were identified as hub genes. High hub gene expression was significantly associated with worse overall survival in patients with NSCLC. The ROC curves showed that these hub genes had diagnostic value. The mRNA expressions of GNGT1 and NMU were low in the Oncomine database. Their protein expressions and genetic alterations were also revealed. Finally, logistic regression analysis indicated that combining the two biomarkers substantially improved the ability to discriminate NSCLC. GNGT1 and NMU identified in the current study may empower further discovery of the molecular mechanisms underlying NSCLC's initiation and progression.","Zhang, Jia-Jia; Hong, Jiang; Ma, Yu-Shui; Shi, Yi; Zhang, Dan-Dan; Yang, Xiao-Li; Jia, Cheng-You; Yin, Yu-Zhen; Jiang, Geng-Xi; Fu, Da; Yu, Fei",Dis Markers,188,16

In the literature, the use of fibrinolytics in hemothorax mostly pertained to the older fibrinolytics, such as streptokinase and urokinase. Recent studies describe the use of alteplase in these patients but mostly in the first days after the trauma, when it becomes clear that the first chest tube is not being effective. We report a case of residual traumatic hemothorax that could not be evacuated after multiple chest tubes placements and was finally cleared after instillation of alteplase late in the course of the disease.","Fernandes, Rita Martins; Varela, Miguel Lourenço; Moreno, Javier; Granja, Cristina",SN Compr Clin Med,188,1

Ambulant trauma surgery was minimised to reduce risk of contracting COVID-19. Operating capacity significantly reduced and surgical training dramatically curtailed. Locally, a private hospital has been utilised as a green site with consultant-lead trauma lists. Our aim is to review the safety and efficiency of this service. METHOD: Patients underwent pre-assessment, COVID-19 swabs and 7 days isolation pre and post-op. Staff also underwent swabbing. Prospectively data was gathered for all patients operated on at this site from 12/05/2020 to 20/08/2020. Records reviewed for readmission, complications and COVID status. A satisfaction questionnaire was sent to trainees who operated at this site. RESULTS: 79 operations were completed during this period. 50 male and 29 female, average age 49, average ASA 2. No complications or COVID-19 infections were recorded. Mean time to theatre was 18 days. Delays to theatre led to 2 complications. 87% of trainees felt training was maintained. CONCLUSIONS: Establishing a green site enabled efficient and safe management whilst still facilitating surgical training. This requires clear guidelines for staff and patients. We believe this model can help trauma service provision as the pandemic evolves.","Biggs, A; Moore, E; Zbaeda, M; Shah, K; Keightley, A",Br J Surg,188,16

We argue that several online mass-participation activities by Russians during the lockdown have grown into examples of contributive action. As a type of connective action, contributive action is based upon individual motivation to partake in unorganized personal action. However, its focus moves from connection-and-action (mostly impossible during lockdowns) to online projects where user participation-by-contribution turns an activity into socially and/or politically meaningful action. In Russia, activities based on contributive action, such as virtual protests or online Victory Day celebrations, came in place of connective action at a time when offline collectivity was unavailable or minor.

Main funding source(s): Part of this project was realized with financial support from the city of Antwerp in the context of the call ""Innovative solutions for Corona” BACKGROUND: During the first peak of the COVID-19 pandemic, face-to-face cardiology visits had to be replaced by teleconsultations but lacking the standard performed electrocardiogram. Instead, app-based monitoring of patients’ heart rate and rhythm using photoplethysmography (PPG) technology was available as an alternative to aid these teleconsultations. PURPOSE: Evaluation of the feasibility to initiate remotely PPG recordings with FibriCheck (Qompium, Hasselt, Belgium) and of the value of using FibriCheck before and after teleconsultation to substitute in-person arrhythmia consultations in three Belgian hospitals (Antwerp University Hospital, Heilig-Hart Hospital Lier and Jessa Hospital Hasselt). METHODS: Patients known with AF or with suspected arrhythmia symptoms during teleconsultation were contacted for the activation of FibriCheck seven days before or after a teleconsultation respectively, as shown in Figure 1. Instructions and a QR code were sent to the patients to download and activate FibriCheck. The code automatically links the application to an online platform available for the treating physician. Patients were asked to record their heart rhythm three times a day and when they experienced symptoms. RESULTS: In total, 92 patients (mean age: 64.7 ± 17.4) were contacted during the first COVID-19 peak, of which a total of 22 patients declined because not owing a smartphone or tablet (n = 11) or they were not willing or not capable to use FibriCheck (n = 11). A significant age difference was seen between the 22 non-participants versus the 70 participants (mean age 73.8 ± 18.7 vs. 61.9 ± 15.9; p = 0.004). Half of the patients, eligible for PPG monitoring (n = 38, 54.9%), were initiated before a planned (tele)consultation. Of these, four patients (10.5%) were diagnosed with an arrhythmia by using FibriCheck, of which two had frequent extrasystoles and two had a recurrence of AF and rate control was adapted. Of the 32 patients who used FibriCheck after a teleconsultation due to symptomatic palpitations, extrasystoles (n = 3) or high suspicion for a new AF diagnosis (n = 2) was established via FibriCheck. Early in-office evaluation was organised for the patients with a new diagnosis of AF, and rhythm control was initiated. In the majority of patients (57.1%), teleconsultation with FibriCheck was reassuring so that they could be followed-up according to their normal schedule. CONCLUSION: During the COVID-19 pandemic, cardiologists were able to obtain important additional information using the FibriCheck application when performing teleconsultations. The possibility to successfully complete teleconsultations using the FibriCheck data, and its broad applicability, create opportunities to implement FibriCheck in standard clinical practice as an easy tool to monitor patients before or after in-person consultations or even hospitalisations.","Knaepen, L; Delesie, M; De Meyer, T; Wildiers, A; Sarkozy, A; Saenen, J; Miljoen, H; Vijgen, J; Grieten, L; Linz, D; Desteghe, L; Heidbuchel, H",Eur J Cardiovasc Nurs,188,5

Social participation was determined from employment status, social network, and community activity. Binomial logistic regression multivariant analysis was performed to identify links between the measures of social participation and falls and frailty. RESULTS: The mean age of the 1383 participants was 68.5 years, with 57.1% female. Within the population, 22.9% were fallers and 9.3% were frail. Social isolation (OR= 2.119; 95% CI=1.351–3.324), and non-engagement in community activities (OR=2.548; 95% CI=1.107–5.865) were associated with increased frailty. Falls increased with social isolation (OR=1.327; 95% CI=1.004–1.754). CONCLUSIONS: Previous studies have shown social participation to be linked to frailty and falls risk, and social isolation to be a predictor of falls. In this study frailty was associated with all three social participation measures and history of falls was associated with social isolation.","Risbridger, S.; Walker, R.; Gray, W.

In a phenomenological study identifying strategies used to support families in vulnerable circumstances, we conducted nine focus groups to examine how early interventionists (EIs) described families and children, the language they used, and how they used it. Thematic qualitative analysis revealed three themes about families: perceptions of parenting, perceptions of capability, and perceptions of priorities. How EIs characterized families and their interactions with families were both reflective of and counter to family-centeredness and, at times, indicative of implicit bias. This study addresses a critical gap in the field, given the lack of empirical research available about implicit bias in early childhood intervention professionals. Implications for personnel preparation and practice change are discussed to begin the necessary work of moving the field toward more culturally sustaining practices.","Spence, Christine M.; Rooks-Ellis, Deborah L.; Ruiz, Amber Brown; Fish, Leigh Ann; Jones, Brooklin; O’Grady, Courtney E.; Sulinski, Ella",Early Child Educ J,188,12

Several studies have addressed the role of dendritic cells, macrophages, T cells, donor specific as well as anti-HLA antibodies, and interleukins in CLAD, but the expression and function of immune checkpoint molecules has not yet been analyzed, especially in the two CLAD subtypes: BOS (bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome) and RAS (restrictive allograft syndrome). To shed light on this topic, we conducted an observational study on eight consecutive grafts explanted from patients who received lung re-transplantation for CLAD. The expression of a panel of immune molecules (PD1/CD279, PDL1/CD274, CTLA4/CD152, CD4, CD8, hFoxp3, TIGIT, TOX, B-Cell-Specific Activator Protein) was analyzed by immunohistochemistry in these grafts and in six control lungs. Results showed that RAS compared to BOS grafts were characterized by 1) the inversion of the CD4/CD8 ratio; 2) a higher percentage of T lymphocytes expressing the PD-1, PD-L1, and CTLA4 checkpoint molecules; and 3) a significant reduction of exhausted PD-1-expressing T lymphocytes (PD-1(pos)/TOX(pos)) and of exhausted Treg (PD-1(pos)/FOXP3(pos)) T lymphocytes. Results herein, although being based on a limited number of cases, suggest a role for checkpoint molecules in the development of graft rejection and offer a possible immunological explanation for the worst prognosis of RAS. Our data, which will need to be validated in ampler cohorts of patients, raise the possibility that the evaluation of immune checkpoints during follow-up offers a prognostic advantage in monitoring the onset of rejection, and suggest that the use of compounds that modulate the function of checkpoint molecules could be evaluated in the management of chronic rejection in LTx patients.","Righi, Ilaria; Vaira, Valentina; Morlacchi, Letizia Corinna; Croci, Giorgio Alberto; Rossetti, Valeria; Blasi, Francesco; Ferrero, Stefano; Nosotti, Mario; Rosso, Lorenzo; Clerici, Mario",Front Immunol,188,16

The purpose of this study was to develop and validate a PBGEC scale (PBGECS) for Chinese community residents and university students. A total of 1,408 residents from Chongqing completed the survey of PBGECS, the present social attitude scale, the future social expectations scale, and the social wellbeing scale, which constituted Sample 1; A total of 607 college students from Nanchang completed the survey of PBGECS and the Positive and Negative Affect Scale, which constituted Sample 2. Exploratory factor analysis revealed a two-factor structure, including positive PBGEC (PBGEC-P) and negative PBGEC (PBGEC-N). Internal consistency was strong for each factor and the full-scale (α ≥ 0.83). Confirmatory factor analysis showed that the correlated two-factor model of PBGEC and the four-factor model (including PBGEC-P, PBGEC-N, individual positive affect, and individual negative affect) demonstrated the best fit to the data, which supported the structural validity of the PBGECS. The interpretive validity, cultural validity, and population validity of the scale were also proved by examining the relationship between PBGEC and socioeconomic status, social attitude, and social wellbeing, respectively. The results show that the PBGECS demonstrated satisfactory reliability and validity, which can be used to assesses the perceived emotion climate of an individual’s surrounding environment.","Yang, Xiao-juan; Wang, Xin-qiang; Liu, Jian-ping; Lai, Song-hai; Liu, Mingfan; Ye, Baojuan",Front Psychol,188,0

This study aimed to determine an injury criterion and accompanying tolerance values for cervical spine segments in axial compression applied with varying coronal plane eccentricity. Thirty-three human cadaveric functional spinal units were subjected to axial compression at three magnitudes of lateral eccentricity of the applied force. Injury was identified by high-speed video and graded by spine surgeons. Linear regression was used to define neck injury tolerance values based on a criterion incorporating coronal plane loads accounting for specimen sex, age, size and bone density. Larger coronal plane eccentricity at injury was associated with smaller resultant coronal plane force. The level of coronal plane eccentricity at failure appears to distinguish between the types of injuries sustained, with hard tissue structure injuries more common at low levels of eccentricity and soft tissue structure injuries more common at high levels of eccentricity. There was no relationship between axial force and lateral bending moment at injury which has been previously proposed as an injury criterion. These results provide the foundation for designing and evaluating strategies and devices for preventing severe spinal injuries.","Whyte, Tom; Melnyk, Angela D; Van Toen, Carolyn; Yamamoto, Shun; Street, John; Oxland, Thomas R; Cripton, Peter A",Scientific reports,188,17

Due to their malignant potential, surgical resection is the recommended method for management of these tumours. Many reports have described the ability to excise small and medium sized GISTs laparoscopically, but laparoscopic resection of GISTs greater than 5 cm is still a matter of debate. AIM To investigate the feasibility and effectiveness of laparoscopic surgical techniques for management of large gastric GISTs greater than 4 cm and to detail characteristics of this type of tumour. MATERIAL AND METHODS The study cohort consisted of 11 patients with suspected gastric GISTs who were treated from 2011 to April 2014 in a single institution. All patients underwent laparoscopic resection of a gastric GIST. RESULTS Eleven patients underwent laparoscopic resection of a suspected gastric GIST between April 2011 and April 2014. The cohort consisted of 6 males and 5 females. Mean age was 67 years (range: 43-92 years). Sixty-four percent of these patients presented with symptomatic tumours. Four (36.4%) patients underwent laparoscopic transgastric resection (LTR), 3 (27.3%) laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG), 3 (27.3%) laparoscopic wedge resection (LWR) and 1 (9%) laparoscopic distal gastrectomy (LDG). The mean operative time was 215 min. The mean tumour size was 6 cm (range: 4-9 cm). The mean tumour size for LTR was 5.5 cm (range: 4-6.3 cm), for LWR 5.3 cm (range: 4.5-7 cm), for LSG 6.5 cm (range: 4-9 cm) and for LDG 9 cm. We experienced only minor postoperative complications. CONCLUSIONS Laparoscopic procedures can be successfully performed during management of large gastric GISTs, bigger than 4 cm, and should be considered for all non-metastatic cases. The appropriate approach can be determined by assessing the anatomical location of each tumour.","Smolarek, Sebastian; Pomeroy, Eoghan; Kinnarney, Fiona; Arumugasamy, Mayilone",Wideochirurgia i inne techniki maloinwazyjne = Videosurgery and other miniinvasive techniques,188,16

RESULTS Forty-one patients underwent 82 combined procedures using TUSPLS in a single session. The perioperative outcomes of simultaneously performed cholecystectomy and ovarian cystectomy using TUSPLS (n = 14) are compared with those of using CLS (n = 11). The operating time was significantly longer with the TUSPLS method than with the CLS method. However, postoperative convalescent outcomes such as postoperative hospital stay, VAS pain score, and required analgesics showed no differences between the two methods. Also, there were no significant operative complications associated with the two methods. Fewer trocars were used with the TUSPLS method.

Currently, tracheal aspirate (TA) serves as the gold standard collection modality in critically ill newborns, but this method remains invasive. We tested the hypothesis that glutathione status would positively correlate between EBC and TA collections in intubated newborns in the Newborn Intensive Care Unit (NICU). We also hypothesized that these measurements would be associated with alveolar macrophage (AM) glutathione status in the newborn lung. METHODS Reduced glutathione (rGSH), glutathione disulfide (GSSG), and total GSH (rGSH + (2 X GSSG)) were measured in sequential EBC and TA samples from 26 intubated newborns via high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Additionally, AM glutathione was evaluated via immunofluorescence. Pearson's correlation coefficient and associated 95% confidence intervals were used to quantify the associations between raw and urea-corrected concentrations in EBC and TA samples and AM staining. Statistical significance was defined as p ≤ 0.05 using two-tailed tests. The sample size was projected to allow for a correlation coefficient of 0.5, with 0.8 power and alpha of 0.05. RESULTS EBC was obtainable from intubated newborns without adverse clinical events. EBC samples demonstrated moderate to strong positive correlations with TA samples in terms of rGSH, GSSG and total GSH. Positive correlations between the two sampling sites were observed in both raw and urea-corrected concentrations of rGSH, GSSG and total GSH. AM glutathione staining moderately correlated with GSSG and total GSH status in both the TA and EBC. CONCLUSIONS GSH status in EBC samples of intubated newborns significantly correlated with the GSH status of the TA sample and was reflective of cellular GSH status in this cohort of neonatal patients. Non-invasive EBC sampling of intubated newborns holds promise for monitoring antioxidant status such as GSH in the premature lung. Further studies are necessary to evaluate the potential relationships between EBC biomarkers in the intubated premature newborn and respiratory morbidities.","Rosso, Maria I; Roark, Susan; Taylor, Esther; Ping, XiaoDu; Ward, Janine M; Roche, Katherine; McCracken, Courtney; Brown, Lou Ann S; Gauthier, Theresa W",Respiratory research,188,1

METHODS We reviewed the clinical data of 566 patients treated by 836 endovascular femoropopliteal interventions for lower extremity claudication (46%) or critical limb ischemia (54%) from 2002 to 2012. Outcomes were analyzed in 74 patients/87 interventions performed with EPDs (Spider Rx; Covidien, Plymouth, Minn) and 513 patients/749 interventions performed without EPDs. TransAtlantic Inter-Society Consensus (TASC) II classification, runoff scores, and embolic events were analyzed. End points were morbidity, mortality, reintervention, patency, and major amputation rates. RESULTS Both groups had similar demographics, indications, cardiovascular risk factors, and runoff scores, but patients treated with EPDs had significantly (P < .05) longer lesions (109 ± 94 mm vs 85 ± 76 mm) and more often had occlusions (64% vs 30%) and TASC C/D lesions (56% vs 30%). Embolic events occurred in 35 of 836 interventions (4%), including two (2%) performed with EPD and 33 (4%) without EPD (P = .35). Macroscopic debris was noted in 59 (68%) filter baskets. Embolic events were not associated with lesion length, TASC classification, runoff scores, treatment type, or indication but were independently associated with occlusion. Patients who had embolization required more reinterventions (20% vs 3%; P < .001) and major amputations at 30 days (11% vs 3%; P = .02). There was no difference in hospital stay (2.4 ± 4 days vs 1.6 ± 2 days; P = .08), reintervention (2% vs 4%), and major amputation (1% vs 4%) among patients treated with or without EPD, respectively. The two patients who developed embolization with EPDs had no clinical sequela and required no reintervention. Most emboli were successfully treated by catheter aspiration or thrombolysis, but eight patients (24%) treated without EPD required prolonged hospital stay, seven (21%) had multiple reinterventions, one (3%) had unanticipated major amputation, and one (3%) died from hemorrhagic complications of thrombolysis. Median follow-up was 20 months. At 2 years, primary patency and freedom from reintervention was similar for TASC A/B and TASC C/D lesions treated with or without EPDs. CONCLUSIONS Rates of embolization are low in patients undergoing endovascular femoropopliteal interventions with (4%) or without (2%) EPD. Embolization is more frequent in patients with occlusions. While emboli in patients with EPD had no clinical sequel, those treated without EPD required multiple reinterventions in 21% or resulted in major amputation or death in 3%. Late outcomes were similar in patients treated with or without EPDs.","Mendes, Bernardo C; Oderich, Gustavo S; Fleming, Mark D; Misra, Sanjay; Duncan, Audra A; Kalra, Manju; Cha, Stephen; Gloviczki, Peter",Journal of vascular surgery,188,1

A viral nucleic acid test is used for the diagnosis of COVID-19, and some hematological indicators have been used in the auxiliary diagnosis and identification of the severity of COVID-19. Regarding body fluid samples, except for being used for nucleic acid testing, the relationship between COVID-19 and routine body fluid parameters is not known. Our aim was to investigate the value of urine biochemical parameters in the prediction of the severity of COVID-19. Methods A total of 119 patients with COVID-19 were enrolled at Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University. According to the severity of COVID-19, the patients were divided into three groups (moderate 67, severe 42 and critical 10), and 45 healthy persons were enrolled in the same period as healthy controls. The relationship between the results of urine biochemical parameters and the severity of COVID-19 was analyzed. Results The positive rates of urine occult blood (BLOOD) and proteinuria (PRO) were higher in COVID-19 patients than in healthy controls (p < 0.05); the urine specific gravity (SG) value was lower in patients than in healthy controls (p < 0.05), and the urine potential of hydrogen (pH) value was higher in patients than in healthy controls (p < 0.01). The positive rates of urine glucose (GLU-U) and PRO in the severe and critical groups were higher than those in the moderate group (p < 0.01 and p < 0.05, respectively); other biochemical parameters of urine were not associated with the severity of COVID-19. Conclusions Some urine biochemical parameters are different between patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV-2 and healthy controls, and GLU-U and PRO may be helpful for the differentiation of COVID-19 severity.","Liu, Rui; Ma, Qingfeng; Han, Huan; Su, Hanwen; Liu, Fang; Wu, Kailang; Wang, Wei; Zhu, Chengliang",Clinical chemistry and laboratory medicine,188,1

MATERIAL AND METHOD Following IRB approval, a retrospective evaluation of the treatment of 20 patients with 75 melanoma liver metastases was performed. RESULTS A median number of 2 lesions (range 1-14) per patient with a median size of 1.7 cm (range 0.5-14.5 cm) were treated. 67 lesions were <3 cm (89.3 %) and 8 lesions were >3 cm (10.7 %). Per patient a median of 1 ablation session was performed (range: 1-4) totaling 34 sessions. There were no procedure-related deaths and all major complications (n = 3) could be easily treated by pleural drainages. The primary and secondary success rates were 89.3 and 93.3 %, respectively. The overall local recurrence rate was 13.3 %. Four of ten local recurrences were re-treated successfully by SRFA. During follow-up, 9/20 patients developed extrahepatic metastatic disease and 10/20 had liver recurrence at any location. The median OS from the date of SRFA was 19.3 months, with an OS of 64, 41, and 17 % at 1, 3, and 5 years, with no significant difference for patients with cutaneous and ocular melanoma. The median DFS after SRFA for all 20 patients was 9.5 months, with 37, 9, and 0 % at 1, 3, and 5 years.

The authors hypothesized that the choice of neuromuscular blockade reversal (neostigmine vs. sugammadex) may be associated with a lower incidence of major pulmonary complications. METHODS Twelve U.S. Multicenter Perioperative Outcomes Group hospitals were included in a multicenter observational matched-cohort study of surgical cases between January 2014 and August 2018. Adult patients undergoing elective inpatient noncardiac surgical procedures with general anesthesia and endotracheal intubation receiving a nondepolarizing neuromuscular blockade agent and reversal were included. Exact matching criteria included institution, sex, age, comorbidities, obesity, surgical procedure type, and neuromuscular blockade agent (rocuronium vs. vecuronium). Other preoperative and intraoperative factors were compared and adjusted in the case of residual imbalance. The composite primary outcome was major postoperative pulmonary complications, defined as pneumonia, respiratory failure, or other pulmonary complications (including pneumonitis; pulmonary congestion; iatrogenic pulmonary embolism, infarction, or pneumothorax). Secondary outcomes focused on the components of pneumonia and respiratory failure. RESULTS Of 30,026 patients receiving sugammadex, 22,856 were matched to 22,856 patients receiving neostigmine. Out of 45,712 patients studied, 1,892 (4.1%) were diagnosed with the composite primary outcome (3.5% sugammadex vs. 4.8% neostigmine). A total of 796 (1.7%) patients had pneumonia (1.3% vs. 2.2%), and 582 (1.3%) respiratory failure (0.8% vs. 1.7%). In multivariable analysis, sugammadex administration was associated with a 30% reduced risk of pulmonary complications (adjusted odds ratio, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.63 to 0.77), 47% reduced risk of pneumonia (adjusted odds ratio, 0.53; 95% CI, 0.44 to 0.62), and 55% reduced risk of respiratory failure (adjusted odds ratio, 0.45; 95% CI, 0.37 to 0.56), compared to neostigmine. CONCLUSIONS Among a generalizable cohort of adult patients undergoing inpatient surgery at U.S. hospitals, the use of sugammadex was associated with a clinically and statistically significant lower incidence of major pulmonary complications. : WHAT WE ALREADY KNOW ABOUT THIS TOPIC: Approximately 5% of patients experience a major pulmonary complication after noncardiac surgeryInadequate reversal of neuromuscular blockade increases the risk of pulmonary complicationsIn the United States, sugammadex is used with similar frequency as neostigmine at many hospitalsSugammadex provides more rapid and effective restoration of neuromuscular tone without systemic anticholinergic activity; however, neostigmine currently remains the mainstay of practice WHAT THIS ARTICLE TELLS US THAT IS NEW: In a multicenter observational matched cohort study of noncardiac surgery, sugammadex administration was associated with a 30% reduced risk of pulmonary complications, a 47% reduced risk of pneumonia, and a 55% reduced risk of respiratory failure compared to neostigmine.","Kheterpal, Sachin; Vaughn, Michelle T; Dubovoy, Timur Z; Shah, Nirav J; Bash, Lori D; Colquhoun, Douglas A; Shanks, Amy M; Mathis, Michael R; Soto, Roy G; Bardia, Amit; Bartels, Karsten; McCormick, Patrick J; Schonberger, Robert B; Saager, Leif",Anesthesiology,188,1

However, procedures involving double stenting in Y/X configurations carry a relatively high risk of procedural complications. The Neuroform ATLAS, the evolution of Neuroform EZ, is a nitinol self-expanding hybrid/open cell stent which can be delivered through a low profile 0.017 inch catheter. We present our experience in the treatment of intracranial aneurysms with this stent in Y and X configurations. MATERIALS AND METHODS We prospectively maintained a database from consecutive patients who underwent double stent assisted coiling with the Neuroform ATLAS, from July 2015 to February 2019. Clinical and angiographic results were analyzed. RESULTS 55 patients harboring 55 bifurcation aneurysms were treated with double stenting: 52 'Y' configurations, 3 'X' configurations. Deployment was successful in all cases. Post-treatment control angiography showed complete occlusion in 33 cases (60%), neck remnant in 8 cases (14.5%), and incomplete occlusion in 14 cases (25.4%). The overall symptomatic periprocedural complication rate was 12.7%. 38 aneurysms underwent follow-up (69%, mean duration 16 months): 33 aneurysms (87%) were completely occluded, 3 aneurysms (8%) had a neck remnant, and 2 aneurysms (5%) were incompletely occluded. CONCLUSION The Neuroform ATLAS is an effective device for treatment of bifurcation aneurysms, allowing good conformability, a high level of navigability, and easy mesh crossing to perform Y/X stenting procedures. The rate of procedural complications remains non-negligible, and an indication for a double stenting procedure should be carefully discussed in a multidisciplinary meeting.","Ciccio, Gabriele; Robert, Thomas; Smajda, Stanislas; Fahed, Robert; Desilles, Jean Philippe; Redjem, Hocine; Escalard, Simon; Mazighi, Mikael; Blanc, Raphael; Piotin, Michel",Journal of neurointerventional surgery,188,1

The basis of this debate has focused on the clinical relevance of opposite problems. Historically, the term ""disuse atrophy"" has described a situation wherein sustained inactivity of the respiratory muscles (ie, passive ventilation) results in deconditioning and weakness. More recently it has been referred to as ""ventilator-induced diaphragmatic dysfunction."" In contrast, ""use atrophy"" describes a situation where chronic high-tension inspiratory work causes structural damage to the diaphragm and weakness. Both laboratory and clinical studies demonstrated that relatively brief periods of complete respiratory muscle inactivity, as well as intense muscle loading, result in acute inflammation, loss of muscle mass, and weakness. Yet in critical illness other factors also affect respiratory muscle function, including prolonged use of neuromuscular blocking agents, administration of corticosteroids, and sepsis. This makes the attribution of acquired respiratory muscle weakness and ventilator-dependence to either ventilator-induced diaphragmatic dysfunction or loaded breathing extremely difficult. Regardless, the clinical implications of this research strongly suggest that passive mechanical ventilation should be avoided whenever possible. However, promotion of unassisted spontaneous breathing in the acute phase of critical illness also may carry a substantial risk of respiratory muscle injury and weakness. Use of mechanical ventilation modes in a manner that induces spontaneous breathing effort, while simultaneously reducing the work load on the respiratory muscles, is probably sufficient to minimize both problems.","Kallet, Richard H",Respiratory care,188,31

Here, we report that deletion of Mettl14 dramatically reduces mRNA m6A methylation in developing B cells and severely blocks B cell development in mice. Deletion of Mettl14 impairs interleukin-7 (IL-7)-induced pro-B cell proliferation and the large-pre-B-to-small-pre-B transition and causes dramatic abnormalities in gene expression programs important for B cell development. Suppression of a group of transcripts by cytoplasmic m6A reader YTHDF2 is critical to the IL-7-induced pro-B cell proliferation. In contrast, the block in the large-pre-B-to-small-pre-B transition is independent of YTHDF1 or YTHDF2 but is associated with a failure to properly upregulate key transcription factors regulating this transition.

We assessed the association of aHG (≥144 mg/dl) with outcomes stratified by DM history using propensity score matched (PSM) data from the SITS-ISTR. The primary safety outcome was symptomatic intracranial haemorrhage (SICH); three-month functional independence (FI;mRS scores 0-2) represented the primary efficacy outcome. Patients with and without aHG did not differ in baseline characteristics both in the non-diabetic (n=12,318) and diabetic (n=6,572) PSM subgroups. In the non-DM group, patients with aHG had lower 3-month FI (53.3% vs. 57.9%,p<0.001) rates, higher 3-month mortality rates (19.2% vs. 16.0%,p<0.001) and similar SICH rates (1.7% vs. 1.8%,p=0.563) compared to patients without aHG. Similarly, in the DM group, patients with aHG had lower rates of 3-month favourable functional outcome (mRS scores 0-1, 34.1% vs. 39.3%,p<0.001) and FI (48.2% vs. 52.5%,p<0.001), higher 3-month mortality rates (23.7% vs. 19.9%,p<0.001) and similar SICH rates (2.2% vs. 2.7%,p=0.224) compared to patients without aHG. In conclusion, aHG was associated with unfavorable 3 month clinical outcomes in both diabetic and non-diabetic AIS patients treated with IVT.","Tsivgoulis, Georgios; Katsanos, Aristeidis H; Mavridis, Dimitris; Lambadiari, Vaia; Roffe, Christine; Macleod, Mary Joan; Sevcik, Petr; Cappellari, Manuel; Nevšímalová, Miroslava; Toni, Danilo; Ahmed, Niaz",Diabetes,188,1

This study was based on the OCCLUDE 1 Study Protocol approved by the Local Ethics Committee. MATERIALS AND METHODS A prospective study carried out in June and July 2014 included 12 women aged 21-48 years (mean 31 years) scheduled for PCS embolization using the ArtVentive EOS™. The inclusion criteria were clinical symptoms of PCS documented by transvaginal Doppler ultrasound and pelvic MRI. The pelvic pain was assessed by VAS score from 0 to 10 (0 represents lack of pain and 10 unbearable pain). A decrease in pelvic pain intensity based on the VAS was considered a clinical success. RESULTS Successful embolization procedures with ArtVentive EOS™ were performed in 11 out of 12 patients. Nine patients underwent unilateral embolization of the left ovarian vein, and two had bilateral embolization of the ovarian veins. Complete ovarian vein occlusion confirmed by post deployment venography was achieved in all 11 patients. Procedures lasted from 19 to 45 min (average 28 min). Pain intensity decrease was observed in all 11 patients-a decrease of 5.6 points-from 7.3 pre-procedure to 1.6 post-embolization (standard deviation: 0.67). In one case, the left ovarian vein was injured by guide wire manipulation with contrast extravasation-not clinically significant. CONCLUSIONS The use of ArtVentive EOS™ for occlusion of the ovarian veins in PCS patients is safe and effective.","Pyra, Krzysztof; Woźniak, Sławomir; Drelich-Zbroja, Anna; Wolski, Andrzej; Jargiełło, Tomasz",Cardiovascular and interventional radiology,188,12

METHOD A retrospective study of 11,848 THAs and 18,972 TKAs (2001-2002) was conducted. Death within 90 days and 1 year of the surgery were the main endpoints. Co-morbidity measures were calculated using either medication or hospitalisation history. Logistic regression models were employed and discrimination and calibration were assessed. Specifically, models with unweighted and weighted measure scores, models with the specific conditions, and a model combining conditions identified by all measures were assessed. RESULTS In THAs, the best performing prediction models included co-morbidities from all three measures (90 days: c = 0.84, P = 0.284, 1 year: c = 0.79, P = 0.158). Individually, the model with Charlson conditions performed best at 90 days mortality (c = 0.80, P = 0.777) and the Charlson and Elixhauser performed similarly at 1 year (both c = 0.77, P > 0.05). In TKAs, the best performing prediction model included co-morbidities from all measures (90 days: c = 0.82, P = 0.349, 1 year: c = 0.78, P = 0.873). Individually, the model with Elixhauser conditions performed best with 90 days mortality (c = 0.79, P = 0.435) and all performed similarly at 1 year (c = 0.74-0.75, all P > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS A combined model with co-morbidities identified by the Elixhauser, Charlson, and RxRisk-V was the best mortality prediction model. The RxRisk-V did not perform as well as the others. Because of the Elixhauser and Charlson's similar performance we suggest basing the choice of measurement use on factors such as the need of specific conditions and modelling limitations.","Inacio, M C S; Pratt, N L; Roughead, E E; Graves, S E",Osteoarthritis and cartilage,188,1

We aimed to characterize skeletal muscle mitochondrial changes in response to a ketogenic diet combined with exercise training in healthy individuals. Twenty-nine physically active adults completed a 12-week supervised exercise program after self-selection into a ketogenic diet (KD, n=15) group or maintenance of their habitual mixed diet (MD, n=14). Measures of metabolic health and muscle biopsies (Vastus lateralis) were obtained before and after the intervention. Mitochondria were isolated from muscle and studied after exposure to carbohydrate (pyruvate), fat (palmitoyl-L-carnitine), and ketone (β-hydroxybutyrate+acetoacetate) substrates. Compared to MD, the KD resulted in increased whole-body resting fat oxidation (p<0.001) and decreased fasting insulin (p=0.019), insulin resistance (HOMA-IR, p=0.022), and visceral fat (p<0.001). The KD altered mitochondrial function as evidenced by increases in mitochondrial respiratory control ratio (19%, p=0.009), ATP production (36%, p=0.028), and ATP/H2O2 (36%, p=0.033) with the fat-based substrate. ATP production with the ketone-based substrate was 4 to 8 times lower than with other substrates, indicating minimal oxidation. The KD resulted in a small decrease in muscle glycogen (14%, p=0.035) and an increase in muscle triglyceride (81%, p=0.006). These results expand our understanding of human adaptation to a ketogenic diet combined with exercise. In conjunction with weight loss, we observed altered skeletal muscle mitochondrial function and efficiency, an effect that may contribute to the therapeutic use of ketogenic diets in various clinical conditions, especially those associated with insulin resistance.","Miller, Vincent J; LaFountain, Richard A; Barnhart, Emily; Sapper, Teyrn S; Short, Jay; Arnold, William David; Hyde, Parker N; Crabtree, Christopher D; Kackley, Madison L; Kraemer, William J; Villamena, Frederick; Volek, Jeffrey S",American journal of physiology.

Recent studies in the literature as well as dramatic changes in clinical practice over the past decade, though, would suggest that such a precise measure by IC to set energy goals is not required to maximize clinical benefit from early feeding in the intensive care unit (ICU). Results from randomized controlled trials evaluating permissive underfeeding, use of supplemental parenteral nutrition to achieve tight calorie control, and caloric density of formulas to increase energy delivery have provided an important perspective on 3 pertinent issues. First, a simple weight-based predictive equation (25 kcal/kg/day) provides a clinically useful approximation of EE. Second, a precise measure of EE by IC does not appear to improve outcomes compared with use of this less accurate estimation of energy requirements. And third, providing some percentage of requirements (50%-80%), achieves similar clinical benefit to full feeding (100%) in the early phases of critical illness. The value from IC use lies in the determination of caloric requirements in conditions for which weight-based equations are rendered inaccurate (anasarca, amputation, severe obesity) or the clinical state is markedly altered (such as the prolonged hyperinflammatory state of coronavirus disease 2019 [COVID-19]). In most other circumstances, routine use of IC would not be expected to change clinical outcomes from early nutrition therapy in the ICU.","McClave, Stephen A; Omer, Endashaw",Nutrition in clinical practice : official publication of the American Society for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition,188,1

A similar, structured approach appears to improve outcomes, including mortality, for patients undergoing high-risk emergency general surgery, and specifically emergency laparotomy. These are the first consensus guidelines for optimal care of these patients using an ERAS approach. METHODS Experts in aspects of management of the high-risk and emergency general surgical patient were invited to contribute by the International ERAS® Society. Pubmed, Cochrane, Embase, and MEDLINE database searches on English language publications were performed for ERAS elements and relevant specific topics. Studies on each item were selected with particular attention to randomized controlled trials, systematic reviews, meta-analyses and large cohort studies, and reviewed and graded using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) system. Recommendations were made on the best level of evidence, or extrapolation from studies on non-emergency patients when appropriate. The Delphi method was used to validate final recommendations. The guideline has been divided into two parts: Part 1-Preoperative Care and Part 2-Intraoperative and Postoperative management. This paper provides guidelines for Part 1. RESULTS Twelve components of preoperative care were considered. Consensus was reached after three rounds. CONCLUSIONS These guidelines are based on the best available evidence for an ERAS approach to patients undergoing emergency laparotomy. Initial management is particularly important for patients with sepsis and physiological derangement.

Macadamia is one of Malawi's most important and profitable crop species; however, climate change threatens its production. Thus, this study's objective is to quantitatively examine the potential impacts of climate change on the climate suitability for macadamia in Malawi. We utilized an ensemble model approach to predict the current and future (2050s) suitability of macadamia under two Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs). We achieved a good model fit in determining suitability classes for macadamia (AUC = 0.9). The climatic variables that strongly influence macadamia's climatic suitability in Malawi are suggested to be the precipitation of the driest month (29.1%) and isothermality (17.3%). Under current climatic conditions, 57% (53,925 km2) of Malawi is climatically suitable for macadamia. Future projections suggest that climate change will decrease the suitable areas for macadamia by 18% (17,015 km2) and 21.6% (20,414 km2) based on RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5, respectively, with the distribution of suitability shifting northwards in the 2050s. The southern and central regions of the country will suffer the greatest losses (≥ 8%), while the northern region will be the least impacted (4%). We conclude that our study provides critical evidence that climate change will reduce the suitable areas for macadamia production in Malawi, depending on climate drivers. Therefore area-specific adaptation strategies are required to build resilience among producers.","Zuza, Emmanuel Junior; Maseyk, Kadmiel; Bhagwat, Shonil A; de Sousa, Kauê; Emmott, Andrew; Rawes, William; Araya, Yoseph Negusse",PloS one,188,1

Innovative avenues for treatment are highly warranted. Methods and results: Novel work with biological clock genes that oversee circadian rhythm may meet this critical need by focusing upon the pathways of the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR), the silent mating type information regulation 2 homolog 1 (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) (SIRT1), mammalian forkhead transcription factors (FoxOs), the growth factor erythropoietin (EPO), and the wingless Wnt pathway. These pathways are complex in nature, intimately associated with autophagy that can maintain circadian rhythm, and have an intricate relationship that can lead to beneficial outcomes that may offer neuroprotection, metabolic homeostasis, and prevention of cognitive loss. However, biological clocks and alterations in circadian rhythm also have the potential to lead to devastating effects involving tumorigenesis in conjunction with pathways involving Wnt that oversee angiogenesis and stem cell proliferation. Conclusions: Current work with biological clocks and circadian rhythm pathways provide exciting possibilities for the treating dementia and cognitive loss, but also provide powerful arguments to further comprehend the intimate and complex relationship among these pathways to fully potentiate desired clinical outcomes.","Maiese, Kenneth",Frontiers in bioscience,188,24

Because of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, our institution noted a significant decline in the number of patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage presenting to the hospital. We report one such example of a patient who developed new-onset severe headache and vomiting and did not seek medical attention because of COVID-19. Two months later, she was noted to have ptosis during a routine follow-up and was found to have a complete, pupil-involving third nerve palsy. Computed tomography angiography was performed and revealed an irregular bilobed saccular aneurysm (7 × 9 × 5 mm) of the right posterior communicating (PComm) artery, but no acute hemorrhage was visible on CT. On MRI, immediately adjacent to the aneurysm, there was a small subacute hematoma in the right medial temporal lobe with surrounding vasogenic edema. This case had a fortunate and unique outcome as she had a contained hematoma adjacent to the ruptured PComm aneurysm and did not experience severe morbidity from the subarachnoid hemorrhage nor did she rebleed in the interval in which she did not seek care. This case highlights the importance of providing neuro-ophthalmic care even during a pandemic.","Dhoot, Arjan S; Guest, William C; Bharatha, Aditya; Micieli, Jonathan A",Journal of neuro-ophthalmology : the official journal of the North American Neuro-Ophthalmology Society,188,1

As such, relapse prevention is an essential therapeutic outcome for people with SMI. Mental health nurses (MHNs) are well placed to support individuals with SMI and to prevent relapse; notwithstanding, there has been no synthesis of the evidence to date to determine whether MHNs prevent relapse in this population. METHODS Electronic databases will be systemically searched for observational studies and clinical trials that report the association between mental health nursing and the hospitalisation of persons living with an SMI. The search will be supplemented by reference checking and a search of the grey literature. The primary outcome of interest will be hospital admission rate. Screening of articles, data extraction and critical appraisal will be undertaken by two reviewers, independently, with a third reviewer consulted should disagreement occur between reviewers. The quality of studies will be assessed using the Risk Of Bias In Non-randomised Studies - of Interventions (ROBINS-I) tool and the Cochrane Collaboration risk of bias tool. Depending on the number of studies and level of heterogeneity, the evidence may be synthesised using meta-analysis or narrative synthesis. DISCUSSION This review will explore for the first time the clinical potential of mental health nursing in preventing relapse in persons with SMI.

66227,66227,66227,An Evidence-Based Strategy to Scale Vaccination in Canada.,14.727851,5.8172083,2021-04-01,"BACKGROUND Although both anatomic double-bundle and single-bundle anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction procedures are in use, it remains controversial whether the anatomic double-bundle procedure is biomechanically superior. HYPOTHESIS The anatomic double-bundle procedure would be better than both laterally placed anatomic and nonanatomic transtibial single-bundle procedures at restoring to normal the tibial anterior translation, internal rotation, and pivot-shift instability. It was also hypothesized that tibial internal rotation would be closer to normal after laterally placed anatomic single-bundle reconstruction than after the nonanatomic reconstruction. STUDY DESIGN Controlled laboratory study. METHODS Eight cadaveric knees were mounted in a 6 degrees of freedom rig and tested using the following loading conditions: 90-N anterior and posterior tibial forces, 5-N·m internal and external tibial rotation torques, and a simulated pivot-shift test. Tibiofemoral kinematics during the flexion-extension cycle were recorded with an optical tracking system for (1) intact, (2) anterior cruciate ligament-deficient knee, (3) anatomic double-bundle reconstruction, (4) nonanatomic single-bundle reconstruction, and (5) laterally placed single-bundle reconstruction. RESULTS Rotational laxity with internal tibial torque and anterior laxity in the simulated pivot shift were significantly less in the double-bundle reconstruction and laterally placed single-bundle reconstruction compared with the nonanatomic single-bundle reconstruction. There were no significant differences between the 3 procedures when anterior and posterior tibial translation forces and external rotation torques were applied. In addition, there were no significant differences between the double-bundle reconstruction and laterally placed single-bundle reconstruction. CONCLUSION The postoperative rotational and pivot-shift laxity after anatomic double-bundle anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction was significantly better than that after nonanatomic single-bundle reconstruction. However, there were no significant differences between the double-bundle reconstruction and laterally placed single-bundle reconstruction. CLINICAL RELEVANCE This work suggests that a single-bundle reconstruction may be better able to control both knee laxity and pivot-shift instability if the femoral tunnel is moved to a more lateral position and that then the double-bundle reconstruction may not offer significant further advantages.","Kondo, Eiji; Merican, Azhar M; Yasuda, Kazunori; Amis, Andrew A",The American journal of sports medicine,188,1

METHODS In a 2-month prospective, observational, resident-led nationwide cohort study, patients undergoing laparoscopic appendectomy for both uncomplicated and complicated appendicitis were analysed. Logistic regression analyses were performed for identifying the possible effect of stump closure type and other risk factors for infectious complications. RESULTS Laparoscopic appendectomy for acute appendicitis was performed in 1369 patients in 62 hospitals; endoloops were used in 76.7 % and an endostapler in other patients. Median operating time was not different between endoloop and endostapler use (42.0 vs. 44.0 min, P = 0.243). A superficial surgical site infection was seen in 2.0 % after uncomplicated appendicitis and in 0.8 % after complicated appendicitis. The intra-abdominal abscess rate was 1.9 % after uncomplicated and 11.0 % after complicated appendicitis. No significant effect of stump closure type was observed for any infectious complication (OR 1.05; 95 % CI 0.625-1.766, P = 0.853) or an intra-abdominal abscess (OR OR 0.96; 95 % CI 0.523-1.768, P = 0.899). In multivariable analysis, complicated appendicitis was identified as the only independent risk factor for an intra-abdominal abscess (OR 6.26; 95 % CI 3.454-11.341, P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS The infectious complication rate is not influenced by the type of appendicular stump closure with either endoloops or an endostapler in this study. If technically feasible, closure with endoloops is advised for cost considerations.","van Rossem, Charles C; van Geloven, Anna A W; Schreinemacher, Marc H F; Bemelman, Willem A",Surgical endoscopy,188,26

Subjective factors can make supplying appropriate ventilation difficult. Capnography is not routinely used when ventilating nonintubated patients. Our objective was to determine if providers were able to maintain normal capnography values with BVM ventilation in pediatric patients based on clinical skills alone. METHODS Providers (nurses, residents, and fellows) delivered 2 minutes of BVM respiratory support to healthy children during induction of anesthesia for elective surgery. All patients had standard monitoring including capnography, but providers were blinded to capnography data. Capnography data were video recorded; values between 30 and 50 mmHg were considered indicative of normal ventilation. Any deviation from this range for greater than 10 consecutive seconds was considered an episode of inappropriate ventilation. MAIN RESULTS Twenty-five providers-patient pairs were enrolled. Nineteen providers were anesthesia residents. The median age of patients was 5.3 years (interquartile range, 3.3-8.5 years). Nineteen providers (76%) had at least 1 episode of abnormal ventilation with a median of 2 episodes per provider (interquartile range, 0.5-2.5). Among these providers, total mean duration of abnormal ventilation was 57 seconds (95% confidence interval, 41-72) or 47% (95% confidence interval, 34%-60%) of the 2-minute period. CONCLUSIONS Normal ventilation is difficult to maintain among providers delivering BVM ventilation to pediatric patients without objective feedback. Incorporation of capnography monitoring may improve BVM ventilation in children.","Becker, Heather J; Langhan, Melissa L",Pediatric emergency care,188,1

METHODS We analyzed data from the Get With The Guidelines-Stroke national quality improvement registry from January 2009 to April 2013. Frequency, determinants, and outcomes of tPA use were compared among patients aged ≥90 and 3 younger age groups (18-64, 65-79, and 80-89 years). RESULTS Among 35 708 patients from 1178 sites who arrived within 2 hours of time last known well and received tPA, 2585 (7.2%) were ≥90 years. Compared with younger patients, the rate of tPA use among patients without a documented contraindication was lower among patients aged ≥90 years (67.4% versus 84.1% in 18-89-year olds; P<0.0001). Discharge outcomes among individuals aged ≥90 years included discharge to home or acute rehabilitation in 31.4%, independent ambulation at discharge in 13.4%, symptomatic hemorrhage in 6.1%, and in-hospital mortality or hospice discharge in 36.4%. On multivariable analysis, good functional outcomes generally occurred less often and mortality more often among patients aged ≥90 years. The risk of symptomatic hemorrhage was increased compared with patients <65 years but was not significantly different than the risk in 66- to 89-year olds. CONCLUSIONS The use of intravenous tPA among those aged ≥90 years is lower than in younger patients. When fibrinolytic therapy is used, the risk of symptomatic hemorrhage is not higher than in 66- to 89-year olds; however, mortality is higher and functional outcomes are lower.","Arora, Rohan; Salamon, Elliott; Katz, Jeffrey M; Cox, Margueritte; Saver, Jeffrey L; Bhatt, Deepak L; Fonarow, Gregg C; Peterson, Eric D; Smith, Eric E; Schwamm, Lee H; Xian, Ying; Libman, Richard B",Stroke,188,12

With the introduction of external female urinary catheters, we can now substitute this type of device for an indwelling urinary catheter in many patients, decreasing their risk of catheter associated urinary tract infections (CAUTI). METHODS In this retrospective study, we analyzed the impact of a hospital-wide implementation of an external female urinary catheter at a large academic medical center. The study included female patients, greater than 18 years of age. We compared a 12-month period before and after device implementation to assess the impact on indwelling urinary catheter utilization and CAUTI rate. RESULTS Data included over 220,000 patient days, over 10,000 external urinary catheter days and 33,000 indwelling urinary catheter days. We found a statistically significant decrease in indwelling urinary catheter utilization following the implementation of the external female urinary catheter, but only in intensive care units. CONCLUSION It is our recommendation that facilities first implement the device in ICUs as this level of care was where we observed the most significant impact.","Warren, Curtis; Fosnacht, Jaclyn D; Tremblay, Elizabeth E",American journal of infection control,188,1

ACE2 has been proposed as an interferon-stimulated gene (ISG). Thus, interferon-induced variability in ACE2 expression levels could be important for susceptibility to COVID-19 or its outcomes. Here, we report the discovery of a novel, transcriptionally independent truncated isoform of ACE2, which we designate as deltaACE2 (dACE2). We demonstrate that dACE2, but not ACE2, is an ISG. In The Cancer Genome Atlas, the expression of dACE2 was enriched in squamous tumors of the respiratory, gastrointestinal and urogenital tracts. In vitro, dACE2, which lacks 356 amino-terminal amino acids, was non-functional in binding the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and as a carboxypeptidase. Our results suggest that the ISG-type induction of dACE2 in IFN-high conditions created by treatments, an inflammatory tumor microenvironment or viral co-infections is unlikely to increase the cellular entry of SARS-CoV-2 and promote infection.","Onabajo, Olusegun O; Banday, A Rouf; Stanifer, Megan L; Yan, Wusheng; Obajemu, Adeola; Santer, Deanna M; Florez-Vargas, Oscar; Piontkivska, Helen; Vargas, Joselin M; Ring, Timothy J; Kee, Carmon; Doldan, Patricio; Tyrrell, D Lorne; Mendoza, Juan L; Boulant, Steeve; Prokunina-Olsson, Ludmila",Nature genetics,188,11

However, a- and presymptomatic patients remain undetected although the viral load may be high. METHODS In this retrospective cohort study, all hospitalized patients who received PCR admission testing from 26th March until 24th May 2020 were included. Data on COVID-19 specific symptoms and contact history to COVID-19 cases were retrospectively extracted from patient files and from contact tracing notes. RESULTS The compliance to the universal testing protocol was high with 90%. Out of 6,940 tested patients 27 new SARS-CoV-2 infections (0.4%) were detected. 7 of those COVID-19 cases (26% of all new cases) were asymptomatic and had no positive contact history, but were identified through a positive PCR test. The number needed to identify an asymptomatic patient was 425 in the first wave of the epidemic, 1218 in the low incidence phase. Specificity of the method was above 99.9%. CONCLUSIONS Universal PCR testing was highly accepted by staff as demonstrated by a high compliance.

Design Systematic review and meta-analysis. Data sources Medline via Pubmed, Embase via OVID, CINAHL via Ebsco, SportDiscus up until 24 November 2017 were searched. Eligibility criteria for selecting studies Inclusion criteria were (1) controlled or randomised controlled clinical trials (RCTs), (2) participants with diagnosis of patellar tendon related disorder, (3) participants≤18 years of age at enrolment and (4) published in a peer-reviewed English or Scandinavian language journal. Results Of 530 studies identified, eight were included after screening, with three included in data synthesis. To be included in data synthesis, we required studies to have included (and have data available for) a minimum of 10 participants under 18 years. All studies were rated as being at high risk of bias. For adolescents with patellar tendinopathy, one RCT compared eccentric exercises to usual care and found no difference between groups. In adolescents with Osgood-Schlatter disease (OSD), injection of local anaesthetic with dextrose proved superior to either usual care or local anaesthetic alone (three armed RCTs). In a retrospective case controlled study in adolescents with OSD, surgery provided no benefit over conservative management in terms of persistent symptoms and had a higher complication rate. Conclusion There is weak evidence to support the use of dextrose injection with local anaesthetic and no evidence to support the use of specific types of exercises to treat children/adolescents with OSD/patellar tendinopathy. Until further evidence arises, clinicians should include load modification and advise on a return to sport based on symptoms.","Cairns, George; Owen, Timothy; Kluzek, Stefan; Thurley, Neal; Holden, Sinead; Rathleff, Michael Skovdal; Dean, Benjamin John Floyd",BMJ open sport & exercise medicine,188,1

This review summarizes current knowledge and new discoveries about human milk and mucosal immunity. RECENT FINDINGS New data suggest that certain microbes in maternal milk may seed and shape the infant gut microbiota, which play a key role in regulating gut barrier integrity and training the developing immune system. Human milk oligosaccharides, best known for their prebiotic functions, have now been shown to directly modulate gene expression in mast and goblet cells in the gastrointestinal tract. Epidemiologic data show a reduced risk of peanut sensitization among infants breastfed by peanut-consuming mothers, suggesting a role for milk-borne food antigens in tolerance development. Cross-fostering experiments in mice suggest the soluble Toll-like receptor 2, found in human milk, may be critical in this process. Finally, interest in human milk antibodies surged during the pandemic with the identification of neutralizing severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 antibodies in maternal milk following both natural infection and vaccination. SUMMARY Human milk provides critical immune protection and stimulation to breastfed infants.

However, these methods may affect the patient's respiratory response and delay recovery from anesthesia. We aimed to evaluate the effects of fentanyl and remifentanil during extubation after video-assisted thoracic surgery (VATS). Methods This study included 45 randomly-selected male patients who underwent VATS for pneumothorax between July 2011 and August 2012. We divided the participants into 3 groups: the F group, which received a bolus injection of 1.0 μg/kg of fentanyl; the R1 group, which received a 0.04 μg/kg/min remifentanil infusion; and the R2 group, which received a 0.08 μg/kg/min remifentanil infusion. Hemodynamics, pain, cough, consciousness level, and nausea were assessed for each group. Results The number and severity of coughs were lower in the R1 and R2 groups than in the F group, and there were no differences between the R1 and R2 groups. Respiratory depression and loss of consciousness were not observed in any of the patients, and there were no differences in hemodynamics. Conclusion In comparison with fentanyl, remifentanil did not result in a wide fluctuation of blood pressure and heart rate upon emergence from general anesthesia. Moreover, remifentanil contributed to cough suppression and postoperative pain control. Remifentanil seems to be a safe and effective analgesic after VATS.","Son, Hee Won; Lee, Ji Min; Park, Se Hun; Lee, Yong Jic; Oh, Ji Mi; Hwang, Su Kyung",Journal of chest surgery,188,19

The presumed low diagnostic sensitivity of upper respiratory specimens for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) makes it difficult to confirm infection and recommend de-isolation. METHODS We retrospectively reviewed real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test results of mild or asymptomatic COVID-19 patients who were admitted at the Daegu-Gyeongbuk 7th community treatment centre in Korea between 9 March 2020 and 10 April 2020. Patients underwent an upper respiratory RT-PCR test every week until discharge. From the RT-PCR results, we evaluated the rate of prolonged (>3 weeks) SARS-CoV-2 RNA positivity. We analysed the proportion of reversed results, defined as a positive or indeterminate result one day after a negative RT-PCR result, according to time (<14, 15-21, 22-28, >28 days) from the initial positive RT-PCR result. RESULTS In 23% (69/300) of patients, SARS-CoV-2 was detected more than 3 weeks after the initial positive RT-PCR. In 14% (42/300) of patients, the RT-PCR results were positive for more than 4 weeks. For 37.5% (152/405) of negative RT-PCR results, the results were reversed in the next day's test. And 43.5% (123/283) of negative RT-PCR results were reversed within 3 weeks of diagnosis.

Our objective was to determine the clinical and radiologic predictors of TFFC in patients undergoing AWR. STUDY DESIGN We conducted a single institution retrospective cohort study of adults who underwent AWR between 2007 and 2018. Demographics, hernia characteristics and operative data were collected. Linear and volumetric variables were obtained from preoperative abdominal CT scans, the latter following 3D reconstruction. Logistic regression was used to evaluate predictors of TFFC. Area under the curve (AUC) ≥ 0.70 was considered to have acceptable discrimination. RESULTS A total of 108 patients were eligible for analysis. The mean age was 57 ± 11 years and 53 (49%) were female. 42 (39%) hernias were recurrent, 10 (9%) patients had a stoma and 9 (8%) had a history of open abdomen. The mean defect width was 11 ± 4 cm and mean defect surface area was 150 ± 95 cm2. The most common AWR technique was endoscopic component separation 75 (69%). TFFC was achieved in 90 (83%) patients. No demographics or 3D volumetric measures were predictive of TFFC (all AUC < 0.7). European hernia society (EHS) class M1 was predictive of failure of TFFC [AUC = 0.70; odds ratio 7.0 (referent M3); 95% confidence interval, 2.1-23.8]. Linear variables of rectus muscle separation were the most predictive of TFFC (AUC 0.73-0.77). CONCLUSION In contrast to clinical characteristics, radiologic characteristics of large incisional hernias requiring AWR are predictive of TFFC. In particular, EHS class M1 and linear variables of rectus muscle separation appear to be better predictors of TFFC than volumetric measurements.","Al-Mansour, M R; Wu, J; Gagnon, G; Knee, A; Romanelli, J R; Seymour, N E",Hernia : the journal of hernias and abdominal wall surgery,188,1

INTERVENTIONS All medical scribes received a survey assessing their workflow since beginning of COVID-19 restrictions. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOMES To assess the current workflow of medical scribes since transition to virtual care. Secondary outcomes are to assess the equipment used and location of their new workflow. RESULTS Fifty-seven scribes completed the survey. Overall 42% of scribes have transitioned to remote scribing with 97% serving as remote scribes for remote visits. This workflow is conducted at home and with personal equipment. Of those not working as scribes, 46% serve in preclinic support, with a wide range of EHR-related activities being reported. The remaining scribes have been either redeployed or furloughed. CONCLUSION The rapid transition to virtual care brought about by COVID-19 has resulted in a dramatic shift in scribe workflow with the adoption of a previously unreported workflow of remote scribing for virtual care. Additional work is now needed to ensure these new workflows are safe and effective and that scribes are trained to work in this new paradigm.","Gold, Jeffrey A; Becton, James; Ash, Joan S; Corby, Sky; Mohan, Vishnu",Applied clinical informatics,188,17

The most prominent membranous structures present in HCV-infected cells are double-membrane vesicles (DMVs). However, their composition and role in the HCV replication cycle are poorly understood. To gain further insights into the biochemcial properties of HCV-induced membrane alterations, we generated a functional replicon containing a hemagglutinin (HA) affinity tag in nonstructural protein 4B (NS4B), the supposed scaffold protein of the viral replication complex. By using HA-specific affinity purification we isolated NS4B-containing membranes from stable replicon cells. Complementing biochemical and electron microscopy analyses of purified membranes revealed predominantly DMVs, which contained viral proteins NS3 and NS5A as well as enzymatically active viral replicase capable of de novo synthesis of HCV RNA. In addition to viral factors, co-opted cellular proteins, such as vesicle-associated membrane protein-associated protein A (VAP-A) and VAP-B, that are crucial for viral RNA replication, as well as cholesterol, a major structural lipid of detergent-resistant membranes, are highly enriched in DMVs. Here we describe the first isolation and biochemical characterization of HCV-induced DMVs. The results obtained underline their central role in the HCV replication cycle and suggest that DMVs are sites of viral RNA replication. The experimental approach described here is a powerful tool to more precisely define the molecular composition of membranous replication factories induced by other positive-strand RNA viruses, such as picorna-, arteri- and coronaviruses.","Paul, David; Hoppe, Simone; Saher, Gesine; Krijnse-Locker, Jacomine; Bartenschlager, Ralf",Journal of virology,188,17

LESS surgery offers faster recovery, less postoperative pain and optimal cosmetic results. The reusable nature of its instruments also has significant economic advantages. PATIENT AND METHOD We present a 34-year-old patient with a solid mesorenal lesion measuring 8 cm in the left kidney treated with pure LESS radical nephrectomy assisted by vaginal extraction of the specimen. The umbilical approach using a single-site multichannel KeyPort (Richard Wolf GmbH, Knittlingen, Germany) with DuoRotate curved instruments allows for minimum crushing and fewer spatial conflicts. Its perfect umbilical adaptation provides a hermetic system. The instrument's double rotation provides considerable movement precision. Vaginal extraction avoids damage to the abdominal wall and the need for widening the umbilical incision. RESULTS After the placement of the device and triangulation of the clips, we proceeded to operate on posterior parietal peritoneum. The descending colon was mobilized to access the retroperitoneum and dissect the renal hilum. Hem-o-lok clips were placed on the artery and vein, which were subsequently sectioned. The specimen was inserted into a laparoscopic bag. Under direct vision, we placed a 15-mm trocar through the bottom of the vaginal posterior fornix to facilitate the extraction of the bag's thread. The incision was widened with the fingers, and the specimen was extracted, closing the vagina from the perineum with visualization from the navel. Abdominal drainage was not employed. The surgical time was 180 min. The patient was discharged the following day without needing analgesia. A year later, the patient was disease-free and had no complications. CONCLUSIONS Umbilical LESS radical nephrectomy with vaginal extraction is feasible in selected cases. The procedure is oncologically safe, avoids scars and facilitates early recovery. From a practical point of view, this approach greatly simplifies natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery (NOTES) and enables a minimally invasive equivalent result.","Andrés, G; García-Mediero, J M; García-Tello, A; Arance, I; Cabrera, P M; Angulo, J C",Actas urologicas espanolas,188,20

Prior literature has described physician weight bias toward patients, but little research has investigated inter-physician weight bias. This study describes the prevalence of inter-physician implicit weight bias, and investigates the relationships between implicit, explicit, and professional biases. The authors hypothesized that the majority of physicians possess inter-physician implicit weight bias, and that the degree of implicit bias has a direct relationship with explicit and professional weight bias. METHODS In this cross-sectional study, a survey was used to measure inter-physician implicit, explicit, and professional weight bias. It included adaptations of two previously validated measures (the Implicit Association Test and the Crandall Anti-fat Attitudes Questionnaire) and an investigator developed and tested Professional Weight Bias Scale. The survey was distributed electronically via medical society message boards, email lists, and social media groups. RESULTS 620 physicians and medical students participated. 58% were female, ages ranged from 22 to 83 years (mean 44 years), and body mass index ranged from 16 to 59 (mean 26). Descriptive analyses revealed 87% had some degree of implicit inter-physician anti-fat bias, with 31% and 34% categorized as moderate and severe, respectively. Correlation and multiple regression analyses revealed that male sex, increased age, and decrease body mass index were related to increased implicit bias, controlling for all other factors. Furthermore, implicit, explicit, and professional bias all had significant, direct relationships with each other. CONCLUSIONS Our findings highlight the prevalence of inter-physician implicit weight bias; the strong correlations between implicit, explicit, and professional weight bias; and the potential disparities faced by physicians with obesity. These results may be used to guide implicit bias training for a more inclusive medical workplace.","McLean, Mary E; McLean, Leigh E; McLean-Holden, Annie C; Campbell, Linelle F; Horner, Adriana M; Kulkarni, Miriam L; Melville, Laura; Fernandez, Elizabeth A",Academic emergency medicine : official journal of the Society for Academic Emergency Medicine,188,8

Loneliness and social isolation are consistently identified as risk factors for poor mental and physical health in older people. Video calls may help older people stay connected during the current crisis by widening the participant's social circle or by increasing the frequency of contact with existing acquaintances. OBJECTIVES The primary objective of this rapid review is to assess the effectiveness of video calls for reducing social isolation and loneliness in older adults. The review also sought to address the effectiveness of video calls on reducing symptoms of depression and improving quality of life. SEARCH METHODS We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, PsycINFO and CINAHL from 1 January 2004 to 7 April 2020. We also searched the references of relevant systematic reviews. SELECTION CRITERIA Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs (including cluster designs) were eligible for inclusion. We excluded all other study designs. The samples in included studies needed to have a mean age of at least 65 years. We included studies that included participants whether or not they were experiencing symptoms of loneliness or social isolation at baseline. Any intervention in which a core component involved the use of the internet to facilitate video calls or video conferencing through computers, smartphones or tablets with the intention of reducing loneliness or social isolation, or both, in older adults was eligible for inclusion. We included studies in the review if they reported self-report measures of loneliness, social isolation, symptoms of depression or quality of life. Two review authors screened 25% of abstracts; a third review author resolved conflicts. A single review author screened the remaining abstracts. The second review author screened all excluded abstracts and we resolved conflicts by consensus or by involving a third review author. We followed the same process for full-text articles. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS One review author extracted data, which another review author checked. The primary outcomes were loneliness and social isolation and the secondary outcomes were symptoms of depression and quality of life. One review author rated the certainty of evidence for the primary outcomes according to the GRADE approach and another review author checked the ratings. We conducted fixed-effect meta-analyses for the primary outcome, loneliness, and the secondary outcome, symptoms of depression. MAIN RESULTS We identified three cluster quasi-randomised trials, which together included 201 participants. The included studies compared video call interventions to usual care in nursing homes. None of these studies were conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic. Each study measured loneliness using the UCLA Loneliness Scale. Total scores range from 20 (least lonely) to 80 (most lonely). The evidence was very uncertain and suggests that video calls may result in little to no difference in scores on the UCLA Loneliness Scale compared to usual care at three months (mean difference (MD) -0.44, 95% confidence interval (CI) -3.28 to 2.41; 3 studies; 201 participants), at six months (MD -0.34, 95% CI -3.41 to 2.72; 2 studies; 152 participants) and at 12 months (MD -2.40, 95% CI -7.20 to 2.40; 1 study; 90 participants). We downgraded the certainty of this evidence by three levels for study limitations, imprecision and indirectness. None of the included studies reported social isolation as an outcome. Each study measured symptoms of depression using the Geriatric Depression Scale. Total scores range from 0 (better) to 30 (worse). The evidence was very uncertain and suggests that video calls may result in little to no difference in scores on the Geriatric Depression Scale compared to usual care at three months' follow-up (MD 0.41, 95% CI -0.90 to 1.72; 3 studies; 201 participants) or six months' follow-up (MD -0.83, 95% CI -2.43 to 0.76; 2 studies, 152 participants). The evidence suggests that video calls may have a small effect on symptoms of depression at one-year follow-up, though this finding is imprecise (MD -2.04, 95% CI -3.98 to -0.10; 1 study; 90 participants). We downgraded the certainty of this evidence by three levels for study limitations, imprecision and indirectness. Only one study, with 62 participants, reported quality of life. The study measured quality of life using a Taiwanese adaptation of the Short-Form 36-question health survey (SF-36), which consists of eight subscales that measure different aspects of quality of life: physical function; physical role; emotional role; social function; pain: vitality; mental health; and physical health. Each subscale is scored from 0 (poor health) to 100 (good health). The evidence is very uncertain and suggests that there may be little to no difference between people allocated to usual care and those allocated to video calls in three-month scores in physical function (MD 2.88, 95% CI -5.01 to 10.77), physical role (MD -7.66, 95% CI -24.08 to 8.76), emotional role (MD -7.18, 95% CI -16.23 to 1.87), social function (MD 2.77, 95% CI -8.87 to 14.41), pain scores (MD -3.25, 95% CI -15.11 to 8.61), vitality scores (MD -3.60, 95% CI -9.01 to 1.81), mental health (MD 9.19, 95% CI 0.36 to 18.02) and physical health (MD 5.16, 95% CI -2.48 to 12.80). We downgraded the certainty of this evidence by three levels for study limitations, imprecision and indirectness. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS Based on this review there is currently very uncertain evidence on the effectiveness of video call interventions to reduce loneliness in older adults. The review did not include any studies that reported evidence of the effectiveness of video call interventions to address social isolation in older adults. The evidence regarding the effectiveness of video calls for outcomes of symptoms of depression was very uncertain. Future research in this area needs to use more rigorous methods and more diverse and representative participants. Specifically, future studies should target older adults, who are demonstrably lonely or socially isolated, or both, across a range of settings to determine whether video call interventions are effective in a population in which these outcomes are in need of improvement.","Noone, Chris; McSharry, Jenny; Smalle, Mike; Burns, Annette; Dwan, Kerry; Devane, Declan; Morrissey, Eimear C",The Cochrane database of systematic reviews,188,0

The theme of his accumulated work was advancing child development as social action for children and families. Besides early childhood intervention and policy, for which he devoted most of his time, Dr. Zigler did pioneering work in education and school reform, social policy, prevention, child maltreatment, family support, developmental disabilities, and in service to government. In this article, I reflect on four of Dr. Zigler's major contributions to science and society that are underrated and, in many respects, under-appreciated in the larger context of the field. These are (a) historical analysis of Head Start, (b) conceptualization and analysis of motivation as a key component of early childhood program impacts, (c) development of preschool-to-third-grade programs and school reforms, and (d) critical analysis of theory, research, policy, and practice. Together, these and other contributions by Dr. Zigler provide a strong foundation to build a better society for all.","Reynolds, Arthur J",Development and psychopathology,188,9

Dystocia occurred in two dams each, with malposition of a singleton fetus. Both dams were successfully treated with surgical intervention by caesarian section. Of the two individuals, one fetus was nonviable, but the other neonate survived and was reared by the dam to weaning. A third pregnant female died during pregnancy from septicemia resulting in death of the preterm fetus. The two additional dams of the five gave birth to full-term neonates. One fetus was stillborn with evidence of fetal distress, and the other died immediately after birth (perinatal death) with undetermined etiology. Based on this case series, complications associated with pregnancy occur in P. tricuspis, indicating the need for further study and close monitoring during impending parturition.","Aitken-Palmer, Copper; deMaar, Thomas W; Johnson, James G; Langan, Jennifer; Bergmann, Jonathan; Chinnadurai, Sathya; Guerra, Hector; Carboni, Deborah A; Adkesson, Michael J",Journal of zoo and wildlife medicine : official publication of the American Association of Zoo Veterinarians,188,1

Since this if the first-year interviews were held entirely virtual for a (NRMP) match season, we sought to determine: (1) How did program directors (PDs) in this year's fellowship conduct their virtual interviews? (2) Were any of these conduct decisions associated with the PD satisfaction with the resulting match? (3) What is the PDs opinion of how interviews should occur next year if COVID-19 is not a factor? DESIGN AND SETTING The authors sent an anonymous survey to the PDs of all programs participating in the 2021 colon and rectal surgery residency match directly following match day 2020. PARTICIPANTS Forty-one colon and rectal residency PDs (70% response rate) responded to the survey (78% Male) representing a range of experience (M = 7.61, SD = 5.66, years as PD at current institution), and program type (77.5% Academic, 7.5% Independent Academic Medical Center, 15% Nonacademic). RESULTS While programs utilized several different platforms, conducted various forms of training for their faculty, and provided applicants with different types of information, interview day(s) across the specialty are reported to have proceeded smoothly. PDs as a whole were very satisfied with their match results this year (M = 4.65, SD = .66), and this satisfaction was not impacted by virtual interview decisions or processes. However, only 55% of PDs agree or strongly agree that next year's interviews should be virtual regardless of COVID-19, a judgement solely influenced by the opinion of other program faculty on virtual interviews, regardless of satisfaction with match or comfort with technology. CONCLUSION While PDs report high satisfaction with virtual interview processes and outcomes, there is less agreement that colon and rectal surgery residency interviews should move to a solely virtual platform.","D'Angelo, Jonathan D; D'Angelo, Anne-Lise D; Mathis, Kellie L; Dozois, Eric J; Kelley, Scott R",Journal of surgical education,188,12

We determine the structure of the yeast histone H3-H4 complex based on ~500,000 genetic interactions of 350 mutants. We then apply the method to subunits Rpb1-Rpb2 of yeast RNA polymerase II and subunits RpoB-RpoC of bacterial RNA polymerase. The accuracy is comparable to that based on chemical cross-links; using restraints from both genetic interactions and cross-links further improves model accuracy and precision.

Their efficacy has been questioned by several recent studies. We therefore studied the results of all of our patients who received a biological prosthesis, including hernia recurrence and infectious complications. PATIENTS AND METHODS We retrospectively reviewed the outcomes of 68 patients who underwent biological prosthesis placement from 2009 to 2015 in a single center. RESULTS The site of implantation was on the anterior abdominal wall in 49 (72%) of cases, in the pelvis in 19 (28%). The median follow-up was 19 months. In the early post-operative period, 22 (32.3%) of patients presented with wall abscess; eight (11.7%) underwent surgical revision and seven (10.2%) underwent interventional radiological drainage. In the medium term, 41/56 (73%) had a late complication; 32 (57%) of the patients developed recurrent herniation and 15 (26.7%) of them were re-operated. In addition, nine (16%) of patients developed a late surgical site infection and eight (14.2%) a chronic residual infection. In multivariate analysis, the risk factors for recurrence were parastomal hernia (P=0.007) and a history of recurrent hernia (P=0.002). CONCLUSION A majority of patients developed recurrent incisional herniation in the medium term. This puts the use of biological prostheses into question. These results need to be compared to those of semi-absorbable prostheses.","Brinas, P; Chalret du Rieu, M; Tuyeras, G; Julio, C H; Kirzin, S; Ghouti, L; Carrere, N",Journal of visceral surgery,188,1

We evaluated rapid endovascular treatment in addition to standard care in patients with acute ischemic stroke with a small infarct core, a proximal intracranial arterial occlusion, and moderate-to-good collateral circulation. METHODS We randomly assigned participants to receive standard care (control group) or standard care plus endovascular treatment with the use of available thrombectomy devices (intervention group). Patients with a proximal intracranial occlusion in the anterior circulation were included up to 12 hours after symptom onset. Patients with a large infarct core or poor collateral circulation on computed tomography (CT) and CT angiography were excluded. Workflow times were measured against predetermined targets. The primary outcome was the score on the modified Rankin scale (range, 0 [no symptoms] to 6 [death]) at 90 days. A proportional odds model was used to calculate the common odds ratio as a measure of the likelihood that the intervention would lead to lower scores on the modified Rankin scale than would control care (shift analysis). RESULTS The trial was stopped early because of efficacy. At 22 centers worldwide, 316 participants were enrolled, of whom 238 received intravenous alteplase (120 in the intervention group and 118 in the control group). In the intervention group, the median time from study CT of the head to first reperfusion was 84 minutes. The rate of functional independence (90-day modified Rankin score of 0 to 2) was increased with the intervention (53.0%, vs. 29.3% in the control group; P<0.001). The primary outcome favored the intervention (common odds ratio, 2.6; 95% confidence interval, 1.7 to 3.8; P<0.001), and the intervention was associated with reduced mortality (10.4%, vs. 19.0% in the control group; P=0.04).

Our aim is to investigate the incidence of complicated acute appendicitis (AA; peritonitis or appendicular mass) during confinement for COVID-19 pandemic and to compare it with the previous 5 years. MATERIALS AND METHODS A retrospective study was performed in children with AA who underwent surgery between March 9 and April 13 from 2015 to 2020; patients were divided into six groups according to the year of surgery. We analyzed demographic variables, time from onset of symptoms, mean hospital stay, cumulative incidence, and incidence rate of complicated appendicitis. RESULTS A total of 168 patients were included with no differences in the number of patients, gender, and age between groups. Patients in 2020 (COVID-19 group) presented longer symptom progression time (46.8 hours; p = 0.046), higher rate of complicated appendicitis (48.4%; p = 0.004), longer mean hospital stay (4.9 days; p < 0.001), increased cumulative incidence (8.27 cases per 100,000 children per 0.1 years; p < 0.001), and increased incidence rate of complicated appendicitis (83 cases per 100,000 children; p < 0.001) when compared with other groups.

The nucleocapsid (N) proteins of CoVs are predominantly localized in the cytoplasm where the viruses replicate, but in some cases the proteins are partially located in the nucleolus. Many studies have investigated the subcellular localization and nucleocytoplasmic trafficking signals of the CoV N-proteins, but little is known about ToV N-proteins. Here, we studied the subcellular localization of the bovine ToV (BToV) N-protein (BToN) and characterized its nucleocytoplasmic trafficking signals. Unlike other CoVs, BToN in infected cells was transported mainly to the nucleolus during early infection but distributed predominantly in the nucleoplasm rather than in the nucleolus during late infection. Interestingly, a small quantity of BToN was detected in the cytoplasm during infection. Examination of a comprehensive set of substitution or deletion mutants of BToN fused with EGFP revealed that clusters of arginine (R) residues comprise nuclear/nucleolar localization signals (NLS/NoLS), and the C-terminal region served as a chromosomal maintenance 1 (CRM1)-independent nuclear export signal (NES). Moreover, recombinant viruses with mutations in the NLS/NoLS, but retaining nuclear accumulation, were successfully rescued and showed slightly reduced growth ability, while the virus that lost the NLS/NoLS-mediated nuclear accumulation of BToN was not rescued. These results indicate that BToN uniquely accumulates mainly in nuclear compartments during infection, regulated by an R-rich NLS/NoLS and a CRM1-independent NES, and that the BToN-accumulation in the nuclear compartment driven by NLS/NoLS is important for virus growth.IMPORTANCE ToVs are diarrhea-causing pathogens detected in many species, including humans. BToV has spread worldwide, leading to economic loss, and there is currently no treatment or vaccine available. Positive-stranded RNA viruses, including ToVs, replicate in the cytoplasm, and their structural proteins generally accumulate in the cytoplasm. Interestingly, BToN predominantly accumulated in the nucleus/nucleolus during all infectious processes, with only a small fraction accumulating in the cytoplasm despite being a major structural protein. Furthermore, we identified unique nucleocytoplasmic trafficking signals and demonstrated the importance of NLS/NoLS for virus growth. This study is the first to undertake an in-depth investigation of the subcellular localization and intracellular trafficking signals of BToN. Our findings additionally suggest that the NLS/NoLS-mediated nuclear accumulation of BToN is important for virus replication. Understanding its unique features, BToV may provide novel insights into the assembly mechanisms of not only ToVs but also other positive-stranded RNA viruses.","Ujike, Makoto; Kawachi, Yukako; Matsunaga, Yui; Etho, Yuka; Asanuma, Hideki; Kamitani, Wataru; Taguchi, Fumihiro",Journal of virology,188,19

Since December 2007 we have performed esophagojejunostomy after totally laparoscopic total gastrectomy (TLTG) in more than 110 cases in our institution by using a circular stapler with a trans-orally inserted anvil. We performed a single-center comparative study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of esophagojejunostomy using a trans-orally inserted anvil in patients who underwent TLTG for the treatment of gastric cancer. METHODS In the present study, we examined 329 patients with gastric cancer who underwent esophagojejunostomy using a circular stapler after total gastrectomy. Data on the clinicopathological features, operative time, amount of intraoperative blood loss, and incidence of anastomosis-related complications among the surgical groups were obtained by reviewing the medical records, which were then analyzed. RESULTS Approximately 67% of the patients were men, and the average patient age was 64.0 years (range 26-93 years). In addition, 166 (50.5%) and 163 (49.5%) patients underwent open and laparoscopic surgery, respectively. Leakage following esophagojejunostomy was noted in 7 (4.2%) of 166 patients who underwent total gastrectomy with open laparotomy, and 0 of 46 patients who underwent laparoscopic-assisted total gastrectomy (LATG). However, only 2 (1.7%) of 117 patients who underwent TLTG using a trans-orally inserted anvil exhibited leakage following esophagojejunostomy. Anastomotic stenosis of the esophagojejunostomy was observed in 5 (3.0%) of 166 patients who underwent total gastrectomy with open laparotomy, 2 (4.3%) of 46 patients who underwent LATG, and 2 (1.7%) of 117 patients who underwent TLTG using a trans-orally inserted anvil. CONCLUSIONS We believe that esophagojejunostomy using a trans-orally inserted anvil after TLTG for gastric cancer is a safe and useful surgical procedure.","Ito, Hiroaki; Inoue, Haruhiro; Odaka, Noriko; Satodate, Hitoshi; Onimaru, Manabu; Ikeda, Haruo; Takayanagi, Daisuke; Nakahara, Kenta; Kudo, Shin-ei",Surgical endoscopy,188,17

A cure can only be achieved by removing all diseased glands. It is critical to localize the hyperfunctioning glands exactly to prevent extensive surgical exploration. The number of false negative/inconclusive results in standard imaging techniques is high. We aimed to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of 18F-Fluorocholine-PET in combination with contrast-enhanced CT (FCH-PET/CT) and its sensitivity in patients with primary, secondary/tertiary, and familial HPT with negative and/or discordant findings in ultrasound and/or 99mTc-sestamibi scintigraphy/SPECT/CT. METHODS A total of 96 patients with HPT and negative/equivocal conventional imaging were referred for FCH-PET/CT. In this retrospective, single institution study, 69 patients, who have undergone surgery and histopathologic workup, were analyzed. Of the 69 patients included, 60 patients suffered from primary HPT, four from secondary or tertiary HPT, and five from familial HPT. Sensitivities, positive predictive values, and accuracies were calculated. RESULTS Sensitivity/positive predictive value (PPV) per lesion was 87.5/98.3% for primary HPT, 75/100% for secondary/tertiary HPT and 25/66.7% for familial HPT. Sensitivity/PPV per patient was 91.5/98.2% for primary HPT, 100/100% for secondary/tertiary HPT and 50/100% for familial HPT. All patients showed normalized serum calcium levels in the postoperative period. The follow-up rate was 97%. Of the patients included in the study, 58 of 60 patients with primary HPT, and four of four patients with secondary/tertiary HPT showed normal calcium and parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels after six months and were cured. Of the patients with familial HPT, four of five patients were cured. CONCLUSION Diagnostic accuracy of 18F-Fluorocholine-PET/CT for patients with pHPT is excellent. 18F-Fluorocholine-PET/CT is a valuable tool for endocrine surgeons to optimize the surgical treatment of patients with hyperparathyroidism.","Gass, Jörn-Markus; Wicke, Corinna; Mona, Caroline; Strobel, Klaus; Müller, Werner; Metzger, Jürg; Suter-Widmer, Isabelle; Henzen, Christoph; Fischli, Stefan",Endocrine,188,16

These events involve structural rearrangements, including heteromerization between two heptad repeats (HR1 and HR2) to form a trimer of dimers as a six-helix bundle (6-HB), a quaternary protein structure that brings two distant clusters of hydrophobic sequences into the proximity of each other, the internal fusion peptide (IFP) preceding HR1, and the highly conserved tryptophan (Trp)-rich membrane proximal external region (MPER) following HR2. Here, we show that MPER can undergo self-oligomerization and heteromerization with IFP, events that are Trp-dependent. To delineate the roles of Trp residues of MPER in forming these quaternary structures and interacting with membranes, we employed a panel of synthetic peptides: MPER peptide (M-wt) and its alanine (Ala) and phenylalanine (Phe) analogues. Ala substitutions of Trp inhibited its association with cellular membranes. Chemical cross-linking experiments showed that M-wt can self-interact to form oligomers and cross-interact with IFP23, a synthetic IFP peptide, to form a heterohexamer. In comparison, little high-order oligomer was formed between M-wt and fusion peptide. The specific interaction between M-wt and IFP23 was confirmed by immunofluorescence staining experiments. In aqueous solutions, both M-wt and IFP23 displayed random secondary structures that became helical in hydrophobic solvents. Triple-Ala substitutions of Trp in M-wt, but not the corresponding triple-Phe analogue, disrupted oligomerization of M-wt and hetero-oligomerization of M-wt with IFP23. Overall, our results show that Trp residues of MPER play a key role in maintaining the structure and functions of MPER, allowing it to interact with IFP to form a MPER-IFP heteromer, a putative quaternary structure extending from the 6-HB, and function in membrane fusion. Finally, we showed that a MPER peptide could serve as an inhibitor in the entry process.","Liao, Ying; Zhang, Si Min; Neo, Tuan Ling; Tam, James P",Biochemistry,188,1

As such, we designed this randomized trial to elucidate the contributions of biomechanical and neurophysiological processes. A total of 132 participants with low back pain were randomly assigned to receive SMT at either the lumbar segment measured as the stiffest or the segment measured as having the lowest pain threshold. The primary outcome was patient reported low back pain intensity following treatment. Secondary outcomes were biomechanical stiffness and neurophysiological pressure pain threshold. All outcomes were measured at baseline, after the fourth and final session and at 2-weeks follow-up. Data were analyzed using linear mixed models, and demonstrated that the SMT application site did not influence patient reported low back pain intensity or stiffness. However, a large and significant difference in pressure pain threshold was observed between groups. This study provides support that SMT impacts neurophysiological parameters through a segment-dependent neurological reflex pathway, although this do not seem to be a proxy for improvement.

Often these nurses are unaware of Martin Heidegger's role in the German National Socialist Party of the 1930s and his allegiance to fascist ideology. We ask: can a bad person have good ideas? In line with pragmatic thinkers such as Richard Rorty, we argue that instead of value judgements on people and their ideas, nurses should consider ideas as a product of a historical/social and political time and space. In urging a critical political engagement, we argue for a Husserlian approach. In opposition to Heidegger's interpretivist phenomenology approach, in which the hegemony of the day is integral to the phenomena being studied, we propose that a more expressive, collaborative engagement using Husserlian descriptive phenomenology approach would serve better in encouraging a more critical engagement with how ideas are used by groups of people, how some groups might be advantaged and others disadvantaged. Our conclusion is that the separation of ideas from political and social context is dangerous, and nurses, including nurse researchers, must understand how their research ideas and methods influence and are influenced by political agendas.","Randall, Duncan C; Richardson, Andrew",Nursing inquiry,188,1

Finland is a country with extraordinary sauna culture and bathing opportunities. However, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic introduced regulations and unprecedented closures to shared sauna facilities. In this study we aimed to examine the previously unknown baseline bathing frequency and its possible change during the epidemic. DESIGN We investigated several aspects of sauna bathing with self-reports: the frequency, its possible changes, reasons for change, and beliefs about its health effects among a representative sample of thousand Finns aged 18-75 years. This online survey was administered in May 2020. RESULTS Before the pandemic, 59 % of our respondents had enjoyed sauna at least once a week. Since the pandemic began, up to 23 % had reduced or stopped their bathing. This was often due to restricted sauna access. However, 11 % of respondents bathed more frequently and attributed this change to seeking relaxation and passing time. These findings demonstrate a surprising flexibility in this health-promoting national pastime. Men were more active bathers than women overall and women under 35 enjoy sauna more seldom than older women. Only 7.9 % of all respondents bathed at least four times a week, exceeding a suggested threshold for maximum health benefits. CONCLUSIONS Finnish people are active sauna bathers. The COVID-19 pandemic demonstrated that the frequency of bathing is dependent on good access to sauna facilities. This flexibility and wide access could be exploited to improve public health in the long term if more frequent bathing became a standard.","Liikkanen, Lassi A; Laukkanen, Jari A",Complementary therapies in medicine,188,1

The pH drop that accompanies endosomal maturation, often in conjunction with proteolysis, triggers viral proteins to insert into the endosomal membrane and drive fusion. Fusion dynamics have been studied by tracking viruses within living cells, which limits the precision with which fusion can be synchronized and controlled, and reconstituting viral fusion to synthetic membranes, which introduces non-physiological membrane curvature and composition. To overcome these limitations, we report chemically controllable triggering of single-virus fusion within endosomes. We isolate influenza (A/Aichi/68; H3N2) virus:endosome conjugates from cells, immobilize them in a microfluidic flow cell, and rapidly and controllably trigger fusion. Observed lipid-mixing kinetics are surprisingly similar to influenza fusion with model membranes of opposite curvature: 80% of single-virus events have indistinguishable kinetics. This result suggests that endosomal membrane curvature is not a key permissive feature for viral entry, at least lipid mixing. The assay preserves endosomal membrane asymmetry and protein composition, providing a platform to test how cellular restriction factors and altered endosomal trafficking affect viral membrane fusion.IMPORTANCE Many enveloped viruses infect cells via fusion to endosomes, but controlling this process within living cells has been challenging. Here, we study the fusion of influenza virions to endosomes in a chemically controllable manner. Extracting virus-endosome conjugates from cells and exogenously triggering fusion permits precise study of virus-endosome fusion kinetics. Surprisingly, endosomal curvature does not grossly alter fusion kinetics, although membrane deformability does. This supports a model for influenza virus entry where cells restrict or permit membrane fusion by changing deformability, for instance using interferon-induced proteins.","Haldar, Sourav; Okamoto, Kenta; Dunning, Rebecca A; Kasson, Peter M",Journal of virology,188,12

The most common form of toxic effects of APAP is in the liver where phosphatidylcholine is the major component of the cell membrane with additional associated functionalities. Although this is the case, the effects of APAP on pure phospholipid membranes have been largely ignored. Here, we used 1,2-di-(octadecenoyl)-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DOPC), a commonly found phospholipid in mammalian cell membranes, to synthesize large unilamellar vesicles to investigate how the incorporation of APAP changes the pure lipid vesicle structure, morphology, and fluidity at different concentrations. We used a combination of dynamic light scattering, small-angle neutron and X-ray scattering (SANS, SAXS), and cryo-TEM for structural characterization, and neutron spin-echo (NSE) spectroscopy to investigate the dynamics. We showed that the incorporation of APAP in the lipid bilayer significantly impacts the spherical phospholipid self-assembly in terms of its morphology and influences the lipid content in the bilayer, causing a decrease in bending rigidity. We observe a decrease in the number of lipids per vesicle by almost 28% (0.06 wt % APAP) and 19% (0.12 wt % APAP) compared to the pure DOPC (0 wt % APAP). Our results showed that the incorporation of APAP reduces the membrane rigidity by almost 50% and changes the spherical unilamellar vesicles into much more irregularly shaped vesicles. Although the bilayer structure did not show much change when observed by SAXS, NSE and cryo-TEM results showed the lipid dynamics change with the addition of APAP in the bilayer, which causes the overall decreased membrane rigidity. A strong effect on the lipid tail motion showed that the space explored by the lipid tails increases by a factor of 1.45 (for 0.06 wt % APAP) and 1.75 (for 0.12 wt % APAP) compared to DOPC without the drug.","De Mel, Judith U; Gupta, Sudipta; Harmon, Sydney; Stingaciu, Laura; Roth, Eric W; Siebenbuerger, Miriam; Bleuel, Markus; Schneider, Gerald J",Langmuir : the ACS journal of surfaces and colloids,188,1

Structural and gendered inequities influenced women's decision to enter street-based sex work and created conditions that facilitated substance use and increased vulnerability to violence, unprotected sex and HIV transmission. Although women's agency and creative negotiation of structural forces offered possibilities for increased choices, their routine coping strategies ultimately posed as sources of risks. Women's socio-legal position constrained their choices, and this highlights how structural vulnerability is embodied as everyday survival strategies that shape exposure to harm and poor health. Findings indicate a need for policy shift towards decriminalisation of sex work and structural HIV interventions, economic empowerment measures to alleviate poverty and substance use treatment and trauma management services to improve the health and well-being of women involved in street-based sex work.","Nelson, Ediomo-Ubong Ekpo",Global public health,188,7

With the advent of biologics, reduction of recurrence after surgery has been observed in various studies. Hence, we performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to identify the rate of post-operative recurrence at different timepoints in the era of anti-TNF-α therapy biologics use. METHODS We performed a literature search using Medline and Embase databases for studies investigating biologics in preventing post-operative recurrence of Crohn's disease. Data were extracted, and a single arm meta-analysis with generalized linear mixed model and Clopper-Pearson method for confidence interval was performed to identify the endoscopic, clinical, and surgical recurrence rates at six-months, one-, two- and five-years post-operatively. RESULTS 24 articles were included in the meta-analysis. The endoscopic, clinical, and surgical postoperative recurrence rate with the use of anti-TNF-α agents at one-year was 21.72% (95%CI: 16.28% - 28.37%), 13.06% (95%CI: 8.18% - 18.92%) and 3.76% (95%CI: 1.37% - 9.91%) respectively. The five-year recurrence rate was 84.21% (95%CI: 72.35% - 91.57%) and 17.49% (95%CI: 9.17% - 30.80%) for endoscopic and surgical recurrence respectively. Subgroup analysis at one-year for type of anti-TNF-α agent or timing of initiation after surgery showed no significant difference in endoscopic, clinical and surgical recurrence rate. CONCLUSION Anti-TNF-α agents are effective at preventing clinical, endoscopic, and surgical postoperative Crohn's disease recurrence. The timing of initiating biological therapy after surgery has no significant effect on the rate of postoperative recurrence. The efficacy of infliximab and adalimumab for postoperative recurrence prevention is similar.","Jain, Sneha Rajiv; Ow, Zachariah Gene Wing; Chin, Yip Han; Lim, Wen Hui; Kong, Gwyneth; Tham, Hui Yu; Wong, Neng Wei; Chong, Choon Seng; Foo, Fung Joon; Chan, Webber Pak Wo",Journal of digestive diseases,188,1

DATA SOURCES We performed a systematic review of all English and French language full-text articles addressing surgical management of colorectal endometriosis and compared the postoperative complications according to surgical technique by meta-analysis. The PubMed, Clinical Trials.gov Cochrane Library and Web of Science databases were searched for relevant studies published before March 27, 2020. The search strategy used the following MeSH terms: (""bowel endometriosis"" or ""colorectal endometriosis"") AND (""surgery for endometriosis"" or ""conservative management"" or ""radical management"" or ""colorectal resection"" or ""shaving"" or ""full thickness resection"" or ""disc excision"") AND (""treatment"", ""outcomes"", ""long term results"" and ""complications""). METHODS OF STUDY SELECTION Two authors conducted the literature search and independently screened abstracts for inclusion, with resolution of any difference by three other authors. Studies were included when data on surgical management (shaving, disc excision and/ or segmental resection) were provided and when postoperative outcomes were detailed with at least the number of complications. The risk of bias was assessed according to the Cochrane recommendations. TABULATION, INTEGRATION, AND RESULTS Of the168 full-text articles assessed for eligibility, 60 were included in the qualitative synthesis. Seventeen of these were included in the meta-analysis on rectovaginal fistula, 10 on anastomotic leakage, five on anastomotic stenosis, and nine on voiding dysfunction <30 days. The mean complication rate according to shaving, discoid excision and segmental resection were 2.2%, 9.7% and 9.9%, respectively. Rectal shaving was less associated with rectovaginal fistula than discoid excision (OR=0.19; 95% CI [0.10-0.36], p<0.00001, I2=33%) and segmental colorectal resection (OR=0.26, 95% IC [0.15-0.44], p<0.00001, I2=0%). No difference was found in the occurrence of rectovaginal fistula between discoid excision and segmental colorectal resection (OR=1.07, 95%CI [0.70-1.63], p=0.76, I2=0%). Rectal shaving was less associated with leakage than disc excision (OR=0.22, 95% IC [0.06-0.73], p=0.01, I2=86%). No difference was found in the occurrence of leakage between rectal shaving and segmental colorectal resection (OR=0.32, 95% IC [0.10-1.01], p=0.05, I2=71%) or between disc excision and segmental colorectal resection (OR=0.32, 95% IC [0.30-1.58], p=0.38, I2=0%). Disc excision was less associated with anastomotic stenosis than segmental resection (OR=0.15, 95% IC [0.05-0.48], p=0.001, I2=59%). Disc excision was associated with more voiding dysfunction <30 days than rectal shaving (OR=12.9, 95% IC [1.40-119.34], p=0.02, I2=0%). No difference was found in the occurrence of voiding dysfunction <30 days between segmental resection and rectal shaving (OR=3.05, 95% IC [0.55-16.87], p=0.20, I2=0%) or between segmental colorectal and discoid resection (OR=0.99, 95% IC [0.54-1.85], p=0.99, I2=71%). CONCLUSION Colorectal surgery for endometriosis exposes patients to a risk of severe complications such as rectovaginal fistula, anastomotic leakage, anastomotic stenosis and voiding dysfunction. Rectal shaving appears to be less associated with postoperative complications than disc excision and segmental colorectal resection. However, this technique is not suitable in all patients with large bowel infiltration. Compared to segmental colorectal resection, disc excision has several advantages including shorter operating time, shorter hospital stay and lower risk of postoperative bowel stenosis.

All people can benefit from education about how to have healthy friendships and dating relationships. But specific interventions on relationship skills-like respecting boundaries, identifying warning signs of abuse, or talking about sexual preferences-are too rare, particularly for autistic individuals.

Twenty-five autistic youth aged 16-22 years old were interviewed.What this paper adds? The participants described a need for more and better information about how to support lasting friendships, deal with their anxiety about relationships, and know when friendships or dating relationships were reciprocal and rewarding versus unhealthy.Implications for practice, research, or policy. The results reveal a need for a new and effective intervention that supports healthy relationship skills for autistic people.","Rothman, Emily F; Graham Holmes, Laura",Autism : the international journal of research and practice,188,11

Besides sex differences, age has also a possible effect on functional outcome. The interaction of sex on the functional outcome in IVT-treated patients in relation to age remains complex. The purpose of this study was to compare outcome after IVT between women and men with regard to age in a large multicenter European cohort reflecting daily clinical practice of acute stroke care. METHODS Data were obtained from IVT registries of 12 European tertiary hospitals. The primary outcome was poor functional outcome, defined as a modified Rankin scale score of 3 to 6 at 3 months. We stratified outcome by age in decades. Safety measures were symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage and mortality at 3 months. RESULTS In this cohort, 9495 patients were treated with IVT, and 4170 (43.9%) were women with a mean age of 71.9 years. After adjustments for baseline differences, female sex remained associated with poor functional outcome (odds ratio, 1.15; 95% confidence interval, 1.02-1.31). There was no association between sex and functional outcome when data were stratified by age. Symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage rate was similar in both sexes (adjusted odds ratio, 0.93; 95% confidence interval, 0.73-1.19), whereas mortality was lower among women (adjusted odds ratio, 0.83; 95% confidence interval, 0.70-0.99). CONCLUSIONS In this large cohort of IVT-treated patients, women more often had poor functional outcome compared with men. This difference was not dependent on age.","Spaander, Fianne H; Zinkstok, Sanne M; Baharoglu, Irem M; Gensicke, Henrik; Polymeris, Alexandros; Traenka, Christopher; Hametner, Christian; Ringleb, Peter; Curtze, Sami; Martinez-Majander, Nicolas; Aarnio, Karoliina; Nolte, Christian H; Scheitz, Jan F; Leys, Didier; Hochart, Anais; Padjen, Visnja; Kägi, Georg; Pezzini, Alessandro; Michel, Patrik; Bill, Olivier; Zini, Andrea; Engelter, Stefan T; Nederkoorn, Paul J",Stroke,188,31

This pandemic disease has now been defined as novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), and is sustained by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). As the current gold standard for the etiological diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection is (real time) reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) on respiratory tract specimens, the diagnostic accuracy of this technique shall be considered a foremost prerequisite. Overall, potential RT-PCR vulnerabilities include general preanalytical issues such as identification problems, inadequate procedures for collection, handling, transport and storage of the swabs, collection of inappropriate or inadequate material (for quality or volume), presence of interfering substances, manual errors, as well as specific aspects such as sample contamination and testing patients receiving antiretroviral therapy. Some analytical problems may also contribute to jeopardize the diagnostic accuracy, including testing outside the diagnostic window, active viral recombination, use of inadequately validated assays, insufficient harmonization, instrument malfunctioning, along with other specific technical issues. Some practical indications can hence be identified for minimizing the risk of diagnostic errors, encompassing the improvement of diagnostic accuracy by combining clinical evidence with results of chest computed tomography (CT) and RT-PCR, interpretation of RT-PCR results according to epidemiologic, clinical and radiological factors, recollection and testing of upper (or lower) respiratory specimens in patients with negative RT-PCR test results and high suspicion or probability of infection, dissemination of clear instructions for specimen (especially swab) collection, management and storage, together with refinement of molecular target(s) and thorough compliance with analytical procedures, including quality assurance.","Lippi, Giuseppe; Simundic, Ana-Maria; Plebani, Mario",Clinical chemistry and laboratory medicine,188,17

Chinese medicine (CM) is widely used for the management of AD in China not only by its own, but also used in combination with conventional therapy (integrated Chinese-Western medicine, ICWM). Although many clinical trials on the effectiveness of ICWM on AD have been conducted, however, up to date, no sound evidence has been established on the clinical effectiveness and safety of ICWM for AD. OBJECTIVES To systematically review the currently available clinical evidence on the clinical effectiveness and safety of ICWM for AD. METHODS Randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials, which investigated ICWM interventions with at least one control group using the same conventional interventions, no treatment or placebo treatment, were included. Four English (CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, AMED) and three Chinese (CNKI, CBM, WanFang Med) databases were searched. Risk of bias was assessed according to the Cochrane's tool. Meta-analysis was performed to pool the data. RESULTS From 1473 entries, 55 studies were included, involving 5953 participants aged between 35 days and 67 years old. Duration of treatment ranged from 1 to 24 weeks. Only 2 studies were judged to have low risk of bias, 3 studies had unclear risk of bias, and the other 50 studies were with high risk of bias. ICWM was found to be superior over WM alone in improving clinical severity of AD (measured by EASI, SCORAD), health-related quality of life (measured by CDLQI, DLQI), long term control of AD (recurrence rate), patients/investigator global score (clinical effectiveness rate), and serum IgE level. Adverse events associated with ICWM were found to be comparable with WM alone. CONCLUSION ICWM seems to produce superior treatment response than WM alone in managing AD without increased risk of adverse events. However, the current available evidence remains too weak to make a conclusive decision.","Sum, Chi Him; Ching, Jessica; Zhang, Hongwei; Loo, Steven; Lo, Cho Wing; Lai, Mei Kwan; Cheong, Pui Kuan; Yu, Chau Leung; Lin, Zhi-Xiu",Chinese medicine,188,27

Epidemiologic analyses demonstrated two major IB virus (IBV) outbreak peaks, affecting mainly 35-to-49-day-old broiler chickens. California variant 1737 (CA1737) and California variant 1999 (Cal 99) IBV types were the most prevalent genotypes during the analyzed period. To further understand the increased prevalence of these genotypes, we assessed and compared the variability of the S1 gene hypervariable region of CA1737 and Cal 99 with the variability of IBV strains belonging to the Massachusetts 41 (M41) and Arkansas (Ark) types during serial passages in embryonated chicken eggs. On the basis of the S1 nonsynonymous changes, seven different subpopulations were detected in M41. However, the predominant population of the field strain M41 before passages continued to be predominant throughout the experiment. In contrast, Ark passaging resulted in the detection of 13 different subpopulations, and the field sequence became extinct after the first passage. In IBV Cal 99, eight different subpopulations were detected; one of these became predominant after the second passage. In CA1737, 10 different subpopulations were detected. The field strain major sequence was not detected after the first passage but reappeared after the second passage and remained at low levels throughout the experiment. Compared with M41 and Ark, Cal 99 and CA1737 showed intermediate variability.","Gallardo, R A; Aleuy, O A; Pitesky, M; Sentíes-Cué, G; Abdelnabi, A; Woolcock, P R; Hauck, R; Toro, H",Avian diseases,188,1

Cross-sectional study of 36,516 adults between 20 and 59 years of age taken from the 2012 Mexican National Health and Nutrition Survey. Depressive symptoms were evaluated using the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D), and the employment status was determined a week before the survey. Logistic regression models were stratified by gender and education level and adjusted by sociodemographic and health-related conditions to estimate the association between depressive symptoms and employment status. The prevalence of clinically depressive symptoms was 7.59% for men and 18.62% for women. In the case of men, those who were unemployed were more likely to present depressive symptoms (OR = 1.66; 95%CI: 1.08-2.55) than those who were working. For women, employment status is not associated with the presence of depressive symptoms, except in students (OR = 1.57; 95%CI: 1.02-2.43) compared with those who were working. In both genders, disability preventing one from working was associated with depressive symptoms. Although being employed has been reported to be associated with lower levels of psychiatric morbidity, the estimated effect is different for men and women.

Fourteen patients aged 23 (19.0; 24.8) years old (median [1rst-3rd quartiles]) with CCHS underwent a sleep interview and night-time attended polysomnography with their ventilatory support. Their sleep variables were compared to those collected in 15 healthy control subjects matched for age, sex and body mass index. RESULTS The latency to N3 sleep was shorter in patients (26.3 min [24.0; 30.1]) than in controls (49.5 min [34.3; 66.9]; P = 0.005), and sleep onset latency tended to be shorter in patients (14.0 min [7.0; 20.5]) than in controls (33.0 min [18.0; 49.0]; P = 0.052). Total sleep time, sleep stage percentages, sleep fragmentation as well as respiratory and movement index were within normal ranges and not different between groups. CONCLUSIONS Normal sleep in adult patients with CCHS and adequate ventilator support indicates that the PHOX2 gene mutations do not affect brain sleep networks. Consequently, any complaint of disrupted sleep should prompt clinicians to look for the usual causes of sleep disorders, primarily inadequate mechanical ventilation. Shorter N3 latency may indicate a higher need for slow wave sleep, to compensate for the abnormal respiratory-related cortical activity during awake quiet breathing observed in patients with CCH.","Attali, Valérie; Straus, Christian; Pottier, Michel; Buzare, Marie-Annick; Morélot-Panzini, Capucine; Arnulf, Isabelle; Similowski, Thomas",Orphanet journal of rare diseases,188,16

OBJECTIVE To identify, risk-stratify, and monitor contacts of patients with Ebola. DESIGN Descriptive investigation. SETTING Dallas County, Texas, September to November 2014. PARTICIPANTS Contacts of symptomatic patients with Ebola. MEASUREMENTS Contact identification, exposure risk classification, symptom development, and Ebola. RESULTS The investigation identified 179 contacts, 139 of whom were contacts of the index patient. Of 112 health care personnel (HCP) contacts of the index case, 22 (20%) had known unprotected exposures and 37 (30%) did not have known unprotected exposures but interacted with a patient or contaminated environment on multiple days. Transmission was confirmed in 2 HCP who had substantial interaction with the patient while wearing personal protective equipment. These HCP had 40 additional contacts. Of 20 community contacts of the index patient or the 2 HCP, 4 had high-risk exposures. Movement restrictions were extended to all 179 contacts; 7 contacts were quarantined. Seven percent (14 of 179) of contacts (1 community contact and 13 health care contacts) were evaluated for Ebola during the monitoring period. LIMITATION Data cannot be used to infer whether in-person direct active monitoring is superior to active monitoring alone for early detection of symptomatic contacts. CONCLUSION Contact tracing and monitoring approaches for Ebola were adapted to account for the evolving understanding of risks for unrecognized HCP transmission. HCP contacts in the United States without known unprotected exposures should be considered as having a low (but not zero) risk for Ebola and should be actively monitored for symptoms. Core challenges of contact tracing for high-consequence communicable diseases included rapid comprehensive contact identification, large-scale direct active monitoring of contacts, large-scale application of movement restrictions, and necessity of humanitarian support services to meet nonclinical needs of contacts.

Histamine is responsible for many of the acute symptoms of allergic diseases. Many of the allergic and inflammatory actions of histamine are mediated by the histamine H1 receptor. In the present study, we established a two-dimensional histamine H1 receptor/cell membrane chromatography with online high-performance liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry method for screening potential histamine-activating components in a traditional Chinese medicine injection. The specification of the method was validated by screening, separating, and identifying a mixed standard solution of diphenhydramine hydrochloride, gefitinib, tamsulosin, and nitrendipine. The Yujin injection, an example of traditional Chinese medicine injection, was screened and potential allergic components acting on the histamine H1 receptor were identified. A Ca(2+) flux assay showed that houttuyfonate and Yujin injection induced calcium release in a dose-dependent manner. This suggests that houttuyfonate is an activator of the histamine H1 receptor. The mechanism of houttuyfonate activation involves phosphorylation of the inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor.

Managing medication in NHRs is a priority, but prone to several challenges, including interprofessional cooperation. Against this background, we implemented and tested an interprofessional intervention aimed to improve medication appropriateness for NHRs. METHODS A non-randomized controlled study (SiMbA; ""Sicherheit der Medikamentherapie bei AltenheimbewohnerInnen"", Safety of medication therapy in NHRs) was conducted in six nursing homes in Austria (2016-2018). Educational training, introduction of tailored health information technology (HIT) and a therapy check process were combined in an intervention aimed at healthcare professionals. Medication appropriateness was assessed using the Medication Appropriateness Index (MAI). Data was collected before (t0), during (t1, month 12) and after (t2, month 18) intervention via self-administered assessments and electronic health records. RESULTS We included 6 NHs, 17 GPs (52.94% female) and 240 NHRs (68.75% female; mean age 85.0). Data of 159 NHRs could be included in the analysis. Mean MAI-change was - 3.35 (IG) vs. - 1.45 (CG). In the subgroup of NHRs with mean MAI ≥23, MAI-change was - 10.31 (IG) vs. -3.52 (CG). The intervention was a significant predictor of improvement in MAI when controlled for in a multivariable regression model. CONCLUSIONS Improvement of medication appropriateness was clearest in residents with inappropriate baseline MAI-scores. This improvement was independent of variances in certain covariates between the intervention and the control group. We conclude that our intervention is a feasible approach to improve NHRs' medication appropriateness. TRIAL REGISTRATION DRKS Data Management, ID: DRKS00012246 .

Most individuals with trichotillomania also have other comorbid diagnoses. Treating trichotillomania with pharmacotherapy is complicated since there are currently no FDA-approved drugs for its treatment. AREAS COVERED The databases PubMed, PsychINFO, CINAHL, Evidence-based Medicine Reviews, and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews were searched, yielding a total of 10 open trials and 10 controlled trials selected. This review aims to examine pharmacotherapeutic options for the treatment of trichotillomania in adults and makes recommendations for the assessment and management of the disorder. EXPERT OPINION There is preliminary evidence that clomipramine, olanzapine, and N-acetylcysteine may be effective in cases of trichotillomania, however, given the paucity of controlled studies with large sample sizes, decisions regarding the use of drugs should be made on a case-by-case basis taking into account the severity of trichotillomania and the nature of psychiatric comorbidity.","Baczynski, Christine; Sharma, Verinder",Expert opinion on pharmacotherapy,188,8

Preventative measures reduce injury incidence and/or severity, yet one-third of hospitalized patients with TBI die from secondary pathological processes that develop during supervised care. Neutrophils, which orchestrate innate immune responses, worsen TBI outcomes via undefined mechanisms. We hypothesized that formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), a purported mechanism of microbial trapping, exacerbates acute neurological injury after TBI. NET formation coincided with cerebral hypoperfusion and tissue hypoxia after experimental TBI, while elevated circulating NETs correlated with reduced serum deoxyribonuclease-1 (DNase-I) activity in patients with TBI. Functionally, Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) and the downstream kinase peptidylarginine deiminase 4 (PAD4) mediated NET formation and cerebrovascular dysfunction after TBI. Last, recombinant human DNase-I degraded NETs and improved neurological function. Thus, therapeutically targeting NETs may provide a mechanistically innovative approach to improve TBI outcomes without the associated risks of global neutrophil depletion.","Vaibhav, Kumar; Braun, Molly; Alverson, Katelyn; Khodadadi, Hesam; Kutiyanawalla, Ammar; Ward, Ayobami; Banerjee, Christopher; Sparks, Tyler; Malik, Aneeq; Rashid, Mohammad H; Khan, Mohammad Badruzzaman; Waters, Michael F; Hess, David C; Arbab, Ali S; Vender, John R; Hoda, Nasrul; Baban, Babak; Dhandapani, Krishnan M",Science advances,188,27

These crises were met with both a counterproductive and inadequate response from the federal government. We examine these converging crises at the individual, social, and political scales. The biological realities of COVID-19 impact different populations in widely varied ways-the poor, the elderly, Black, Indigenous, and people of color, and those living with comorbidities get sick and die at the highest rates. Social distancing guidelines shifted millions of people to work-from-home and millions more lost their jobs, even as care laborers, preponderantly women, Black, Indigenous, and people of color, were asked to put their and their loved ones' lives on the line for the continuation of all of our lives. These biological, social, and economic crises have been punctuated by civil unrest, as millions took to the streets for racial justice, noting the unequal impacts of the pandemic. These converging crises have laid bare decades of neoliberal and neoconservative policies and ideologies, undergirded as they have been by racial capitalism, for their fundamental uncaringness. In this paper, we argue that this pandemic not only made a wider population more acutely aware of the necessity and importance of the need to care and for caring labors, but also that we stand at the precipice of potentiality--of producing a more caring society. To frame our argument, we draw on Nancy Scheper-Hughes and Margaret Lock's (1987) framework of three bodies-individual, social, and political-to unpack the multi-scalar entanglements in the differential impacts of COVID-19, questions of care, and their articulation in the current political-economic context.","Lopez, Patricia J; Neely, Abigail H",Social science & medicine,188,31

We developed recommendations for monitoring outside the ICU on the basis of available evidence and expert opinion. METHODS We conducted a comprehensive literature search for studies addressing the utility of cardiorespiratory and pulse oximetry monitoring in common pediatric conditions and drafted candidate monitoring recommendations based on our findings. We convened a panel of nominees from national professional organizations with diverse expertise: nursing, medicine, respiratory therapy, biomedical engineering, and family advocacy. Using the RAND/University of California, Los Angeles Appropriateness Method, panelists rated recommendations for appropriateness and necessity in 3 sequential rating sessions and a moderated meeting. RESULTS The panel evaluated 56 recommendations for intermittent and continuous monitoring for children hospitalized outside the ICU with 7 common conditions (eg, asthma, croup) and/or receiving common therapies (eg, supplemental oxygen, intravenous opioids). The panel reached agreement on the appropriateness of monitoring recommendations for 55 of 56 indications and on necessity of monitoring for 52. For mild or moderate asthma, croup, pneumonia, and bronchiolitis, the panel recommended intermittent vital sign or oximetry measurement only. The panel recommended continuous monitoring for severe disease in each respiratory condition as well as for a new or increased dose of intravenous opiate or benzodiazepine. CONCLUSIONS Expert panel members agreed that intermittent vital sign assessment, rather than continuous monitoring, is appropriate management for a set of specific conditions of mild or moderate severity that require hospitalization.","Schondelmeyer, Amanda C; Dewan, Maya L; Brady, Patrick W; Timmons, Kristen M; Cable, Rhonda; Britto, Maria T; Bonafide, Christopher P",Pediatrics,188,1

It is known that podocytes express the Rabphilin 3A (RPH3A)-Rab3A complex, and its expression is altered in mouse and human proteinuric disease. Furthermore, we previously identified a polymorphism that suggested a role for RPH3A protein in the development of urinary albumin excretion. Since endocytosis and vesicle trafficking are fundamental pathways for nephrocytes, the objective here is to assess the role of the RPH3A ortholog in Drosophila, Rabphilin (Rph), in the structure and function of nephrocytes. We have confirmed that Rph is required for the endocytic pathway to function correctly in pericardial Drosophila nephrocytes. Knockdown of Rph reduces the expression of cubilin and stick and stones genes, which encode proteins that are involved in protein uptake and filtration. We also found that reduced Rph expression results in a disappearance of the labyrinthine channel structure and a reduction in the number of endosomes, which ultimately leads to changes in the number and volume of nephrocytes. Finally, we described that administration of retinoic acid to IR-Rph nephrocytes rescued some altered aspects as the filtration and molecular uptake as well as the maintenance of cell fate. According to our data, Rph is crucial for the nephrocyte's filtration and reabsorption and it is required for the maintenance of the nephrocyte's ultrastructure, integrity, and differentiation.","Selma-Soriano, Estela; Llamusi, Beatriz; Fernández-Costa, Juan Manuel; Ozimski, Lauren Louise; Artero, Rubén; Redón, Josep",Disease models & mechanisms,188,1

One possible cause for this may be the previous use of relatively high (2 mA) current intensities, which have inconsistent effects on corticospinal excitability. The present pre-registered study aimed to replicate previously reported ergogenic effects of 2 mA tDCS, and examine whether 1 mA anodal tDCS both improved isometric exercise performance and perceived fatigue, and more reliably altered corticospinal excitability. On three separate occasions, participants performed a sustained submaximal isometric knee extension until failure after receiving either 1 mA, 2mA or sham anodal tDCS. Corticospinal excitability of the knee extensors was measured using transcranial magnetic stimulation immediately before and after tDCS. Rating of fatigue was recorded throughout the isometric exercise. Neither 1 nor 2 mA tDCS improved exercise performance, or reduced perceived fatigue, compared to sham stimulation. There was also no effect of tDCS on the corticospinal excitability of the knee extensors. We found no effect of tDCS on either exercise performance, perceived fatigue or corticospinal excitability. This study adds to the growing body of literature reporting no ergogenic effect of tDCS. Large preregistered replications of previously reported effects are now required before tDCS can be considered an effective method to improve exercise performance.","Wrightson, J G; Twomey, R; Yeung, S T; Millet, G Y",The European journal of neuroscience,188,1

Self-imposed barriers have prevented adoption of more radical pedagogical approaches, so recent predictions of the 'inevitability' of medical education transitioning to online delivery seemed unlikely. Then in March 2020 the COVID-19 pandemic forced medical schools to overcome established barriers overnight and make the most rapid curricular shift in medical education's history. We share the collated reports of nine medical schools and postulate how recent responses may influence future medical education. Evidence: While extraneous pandemic-related factors make it impossible to scientifically distinguish the impact of the curricular changes, some themes emerged. The rapid transition to online delivery was made possible by all schools having learning management systems and key electronic resources already blended into their curricula; we were closer to online delivery than anticipated. Student engagement with online delivery varied with different pedagogies used and the importance of social learning and interaction along with autonomy in learning were apparent. These are factors known to enhance online learning, and the student-centered modalities (e.g. problem-based learning) that included them appeared to be more engaging. Assumptions that the new online environment would be easily adopted and embraced by 'technophilic' students did not always hold true. Achieving true distance medical education will take longer than this 'overnight' response, but adhering to best practices for online education may open a new realm of possibilities. Implications: While this experience did not confirm that online medical education is really 'inevitable,' it revealed that it is possible. Thoughtfully blending more online components into a medical curriculum will allow us to take advantage of this environment's strengths such as efficiency and the ability to support asynchronous and autonomous learning that engage and foster intrinsic learning in our students. While maintaining aspects of social interaction, online learning could enhance pre-clinical medical education by allowing integration and collaboration among classes of medical students, other health professionals, and even between medical schools. What remains to be seen is whether COVID-19 provided the experience, vision and courage for medical education to change, or whether the old barriers will rise again when the pandemic is over.","Binks, Andrew P; LeClair, Renée J; Willey, Joanne M; Brenner, Judith M; Pickering, James D; Moore, Jesse S; Huggett, Kathryn N; Everling, Kathleen M; Arnott, John A; Croniger, Colleen M; Zehle, Christa H; Kranea, N Kevin; Schwartzstein, Richard M",Teaching and learning in medicine,188,27

METHODOLOGY Fifty-four patients with severe COVID-19 fulfilled the inclusion criteria and were included. All patients had received TCZ (4 mg/kg) in addition to standard treatment. Serum C-reactive protein (CRP), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), D-dimer levels, full blood count, and liver function tests (LFTs) were checked before and 24 hours after receiving TCZ. Short-term outcome, defined as survival at day 28, was determined from hospital record/telephonic contact. Paired t-test was employed to assess the statistical significance of mean differences between the pre- and post-TCZ variables, considering a p-value of <0.05 as significant. RESULTS Overall, the mean pre- and post-TCZ CRP was 18.7 ± 10.7 and 10.2 ± 8.6 mg/dl (p <0.001).

The impact of telehealth on patient satisfaction during the current pandemic is yet to be fully understood. Objective: This study aimed to identify patient perspectives and behaviors toward virtual primary care appointments at a telehealth-naïve institution during the COVID-19 pandemic and establish the rate of missed appointments to help guide future implementation of telehealth services. Methods: Patients at a primary and specialty care clinic, seen between March and May 2020, completed a survey analyzing nine commonly used satisfaction metrics. The rate of missed appointments was recorded and compared with analogous cohorts of in-person office visits. Results: The no-show rate of telehealth visits during the COVID-19 pandemic was 7.5% (14/186), lower than both the no-show rate of 36.1% for in-office visits (56/155) (p < 0.0001) and a pre-pandemic in-office no-show rate of 29.8% (129/433) (p < 0.0001). Surveyed patients who experienced telehealth visits (n = 65) had similar satisfaction compared with those surveyed who attended in-office visits (n = 36) in seven of nine metrics. No statistically significant differences were identified in the satisfaction metrics with telehealth visits performed on video (n = 26) versus the phone-only format (n = 38).

We tested whether a combination of aliskiren and amlodipine is superior to each monotherapy in early control of blood pressure without excess of adverse events, and if initial control by monotherapy impairs subsequent control by combination therapy. METHODS We did a double-blind, randomised, parallel-group, superiority trial at 146 primary and secondary care sites in ten countries, with enrolment from Nov 28, 2008, to July 15, 2009. Patients eligible for enrolment had essential hypertension, were aged 18 years or older, and had systolic blood pressure between 150 and 180 mm Hg. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1:2) to treatment with 150 mg aliskiren plus placebo, 5 mg amlodipine plus placebo, or 150 mg aliskiren plus 5 mg amlodipine. Random assignment was through a central interactive voice response system and treatment allocation was masked from the patients. From 16-32 weeks, all patients received combination therapy with 300 mg aliskiren plus 10 mg amlodipine. Our primary endpoints, assessed on an intention-to-treat basis (ie, in patients who received the allocated treatment), were the adjusted mean reduction in systolic blood pressure from baseline over 8 to 24 weeks, and then the final reduction at 24 weeks. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00797862. FINDINGS 318 patients were randomly assigned to aliskiren, 316 to amlodipine, and 620 to aliskiren plus amlodipine. 315 patients initially allocated to aliskiren, 315 allocated to amlodipine, and 617 allocated to aliskiren plus amlodipine were available for analysis. Patients given initial combination therapy had a 6·5 mm Hg (95% CI 5·3 to 7·7) greater reduction in mean systolic blood pressure than the monotherapy groups (p<0·0001). At 24 weeks, when all patients were on combination treatment, the difference was 1·4 mm Hg (95% CI -0·05 to 2·9; p=0·059). Adverse events caused withdrawal of 85 patients (14%) from the initial aliskiren plus amlodipine group, 45 (14%) from the aliskiren group, and 58 (18%) from the amlodipine group. Adverse events were peripheral oedema, hypotension, or orthostatic hypotension.

These facilities are vulnerable to disease outbreaks and an assessment of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) testing and outcomes is needed. The objective of this study was to examine outcomes of COVID-19 testing, prevalence, case recovery and death within federal prisons and to contrast these data with those of the general population. Methods Public time-series outcome data for prisoners and the general population were obtained on-line from the Correctional Service of Canada and the Public Health Agency of Canada, respectively, from March 30 to May 27, 2020. Prison, province and sex-specific frequency statistics for each outcome were calculated. A total of 50 facilities were included in this study. Results Of these 50 facilities, 64% reported fewer individuals tested per 1,000 population than observed in the general population and 12% reported zero tests in the study period. Testing tended to be reactive, increasing only once prisons had recorded positive tests. Six prisons reported viral outbreaks, with three recording over 20% cumulative COVID-19 prevalence among prisoners. Cumulatively, in prisons, 29% of individuals tested received a positive result, compared to 6% in the general population. Two of the 360 cases died (0.6% fatality). Four outbreaks appeared to be under control (more than 80% of cases recovered); however, sizeable susceptible populations remain at risk of infection. Female prisoners (5% of the total prisoner population) were over-represented among cases (17% of cases overall). Conclusion Findings suggest that prison environments are vulnerable to widespread severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) transmission. Gaps in testing merit public health attention. Symptom-based testing alone may not be optimal in prisons, given observations of widespread transmission. Increased sentinel or universal testing may be appropriate. Increased testing, along with rigorous infection prevention practices and the potential release of prisoners, will be needed to curb future outbreaks.","Blair, Alexandra; Parnia, Abtin; Siddiqi, Arjumand",Canada communicable disease report = Releve des maladies transmissibles au Canada,188,12

It is a long-term change in weather patterns that characterises different regions of the world. The warming effect in the earth's atmosphere has dramatically increased through the influence of some heat-taping gases emitted by various human activities, especially fossil fuel burning. The more the input of such gases, the more will be the warming effect in the coming times. Global climate change is already visible in various parts of the larger ecosystems like forests, fisheries, biodiversity, and agriculture; however, it is now also influencing the supply of freshwater, human health, and well-being. This paper reviews climate change drivers, its global scenario, major global events, and assessing climate change impacts. The most daunting problem of economic and ecological risks, along with the threats to humanity, is also discussed. The paper further reviews the species' vulnerability to climate change and the heat waves and human migration vis-à-vis climate change. Climate change politics and coverage of climate change episodes in mass media is the special focus of this review that concludes with a few mitigation measures.","Bandh, Suhaib A; Shafi, Sana; Peerzada, Mohazeb; Rehman, Tanzeela; Bashir, Shahnaz; Wani, Shahid A; Dar, Rubiya",Environmental science and pollution research international,188,1

There have been noteworthy efforts to bridge the gap in under resourced areas. An analysis of the global burden of rheumatic disease has demonstrated that while understudied, musculoskeletal diseases are prevalent and increasingly contribute to loss of years of healthy life. In juvenile idiopathic arthritis, two milestone publications in global pediatric rheumatology have recently been published. An international study evaluated the epidemiology, treatment, and outcomes of juvenile idiopathic arthritis and demonstrated global diversity in both clinical manifestations and outcomes. Notably, the first guidelines for managing pediatric rheumatic disease in a less resourced setting have been published for juvenile idiopathic arthritis. This document offers the first publication targeted to address challenges faced by pediatric rheumatology caregivers in low-resourced settings. These documents serve as exemplars for the international collaboration in pediatric rheumatology and can be used as models for other pediatric rheumatic disease research. Other efforts are making progress in various arenas towards increasing access to care, education, and training in pediatric rheumatology. SUMMARY The global burden of rheumatic disease in the pediatric population is poorly understood but unrecognized disease greatly impacts the overall morbidity and mortality in this population. More studies in lesser resourced regions are needed to prioritize access to pediatric rheumatology care and prioritize a further increase in research capacity and education moving forward.","Lewandowski, Laura B",Current opinion in rheumatology,188,17

Unexpectedly, pharmacological MMP inhibition increased anastomotic leakage (AL) in obstructed colon possibly due to the non-selective nature of these compounds and the experimental model applied. We therefore studied the effects of selective MMP inhibition on the healing of anastomoses in colon obstructed by a novel laparoscopic technique. METHODS Left colon was obstructed in 38 male Sprague-Dawley rats (226-284 g). After 12 h, stenoses were resected and end-to-end anastomoses constructed. Baseline breaking strength was determined in 6 animals on day 0. The remaining 32 rats were randomized to daily treatment with the selective MMP-8, MMP-9, and MMP-12 inhibitor AZD3342 (n = 16) or vehicle (n = 16). On day 3, anastomoses were evaluated for AL and breaking strength. Isolated anastomotic wound tissue was analyzed on total collagen and pepsin-insoluble and pepsin-soluble collagen by hydroxyproline. The soluble collagens were further differentiated into native, measured by Sircol, and fragmented forms. RESULTS Baseline breaking strength was maintained with AZD3342 but decreased by 25% (P = 0.023) in the vehicle group. The anastomotic breaking strength of AZD3342-treated rats was 44% higher (P = 0.008) than the vehicle-treated rats. Furthermore, the AL rate was reduced (P = 0.037) with AZD3342 compared with vehicle treatment. AZD3342 treatment influenced neither the total or insoluble collagen concentrations nor the degree of fragmentation of the soluble collagen triple helices. CONCLUSION Selective MMP inhibition increased anastomotic breaking strength and reduced AL after resection of colonic obstruction.","Krarup, Peter-Martin; Eld, Mikkel; Jorgensen, Lars Nannestad; Hansen, Mark Berner; Ågren, Magnus S",International journal of colorectal disease,188,11

OBJECTIVE The objective of this study was to investigate the tolerability and pharmacokinetic properties of HM30181 after single and multiple oral administrations to healthy Korean male volunteers. The study was performed to meet regulatory criteria for marketing the test product in South Korea. METHODS A dose-block-randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-escalation study was performed in 180-, 360-, 600-, and 900-mg single-dose groups and 60-, 180-, and 360-mg multiple-dose groups with 10 subjects (8 active; 2 placebo) per group. In the single-dose study, blood and urine samples were collected for up to 120 hours after drug administration. In the multiple-dose study, subjects received the study drug or placebo orally once daily for 5 days. Blood samples were collected up to 624 hours after the last dose, and up to 24 hours after the first dose to evaluate the accumulation index. Urine samples were collected up to 120 hours after the last dose. Pharmacokinetic analysis was performed using noncompartmental methods. Adverse events were collected by the spontaneous reporting of the subjects or when subjects were asked general health-related questions. RESULTS Thirty and 70 healthy male volunteers completed the single- and multiple-dose studies, respectively. Mean (SD) age and body weight of subjects in the single administration group were 24.0 (1.8) years and 68.8 (7.4) kg, respectively, and those of the multiple administration group were 24.5 (2.6) years and 67.6 (7.7) kg, respectively. The plasma concentrations peaked at 14 to 42 hours and declined with t(½) of 75.7 to 169.3 hours after single administration, and peaked at 5.5 to 8.0 hours and declined with t(½) of 153.5 to 215.2 hours after multiple administrations. C(max) and area under the concentration curve within dosing intervals (AUC(τ)) increased dose dependently after single administration; however, dose-dependent increases in C(max) and AUC(τ) were not observed after multiple administrations. The fraction of drug excreted unchanged in urine was minimal, with values <0.01% in all dose groups. HM30181 accumulated after multiple administrations with an accumulation index of 4.0 to 7.4. All adverse events reported were mild in intensity; there were no serious adverse events reported. The most frequently reported adverse event was gastrointestinal disorder. CONCLUSIONS HM30181 was well tolerated after oral administration within the dose range evaluated, with the exception of the repeated administration of 360 mg, for which gastrointestinal disorders were frequently reported. The systemic exposure of HM30181 was relatively low, and dose proportional properties of HM30181 were not observed.","Kim, Tae-Eun; Gu, Namyi; Yoon, Seo Hyun; Cho, Joo-Youn; Park, Kyung-Mi; Shin, Sang-Goo; Jang, In-Jin; Yu, Kyung-Sang",Clinical therapeutics,188,19

METHODS This was a retrospective study of 306 patients (135 men, 171 women; mean age, 30.8 years) with body and extremity AVMs who were treated between 1996 and 2017. A total of 913 sessions of endovascular treatment were performed. Patients were divided into two decades of the study period to compare complications and clinical results. Group 1 comprised 107 patients treated in the first decade of the study period, and group 2 comprised 199 patients treated in the last decade. AVMs were classified according to the angiographic findings. Complication rates, number of treatment sessions, and treatment results were compared between the two groups. RESULTS Minor complication (group 1, 20.1%; group 2, 18.5%) and major complication (group 1, 3.1%; group 2, 4.1%) rates were similar between groups (P = .79). The mean number of treatment sessions in group 1 and group 2 was 4.2 and 2.3, respectively, indicating a 45% reduction in treatment sessions (P < .0001).

The key immune cell subsets change and their states during the course of COVID-19 remain unclear. We sought to comprehensively characterize the transcriptional changes in peripheral blood mononuclear cells during the recovery stage of COVID-19 by single-cell RNA sequencing technique. It was found that T cells decreased remarkably, whereas monocytes increased in patients in the early recovery stage (ERS) of COVID-19. There was an increased ratio of classical CD14++ monocytes with high inflammatory gene expression as well as a greater abundance of CD14++IL1β+ monocytes in the ERS. CD4+ T cells and CD8+ T cells decreased significantly and expressed high levels of inflammatory genes in the ERS. Among the B cells, the plasma cells increased remarkably, whereas the naïve B cells decreased. Several novel B cell-receptor (BCR) changes were identified, such as IGHV3-23 and IGHV3-7, and isotypes (IGHV3-15, IGHV3-30, and IGKV3-11) previously used for virus vaccine development were confirmed. The strongest pairing frequencies, IGHV3-23-IGHJ4, indicated a monoclonal state associated with SARS-CoV-2 specificity, which had not been reported yet. Furthermore, integrated analysis predicted that IL-1β and M-CSF may be novel candidate target genes for inflammatory storm and that TNFSF13, IL-18, IL-2, and IL-4 may be beneficial for the recovery of COVID-19 patients. Our study provides the first evidence of an inflammatory immune signature in the ERS, suggesting COVID-19 patients are still vulnerable after hospital discharge. Identification of novel BCR signaling may lead to the development of vaccines and antibodies for the treatment of COVID-19.","Wen, Wen; Su, Wenru; Tang, Hao; Le, Wenqing; Zhang, Xiaopeng; Zheng, Yingfeng; Liu, Xiuxing; Xie, Lihui; Li, Jianmin; Ye, Jinguo; Dong, Liwei; Cui, Xiuliang; Miao, Yushan; Wang, Depeng; Dong, Jiantao; Xiao, Chuanle; Chen, Wei; Wang, Hongyang",Cell discovery,188,17

As India already has inadequate waste treatment facilities, and the sudden outbreak of the COVID-19 virus has led to significant growth of Bio-medical waste (BMW), consequently safe disposal of a large quantity of waste has become a more serious concern. This study provides a comprehensive assessment of BMW of India before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, this article highlights the gaps in the implementation of BMW rules in India. This study uses various government and non-government organizations, reports and data specifically from the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB). The finding of the study demonstrated that most of the States/Union Territories (UTs) of India are lacking in terms of COVID-19 waste management. India has generated over 32,996 mt of COVID-19 waste between June and December 2020. During this period, Maharashtra (789.99 mt/month) is highest average generator of COVID-19 waste, followed by Kerala (459.86 mt/month), Gujarat (434.87 mt/month), Tamil Nadu (427.23 mt/month), Uttar Pradesh (371.39 mt/month), Delhi (358.83 mt/month) and West Bengal (303.15 mt/month), and others respectively. We draw attention to the fact that many gaps were identified with compliance of BMW management rules. For example, out of all 35 States/UTs, health care facilitates (HCFs), only eight states received authorization as per BMW management rules. Moreover, the government strictly restricted the practice of deep burials; however, 23 States/UTs are still using the deep burial methods for BMW disposal. The present research suggests that those States/UTs generated on an average of 100 mt/month COVID-19 waste in the last 7 months (June-December 2020) should be considered as a high priority state. These states need special attention to implement BMW rules and should upgrade their BMW treatment capacity.","Rajak, Rahul; Mahto, Ravi Kumar; Prasad, Jitender; Chattopadhyay, Aparajita","Waste management & research : the journal of the International Solid Wastes and Public Cleansing Association, ISWA",188,1

To address this, we analyzed the relationship between in vitro neutralization levels and the observed protection from severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection using data from seven current vaccines and from convalescent cohorts. We estimated the neutralization level for 50% protection against detectable SARS-CoV-2 infection to be 20.2% of the mean convalescent level (95% confidence interval (CI) = 14.4-28.4%). The estimated neutralization level required for 50% protection from severe infection was significantly lower (3% of the mean convalescent level; 95% CI = 0.7-13%, P = 0.0004). Modeling of the decay of the neutralization titer over the first 250 d after immunization predicts that a significant loss in protection from SARS-CoV-2 infection will occur, although protection from severe disease should be largely retained. Neutralization titers against some SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern are reduced compared with the vaccine strain, and our model predicts the relationship between neutralization and efficacy against viral variants. Here, we show that neutralization level is highly predictive of immune protection, and provide an evidence-based model of SARS-CoV-2 immune protection that will assist in developing vaccine strategies to control the future trajectory of the pandemic.","Khoury, David S; Cromer, Deborah; Reynaldi, Arnold; Schlub, Timothy E; Wheatley, Adam K; Juno, Jennifer A; Subbarao, Kanta; Kent, Stephen J; Triccas, James A; Davenport, Miles P",Nature medicine,188,1

The low frequency of these events leads to significant skill decay among first responders. To address skill decay and lack of experience with these high-impact events, educational modules were developed for mobile devices to provide just-in-time training to first responders en route to a CBRNE event. This study assessed the efficacy and usability of the mobile training. METHODS Ninety first responders were randomized to a control or an intervention group. All participants completed a pretest to measure knowledge of CBRNE topics. The intervention group then viewed personal protective equipment and weapons of mass destruction field management videos as an overview. Both groups were briefed on a disaster scenario (chemical nerve agent, radiologic, or explosives) requiring them to triage, assess, and manage a patient. Intervention group participants watched a mobile training video corresponding to the scenario. The control group did not receive prescenario video training. Observers rated participant performance in each scenario. After completing the scenarios, all participants answered a cognitive posttest. Those in the intervention group also answered a questionnaire on their impressions of the training. RESULTS The intervention group outperformed the control group in the explosives and chemical nerve agent scenarios; the differences were statistically significant (explosives, mean of 26.32 for intervention and 22.85 for control, p < 0.01; nerve agent, mean of 23.14 for intervention and 16.61 for control, p < 0.01). There was no statistically significant difference between the groups in the radiologic scenario (mean, 12.7 for intervention and 11.8 for control; p = 0.51). The change in pretest to posttest cognitive scores was significantly higher in the intervention group than in the control group (t = 3.28, p < 0.05). CONCLUSION Mobile just-in-time training improved first-responder knowledge of CBRNE events and is an effective tool in helping first responders manage simulated explosive and chemical agent scenarios.

Objective The objective of the study was to study the effect of the reduced form of methylene blue (MB) on the improvement of oxygen saturation (SpO2) and respiratory rate (RR). Methods In an academic medical center, 80 hospitalized patients with severe COVID-19 were randomly assigned to receive either oral MB along with standard of care (SOC) (MB group, n = 40) or SOC only (SOC group, n=40). The primary outcomes were SpO2 and RR on the 3rd and 5th days. The secondary outcomes were hospital stay and mortality within 28 days. Results In the MB group, a significant improvement in SpO2 and RR was observed on the 3rd day (for both, p < 0.0001) and also the 5th day (for both, p < 0.0001). In the SOC group, there was no significant improvement in SpO2 (p = 0.24) and RR (p = 0.20) on the 3rd day, although there was a significant improvement of SpO2 (p = 0.002) and RR (p = 0.01) on the 5th day. In the MB group in comparison to the SOC group, the rate ratio of increased SpO2 was 13.5 and 2.1 times on the 3rd and 5th days, respectively. In the MB group compared with the SOC group, the rate ratio of RR improvement was 10.1 and 3.7 times on the 3rd and 5th days, respectively. The hospital stay was significantly shortened in the MB group (p = 0.004), and the mortality was 12.5% and 22.5% in the MB and SOC groups, respectively. Conclusions The addition of MB to the treatment protocols significantly improved SpO2 and respiratory distress in COVID-19 patients, which resulted in decreased hospital stay and mortality.

Transit bipartition with sleeve gastrectomy is derived from biliopancreatic diversion with duodenal switch and might improve weight loss control. MATERIALS AND METHODS Two series of 71 primary laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) and transit bipartition (TB) with a body mass index ≥ 50 kg/m2 were retrospectively compared after 2 years. Postoperative course, side effects, nutritional status, and weight outcomes were reviewed. Weight was expressed as BMI, percentage of excess BMI lost (%EBMIL), and percentage of total weight lost (%TWL). RESULTS The 2 groups were comparable for age and BMI of 51.9 ± 1.8 for RYGB and 51.6 ± 5 for TB. TB was longer to perform (92 vs 74 min, p ≤ 0.001) with a 30-day complication rate of 4.2% and 5.6%, but there was 1 death after RYGB. Weight loss was greater after TB compared with RYGB with %EBMIL of 85.3 ± 15.8% vs 73.9 ± 17.2% (p = 0.0002). One TB patient suffered from protein malnutrition but none after RYGB. After TB, 7% of the patients experienced > 3 stools a day and 1 patient required revision, while 3 patients had diarrhea after RYGB. Late reoperations were required for 7 and 1 patients after RYGB and TB. Comorbidity improvement was similar. CONCLUSION In a superobese population, TB appeared relatively safer compared with RYGB. It achieved a better weight loss at 2 years with a trend for more digestive side effects.","Topart, Philippe; Becouarn, Guillaume; Finel, Jean-Baptiste",Obesity surgery,188,29

We sought to evaluate the incidence and etiology of ICH in patients with COVID-19 requiring ECMO. Patients at two academic medical centers with COVID-19 who required venovenous-ECMO support for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) were evaluated retrospectively. During the study period, 33 patients required ECMO support; 16 (48.5%) were discharged alive, 13 died (39.4%), and 4 (12.1%) had ongoing care. Eleven patients had ICH (33.3%). All ICH events occurred in patients who received intravenous anticoagulation. The ICH group had higher C-reactive protein (p = 0.04), and procalcitonin levels (p = 0.02), and IL-6 levels (p = 0.05), lower blood pH before and after ECMO (p < 0.01), and higher activated partial thromboplastin times throughout the hospital stay (p < 0.0001). ICH-free survival was lower in COVID-19 patients than in patients on ECMO for ARDS caused by other viruses (49% vs 79%, p = 0.02). In conclusion, patients with COVID-19 can be successfully bridged to recovery using ECMO but may suffer higher rates of ICH compared to those with other viral respiratory infections.","Bermea, Rene S; Raz, Yuval; Sertic, Federico; Rubin, Jonah; Wolf, Molly; Olia, Salim; Richards, Thomas; Crowley, Jerome; Funamoto, Masaki; Shelton, Kenneth; Bermudez, Christian",Shock,188,2

This cross-sectional study evaluated 16,202 oral health services, regarding 22 pieces of dental equipment and 25 dental supplies. The presence of each piece of equipment/dental supply generated a score for services. The sum of these scores was compared among different regions in Brazil. Quantitative data were described by quartiles and categorical data by frequencies, using the SPSS, version 25. Most of the evaluated centers presented adequate equipment in good using conditions and sufficient dental supplies for primary oral health care. Data also showed a lack of some equipment, such as X-rays, bicarbonate jet, and ultrasound devices, while for dental supplies, a lack of amalgam (capsule and manual preparation), anesthesia without vasoconstrictors, and intracanal medication was found. The services presented a median of 14 pieces of equipment and 22 dental supplies. Of the Brazilian regions, the South presented the highest median, while the North and Northeast regions presented the lowest one. The oral health services presented dental offices with good availability of equipment and dental supplies to perform clinical activities.

However, a systematic evaluation of these policies has not been made. Here, 17 implemented policies from the Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker dataset employed in 90 countries from December 31, 2019, to August 31, 2020, were analyzed. A Poisson regression model was applied to analyze the relationship between policies and daily confirmed cases using a generalized estimating equations approach. A lag is a fixed time displacement in time series data. With that, lagging (0, 3, 7, 10, and 14 days) was also considered during the analysis since the effects of policies implemented on a given day may affect the number of confirmed cases several days after implementation. The countries were divided into three groups depending on the number of waves of the pandemic observed in each country. Through subgroup analysis, we showed that with and without lagging, contact tracing and containment policies were significant for countries with two waves, while closing, economic, and health policies were significant for countries with three waves. Wave-specific analysis for each wave showed that significant health, economic, and containment policies varied across waves of the pandemic. Emergency investment in healthcare was consistently significant among the three groups of countries, while the Stringency index was significant among all waves of the pandemic. These findings may help in making informed decisions regarding whether, which, or when these policies should be intensified or lifted.","Chung, Hye Won; Apio, Catherine; Goo, Taewan; Heo, Gyujin; Han, Kyulhee; Kim, Taehyun; Kim, Hakyong; Ko, Yeonghyeon; Lee, Doeun; Lim, Jisun; Lee, Seungyeoun; Park, Taesung",Scientific reports,188,28

Considering the important role of nurses in establishing social justice, identification of factors affecting nurses' participation in this area can contribute to the development of social justice. OBJECTIVE This study aimed to identify factors affecting nurses' participation in establishing social justice in the health system. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS The study was conducted using conventional qualitative content analysis approach. Purposive sampling was used to select 14 participants in 2019. The data were collected through semi-structured interviews and analyzed concurrently with data gathering. PARTICIPANTS AND RESEARCH CONTEXT In total, six faculty members, five nursing managers, and three clinical nurses from three different universities were interviewed. ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS The research was approved by the Ethics Committee of Urmia University of Medical Sciences in Iran. FINDINGS Four main themes were found, including inadequate professional authority, insufficient attention to social justice in the area of education, clinical concerns as barriers to professional presence in society, and reflection of personality traits in the profession. These are the main factors affecting nurses' participation in establishing social justice in the health system. DISCUSSION Authorities need to take effective steps to establish social justice through reforming the health system's policy-making and power-acquisition domains, promoting nurses' involvement in social factors in health issues, and adding professional values as a part of nursing curriculum. The clinical practice environment can also be helpful through providing quality, safe, and cost-effective services. In addition, fair and efficient recruitment process for new nurses can contribute to the establishment of social justice in the health system. CONCLUSION Macro-level managerial factors such as policy, education, and clinical environment, along with personal factors, play a significant role in the participation of nursing profession in establishing social justice.","Hosseinzadegan, Fariba; Jasemi, Madineh; Habibzadeh, Hosein",Nursing ethics,188,26

The South African Government imposed a ban on the sale of all tobacco and vaping products between 27 March and 17 August 2020, as part of the COVID-19 lockdown. OBJECTIVES To assess how cigarette smokers responded to the sales ban, to evaluate how the ban impacted the cigarette market in South Africa and to use the South African experience to inform endgame planning. METHODS Regular preban cigarette smokers completed an online questionnaire from 4 to 19 June 2020 (n=23 631), in which they reported on their prelockdown cigarette smoking patterns, quitting behaviour (if relevant) and smoking behaviour during the ban. RESULTS About 9% of prelockdown smokers in the sample successfully quit smoking. 93% of continuing smokers purchased cigarettes despite the sales ban. The average price of cigarettes increased by 250% relative to prelockdown prices. Most respondents purchased cigarettes through informal channels. CONCLUSIONS The demand-side preconditions for an effective sales ban were not in place in South Africa, making a sales ban inappropriate. The South African experience suggests that supply-side factors are also important in ensuring the success of a sales ban. These are: (1) the illicit market must be under control before implementing a sales ban; and (2) an effective sales ban needs to be synchronised with a ban on the manufacture, transport and distribution of cigarettes.","Filby, Samantha; van der Zee, Kirsten; van Walbeek, Corné",Tobacco control,188,8

The early application of a pelvic circumferential compression device (PCCD) in patients with suspected pelvic fracture has established itself as best practice. Ambulance services conduct corresponding performance measurement. Quality indicators (QIs) are ideally based on high-quality evidence clearly demonstrating that the desirable effects outweigh the undesirable effects. In the absence of high-quality evidence, best available evidence should be combined with expert consensus. OBJECTIVES The aim of the present study was to identify, appraise and summarize the best available evidence regarding PCCDs for the purpose of informing an expert panel tasked to evaluate the validity of the following QI: A patient with suspected pelvic fracture has a PCCD applied. METHODS A rapid review of four databases was conducted to identify relevant literature published up until 9 June 2020. Systematic reviews, experimental, quasi-experimental and observational analytic studies written in English were included. One author was responsible for study selection and quality appraisal. Data extraction using a priori extraction templates was verified by a second reviewer. Study details and key findings were summarized in tables. RESULTS A total of 13 studies were assessed to be eligible for inclusion in this rapid review. Of these, three were systematic reviews, one was a randomized clinical trial (crossover design), two were before-after studies, and seven were retrospective cohort studies. The systematic reviews included mostly observational studies and could therefore not be considered as high-level evidence. Overall, the identified evidence is of low quality and suggests that PCCD may provide temporary pelvic ring stabilization and haemorrhage control, although a potential for adverse effects exists. CONCLUSION Given the low quality of the best available evidence, this evidence would need to be combined with expert consensus to evaluate the validity of a related quality indicator before its implementation.","Pap, Robin; McKeown, Rachel; Lockwood, Craig; Stephenson, Matthew; Simpson, Paul","Scandinavian journal of trauma, resuscitation and emergency medicine",188,7

Even after half a century of accelerator-based experiments, clinical applications and flight research, these two topics remain both fascinating and baffling. Heavy-ion therapy is very expensive, and despite the clinical success it remains controversial. Research on late radiation morbidity in spaceflight led to a reduction in uncertainty, but also pointed to new risks previously underestimated, such as possible damage to the central nervous system.

A need for simple, inexpensive techniques to prevent PPH and provide treatment exists, particularly in cases where uterotonics cannot be accessed. Uterine massage is recommended as part of the routine active management of the third stage of labor. This study was conducted to determine the effectiveness of uterine massage after delivery of the placenta in reducing postpartum blood loss. Thus, a randomized controlled trial was conducted in Turkey between March 2018 and September 2018. A total of 176 pregnant women (88 in the control and 88 in the uterine massage groups) were randomly allocated to the two groups: one group receiving sustained uterine massage, while the other comprising the control group. The uterine massage group was administered transabdominal uterine massage, starting immediately after delivery of the placenta and continuing every 15 min for a duration of 2 h until the uterus hardened. The blood loss within 2 h of delivery was recorded. Level of significance was taken as p < 0.05, and the chi-square, t, and Mann-Whitney U tests as well as Spearman's correlation and linear regression were employed in the analysis of the data. The average amount blood loss within 2 h of the delivery was significantly higher in the control group than in the massage group (X = 170.49 ± 61.46 and X = 186.20 ± 47.59, p < 0.05). A statistically significant difference was present between the uterine massage and control groups in terms of hemoglobin, hematocrit, WBC, and RCB pre-delivery and pre-discharge (first 24 h) values and in the use of additional uterotonics and the amount of blood loss (p < 0.05).

We included all hrHPV+ CIN2 and CIN3+ cases (n = 183) age matched to 183 < CIN2 hrHPV+. Baseline specimens were HPV-genotyped and tested by S5-methylation, blinded to cytology, histology, and initial HPV results. We evaluated the test performance of pre-defined S5-classifier (cut-point 0.8) and a post-hoc classifier at a different cut-point (3.1). S5 sensitivity for CIN2+ was 82% (95%CI 76.4-87.5) and for CIN3+ 77.08% (95%CI 65.19-88.97).

In this regard, health websites are considered as a potential source of information for elderlies as well as their caregivers. Nevertheless, the credibility of these websites has not been identified yet. Thus, this study aimed to evaluate the credibility of the health websites on the most prevalent chronic diseases of the elderly. METHODS The terms ""Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease"", ""Alzheimer's"", ""Ischemic heart disease"", and ""Stroke"" were searched using the three popular search engines. A total of 216 unique websites were eligible for evaluation. The study was carried out using the HONcode of conduct. The chi-square test was carried out to determine the difference between conforming and nonconforming websites with HONcode principles and website categories. RESULTS The findings showed that half of the evaluated websites had fully considered the HONcode principles. Furthermore, there was a significant difference between websites category and compliance with HONcode principles (p value < .05). CONCLUSION Regarding the poor credibility of most prevalent elderly diseases' websites, the potential online health information users should be aware of the low credibility of such websites, which may seriously threaten their health. Furthermore, educating the elderly and their caregivers to evaluate the credibility of websites by the use of popular tools such as HONcode of conducts before utilizing their information seems to be necessary.","Valizadeh-Haghi, Saeideh; Rahmatizadeh, Shahabedin; Soleimaninejad, Ali; Mousavi Shirazi, Seyedeh Fatemeh; Mollaei, Parisa",BMC medical informatics and decision making,188,8

This study aims to inform clinical practice by 1) comparing and describing narrative retells in Swedish adolescents with and without ADHD, and 2) investigating the effects of picture support on narration in the two groups. Fifteen adolescents with ADHD and 31 with typical development (TD) participated. Two carefully matched narratives for retelling, one with and one without picture support were administered, transcribed, and analyzed regarding content and linguistic complexity (macro- and microlevel measures). The results showed that the ADHD group included less content than the TD group in both tasks, measured in fewer story grammar units and details. Both groups included more story grammar units in the task without picture support. The TD group had shorter retells with higher syntactic complexity in the task with picture support compared to the task without picture support. Compared to TD peers, retells without picture support from the ADHD group were significantly shorter and had a higher proportion of grammatical errors. These results show different strengths and weaknesses in the two groups and indicate that the narrative task without picture support, which places higher demands on EF, captured a linguistic vulnerability in the ADHD group. In conclusion, the choice of narrative task is important to consider in clinical practice to enable accurate descriptions of linguistic strengths and weaknesses in individuals with ADHD, and aid in differential diagnosis.","Bergman, Anna; Hallin, Anna Eva",Clinical linguistics & phonetics,188,31

OBJECTIVE To assess the association between CAD and the incidence of 30-day postoperative mortality and major adverse cardiac events (MACEs) in patients undergoing bariatric surgery. SETTINGS Multicenter cohort study. METHODS We used the 2017 MBSAQIP database to study patients undergoing bariatric surgery from accredited centers in the United States and Canada between Jan 1, 2017, and Dec 31, 2017. Multivariate logistic regression was used to determine whether established CAD was independently associated with 30-day mortality and MACE, a composite endpoint that included myocardial infarction and/or cardiac arrest. RESULTS We reviewed data from 167,819 patients from 832 centers. There were 4172 patients with diagnosed CAD, and 163,647 without it. At 30-day follow-up, the endpoints of mortality, cardiac arrest, myocardial infarction, and MACE occurred in 172 (.10%), 82 (.05%), 57 (.03%), and 135 (.08%) patients, respectively. The endpoints occurred more significantly in patients with CAD compared with patients without CAD; 22 (.53%) versus 150 (.09%) for mortality, 13 (.31%) versus 69 (.04%) for cardiac arrest, 17 (.41%) versus 40 (.02%) for myocardial infarction, and 28 (.67%) versus 107 (.07%) for MACE (P < .001 for all comparisons). CONCLUSIONS Postoperative mortality and MACE following bariatric surgery are higher in patients with CAD than those without; however, the absolute incidence is low (<1%). The decision to pursue bariatric surgery and/or preoperative cardiac testing in patients with CAD should include consideration of the overall incidence of adverse cardiac outcomes and the stability of CAD.","Ruzieh, Mohammed; Rogers, Ann M; Banerjee, Kalins; Soleymani, Taraneh; Zhan, Xiang; Foy, Andrew J; Peterson, Brandon R",Surgery for obesity and related diseases : official journal of the American Society for Bariatric Surgery,188,0

CASE REPORT A 96-year-old woman, diagnosed with Hinchey 3 diverticulitis after a computed tomography scan, was operated on with a single-access ""lavage"" to reduce surgical trauma and to avoid stoma. METHODS The procedure was performed under general anesthesia. Tracheal intubation, nasogastric tube, and urethral catheterization were mandatory. The patient was in a modified Lloyd-Davis position, with the table tilted in Trendelenburg position, left side up. Surgeons were on the right side. INSTRUMENTATION The procedure was performed using a surgical technique similar to standard laparoscopy with traditional laparoscopic instruments. SURGICAL STEPS: The surgical procedure involved single-incision laparoscopic surgery (Covidien, Mansfield, MA) insertion, small bowel dissection, abscess opening, and peritoneal washing. RESULTS The procedure was completed in 75 minutes with an estimated blood loss of 120 mL. The patient was kept in the intensive care unit for 1 day. She was on postoperative analgesia for 2 days and was discharged from the hospital on postoperative day 5.

This study evaluated midterm outcomes of BMSs vs CBE stents placed in the common iliac artery (CIA) for aortoiliac occlusive disease. METHODS All endovascular interventions for symptomatic peripheral arterial occlusive disease performed at a single institution from 2006 to 2012 were reviewed. Patients undergoing stent placement in the CIA segment were included in the analysis. Demographic data, TransAtlantic Inter-Society Consensus (TASC) classification, stent type, patency, and limb reinterventions were compared. RESULTS For treatment of de novo distal aorta or CIA stenosis, 254 procedures were performed in 162 patients. BMSs were used in 190 arteries; CBE stents were used in 64 arteries. There was no difference in age, gender, or TASC classification between the two groups. Mean follow-up was 22 ± 16 months. Primary patency, assisted patency, and secondary patency were significantly better in the BMS group. CIAs treated with covered stents were more likely at 1 year or longer to require repeated intervention (hazard ratio, 2.5; 95% confidence interval, 1.2-5.3; P = .009). TASC classification did not predict need for reintervention in either group. Multivariate analysis revealed dual antiplatelet therapy to be the only other factor to affect patency during long-term follow-up. CONCLUSIONS In this study, BMSs had significantly better patency compared with CBE stents for treatment of aortoiliac occlusive disease. A randomized trial comparing patency as well as restenosis rates with long-term follow-up is needed to determine if there is any benefit from use of covered stents in the aortoiliac segment.","Humphries, Misty D; Armstrong, Ehrin; Laird, John; Paz, Jessica; Pevec, William",Journal of vascular surgery,188,16

We determined whether airway pressure release ventilation (APRV) can be used to recruit the immature lungs of preterm pigs without injury. Spontaneously breathing pigs delivered at 89% of term (model for 28-wk infants) were randomized to 24 h of APRV (n = 9) vs. AC+VG with a tidal volume of 5 ml/kg (n = 10). Control pigs (n = 36) were provided with supplemental oxygen by an open mask. Nutrition and fluid support was provided throughout the 24-h period. All pigs supported with APRV and AC+VG survived 24 h, compared with 62% of control pigs. APRV resulted in improved lung volume recruitment compared with AC+VG based on radiographs, lower Pco2 levels (44 ± 2.9 vs. 53 ± 2.7 mmHg, P = 0.009) and lower inspired oxygen fraction requirements (36 ± 6 vs. 44 ± 11%, P < 0.001), and higher oxygenation index (5.1 ± 1.5 vs. 2.9 ± 1.1, P = 0.001). There were no differences between APRV and AC+VG pigs for heart rate, ratio of wet to dry lung mass, proinflammatory cytokines, or histopathological markers of lung injury. Lung protective ventilation with APRV improved recruitment of alveoli of preterm lungs, enhanced development and maintenance of functional residual capacity without injury, and improved clinical outcomes relative to AC+VG. Long-term consequences of lung volume recruitment by using APRV should be evaluated.","Arrindell, Esmond L; Krishnan, Ramesh; van der Merwe, Marie; Caminita, Frank; Howard, Scott C; Zhang, Jie; Buddington, Randal K",American journal of physiology.

We use data from a nationally representative U.S. sample from one of the Multimedia Audience Research Systems (MARS) data sets collected by Kantar Media. Our results demonstrate the crucial role of doctor-patient communication in building patients' trust in doctors, which in turn positively impact vaccination attitudes and H1N1 vaccination behavior. Unlike other preventive health measures, getting vaccines after a pandemic is a critical decision because these vaccines are previously unknown. Our finding implies that verified communication from the physician's office may be one of the effective strategies during or after a pandemic. Our findings have implications for public health organizations to incorporate effective vaccination communication and could have critical implications for the COVID-19 vaccination.","Borah, Porismita; Hwang, Juwon",Health communication,188,16

We assessed whether COVID-19 worry was related to indicators of mental health and preparedness for future care, in an adult lifespan sample. METHOD An online study (n = 485; age 18-82, M = 49.31, SD = 15.39) included measures of COVID-19 worry, depression, general anxiety, health anxiety, hostile and benevolent ageism, preparedness for future care, and demographic information. RESULTS Age and living alone were positively associated with greater COVID-19 worry, as were health anxiety, general anxiety, benevolent ageism, and preparedness for future care needs via gathering information. A significant interaction indicated that among individuals reporting lower health anxiety, greater preference for gathering information was positively associated with greater COVID-19 worry; however, for individuals having high health anxiety, gathering information about future care was not related to COVID-19 worry, as their COVID-19 worry levels were moderately high. CONCLUSION Older age was associated with greater COVID-19 worry, perhaps in response to the much publicized greater risk for negative outcomes in this population. In spite of this specific concern, indicators of older adults' continued mental health emerged. Preparedness for future care is also highlighted, as well as clinical implications.","Maxfield, Molly; Pituch, Keenan A",Aging & mental health,188,1

The heterostructures were employed as catalysts for the removal of two pharmaceuticals, acetaminophen (ACE) and antipyrine (ANT), by heterogeneous Fenton and photo-Fenton processes. ACE removal under different operation conditions was studied in detail to establish structure-performance relationships, being the TiO2 formation and the developed texture the main factors controlling the activity. ANT showed a higher refractory behavior in oxidation by Fenton. Among the technologies studied, heterogeneous photo-Fenton achieved the best catalytic performance and higher kinetic rate and mineralization degree. Iron leaching was very low, lower than 5% of the initial iron load in all cases.

Obtaining stably attenuated vaccine strains has traditionally been an empirical process, which greatly restricts the number of effective vaccines for viral diseases. Here we describe a rational approach for engineering stably attenuated viruses that can serve as safe and effective vaccines. Our approach exploits the observation that restricting viral population diversity by increasing replication fidelity greatly reduces viral tissue tropism and pathogenicity. We show that poliovirus variants with reduced genetic diversity elicit a protective immune response in an animal model of infection. Indeed, these novel vaccine candidates are comparable in efficacy to the currently available Sabin type 1 vaccine strain, but have the added advantage of being more stable, as their increased replication fidelity prevents reversion to the pathogenic wild-type phenotype. We propose that restricting viral quasispecies diversity provides a general approach for the rational design of stable, attenuated vaccines for a wide variety of viruses.","Vignuzzi, Marco; Wendt, Emily; Andino, Raul",Nature medicine,188,12

In an attempt to contain the disease, health authorities call for self-quarantine of individuals suspected as exposures. Health officials assume the public will comply in high rates; however, studies suggest that a major obstacle to compliance for household quarantine is concern over loss of income. A cross sectional study of the adult population of Israel was conducted in the last week of February 2020 to assess public attitudes toward the COVID-19 outbreak. In particular, public compliance rates with self-quarantine were assessed depending on compensation for lost wages. The results suggest that when compensation was assumed, the compliance rate was 94%; yet, when compensation was removed, the compliance rate dropped to less than 57%.

This experimental study examines the potential of minimally invasive pneumoperitoneal-MRI to assess these adhesions in a preclinical context. METHODS Uncoated polyethylene terephthalate meshes were placed intraperitoneally in rats, in regard to the caecum previously scraped to promote petechial bleeding and subsequent adhesions. Examinations were performed 2-weeks post mesh implantation using a rodent dedicated high field MRI. Respiratory-triggered T2-weighted images were acquired prior to and after intraperitoneal injection of ~8-10 mL gas to induce a mechanical stress on the abdominal wall. RESULTS Adhesions are occasionally seen in sham-operated rats as opposed to rats receiving polyethylene terephthalate meshes. On high-resolution images, meshes can be detected due to their characteristic net shape. However, evidence of adherence is only found if intraperitoneal gas injection is performed, when a ~1-cm elevation of the abdominal wall is observed. When adherence occurs between the mesh and the caecum, the latter remains in contact with the wall. Looser adherences between visceral tissue and meshes are also observed. CONCLUSIONS T2-weighted pneumoperitoneal-MRI is a powerful tool for assessing adherence after intraperitoneal mesh implantation. According to the mini-invasive procedure adopted here, this approach may allow a temporal follow-up of adherence fate.","Franconi, Florence; Roux, Jérome; Lefebvre-Lacoeuille, Céline; Lemaire, Laurent",Surgical endoscopy,188,4

This qualitative study aimed to define and characterize higher-order cognitive competencies required to safely perform a laparoscopic cholecystectomy. STUDY DESIGN Hierarchical and cognitive task analyses for establishing a critical view of safety during laparoscopic cholecystectomy were performed using qualitative methods to map the thoughts and practices that characterize expert performance. Experts with more than 5 years of experience, and who have performed at least 100 laparoscopic cholecystectomies, participated in semi-structured interviews and field observations. Verbal data were transcribed verbatim, supplemented with content from published literature, coded, thematically analyzed using grounded-theory by 2 independent reviewers, and synthesized into a list of items. RESULTS A conceptual framework was created based on 10 interviews with experts, 9 procedures, and 18 literary sources. Experts included 6 minimally invasive surgeons, 2 hepato-pancreatico-biliary surgeons, and 2 acute care general surgeons (median years in practice, 11 [range 8 to 14]). One hundred eight cognitive elements (35 [32%] related to situation awareness, 47 [44%] involving decision-making, and 26 [24%] action-oriented subtasks) and 75 potential errors were identified and categorized into 6 general themes and 14 procedural tasks. Of the 75 potential errors, root causes were mapped to errors in situation awareness (24 [32%]), decision-making (49 [65%]), or either one (61 [81%]).

However, it remains unknown whether epigenetic mechanisms are involved in these processes. The possible epigenetic mechanisms involved in IL-6 expression during influenza virus (IV) infection were investigated in this study. Our results showed that both IV and its replicative intermediate dsRNA activated the IL-6 promoter, increased its transcription and enhanced cytokine secretion. IL-6 was up-regulated by DNA methyltransferase inhibitor 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (DAC) treatment, while its promoter activity was decreased when promoter DNA was methylated in vitro. Further study found that the IL-6 proximal promoter region was demethylated after both IV infection and dsRNA treatment, subsequently impairing its binding by transcription factors. Moreover, the DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) activity was inhibited in dsRNA treated nuclei, and DNMT1 but not DNMT3a or DNMT3b was responsible for IL-6 expression in this process. These results implied that IL-6 expression was regulated by promoter demethylation induced by down-regulation of DNMT activity. Our work revealed that epigenetic mechanisms regulate host genes expression in IV infection, and provided a new insight into understanding the mechanisms of viral infection.","Tang, Bikui; Zhao, Ruihua; Sun, Yong; Zhu, Ying; Zhong, Jiang; Zhao, Guoping; Zhu, Naishuo",Molecular immunology,188,25

Therefore, this study compared the surgical outcomes between monopolar endo-hook versus endo-shears during laparoscopic right hemicolectomy for right colon cancer. METHODS Using a prospective database of patients treated at our institute, we analyzed the surgical outcomes of 358 consecutive patients with right colon cancer who underwent curative laparoscopic surgery with a monopolar endo-hook (n = 164) or endo-shears (n = 194) between March 2009 and March 2017. RESULTS There were no differences in age, sex, body mass index, American Society of Anesthesiologists' grade, previous operative history, or clinical stage between the endo-hook and endo-shears groups. The estimated blood loss was similar between the endo-hook and endo-shears groups (90.9 ± 60.3 vs. 92.0 ± 89.3 mL; P = 0.893). The number of harvested lymph nodes was greater in the endo-hook group (53.5 ± 20.3 vs. 48.1 ± 18.5; P = 0.008). Hospital stay was shorter in the endo-hook group (6.8 ± 2.2 vs. 7.8 ± 4.8 days; P = 0.013). Although chylous ascites was more frequent in the endo-hook group (21.3% vs. 7.7%, P < 0.001), the postoperative morbidity rate was lower in this group (9.8% vs. 18.0%; P = 0.025). All instances of chylous ascites healed spontaneously without intervention. CONCLUSIONS This study showed that the use of a monopolar endo-hook during laparoscopic right hemicolectomy might permit more meticulous lymph-node dissection and reduce morbidity compared with the use of monopolar endo-shears.

Inadequate, excessive GWG or weight loss during pregnancy is associated with an increased risk of negative maternal and fetal outcomes. Among the many determinants of GWG identified in the 2009 Institute of Medicine guidelines, culture was named as one of the few whose influence has not been fully explored. Some cultural beliefs may erroneously promote overeating as ""eating for two"" and discourage physical activity during pregnancy, but there is lack of empirical evidence on how culture affects GWG. The purpose of this systematic review is to examine the effects of culture on GWG. METHODS/DESIGN Ten electronic databases will be searched to identify studies reporting on the effects of culture on GWG. Grey literature, published conference abstracts, websites of relevant organizations and reference lists of included studies will also be searched. Studies that report on effects of culture, acculturation, ethnicity, race, nationality, ancestry and identity on GWG in adult women will be included. Quality of evidence will be evaluated using the grading of recommendations, assessment, development and evaluations (GRADE) approach to rating evidence. Study selection, data extraction and risk of bias assessment will be conducted by two independent reviewers, with disagreements being resolved by consensus or third party adjudication as needed. Formal meta-analyses will be conducted among included studies that are sufficiently statistically and clinically homogeneous. DISCUSSION This review will provide a comprehensive assessment and synthesis of current evidence and will draw attention to potential gaps where future research on the effects of culture on guideline discordant gestational weight gain remains to be conducted.

Remdesivir is the first antiviral compound approved by the US FDA for the SARS-CoV-2 treatment for emergency use, targeting RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) enzyme. In this work, we have examined the action of remdesivir and other two ligands screened from the library of nucleotide analogues using docking and molecular dynamics (MD) simulation studies. The MD simulations have been performed for all the ligand-bound RdRp complexes for the 30 ns time scale. This is one of the earlier reports to perform the MD simulations studies using the SARS-CoV-2 RdRp crystal structure (PDB ID 7BTF). The MD trajectories were analyzed and Molecular Mechanics Poisson-Boltzmann Surface Area (MM-PBSA) calculations were performed to calculate the binding free energy. The binding energy data reveal that compound-17 (-59.6 kcal/mol) binds more strongly as compared to compound-8 (-46.3 kcal/mol) and remdesivir (-29.7 kcal/mol) with RdRp. The detailed analysis of trajectories shows that the remdesivir binds in the catalytic site and forms a hydrogen bond with the catalytic residues from 0 to 0.46 ns. Compound-8 binds in the catalytic site but does not form direct hydrogen bonds with catalytic residues. Compound-17 showed the formation of hydrogen bonds with catalytic residues throughout the simulation process. The MD simulation results such as hydrogen bonding, the center of mass distance analysis, snapshots at a different time interval, and binding energy suggest that compound-17 binds strongly with RdRp of SARS-CoV-2 and has the potential to develop as a new antiviral against COVID-19. Further, the frontier molecular orbital analysis and molecular electrostatic potential (MESP) iso-surface analysis using DFT calculations shed light on the superior binding of compound-17 with RdRp compared to remdesivir and compound-8. The computed as well as the experimentally reported pharmacokinetics and toxicity parameters of compound-17 is encouraging and therefore can be one of the potential candidates for the treatment of COVID-19.","Wakchaure, Padmaja D; Ghosh, Shibaji; Ganguly, Bishwajit",The journal of physical chemistry.

We used honey bees, Apis mellifera, and combined olfactory conditioning and pheromone preexposure with disruption of neural activity and two-photon imaging of olfactory brain circuits, to characterize the effect of pheromones on olfactory learning and memory. Geraniol, an attractive pheromone component, and 2-heptanone, an aversive pheromone, improved and impaired, respectively, olfactory learning and memory via a durable modulation of appetitive motivation, which left odor processing unaffected. Consistently, interfering with aminergic circuits mediating appetitive motivation rescued or diminished the cognitive effects induced by pheromone components. We thus show that these chemical messengers act as important modulators of motivational processes and influence thereby animal cognition.","Baracchi, David; Cabirol, Amélie; Devaud, Jean-Marc; Haase, Albrecht; d'Ettorre, Patrizia; Giurfa, Martin",Communications biology,188,16

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the frequency and the clinical relevance of procedure-related complications in mechanical thrombectomy. METHODS We conducted a retrospective analysis of 176 consecutive acute ischemic stroke cases that were treated with mechanical thrombectomy. Primary outcome measures included the following: symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (sICH), vessel dissection, emboli to new vascular territories, vasospasm, and stent dislocation/occlusion whenever appropriate. Secondary outcome measures included mTICI score, time from symptom onset to revascularization, and time from groin puncture to revascularization as well as the early clinical outcome at discharge. RESULTS Complications occurred in 20/176 patients (11 %) comprising 23 adverse events at the following rates: sICH 8/176 (5 %), emboli to new vascular territories 4/176 (2 %); vessel dissection 3/176 (2 %); vasospasm of the access vessel 5/176 (3 %); stent dislocation in 1/42 (2 %); and stent occlusion in 2/42 (5 %). Two out of 20 (10 %) suffered from two or more procedure-related complications. There was a statistically significant correlation of complications with time from groin puncture to revascularization, unfavorable revascularization results, and unfavorable clinical outcome. CONCLUSION Overall, the frequency of procedure-related complications lies within acceptable limits for an emergency procedure. The endovascular treatment does not seem to add significantly to the stroke patients' risk of sICH but implies an innate risk of stroke in an initially uninvolved territory. Furthermore, a prolonged endovascular procedure beyond an hour is correlated with higher complication rates, which underlines the importance of a swift and complete revascularization.","Behme, Daniel; Gondecki, Ludger; Fiethen, Sarah; Kowoll, Annika; Mpotsaris, Anastasios; Weber, Werner",Neuroradiology,188,1

We also examined the association of the degree of pes planovalgus with muscle mass of the ankle joint and foot muscles in children with DS and children with TD. The subjects were 24 children with TD (control [CTR] group) and 23 children with DS (DS group). To assess pes planovalgus, the Arch Height Index (AHI) in the standing position was measured. Muscle thickness of the ankle joint and foot muscles was measured using an ultrasound imaging device. The AHI and thickness of the soleus and tibialis posterior muscles were significantly lower in the DS group than those in the CTR group. The thickness of the flexor digitorum longus muscle was significantly greater in the DS group than that in the CTR group. Stepwise regression analysis revealed that the thickness of the flexor digitorum longus muscle was a significant and independent factor of the AHI in children comprising the CTR and DS groups. The thickness of the flexor digitorum longus muscle increased with decreasing AHI. The results of this study suggest that the AHI and muscle mass of the soleus and tibialis posterior muscles decrease, while muscle mass of the flexor digitorum longus muscle increases in children with DS. The results also indicate that decreased AHI is associated with increased muscle mass of the flexor digitorum longus muscle in children.","Masaki, Mitsuhiro; Sugawara, Karin; Iizuka, Yuka; Uchikawa, Yuki; Isobe, Honoka; Hattori, Fuyumi; Mano, Koki; Saito, Keiko; Sugino, Ayaka; Kato, Kana; Sakaino, Kenji",Journal of biomechanics,188,32

RESULTS In all 176 patients, preoperative platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR) was not found to be a predictor of overall survival (OS). However, in patients without antiplatelet or anticoagulant therapies, PLR was significantly associated with a poor OS (p=0.03). Although platelet large cell ratio (P-LCR) was not associated with the prognosis in patients with antiplatelet and/or anticoagulant therapies, higher P-LCR was associated with a poor prognosis in patients without antiplatelet or anticoagulant therapies (p<0.0001).

METHODS Eighty cases of COVID-19 diagnosed from January 24 to February 17, 2020 in Beijing YouAn Hospital Affiliated to Capital Medical University were retrospectively analyzed. All 80 patients received symptomatic and supportive treatment. Among them, 44 patients took Jinhua Qinggan granules (treatment group) within 24 h of admission, and the remaining 36 patients either did not take Jinhua Qinggan granules or took the granules for less than 2 d (control group). In this study, we compared the duration of viral nucleic acid detection and of pneumonia absorption improvement between the two groups. RESULTS Among the 80 cases, 37 were male (46%) and 43 were female (54%) with age ranging from 15 to 86 years, with an average age of 51.19 years. The average duration of viral nucleic acid detection was (7 ± 4) d in the Jinhua Qinggan administration group and (10 ± 4) d for the control group (P = 0.010), following which, nucleic acid tests were negative. Of the two groups, 56.82% in the Jinhua Qinggan treatment group and 27.78% in the control group demonstrated negative nucleic acid tests within 7 d or less. The 7-day viral clearance rate was significantly higher in the Jinhua Qinggan group compared with the control group (P = 0.009). Furthermore, the pneumonia recovery time indicated by chest CT was (8 ± 4) d in the Jinhua Qinggan group, which was significantly shorter than the control group, at (10 ± 5) d (P = 0.021). No adverse reactions were found in the treatment group after taking this medicine. CONCLUSION In patients with COVID-19, Jinhua Qinggan granules can effectively shorten the duration of nucleic acid detection and promote the absorption of pneumonia inflammatory exudate without obvious adverse reactions.","Liu, Zengli; Li, Xiuhui; Gou, Chunyan; Li, Li; Luo, Xiaolan; Zhang, Chun; Zhang, Yin; Zhang, Jiaying; Jin, Aihua; Li, Hongyan; Zeng, Yuan; Li, Tongzeng; Wang, Xiaoju",Journal of traditional Chinese medicine = Chung i tsa chih ying wen pan,188,11

In order to minimize energy consumption during this potentially prolonged state, quiescent bacteria substantially attenuate protein synthesis, the most energetically costly cellular process. Ribosomes in quiescent bacteria are present as dimers of two 70S ribosomes. Dimerization is dependent on a single protein, hibernation promoting factor (HPF), that binds the ribosome in the mRNA channel. This interaction indicates that dimers are inactive, suggesting that HPF inhibits translation. However, we observe that HPF does not significantly affect protein synthesis in vivo suggesting that dimerization is a consequence of inactivity, not the cause. The HPF-dimer interaction further implies that re-initiation of translation when the bacteria exit quiescence requires dimer resolution. We show that ribosome dimers quickly resolve in the presence of nutrients, and this resolution is dependent on transcription, indicating that mRNA synthesis is required for dimer resolution. Finally, we observe that ectopic HPF expression in growing cells where mRNA is abundant does not significantly affect protein synthesis despite stimulating dimer formation, suggesting that dimerization is dynamic. Thus, the extensive transcription that occurs in response to nutrient availability rapidly re-activates the translational apparatus of a quiescent cell and induces dimer resolution.","Feaga, Heather A; Dworkin, Jonathan",Molecular microbiology,188,31

However, the effectiveness of specific strategies has never been systematically reviewed. We analyze published evidence on strategies to optimize the management and allocation of scarce resources across a wide range of mass casualty event contexts and study designs. METHODS Our literature search included MEDLINE, Scopus, EMBASE, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, Global Health, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, from 1990 through late 2011. We also searched the gray literature, using the New York Academy of Medicine's Grey Literature Report and key Web sites. We included both English- and foreign-language articles. We included studies that evaluated strategies used in actual mass casualty events or tested through drills, exercises, or computer simulations. We excluded studies that lacked a comparison group or did not report quantitative outcomes. Data extraction, quality assessment, and strength of evidence ratings were conducted by a single researcher and reviewed by a second; discrepancies were reconciled by the 2 reviewers. Because of heterogeneity in outcome measures, we qualitatively synthesized findings within categories of strategies. RESULTS From 5,716 potentially relevant citations, 74 studies met inclusion criteria. Strategies included reducing demand for health care services (18 studies), optimizing use of existing resources (50), augmenting existing resources (5), implementing crisis standards of care (5), and multiple categories (4). The evidence was sufficient to form conclusions on 2 strategies, although the strength of evidence was rated as low. First, as a strategy to reduce demand for health care services, points of dispensing can be used to efficiently distribute biological countermeasures after a bioterrorism attack or influenza pandemic, and their organization influences speed of distribution. Second, as a strategy to optimize use of existing resources, commonly used field triage systems do not perform consistently during actual mass casualty events. The number of high-quality studies addressing other strategies was insufficient to support conclusions about their effectiveness because of differences in study context, comparison groups, and outcome measures. Our literature search may have missed key resource management and allocation strategies because of their extreme heterogeneity. Interrater reliability was not assessed for quality assessments or strength of evidence ratings. Publication bias is likely, given the large number of studies reporting positive findings. CONCLUSION The current evidence base is inadequate to inform providers and policymakers about the most effective strategies for managing or allocating scarce resources during mass casualty events. Consensus on methodological standards that encompass a range of study designs is needed to guide future research and strengthen the evidence base. Evidentiary standards should be developed to promote consensus interpretations of the evidence supporting individual strategies.","Timbie, Justin W; Ringel, Jeanne S; Fox, D Steven; Pillemer, Francesca; Waxman, Daniel A; Moore, Melinda; Hansen, Cynthia K; Knebel, Ann R; Ricciardi, Richard; Kellermann, Arthur L",Annals of emergency medicine,188,16

The most common dressings in use, both regionally and worldwide, are calcium alginates. We will compare an alginate with two other dressings, all of which are in current use in the Pegg Leditschke Paediatric Burns Centre (PLPBC), to determine which dressing performs the best. METHODS/DESIGN This is a randomised, prospective single center parallel three-arm trial comparing three donor site wound (DSW) dressings: Algisite™ M, a calcium alginate dressing; Cuticerin™, a smooth acetate gauze impregnated with water-repellent ointment (petrolatum, paraffin and Eucerite®) and Sorbact®, a gauze mesh coated with a dialkylcarbamoyl chloride (DACC) and amorphous hydrogel. Primary outcomes are days to complete DSW healing, and pain. Previously validated measures will be used for all outcomes. Secondary outcomes are: itch; scar appearance at three, six and 12 months; ease of dressing application and removal and dressing costs and utility. Results will be analysed on an intention-to-treat basis. Donor site thickness will be measured with a small biopsy from the center of the graft, to document the depth of the DSW across the groups. DISCUSSION This study will provide comprehensive short- and long-term data on DSW dressings in pediatric split-thickness skin grafting. The best-performing dressing will become the preferred dressing for the PLPBC.

CCFIS improved significantly from 12·7(3·3) to 4·1(3·0), 3·9(2·6) and 5·1(3·0) respectively (P < 0·001), and Vaizey score from 15·4(3·3) to 7·1(3·9), 4·7(3·0) and 6·9(5·0) respectively (P = 0·010). Soiling and ability to postpone defaecation improved significantly, and patients reported significant improvement in health status and quality of life. At follow-up, manometric parameters had not changed and EUS did not demonstrate any prosthesis dislocation. CONCLUSION The Gatekeeper(™) anal implant seemed safe, reliable and effective. Initial clinical improvement was maintained over time, and follow-up data were encouraging.","Ratto, C; Parello, A; Donisi, L; Litta, F; De Simone, V; Spazzafumo, L; Giordano, P",The British journal of surgery,188,16

These small conglomerations can influence environmental calcium levels and have the potential to modulate calcium homeostasis in vivo. Nanoparticles have been associated with various calcium-mediated disease processes, such as atherosclerosis and kidney stone formation. We hypothesized that nanoparticles could have an effect on other calcium-regulated processes, such as wound healing. In the present study, we synthesized pH-sensitive calcium-based nanoparticles and investigated their ability to enhance cutaneous wound repair. METHODS Different populations of nanoparticles were synthesized on collagen-coated plates under various growth conditions. Bilateral dorsal cutaneous wounds were made on 8-week-old female Balb/c mice. Nanoparticles were then either administered intravenously or applied topically to the wound bed. The rate of wound closure was quantified. Intravenously injected nanoparticles were tracked using a FLAG detection system. The effect of nanoparticles on fibroblast contraction and proliferation was assessed. RESULTS A population of pH-sensitive calcium-based nanoparticles was identified. When intravenously administered, these nanoparticles acutely increased the rate of wound healing. Intravenously administered nanoparticles were localized to the wound site, as evidenced by FLAG staining. Nanoparticles increased fibroblast calcium uptake in vitro and caused contracture of a fibroblast populated collagen lattice in a dose-dependent manner. Nanoparticles also increased the rate of fibroblast proliferation. CONCLUSION Intravenously administered, calcium-based nanoparticles can acutely decrease open wound size via contracture. We hypothesize that their contraction effect is mediated by the release of ionized calcium into the wound bed, which occurs when the pH-sensitive nanoparticles disintegrate in the acidic wound microenvironment. This is the first study to demonstrate that calcium-based nanoparticles can have a therapeutic benefit, which has important implications for the treatment of wounds.","Kawai, Kenichiro; Larson, Barrett J; Ishise, Hisako; Carre, Antoine Lyonel; Nishimoto, Soh; Longaker, Michael; Lorenz, H Peter",PloS one,188,27

In the context of conflict settings, population displacement, disrupted treatment, infrastructure damage and other factors impose serious NCD intervention delivery challenges, but relatively little attention has been paid to addressing these challenges. Here we synthesise the available indexed and grey literature reporting on the delivery of NCD interventions to conflict-affected women and children in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). METHODS A systematic search in MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL and PsycINFO databases for indexed articles published between 1 January 1990 and 31 March 2018 was conducted, and publications reporting on NCD intervention delivery to conflict-affected women or children in LMICs were included. A grey literature search of 10 major humanitarian organisation websites for publications dated between 1 January 2013 and 30 November 2018 was also conducted. We extracted and synthesised information on intervention delivery characteristics and delivery barriers and facilitators. RESULTS Of 27 included publications, most reported on observational research studies, half reported on studies in the Middle East and North Africa region and 80% reported on interventions targeted to refugees. Screening and medication for cardiovascular disease and diabetes were the most commonly reported interventions, with most publications reporting facility-based delivery and very few reporting outreach or community approaches. Doctors were the most frequently reported delivery personnel. No publications reported on intervention coverage or on the effectiveness of interventions among women or children. Limited population access and logistical constraints were key delivery barriers reported, while innovative technology use, training of workforce and multidisciplinary care were reported to have facilitated NCD intervention delivery. CONCLUSION Large and persistent gaps in information and evidence make it difficult to recommend effective strategies for improving the reach of quality NCD care among conflict-affected women and children. More rigorous research and reporting on effective strategies for delivering NCD care in conflict contexts is urgently needed.

METHODS We prospectively randomized 30 patients to receive TURP or original PAE (oPAE) and compared them to a cohort of patients treated by PErFecTED PAE, with a minimum of 1-year follow-up. Patients were assessed for urodynamic parameters, prostate volume, international prostate symptom score (IPSS), and quality of life (QoL). RESULTS All groups were comparable for all pre-treatment parameters except bladder contractility and peak urine flow rate (Q max), both of which were significantly better in the TURP group, and IIEF score, which was significantly higher among PErFecTED PAE patients than TURP patients. All groups experienced significant improvement in IPSS, QoL, prostate volume, and Q max. TURP and PErFecTED PAE both resulted in significantly lower IPSS than oPAE but were not significantly different from one another. TURP resulted in significantly higher Q max and significantly smaller prostate volume than either original or PErFecTED PAE but required spinal anesthesia and hospitalization. Two patients in the oPAE group with hypocontractile bladders experienced recurrence of symptoms and were treated with TURP. In the TURP group, urinary incontinence occurred in 4/15 patients (26.7 %), rupture of the prostatic capsule in 1/15 (6.7 %), retrograde ejaculation in all patients (100 %), and one patient was readmitted for temporary bladder irrigation due to hematuria. CONCLUSIONS TURP and PAE are both safe and effective treatments. TURP and PErFecTED PAE yield similar symptom improvement, but TURP is associated with both better urodynamic results and more adverse events.","Carnevale, Francisco C; Iscaife, Alexandre; Yoshinaga, Eduardo M; Moreira, Airton Mota; Antunes, Alberto A; Srougi, Miguel",Cardiovascular and interventional radiology,188,1

PATIENTS AND METHODS We reviewed the medical records of 165 children who had a nasal wash culture positive for PIV at our institution between 1998 and 2008. Nasal wash samples were assayed for 26 inflammatory mediators using Luminex bead proteomics. RESULTS A total of 153 patients, ages 2 weeks to 12 years, with single virus infection were included in our final analysis. Fifty-two patients were infected with PIV1, 19 with PIV2, 74 with PIV3, and 8 with PIV4. Lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) was diagnosed in 67 (44%) patients, 21 (14%) had laryngotracheobronchitis, and 49 (32%) had an upper respiratory infection other than laryngotracheobronchitis. LRTI was diagnosed in 54% of patients infected with PIV3, 35% of those infected with PIV1, 26% of those with PIV2, and 50% of those with PIV4. Compared with uninfected control patients, PIV-infected patients had higher nasal wash concentrations of interleukin-6, CX-chemokine ligand 8 (CXCL8 or interleukin-8), CCL3 (macrophage inflammatory protein-1alpha), CCL4 (macrophage inflammatory protein-1beta), CXCL9 (monokine induced by interferon gamma), and CCL5 (regulated upon activation, normal T cell expressed and secreted (RANTES). Patients with LRTI, moderate or severe illness, and PIV 1 or 3 (respirovirus) infection had higher nasal wash concentrations of CXCL8 when compared with patients with upper respiratory infection, mild illness, or PIV 2 and 4 (rubulavirus) infection (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS PIV infection causes a spectrum of illnesses associated with the expression and release of several proinflammatory mediators. Of note, elevated concentrations of CXCL8 in nasal wash samples are associated with more severe forms of PIV disease.","El Feghaly, Rana E; McGann, Lindsay; Bonville, Cynthia A; Branigan, Patrick J; Suryadevera, Manika; Rosenberg, Helene F; Domachowske, Joseph B",The Pediatric infectious disease journal,188,16

Notably, coix seed is currently being used as a traditional medicine for the treatment of COVID-19 in China. However, coix seeds are generally contaminated by mycotoxins, and this risk cannot be ignored. In this paper, we developed a method that involves direct extraction and UHPLC-HRMS analysis for the simultaneous detection of 24 mycotoxins in coix seeds. UHPLC-HRMS instrument and data acquisition parameters, and the sample pretreatment were optimised. One-step extraction showed several advantages compared to the three commercial solid-phase extraction clean-up methods, including ease of use, reduced time of sample preparation, low cost, good recovery, and acceptable matrix effect. The method validation results indicate that all mycotoxins have good linearity and sensitivity. Recoveries were between 74.2-101.1%, and RSD ranged from 0.1-5.8%. The LOQs for 24 mycotoxins were in the range of 0.5-100 µg/kg. To survey the contamination levels of these mycotoxins in commercial coix seeds, more than 70 samples were collected from Chinese markets and were analysed using the newly developed method. Zearalenone (positive ratio: 98.7%, range:1.1-1562 µg/kg), deoxynivalenol (positive ratio: 87%, range: 8.4-382.5 µg/kg), nivalenol (positive ratio: 85.7%, range: 26.8-828.2 µg/kg), fumonisin B1 (positive ratio: 84.4%, range:2.5-314.5 µg/kg), fumonisin B2 (positive ratio: 75.3%, range:1.6-72.8 µg/kg), fumonisin B3 (positive ratio: 48%, range:1.0-203.6 µg/kg), aflatoxin B1 (positive ratio: 29.9%, range: 0.39-14.7 µg/kg), sterigmatocystin (positive ratio: 29.9%, range: 1.4-51.6 µg/kg), and tenuazonic acid (positive ratio: 19.5%, range 36.1-105.7 µg/kg) were the most frequent mycotoxin contaminants.

METHOD Hospital files of patients hospitalized with a diagnosis of critical COVID-19 pneumonia between November 2020 and March 2021 were retrospectively reviewed. Chest computed tomography images taken both before treatment and 2 months after treatment, demographic characteristics and laboratory parameters of patients receiving pirfenidone+methylprednisolone (n=13) and only methylprednisolones (n=9) were recorded. Pulmonary function tests were performed after the second month of the treatment. CT involvement rates were determined by machine learning. RESULTS A total of 22 patients, 13 of whom (59.1%) were using methylprednisolone + pirfenidone and 9 of whom (40.9%) were using only methylprednisolone were included. When the blood gas parameters and pulmonary function tests of the patients were compared at the end of the second month, it was found that the FEV1, FEV1%, FVC, and FVC% values were statistically significantly higher in the methylprednisolone + pirfenidone group compared to the methylprednisolone group (p=0.025, p=0.012, p=0.026, and p=0.017, respectively). When the rates of change in CT scans at diagnosis and second month of treatment were examined, it was found that the involvement rates in the methylprednisolone + pirfenidone group were statistically significantly decreased (p<0.001). CONCLUSION Antifibrotic agents can reduce fibrosis that may develop in the future. These can also help dose reduction and/or non-use strategy for methylprednisolone therapy, which has many side effects. Further large series and randomized controlled studies are needed on this subject.","Acat, Murat; Yildiz Gulhan, Pinar; Oner, Serkan; Turan, Muhammed Kamil",International journal of clinical practice,188,1

Because a correlation between inspiratory muscle pressure (Pmus) and electrical activity of the diaphragm (EAdi) has been described, we aimed to assess the reliability of surface electromyography (EMG) of the respiratory muscles for monitoring diaphragm electrical activity and subject effort during assisted ventilation. METHODS At a general ICU of a single university-affiliated hospital, we enrolled subjects who were intubated and on pressure support ventilation (PSV) and were on mechanical ventilation for > 48 h. The subjects were studied at 3 levels of pressure support. Airway flow and pressure; esophageal pressure; EAdi; and surface EMG of the diaphragm (surface EAdi), intercostal, and sternocleidomastoid muscles were recorded. Respiratory cycles were sampled for off-line analysis. The Pmus/EAdi index (PEI) was calculated by relying on EAdi and surface EAdi (surface PEI) from an airway pressure drop during end-expiratory occlusions performed every minute. RESULTS surface EAdi well correlated with EAdi and Pmus, in particular, after averaging breaths into deciles (R = 0.92 and R = 0.84). When surface PEI was used with surface EAdi, it provided a reliable estimation of Pmus (R = 0.94 in comparison with measured Pmus). CONCLUSIONS During assisted mechanical ventilation, EAdi can be reliably monitored by both EAdi and surface EMG. The measurement of Pmus based on the calibration of EAdi was also feasible by the use of surface EMG.","Bellani, Giacomo; Bronco, Alfio; Arrigoni Marocco, Stefano; Pozzi, Matteo; Sala, Vittoria; Eronia, Nilde; Villa, Giulia; Foti, Giuseppe; Tagliabue, Giovanni; Eger, Marcus; Pesenti, Antonio",Respiratory care,188,19

Clear expectations, high sensitivity and specificity, and manufacturer disclosure will facilitate excellence of tests. OBJECTIVES To derive mathematical equations for designing and interpreting COVID-19 tests, assess Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Emergency Use Authorization and Health Canada minimum requirements, establish sensitivity and specificity tiers, and enhance clinical performance in low prevalence settings. DESIGN PubMed and other sources generated articles on COVID-19 testing and prevalence. EndNote X9.1 consolidated references. Mathematica and open access software helped prove equations, perform recursive calculations, graph multivariate relationships, and visualize patterns, including a new relationship, predictive value geometric mean-squared. RESULTS Derived equations were used to illustrate shortcomings of COVID-19 diagnostics in low prevalence. Visual logistics helped establish sensitivity/specificity tiers. FDA/Canada's 90% sensitivity, 95% specificity minimum requirements generate excessive false positives at low prevalence. False positives exceed true positives at <5.3% prevalence, or if sensitivity is improved to 100% and specificity to 98%, at <2% prevalence. Recursive testing improves predictive value. Three tiers emerged from these results. With 100% sensitivity, physicians can select desired predictive values, then input local prevalence, to determine suitable specificity. CONCLUSIONS Understanding low prevalence impact will help healthcare providers meet COVID-19 needs for effective testing. Laypersons should receive clinical performance disclosure when submitting specimens. Home testing needs to meet the same high standards as other tests. In the long run, it will be more cost-effective to improve COVID-19 POC tests rather than repeat testing multiple times.","Kost, Gerald J",Archives of pathology & laboratory medicine,188,24

However, a subset of patients fails to respond or relapse after CD19 CAR T cell therapy, in part due to antigen loss, which has prompted the search for alternative antigen targets. CD22 is another antigen found on the surface of B cells. CARs targeting CD22 alone or in combination with other antigens have been investigated in several pre-clinical and clinical trials. Given the heterogeneity and small size of CAR T cell therapy clinical trials, systematic reviews are needed to evaluate their efficacy and safety. Here, we propose a systematic review of CAR T cell therapies targeting CD22, alone or in combination with other antigen targets, in B cell malignancies. METHODS We will perform a systematic search of EMBASE, MEDLINE, Web of Science, Cochrane Register of Controlled Trials, clinicaltrials.gov, and the International Clinical Trials Registry Platform. Ongoing and completed clinical trials will be identified and cataloged. Interventional studies investigating CD22 CAR T cells, including various multi-antigen targeting approaches, in patients with relapsed or refractory B cell malignancies will be eligible for inclusion. Only full-text articles, conference abstracts, letters, and case reports will be considered. Our primary outcome will be a complete response, defined as absence of detectable cancer. Secondary outcomes will include adverse events, overall response, minimal residual disease, and relapse, among others. Quality assessment will be performed using a modified Institute of Health Economics tool designed for interventional single-arm studies. We will report a narrative synthesis of clinical studies, presented in tabular format. If appropriate, a meta-analysis will be performed using a random effects model to synthesize results. DISCUSSION The results of the proposed review will help inform clinicians, patients, and other stakeholders of the risks and benefits of CD22 CAR T cell therapies. It will identify gaps or inconsistencies in outcome reporting and help to guide future clinical trials investigating CAR T cells.

Observational data indicate considerable practice variation which may be driven by differences in sedation and mobilisation practices. The benefits and harms of either strategy are largely unknown. METHODS A scoping review will be prepared according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) extension for scoping reviews. We will review the clinical literature on controlled versus spontaneous breathing in mechanically ventilated patients with ARDS of any severity. Studies reporting on qualitative and/or quantitative data from any world region will be considered. For inclusion, studies must include data on mechanically ventilated patients with ARDS who are allowed spontaneous (triggered ventilation).

The function of SGs is poorly understood, but they are thought to be sites for reorganizing mRNA and protein. Several viruses can modulate SG formation, suggesting that SGs have an impact on virus infection. In this study, we have investigated the relationship of SG formation in Drosophila S2 cells infected by cricket paralysis virus (CrPV), a member of the Dicistroviridae family. Despite a rapid shutoff of host translation during CrPV infection, several hallmark SG markers such as the Drosophila TIA-1 and G3BP (RasGAP-SH3-binding protein) homologs, Rox8 and Rin, respectively, do not aggregate in CrPV-infected cells, even when challenged with potent SG inducers such as heat shock, oxidative stress, and pateamine A treatment. Furthermore, we demonstrate that a subset of P body markers become moderately dispersed at late times of infection. In contrast, as shown by fluorescent in situ hybridization, poly(A)(+) RNA granules still form at late times of infection. These poly(A)(+) RNA granules do not contain viral RNA nor do they colocalize with P body markers. Finally, our results demonstrate that the CrPV viral 3C protease is sequestered to SGs under cellular stress but not during virus infection. In summary, we propose that dicistrovirus infection leads to the selective inhibition of distinct SGs so that viral proteins are available for viral processing.","Khong, Anthony; Jan, Eric",Journal of virology,188,8

Flow disruption with the WEB is a potentially interesting endovascular treatment for this type of aneurysm. OBJECTIVE To report in a multicenter series the preliminary treatment experience of MCA aneurysms with flow disruption by the WEB. METHODS Thirty-three patients with 34 MCA aneurysms were treated with the WEB in 5 European centers. The ability to successfully deploy the WEB, procedure- and device-related adverse events, morbidity and mortality of the treatment, and short-term angiographic follow-up results were analyzed. RESULTS Most treated aneurysms were unruptured (85.3%) and were between 5 and 10 mm (85.3%) with a neck size ≥ 4 mm (88.2%). The treatment failed in 1 of the 34 aneurysms (2.9%) owing to a lack of appropriate device size. Treatment was performed exclusively with the WEB in 29 of 33 aneurysms (87.9%). Additional treatment (coiling and/or stenting) was used in 4 of 33 aneurysms (12.1%). Mortality of the treatment was 0.0% and morbidity was 3.1% (intraoperative rupture with modified Rankin Scale score of 3 at the 1-month follow-up). In short-term follow-up (range, 2-12 months), adequate occlusion (total occlusion or neck remnant) was observed in 83.3% of aneurysms. CONCLUSION WEB flow disruption seems to be a promising technique for the treatment of complex MCA aneurysms, particularly those with a wide neck or unfavorable dome-to-neck ratio.","Pierot, Laurent; Klisch, Joachim; Cognard, Christophe; Szikora, Istvan; Mine, Benjamin; Kadziolka, Krzysztof; Sychra, Vojtech; Gubucz, Istvan; Januel, Anne-Christine; Lubicz, Boris",Neurosurgery,188,19

RECENT FINDINGS There are no new leads in the prevention and early intervention of depression in children and adolescents. For acute treatment of major depressive disorder, talking therapies are moving increasingly to internet-based platforms. Family therapy may have a slight edge over individual psychotherapy in the short-term. Patients with severe depression with endogenous features have a more robust response to pharmacotherapy than do patients with mild-to-moderate depression. Findings in relation to reward sensitivity and changes in brain-derived neurotrophic factor levels contradict research conducted in adults, suggesting developmental differences in the mechanisms underlying depression. Ketamine infusion could have a role for adolescents with treatment refractory depression. There was no new evidence concerning relapse prevention.

High frequency oscillatory ventilation (HFOV) is often used for neonates with refractory respiratory failure related to RDS. Volume guarantee (VG) mode has been added to some HFOV ventilators for providing consistent tidal volume. We sought to examine the impact of adding the VG mode during HFOV on systemic and cerebral hemodynamics, which has not been studied to date. A neonatal piglet model of moderate to severe RDS was induced by saline lavage. Piglets (full term, age 1-3 days, weight 1.5-2.4 kg) were randomized to have RDS induced and receive either HFOV or HFOV+VG (n = 8/group) or sham-operation (n = 6) without RDS. Cardiac function measured by a Millar® catheter placed in the left ventricle as well as systemic and carotid hemodynamic and oxygen tissue saturation parameters were collected over 240 min of ventilation. Mean airway pressure, alveolar-arterial oxygen difference and left ventricular cardiac index of piglets on HFOV vs. HFOV+VG were not significantly different during the experimental period. Right common carotid artery flow index by in-situ ultrasonic flow measurement and cerebral tissue oxygen saturation (near-infrared spectroscopy) significantly decreased in HFOV+VG at 240 min compared to HFOV (14 vs. 31 ml/kg/min, and 30% vs. 43%, respectively; p<0.05). There were no significant differences in lung, brain and heart tissue markers of oxidative stress, ischemia and inflammation. HFOV+VG compared to HFOV was associated with similar left ventricular function, however HFOV+VG had a negative effect on cerebral blood flow and oxygenation.","Bhogal, Jagmeet; Solevåg, Anne Lee; O'Reilly, Megan; Lee, Tze-Fun; Joynt, Chloe; Hornberger, Lisa K; Schmölzer, Georg M; Cheung, Po-Yin",PloS one,188,11

Various antibiotic regimens have been widely used in the treatment of NEC. OBJECTIVES To compare the efficacy of different antibiotic regimens on mortality and the need for surgery in neonates with NEC. SEARCH METHODS Searches were made of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, The Cochrane Library, Issue 1, 2012), Oxford Database of Perinatal Trials, MEDLINE (1966 to February 2012), EMBASE (1980 to February 2012) and CINAHL (1982 to February 2012). SELECTION CRITERIA All randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials where antibiotic regimens were used for treatment of NEC. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS Eligibility of studies for inclusion was assessed independently by each review author. The criteria and standard methods of the Cochrane Neonatal Review Group were used to assess the methodological quality of the included trials. MAIN RESULTS Two trials met the inclusion criteria. Faix 1988 randomised 42 premature infants with radiological diagnosis of NEC. Infants were randomised to receive either intravenous ampicillin and gentamicin or ampicillin, gentamicin and clindamycin. Hansen 1980 randomised 20 infants with NEC to receive intravenous ampicillin and gentamicin with or without enteral gentamicin.In the study by Faix 1988, there were no statistical differences in mortality (RR 1.10; 95% CI 0.32 to 3.83) or bowel perforation (RR 2.20; 95% CI 0.45 to 10.74) between the two groups although there was a trend towards higher rate of strictures in the group that received clindamycin (RR 7.20; 95% CI 0.97 to 53.36).The Hansen 1980 study showed no statistically significant difference in death, bowel perforation or development of strictures. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS There was insufficient evidence to recommend a particular antibiotic regimen for the treatment of NEC. There were concerns about adverse effects following the usage of clindamycin, related to the development of strictures. To address this issue a large randomised controlled trial needs to be performed.","Shah, Dharmesh; Sinn, John K H",The Cochrane database of systematic reviews,188,1

The goal of this study was to experimentally assess the responses of pigs with and without a history of tonsillectomy to oral vaccination with heat-inactivated M. bovis and challenge with a virulent M. bovis field strain, to compare pig and wild boar responses using the same vaccination model as previously used in the Eurasian wild boar (Sus scrofa), to evaluate the use of several enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) and lateral flow tests for in vivo TB diagnosis in pigs, and to verify if these tests are influenced by oral vaccination with inactivated M. bovis. At necropsy, the lesion and culture scores were 20% to 43% higher in the controls than those in the vaccinated pigs. Massive M. bovis growth from thoracic tissue samples was observed in 4 out of 9 controls but in none of the 10 vaccinated pigs. No effect of the presence or absence of tonsils was observed on these scores, suggesting that tonsils are not involved in the protective response to this vaccine in pigs. The serum antibody levels increased significantly only after challenge. At necropsy, the estimated sensitivities of the ELISAs and dual path platform (DPP) assays ranged from 89% to 94%. In the oral mucosa, no differences in gene expression were observed in the control group between the pigs with and without tonsils. In the vaccinated group, the mRNA levels for chemokine (C-C motif) receptor 7 (CCR7), interferon beta (IFN-β), and methylmalonyl coenzyme A mutase (MUT) were higher in pigs with tonsils.

We report on the development and implementation of an internet-based COVID-19 participatory surveillance tool in rural Appalachia. METHODS A regional collaboration among public health partners culminated in the design and implementation of the COVID-19 Self-Checker, a local online symptom tracker. The tool collected data on participant demographic characteristics and health history. County residents were then invited to take part in an automated daily electronic follow-up to monitor symptom progression, assess barriers to care and testing, and collect data on COVID-19 test results and symptom resolution. RESULTS Nearly 6500 county residents visited and 1755 residents completed the COVID-19 Self-Checker from April 30 through June 9, 2020.

The aim of the study was to determine oxidative stress parameters, the lipid peroxidation product malondialdehyde, and antioxidant enzymes superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase in BOAS patients before and after surgical treatment and in healthy brachycephalic dogs. Material and Methods Nine healthy brachycephalic dogs that had not undergone surgery and 39 BOAS patients were included in the study. The BOAS patients were classified as grade 1 (5/34), grade 2 (16/34), and grade 3 (13/34) based on the decrease in the radius of the airway in the larynx. In BOAS patients, oxidative stress parameters were determined before and two weeks after surgery, while in control dogs, blood samples were collected only on inclusion to the study. Results All BOAS patients showed various degrees of improvement in clinical signs after surgery. Significantly lower (P < 0.05) SOD activity was found in grade 2 and 3 BOAS patients than in grade 1 patients. Two weeks after surgery, a significant (P < 0.05) increase in SOD activity in grade 2 and 3 patients was observed.

While the negative impacts of plastics are widely reported, particularly on marine vertebrates, impacts on microbial life remain poorly understood. Plastics impact microbiomes directly, exerting toxic effects, providing supplemental carbon sources and acting as rafts for microbial colonisation and dispersal. Indirect consequences include increased environmental shading, altered compositions of host communities and disruption of host organism or community health, hormone balances and immune responses. The isolation and application of plastic-degrading microbes are of substantial interest yet little evidence supports the microbial biodegradation of most high molecular weight synthetic polymers. Over 400 microbial species have been presumptively identified as capable of plastic degradation, but evidence for the degradation of highly prevalent polymers including polypropylene, nylon, polystyrene and polyvinyl chloride must be treated with caution; most studies fail to differentiate losses caused by the leaching or degradation of polymer monomers, additives or fillers. Even where polymer degradation is demonstrated, such as for polyethylene terephthalate, the ability of microorganisms to degrade more highly crystalline forms of the polymer used in commercial plastics appears limited. Microbiomes frequently work in conjunction with abiotic factors such as heat and light to impact the structural integrity of polymers and accessibility to enzymatic attack. Consequently, there remains much scope for extremophile microbiomes to be explored as a source of plastic-degrading enzymes and microorganisms. We propose a best-practice workflow for isolating and reporting plastic-degrading taxa from diverse environmental microbiomes, which should include multiple lines of evidence supporting changes in polymer structure, mass loss, and detection of presumed degradation products, along with confirmation of microbial strains and enzymes (and their associated genes) responsible for high molecular weight plastic polymer degradation. Such approaches are necessary for enzymatic degraders of high molecular weight plastic polymers to be differentiated from organisms only capable of degrading the more labile carbon within predominantly amorphous plastics, plastic monomers, additives or fillers.","Lear, G; Kingsbury, J M; Franchini, S; Gambarini, V; Maday, S D M; Wallbank, J A; Weaver, L; Pantos, O",Environmental microbiome,188,1

The locus coeruleus area in the brainstem and norepinephrine receptor (NER) signaling in forebrain cortical regions have been implicated in adaptive responding under stress, which is conceptually similar to compulsion-like responding (adaptive responding despite the presence of stress or conflict). Thus, we examined whether anterior insula (aINS)-to-brainstem connections and alpha-1 NERs regulated compulsion-like intake and alcohol-only drinking (AOD). Halorhodopsin inhibition of aINS-brainstem significantly reduced CLAD, with no effect on alcohol-only or saccharin intake, suggesting a specific aINS-brainstem role in aversion-resistant drinking. In contrast, prazosin inhibition of alpha-1 NERs systemically reduced both CLAD and AOD. Similar to systemic inhibition, intra-aINS alpha-1-NER antagonism reduced both CLAD and AOD. Global aINS inhibition with GABAR agonists also strongly reduced both CLAD and AOD, without impacting saccharin intake or locomotion, while aINS inhibition of calcium-permeable AMPARs (with NASPM) reduced CLAD without impacting AOD. Finally, prazosin inhibition of CLAD and AOD was not correlated with each other, systemically or within aINS, suggesting the possibility that different aINS pathways regulate CLAD versus AOD, which will require further study to definitively address. Together, our results provide important new information showing that some aINS pathways (aINS-brainstem and NASPM-sensitive) specifically regulate compulsion-like alcohol consumption, while aINS more generally may contain parallel pathways promoting CLAD versus AOD. These findings also support the importance of the adaptive stress response system for multiple forms of alcohol drinking.","De Oliveira Sergio, Thatiane; Lei, Kelly; Kwok, Claudina; Ghotra, Shahbaj; Wegner, Scott A; Walsh, Margaret; Waal, Jaclyn; Darevsky, David; Hopf, Frederic W",Neuropsychopharmacology : official publication of the American College of Neuropsychopharmacology,188,1

DESIGN Video case presentation with narration discussing the step-by-step robotic surgical approach to the removal of a pessary, via cystotomy, followed by vesicovaginal fistula and cystotomy repair. SETTING University of Louisville Hospital. The local Institutional Review Board deemed the video exempt from formal approval (Canadian Task Force Classification III). PATIENT A 77-year-old woman presented with complaints of vaginal leakage of urine, dysuria, and pelvic pain. She had a Gellhorn pessary placed 12 years prior without further evaluation or removal. The patient had a leukocytosis with a pseudomonal urinary tract infection. Imaging confirmed a Gellhorn pessary free floating within the urinary bladder. INTERVENTIONS The patient was taken to the operating room for an exam under anesthesia where a copious amount of urine was found coming from the vagina. A small vesicovaginal fistula was appreciated but could not be thoroughly explored. Cystoscopy revealed the foreign object in the urinary bladder. A robotic approach to the foreign body extraction was then performed with the davinci Xi robot (da Vinci Xi Intuitive Surgical, Sunnyvale, CA). The pessary was evident in the bladder on abdominal entry. Cystotomy was performed with the monopolar curved scissors. A vaginal EEA sizer was found to be advanced through the vesicovaginal fistula. The pessary was then grasped and removed from the bladder. Bilateral ureteral orifices were visualized. The fistula was then closed in 2 layers with 3-0 vicryl V-loc sutures (Covidien Medtronic, St. Paul, MN). The bladder was then closed in 2 layers with 3-0 vicryl V-loc sutures. A no. 15 Jackson-Pratt drain was then inserted through the right lower quadrant port and placed in the pelvis under direct visualization. The pessary was then removed via mini-laparotomy. A Foley catheter was left in place for prolonged drainage for a total of 6 weeks because of the multiple bladder repairs on the inflamed tissue. The patient denied any leakage of urine at her following postoperative appointment. CONCLUSION A robotic surgical approach, as an alternative to vaginal surgery, improves ease of dissection, provides a method for thorough anatomy surveillance, and can be used for successful repairs in complicated urogynecologic cases.","Goldsberry, Whitney; Metzinger, Daniel S",Journal of minimally invasive gynecology,188,31

Because high sequencing costs limit current studies to small numbers of good-quality samples, we propose a robust, cost- and time-effective method, called mutREAD, to detect mutational signatures from small quantities of DNA, including degraded samples. We show that mutREAD recapitulates mutational signatures identified by whole genome sequencing, and will ultimately allow the study of mutational signatures in larger cohorts and, by compatibility with formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded samples, in clinical settings.","Perner, Juliane; Abbas, Sujath; Nowicki-Osuch, Karol; Devonshire, Ginny; Eldridge, Matthew D; Tavaré, Simon; Fitzgerald, Rebecca C",Nature communications,188,28

These proteins use hydrophobic signal sequences or transmembrane (TM) segments to trigger their translocation through the protein-conducting Sec61/SecY channel. Substrates are first directed to the channel by cytosolic targeting factors, which use hydrophobic pockets to bind diverse signal and TM sequences. Subsequently, these hydrophobic sequences insert into the channel, docking into a groove on the outside of the lateral gate of the channel, where they also interact with lipids. Structural data and biochemical experiments have elucidated how channel partners, the ribosome in cotranslational translocation, and the eukaryotic ER chaperone BiP or the prokaryotic cytosolic SecA ATPase in posttranslational translocation move polypeptides unidirectionally across the membrane. Structures of auxiliary components of the bacterial translocon, YidC and SecD/F, provide additional insight. Taken together, these recent advances result in mechanistic models of protein translocation.","Rapoport, Tom A; Li, Long; Park, Eunyong",Annual review of cell and developmental biology,188,1

Although data from studies in rodents convincingly support the antiobesity and cardiometabolic benefits of intermittent fasting, its effects in human health are still debatable. RECENT FINDINGS Recent studies have examined the effect of two intermittent fasting approaches, that is, alternate day fasting (ADF) and time-restricted eating (TRE), on weight loss and cardiometabolic risk factors. ADF seems to be an equally effective weight loss approach to caloric restriction, but adherence to ADF is more challenging. ADF improves cardiometabolic risk factors, whereas it may have superior metabolic benefits compared to caloric restriction in people with insulin resistance. TRE with ad libitum food intake is well tolerated and induces 2-4% weight loss in approximatively 3 months. Additionally, TRE may have metabolic benefits particularly in people with metabolically abnormal obesity even without weight loss. SUMMARY Intermittent fasting is a promising nutritional approach against obesity and its related metabolic diseases. Further research is needed to: i) establish the long-term effectiveness of TRE in weight loss and metabolic health, ii) improve the long-term adherence to ADF and investigate its weight loss independent effects in metabolic health, and iii) determine the mechanisms underlying the potential cardiometabolic benefits of intermittent fasting in humans.","Zhu, Shengjie; Surampudi, Prasanth; Rosharavan, Baback; Chondronikola, Maria",Current opinion in clinical nutrition and metabolic care,188,23

The current experiments investigate the ability of these vertebrates to repair large articular cartilage defects and restore normal hyaline cartilage and joint structure independent of limb amputation. METHODS Full-thickness articular cartilage defects were made by resection of the medial femoral condyle to the level of the metaphysis. At 0, 2 days, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 18, 24, 36 and 48 weeks post-surgery, the repair process was analyzed on H&E and Safranin-O stained 7 μm tissue sections. Symmetric Kullback-Leibler (SKL) divergences were used to assess proteoglycan staining intensities. Immunohistochemistry was performed for collagen types I and II. RESULTS A fibrous ""interzone-like"" tissue occupies the intraarticular space of the axolotl femorotibial joint and no evidence of joint cavitation was observed. By 4 weeks post-surgery, cells within the defect site exhibited morphological similarities to those of the interzone-like tissue. At 24 weeks, joint structure and cartilaginous tissue repair were confirmed by immunohistochemistry for collagen types I and II. Quantitation of Safranin-O staining indicated restoration of proteoglycan content by 18 weeks. CONCLUSIONS The axolotl femorotibial joint has morphological similarities to the developing mammalian diarthrodial joint. Cells in the intraarticular space may be homologous to the interzone tissue and contribute to intrinsic repair of full-thickness articular cartilage defects. Taken together, these results suggest that the axolotl may serve as a valuable model for the investigation of cellular and molecular mechanisms that achieve full articular cartilage repair.","Cosden, R S; Lattermann, C; Romine, S; Gao, J; Voss, S R; MacLeod, J N",Osteoarthritis and cartilage,188,0

Estimates for exposure to non-SARS coronaviruses are high, particularly for 229E and OC43; however, less information regarding seroprevalence is available for HKU1 and NL63. To measure exposure rates to these four coronavirus strains (229E, HKU1, NL63, and OC43), we devised an immunoassay based on amino- and carboxy-terminally tagged recombinant coronavirus nucleocapsid antigens. Four human and one feline coronavirus antigen were cloned into baculoviruses expressed in insect cells and recovered proteins bound in the solid phase of an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay-based system. We screened sera from 10 children and 196 adults and established primary cutoff points based on immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibody levels of the predominantly seronegative children. The proportion of seropositive adults for each coronavirus was as follows: 229E, 91.3%; HKU1, 59.2%; NL63, 91.8%; and OC43, 90.8%. No evidence of a significant serological response to the feline coronavirus was observed. Significant associations of coronavirus seropositivity and antibody levels with age, gender, race, socioeconomic status, smoking status, and season of the blood draw were tested with chi-square and regression analyses. The group II coronaviruses (OC43 and HKU1) were significantly associated with race (P<or=0.009 and P<or=0.03, respectively). Elevated OC43 IgG levels were further significantly associated with smoking status (P<or=0.03), as were high NL63 titers with socioeconomic status (P<or=0.04). The high-level immunoreactivity of each coronavirus was significantly associated with the summer season (P<or=0.01 to 0.0001). In summary, high rates of exposure to 229E, NL63, and OC43 and a moderate rate of exposure to HKU1 characterized the seroprevalence among individuals in this population. Demographic factors, such as race, smoking status, and socioeconomic status, may confer an increased risk of susceptibility to these viruses.","Severance, Emily G; Bossis, Ioannis; Dickerson, Faith B; Stallings, Cassie R; Origoni, Andrea E; Sullens, Anne; Yolken, Robert H; Viscidi, Raphael P",Clinical and vaccine immunology : CVI,188,1

METHODS Patients undergoing thoracic surgery with general anesthesia were randomly allocated into five groups. In P0 group, PEEP was set to zero; in PLIP2 group, PEEP was set to 2 cmH2O plus the pressure of lower inflection point (LIP) of pressure-volume (P-V) curve; in PLIPS group, PEEP was titrated to achieve maximum static compliance from the averaged LIP pressure value; in groups PSTAT and PDYN, the incremental PEEP values were titrated to achieve maximum static compliance or maximum dynamic compliance from 4 cmH2O. Hemodynamic measurements, respiratory mechanics, and blood gas analyses were recorded at the beginning of OLV, OLV 15 min, OLV 30 min, OLV 45 min, and OLV 60 min. Also, the intrapulmonary shunt (Qs/Qt), physiological dead space to tidal volume ratio (VD/VT), and oxygenation index (OI) were calculated and compared. RESULTS Seventy-five patients consented to participate in this study. Dynamic compliance, peak inspiratory pressure (PIP), and plateau inspiratory pressure (Pplat) increased after PEEP titration during OLV. PIP, Qs/ Qt, and OI showed no differences among groups. Group PDYN showed lower Pplat, lower driving pressure, and higher dynamic compliance when compared with zero PEEP group. CONCLUSIONS The PEEP titrating strategy according to dynamic compliance can improve respiratory mechanics, whereas it has no significant effects on oxygenation, dead space ratio, and intrapulmonary shunt, suggesting that it is better during OLV for thoracic surgery.","Xu, Dian; Wei, Wei; Chen, Lianhua; Li, Shitong; Lian, Ming",Annals of palliative medicine,188,1

However, to our knowledge, the consequences of mask wearing on communication between surgeons and patients have not been studied. Objective To evaluate the effects of clear vs standard covered masks on communication during surgical clinic encounters. Design This randomized clinical trial examined communication between surgeons and their patients when surgeons wore clear vs covered masks in surgical outpatient clinics at a single academic medical center. New patients were recruited from participating surgeons' clinic schedules. Interventions Surgeons wore either clear masks or covered masks for each clinic visit with a new patient, based on a per-visit randomization plan. Main Outcomes and Measures The primary outcome measures included patient perceptions of (1) surgeon communication and (2) trust in surgeons, as well as (3) quantitative assessments and (4) qualitative assessments regarding patient impressions of the surgeon's mask. After the clinic encounter, patients completed a verbal survey including validated Clinician and Group Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems questions. Additional questions involved surgeon empathy, trust, and the patient's impression of the surgeon's mask. Data were analyzed by comparing patient data in the clear vs covered groups using Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel tests, and comments were analyzed for themes. Results Two hundred patients were enrolled from 15 surgeons' clinics spanning 7 subspecialties. When surgeons wore a clear mask, patients rated their surgeons higher for providing understandable explanations (clear, 95 of 100 [95%] vs covered, 78 of 100 [78%]; P < .001), demonstrating empathy (clear, 99 [99%] vs covered, 85 [85%]; P < .001), and building trust (clear, 94 [94%] vs covered, 72 [72%]; P < .001). Patients preferred clear masks (clear, 100 [100%] vs covered, 72 [72%]; P < .001), citing improved surgeon communication and appreciation for visualization of the face. Conversely, 8 of 15 surgeons (53%) were unlikely to choose the clear mask over their standard covered mask. Conclusions and Relevance This randomized clinical trial demonstrates that patients prefer to see their surgeon's face. Surgeons who wore clear masks were perceived by patients to be better communicators, have more empathy, and elicit greater trust. Because masks will remain part of the health care landscape for some time, deliberate attention to preserving communication within the surgeon-patient relationship is warranted.

Cyclophilins, which are a large family of cellular prolyl isomerases, have been found to inhibit Tomato bushy stunt tombusvirus (TBSV) replication in a Saccharomyces cerevisiae model based on genome-wide screens and global proteomics approaches. In this report, we further characterize single-domain cyclophilins, including the mammalian cyclophilin A and plant Roc1 and Roc2, which are orthologs of the yeast Cpr1p cyclophilin, a known inhibitor of TBSV replication in yeast. We found that recombinant CypA, Roc1, and Roc2 strongly inhibited TBSV replication in a cell-free replication assay. Additional in vitro studies revealed that CypA, Roc1, and Roc2 cyclophilins bound to the viral replication proteins, and CypA and Roc1 also bound to the viral RNA. These interactions led to inhibition of viral RNA recruitment, the assembly of the viral replicase complex, and viral RNA synthesis. A catalytically inactive mutant of CypA was also able to inhibit TBSV replication in vitro due to binding to the replication proteins and the viral RNA. Overexpression of CypA and its mutant in yeast or plant leaves led to inhibition of tombusvirus replication, confirming that CypA is a restriction factor for TBSV. Overall, the current work has revealed a regulatory role for the cytosolic single-domain Cpr1-like cyclophilins in RNA virus replication.","Kovalev, Nikolay; Nagy, Peter D",Journal of virology,188,19

Polyvinyl chloride double-lumen tube Broncho-Cath™ has been successfully used for one-lung ventilation in most cases of tracheal bronchus arising within 2 cm above the carina. However, there have been reports of occasional failure. A 78-year-old male patient diagnosed with secondary pneumothorax was scheduled for video-assisted thoracic surgery, and the tracheal bronchus originating 1.9 cm above the carina was shown in the preoperative chest computed tomography. Although a left-sided Broncho-Cath was initially placed, one-lung ventilation could not be achieved. Under bronchoscopy view through the tracheal lumen, the tracheal bronchus orifice was found to be partially obstructed. Furthermore, the bronchial cuff was herniated from the left main bronchus, leading to a failure of one-lung ventilation. The Broncho-Cath was replaced with a silicone double-lumen tube Human Broncho®, which has more flexible bronchial segment and an increased marginal gap between the bronchial cuff and the tracheal lumen opening. The Human Broncho was successfully placed in an optimal position within the left main bronchus without blocking the tracheal bronchus orifice, thereby achieving the successful one-lung ventilation.

Recently, clinical outbreaks of diarrhea in suckling piglets emerged in pig-producing areas of China. In this study, molecular detection of PEDV was conducted using RT-PCR (targeting the M gene) on samples collected from piglets with watery diarrhea from 15 pig farms, and phylogenetic analysis of PEDV field strains was carried out based on their M and S genes. In addition, the complete genome sequence of a PEDV field strain was determined. PEDV was detected in 92.7 % of the samples (267/288). The 15 M genes that were amplified shared 99.6-100 % nucleotide identity and 99.1-100 % amino acid similarity with each other. The 15 S genes exhibited 98.6-99.9 % homology, both at the nucleotide level and at the deduced amino acid level. Phylogenetic analysis showed that all of the amplified M genes grouped in cluster 3, together with some Chinese, Korean and Thai strains, while all of the amplified S genes were in cluster 3 and were closely related to Korean strains. Compared with previous PEDV strains, all of the S genes have common characteristics, namely, a 4-aa (GENQ) insertion between positions 55 and 56, a 1-aa (N) insertion between positions 135 and 136, and a 2-aa (DG) deletion between positions 155 and 156, similar or identical to Korean KNU-serial strains reported in recent years. The genome of the sequenced PEDV field strain is 28,038 nucleotides in length, excluding the poly (A) tail.

This study looks at how these boundaries are impacted for nurses working directly with COVID-19 patients. The study conducted 24 semi-structured interviews with nurses. Through a thematic analysis the study found that the work-family boundaries have blurred due to concerns around the contagiousness and anxiety associated with the virus. In order to cope with these spillover and possible crossover effects, nurses use prosocial distortion and avoidance and create sub-boundaries at home.","Sahay, Surabhi; Wei, Wan",Health communication,188,26

We address the problem of inferring a causal direction from two observed discrete symbolic sequences X and Y. We present a framework which relies on lossless compressors for inferring context-free grammars (CFGs) from sequence pairs and quantifies the extent to which the grammar inferred from one sequence compresses the other sequence. We infer X causes Y if the grammar inferred from X better compresses Y than in the other direction. To put this notion to practice, we propose three models that use the Compression-Complexity Measures (CCMs) - Lempel-Ziv (LZ) complexity and Effort-To-Compress (ETC) to infer CFGs and discover causal directions without demanding temporal structures. We evaluate these models on synthetic and real-world benchmarks and empirically observe performances competitive with current state-of-the-art methods. Lastly, we present two unique applications of the proposed models for causal inference directly from pairs of genome sequences belonging to the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Using a large number of sequences, we show that our models capture directed causal information exchange between sequence pairs, presenting novel opportunities for addressing key issues such as contact-tracing, motif discovery, evolution of virulence and pathogenicity in future applications.","Sy, Pranay; Nagaraj, Nithin",Journal of biomedical informatics,188,31

This analysis assessed incidence rates of these malignancies in Japanese patients with ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease, and their association with thiopurine and/or anti-tumor necrosis factor-α treatment, using data from a nationwide administrative database in Japan. METHODS Patients diagnosed with inflammatory bowel disease without malignancy were identified from the Medical Data Vision database. Incident cases of non-melanoma skin cancers and non-Hodgkin lymphoma diagnosed after prescription of thiopurine and/or anti-tumor necrosis factor-α were identified between April 2008 and January 2018. Age- and sex-adjusted incidence rate ratios were calculated relative to the total treated patient population. RESULTS 75 673 eligible patients were identified at the index date. Thiopurine prescription with or without anti-tumor necrosis factor-α agents increased incidence rate ratios for non-melanoma skin cancers relative to the overall population (3.39 and 4.03, respectively). There were no notable differences in non-Hodgkin lymphoma incidence relative to the total population in any treatment subgroup, regardless of prescription of a thiopurine and/or anti-tumor necrosis factor-α (all incidence rate ratios, ~1). CONCLUSIONS There is no evidence for an increased incidence of non-Hodgkin lymphoma attributable to thiopurine or anti-tumor necrosis factor-α treatment in Japanese patients with inflammatory bowel disease. The impact of racial differences on non-Hodgkin lymphoma incidences should be considered. Thiopurine therapy may be a risk factor for non-melanoma skin cancers in Japanese patients.","Kobayashi, Taku; Uda, Akihito; Udagawa, Eri; Hibi, Toshifumi",Journal of Crohn's & colitis,188,17

Outcome measures such as return to employment and body mass index (BMI) have not been reported and are necessary for comparison with open transcranial approaches. Most prior reports of the endoscopic, endonasal approach have reported unacceptably high cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leak rates. OBJECTIVE To assess the outcome of endoscopic, endonasal surgery in a consecutive series of craniopharyngiomas with special attention to extent of resection, CSF leak, return to employment, and BMI. METHODS Twenty-six surgeries were performed on 24 patients at Weill Cornell Medical College-New York Presbyterian Hospital. Five patients had recurrent lesions. Gross-total resection (GTR) was attempted in 21 surgeries. Indications for intended subtotal resection were advanced age, medical comorbidities, preservation of pituitary function, and hypothalamic invasion. RESULTS Mean tumor diameter was 2.9 cm. GTR (18 surgeries) or near-total (>95%) resection (2 surgeries) was achieved in 95% when GTR was the goal. Seven patients received postoperative radiation therapy. Mean follow-up was 35 months with no recurrences in GTR cases and stable disease in all patients at last follow-up. Vision improved in 77%. Diabetes insipidus and panhypopituitarism developed in 42% and 38%, respectively. A more than 9% increase in BMI occurred in 39%; 69% returned to their preoperative profession/schooling. The postoperative CSF leak rate was 3.8%. CONCLUSION Minimal-access, endoscopic, endonasal surgery for craniopharyngioma can achieve high rates of GTR with low rates of CSF leak. Return to employment and obesity rates are comparable to microscope-assisted transcranial and transsphenoidal reports.","Leng, Lewis Z; Greenfield, Jeffrey P; Souweidane, Mark M; Anand, Vijay K; Schwartz, Theodore H",Neurosurgery,188,27

MATERIALS AND METHODS Laparoscopic right colectomy was performed in 78 patients (10 with benign disease, 68 with carcinoma). Demographic, intraoperative, pathologic examination, and short-term outcome data were retrospectively compared between 25 patients operated by surgical residents (R group) and 53 patients operated by senior surgeons (S group). The residents who performed surgeries in the R group had between 1 and 6 years after graduation; no experience with open or laparoscopic colorectal surgery was necessary. The residents completed a training program under supervision of a single expert laparoscopic colorectal surgeon, which included 6 steps, from basic skills to certification. RESULTS There were no differences in patient age, sex, and body mass index between the R and S groups. Significantly more patients in the R group had early cancer and benign lesions (P<0.05). Thirteen of the 16 residents (81.2 %) had not had prior experience with colonic resection. The time of suturing and knot tying in the dry box did not differ between residents and senior surgeons (68 and 69 s, respectively). All the residents performed laparoscopic right colectomy without intraoperative complications. There were no significant differences in operating time (R group: 173±34 min, S group: 172±52 min), mean estimated blood loss (50±111 vs. 49±100 mL), number of lymph nodes dissected (20.8±12.8 vs. 17.1±9.0), and mean postoperative hospital stay (9.1±3.3 vs. 10.7±4.1 d). On the basis of the year of their residency period, all 3 residents at 6 years after graduation had far greater experience than the other residents and therefore performed the surgery with minor verbal support from the expert. However, residents with 1 or 2 years after graduation had to receive guidance provision by the expert during surgery. CONCLUSIONS When supervised and led by an expert laparoscopic surgeon, surgical residents are capable of performing laparoscopic surgery without negative effects on outcomes.","Homma, Shigenori; Kawamata, Futoshi; Yoshida, Tadashi; Ohno, Yosuke; Ichikawa, Nobuki; Shibasaki, Susumu; Kawamura, Hideki; Takahashi, Norihiko; Taketomi, Akinobu","Surgical laparoscopy, endoscopy & percutaneous techniques",188,1

However, in some cases, these wires may remain in situ and are often considered as a contraindication for cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging in the future. Therefore, we aimed to provide data about safety and image quality of CMR in these patients. METHODS This is a report on a subpopulation out of 88 patients after heart transplantation that were included in a prospective cohort study and underwent multiple CMR in their post-transplant course. During CMR, patients were monitored by electrocardiogram and all examinations were observed by a physician to document potential adverse events. Additionally, image quality was assessed by an imaging specialist. RESULTS Nineteen of 88 patients included had temporary pacing wires in situ. These patients underwent a total of 51 CMR studies. No major adverse event and only one single, mild sensory event could be documented. All CMR studies showed preserved diagnostic image quality. Temporary pacing wires were visible in 100% of HASTE and cine sequences. In less than 50% of the examinations, temporary pacing wires were also visible in T1 and T2 mapping, short tau inversion recovery (STIR), and late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) sequences, without any impairment of image quality. CONCLUSIONS With a low event rate of only one mild adverse event during 51 CMR examinations (2%), CMR appears to be safe in patients with retained temporary epicardial pacing wires after heart transplantation. Moreover, image quality was not impaired by the presence of pacing wires.","Gatterer, Constantin; Stelzmüller, Marie-Elisabeth; Kammerlander, Andreas; Zuckermann, Andreas; Krššák, Martin; Loewe, Christian; Beitzke, Dietrich",Journal of cardiovascular magnetic resonance : official journal of the Society for Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance,188,31

STUDY DESIGN A pilot experimental study. ANIMALS Eight healthy beagle dogs. METHODS SPRA was performed on the left and right sides (4 dogs each). Resection of the adrenal gland was performed through a SILS port using a retroperitoneal approach. Operative time was defined from skin incision to the completion of skin suture. Postoperative pain was evaluated by using 3 pain scores. Integrity of the adrenal gland capsule was evaluated by histologic assessment. RESULTS Mean time taken to complete the SPRA was 44.1 minutes (range, 37-51) and was significantly longer on the right side than on the left side (P < .05). There were no complications intraoperatively or during 14 days of postoperative monitoring. The adrenal gland capsule was found to be injured in 3 of the 8 dogs by histologic assessment. CONCLUSION This is the first report of SPRA in the veterinary literature. With this technique it is possible to perform adrenalectomy with some risk of capsule penetration and with excellent visibility.

Although these robots are reportedly effective for specific tasks in experimental environments, there is little information about their effectiveness at nursing care facilities. The aim of this study was to identify care tasks and operations suitable for the use of these robots among caregivers in nursing facilities where these robots have been in use on a daily basis. METHODS A 1-min observational time-motion analysis was conducted to examine care tasks and operations in two nursing facilities where wearable transfer support robots, namely Muscle Suit or HAL® Lumbar Type for Care Support, have been used routinely on a daily basis for more than 24 months. RESULTS Analysis of the care tasks and their time ratio while wearing the equipment revealed that both robots were used conspicuously for direct care in over 70% of transits, especially during transfer assistance and toileting care. Furthermore, these robots were used intensively in the morning along with wake-up calls to care recipients, where pre-assigned wearers used them as part of their ""routine work."" CONCLUSIONS We found that these wearable transfer support robots enabled effective performance of care tasks and operations in nursing facilities where these robots have been used on a daily basis for an extended period of time.

Although interventions such as Dance Movement Therapy (DMT) may offer interesting and acceptable treatment options, current clinical guidelines do not include these interventions in their recommendations mainly because of what is perceived as insufficient research evidence. The 2015 Cochrane review on DMT for depression includes only three studies leading to inconclusive results. In a small and underfunded field such as DMT, expensive multi-centered Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs) are as yet rare. It is therefore, necessary to not only capture evidence from RCTs, but to also look beyond such designs in order to identify and assess the range of current evidence. Methods: We therefore conducted a systematic review of studies that aimed to explore the effectiveness in the use of DMT with people with depression. This led to a qualitative narrative synthesis. We also performed meta-analyses that calculated the effect size for all included studies, studies with RCT designs only, followed by a subgroup analysis and a sensitivity analysis. In all meta-analyses a random effects model was used with Standardized Mean Differences (SMD) to accommodate for the heterogeneity of studies and outcome measures. Results: From the 817 studies reviewed, eight studies were identified as meeting our inclusion criteria. Three hundred and fifty one people with depression (mild to severe) participated, 192 of whom attended DMT groups while receiving treatment as usual (TAU) and 159 received TAU only. Qualitative findings suggest there was a decrease in depression scores in favor of DMT groups in all studies. Subgroup analysis performed on depression scores before and 3 months after the completion of DMT groups suggested changes in favor of the DMT groups. When sensitivity analysis was performed, RCTs at high risk of bias were excluded, leaving only studies with adult clients up to the age of 65. In these studies, the highest effect size was found favoring DMT plus TAU for adults with depression, when compared to TAU only. Conclusions: Based on studies with moderate to high quality, we concluded that DMT is an effective intervention in the treatment of adults with depression. Furthermore, by drawing on a wide range of designs with diverse quality, we were able to compile a comprehensive picture of relevant trends relating to the use of DMT in the treatment of depression. Despite the fact that there remains a paucity of high-quality studies, the results have relevance to both policy-making and clinical practice, and become a platform for further research.","Karkou, Vicky; Aithal, Supritha; Zubala, Ania; Meekums, Bonnie",Frontiers in psychology,188,1

Bile reflux as a cause of pain after laparoscopic RYGB has not been previously described. We report on a series of patients with chronic pain after RYGB as a result of bile reflux owing an abnormally short alimentary limb. METHODS A prospective database of patients who underwent revisional surgery to treat symptomatic bile reflux at our center was retrospectively reviewed and analyzed for the onset of symptoms, interval to revision, length of alimentary limb, and outcome after revision. RESULTS A total of 16 patients were diagnosed with bile reflux and underwent revisional surgery. The onset of symptoms occurred at 58.3 +/- 22.2 months after RYGB. All patients complained of pain, 13 (81.3%) had vomiting, and 7 (43.8%) had dysphagia. Endoscopy was performed in all patients and confirmed the presence of bile in all patients and detected marginal ulceration in 5 (31.3%) and gastritis in 8 (50.0%). At revisional surgery, the mean alimentary limb length was 37.7 +/- 12.4 cm (range 20-62 cm). At a mean follow-up of 14.9 months after revision, all patients had reported resolution of their symptoms. CONCLUSION Although previously unreported after RYGB, bile reflux can be an important possible cause of chronic pain. Bile reflux, however, responds favorably to alimentary limb lengthening to 100 cm and was not been seen in patients with an alimentary limb length >62 cm.","Swartz, Daniel E; Mobley, Elijah; Felix, Edward L",Surgery for obesity and related diseases : official journal of the American Society for Bariatric Surgery,188,1

Advances in catheter-based techniques and newer liquid embolic agents, as well as recognition of the effectiveness of minimally invasive treatment options, have expanded the role of interventional radiology in the treatment of acute NVGIB. Many embolic agents have been used successfully. However, no guidelines exist about the choice of the best embolic agent which is still controversial. Cyanoacrylate glue has gained acceptance over time. This article aims to address the current role of TAE using cyanoacrylate glue for the treatment of acute NVGIB. AREAS COVERED The authors undertook a literature review of the current evidence on the use of cyanoacrylate glue in treating patients with acute NVGIB. EXPERT OPINION The evidence shows that cyanoacrylate glue is the most clinically useful embolic agent in treating patients with acute NVGIB, despite the need for learning curve, especially in case of coagulopathy. At present, research is ongoing to assess liquid embolic agents in the treatment of patients presenting with acute NVGIB.

Hypobaric hypoxia altered redox homeostasis and impaired calcium ion handling in skeletal muscles. Dysregulated Ca2+ homeostasis and activated calpain is the prime stressor in high altitude hypoxia while the reason for subsequent abnormal release of pathological Ca2+ into cytoplasm is largely unexplored. The present study identified the redox remodeling in the Ca2+ release channel, Ryanodine Receptor (RyR1) owing to its hypernitrosylation state in skeletal muscles in chronic hypobaric hypoxia exposed rats. RyR1-hypernitrosylation decreases the binding of FKBP12/calstabin-1 and other complexes from the channel, causing ""leakiness"" in RyR1 ion-channel. A strong RyR1 stabilizer, S107 enhanced binding affinity of FKBP12 with hypernitrosylated RyR1, reduced Sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum (SR) Ca2+ leak and improved muscle strength and function under chronic hypoxia. Administration of S107 inhibited the skeletal muscle damage, maintained ultrastructure of sarcomere and sarcolemmal integrity. Histological analysis proved the increase in cross-sectional area of myofibers. Further, the number of apoptotic cells was also reduced by S107 treatment. Conclusively, we proposed that the redox remodeling of RyR1 (hypernitrosylated-RyR1) might be responsible for dysregulated Ca2+ homeostasis which consequently impaired muscle strength and function in response to chronic hypoxic stress. Reduced SR Ca2+ leak and enhanced binding affinity of FKBP12 may provide a novel therapeutic avenue in ameliorating skeletal muscle atrophy at high altitude.","Agrawal, Akanksha; Rathor, Richa; Kumar, Ravi; Suryakumar, Geetha; Singh, Som Nath; Kumar, Bhuvnesh",Free radical biology & medicine,188,1

We established a bioresource with serial sampling of health care workers (HCWs) designed to obtain samples before and during mainly mild disease, with follow-up sampling to evaluate the quality and duration of immune memory. Methods: We conducted a prospective observational study on HCWs from three hospital sites in London, initially at a single centre (recruited just prior to first peak community transmission in London), but then extended to multiple sites 3 weeks later (recruitment still ongoing, target n=1,000). Asymptomatic participants attending work complete a health questionnaire, and provide a nasal swab (for SARS-CoV-2 RNA by RT-PCR tests) and blood samples (mononuclear cells, serum, plasma, RNA and DNA are biobanked) at 16 weekly study visits, and at 6 and 12 months. Results: Preliminary baseline results for the first 731 HCWs (400 single-centre, 331 multicentre extension) are presented. Mean age was 38±11 years; 67% are female, 31% nurses, 20% doctors, and 19% work in intensive care units. COVID-19-associated risk factors were: 37% black, Asian or minority ethnicities; 18% smokers; 13% obesity; 11% asthma; 7% hypertension and 2% diabetes mellitus. At baseline, 41% reported symptoms in the preceding 2 weeks. Preliminary test results from the initial cohort (n=400) are available: PCR at baseline for SARS-CoV-2 was positive in 28 of 396 (7.1%, 95% CI 4.9-10.0%) and 15 of 385 (3.9%, 2.4-6.3%) had circulating IgG antibodies. Conclusions: This COVID-19 bioresource established just before the peak of infections in the UK will provide longitudinal assessments of incident infection and immune responses in HCWs through the natural time course of disease and convalescence. The samples and data from this bioresource are available to academic collaborators by application https://covid-consortium.com/application-for-samples/.","Augusto, João B; Menacho, Katia; Andiapen, Mervyn; Bowles, Ruth; Burton, Maudrian; Welch, Sophie; Bhuva, Anish N; Seraphim, Andreas; Pade, Corinna; Joy, George; Jensen, Melanie; Davies, Rhodri H; Captur, Gabriella; Fontana, Marianna; Montgomery, Hugh; O'Brien, Ben; Hingorani, Aroon D; Cutino-Moguel, Teresa; McKnight, Áine; Abbass, Hakam; Alfarih, Mashael; Alldis, Zoe; Baca, Georgina L; Boulter, Alex; Bracken, Olivia V; Bullock, Natalie; Champion, Nicola; Chan, Carmen; Couto-Parada, Xose; Dieobi-Anene, Keenan; Feehan, Karen; Figtree, Gemma; Figtree, Melanie C; Finlay, Malcolm; Forooghi, Nasim; Gibbons, Joseph M; Griffiths, Peter; Hamblin, Matt; Howes, Lee; Itua, Ivie; Jones, Meleri; Jardim, Victor; Kapil, Vikas; Jason Lee, Wing-Yiu; Mandadapu, Vineela; Mfuko, Celina; Mitchelmore, Oliver; Palma, Susana; Patel, Kush; Petersen, Steffen E; Piniera, Brian; Raine, Rosalind; Rapala, Alicja; Richards, Amy; Sambile, Genine; Couto de Sousa, Jorge; Sugimoto, Michelle; Thornton, George D; Artico, Jessica; Zahedi, Dan; Parker, Ruth; Robathan, Mathew; Hickling, Lauren M; Ntusi, Ntobeko; Semper, Amanda; Brooks, Tim; Jones, Jessica; Tucker, Art; Veerapen, Jessry; Vijayakumar, Mohit; Wodehouse, Theresa; Wynne, Lucinda; Treibel, Thomas A; Noursadeghi, Mahdad; Manisty, Charlotte; Moon, James C",Wellcome open research,188,31

The retrospective study (October 2010-February 2012) focused in 167 male patients with prostate enlargement (mean age 64.7 years, range 47-81 years) who underwent selective pelvic arterial embolization for the relief of lower urinary tract symptoms. All patients underwent CTA previously to DSA to evaluate the vascular anatomy of the pelvis and to plan the treatment. MRAs were identified and classified according to their origin, trajectory, termination and relationship with surrounding arteries. We found MRAs in 60 (35.9 %) patients (23.9 % of pelvic sides, n = 80) and of those, 20 (12 %) had bilateral MRAs; 24 MRAs (30 %) were independent of neighbouring arteries and 56 MRAs (70 %) had common origins with prostatic arteries (prostato-rectal trunk). The most frequent MRA origin was the internal pudendal artery (60 %, n = 48), followed by the inferior gluteal artery (21.3 %, n = 17) and common gluteal-pudendal trunk (16.2 %, n = 13). In 2 patients the MRA originated from the obturator artery (2.5 %). Anastomoses to the superior rectal and inferior mesenteric arteries were found in 87.5 % of cases (n = 70). We concluded that MRAs are anatomical variants present in less than half of male patients; have variable origins and frequently share common origins with prostatic arteries. Their correct identification is likely to contribute to improve interventional radiology procedures and prostatic or rectal surgeries.","Bilhim, Tiago; Pereira, José A; Tinto, Hugo Rio; Fernandes, Lúcia; Duarte, Marisa; O'Neill, João E; Pisco, João M",Surgical and radiologic anatomy : SRA,188,30

Sister chromatid cohesion resists microtubule forces, generating tension, which provides the signal that biorientation has occurred. How tension silences the surveillance pathways that prevent cell cycle progression and correct erroneous kinetochore-microtubule attachments remains unclear. Here we show that SUMOylation dampens error correction to allow stable sister kinetochore biorientation and timely anaphase onset. The Siz1/Siz2 SUMO ligases modify the pericentromere-localized shugoshin (Sgo1) protein before its tension-dependent release from chromatin. Sgo1 SUMOylation reduces its binding to protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), and weakening of this interaction is important for stable biorientation. Unstable biorientation in SUMO-deficient cells is associated with persistence of the chromosome passenger complex (CPC) at centromeres, and SUMOylation of CPC subunit Bir1 also contributes to timely anaphase onset. We propose that SUMOylation acts in a combinatorial manner to facilitate dismantling of the error correction machinery within pericentromeres and thereby sharpen the metaphase-anaphase transition.","Su, Xue Bessie; Wang, Menglu; Schaffner, Claudia; Nerusheva, Olga O; Clift, Dean; Spanos, Christos; Kelly, David A; Tatham, Michael; Wallek, Andreas; Wu, Yehui; Rappsilber, Juri; Jeyaprakash, A Arockia; Storchova, Zuzana; Hay, Ronald T; Marston, Adèle L",The Journal of cell biology,188,30

An overview of PubMed literature depicting the state of the art of urology residency in the COVID-19 era was performed as well, to contextualize the issue. METHODS An online learning event for residents was set up at the beginning of the pandemic; the faculty consisted of experts in urology who provided on-line lectures and videos on surgical anatomy, procedures, updates in guidelines, technology, training. The audience was composed of 30-500 attendees from Italy, USA, India and Belgium. A questionnaire to analyze relevance, satisfaction and popularity of the lessons was mailed to 30 local residents. RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS Almost all residents defined the web environment suitable to achieve the learning outcomes; the method, the number and the competence of the faculty were appropriate/excellent. Most of the younger residents (81.8%) stated their surgical knowledge would improve after the course; 72.7% declared they would take advantage into routine inpatients clinical activity. Nineteen more expert residents agreed that the course would improve their surgical knowledge and enhance their practical skills; almost all stated that the initiative would change their outpatients and inpatients practice. Overall, 44 articles available in PubMed have addressed the concern of urological learning and training during the pandemic from different standpoints; four of them considered residents' general perception towards web-based learning programs. CONCLUSIONS The paper confirms residents' satisfaction with e-learning methods and, to our knowledge, is the first one focusing on a specific event promptly settled up at the beginning of the outbreak. Web-based educational experience developed during the pandemic may represent the very basis for the implementation of prospective on-site training and overall scientific update of future urologists.","Calcagnile, Tommaso; Sighinolfi, Maria Chiara; Sarchi, Luca; Assumma, Simone; Filippi, Beatrice; Bonfante, Giulia; Cassani, Alessandra; Spandri, Valentina; Turri, Filippo; Puliatti, Stefano; Bozzini, Giorgio; Moschovas, Marcio; Bianchi, Giampaolo; Micali, Salvatore; Rocco, Bernardo",Urologia,188,1

Whether direct MT is equally effective as combined intravenous thrombolysis with MT (ie, bridging thrombolysis) remains unclear. METHODS We retrospectively compared clinical and radiological outcomes in 167 bridging patients with 255 patients receiving direct MT because of large artery anterior circulation stroke. We matched all patients from the direct MT group who would have qualified for intravenous tissue-type plasminogen activator with controls from the bridging group, using multivariate and propensity score analyses. Functional independence was defined as modified Rankin Scale score of 0 to 2. RESULTS From February 2009 to August 2014, 40 patients from the direct MT group would have qualified for bridging thrombolysis but were treated with MT only. Clinical and radiological characteristics did not differ from the bridging cohort, except for higher rates of hypercholesterolemia (P=0.019), coronary heart disease (P=0.039), and shorter intervals from symptom onset to endovascular intervention (P=0.01) in the direct MT group. Functional independence, mortality, and intracerebral hemorrhage rates did not differ (P>0.1). After multivariate matching analysis outcome in both groups did not differ, except for lower rates of asymptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage (P=0.023) and lower mortality (P=0.007) in the direct MT group. CONCLUSIONS In patients with large anterior circulation stroke, direct mechanical intervention seems to be equally effective as bridging thrombolysis. A randomized trial comparing direct MT with bridging therapy is warranted.","Broeg-Morvay, Anne; Mordasini, Pasquale; Bernasconi, Corrado; Bühlmann, Monika; Pult, Frauke; Arnold, Marcel; Schroth, Gerhard; Jung, Simon; Mattle, Heinrich P; Gralla, Jan; Fischer, Urs",Stroke,188,7

This trial was designed to study the effects of this treatment on pharyngeal stability evaluated by critical closing pressure in obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome. METHODS This single-centre, randomized, crossover, double-blind study compared active manipulation and sham manipulation of the SPG. Randomization was computer-generated. Patients each received one active manipulation and one sham manipulation at an interval of 21 days and were evaluated 30 min and 48 h after each session administered by a qualified osteopath. Neither the patients, nor the investigator performing the evaluations were informed about the order of the two techniques (double-blind). The primary endpoint was the percentage of responding patients presenting increased pharyngeal stability defined by a variation of critical closing pressure (Pcrit) of at least -4 cmH2O at 30 min. Secondary endpoints were the variation of Pcrit in absolute values, sleepiness and snoring. Others endpoints were lacrimation (Schirmer's test), induced pain, sensations experienced during OMT. RESULTS Ten patients were included and nine (57 [50; 58] years, comprising 7 men, with an apnoea-hypopnoea index of 31.0 [25.5; 33.2]/h; (values are median [quartiles])) were analysed. Seven patients were analysed for the primary endpoint and nine patients were analysed for secondary endpoints. Five patients responded after active manipulation versus no patients after sham manipulation (p = 0.0209). Active manipulation induced more intense pain (p = 0.0089), increased lacrimation (ns) and more tactile, nociceptive and gustatory sensations (13 versus 1) compared to sham manipulation. No significant difference was observed for the other endpoints. CONCLUSIONS Osteopathic manipulative treatment of the SPG may improve pharyngeal stability in obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome. This trial validates the feasibility of the randomized, controlled, double-blind methodology for evaluation of this osteopathic treatment. Studies on a larger sample size must specify the efficacy on the apnoea-hypopnoea index.

The subjects were patients receiving pre-dilution on-line HDF (n = 10) or HD (n = 10) at this hospital. Dialysis time was 4 h for all patients. In patients on HD, the blood flow rate was 200 mL/min and the dialysate flow rate was 463 ± 29.3 mL/min. In patients on pre-dilution on-line HDF, the blood flow rate was 240 ± 20 mL/min, the dialysate flow rate was 565.0 ± 42.5 mL/min, and the substitution flow rate (substitution volume) was 252.8 ± 26.4 mL/min (57.0 ± 6.0 L). Kt/V for urea was comparable between patients on HD and patients on pre-dilution on-line HDF (1.46 ± 0.25 vs. 1.46 ± 0.31). Amino acid loss and clear space were evaluated. Patients on pre-dilution on-line HDF lost significantly less glutamine and arginine (p < 0.01 and p = 0.032) and significantly less nonessential amino acids (NEAAs) than patients on HD (p = 0.013). They also had significantly lower clear space of total amino acids (TAAs), NEAAs, essential amino acids (EAAs), and branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) than patients on HD (Total AA p = 0.019, NEAA p = 0.018, EAA p = 0.024, BCAA p = 0.042).

The pigment release is believed to occur from retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) cells in the former and the posterior iris in the latter. The exact timing of this pre-retinal pigment deposition is unknown but typically is mild and occurs over several months. A rapid progression of diffuse preretinal pigmentation is uncommon and may be suggestive of persistent RPE release from an open break or continued iris trauma with posterior pigment release. This report describes a case of profound posterior pigment deposition more than 4 months after retinectomy and oil in a patient with a persistently open retinectomy edge with anterior retinal detachment. The rapidity of pigment deposition was the clue to recognizing this subtle anterior detachment under silicone oil.

Limited data exist regarding changes in heart transplant (HT). Objective To describe national and regional trends in waitlist inactivations, waitlist additions, donor recovery, and HT volume during COVID-19. Design, Setting, and Participants This descriptive cross-sectional study used publicly available data from the United Network for Organ Sharing and US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, using 8 prespecified United Network for Organ Sharing regions. Adult (18 years or older) HT candidates listed and deceased donors recovered between January 19 to May 9, 2020. Exposures COVID-19 pandemic. Main Outcomes and Measures Changes in waitlist inactivations, waitlist additions, deceased donor recovery, and transplant volumes from the pre-COVID-19 (January 19-March 15, 2020) to the COVID-19 era (March 15-May 9, 2020). Density mapping and linear regression with interrupted time series analysis were used to characterize changes over time and changes by region. Results During the COVID-19 era, there were 600 waitlist inactivations compared with 343 during the pre-COVID era (75% increase). Waitlist additions decreased from 637 to 395 (37% reduction). These changes were most profound in the Northeast and Great Lakes regions with high rates of COVID-19. Deceased donor recovery decreased by 26% from 1878 to 1395; the most significant decrease occurred in the North Midwest despite low COVID-19 prevalence. Heart transplant volumes were significantly reduced across all regions except the Northwest. The largest decrease was seen in the Northeast where COVID-19 case rates were highest. From the pre-COVID-19 era to the COVID-19 era, there was significant regional variation in waitlist additions (eg, 69% decrease in the Northeast vs 8.5% increase in the South Midwest; P < .001) and deceased donor recovery (eg, 41% decrease in North Midwest vs 16% decrease in South Midwest; P = .02). Conclusions and Relevance Heart transplant volumes have been significantly reduced in recent months, even in regions with a lower prevalence of COVID-19 cases. This has been accompanied by increased waitlist inactivations, decreased waitlist additions, and decreased donor recovery.

In this study, we have identified the major histocompatibility complex class I C molecule (HLA-C) as an attachment factor in facilitating HCoV-HKU1 spike (S)-mediated infection. HCoV-HKU1 S pseudotyped virus was assembled using a human immunodeficiency virus type 1-derived reporter virus harboring the human codon-optimized spike of HCoV-HKU1. We identified human alveolar epithelial A549 cells as the most susceptible cell line among those tested to infection by HCoV-HKU1 S pseudotypes. A549 cells were shown to bind purified soluble HCoV-HKU1 S(1-600) glycopeptide. To search for the functional receptor for HCoV-HKU1, an A549 cDNA expression library was constructed and transduced into the nonpermissive, baby hamster kidney cells line BHK-21. Transduced cells that bind soluble HCoV-HKU1 S(1-600) glycoprotein with C-terminal FLAG were sorted. Sequencing of two independent clones revealed cDNA inserts encoding HLA-C. Inhibition of HLA-C expression or function by RNAi silencing and anti-HLA-C antibody decreased HCoV-HKU1 S pseudotyped virus infection of A549 cells by 62 to 65%, whereas pretreatment of cells with neuraminidase decreased such infection by only 13%. When HLA-C was constitutively expressed in another nonpermissive cell line, NIH-3T3, quantitative PCR showed that the binding of HCoV-HKU1 S pseudotyped virus to cell surfaces was increased by 200-fold, but the cells remained nonsusceptible to HCoV-HKU1 S pseudotyped virus infection. Our data suggest that HLA-C is involved in the attachment of HCoV-HKU1 to A549 cells and is a potential candidate to facilitate cell entry. However, other unknown surface proteins on A549 cells may be concomitantly utilized by S glycoprotein of HCoV-HKU1 during viral entry. Further studies are required to elucidate other putative receptors or coreceptors for HCoV-HKU1 and the mechanism of HCoV-HKU1 S-mediated cell entry.","Chan, Che Man; Lau, Susanna K P; Woo, Patrick C Y; Tse, Herman; Zheng, Bo-Jian; Chen, Ling; Huang, Jian-Dong; Yuen, Kwok-Yung",Journal of virology,188,27

RESULTS Individuals with MCI (n = 9) scored lower than individuals without cognitive impairment (17.56 vs. 19.50; t = -2.28, p = .03, d = -1.00). Diagnostic accuracy for MCI ranged from 76% to 81%, with sensitivity ranging from 0.56 to 0.67 and specificity ranging from 0.92 to 1.00. Correlations of T-MoCA derived scores with traditional neuropsychological measures were quite modest, with the exception of the memory impairment scale. CONCLUSIONS This rapid communication presents preliminary validation of the T-MoCA for use in individuals with PD. Caveats and implications for practical use in the current pandemic are discussed.","Benge, Jared F; Kiselica, Andrew M",The Clinical neuropsychologist,188,8

Oxygen saturations (Sao(2)) may be useful in determining which febrile infants require chest x-rays (CXR) in investigation for bacterial pneumonia (PNA). This study aimed to determine whether Sao(2) is clinically useful in excluding bacterial PNA in febrile infants <24 months. METHODS A febrile infant registry was instituted at a tertiary care military hospital (55,000 annual patients, 27% children) from December 2002-December 2003. Eligible patients consisted of infants <3 months with temperature ≥38°C or 3-24 months with temperature ≥39°C. Bacterial PNA was defined in this cohort by a CXR revealing a 'lobar infiltrate' by a board-certified radiologist. Descriptive statistics are presented on groups who received CXR versus groups who did not, and on infants who had bacterial PNA versus those who did not. Student t tests were used to compare maximum temperature (Tmax), RR, and Sao(2). Logistic regression for PNA was performed using age, sex, Tmax, RR, HR and Sao(2). A Receiver Operator Characteristic (ROC) curve was created to show Sao(2) cut-off points as related to sensitivity and specificity. RESULTS 985 patients (55% boys; median age: 12 months) met entry criteria. 790 underwent CXR and 82 were diagnosed with bacterial PNA. Sao(2) was lower in infants with bacterial PNA (96.6%±2.5% vs 97.7%±1.8%, p<0.001). Sao(2) was also predictive of bacterial PNA by logistic regression (p=0.017) but the ROC curve yielded a poor sensitivity/specificity profile (area under curve (AUC) of 0.6786). CONCLUSIONS In febrile infants, Sao(2) was not found to be clinically useful for excluding bacterial PNA.","Simon, Leslie V; Carstairs, Keri L; Reardon, Jacqueline M; Rudinsky, Sherri L; Riffenburgh, Robert H; Tanen, David A",Emergency medicine journal : EMJ,188,28

PI has been shown to correlate with cardiac performance. In theory, PI is readily available on every pulse oximeter; therefore, no additional sensors or infant handling are required. Currently, reference values are lacking in (preterm) neonates and the association with common clinical conditions is unclear. OBJECTIVES To establish reference values for the PI in premature infants and at the same time determine the influence of common clinical conditions. METHODS PI was prospectively monitored on the lower limb for 72 h in 311 neonates born with a gestational age <32 weeks between January 2011 and December 2013. Longitudinal mixed-effects modeling was used. Linear, quadratic, and cubic models were explored. Main effects and interactions were investigated. RESULTS A squared model (0-24 h) followed by a linear model (24-72 h) provided the best fit of the data. PI was lowest around 12-18 h after birth and showed a steady increase thereafter. PI was positively related with female gender, gestational age, and pulse pressure. Negative associations were found with SIMV/HFOV ventilation, dopamine administration, mean arterial blood pressure, and arterial oxygen saturation. Although more complex, the general association with a patent ductus arteriosus was positive. CONCLUSION PI varied according to several clinical conditions. The association with common clinical factors suggests that PI might be used for monitoring neonatal hemodynamics and possibly as an additional guidance for interventions.","Alderliesten, Thomas; Lemmers, Petra M A; Baerts, Willem; Groenendaal, Floris; van Bel, Frank",Neonatology,188,1

We assessed tubular 20-HETE contribution to hypertension by generating transgenic mice overexpressing the CYP4A12-20-HETE synthase (PT-4a12 mice) under the control of the proximal tubule (PT)-specific promoter, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK). 20-HETE levels in the kidney cortex of male (967±210 vs. 249±69 pg/mg protein), but not female (121±15 vs. 92±11 pg/mg protein) PT-4a12 mice, showed a 2.5-fold increase compared to WT. Renal cortical Cyp4a12 mRNA and CYP4A12 protein in male, but not female PT-4a12 mice increased by 2-3-fold compared to WT. Male PT-4a12 mice displayed elevated BP (142±1 vs. 111±4 mmHg, p<0.0001), whereas BP in females PT-4a12 mice was not significantly different from WT (118±2 vs. 117±2 mmHg; p=0.98). In male PT-4a12 mice, BP decreased when transitioned from a control salt (0.4%) to a low-salt diet (0.075%) from 135±4 to 120±6 mmHg (p<0.01) and increased to 153±5 mmHg (p<0.05) when placed on a high-salt diet (4%). Female PT-4a12 mice did not show changes in BP on either low- or high-salt diet. In conclusion, the expression of Cyp4a12 driven by the PEPCK promoter is sex-specific probably due to its X-linkage. The salt-sensitive hypertension seen in PT-4a12 male mice suggests a potential anti-natriuretic activity of 20-HETE that needs to be further explored.","Gilani, Ankit; Agostinucci, Kevin; Pascale, Jonathan V; Hossain, Sakib; Kandhi, Sharath; Pandey, Varunkumar; Garcia, Victor; Nasjletti, Alberto; Laniado Schwartzman, Michal","American journal of physiology.

While it is not known whether cognitive biases precede or result from addictive behaviour, they likely influence addiction-related decision-making, and may facilitate pathological behaviour. There is evidence that cognitive functions-including those shown to be altered in substance use and addictive disorders-can be influenced by neuromodulation techniques (specifically, transcranial direct current stimulation and transcranial magnetic stimulation). Much of this work has been conducted in healthy populations, however, making it unclear whether these methods can be used effectively to modulate cognitive functioning in individuals with substance use and addictive disorders. The purpose of the current review is to shed light on the potential effectiveness and feasibility of neuromodulation as a means to improve cognitive deficits in substance use disorders. METHODS The review will identify and evaluate studies that have examined the effects of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) or transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) on cognitive task performance in individuals with chronic substance use or dependence. Relevant studies will be identified through searches in PubMed, PsycINFO, Scopus, and Embase, and narrative review will be used to explore evidence that these techniques can be used successfully to modulate cognitive performance in populations exhibiting addictive behaviour. Assessing individual cognitive domains in turn (e.g. risk-taking, impulsivity, attention), we will critically evaluate the validity and reliability of relevant studies and draw conclusions about the strength of evidence for effective use of neuromodulation in that domain. This protocol is not yet registered with PROSPERO. DISCUSSION To determine whether neuromodulation holds promise as an effective treatment for neurocognitive deficits in substance use and addictive disorders, it is essential to look carefully at previous studies using this approach in addiction samples. This review will provide an objective and informative description of what is currently known about the efficacy of these techniques, shed light on the feasibility and potential challenges of using neuromodulation in individuals who exhibit addictive behaviour, and identify the most valuable next steps for future research.","Naish, Katherine R; Vedelago, Lana; MacKillop, James; Amlung, Michael",Systematic reviews,188,27

The posterior nasopharyngeal defect, evident as a wide area of mucosal erosion exposing the clivus centrally, was successfully reconstructed with an anterior serratus muscle-free tissue transfer via both transcervical and endoscopic transnasal approaches utilizing a laparoscopic fixation device, a previously unreported method for free flap inset, to secure the free flap. The patient tolerated this well and no major complications were encountered. At 2-year follow-up, the patient was without signs of cerebrospinal fluid leak or sequelae of infectious complications, including meningitis and osteomyelitis. A combined transcervical and endoscopic transnasal approach using a laparoscopic fixation device for free flap inset can be an effective method to reconstruct posterior nasopharyngeal defects in those patients whom local reconstructive options are not available.","Krane, Natalie A; Troob, Scott H; Wax, Mark K",Microsurgery,188,1

METHODS We retrospectively analysed survival outcomes for patients with biopsy-proven RCC treated by RFA at Westmead Hospital. Complication data were gathered from all patients that underwent renal RFA. 3 and 5 year local recurrence-free (RFS), disease-free (DFS) and overall survival (OS) outcomes were reported. Univariate and multivariate analysis was used to examine each potential predictor. RESULTS A total of 168 patients were eligible for the study. Forty-eight patients with biopsy-proven RCC had minimum 3-year follow-up. Our complication rate was 1.2 % (2/168) and local recurrence rate 10.4 % (5/48). Five-year RFS, DFS and OS were 86.8, 82.3 and 92.6 % on a median 4.1-year follow-up (IQR 3.4-4.9). None of the patient or tumour-specific characteristics were associated with RFS. CONCLUSION Radiofrequency ablation performed at our centre was a safe and effective procedure with low complication rates and durable RFS.

Although he underwent radiotherapy for pain palliation and local tumor control, the pain persisted and the tumor relapsed 3 months after the radiotherapy and he was thought to be at high risk of pathologic fracture. Given hypervascularity and large tumor size, a prophylactic internal fixation combined with adjuvant radiofrequency ablation (RFA) was proposed to reduce blood loss and prevent viable tumor cells being disseminated. His postoperative course was uneventful without requiring blood transfusion and preoperative symptoms immediately disappeared after surgery. He became capable of weight-bearing walk with a single cane and was almost asymptomatic without local progression on the plain radiographs when he died 14 months after surgery. Combination therapy of RFA and internal fixation using intramedullary nailing for metastases of the long bones from HCC seems to be a very promising technique both for sufficient pain relief and for local control of the tumor. Adjuvant RFA may become a potential option for patients with metastases of the long bones for the purpose of prevention of tumor dissemination and reduction of intraoperative blood loss.","Ogura, Koichi; Miyake, Ryoko; Shiina, Shuichiro; Shinoda, Yusuke; Okuma, Tomotake; Kobayashi, Hiroshi; Goto, Takahiro; Nakamura, Kozo; Kawano, Hirotaka",International journal of clinical oncology,188,2

The optimal periprocedural approach in these lesions is still a matter of debate. METHODS Data from the German Stroke Registry-Endovascular Treatment between June 2015 and December 2019 were analyzed. The German Stroke Registry-Endovascular Treatment is an academic, independent, prospective, multicenter, observational registry study with 25 participating stroke centers from all over Germany enrolling consecutive mechanical thrombectomy patients. Tandem lesions were defined as a combination of a relevant extracranial internal carotid artery (ICA) pathology (ipsilateral stenosis >70% or occlusion) and concomitant intracranial large vessel occlusion. Successful reperfusion was defined as modified thrombolysis in cerebral infarction score of 2b-3. The modified Rankin Scale of 0 to 2 at 3 months indicated good outcome. The aim of this study was to investigate the safety and efficacy of different technical strategies in tandem lesions. RESULTS Out of 6635 patients, 874 (13.2%) presented with tandem lesions. Of these, 607 (69.5%) underwent acute treatment of the extracranial ICA. Acute treatment of the extracranial ICA lesion led to a higher probability of successful reperfusion (odds ratio, 40.63 [95% CI, 30.03-70.06]) compared with patients who did not undergo acute treatment of the extracranial ICA lesion and was associated with good clinical outcome (39.5% versus 29.3%, P<0.001) and a lower rate of mortality (17.1% versus 27.1%, P<0.001) at 3 months. Further significant predictors of successful reperfusion were age (odds ratio, 0.98 [95% CI, 0.96-0.99]; P=0.035) and intravenous thrombolysis (odds ratio, 10.58 [95% CI, 10.04-20.4]; P=0.033). Intracranial-first approach (n=227) compared with extracranial-first approach (n=267) resulted in a shorter time to flow restoration (53.5 versus 72.0 minutes, P<0.001) and a higher nonsignificant probability of good outcome (45.8% versus 33.0%, P=0.24) without differences in periprocedural complications. CONCLUSIONS In tandem lesions in the anterior circulation, acute treatment of the extracranial ICA lesion is associated with better clinical outcome and lower mortality. The intracranial-first approach might provide advantages.","Feil, Katharina; Herzberg, Moriz; Dorn, Franziska; Tiedt, Steffen; Küpper, Clemens; Thunstedt, Dennis C; Papanagiotou, Panagiotis; Meyer, Lukas; Kastrup, Andreas; Dimitriadis, Konstantinos; Liebig, Thomas; Dieterich, Marianne; Kellert, Lars",Stroke,188,1

A sufficient supply is essential for the effective production of 200 billion erythrocytes daily, a process called erythropoiesis. AREAS COVERED During infection, the human body can withhold iron from pathogens, mechanism termed nutritional immunity. The subsequent disturbances in iron homeostasis not only impact on immune function and infection control, but also negatively affect erythropoiesis. The complex interplay between iron, immunity, erythropoiesis and infection control on the molecular and clinical level are highlighted in this review. Diagnostic algorithms for correct interpretation and diagnosis of the iron status in the setting of infection are presented. Therapeutic concepts are discussed regarding effects on anemia correction, but also toward their role on the course of infection. EXPERT OPINION In the setting of infection, anemia is often neglected and its impact on the course of diseases is incompletely understood. Clinical expertise can be improved in correct diagnosing of anemia and disturbances of iron homeostasis. Systemic studies are needed to evaluate the impact of specific therapeutic interventions on anemia correction on the course of infection, but also on patients' cardiovascular performance and quality of life.","Valente de Souza, Lara; Hoffmann, Alexander; Weiss, Günter",Expert review of anti-infective therapy,188,1

In this study, we identified coupling between the brain and the heart along the continuum of sedation levels, but not in discrete sedation levels (e. g., wakefulness, conscious sedation, and deep sedation). To identify coupling between the brain and the heart during sedation, we induced several depths of sedation using patient-controlled sedation with propofol and midazolam. We performed electroencephalogram (EEG) spectral analysis and extracted the instantaneous heart rate (HR) from the electrocardiogram (ECG). EEG spectral power dynamics and mean HR were compared along the continuum of sedation levels. We found that EEG sigma power was the parameter most sensitive to changes in the sedation level and was correlated with the mean HR under the effect of sedative agents. Moreover, we calculated the Granger causality (GC) value to quantify brain-heart coupling at each sedation level. Additionally, the GC analysis revealed noticeably different strengths and directions of causality among different sedation levels. In all the sedation levels, GC values from the brain to the heart (GCb→h) were higher than GC values from the heart to the brain (GCh→b). Moreover, the mean GCb→h increased as the sedation became deeper, resulting in higher GCb→h values in deep sedation (1.97 ± 0.18 in propofol, 2.02 ± 0.15 in midazolam) than in pre-sedation (1.71 ± 0.13 in propofol, 1.75 ± 0.11 in midazolam; p < 0.001). These results show that coupling between brain and heart activities becomes stronger as sedation becomes deeper, and that this coupling is more attributable to the brain-heart direction than to the heart-brain direction. These findings provide a better understanding of the relationship between the brain and the heart under specific conditions, namely, different sedation states.","Won, Dong-Ok; Lee, Bo-Ram; Seo, Kwang-Suk; Kim, Hyun Jeong; Lee, Seong-Whan",PloS one,188,1

Here, we review these recent advances in the context of the pleiotropic effects of lactate in regulating diverse functions of immune cells in the tissue microenvironment and under pathological conditions.","Manoharan, Indumathi; Prasad, Puttur D; Thangaraju, Muthusamy; Manicassamy, Santhakumar",Frontiers in immunology,188,20

We systematically reviewed the prognostic impact of transport time in OHCA patients. METHODS We searched PubMed, Embase, the Cochrane Library, and Web of Science from inception to May 2016 for studies that had reported the relationship between transport time and outcome in OHCA patients. The primary outcome was survival at hospital discharge. The secondary outcomes included neurological outcome at hospital discharge and long-term outcome. RESULTS From a total of 3454 titles retrieved from the literature search, 9 studies were included for final analysis. All nine studies (N=46,417) were retrospective observational studies. OHCA patients included were mostly male (61-76%), suffered a witnessed cardiac arrest in half of the cases, and had an initial shockable rhythm in one third of cases. The overall survival to hospital discharge for all cardiac rhythms was less than 6%. There was no evidence for a differential mortality risk in OHCA patients according to transport time (mean difference -0.05min [-0.86,0.76]; I2 25%; 4 studies, 2197 patients). CONCLUSION Paramedic transport time was not associated with survival to hospital discharge or with neurological outcome at hospital discharge in adult OHCA patients. Future studies are needed to prospectively evaluate the prognostic impact of transport time particularly in rural settings and pediatric population.","Geri, Guillaume; Gilgan, Joshua; Wu, Wen; Vijendira, Sandy; Ziegler, Carolyn; Drennan, Ian R; Morrison, Laurie; Lin, Steve",Resuscitation,188,1

Before, peptide binding could only be reliably modelled for a few major human or mouse histocompatibility molecules; now, high-accuracy predictions are available for any human leucocyte antigen (HLA) -A or -B molecule with known protein sequence. Furthermore, peptide binding to MHC molecules from several non-human primates, mouse strains and other mammals can now be predicted. In this review, a number of different prediction methods are briefly explained, highlighting the most useful and historically important. Selected case stories, where these 'reverse immunology' systems have been used in actual epitope discovery, are briefly reviewed. We conclude that this new generation of epitope discovery systems has become a highly efficient tool for epitope discovery, and recommend that the less accurate prediction systems of the past be abandoned, as these are obsolete.","Lundegaard, Claus; Lund, Ole; Buus, Søren; Nielsen, Morten",Immunology,188,24

Here we have identified the receptor-binding domain (RBD) from the MERS-CoV spike protein and determined its crystal structure. This study also presents a structural comparison of MERS-CoV RBD with other coronavirus RBDs, successfully positioning MERS-CoV on the landscape of coronavirus evolution and providing insights into receptor binding by MERS-CoV. Furthermore, we found that MERS-CoV RBD functions as an effective entry inhibitor of MERS-CoV. The identified MERS-CoV RBD may also serve as a potential candidate for MERS-CoV subunit vaccines. Overall, this study enhances our understanding of the evolution of coronavirus RBDs, provides insights into receptor recognition by MERS-CoV, and may help control the transmission of MERS-CoV in humans.","Chen, Yaoqing; Rajashankar, Kanagalaghatta R; Yang, Yang; Agnihothram, Sudhakar S; Liu, Chang; Lin, Yi-Lun; Baric, Ralph S; Li, Fang",Journal of virology,188,11

Lignin is a water-insoluble dietary fiber, but it is second only to cellulose in abundance. Celery is the main source of dietary fiber, but its quality and production are limited by various abiotic stresses. Here, AgNAC1 containing the NAM domain was identified from celery. AgNAC1 was found to be a nuclear protein. Transgenic Arabidopsis thaliana plants hosting AgNAC1 have longer root lengths and stomatal axis lengths than the wide type (WT). The evidence from lignin determination and expression levels of lignin-related genes indicated that AgNAC1 plays a vital role in lignin biosynthesis. Furthermore, the results of the physiological characterization and the drought and salt treatments indicate that AgNAC1-overexpressing plants are significantly resistive to salt stress. Under drought and salt treatments, the AgNAC1 transgenic Arabidopsis thaliana plants presented increased superoxide dismutase (SOD) and peroxidase (POD) activities and decreased malondialdehyde (MDA) content and size of stomatal apertures relatively to the WT plants. The AgNAC1 served as a positive regulator in inducing the expression of stress-responsive genes. Overall, the overexpressing AgNAC1 enhanced the plants' resistance to salt stress and played a regulatory role in lignin accumulation.","Duan, Ao-Qi; Tao, Jian-Ping; Jia, Li-Li; Tan, Guo-Fei; Liu, Jie-Xia; Li, Tong; Chen, Long-Zheng; Su, Xiao-Jun; Feng, Kai; Xu, Zhi-Sheng; Xiong, Ai-Sheng",Genomics,188,19

Understanding the schizophrenia-specific psychosocial barriers and facilitators to smoking cessation is important for designing effective smoking cessation interventions. We aimed to systematically review research examining psychosocial barriers and facilitators to smoking cessation in people living with schizophrenia. Methods: We followed the PRISMA statement to conduct a systematic literature review examining psychosocial barriers and facilitators to smoking cessation in people living with schizophrenia. We searched EMBASE, Medline, PsycINFO, and CINAHL databases from inception to 14 June 2018 to identify relevant articles. We included peer-reviewed original research articles that examined psychosocial barriers and facilitators to smoking cessation, as well as factors associated with maintenance of smoking habits in people living with schizophrenia spectrum disorders. Qualitative, quantitative, or mixed-methods study designs were included. Three authors screened titles, abstracts, and full-texts using the eligibility criteria. We conducted a narrative synthesis of the data to account for the heterogeneity of study designs. We analyzed qualitative and quantitative studies separately. Results: We identified 685 studies from our systematic search and screened the full-text of 134 articles. The final set of 23 articles included 20 quantitative studies and 3 qualitative studies. The most commonly cited barrier to smoking cessation in people living with schizophrenia was cravings and addiction, followed by a perceived increased risk of negative affect associated with quitting smoking. People living with schizophrenia reported smoking to manage stress and to maintain social relationships. People living with schizophrenia were found to be less likely to receive cessation support from health professionals than smokers without schizophrenia. Health concerns were the most commonly mentioned facilitator to quit smoking. Conclusions: People living with schizophrenia experience a wide range of barriers to smoking cessation. The influence of these barriers on smoking cessation likelihood may be greater among people living with schizophrenia than people without psychiatric disorders. Health professionals play an important role in smoking cessation for people living with schizophrenia and should consider barriers and facilitators identified in this review to support quitting in this vulnerable population.","Lum, Alistair; Skelton, Eliza; Wynne, Olivia; Bonevski, Billie",Frontiers in psychiatry,188,20

DESIGN Descriptive, cross-sectional survey. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS Data were collected in 48 isolation facilities in 16 European countries nominated by National Health Authorities for the management of highly infectious diseases (HIDs). METHODS Data were collected through standardized checklists at on-site visits during February-November 2009. Indications for adequate PPE policies were developed on the basis of a literature review, partners' expert opinions, and the collected data. RESULTS All facilities have procedures for the selection of PPE in case of HID, and 44 have procedures for the removal of PPE. In 40 facilities, different levels of PPE are used according to a risk assessment process, and in 8 facilities, high-level PPE (e.g., positive-pressure complete suits or Trexler units) is always used. A fit test is performed at 25 of the 40 facilities at which it is applicable, a seal check is recommended at 25, and both procedures are used at 17. Strategies for promoting and monitoring the correct use of PPE are available at 42 facilities. In case of a sudden increase in demand, 44 facilities have procedures for rapid supply of PPE, whereas 14 facilities have procedures for decontamination and reuse of some PPE. CONCLUSIONS Most isolation facilities devote an acceptable level of attention to PPE selection and removal, strategies for the promotion of the correct use of PPE, and ensuring adequate supplies of PPE. Fit test and seal check procedures are still not widely practiced. Moreover, policies vary widely between and within European countries, and the development of common practice procedures is advisable.","De Iaco, Giuseppina; Puro, Vincenzo; Fusco, Francesco Maria; Schilling, Stefan; Maltezou, Helena C; Brouqui, Philippe; Gottschalk, René; Bannister, Barbara; Brodt, Hans-Reinhard; Siikamaki, Heli; Perronne, Christian; Brantsæter, Arne Broch; Fjellet, Anne Lise; Ippolito, Giuseppe",Infection control and hospital epidemiology,188,17

There are conflicting results as to whether prior intravenous thrombolysis (IVT) facilitates subsequent MT, and data in patients treated with MT alone owing to contraindications to IVT are limited. OBJECTIVE To compare consecutive patients treated with MT alone or with preceding IVT in a large tertiary neurointerventional center, with special emphasis on contraindications to IVT. METHODS Retrospective analysis of 283 consecutive patients with acute ischemic stroke treated with MT in a tertiary neurovascular center over 14 months. Data on characteristics of periprocedural times, recanalization rate, complications, and long-term functional outcome were collected prospectively. RESULTS Information on prior IVT and functional outcome was available in 250 patients. Mean (SD) follow-up period was 5.7 (5.1) months and 105 (42%) patients received both IVT and MT. No significant differences were found in successful recanalization rates (Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction (TICI) 2b/3, 73.8% vs 73.1, p=0.952), complication rates, and long-term favorable outcome (modified Rankin Scale 0-2, 35.2% vs 40%, p=0.444) between patients receiving MT plus IVT and those receiving MT alone. A favorable outcome in patients directly treated with MT alone who were eligible for IVT was achieved in 48.2%. Thrombectomy was safe and resulted in a favorable outcome in 32% of patients with absolute contraindications to IVT. CONCLUSIONS Preceding use of IVT was not an independent predictor of favorable outcome in patients with acute stroke treated with MT and complication rates did not differ whether or not IVT was used. MT is safe and achieved a favorable outcome in one-third of patients with stroke ineligible for IVT.","Weber, Ralph; Nordmeyer, Hannes; Hadisurya, Jeffrie; Heddier, Markus; Stauder, Michael; Stracke, Paul; Berger, Klaus; Chapot, Rene",Journal of neurointerventional surgery,188,20

Methods First, the aerodynamic size distribution and the aerosol output rate were thoroughly characterized. Then, a multimodal approach using magnetic resonance (MR) and gamma-camera (GC) imaging allows to assess the deposition of the aerosolised nanoparticles in the respiratory tract using isolated ventilated porcine lungs. Results The SRP has proven to be radiolabelled by radioisotope with a good yield. Crude SRP or radiolabelled ones showed the same aerodynamic size distribution and output as a conventional molecular tracer, as sodium fluoride. With MR and GC imaging approaches, the nebulised dose represented about 50% of the initial dose of nanoparticles placed in the nebuliser. Results expressed as proportions of the deposited aerosol showed approximately a regional aerosol deposition of 50% of the deposited dose in the lungs and 50% in the upper airways. Each technique assessed a homogeneous pattern of deposited nanoparticles in Lungs. MR observed a strong signal enhancement with the SRP, similar to the one obtained with a commonly used MRI contrast agent, gadoterate meglumine. Conclusion As a known theranostic approach by intravenous administration, SRP appeared to be easily aerosolised with a conventional nebuliser. The present work proves that pulmonary administration of SRP is feasible in a human-like model and allows multimodal imaging with MR and GC imaging. This work presents the proof of concept of SRP nebulisation and aims to generate preclinical data for the potential clinical transfer of SRP for pulmonary delivery.","Montigaud, Yoann; Pourchez, Jérémie; Leclerc, Lara; Tillement, Olivier; Clotagatide, Anthony; Bal, Clémence; Pinaud, Noël; Ichinose, Nobuyasu; Zhang, Bei; Perinel, Sophie; Lux, François; Crémillieux, Yannick; Prevot, Nathalie",International journal of nanomedicine,188,16

They are subjected to global changes with a profound impact on the natural range and viability of animal species, the emergence and spatial distribution of pathogens, land use, ecosystem services and farming sustainability. We urgently need to improve our understanding of how animal populations can respond adaptively and therefore sustainably to these new selective pressures. In this context, we explored the common points between animal production science and animal ecology to identify promising avenues of synergy between communities through the transfer of concepts and/or methodologies, focusing on seven concepts that link both disciplines. Animal adaptability, animal diversity (both within and between species), selection, animal management, animal monitoring, agroecology and viability risks were identified as key concepts that should serve the cross-fertilization of both fields to improve ecosystem resilience and farming sustainability. The need for breaking down interdisciplinary barriers is illustrated by two representative examples: i) the circulation and reassortment of pathogens between wild and domestic animals and ii) the role of animals in nutrient cycles, i.e. recycling nitrogen, phosphorus and carbon through, for example, contribution to soil fertility and carbon sequestration. Our synthesis identifies the need for knowledge integration techniques supported by programmes and policy tools that reverse the fragmentation of animal research toward a unification into a single Animal Research Kinship, OneARK, which sets new objectives for future science policy. At the interface of animal ecology and animal production science, our article promotes an effective application of the agroecology concept to animals and the use of functional diversity to increase resilience in both wild and farmed systems. It also promotes the use of novel monitoring technologies to quantify animal welfare and factors affecting fitness. These measures are needed to evaluate viability risk, predict and potentially increase animal adaptability and improve the management of wild and farmed systems, thereby responding to an increasing demand of society for the development of a sustainable management of systems.","Destoumieux-Garzón, D; Bonnet, P; Teplitsky, C; Criscuolo, F; Henry, P-Y; Mazurais, D; Prunet, P; Salvat, G; Usseglio-Polatera, P; Verrier, E; Friggens, N C",Animal : an international journal of animal bioscience,188,31

Parents are assumed to play an important role in influencing children's PA. Earlier reviews have mainly focused on parental modelling, encouragement, and support for PA, rather than the actual PA levels of parents. Therefore, the purpose of this review was to systematically summarize the evidence on the relationship between parent and child PA. METHODS Papers were identified using electronic databases and manual searches of reference lists. Papers reporting on associations between objectively measured child PA and at least one measure of parental PA were included. The quality of the papers was assessed using a modified version of the ROBINS-I tool. For interpretation of the results across studies, we produced albatross plots for all studies combined and by age-groups, sex of the parents, sex of the child, methodology of assessment of parental PA, and type of PA. RESULTS Thirty-nine papers were included with sample size of parent-child dyads ranging from 15 to 1267 (mean = 319 dyads, median = 227 dyads). The majority of studies were published from 2008 to 2018 and used accelerometry to assess PA. Most of the studies were classified as having moderate, serious, or critical risk of bias. The albatross plot for all studies combined showed that the clear majority of studies observed a positive relationship between parent and child PA. The plot suggested an average magnitude of correlation across studies to be around 0.13, and the overall impression was that this was fairly similar across child age-groups and gender of parent-child dyads. Studies using objective assessment of parental PA showed stronger relationship between parent and child PA compared with studies using self-report (average magnitude of correlation around 0.16 vs 0.04 respectively). No clear evidence was found for the strength of relationship being dependent on type of PA measure of parent and child (total PA, moderate-to-vigorous PA, steps), however, the relationship for light PA appeared weaker. CONCLUSION This systematic review showed that the clear majority of studies observed a weak positive relationship between parent and child PA regardless of age of the child, the gender of the parent-child dyad, and type of PA.

Addition of an immunomodulator has been suggested to reduce immunogenicity, leading to regained response. AIM To investigate whether addition of an immunomodulator to anti-TNF monotherapy could lead to anti-drug antibody suppression and regained clinical response in IBD patients. METHODS We retrospectively collected measurements of infliximab or adalimumab serum concentrations and anti-drug antibodies to identify anti-drug positive patients with loss response who were given an immunomodulator. RESULTS Anti-drug antibodies against infliximab and adalimumab were detected in 98/376 (26%) and in 61/226 (27%) patients, respectively. Immunomodulators were given to 17/159 patients. Clinical response was recaptured in 6/10 patients receiving a thiopurine and in all (7/7) patients receiving methotrexate. In 7/8 patients on infliximab, serum concentrations increased (median 2.84 μg/mL; IQR: 1.19-4.98) and in 6/9 patients on adalimumab (median 3.10 μg/mL; IQR: 1.45-4.45). This was accompanied by a decrease in anti-drug antibodies to undetectable levels (median 11 months for both anti-TNF agents). In 23 patients, no immunomodulator was added but anti-TNF interval was shortened (17/23) or dosage was increased (6/23), which resulted in a clinical response in 10/17 and 2/6 patients, respectively. CONCLUSION In 77% of IBD patients with loss of response due to immunogenicity, addition of immunomodulator resulted in undetectable anti-drug antibody levels, increased serum drug concentrations and regained clinical response. This strategy should be considered in this patient population before switching to other agents.","Strik, A S; van den Brink, G R; Ponsioen, C; Mathot, R; Löwenberg, M; D'Haens, G R",Alimentary pharmacology & therapeutics,188,16

However, the effect of stent design on long-term durability of carotid artery stenting (CAS) is unknown. We compared the medium- to long-term risk of restenosis and ipsilateral stroke between patients treated with open-cell stents versus closed-cell stents in the ICSS (International Carotid Stenting Study). Methods- Patients with symptomatic carotid stenosis were randomized to CAS or endarterectomy and followed with duplex ultrasound for a median of 4.0 years. We analyzed data from patients with completed CAS procedures, known stent design, and available ultrasound follow-up. The primary outcome, moderate or higher restenosis (≥50%) was defined as a peak systolic velocity of >1.3 m/s on ultrasound or occlusion of the treated internal carotid artery and analyzed with interval-censored models. Results- Eight hundred fifty-five patients were allocated to CAS. Seven hundred fourteen patients with completed CAS and known stent design were included in the current analysis. Of these, 352 were treated with open-cell and 362 with closed-cell stents. Moderate or higher restenosis occurred significantly less frequently in patients treated with open-cell (n=113) than closed-cell stents (n=154; 5-year risks were 35.5% versus 46.0%; unadjusted hazard ratio, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.53-0.88). There was no significant difference in the risk of severe restenosis (≥70%) after open-cell stenting (n=27) versus closed-cell stenting (n=43; 5-year risks, 8.6% versus 12.7%; unadjusted hazard ratio, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.37-1.05). The risk of ipsilateral stroke beyond 30 days after treatment was similar with open-cell and closed-cell stents (hazard ratio, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.35-1.75). Conclusions- Moderate or higher restenosis after CAS occurred less frequently in patients treated with open-cell stents than closed-cell stents.

Materials and Methods: This is a single center, observational descriptive study with retrospective analysis. In all cases, the infected prosthetic graft material was completely removed. At discharge, patients were administered anticoagulants. Follow-up examinations included clinical visits, echo-color-Doppler ultrasounds, or computed tomography angiography within 30 days and at 3, 6, and 12 months after the treatment, and then twice per year. Results: We treated 21 patients (90% men, n=19) with the mean age of 71±12 years and mean interval between the initial operation and replacement with CHA of 30 months [range, 1-216; interquartile range (IQR), 2-36]. In-hospital mortality was 14% (n=3); no CHA-related complication led to death. Limb salvage was 100%. No patient was lost at the median follow-up of 14 months (range, 2-61; IQR, 6-39). No rupture, aneurysmal degeneration, or re-infection occurred. Estimated freedom from CHA-related adverse events (95% confidence interval, 43-63) was 95% at 3 years. Conclusion: In our experience, CHAs are a viable option for prosthetic graft infections and provide satisfactory clinical results and favorable stability because of a very low rate of CHA-related adverse events during follow-up.","Bossi, Matteo; Tozzi, Matteo; Franchin, Marco; Ferraro, Stefania; Rivolta, Nicola; Ferrario, Massimo; Guttadauro, Chiara; Castelli, Patrizio; Piffaretti, Gabriele",Annals of vascular diseases,188,20

This study systematically reviews the effects of noninvasive home mechanical ventilation (HMV) on gas exchange, quality of life, survival, and compliance in DM1 patients. METHODS A systematic Medline and Embase search was performed (January 1995 to January 2020). Records were screened for eligibility criteria, data were extracted from included studies, and risk of bias was assessed. We present findings mainly using a narrative synthesis. RESULTS Twenty-eight relevant full-text articles were screened for eligibility criteria. Nine studies were included. Randomized controlled trials were not found. Studies had either an observational (n = 8) or interventional (n = 1) design. In the pooled data analysis, HMV showed to improve mean oxygen saturation with 4.8% and decreased mean carbon dioxide values with 3 mm Hg. Compliance varied widely between studies, from no use to more than 12 h per day. Quality of life was not studied extensively, but some studies reported positive effects of HMV on symptoms of chronic respiratory failure. HMV may improve survival in DM1 patients with chronic hypercapnic respiratory failure. CONCLUSION This review shows that HMV can improve gas exchange and relieve symptoms with a possible survival benefit in DM1 patients with chronic hypercapnic respiratory failure. Future studies should focus on developing strategies to optimize the timing of HMV initiation and to promote compliance.","Vosse, Bettine A H; Seijger, Charlotte; Cobben, Nicolle; van Engelen, Baziel; van Kuijk, Sander M J; Faber, Catharina; Wijkstra, Peter",Respiration; international review of thoracic diseases,188,1

After characterisation, FS-1 showed the following concentrations, representative for medium-strength FS: 12,180 mg TSS L-1, 24,300 mg total COD L-1, 93.8 mg PO3-P L-1, and 325 mg NH4-N L-1. The NO3-N concentration was relatively high (300 mg L-1). For FS-2, the main difference with FS-1 was a lower nitrate concentration (18 mg L-1). The recipes were added consecutively, together with the WW, to an AGS reactor. In the case of FS-1, the system was fed with 7.2 kg total COD m-3d-1 and 0.5 kg Nitrogen m-3d-1. Undesired denitrification occurred during feeding and settling resulting in floating sludge and wash-out. In the case of FS-2, the system was fed with 8.0 kg total COD m-3d-1 and 0.3 kg Nitrogen m-3d-1. The lower NO3-N concentration in FS-2 resulted in less floating sludge, a more stabilised granular bed and better effluent concentrations. To enhance the hydrolysis of the slowly biodegradable particulates from the synthetic FS, an anaerobic stand-by period was added and the aeration period was increased. Overall, when compared to a control AGS reactor, a lower COD consumption (from 87 to 35 mg g-1 VSS h-1), P-uptake rates (from 6.0 to 2.0 mg P g VSS-1 h-1) and NH4-N removal (from 2.5 to 1.4 mg NH4-N g VSS-1 h-1) were registered after introducing the synthetic FS. Approximately 40% of the granular bed became flocculent at the end of the study, and a reduction of the granular size accompanied by higher solids accumulation in the reactor was observed. A considerable protozoa Vorticella spp. bloom attached to the granules and the accumulated particles occurred; potentially contributing to the removal of the suspended solids which were part of the FS recipe.","Barrios-Hernández, Mary Luz; Buenaño-Vargas, Claribel; García, Hector; Brdjanovic, Damir; van Loosdrecht, Mark C M; Hooijmans, Christine M",The Science of the total environment,188,1

METHODS In a randomized parallel trial, 110 patients with clinical stage I endometrial cancer were randomly assigned for laparoscopic staging surgery with (group A, 55) or without (group B, 55) the use of a uterine manipulator (RUMI), between June 2009 and June 2011. Two sets of peritoneal washings were obtained, 1 before and 1 after the insertion of the uterine manipulator. Primary end points were the rates of positive cytology and lymphovascular space invasion. RESULTS No difference was detected in patient characteristics between the groups. Mean operative time, estimated blood loss, and postoperative complications were similar between the groups. Group A had a similar incidence of lymphovascular space invasion compared with group B (12.7% vs 9.1%, respectively; P = 0.761). Four patients (7.3%) in group A had positive peritoneal cytology in the initial washing. One of these patients was classified as stage IIIA. One patient in group B was positive in the second washing. The agreement rate between the 2 sets of washings for both groups was 98.2%. During the median follow-up of 19 months, 6 patients had tumor recurrence without significant difference between the groups. CONCLUSIONS Despite concerns that the use of uterine manipulators may predispose the spread of early-stage disease, insertion of such uterine-manipulating systems did not increase rate of positive peritoneal cytology or lymphovascular space invasion in this study.","Lee, Maria; Kim, Young Tae; Kim, Sang Wun; Kim, Sunghoon; Kim, Jae Hoon; Nam, Eun Ji",International journal of gynecological cancer : official journal of the International Gynecological Cancer Society,188,7

The proportion of vape shops found to be noncompliant with the Governor's executive order (i.e., open) during Stage 1 gradually increased from 54 (61.4%) at Assessment 1 (week of April 1, 2020) to 58 (65.9%) at Assessment 3 (week of April 29, 2020). Moreover, vape shops located in Hispanic/Latino and Korean/Asian communities (vs. those in non-Hispanic White and African American communities) were more likely to stay open both during and after the shutdown at Assessments 1 and 6. More specifically, vape shops located in Hispanic/Latino communities were significantly more likely to offer walk-in service during Assessment 1 (during the shutdown), and vape shops in Hispanic/Latino and Korean/Asian were significantly more likely to offer walk-in service during Assessment 6 (after the re-opening). This study demonstrates high rates of noncompliance with shutdown orders among vape shops located in ethnic communities, thus suggesting higher contextual risk factors of COVID-19 exposure among certain ethnic communities.","Medel, Donna; Galimov, Artur; Meza, Leah; Steinberg, Jane K; Berg, Carla J; Baezconde-Garbanati, Lourdes; Sussman, Steve",Evaluation & the health professions,188,1

This study aims to identify the spatio-temporal pattern of TB incidence rate in Iran between 2008 and 2018. METHODS This cross-sectional study was conducted on aggregated TB data (50,500 patients) at the provincial level provided by the Ministry of Health in Iran between 2008 and 2018. The Anselin Local Moran's I and Getis-Ord Gi* were performed to identify the spatial variations of the disease. Furthermore, spatial scan statistic was employed for purely temporal and spatio-temporal analyses. In all instances, the null hypothesis of no clusters was rejected at p ≤ 0.05. RESULTS The overall incidence rate of TB decreased from 13.46 per 100,000 (95% CI: 13.19-13.73) in 2008 to 10.88 per 100,000 (95% CI: 10.65-11.11) in 2018. The highest incidence rate of TB was observed in southeast and northeast of Iran for the whole study period. Additionally, spatial cluster analysis discovered Khuzestan Province, in the West of the country, having significantly higher rates than neighbouring provinces in terms of both total TB and smear-positive pulmonary TB (SPPTB). Purely temporal analysis showed that high-rate and low-rate clusters were predominantly distributed in the time periods 2010-2014 and 2017-2018. Spatio-temporal results showed that the statistically significant clusters were mainly distributed from centre to the east during the study period. Some high-trend TB and SPPTB statistically significant clusters were found. CONCLUSION The results provided an overview of the latest TB spatio-temporal status In Iran and identified decreasing trends of TB in the 2008-2018 period. Despite the decreasing incidence rate, there is still need for screening, and targeting of preventive interventions, especially in high-risk areas. Knowledge of the spatio-temporal pattern of TB can be useful for policy development as the information regarding the high-risk areas would contribute to the selection of areas needed to be targeted for the expansion of health facilities.","Kiani, Behzad; Raouf Rahmati, Amene; Bergquist, Robert; Hashtarkhani, Soheil; Firouraghi, Neda; Bagheri, Nasser; Moghaddas, Elham; Mohammadi, Alireza",BMC public health,188,1

The best treatment approach to acute stroke in this setting is unknown. We sought to determine clinical outcomes in patients with acute ischemic stroke attributable to ICA occlusion treated with intravenous (IV) systemic thrombolysis or intra-arterial endovascular therapy. METHODS Using the PubMed database, we searched for studies that included patients with acute ischemic stroke attributable to ICA occlusion who received treatment with IV thrombolysis or intra-arterial endovascular interventions. Studies providing data on functional outcomes beyond 30 days and mortality and symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage (sICH) rates were included in our analysis. We compared the proportions of patients with favorable functional outcomes, sICH, and mortality rates in the 2 treatment groups by calculating χ(2) and confidence intervals for odds ratios. RESULTS We identified 28 studies with 385 patients in the IV thrombolysis group and 584 in the endovascular group. Rates of favorable outcomes and sICH were significantly higher in the endovascular group than the IV thrombolysis-only group (33.6% vs 24.9%, P=0.004 and 11.1% vs 4.9%, P=0.001, respectively). No significant difference in mortality rate was found between the groups (27.3% in the IV thrombolysis group vs 32.0% in the endovascular group; P=0.12). CONCLUSIONS According to our systematic review, endovascular treatment of acute ICA occlusion results in improved clinical outcomes. A higher rate of sICH after endovascular treatment does not result in increased overall mortality rate.","Mokin, Maxim; Kass-Hout, Tareq; Kass-Hout, Omar; Dumont, Travis M; Kan, Peter; Snyder, Kenneth V; Hopkins, L Nelson; Siddiqui, Adnan H; Levy, Elad I",Stroke,188,1

DESIGN The study analysed cross-sectional and nationally representative data from 2007 to 2014 Botswana STEPS Surveys and the 2017 Botswana Demographic Survey. SETTING Botswana. PARTICIPANTS Botswana adults aged 25-64 years (n=4003 in 2007, n=2983 in 2014 and n=11 550 in 2017). PRIMARY OUTCOME Underweight and overweight/obesity. RESULTS The prevalence of underweight decreased from 18.1% (95% CI 12.0% to 26.3%) in 2007 to 11.6% (95% CI 9.5% to 13.9%) in 2014 and further dropped to 8.1% (95% CI 7.5% to 8.8%) in 2017. The prevalence of overweight/obesity increased slightly from 37.4% (95% CI 34.3% to 40.7%) in 2007 to 38.6% (95% CI 35.9% to 41.3%) in 2014 to 47.3% (95% CI 46.1% to 48.4%) in 2017. Underweight was more prevalent among males than females while overweight and obesity were more prevalent among females than males. The key risk factor for underweight was being male (adjusted OR (AOR) 2.21: 95% CI 1.80 to 2.72 in 2007, AOR 1.54: 95% CI 1.06 to 2.22 in 2014 and AOR 1.51: 95% CI 1.45 to 1.58 in 2017). For overweight/obesity, the main risk factors were being female (male AOR 0.23: 95% CI 0.15 to 0.35 in 2007, AOR 0.32: 95% CI 0.25 to 0.42 in 2014 and AOR 0.30: 95% CI 0.29 to 0.31 in 2017), being old (AOR 2.18: 95% CI 1.58 to 3.01 in 2007, AOR 2.37: 95% CI 1.71 to 3.29 in 2014) and AOR 2.10: 95% CI 1.94 to 2.27 in 2017 among those aged 55-64 years) and not working (AOR 1.70: 95% CI 1.20 to 2.42 in 2007, AOR 2.05: 95% CI 1.55 to 2.69 in 2014 and AOR 1.34: 95% CI 1.27 to 1.40 in 2017). CONCLUSIONS The findings presented in this study indicate coexistence of the double burden of underweight and overweight/obesity among adults aged 25-64 years in Botswana. Although underweight prevalence is on the decline, overweight/obesity is increasing over time. The problem of underweight and overweight/obesity needs immediate and effective interventions.","Letamo, Gobopamang",BMJ open,188,19

We have recently shown that PD-associated sensory neuropathy in patients is associated with high levels of glucosylceramides. Here, we assessed the underlying pathology and mechanisms in Pink1-/- SNCAA53T double mutant mice. METHODS We studied nociceptive and olfactory behaviour and the neuropathology of dorsal root ganglia (DRGs), including ultrastructure, mitochondrial respiration, transcriptomes, outgrowth and calcium currents of primary neurons, and tissue ceramides and sphingolipids before the onset of a PD-like disease that spontaneously develops in Pink1-/- SNCAA53T double mutant mice after 15 months of age. RESULTS Similar to PD patients, Pink1-/- SNCAA53T mice developed a progressive prodromal sensory neuropathy with a loss of thermal sensitivity starting as early as four months of age. In analogy to human plasma, lipid analyses revealed an accumulation of glucosylceramides (GlcCer) in the DRGs and sciatic nerves, which was associated with pathologic mitochondria, impairment of mitochondrial respiration, and deregulation of transient receptor potential and TRPV and TRPA channels at mRNA, protein and functional levels in DRGs. Direct exposure of DRG neurons to GlcCer caused transient hyperexcitability, followed by a premature decline of the viability of sensory neurons cultures upon repeated GlcCer application. CONCLUSIONS The results suggest that pathological GlcCer contribute to prodromal sensory disease in PD mice via mitochondrial damage and calcium channel hyperexcitability. GlcCer-associated sensory neuron pathology might be amenable to GlcCer lowering therapeutic strategies.","Valek, Lucie; Tran, Bao; Wilken-Schmitz, Annett; Trautmann, Sandra; Heidler, Juliana; Schmid, Tobias; Brüne, Bernhard; Thomas, Dominique; Deller, Thomas; Geisslinger, Gerd; Auburger, Georg; Tegeder, Irmgard",Neuropathology and applied neurobiology,188,8

Without these two drugs, tuberculosis is very difficult and costly to treat, with unacceptably high rates of treatment failure, death, loss to follow-up, and no known preventive treatment. Global attention first focused on MDR TB in the early 1990s when nosocomial outbreaks with high case fatality rates were reported in many countries. Prevalence data for MDR TB on a global scale first became available in 1997. In 2016, about 4.1% of estimated ~10.4 million new TB patients plus 19% of ~1 million previously treated patients, that is ~600,000 people develop MDR TB or rifampicin resistant TB; 250,000 die annually. Ten years ago, <5% of them were diagnosed and enrolled on treatment, increasing to about 21.6% in 2016, leaving much room for improvement. Over that same period of time, momentum has been building to combat MDR TB, including advances in diagnostics, therapeutics, and care; decentralizing patient-centered care coupled with social support; growing improvements in prevention of transmission; increasing use of highly effective antiretroviral treatment; communications, advocacy, and social mobilization; leadership and updated policy guidance. Taking into account long-term epidemiological trends, all of these factors coupled with funding from the Global Fund and other major donors, suggest we may be on the verge of accelerating declines in MDR TB morbidity and mortality. Extreme poverty, which allows tuberculosis to flourish, has actually decreased by about one billion people over the past 25 years. What is needed now is political will on the part of national governments to apply these advances diligently and further reductions in poverty, pushing epidemiological trends past the inflection point to the downward slope. All these can be accelerated with increased support for science leading to better diagnosis, treatment and an effective vaccine to sustain and accelerate the meager declines reported thus far.","Cegielski, J Peter",Revista peruana de medicina experimental y salud publica,188,1

Moreover, to investigate the association between lifestyle changes during the pandemic and sociodemographic characteristics. DESIGN epidemiological investigation based on a cross-sectional study. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS between April 21st and June 7th 2020, an electronic questionnaire to collect information on physical activity, alcohol consumption, smoking, and eating habits during the period of home containment was made available on the web. Respondents were recruited through non-probabilistic snowball sampling. The link to the electronic questionnaire was disseminated through institutional websites, social networks (Facebook, Twitter), and messaging systems such as WhatsApp, Telegram, and SMS. A total of 10,758 interviews were collected, of which 7,847 (73%) were complete for a minimum set of indicators (age, gender, and area of residence). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES reduction of physical activity, increase in alcohol consumption, increase in cigarette smoking, increase in consumption of unhealthy foods (processed meat, red meat or desserts) without increasing healthy foods (vegetables, legumes or whole grains) and, vice versa, increase in consumption of healthy foods without increasing unhealthy foods. RESULTS the population under study consists of 7,847 people with a mean age of 48.6 years (standard deviation: 13.9). Most of respondents are women (71.3%), 92.5% have a high school or university degree and 91% live in Northern Italy. During home containment, 56% of interviewees reported they had reduced the time devoted to physical activity. In particular, this happened among older people and those living in large cities. More than 17% of respondents increased their alcohol consumption, especially men, those highly educated and those living in large urban centres. Older age and residence in the Southern Italy represent, instead, protective factors for this outcome. Among smokers, 30% increased cigarette consumption during the period of home containment, on average of 5.6 cigarettes per day. A small proportion of former smokers (0.6%) resumed smoking. With regard to eating habits, 3 out of 10 respondents (29.9%) reported an inappropriate eating behaviour (increasing unhealthy food without increasing healthy ones). This behaviour was less frequent among men (adjusted Prevalence Ratio 0.80, p=0.005). A lower percentage of respondents (24.5%) increased the consumption of healthy foods without increasing the consumption of unhealthy ones. CONCLUSIONS the results of this survey show that social isolation during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has had an impact on citizens' behaviours. In particular, it was found a noteworthy increase in sedentariness, alcohol consumption, and tobacco smoking. A meaningful proportion of respondents reported a worsening of eating habits, especially among women. However, for each of the behavioural risk factors investigated, small proportions of respondents with resilient attitudes were also found, namely, capable of taking advantage of social isolation for improving their daily habits. Studying changes in lifestyles during a pandemic, identifying population groups most at risk of adopting unfavourable behaviours, is a useful tool for policy makers to plan targeted and effective public health interventions.","Ferrante, Gianluigi; Camussi, Elisa; Piccinelli, Cristiano; Senore, Carlo; Armaroli, Paola; Ortale, Andrea; Garena, Francesca; Giordano, Livia",Epidemiologia e prevenzione,188,19

However, human studies that investigated its glycemic control have generated inconsistent findings. Therefore, this systematic review and meta-analysis is aimed at evaluating the safety and efficacy of M. charantia L. preparations in human studies that have investigated its role in glycemic control. METHODS This protocol has been prepared according to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis Protocols (PRISMA-P). The review will include randomized clinical trials and non-randomized clinical trials. The included studies will have assessed glycemic control of M. charantia preparations with placebo or standard oral anti-hyperglycemic agents in adult pre-diabetes and/or type 2 diabetes mellitus patients and have at least 4 weeks of follow-up. The primary outcomes of review are fasting blood glucose levels, glycosylated hemoglobin A1c, and post-prandial blood glucose level. Electronic database search for published literatures will be conducted without language restriction in EMBASE, MEDLINE/PubMed, the Cochrane Library, SCOPUS, Web of Sciences, and CINAHL databases. Search for gray literatures and references of the retrieved full-text articles will be conducted in Google, Google Scholar, OpenGrey, ProQuest dissertations & Theses, British Library EThos, and university digital library systems. Two independent reviewers will later evaluate full texts, extract data, and assess risk of bias of eligible articles. Publication biases will be assessed by testing asymmetry of funnel plot using Egger's or Begg's tests while heterogeneity will be assessed using Cochran Q test, P value, and I2. Revman software version 5.3 will be used for meta-analysis including subgroup and sensitivity analysis. DISCUSSION This systematic review and meta-analysis will investigate both safety and efficacy of M. charantia preparations in type 2 diabetes mellitus. The review results will be published in a peer-reviewed journal. The results will bring better understanding of clinical outcomes in treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus patients and highlight gaps for future research.

Media interventions could be useful in motivating adolescent girls to feel more efficacious about disclosing sexual assaults. Self-efficacious messages in media that model disclosure behavior could motivate adolescent girls to feel more confident disclosing information about an assault and seeking positive health outcomes. This study used quasi-experimental methods to test the effect of a YouTube vlog containing a self-efficacy message about sexual assault disclosure. Results indicate that exposure to the self-efficacious message leads to higher sexual assault disclosure efficacy among adolescent girls who identify with self-efficacious media characters (B = -.0867, SE = .059, 95% CI [-.2318, -.0033]), albeit indirectly through perceived discrimination of sexual assault victims and approach coping behaviors.

METHODS The data of 60 patients with COVID-19 in Jingzhou Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine and the Second People's Hospital of Longgang District in Shenzhen were extracted using principal component analysis. Factor analysis was used to investigate the factors related to symptoms of COVID-19. Based on the combination of factors, the clinical types of the factors were defined according to our professional knowledge. Factor loadings were calculated, and pairwise correlation analysis of symptoms was performed. RESULTS Factor analysis showed that the clinical symptoms of COVID-19 cases could be divided into respiratory-digestive, neurological, cough-wheezing, upper respiratory, and digestive symptoms. Pairwise correlation analysis showed that there were a total of eight pairs of symptoms: fever-palpitation, coughexpectoration, expectoration-wheezing, dry mouth-bitter taste in the mouth, poor appetite-fatigue, fatiguedizziness, diarrhea-palpitation, and dizziness-headache. CONCLUSIONS The symptoms and syndromes of COVID-19 are complex. Respiratory symptoms dominate, and digestive symptoms are also present.

With nursing vacancy rates averaging 40%, individual countries and the region collectively are challenged to address this issue through the development and implementation of sustainable, feasible strategies. The aim of this scoping review is to examine the amount, type, sources, distribution, and focus of the conceptual and empirical literature on the migration of Caribbean nurses, and to identify gaps in the literature. METHODS Identified records were selected and reviewed using Arksey and O'Malley's scoping framework. A comprehensive search was conducted of eight electronic databases and the Google search engine. Findings were summarized numerically and thematically, with themes emerging through an iterative, inductive process. RESULTS Much of the literature included in our study (N = 6, 33%) originated in the United States. Publications steadily increased between 2003 and 2016, and half of them (N = 9) were journal articles. Many (N = 6, 33%) of the records used quantitative methods. The themes identified were as follows: (1) migration patterns and trends; (2) post-migration experiences; (3) past and present, policies, programs, and practices; and (4) consequences of migration to donor countries. More than half (N = 11, 56%) of the literature addressed nurse migration policies, programs, or practices, either solely or in part. Several gaps were identified including the need for evaluation of the effectiveness of current nurse migration management strategies and to study policies, trends, and impacts in understudied Caribbean countries. CONCLUSION This review demonstrates the need for future research in key areas such as the impact of nurse migration on health systems and population health. The literature tends to focus on Caribbean countries with higher levels of nurse migration. However, data regarding this phenomenon in other Caribbean countries is needed for a more comprehensive understanding of the plight of the Caribbean region and would answer the call from the International Organization for Migration to study policies, trends, and impacts in understudied Caribbean countries.","Rolle Sands, Shamel; Ingraham, Kenchera; Salami, Bukola Oladunni",Human resources for health,188,5

Methods The clinical records of 17 cats diagnosed with thiamine deficiency related to a defective dry food were examined and data collected. The thiamine level in the food was analysed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Results The thiamine level in the food was below the recommendation of the National Research Council. Fifteen cats were fed the food exclusively. Prior to the acute development of neurological signs, most cats displayed non-specific signs such as anorexia, lethargy or vomiting. Vestibular signs of varying severity were observed in 94% of the cats, and all but one of these presented with bilateral dysfunction. Other main neurological signs included altered mentation (76%), blindness (59%) and seizures (59%). Moreover, 80% of the cats with seizures presented with cluster seizures or status epilepticus. MRI abnormalities consistent with findings reported in the previous literature were detected in five cases. MRI was unremarkable in one cat with ongoing severe neurological signs even though thiamine had been administered. Most surviving cats recovered rapidly within 2 weeks of treatment and had either returned to normal or had minimal neurological signs at the 2 month follow-up. One cat recovered slowly over 6 months. Most cats with seizures in the initial stage of the disease remained seizure free at the 24 month follow-up. Conclusions and relevance This study documented the association between feline thiamine deficiency and defective dry food. MRI examination provided valuable information in the diagnosis. However, normal MRI findings do not exclude the diagnosis of feline thiamine deficiency, especially once thiamine has been supplemented. MRI findings also may not always reflect the neurological status or severity. If treated promptly, most cats will recover rapidly with a good outcome. Occasionally, recovery may be slow and take several months.","Chang, Ya-Pei; Chiu, Po-Yu; Lin, Chung-Tien; Liu, I-Hsuan; Liu, Chen-Hsuan",Journal of feline medicine and surgery,188,1

It is found that the effects of asymmetry in the dimer are generally detrimental to the transfer of energy. Four types of systems are examined, arising from combinations of localized trapping, delocalized (Forster) trapping, eigenstate dephasing, and site basis dephasing. In the cases of site basis dephasing, the interplay between the energy gap of the excited dimer states and the environment is shown to give rise to a turnover effect in the efficiency under weak dimer coupling conditions. Furthermore, the nature of the coherences and associated flux is interpreted in terms of pathway interference effects. In addition, regardless of the cases considered, the ratio of the real part and the imaginary part of the coherences in the energy-eigenbasis tends to a constant value in the steady state limit.","Jung, Kenneth A; Brumer, Paul",The Journal of chemical physics,188,14

Due to the emergence and spread of drug resistance to the current antimalarials, malaria-related mortality and incidence rates have recently increased. To overcome the aforementioned obstacles, nano-vehicles based on biodegradable, natural, and non-toxic polymers have been developed. Accordingly, these systems are considered as a potential drug vehicles, which due to their unique properties such as the excellent safety profile, good biocompatibility, tunable structure, diversity, and the presence of functional groups within the polymer structure, could facilitate covalent attachment of targeting moieties and antimalarials to the polymeric nano-vehicles. In this review, we highlighted some recent developments of liposomes as unique nanoscale drug delivery vehiclesand several polymeric nanovehicles, including hydrogels, dendrimers, self-assembled micelles, and polymer-drug conjugates for the effective delivery of antimalarials.","Rashidzadeh, Hamid; Tabatabaei Rezaei, Seyed Jamal; Adyani, Seyed Masih; Abazari, Morteza; Haghighi, Samaneh Rahamooz; Abdollahi, Hossien; Ramazani, Ali",Pharmaceutical development and technology,188,1

Data from a large-scale cross-sectional study of adults in China were analyzed. Outcome measures were the quantity of cigarettes consumed per day prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, the quantity after the nationwide outbreak had been contained, satisfaction with physical health, and emotional well-being. Analyses revealed that, after the nationwide outbreak, more individuals quit (vs. started) smoking. Compared to their pre-COVID-19 consumption levels, smokers significantly reduced the quantity of cigarettes they consumed after the nationwide outbreak had been contained. However, there were substantial disparities across individuals: male (vs. female) smokers were less able to curb their smoking; smokers residing in urban (vs. rural) areas or with a longer smoking history were also less able to reduce their smoking. Importantly, a greater reduction in smoking was associated with higher satisfaction with physical health and better emotional well-being. Furthermore, a follow-up investigation revealed that concerns about increased COVID-19 health risks due to smoking were a primary factor driving smokers' behavior change. Overall, these results suggest that, to help smokers fight tobacco addiction and improve well-being, pandemic health policies need to take account of the differences in vulnerability across individuals and leverage the psychological factors that can facilitate behavior change.","Yang, Haiyang; Ma, Jingjing",Addictive behaviors,188,1

The hemagglutinin envelope protein of influenza plays a critical role in viral entry and thus is an attractive target for inhibition of virus entry. The highly conserved stem loop region of hemagglutinin has been shown to undergo critically important conformational changes during the entry process and, moreover, to be a site for inhibition of virus entry by antibodies, small proteins, and small drug-like molecules. In this work we probe the structure-function properties of the H5 hemagglutinin stem loop region by site-directed mutagenesis. We find that most mutations do not disrupt expression, proteolytic processing, incorporation into virus, or receptor binding; however, many of the mutations disrupt the entry process. We further assess the effects of mutations on inhibition of entry by a neutralizing monoclonal antibody (C179) and find examples of increased and decreased sensitivity to the antibody, consistent with the antibody binding site observed by x-ray crystallography. In addition, we tested the sensitivity of the mutants to MBX2329, a small molecule inhibitor of influenza entry. Interestingly, the mutants exhibit increased and decreased sensitivities to MBX2329, which gives further insight into the binding site of the compound on HA and potential mechanisms of escape. Finally, we have modeled the binding site of MBX2329 using molecular dynamics and find that the resulting structure is in good agreement with the mutagenesis results. Together these studies underscore the importance of the stem loop region to HA function and suggest potential sites for therapeutic intervention of influenza entry.","Antanasijevic, Aleksandar; Basu, Arnab; Bowlin, Terry L; Mishra, Rama K; Rong, Lijun; Caffrey, Michael",The Journal of biological chemistry,188,19

Techniques to enable off-label use of the Sapien XT valve for large-diameter pulmonary and tricuspid valve replacement are described. METHODS Use of the Sapien valve for transcatheter pulmonary and tricuspid valve replacement using both the commercially available Novaflex+ system and using a novel flexible delivery system was reviewed. This customized flexible delivery platform was constructed using the Ensemble sheath and a 30 mm Nucleus balloon. This system was bench tested prior to its clinical use. RESULTS Ten patients had successful implantation of Sapien valves into native right ventricular outflow tracts (RVOTs) (n = 7) or tricuspid valves (n = 3). There was no stenosis or regurgitation after Sapien valve implantation. Several of the pulmonary valve replacement cases were extremely challenging due to the limited flexibility of the Novaflex system. The Sapien valve was crimped onto a 30 mm Nucleus balloon preloaded through an Ensemble sheath. This system was able to consistently deliver the Sapien valve safely in a bench model as well as in native RVOTs in two patients. CONCLUSION The 29 mm Sapien XT valve allows for large-diameter transcatheter valve replacement in both the pulmonary and tricuspid positions. Initial results of new techniques to utilize a more flexible delivery platform are described that could obviate the need for the Novaflex system. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","Levi, Daniel S; Sinha, Sanjay; Salem, Morris M; Aboulhosn, Jamil A",Catheterization and cardiovascular interventions : official journal of the Society for Cardiac Angiography & Interventions,188,1

The current study examined the possibility of an association of parents' employment status with youth injury and the interaction of this status with other socio-economic factors and ethnicity. METHODS We distributed to adolescents aged 11-15 years, in class, the Israel Health Behavior in School-Aged Children Survey. We distinguished between any injury and severe injury, defining the latter as one necessitating the use of a cast, stitches and crutches or overnight hospitalization. RESULTS Of 13 705 respondents, 6224 (45%) had an injury in the past year that required medical treatment and 1827 pupils (13.5%) reported severe injuries. The odds of any injury were 1.86 for boys as against girls (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.73-1.99), 0.80 for school grade (95% CI 0.78-0.82), 1.56 for Arabs vs. Jews (95% CI 1.43-1.70) and 1.10 for high Family Affluence Scale (FAS) vs. medium FAS (95% CI 1.01-1.21). Only in the low FAS group, when two parents were unemployed, the odds for severe injury was 1.36 (95% CI 1.03-1.78); when one or two parents were employed, the odds of severe child injury were the same (OR 1.13 and 95% CI 0.92-1.40). CONCLUSION Factors that were found to increase the risk of injury among youth were parental unemployment, low socio-economic status and Arab ethnicity.

In South Africa (SA), a nationwide lockdown was implemented at midnight on 26 March to prepare for the predicted surge and slow the spread of the virus. OBJECTIVES To compare the volume and type of presentations of trauma secondary to interpersonal violence and road traffic collisions (RTCs) during two 5-month periods, from February to June 2019 and 2020, in the emergency department (ED) of an academic tertiary hospital in Gauteng Province, SA. In 2020, February - June included the lockdown period. METHODS An observational retrospective audit of the patient register at the Helen Joseph Hospital ED was conducted, comparing the number of trauma presentations secondary to interpersonal violence (assaults with gunshot wounds, general assaults including mob assaults, assaults with stab wounds) and RTC presentations between February and June 2019 and 2020. RESULTS A total of 4 300 trauma presentations secondary to interpersonal violence and RTCs were noted in the 5-month period February - June 2019, as opposed to 3 239 presentations in February - June 2020 (25% decline). A 40% decline in the number of RTCs, from 1 704 in February - June 2019 to 1 026 in the corresponding period for 2020, was noted and found to be statistically significant (p=0.03). Declines in the volume of trauma cases secondary to interpersonal violence and of overall trauma cases were only directional in favour of 2020, but not statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS The volume of trauma presentations secondary to interpersonal violence and RTCs in the Helen Joseph Hospital ED decreased during the lockdown period. The decline in the volume of RTCs was statistically significant, but declines in the volume of trauma presentations secondary to interpersonal violence and in the volume of overall trauma presentations were not.","Venter, A; Lewis, C M; Saffy, P; Chadinha, L P",South African medical journal = Suid-Afrikaanse tydskrif vir geneeskunde,188,20

Yet, they remain poorly understood by trainees and surgeons. A single-institution pilot study suggested that structured simulation improves knowledge of the safe use of electrosurgery (ES) among trainees (Madani et al. in Surg Endosc 28(10):2772-2782, 2014). The purpose of this study was to estimate the extent to which the addition of this structured bench-top simulation improves ES knowledge across multiple surgical training programs. METHODS Trainees from 11 residency programs in Canada, the USA and UK participated in a 1-h didactic ES course, based on SAGES' Fundamental Use of Surgical Energy™ (FUSE) curriculum. They were then randomized to one of two groups: an unstructured hands-on session where trainees used ES devices (control group) or a goal-directed hands-on training session (Sim group). Pre- and post-curriculum (immediately and 3 months after) knowledge of the safe use of ES was assessed using separate examinations. Data are expressed as mean (SD) and N (%), *p < 0.05. RESULTS A total of 289 (145 control; 144 Sim) trainees participated, with 186 (96 control; 90 Sim) completing the 3-month assessment. Baseline characteristics were similar between the two groups. Total score on the examination improved from 46% (10) to 84% (10)* for the entire cohort, with higher post-curriculum scores in the Sim group compared with controls [86% (9) vs. 83% (10)*]. All scores declined after 3 months, but remained higher in the Sim group [72% (18) vs. 64% (15)*]. Independent predictors of 3-month score included pre-curriculum score and participation in a goal-directed simulation. CONCLUSIONS This multi-institutional study confirms that a 2-h curriculum based on the FUSE program improves surgical trainees' knowledge in the safe use of ES devices across training programs with various geographic locations and resident volumes. The addition of a structured interactive bench-top simulation component further improved learning.","Madani, Amin; Watanabe, Yusuke; Townsend, Nicole; Pucher, Philip H; Robinson, Thomas N; Egerszegi, Patricia E; Olasky, Jaisa; Bachman, Sharon L; Park, Chan W; Amin, Nalin; Tang, David T; Haase, Erika; Bardana, Davide; Jones, Daniel B; Vassiliou, Melina; Fried, Gerald M; Feldman, Liane S",Surgical endoscopy,188,1

Continuous therapy with intra-arterial calcium channel blockers has been introduced as a new step in the invasive treatment cascade of CV and DCI. Sedation is routinely necessary for this procedure. We report about the feasibility to apply this therapy in awake compliant patients without intubation and sedation. Out of 67 patients with invasive endovascular treatment of cerebral vasospasm due to spontaneous SAH, 5 patients underwent continuous superselective intracarotid nimodipine therapy without intubation and sedation. Complications, neurological improvement, and outcome at discharge were summarized. Very good outcome was achieved in all 5 patients. The Barthel scale was 100 and the modified Rankin scale 0-1 in all cases at discharge. We found no severe complications and excellent neurological monitoring was possible in all cases due to patients' alert status. Symptoms of DCI resolved within 24 h in all 5 cases. We could demonstrate the feasibility and safety of selective intracarotid arterial nimodipine treatment in awake, compliant patients with spontaneous SAH and symptomatic CV and DCI. Using this method, an excellent monitoring of neurological function as well as early detection of other complications is possible. It might be an important step in the risk reduction of invasive CV therapy to improve the outcome with CV and DCI after SAH in selected patients.","Paľa, Andrej; Schneider, Max; Brand, Christine; Pedro, Maria Teresa; Özpeynirci, Yigit; Schmitz, Bernd; Wirtz, Christian Rainer; Kapapa, Thomas; König, Ralph; Braun, Michael",Neurosurgical review,188,1

From the archives of the British Industrial Fatigue Research Board in the pre-World-War I era, to Muscio’s (1921) famous inquiry “is a fatigue test possible?’ [1], the question of assessment has been a perpetual challenge. The lack of accurate assessment is allied to a ready recognition that fatigue plays a critical role in many large-scale disasters as well as errors and incidents of less social prominence, but which are nevertheless equally problematic. In recent decades, in our 24-7-365 world, the issue of operator fatigue continues to impact multiple millions of workers around the world;a propensity that the COVID-19 pandemic has only exacerbated. Yet all is not doom and gloom. Most especially in the 21st century, a number of promising methods and techniques have been offered to provide reliable, quantitative values which specify fatigue levels. Very much like the allied concern for workload assessment [2], the three primary methods of assessment concern primary task performance, physiological assessment approaches, and subjective evaluations. The present work is focused on the latter mode, being arguably the most useful for the prospective projection of future fatigue levels. In short, the issue of fatigue is a large and growing one, its assessment is a crucial ergonomic concern, synthesized subjective assessment techniques promise to provide a vital answer. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Hancock, G.

Manufacturing companies need to coordinate quickly to be able to adjust the disruption. Manufacturing companies already have an integrated information technology system that has been the primary process in Enterprise Resources Planning (ERP). Manufacturing companies make ERP their primary system, so they need to be updated and adjusted as needed. This study obtains a questionnaire from Indonesia's manufacturing industry using the google form link and distributed through social media WhatsApp, Facebook and Instagram. Data processing was carried out by using the partial least square of 285 manufacturing company respondents. The results showed that ERP sustainability was able to influence supply chain integration (internal and external). External integration has an impact on information quality, while internal integration does not affect. Supply chain integration and information quality affect increasing firm performance. Research makes a practical contribution to the industry in optimizing ERP systems in Pandemic conditions and a theoretical contribution to ERP sustainability as a mainstay in supply chain integration. © 2021, Growing Science.

A highly specific lateral flow test kit for SARS-CoV-2 S1 IgG+IgM antibodies was developed as a home-test assay with a LOD at 50IU/mL of pseudovirus neutralizing titer (PVNT). 2. After full vaccination with COVID-19 vaccines, 96.6% of the vaccinees successfully achieved the seroconversion of SARS-CoV-2 S1 IgG+IgM antibody. 3. Even though the S1 antibody level in 88% of the vaccinees vaccinated with inactivated virus vaccines dropped below the detection 2-6 months layer, one boost could quickly raise the S1 antibody titer above 50IU/mL, indicating the initial vaccination was successful and immunization memory was developed. Abstract Background: More than ten novel COVID-19 vaccines have been approved with protections against SARS-CoV-2 infections ranges between 52-95%. It is of great interest to the vaccinees who have received the COVID-19 vaccines, vaccine developers and authorities to identify the non-responders in a timely manner so intervention can take place by either giving additional boosts of the same vaccine or switching to a different vaccine to improve the protection against the SARS-CoV-2 infections. A robust correlation was seen between binding antibody titer and efficacy (p=0.93) in the clinic studies of 7 COVID-19 vaccines, so it is of urgency to develop a simple POCT for vaccinees to self-assess their immune response at home. Methods. Using CHO cell-expressed full length SARS-CoV2 S1 protein as coating antigen on colloidal gold particles, a SARS-CoV-2 S1 IgG-IgM antibody lateral flow test kit (POCT) was developed. The test was validated with negative human sera collected prior to the COVID-19 outbreaks, and blood samples from human subjects prior, during, and post-immunization of COVID-19 vaccines. Results. The specificity of the POCT was 99.0%, as examined against 947 normal human sera and 20 whole blood samples collected pre-immunization. The limit of detection was 50 IU/mL of pseudovirus neutralizing titer (PVNT) using human anti-SARS-2 neutralizing standards from convalescent sera. The sensitivity of POCT for SARS-CoV-2 S1 protein antibody IgG-IgM was compared with SARS-CoV-2 RBD antibody ELISA and determined to be 100% using 23 blood samples from vaccinated human subjects and 10 samples from non-vaccinated ones. Whole blood samples were collected from 119 human subjects (ages between 22-61 years) prior to, during, and post-vaccination of five different COVID-19 vaccines. Among them, 115 people tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 S1 antibodies (showing positive at least once) and 4 people tested negative (tested negative at least twice on different days), demonstrating 96.64% of seroconversion after full-vaccination. 92.3% (36/39) of the human subjects who were younger than 45 achieved seroconversion within 2 weeks while only 57.1% (4/7) of subjects older than 45 tested positive for S1 antibodies, suggesting that younger people develop protection much faster than older ones. Even though the S1 antibody level in 88% of human subjects vaccinated with inactivated virus dropped below 50 IU/mL two months later, one boost could quickly raise the S1 antibody titer above 50 IU/mL of PVNT, indicates that the initial vaccination was successful and immunization memory was developed. Conclusion: Using the lateral flow tests of SARS-CoV2 S1 IgG+IgM, vaccinated human subjects can easily self-assess the efficacy of their vaccination at home. The vaccine developer could quickly identify those non-responders and give them an additional boost to improve the efficacy of their vaccines. Vaccinees who failed in response could switch to different types of COVID-19 vaccines since there are more than 10 COVID-19 vaccines approved using three different platform technologies.","Li, M.; Shan, Y.; Cai, K.; Ren, W.; Sun, H.; Wu, S.; Li, J.; Hong, D.; Zhang, Z.; Wang, Q.; Qin, L.; Sun, Y.; Ye, C.; Jiang, H.; Wang, Z.; Jiang, Y.; Liu, C.; Hu, B.; Chen, R.; Sun, L.",,188,29

These affected a) the health and wellbeing of NHS staff exposed to COVID-19 in the workplace, b) patients, as high risk exposure increases the risk of transmission of the virus, preventing outbreaks within a clinical environment, protecting staffing levels and allowing healthcare services to continue.A system of identification and assessment of staff and their risk from contact with COVID-19 was developed. Using this assessment, staff were advised on action, ranging from no additional action needed, to a swab with no isolation period to full 14 day isolation. There have been positive outcomes since the introduction of the system. At RCHT only 18% of staff whom have had contact with a COVID-19 positive patient or staff member have been required to self-isolate. This is a vast improvement over the potential 100% whom would have had to self-isolate were simple guidance of isolating after any contact followed without exploring the risk further.By the end of April 2020, the contact tracing services in UHPT and RCHT were well established;the only local services in the country at the time. Public Health England (PHE) were kept informed of our policies and aided in some of the finer details. Multiple NHS trusts across the South West have started to implement similar systems working in close collaboration to ensure consistency across the region. Weekly regional meetings now take place virtually between occupational health services across the region, facilitated by the occupational health service at RCHT.

Thus, this study examines the impact of peer-to-peer accommodations on restaurant employment, the antecedents of restaurant choice (chain vs. local restaurant) of peer-to-peer guests, and the impact of COVID-19 regulations on this choice. We used ten years of AirDNA and publicly available restaurant employment earnings data in the U.S. to measure the economic impact of peer-to-peer accommodations on restaurant employment. We surveyed 479 peer-to-peer accommodations guests who had traveled in the last two years and analyzed that data using SEM. Authenticity, perceived value, and star ratings impact the choice of chain or local restaurant. Adherence to COVID-19 regulations impacted this choice and risk perception mediated this decision.

Objective: We conducted this study to derive and validate a new scoring system that can accurately differentiate COVID-19 patients who may have a worse outcome from others at the prehospital stage. Methods: This study was performed on probable/confirmed COVID-19 patients, who were transferred to the hospitals by Tehran emergency medical services (EMS). Occurrence of one of the items including: in-hospital death, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, or hospitalization for more than 20 days was considered to indicate a “severe disease”. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression were used for assessment of the relationship between all independent variables and the outcome. In the validity assessment step, area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was calculated for a data set independent from the data based on which the model was designed. The sensitivity and specificity were also presented based on the best suggested cut-off point. Results: In this study, the data of 557 cases were analyzed in the derivation step and 356 cases were assessed in the validation step. The univariate logistic regression showed that age, weakness and fatigue, disease history, systolic blood pressure, SpO2, respiratory rate, and Glasgow coma scale (GCS) were statistically significant in severe disease group. The area under the ROC curve (AUC-ROC) of the tool was 0.808 (95% CI: 0.779, 0.834). The best cut-off point for screening was the score of ≥4, in which the sensitivity and specificity of the tool for the best cut-off point were 71.87% and 78.06%, respectively.

I propose a model where testing permits isolation of the infected and provides agents with information about the prevalence and lethality of the disease. Additional testing reduces the perceived lethality of the disease, but might increase the perceived risk of infection. As a result, more testing could increase the perceived risk of dying from the disease - i.e. 'stoke fear' - and cause a fall in economic activity, despite improving health outcomes. Two main insights emerge. First, increased testing is beneficial to the economy and pays for itself if performed at a sufficiently large scale, but not necessarily otherwise. Second, heterogeneous risk perceptions across age-groups can have important aggregate consequences. For a SARS-CoV-2 calibration of the model, heterogeneous risk perceptions across young and old individuals mitigate GDP losses by 50% and reduce the death toll by 30% relative to a scenario in which all individuals have the same perceptions of risk.","Furno, F.",,188,16

As a result, many mothers did not feel entitled to seek support with child care from fathers or nonparental caregivers and experienced guilt if they did so.

In this cross-sectional retrospective study, we investigated the immediate and post COVID-19 complications with secondary effects in symptomatic and asymptomatic COVID-19 patients of Bangladesh. A total of 632 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 from December, 2020 to February, 2021 were included in this study. The data were collected by telephone interview with patients consent and reviewing their call records using questionnaire and checklist. Results demonstrate that among the 632 patients, 77.53% of cases were symptomatic, where fever was the most common symptom (82.24%). The other symptoms were headache (58.16%), sore throat (53.65%), cough (45.51%), weakness (41.22%), breathlessness (40%), loss of smell (37.55%), tastelessness (31.84%), diarrhea (19.39%), and vomiting (14.69%). Comorbidities like asthma, hypertension, diabetes mellitus (DM), cardiovascular disease, and other chronic diseases were pronounced in symptomatic patients. Post COVID-19 complications varied significantly (P<0.05) between the symptomatic and asymptomatic observations. Asthma, hypertension, and diabetes were newly reported in symptomatic patients with the rate of 3.06%, 2.45%, and 2.24%, respectively, while the proportions were 1.41%, 1.41%, and 0.70% for the asymptomatic group. Tiredness, weight loss, hair loss, and insomnia were the most observed post COVID-19 complications found higher in symptomatic patients than in asymptomatic groups. A newly developed visual anomaly was also identified in the symptomatic group (1.42%), which was absent in asymptomatic COVID-19 recovered patients. These findings concluded that post-COVID-19 complications were high in symptomatic and comorbid patients compared with asymptomatic individuals.

Treatment has been with glucocorticoids (GCs) alone for many decades but recently Tocilizumab (TCZ) has demonstrated efficacy in reducing GC dose and flare rates in patients with GCA. Therefore, both early diagnosis and regular monitoring are necessary for the correct management of GCA. The COVID-19 pandemic has led to decisions by the governments of the countries involved, aimed above all at reducing the contagion. This has also led to reductions in health activities, limiting them to those of urgency by reducing or canceling checkups involving the risk of a time gap which for the GCA meant the interruption of clinical monitoring and therapeutic adjustment. At the same time, the pandemic situation has stimulated remote monitoring activities, through telephone contacts or video calls carried out by the rheumatologist. EULAR identified a minimal data set aimed at research and for clinical use, which includes the main clinical and instrumental data to be taken into consideration in monitoring the patient. For many data a clinical examination is not necessary but an interview is sufficient. We activated the TELEMACOV protocol (TELEmedicine and Management of the patient affected by giant cell arteritis during the COVid-19 pandemic) monitoring the follow-up of patients affected by GCA through telemedicine tools in order to maintain an effective and risk-free follow-up in a pathology with a high risk of relapse. Objectives: The purpose of the study is to evaluate the effectiveness of telemedicine in the follow-up of the patient with GCA. Methods: We evaluated patients (pts) with a clinical diagnosis of GCA (received in previous periods) who were admitted to the our Rheumatology Unit. They were monitored monthly by telephone from 9 March to 9 June 2020 (during lockdown). All patients were asked questions divided according to the sub-groups listed below: -Onset of new symptoms or their recurrence -Exams carried out -Current therapy -Satisfaction of telephone call Results: We performed 148 remote monitoring visits in 37 pts. The cohort was mainly composed by female (77,8%) and had a mean age of 71,85 ± 9,25 years. They were affected by GCA, with a mean duration of 5,3±2,3 months. The characteristics of these pts and the course of the disease are reported in Table 1. Pts treated with TCZ reduced their GC dose more than patients treated with GC alone (p: 0.032). Only one patient (treated with GC alone) had an ocular flare with the need to increase the dosage of the GC with good response and rapid improvement. Furthermore, all patients considered this type of monitoring very satisfactory according to the Likert scale (1-5) with mean 4,4±0,2. Conclusion: Our study has shown how telemedicine can be well used in pts with GCA as a possible alternative, for a limited period, to traditional visits, especially in a fragile population such as the elderly and more exposed to the risk of SARSCOV2 infection.","Parisi, S.; Ditto, M.

In the practice of plague treatment for thousands of years, Daoist medicine has developed a special etiology of plague that includes Qi-based theories (Qi is considered to be the force that informs and animates all things in Daoism, thus, plague is also considered to be caused by specific and hazardous Qi.) and worm-based theories, forming a strategy of plague control that includes prevention before an epidemic, active treatment during the epidemic, and recovery after the epidemic;these developed plague prevention methods combine isolation, disinfection, and drug use. Additionally, it is the first to practice a primitive immunoprophylaxis method that uses tissues and secretions of infected persons and animals to infect healthy individuals to gain disease immunity. It has formed a plague treatment method mainly based on drug treatment and ritual treatment, supplemented by acupuncture and physical treatment. It has left behind many effective drugs and prescriptions for plague treatment, some of which have a wide clinical application. Hence, Daoist medicine has made great contributions to plague control in Chinese history. Its strategies, methods, medicines, and prescriptions for plague control still have considerable theoretical and application today, especially in the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic.","Peng, B.

Sanitization and reuse of masks can alleviate high mask consumption and production stresses. In the present work, improved sanitization potency of vaporous hydrogen peroxide (VHP) treatment of resilient bacterial spores while retaining polymeric filter performance was explored. A batch fumigation chamber with hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) vapor and ozone (O-3) is featured, followed by intense pulsed light (IPL) flash treatments. A resilient bacterial indicator, Geobacillus stearothermophilus (G. stearothermophilus), was utilized to compare the efficacy of various H2O2 concentrations in combination with O-3 and IPL. It was found that exposure to 30 minutes of 4.01 L min(-1) 0.03% H2O2 aqueous vapor and 3 g h(-1) O-3 followed by 10 IPL flashes per side completely inactivated G. stearothermophilus. The xenon sourced IPL irradiation was found to synergistically enhance radical production and strengthen the complementary biocidal interaction of H2O2 with O-3. Due to the synergistic effects, H2O2 was able to sanitize at a diluted concentration of 0.03% H2O2. The physical properties, such as surface potential, tensile strength, hydrophobicity, and filtration efficiency of >300 nm saline water aerosol of fibrous polypropylene (PP) sheets, were maintained. In addition, no residue of sanitizers was detected, thus confirming the biosafety and applicability of this method to disposable masks. Performance was benchmarked and compared with commercially available processes. The synergistic regime was found to achieve sterilization of G. stearothermophilus at drastically reduced H2O2 concentrations and in ambient conditions relative to commercial methods.","Jeong, R.; Kumar, H.; Jones, S.; Sandwell, A.; Kim, K.; Park, S.

Community-based mental health care options, including mental health provided at the primary health care level are currently limited or absent in the mental health system. Psychosocial support, as well as self-care and mental health promotion are also insufficiently developed. Covid-19 pandemic is serious challenge for health care system, especially for consultation liaison psychiatry.ObjectivesMental health monitoring and psychological support in University Clinic of Kharkiv National Medical University, Ukraine during COVID-19 epidemic.MethodsHADS, SCL-90, HDRS, HARSResultsDuring COVID-19 epidemic, implemented combination of off-line and eye-to-eye methods of mental health monitoring and psychological counselling for patients and medical staff in University clinic of Kharkiv National Medical University.

This pandemic has changed every individual's life, forcing them to adapt to a new normal to survive the deadly disease. With these adjustments, technology has never been more needed than today to stay connected, stay productive, and receive important news. Though people are getting used to the new normal, it is essential to understand technology's role. Resiliency is an important concept to look at during the pandemic. It is crucial to understand how technology has helped individuals, communities, and infrastructures become more resilient. The purpose of this paper is to gain a deeper understanding of resiliency through previous literature. Though resiliency has become a study over the years, it is relatively new in artificial intelligence (AI). By reviewing different resilient models and systems from preceding literature and their impact on various kinds of situations, there will be an understanding of the term resilience and how various frameworks and scales will help create a pandemic management model. Discussing how the various kinds of resilience have helped people and Infrastructure during the pandemic will allow researchers and other professionals to understand resiliency and prepare for future disturbances.

The pandemic has undermined the progress achieved by the subregion towards attaining sustainable development goals. This study argues that fostering environmental sustainability in the South Asian region is crucial to ?Building Back Better? while taking cognisance of future climate-related risks. With the low level of preparedness, the collapse of global supply chains, and restrictive regional integration, the individual country in the region lacks the fiscal and technical capacity to implement sustainable development goals effectively. Therefore, based on the analytical approach to regional integration, this paper explores the potential role of regional integration in ensuring environmental sustainability in South Asia. Additionally, this study illustrates how the COVID-19 pandemic has affected several environmental aspects at the regional level, such as clean energy, disaster risk reduction, and waste management, and shows how regional cooperation can address these challenges post pandemic. While previous studies mainly focus on regional integration in the European Union, this study targets the crucial importance of regional cooperation in South Asia in achieving environmental sustainability.","Jain, Panika Rakshit Bijoy Raina Bisma Bardhan Samaresh",International Social Science Journal,188,26

In this study, we aimed to estimate the VE when combining the ChAdOx1 vaccine as the first dose and an mRNA vaccine as the second dose. Methods: This nationwide population-based cohort study estimated VE against SARS-CoV-2 infection, all-cause and COVID-19 related hospitalization and death after receiving the ChAdOx1 vaccine as the first dose followed by an mRNA vaccine as the second dose. VE estimates were obtained using a Cox regression with calendar time as underlying time and adjusted for sex, age, comorbidity, heritage and hospital admission. Information on all individuals was extracted and linked from high-quality national registries. Results: A total of 5,542,079 individuals were included in the analyses (97.6% of the total Danish population). A total of 144,360 were vaccinated with the ChAdOx1 vaccine as the first dose and of these 136,551 individuals received an mRNA vaccine as the second dose. A total of 1,691,464 person-years and 83,034 cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection were included. The VE against SARS-CoV-2 infection when combining the ChAdOx1 and an mRNA vaccine was 88% (95% confidence interval (CI): 83; 92) 14 days after the second dose and onwards. There were no COVID-19 related hospitalizations and deaths among the individuals vaccinated with the combination of the ChAdOx1 and an mRNA vaccine during the study period. Conclusion: In conclusion, this study found a reduction in the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection when combining the ChAdOx1 and an mRNA vaccine, compared with unvaccinated individuals. This is similar to the VE of two doses of an mRNA vaccine. Longer follow-up time is needed to confirm vaccine induced protection against severe events, such as COVID-19 related hospitalization and death.","Gram, M. A.; Emborg, H.-D.; Moustsen-Helms, I.

DESIGN: This work is based on data collected by the National Child Mortality Database (NCMD) which collates data on all children who die in England. The number of deaths, and their characteristics, from 1st April 2020 until 31st of March 2021 (2020-21), were compared to those from the same period of 2019-20. Relative risk and excess mortality were derived for deaths in 2020-21 vs 2019-20. SETTING: All deaths reported to NCMD in England of children under 18 years of age, between April 2019 and March 2021. PARTICIPANTS: 6490 deaths of children, under the age of 18 years, reported to the NCMD over the study period. RESULTS: Children who died between April 2020 and March 2021 had similar demographics to those who died in 2019-20. Overall, there were 356 (198 to 514) fewer deaths in 2020-21 than in 2019-20 (RR 0.90 (0.85-0.94), p<0.001). Repeating the analysis by category of death, suggested that deaths from infection (RR 0.49 (0.38-0.64)) and from other underlying medical conditions (RR 0.75 (0.68-0.82)) were lower in 2020-21 than 2019-20, and weak evidence (p=0.074) that this was also true of deaths from substance abuse. CONCLUSIONS: Childhood mortality in England during the first year of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic was the lowest on record, with over 300 fewer deaths than the preceding 12 months. The greatest reduction was seen in children less than 10 years old. It is important that we learn from this effect, that potentially offers alternative ways to improve the outcome for the most vulnerable children in our society.","Odd, D.

Policymakers assert that providing public servants with algorithmic advice will improve human risk predictions and thereby lead to better (e.g., fairer) decisions. Yet because many policy decisions require balancing risk-reduction with competing goals, improving the accuracy of predictions may not necessarily improve the quality of decisions. If risk assessments make people more attentive to reducing risk at the expense of other values, these algorithms would diminish the implementation of public policy even as they lead to more accurate predictions. Through an experiment with 2,140 lay participants simulating two high-stakes government contexts, we provide the first direct evidence that risk assessments can systematically alter how people factor risk into their decisions. These shifts counteracted the potential benefits of improved prediction accuracy. In the pretrial setting of our experiment, the risk assessment made participants more sensitive to increases in perceived risk; this shift increased the racial disparity in pretrial detention by 1.9%. In the government loans setting of our experiment, the risk assessment made participants more risk-averse; this shift reduced government aid by 8.3%. These results demonstrate the potential limits and harms of attempts to improve public policy by incorporating predictive algorithms into multifaceted policy decisions. If these observed behaviors occur in practice, presenting risk assessments to public servants would generate unexpected and unjust shifts in public policy without being subject to democratic deliberation or oversight.","Green, Ben; Chen, Yiling",,188,22

Maximizing vaccination requires that we track vaccination patterns to measure the progress of the vaccination campaign and target locations that may be undervaccinated. To improve efforts to track and characterize COVID-19 vaccination progress in the United States, we integrate CDC and state-provided vaccination data, identifying and rectifying discrepancies between these data sources. We find that COVID-19 vaccination coverage in the US exhibits significant spatial heterogeneity at the county level and statistically identify spatial clusters of undervaccination, all with foci in the southern US. Vaccination progress at the county level is also variable; many counties stalled in vaccination into June 2021 and few recovered by July, with transmission of the Delta variant rapidly rising. Using a comparison with a mechanistic growth model fitted to our integrated data, we classify vaccination dynamics across time at the county scale. Our findings underline the importance of curating accurate, fine-scale vaccination data and the continued need for widespread vaccination in the US, especially in the wake of the highly transmissible Delta variant.","Tiu, A.; Susswein, Z.; Merritt, A.; Bansal, S.",,188,1

If an astrophysically compact source, such as a Fast Radio Burst (FRB), is observed through a region with a high optical depth of such microlensing masses, this gravitational lensing time delay can be imprinted on short timescale transient signals. In this paper, we consider the impact of the parity of the macroimage on the resultant microlensing time delays. It is found that this parity is directly imprinted on the microlensing signal, with macroimages formed at minima of the time arrival surface beginning with the most highly magnified microimages and then progressing to the fainter microimages. At macroimages at the maxima of the time arrival surface, this situation is reversed, with fainter images observed first and finishing with the brightest microimages. For macroimages at saddle-points, the signal again begins with fainter images, followed by brighter images before again fading through the fainter microimages. The growing populations of cosmologically distant bursty transient sources will undoubtedly result in the discovery of strong lensed, multiply imaged FRBs, which will be susceptible to microlensing by compact masses. With the temporal resolution being offered my modern and future facilities, the detection of microlensing induced time delays will reveal the parities of the gravitational lens macroimages, providing additional constraints on macrolensing mass models and improving the efficacy of these transient sources as a cosmological probes.","Lewis, Geraint F.",,188,1

Here, we conducted longitudinal analysis over 1.8 million SARS-CoV-2 genomes from 183 countries or territories to capture vaccination-associated viral evolutionary patterns. To augment this macroscale analysis, we performed viral genome sequencing in 23 vaccine breakthrough COVID-19 patients and 30 unvaccinated COVID-19 patients for whom we also conducted machine-augmented curation of the electronic health records (EHRs). Strikingly, we find the diversity of the SARS-CoV-2 lineages is declining at the country-level with increased rate of mass vaccination (n = 25 countries, mean correlation coefficient = -0.72, S.D. = 0.20). Given that the COVID-19 vaccines leverage B-cell and T-cell epitopes, analysis of mutation rates shows neutralizing B-cell epitopes to be particularly more mutated than comparable amino acid clusters (4.3-fold, p < 0.001). Prospective validation of these macroscale evolutionary patterns using clinically annotated SARS-CoV-2 whole genome sequences confirms that vaccine breakthrough patients indeed harbor viruses with significantly lower diversity in known B cell epitopes compared to unvaccinated COVID-19 patients (2.3-fold, 95% C.I. 1.4-3.7). Incidentally, in these study cohorts, vaccinated breakthrough patients also displayed fewer COVID-associated complications and pre-existing conditions relative to unvaccinated COVID-19 patients. This study presents the first known evidence that COVID-19 vaccines are fundamentally restricting the evolutionary and antigenic escape pathways accessible to SARS-CoV-2. The societal benefit of mass vaccination may consequently go far beyond the widely reported mitigation of SARS-CoV-2 infection risk and amelioration of community transmission, to include stemming of rampant viral evolution.","Niesen, M.; Anand, P.; Silvert, E.; Suratekar, R.; Pawlowski, C.; Ghosh, P.; Lenehan, P.; Hughes, T.; Zemmour, D.; OHoro, J.

However, some DMARD targets may impair viral immune defenses. Due to sample size limitations, previous studies of DMARD use and COVID-19 outcomes have combined several heterogeneous rheumatic diseases and medications, investigating a single outcome (e.g., hospitalization). Objectives: To investigate the associations of baseline use of biologic or targeted synthetic (b/ts) DMARDs with a range of poor COVID-19 outcomes in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Methods: We analyzed voluntarily reported cases of COVID-19 in patients with rheumatic diseases in the COVID-19 Global Rheumatology Alliance physician registry (March 12, 2020 -January 6, 2021). We investigated RA treated with b/ tsDMARD at the clinical onset of COVID-19 (baseline): abatacept (ABA), rituximab (RTX), Janus kinase inhibitors (JAK), interleukin-6 inhibitors (IL6i), or tumor necrosis factor inhibitors (TNFi). The outcome was an ordinal scale (1-4) for COVID-19 severity: 1) no hospitalization, 2) hospitalization without oxygen need, 3) hospitalization with any oxygen need or ventilation, or 4) death. Baseline covariates including age, sex, smoking, obesity, comorbidities (e.g., cardiovascular disease, cancer, interstitial lung disease [ILD]), concomitant non-biologic DMARD use, glucocorticoid use/ dose, RA disease activity, country, and calendar time were used to estimate propensity scores (PS) for b/tsDMARD. The primary analysis used PS matching to compare each drug class to TNFi. Ordinal logistic regression estimated ORs for the COVID-19 severity outcome. In a sensitivity analysis, we used traditional multivariable ordinal logistic regression adjusting for covariates without matching. Results: Of the 1,673 patients with RA on b/tsDMARDs at the onset of COVID-19, (mean age 56.7 years, 79.6% female) there were n=154 on ABA, n=224 on RTX, n=306 on JAK, n=180 on IL6i, and n=809 on TNFi. Overall, 498 (34.3%) were hospitalized and 112 (6.7%) died. Among all patients, 353 (25.3%) were ever smokers, 197 (11.8%) were obese, 462 (27.6%) were on glucocorticoids, 1,002 (59.8%) were on concomitant DMARDs, and 299 (21.7%) had moderate/ high RA disease activity. RTX users were more likely than TNFi users to have ILD (11.6% vs. 1.7%) and history of cancer (7.1% vs. 2.0%);JAK users were more likely than TNFi users to be obese (17.3% vs. 9.0%). After propensity score matching, RTX was strongly associated with greater odds of having a worse outcome compared to TNFi (OR 3.80, 95% CI 2.47, 5.85;Figure). Among RTX users, 42 (18.8%) died compared to 27 (3.3%) of TNFi users (Table). JAK use was also associated with greater odds of having a worse COVID-19 severity (OR 1.52, 95%CI 1.02, 2.28). ABA or IL6i use were not associated with COVID-19 severity compared to TNFi. Results were similar in the sensitivity analysis and after excluding cancer or ILD. Conclusion: In this large global registry of patients with RA and COVID-19, baseline use of RTX or JAK was associated with worse severity of COVID-19 compared to TNFi use. The very elevated odds for poor COVID-19 outcomes in RTX users highlights the urgent need for risk-mitigation strategies, such as the optimal timing of vaccination. The novel association of JAK with poor COVID-19 outcomes requires replication.","Sparks, J.; Wallace, Z.; Seet, A.; Gianfrancesco, M.; Izadi, Z.; Hyrich, K.; Strangfeld, A.; Gossec, L.; Carmona, L.; Mateus, E.; Lawson-Tovey, S.; Trupin, L.; Rush, S.; Schmajuk, G.; Katz, P.; Jacobsohn, L.; Al Emadi, S.; Wise, L.; Gilbert, E.; Duarte-Garcia, A.; Valenzuela-Almada, M.; Hsu, T.; D'Silva, K.; Serling-Boyd, N.; Dieudé, P.; Nikiphorou, E.; Kronzer, V.; Singh, N.; Ugarte-Gil, M.

Patients who were scheduled to undergo surgery by a gynecologic oncologist at one of three campuses of a New York City based academic hospital during the ban on elective surgery between March 16, 2020 and June 15, 2020 were included. Patients with benign disease were excluded. Data on patient demographics, perioperative characteristics, nature of surgical delay, and post-operative treatment were abstracted from patient charts. Standard of care was considered met if surgical procedures occurred for suspected malignant and pre-invasive disease, or if an appropriate treatment plan and follow up was documented for malignant cases. Kruskal-Wallis and chi-square test of independence were performed with significance set at p<0.05. A total of 196 patients were scheduled to undergo a surgical procedure during the ban on elective surgery, of which 146 were for malignant, suspected malignant or pre-invasive disease. The majority of cases (42.4%) occurred in patients with known malignancy, followed by suspected malignancy (37.7%) and pre-invasive disease (19.9%). Forty percent of patients experienced one or more surgical delay, 9.6% experienced 2 or more surgical delays and 1.4% experienced three or more surgical delays. Of patients who experienced surgical delays, 75.9% experienced hospital-initiated delays and 24.1% experienced patient-initiated delays. There were no differences between hospital versus patient initiated delays by White vs non-White race (p=0.167). Eight percent of delays were due to a patient with known or suspected COVID-19. The median time from surgical consultation to proposed date of surgery was 20 days for both known malignancy and suspected malignancy, and 34.5 days for pre-invasive disease (p=0.005). Similarly, the median time from surgical consultation to actual date surgery was 23 days for patients with known or suspected malignancy compared to 64 days for preinvasive disease (p=0.011). Of eight patients undergoing treatment for ovarian cancer, 50% underwent primary debulking and 50% underwent neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Among all scheduled cases, the standard of care was met in 89.7% of cases. Standard of care treatment was achieved with a documented alternative plan in 6.1% of cases and with a non-surgical plan in 3% of cases. [Display omitted] During the ban on elective surgery in New York City during the first outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, many patients experienced minor surgical delays, but the majority of patients with known or suspected malignancies obtained appropriate, timely care. Ten percent of patients did not receive standard of care.

The tool-substrate gap is one of the important process parameters which affects ECD machining characteristics such as micro-feature overcut, width, depth, etc. The reported work investigates the effect of the tool-substrate gap on the ECD machining performance with NaOH and KOH electrolytes. A tapered tool with 130 µm average tip size was used to create blind micro-holes in glass substrate with varying tool-substrate gap and machining time. Numerical and experimental results showed a similar decreasing trend of the depth of blind holes as the tool-substrate gap increases. Higher overcut was observed in the case of a tool-substrate gap of 20 µm in the NaOH electrolyte and 10 µm in the KOH electrolyte. The maximum tool-substrate gap up to which machining happened was observed to be 60 µm and 30 µm in the case of the NaOH and KOH electrolytes, respectively. Tool wear was found to be higher when the tool was in physical contact and when the NaOH electrolyte was used for a machining duration of 60s.","Arab, Julfekar; Mishra, Dileep Kumar; Dixit, Pradeep",Procedia Manufacturing,188,1

We conducted a comparative analysis of quarantine durations, testing frequencies, and false-positive rates for all of the 18 RA tests for which emergency use authorization (EUA) has been given by the FDA and a nasopharyngeal RT-PCR test. For each test, we employed a mathematical model of imminent infections to calculate the effective reproductive number in the context of the test used for quarantine or serial testing strategy. We informed the model with data on test specificity and temporal diagnostic sensitivity, convolved with a data-driven profile of COVID-19 infectiousness across the disease time course. Our results demonstrate that the relative effectiveness of RA and RT-PCR tests in reducing post-quarantine transmission depends on the duration of quarantine and the turnaround time of testing results. When quarantines are shorter than five days, our results suggest that an RA test on entry to and on exit from quarantine would reduce onward transmission more than a single RT-PCR test conducted upon exit. Conducting surveillance via serial RT-PCR testing with a 24-h turnaround time, the testing frequency paired with isolation of positives that is required to suppress the effective reproduction number (RE) below one was found to require a minimum frequency of every six days. RA tests reduce RE below one when conducted at a minimum frequency that ranges from every six days to every eight days--depending on the type of RA test--with a median of seven days. Our analysis also highlights that the risk of onward transmission during serial testing increases with the delay in obtaining the results. False-positives were found to be more frequent with RA tests, an issue that could be mitigated with clinical and RT-PCR follow-up. Accounting for the specific diagnostic traits of RA tests, they are an important component of the tool set for policy decision-making, and can serve as a viable alternative to RT-PCR in efforts to control the spread of disease.","WELLS, C.; Pandey, A.; Moghadas, S.; Singer, B.

In order to help maintain high-quality education, a new virtual reality (VR)-based concept for training medical students in rheumatic and musculoskeletal diseases (RMD) has been developed. This VR training concept is based on the integration of real patient data with two-and three-dimensional visualized pathological joints from X-ray and computed tomography generated images. Objectives: To evaluate the practicability and acceptance of the VR training application in the digital curricular education of medical students during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: A short refresher lecture on rheumatic diseases (duration 60 minutes) was followed by presenting the VR training concept to the students. The VR training concept included the demonstration of three virtual patients with early rheumatoid arthritis, rheumatoid arthritis psoriatic arthritis regarding the symptoms, current medical problems, disease patterns at the imaging (conventional radiographs and high-resolution computed tomography) and therapy options. The practicability and acceptance of the VR was evaluated by medical students using a survey. Results: The study encompassed 237 medical students (163 female, 73 male, one diverse, age range 20 to 40 years). 72 % of the participants rated the virtual teaching as good or very good. 87 % presented an expanded knowledge for rheumatoid arthritis and psoriatic arthritis through the VR. Moreover, 91 % reported that the lecture provided a deeper understanding of RMD. Furthermore, 60 % of the students asked for additional courses by VR. Conclusion: The study highlighted the usefulness of innovative VR tools for teaching medical students digitally about RMD. VR applications can be a complementary educational modality for medical students, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic, to provide students with the best possible clinical experience while ensuring that patient, student, and staff safety is not compromised.","Pfeil, A.; Marcus, F.; Hoffmann, T.; Klemm, P.; Oelzner, P.; Müller-Ladner, U.; Hueber, A.; Lange, U.; Wolf, G.; Schett, G.; Simon, D.; Kleyer, A.",Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases,188,19

More than one virus capable of triggering diseases have been identified per year since 1972, which requires the development of new ways of treatment and prevention, however, such processes are not rapid and easy. With the pandemic scenario experienced since early 2020, several drugs with well-known purposes have gained prominence, due to speculation of their use in the treatment against the new coronavirus. Among the main drugs studied, the vast majority contain a heterocyclic structure. In this review, we presented the traditional and efficient synthesis of 15 drugs that have been studied for the COVID-19 treatment, containing in their structure heterocycles like indole, quinoline, pyrimidone, tetrahydrofuran, pyrrolidine, triazole, pyridazine, pyrazole, pyrrolopyrimidine, azetidine, pyrrolotriazine, pyrazine, tetrahydropyran, benzofuran, spiroketal, and thiazole. Furthermore, we have shown the original applications, as well as their structure–activity relationship and what is their situation as a drug candidate against COVID-19. Thus, the objective was to consolidate the main synthetic and pharmacological aspects involving clinically developed heterocycles that at some point were presented as promising against SARS-CoV-2. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.","dos Santos, G.

PBM from BALB/c mice, a strain in which MHV-3 infection results in fatal acute fulminant hepatitis, responds to the virus with a robust PCA response, whereas PBM from C3H/St mice, a strain which develops mild acute hepatitis followed by chronic hepatitis, only exhibit a modest PCA response. In contrast, PBM from A/J mice, a strain fully resistant to MHV-3, generate no increase in PCA above control levels. The induction phase of MHV-3 PCA is rapid, with an increase within 1-1.5 h, with maximum activity at 18h, and it precedes MHV-3 replication in either 17 CL1 cells, a fully permissive cell line, or in monocytes from these strains of mice. The PCA response of BALB/c PBM exceeds the response to any other known stimulus. No induction occurs upon direct stimulation of monocytes by MHV-3, but in the presence of lymphocyte collaboration, the PCA response is observed first at a lymphocyte:monocyte ratio of 2:1 and reaches a maximum as the lymphocyte:monocyte ratio approaches 4:1. This response appears to provide a functional marker for susceptibility to MHV-3 infection in inbred strains of mice and could be important in the pathogenesis of MHV-3-induced disease.",,J Exp Med,188,1

In the present multi-center study, we aimed to assess the differences underlying this association, and ascertain whether ethnicity also mediates other aspects of COVID-19 like cardiovascular complications. METHODS Data were collected from a mixed-ethnicity UK cohort of 613 patients admitted and diagnosed COVID-19 positive, across six hospitals in London during the second half of March 2020: 292 were White Caucasian ethnicity, 203 were Asian and 118 were of Afro-Caribbean ethnicity. RESULTS Caucasian patients were older (P<0.001) and less likely to have hypertension (P=0.038), while Afro-Caribbean patients had higher prevalence of diabetes mellitus (P<0.001). Asian patients were more likely to present with venous thromboembolic disease (adj.OR=4.10, 95% CI 1.49-11.27, P=0.006). On the other hand, Afro-Caribbean had more heart failure (adj.OR=3.64, 95% CI 1.50-8.84, P=0.004) and myocardial injury (adj.OR=2.64, 95% CI 1.10-6.35, P=0.030). Importantly, our adjusted multi-variate Cox regression analysis revealed significantly higher all-cause mortality both for Asian (adj.HR=1.89, 95% CI 1.23-2.91, P=0.004) and Afro-Caribbean ethnicity (adj.HR=2.09, 95% CI 1.30-3.37, P=0.002). CONCLUSIONS Our data show that COVID-19 may have different presentations and follow different clinical trajectories depending on the ethnicity of the affected subject. Awareness of complications more likely to arise in specific ethnicities will allow a more timely diagnosis and preventive measures for patients at risk. Due to increased mortality, individuals of Afro-Caribbean and Asian ethnicity should be considered as high-risk groups. This may have an impact on health-resource allocation and planning, definition of vulnerable groups, disease management, and the protection of healthcare workers at the frontline.","Papageorgiou, Nikolaos; Providencia, Rui; Saberwal, Bunny; Sohrabi, Catrin; Tyrlis, Angelos; Atieh, Abed Elfattah; Lim, Wei-Yao; Creta, Antonio; Khanji, Mohammed; Rusinova, Reni; Chooneea, Bashistraj; Khiani, Raj; Wijesuriya, Nadeev; Chow, Anna; Butt, Haroun; Browne, Stefan; Joshi, Nikhil; Kay, Jamie; Ahsan, Syed",American journal of cardiovascular disease,188,33

DESIGN Data from 2579 patients with COVID-19 admitted to 10 Dutch centers in the period February to July 2020 are described. The clinical data are based on the WHO COVID case record form (CRF) and supplemented with patient characteristics of which recently an association disease severity has been reported. METHODS Survival analyses were performed as primary statistical analysis. These Kaplan-Meier curves for time to (early) death (3 weeks) have been determined for pre-morbid patient characteristics and clinical, radiological and laboratory data at hospital admission. RESULTS Total in-hospital mortality after 3 weeks was 22.2% (95% CI: 20.7% - 23.9%), hospital mortality within 21 days was significantly higher for elderly patients (> 70 years; 35, 0% (95% CI: 32.4% - 37.8%) and patients who died during the 21 days and were admitted to the intensive care (36.5% (95% CI: 32.1% - 41.3%)). Apart from that, in this Dutch population we also see a risk of early death in patients with co-morbidities (such as chronic neurological, nephrological and cardiac disorders and hypertension), and in patients with more home medication and / or with increased urea and creatinine levels. CONCLUSION Early death due to a COVID-19 infection in the Netherlands appears to be associated with demographic variables (e.g. age), comorbidity (e.g. cardiovascular disease) but also disease char-acteristics at admission.","Ariës, Marcel J H; van den Bergh, Joop P; Beudel, Martijn; Boersma, Wim; Dormans, Tom; Douma, Renee; Eerens, Annet; Elbers, Paul W G; Fleuren, Lucas M; Gritters van den Oever, Niels C; de Haan, Lianne; van der Horst, Iwan J C C; Hu, Shi; Hubers, Deborah; Janssen, Marcus L F; de Kruif, Martijn; Kubben, Pieter L; van Kuijk, Sander M J; Noordzij, Peter G; Ottenhoff, Maarten; Piña-Fuentes, Dan A I; Potters, Wouter V; Reidinga, Auke C; Renckens, Roos S C; Rigter, Sander; Rusch, Daisy; Schinkel, Michiel; Sigaloff, Kim C E; Simsek, Suat; Stassen, Patricia; Stassen, Robert; Thomas, Rajat M; van Wingen, Guido A; Vonk Noordegraaf, Anton; Welling, Max; Wiersinga, W Joost; Wolvers, Marije D J; Wyers, Caroline E",Nederlands tijdschrift voor geneeskunde,188,31

Postmortem lung samples were used for agent identification and histopathology. Late in the study, 94 skin samples (ear notches) were tested for Bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) by immunohistochemistry (IHC). Bovine respiratory disease morbidity was 14.7%, and the mortality rate of all causes was 1.3%, with more than half (53.8%) attributed to BRD (0.7% total of all causes). The agents isolated were the following: Mannheimia haemolytica (25.0%), Pasteurella multocida (24.5%), Histophilus somni (10.0%), Arcanobacterium pyogenes (35.0%), Salmonella spp. (0.5%), and Mycoplasma spp. (71.4%). Viruses recovered by cell culture were BVDV-1a noncytopathic (NCP; 2.7%), BVDV-1a cytopathic (CP) vaccine strain (1.8%), BVDV-1b NCP (2.7%), BVDV-2a NCP (3.2%), BVDV-2b CP (0.5%), and Bovine herpesvirus 1 (2.3%). Gel-based polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays were 4.6% positive for Bovine respiratory syncytial virus and 10.8% positive for Bovine coronavirus. Bovine viral diarrhea virus IHC testing was positive in 5.3% of the animals. The mean values were determined for the treatment data: fatal disease onset (32.65 days), treatment interval (29.15 days), number of antibiotic treatments (2.65), number of different antibiotics (1.89), and day of death (61.81 days). Lesions included the following: 1) duration: acute (21%), subacute (15%), chronic (40.2%), healing (2.8%), normal (18.1%), and autolyzed (2.8%); 2) type of pneumonia: lobar bronchopneumonia (LBP; 27.1%), LBP with pleuritis (49.1%), interstitial pneumonia (5.1%), bronchointerstitial pneumonia (1.4%), septic (0.9%), embolic foci (0.5%), other (2.8%), normal (10.3%), and autolyzed (2.8%); and 3) bronchiolar lesions: bronchiolitis obliterans (39.7%), bronchiolar necrosis (26.6%), bronchiolitis obliterans/bronchiolar necrosis (1.4%), other bronchiolar lesions (6.5%), and bronchiolar lesion negative (25.7%). Statistically significant relationships were present among the agents, lesions, and the animal treatment, disease onset, and mortality data. Clinical illnesses observed in this study were lengthier than those reported 16-20 years ago, based on fatal disease onset, treatment interval, and day of death.","Fulton, Robert W; Blood, K Shawn; Panciera, Roger J; Payton, Mark E; Ridpath, Julia F; Confer, Anthony W; Saliki, Jeremiah T; Burge, Lurinda T; Welsh, Ronald D; Johnson, Bill J; Reck, Amy","Journal of veterinary diagnostic investigation : official publication of the American Association of Veterinary Laboratory Diagnosticians, Inc",188,1

Clinical samples were examined by conventional bacterial culture and urinary antigen tests, and 6 bacterial pathogens and 16 respiratory viruses were identified from sputum samples by multiplex polymerase chain reaction assays. The age-group-specific incidence of CAP was estimated using a population-based data set of the total number of outpatients in the whole city. Ninety of the 131 enrolled patients, 68.7% were positive for respiratory pathogens. Streptococcus pneumoniae was the leading bacterial pathogen identified (28.2%). Respiratory viruses were identified in 36 patients (27.5%), and human entero-rhinovirus was the most common (13.3%) among them.

MATERIALS AND METHODS Epidemiological data on all reported cases of rubella and CRS were obtained from the Communicable Diseases Division and Central Claims Processing System, respectively, at the Ministry of Health. Coverage of the childhood immunisation programme against rubella was based on the immunisation data maintained by the National Immunisation Registry, Health Promotion Board. To assess the herd immunity of the population against rubella, 4 serological surveys were conducted from 1989 to 1990, in 1993, 1998 and 2004. RESULTS The incidence of rubella has decreased significantly from the peak of 13.3 per 100,000 population in 1996 to 1.8 per 100,000 in 2007. CRS has virtually disappeared. With more than 92% to 93% of primary school leavers and preschool children annually vaccinated against rubella since 1976 and 1990, respectively, the level of susceptibility to rubella among women in the reproductive age group has gradually decreased from 44% in 1975 to 28% in 1985, and maintained at between 10% and 20% from 1987 to 1998. A considerable proportion (15.8%) of women 18 to 44 years of age remained susceptible to rubella infection in 2004. CONCLUSION Rubella prevention and control has been successfully implemented. However, the relatively high level of susceptibility to rubella among women in the reproductive age group continues to be of concern. More public awareness and health educational efforts are needed and every opportunity should be taken to ensure that all susceptible women are identified and protected against the infection.","Ang, Li Wei; Chua, Lian Tee; James, Lyn; Goh, Kee Tai","Annals of the Academy of Medicine, Singapore",188,1

Analysis of the nucleotide sequences of RT-PCR products revealed 98% homology with the reference strains. Indirect immunofluorescence assay showed a significant presence of green fluorescence, and an average P/N ratio of 7.6 by indirect ELISA assay. Taken together, these tests showed positive isolation of PEDV. Using the virus plaque purification cloning methods established in the test, the purified PEDV large plaque and small plaque were obtained, and the large plaque and small plaque titers were measured with significant difference.

The amino acid sequence of the putative cleavage site, Arg-Arg-Ala-Arg-Arg, was replaced by Arg-Thr-Ala-Leu-Glu by in vitro mutagenesis of the cl-2 S protein cDNA. Recombinant vaccinia viruses containing the cl-2 S cDNA [RVV t(+)] or the mutated cDNA [RVV t(-)] were constructed and monitored for fusion formation and cleavage of the expressed S proteins. When cultured DBT cells were infected with RVV t(+) at a multiplicity of infection of 0.5, fusion formation was first observed at 10 to 12 h postinoculation and spread throughout the whole culture by 20 to 24 h postinoculation. In cells infected with RVV t(-) under the same conditions, fusion formation appeared by 12 to 14 h. This result represented a 2- to 4-h delay in the onset of fusion, compared with its appearance in cells expressing the wild-type S protein. By 25 to 30 h, most of the cells infected by RVV t(-) had fused. By immunoprecipitation and Western blotting (immunoblotting), the 170-kDa S protein was detected in DBT cells expressing the wild-type S protein and the mutated S protein. However, interestingly, the cleavage products of the S protein, S1 and S2, were not detected in RVV t(-)-infected cells, producing the mutated S protein, even though fusion was clearly visible. Both products were, of course, detected in RVV t(+)-infected DBT cells, producing the wild-type S protein. The same results concerning the fusion formation and cleavage properties of the S proteins were reproduced by the transiently expressed S proteins. These results suggest that the cleavage event in the S protein of murine coronavirus JHMV is not a prerequisite for fusion formation but that it does facilitate fusion formation.","Taguchi, F",Journal of virology,188,11

Our studies showed that PV capsids bind to a broad range of cells in culture in a dose-dependent manner. Binding of PV capsids to cells can be blocked by pretreating the cells with the protease trypsin. Penetration of PV into cells was monitored by using complexes in which the purified PV capsids were physically linked to DNA containing the gene for beta-galactosidase driven by the human cytomegalovirus promoter. Expression of beta-galactosidase occurred in < 1% of the cells, and the efficiency of PV receptor-mediated gene delivery was greatly enhanced (up to 10 to 20% positive cells) by the use of a replication-defective adenovirus which promotes endosomal lysis. The data generated by this approach further confirmed the results obtained from the binding assays, showing that PV enter a wide range of cells and that these cells have all functions required for the uptake of PV. Binding and uptake of PV particles can be blocked by PV-specific antisera, and different PV particles compete for particle uptake. Our results suggest that the PV receptor is a conserved cell surface molecule(s) used by different PV and that the tropism of infection by different PV is controlled by events downstream of the initial binding and uptake.","Müller, M; Gissmann, L; Cristiano, R J; Sun, X Y; Frazer, I H; Jenson, A B; Alonso, A; Zentgraf, H; Zhou, J",Journal of virology,188,19

Obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) is a kind of anxiety disorder characterized by a combination of repetitive thoughts and repetitive behaviors for reducing anxiety. We aimed to investigate the frequency of OCD in patients with MS. MATERIALS AND METHODS 112 patients with multiple sclerosis participated in this study. Demographic data were obtained through using patients' medical records. MS clinical subtypes, the duration of disease and neurological signs were determined. The Kurtzke Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) was used to quantify disability in MS, which was confirmed by psychiatrist through using DSM-IV criteria for OCD. The Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS) was used to rate the severity of OCD. Data analysis was performed by SPSS for Windows software (version 15.0) and Chi-square test and Exact test were used for analyzing data. RESULTS The frequency of OCD in patients with MS was 16.1%. The OCD was significantly correlated with a higher EDSS score (X(2) = 86.515, P = 0.0001). OCD was also significantly correlated with the duration of disease, phenotypic subgroup, cranial nerve involvement, cerebellar, autonomic, sensory and motor nerve involvement. CONCLUSIONS OCD might be considered in quantifying disability of patients with MS. It might be suggested that all the patients with MS to be screened for OCD.","Foroughipour, Mohsen; Behdani, Fatemeh; Hebrani, Paria; Marvast, Majid Nabizadeh; Esmatinia, Fereshte; Akhavanrezayat, Amir",Journal of research in medical sciences : the official journal of Isfahan University of Medical Sciences,188,30

One of the reasons is the possibility of infection of the recipient with SARS-CoV-2. Determining the risk of transmission of COVID 19 with a donor organ is very important for developing a kidney transplantation policy during a pandemic. MATERIAL AND METHOD We present cases of kidney transplantation from COVID 19 positive deceased donor to two dialysis patients in single center. Deceased donor: a 45 years old man with diabetes, who had a major hemorrhagic stroke resulting in brain death. He had normal urine output and serum creatinine level for last 24 hours before kidney harvesting. For a few hours after organ harvesting, the donor was diagnosed COVID 19 (retrospective nasopharyngeal swab rRT-PCR which was confirmed by morphological examination and RNA-PCR of specimens from the trachea and bronchus). Recipient 1: a 49 years old man with polycystic kidney disease had been on hemodialysis for 28 months. He was in urgent list because of problems with vascular access. So non identical ABO (0-donor, B-recipient) kidney transplantation from this deceased donor was done in May 2020. Recipient 2: a 45 years old man with polycystic kidney disease on continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD). was registered on urgent waiting list because of low transport capacity of peritoneum. Kidney transplantation from the same deceased donor was done at the same time. In both cases we completely abandoned any antilymphocytic agents for induction, despite non ABO identical transplantation in one of the recipients and the delayed graft function. Both patients received only basic immunosuppression, including tacrolimus, methylprednisolone and a mycophenolic acid. RESULTS In first case cold ischemia time was 22 hours. The recipient had delayed graft function with increasing of urine output on day 8 post-transplant. No other deviations from the usual course were seen during hospital stay. The patient was discharge from hospital with serum creatinine level 122 mkmol/L. The cold ischemia time was 21 hours in another patient. Graft function was immediate with a decrease serum creatinine to 92.5 mkmol/L at discharge. Both patients had no febrile and no other symptoms of acute respiratory disease during all hospital stay. No abnormalities on chest X-ray were seen. No serum anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG were detected before and during 6 weeks after surgery. Repeated nasopharyngeal swabs rRT-PCR were negative during all the period. Both recipients were discharged for 5 weeks after surgery to prevent out-of-hospital contamination of COVID 19, which would be difficult to differentiate from transmission infection. After 9 months both patients are doing well with no clinical or laboratory signs of COVID-19. CONCLUSION Today we have no evidence of the possibility of transmission of COVID-19 from a SARS-Cov-2 positive donor to a kidney recipient. We also have no reason to suspect kidney damage by COVID-19 in a deceased donor at normal serum creatinine level. Avoiding the use of anti-lymphocyte drugs for induction of immunosuppression may also reduce the risk of developing COVID19 after transplantation. A careful collection and analysis of such dates is necessary to develop modern practical recommendations for transplant centers.","Perlin, D V; Alexandrov, I V; Shmanev, A O; A, Terentiev V; Perlina, A V",Urologiia,188,20

The present study aimed to demonstrate the clinical characteristics of patients affected by COVID-19, in our tertiary teaching hospital. Medical records and compiled data of 668 patients with suspected COVID-19 were obtained retrospectively between January to April 2020. The present study outcomes included demographic features of infected patients, underlying diseases and conditions, the relationship between the results of reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) or CT-scan with the manifestations of the disease, mortality rate, and age distribution of fatalities among men and women. The median age of hospitalized patients was 63 years old (from 18 to 94). The patients' chief complaints in the admission time were cough, dyspnea, fever, and gastrointestinal problems, respectively. Hospitalized patients' common comorbidities were hypertension (HTN), and cardiovascular disease (CVD) (24%), diabetes mellitus (DM) (21.5%), asthma, or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (6%), or other underlying diseases (15.5%). One-third of patients had no comorbidity according to the data of medical records. In hospitalized patients, 169 (84.5%) had positive RT-PCR, and 156 (78%) had positive chest CT findings. The mortality rate of males was higher than females (66.3% vs. 33.3%) and in patients with positive RT-PCR compared to patients with positive chest CT-scan findings. The majority of deaths had a history of DM or HTN/CVD in their medical records. The chief complaint of patients was cough. DM and HTN or CVD were the common underlying disease related to death in hospitalized cases. Besides, the hospitalization and mortality rate in males was higher than in females. About 87% of dead hospitalized cases had positive RT-PCR results, and this rate was 82% for chest CT results.","Mostafaei, Ali; Ghojazadeh, Morteza; Hajebrahimi, Sakineh; Abolhasanpour, Nasrin; Salehi-Pourmehr, Hanieh","Iranian journal of allergy, asthma, and immunology",188,1

MERS-CoV has been shown to spread between people who are in close contact. Transmission from infected patients to healthcare personnel has also been observed and is irredeemable with present technology. Genetic studies on MERS-CoV have shown that ORF 1ab encodes replicase polyproteins and play a foremost role in viral infection. Therefore, ORF 1ab replicase polyprotein may be used as suitable target for disease control. Viral activity can be controlled by RNA interference (RNAi) technology, a leading method for post transcriptional gene silencing in a sequence specific manner. However, there is a genetic inconsistency in different viral isolates; it is a great challenge to design potential RNAi (miRNA and siRNA) molecules which can silence the respective target genes rather than any other viral gene simultaneously. In current study four effective miRNA and five siRNA molecules for silencing of nine different strains of MERS-CoV were rationally designed and corroborated using computational methods, which might lead to knockdown the activity of virus. siRNA and miRNA molecules were predicted against ORF1ab gene of different strains of MERS-CoV as effective candidate using computational methods. Thus, this method may provide an insight for the chemical synthesis of antiviral RNA molecule for the treatment of MERS-CoV, at genomic level.","Nur, Suza Mohammad; Hasan, Md Anayet; Amin, Mohammad Al; Hossain, Mehjabeen; Sharmin, Tahmina","Interdisciplinary sciences, computational life sciences",188,19

The clinical benefit of such tools is untested in Asian countries. The aim of this study was to determine the early adverse prognostic factors in patients hospitalized with CAP in Malaysia and to assess the usefulness of the British Thoracic Society (BTS) severity criteria. METHODOLOGY A prospective study was undertaken of all adult patients admitted between August 2002 and March 2003 in an urban-based university teaching hospital. RESULTS One hundred and eight patients (mean +/- SD age 55 +/- 20 years; 58% men) were eligible for the study. Thirteen patients (12%) died in hospital and 95 (88%) survived to hospital discharge. Older age, the presence of chronic illness, severity of comorbidity, reduced oxygen saturation and higher blood urea were associated with mortality during admission. Multivariate logistic regression of these variables identified reduced oxygen saturation as the only independently associated variable. BTS criteria fared poorly in predicting mortality compared with clinical assessment by attending clinicians (36-fold increased risk of death by 'clinical assessment' vs two-threefold by 'BTS criteria'). CONCLUSIONS In hospitalized patients with CAP, certain factors are adversely associated with mortality during admission. Severity criteria validated in specific countries might not be universally applicable.","Loh, Li-Cher; Khoo, Sert-Kim; Quah, Soong-Yuen; Visvalingam, Vanitha; Radhakrishnan, Anuradha; Vijayasingham, Pillai; Thayaparan, Tarmizi",Respirology,188,19

We examined the in vivo antiviral role of both cytokines during coronavirus-induced hepatitis in a mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) model. The absence of IFN-gamma function in mice with a targeted disruption of the IFN-gamma R alpha-chain gene (IFN-gamma R -/-) resulted in increased susceptibility to coronaviral hepatitis associated with augmented viral replication and increased hepatocellular injury. The mutant mice showed a type 1 lymphokine response characterized by the normal high IFN-gamma and low IL-4 production. Unlike MHV-infected wild-type mice, however, the mutant IFN-gamma R -/- mice showed no increase in IL-12 p4O gene expression, similar to that in naive animals. IL-12 treatment failed to restore host resistance in IFN-gamma R -/- mice, but significantly protected MHV-susceptible C57BL/6 mice against lethal infection, although less than IFN-gamma treatment. Mice protected by IL-12 or IFN-gamma showed resistance against an otherwise lethal second MHV infection. Our data demonstrate that despite reduced IL-12 gene expression and defective IFN-gamma R function, virus-induced IFN-gamma production can occur. Furthermore, they emphasize the pivotal antiviral role of IFN-gamma in protection against acute coronavirus-induced hepatitis.","Schijns, V E; Wierda, C M; van Hoeij, M; Horzinek, M C",Journal of immunology,188,28

Studies have forecasted future trends of the incidence of 2019-nCoV infection, but appeared unsuccessful. Farr's law is a classic epidemiology theory/practice for predicting epidemics. Therefore, we used and validated a model based on Farr's law to predict the daily-incidence of 2019-nCoV infection in China and 2 regions of high-incidence. METHODS We extracted the 2019-nCoV incidence data of China, Hubei Province and Wuhan City from websites of the Chinese and Hubei health commissions. A model based on Farr's law was developed using the data available on Feb. 8, 2020, and used to predict daily-incidence of 2019-nCoV infection in China, Hubei Province and Wuhan City afterward. RESULTS We observed 50,995 (37,001 on or before Feb. 8) incident cases in China from January 16 to February 15, 2020. The daily-incidence has peaked in China, Hubei Providence and Wuhan City, but with different downward slopes. If no major changes occur, our model shows that the daily-incidence of 2019-nCoV will drop to single-digit by February 25 for China and Hubei Province, but by March 8 for Wuhan city. However, predicted 75% confidence intervals of daily-incidence in all 3 regions of interest had an upward trend. The predicted trends overall match the prospectively-collected data, confirming usefulness of these models. CONCLUSIONS This study shows the daily-incidence of 2019-nCoV in China, Hubei Province and Wuhan City has reached the peak and was decreasing. However, there is a possibility of upward trend.","Xu, Jie; Cheng, Yajiao; Yuan, Xiaoling; Li, Wei Vivian; Zhang, Lanjing",American journal of translational research,188,30

The initial diagnosis of SARS was based on clinical and epidemiological criteria. During the outbreak, molecular and serologic tests for the SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) became available. However, without a ""gold standard,"" it was impossible to determine the usefulness of these tests. We describe how these tests were used during the first phase of the SARS outbreak in Toronto and offer some recommendations that may be useful if SARS returns. METHODS We examined the results of all diagnostic laboratory tests used in 117 patients admitted to hospitals in Toronto who met the Health Canada criteria for suspect or probable SARS. Focusing on tests for SARS-CoV, we attempted to determine the optimal specimen types and timing of specimen collection. RESULTS Diagnostic test results for SARS-CoV were available for 110 of the 117 patients. SARS-CoV was detected by means of reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) in at least one specimen in 59 (54.1%) of 109 patients. Serologic test results of convalescent samples were positive in 50 (96.2%) of 52 patients for whom paired serum samples were collected during the acute and convalescent phases of the illness. Of the 110 patients, 78 (70.9%) had specimens that tested positive by means of RT-PCR, serologic testing or both methods. The proportion of RT-PCR test results that were positive was similar between patients who met the criteria for suspect SARS (50.8%, 95% confidence interval [CI] 38.4%-63.2%) and those who met the criteria for probable SARS (58.0%, 95% CI 44.2%-70.7%). SARS-CoV was detected in nasopharyngeal swabs in 33 (32.4%) of 102 patients, in stool specimens in 19 (63.3%) of 30 patients, and in specimens from the lower respiratory tract in 10 (58.8%) of 17 patients. INTERPRETATION These findings suggest that the rapid diagnostic tests in use at the time of the initial outbreak lack sufficient sensitivity to be used clinically to rule out SARS. As tests for SARS-CoV continue to be optimized, evaluation of the clinical presentation and elucidation of a contact history must remain the cornerstone of SARS diagnosis. In patients with SARS, specimens taken from the lower respiratory tract and stool samples test positive by means of RT-PCR more often than do samples taken from other areas.","Tang, Patrick; Louie, Marie; Richardson, Susan E; Smieja, Marek; Simor, Andrew E; Jamieson, Frances; Fearon, Margaret; Poutanen, Susan M; Mazzulli, Tony; Tellier, Raymond; Mahony, James; Loeb, Mark; Petrich, Astrid; Chernesky, Max; McGeer, Allison; Low, Donald E; Phillips, Elizabeth; Jones, Steven; Bastien, Nathalie; Li, Yan; Dick, Daryl; Grolla, Allen; Fernando, Lisa; Booth, Timothy F; Henry, Bonnie; Rachlis, Anita R; Matukas, Larissa M; Rose, David B; Lovinsky, Reena; Walmsley, Sharon; Gold, Wayne L; Krajden, Sigmund",CMAJ : Canadian Medical Association journal = journal de l'Association medicale canadienne,188,12

Many special tests (e.g., the Thessaly test with knee flexion at 20° for meniscal tears) can also be translated to a virtual setting by verbally guiding patients through relevant positioning and motions. » Postoperative wound assessment can be performed in the virtual setting by instructing the patient to place a ruler next to the wound for measuring the dimensions and using white gauze for color control. The wound can be visually assessed when the patient's camera or smartphone is positioned 6 to 18 in (15 to 46 cm) away and is held at a 45° angle to the incision.","Emara, Ahmed K; Zhai, Kevin L; Rothfusz, Christopher A; Minkara, Anas A; Genin, Jason; Horton, Scott; King, Dominic; Schaffer, Jonathan L; Piuzzi, Nicolas S",JBJS reviews,188,28

Following an acute febrile course, animals die or recover by the 11th day postinoculation. The characteristic pathologic finding is multifocal myocardial degeneration and necrosis. The disease can be transmitted by various routes with tissue filtrates or with infectious sera diluted to 10(-6) and passed through 0.1 micron filters. Virus particles with morphologic features characteristic of a coronavirus are present in infectious but not in normal rabbit serums. The antigen(s) in the infectious serums cross-reacts with the 229E and the OC43 strains of human coronavirus. Antigen cross-reacting with the 229E virus is detectable by immunofluorescent staining in frozen sections of heart tissue from sick but not from healthy animals. Animals surviving infection seroconvert to coronavirus specificity, as demonstrated by the presence in convalescent serums of antibody capable of reacting with the 339E virus. Susceptibility to infection has not been demonstrated in mice, hamsters, or guinea pigs, and the virus was not adapted for growth in tissue culture. It is uncertain whether the agent is a natural pathogen of rabbits or a coronavirus contaminant from another species, possibly human.

Although the needs of children have been addressed in many of them, in many cases, these initiatives have been inadequate in ensuring the protection of children. In addition, public health and health care system preparedness for terrorism has been broadened to the so-called all-hazards approach, in which response plans for terrorism are blended with plans for a public health or health care system response to unintentional disasters (eg, natural events such as earthquakes or pandemic flu or manmade catastrophes such as a hazardous-materials spill). In response to new principles and programs that have appeared over the last 5 years, this policy statement provides an update of the 2000 policy statement.

In previous work, we demonstrated that infection with the natural rodent pathogen pneumonia virus of mice involves robust virus replication accompanied by cellular inflammation modulated by the CC chemokine macrophage inflammatory protein 1alpha (MIP-1alpha). We found that the antiviral agent ribavirin limited virus replication in vivo but had no impact on morbidity and mortality associated with this disease in the absence of immunomodulatory control. We show here that ribavirin reduces mortality, from 100% to 10 and 30%, respectively, in gene-deleted CCR1(-/-) mice and in wild-type mice treated with the small-molecule chemokine receptor antagonist, Met-RANTES. As MIP-1alpha-mediated inflammation is a common response to several distantly related respiratory virus pathogens, specific antiviral therapy in conjunction with blockade of the MIP-1alpha/CCR1 inflammatory cascade may ultimately prove to be a useful, generalized approach to severe respiratory virus infection and its pathological sequelae in human subjects.","Bonville, Cynthia A; Lau, Vincent K; DeLeon, Jordana M; Gao, Ji-Liang; Easton, Andrew J; Rosenberg, Helene F; Domachowske, Joseph B",Journal of virology,188,1

Mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) and rat coronaviruses are the viruses most frequently encountered in the laboratory animal setting. This review focuses primarily on the cellular and molecular aspects of MHV pathogenesis. The high mutation and recombination rates of coronaviruses lead to a diverse, ever-changing population of MHV strains. The spike (S) protein is the most variable coronavirus protein and is responsible for binding to cell surface receptors, inducing cell fusion and humoral and cellular immunity. Differences within the S protein of different MHV strains have been linked to their variable tropisms. Since immunity to MHV is strain-specific, seropositive mice can be reinfected with different strains of MHV. Natural infections with MHV are acute, with persistence occurring at the population level, not within an individual mouse, unless it is immunocompromised. Age, genotype, immunologic status of the mouse, and MHV strain influence the type and severity of disease caused by MHV. Interference with research by MHV has been reported primarily in the fields of immunology and tumor biology and may be a reflection of MHV's capacity to grow in several types of immune cells. While many methods are available to diagnose coronavirus infection, serologic tests, primarily ELISA and IFA, are the most commonly used. MHV is best managed on a preventive basis. Elimination of MHV from a population requires cessation of breeding and halting the introduction of naive mice into the population.","Compton, S R; Barthold, S W; Smith, A L",Laboratory animal science,188,16

METHODS Two groups of preterm infants (birth weight </= 1500 g) with feeding intolerance were randomized to either low-dose erythromycin (5 mg/kg every 8 hours) or 5% dextrose placebo, both of which were discontinued 1 week after full enteral feedings were tolerated. The primary outcome variable was the time taken to attain full enteral feedings of at least 130 mL/kg/d. RESULTS The gestational age at birth was similar in the two groups (erythromycin, 27.1 +/- 1.9 weeks; placebo, 27.5 +/- 2.9 weeks). The mean birth weight of the erythromycin group was lower (806.3 +/- 215.6 g) than the placebo group (981.4 +/- 285.4 g; P = 0.18), and included more infants who were small for gestational age (4/13 = 31% versus 1/11 = 9%; P = 0.224). There was no difference between the two groups with regard to the volume of feedings they were receiving at the time of enrollment. Reduction in symptoms of gastroesophageal reflux was similar in the two groups. 3 of 13 in the erythromycin group and 4 of 11 in the placebo group improved during the study (P = 0.565). The mean time to attain full enteral feedings after enrollment was 24.9 + 2.9 days in the erythromycin group and 30.8 +/- 4.1 days in the placebo group, a difference that did not reach statistical significance (P = 0.17). CONCLUSIONS Low-dose erythromycin did not reduce the time taken to attain full enteral feedings in preterm infants with very low birth weight and feeding intolerance. Gastroesophageal reflux decreased as a consequence of maturation of the gastrointestinal tract and not because of erythromycin. These preliminary results justify verification in larger multicenter trials.","Ng, Steven Chin-Yuen; Gomez, Joseph Manuel; Rajadurai, Victor Samuel; Saw, Seang-Mei; Quak, Seng-Hock",Journal of pediatric gastroenterology and nutrition,188,16

Despite the Brazilian national guideline protecting breastfeeding practices, there are many concerns about protecting infants from their infected mothers. This study aimed to analyze how the Brazilian hospitals and maternity services promote and support mothers suspected or diagnosed with coronavirus disease (COVID-19). METHODS: This is a descriptive cross-sectional and multicenter study which collected data from 24 Brazilian hospitals and maternity services between March and July 2020. Representatives of the institutions completed a questionnaire based on acts to promote and support breastfeeding, the Baby-Friendly Hospital Initiative, and Brazil's federal law recommendations. RESULTS: The results showed that in delivery rooms, 98.5% of the services prohibited immediate and uninterrupted skin-to-skin contact between mothers and their infants and did not support mothers to initiate breastfeeding in the first hour. On the postnatal ward, 98.5% of the services allowed breastfeeding while implementing respiratory hygiene practices to prevent transmission of COVID-19. Companions for mothers were forbidden in 83.3% of the hospitals. Hospital discharge was mostly between 24 and 28 h (79.1%); discharge guidelines were not individualized. Additionally, a lack of support was noticed from the home environment's health community network (83.3%). Hospital and home breast pumping were allowed (87.5%), but breast milk donation was not accepted (95.8%). There was a lack of guidance regarding the use of infant comforting strategies. Guidelines specific for vulnerable populations were not covered in the material evaluated. CONCLUSIONS: In Brazil, hospitals have not followed recommendations to protect, promote, and support breastfeeding during the COVID-19 outbreak. The disagreement between international guidelines has been a major issue. The absence of recommendations on breastfeeding support during the pandemic led to difficulties in developing standards among hospitals in different regions of Brazil and other countries worldwide. The scientific community needs to discuss how to improve maternal and infant care services to protect breastfeeding in the current pandemic.","Gonçalves-Ferri, Walusa Assad; Pereira-Cellini, Fábia Martins; Coca, Kelly; Aragon, Davi Casale; Nader, Paulo; Lyra, João Cesar; do Vale, Maryneia Silva; Marba, Sérgio; Araujo, Katiaci; Dias, Laura Afonso; de Lima Mota Ferreira, Daniela Marques; Nieto, Gislayne; Anchieta, Lêni Marcia; de Cássia Silveira, Rita; de Moura, Marta David Rocha; Tuma Calil, Valdenise Martins L; Moraes, Viviane Christina Cortez; de Almeida, João Henrique Carvalho Leme; Magalhães, Maurício; Sonini, Thaise Cristina Branchee; Javorsky, Juliane Barleta; Ribeiro, Érica Lobato Acaui; Ferreira, Rodrigo; de Almeida, Louise Dantas Cavalcante; Garbers, Rosângela; da Silva Faria, Gabriella Maset; Roosch, Anelise; de Mesquita, Ana Ruth Antunes; de Oliveira Pinto, Rebecca Meirelles",Int Breastfeed J,188,24

PRRSV helicase nsp10 is an important component of the replication transcription complex that plays a crucial role in viral replication, making nsp10 an important target for drug development. Here, we report the first crystal structure of full-length nsp10 from the arterivirus PRRSV, which has multiple domains: an N-terminal zinc-binding domain (ZBD), a 1B domain, and helicase core domains 1A and 2A. Importantly, our structural analyses indicate that the conformation of the 1B domain from arterivirus nsp10 undergoes a dynamic transition. The polynucleotide substrate channel formed by domains 1A and 1B adopts an open state, which may create enough space to accommodate and bind double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) during unwinding. Moreover, we report a unique C-terminal domain structure that participates in stabilizing the overall helicase structure. Our biochemical experiments also showed that deletion of the 1B domain and C-terminal domain significantly reduced the helicase activity of nsp10, indicating that the four domains must cooperate to contribute to helicase function. In addition, our results indicate that nidoviruses contain a conserved helicase core domain and key amino acid sites affecting helicase function, which share a common mechanism of helicase translocation and unwinding activity. These findings will help to further our understanding of the mechanism of helicase function and provide new targets for the development of antiviral drugs.IMPORTANCE Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) is a major respiratory disease agent in pigs that causes enormous economic losses to the global swine industry. PRRSV helicase nsp10 is a multifunctional protein with translocation and unwinding activities and plays a vital role in viral RNA synthesis. Here, we report the first structure of full-length nsp10 from the arterivirus PRRSV at 3.0-Å resolution. Our results show that the 1B domain of PRRSV nsp10 adopts a novel open state and has a unique C-terminal domain structure, which plays a crucial role in nsp10 helicase activity. Furthermore, mutagenesis and structural analysis revealed conservation of the helicase catalytic domain across the order Nidovirales (families Arteriviridae and Coronaviridae). Importantly, our results will provide a structural basis for further understanding the function of helicases in the order Nidovirales.","Shi, Yuejun; Tong, Xiaohan; Ye, Gang; Xiu, Ruixue; Li, Lisha; Sun, Limeng; Shi, Jiale; Li, Mengxia; Song, Yunfeng; Fan, Chengpeng; Shi, Ke; Fu, Zhen F; Xiao, Shaobo; Peng, Guiqing",J. virol,188,16

Morris",14.524979,6.203817,2021,"Coronavirus Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV-2) is a very recent viral infection and has generated one of the world's biggest problems of all time. There is no scientific evidence and clinical trials to indicate that possible therapies have shown results in suspected or confirmed patients other than the use of immunizations. Given the above, some substances are being studied to be applied to contain their spread and further damage. This work aims to perform an in silico study of amoxicillin, widely known as an antibiotic and used to prevent bacterial infections and a possible biomarker made from a complex with Europium (Eu). It was shown to have the ability to interact with the COVID-19 protein in Mpro protease as ligands. The study was conducted using the AutoDock Vina with Lamarckian genetic model algorithm (GA) combined with the estimation of grid-based energy in rigid and flexible conformation. Compared to affinity energy, amoxicillin presented − 7. 7 kcal/mol, which was better than its co-crystallized ligand in the study. The Europium complex, where its synthesis was also demonstrated in this work, presented energy of − 6. 3 kcal/mol with hydrogen bonds and possible color change when UV light was applied. For the choice of the best poses in the simulation, the neural network parameter, NNScore2, was used. It can be affirmed that this study is still introductory but promising both in the treatment and identification of the virus.

We examined the independent association between d-dimer and death in critically ill patients with coronavirus disease 2019. DESIGN: Multicenter cohort study. SETTING: ICUs at 68 hospitals across the United States. PATIENTS: Critically ill adults with coronavirus disease 2019 admitted to ICUs between March 4, 2020, and May 25, 2020, with a measured d-dimer concentration on ICU day 1 or 2. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The primary exposure was the highest normalized d-dimer level (assessed in four categories: < 2×, 2-3.9×, 4-7.9×, and &#8805; 8× the upper limit of normal) on ICU day 1 or 2. The primary endpoint was 28-day mortality. Multivariable logistic regression was used to adjust for confounders. Among 3,418 patients (63.1% male; median age 62 yr [interquartile range, 52-71 yr]), 3,352 (93.6%) had a d-dimer concentration above the upper limit of normal. A total of 1,180 patients (34.5%) died within 28 days. Patients in the highest compared with lowest d-dimer category had a 3.11-fold higher odds of death (95% CI, 2.56-3.77) in univariate analyses, decreasing to a 1.81-fold increased odds of death (95% CI, 1.43-2.28) after multivariable adjustment for demographics, comorbidities, and illness severity. Further adjustment for therapeutic anticoagulation did not meaningfully attenuate this relationship (odds ratio, 1.73; 95% CI, 1.36-2.19). CONCLUSIONS: In a large multicenter cohort study of critically ill patients with coronavirus disease 2019, higher d-dimer levels were independently associated with a greater risk of death.","Short, Samuel A P; Gupta, Shruti; Brenner, Samantha K; Hayek, Salim S; Srivastava, Anand; Shaefi, Shahzad; Singh, Harkarandeep; Wu, Benjamin; Bagchi, Aranya; Al-Samkari, Hanny; Dy, Rajany; Wilkinson, Katherine; Zakai, Neil A; Leaf, David E",Crit Care Med,188,29

Although South Korea has drastically reduced the number of new confirmed cases and is stabilizing the situation with its exemplary disease prevention policies, there remains a problem. These are cases that had shown negative results to polymerase chain reaction (PCR) (gene amplification) tests as the COVID-19 virus had become undetectable but turned re-positive after a short period. The Central Clinical Committee determined that these re-positive cases after COVID-19 viral clearance are due to the limits of the test method; it is considered that the genetic material of the ""dead virus"" remaining in a recovered patient's body is amplified during the test process. Comprehending the above evidence, re-positive cases of COVID-19 are not infectious; the virus is not even reactivated. However, further research is required as we lack research results on this subject. Until we can be sure, social distancing and other such policies should be maintained.","Kang, Yun-Jung",Disaster Med Public Health Prep,188,16

Recent clinical guidelines have supported the use of corticosteroids or remdesivir in the treatment of COVID-19. However, uncertainty remains about which patients are most likely to benefit from treatment with either drug; such knowledge is crucial for avoiding preventable adverse effects, minimizing costs, and effectively allocating resources. This study presents a machine-learning system with the capacity to identify patients in whom treatment with a corticosteroid or remdesivir is associated with improved survival time. METHODS: Gradient-boosted decision-tree models used for predicting treatment benefit were trained and tested on data from electronic health records dated between December 18, 2019, and October 18, 2020, from adult patients (age &#8805;18 years) with COVID-19 in 10 US hospitals. Models were evaluated for performance in identifying patients with longer survival times when treated with a corticosteroid versus remdesivir. Fine and Gray proportional-hazards models were used for identifying significant findings in treated and nontreated patients, in a subset of patients who received supplemental oxygen, and in patients identified by the algorithm. Inverse probability-of-treatment weights were used to adjust for confounding. Models were trained and tested separately for each treatment. FINDINGS: Data from 2364 patients were included, with men comprising slightly more than 50% of the sample; 893 patients were treated with remdesivir, and 1471 were treated with a corticosteroid. After adjustment for confounding, neither corticosteroids nor remdesivir use was associated with increased survival time in the overall population or in the subpopulation that received supplemental oxygen. However, in the populations identified by the algorithms, both corticosteroids and remdesivir were significantly associated with an increase in survival time, with hazard ratios of 0.56 and 0.40, respectively (both, P = 0.04). IMPLICATIONS: Machine-learning methods have the capacity to identify hospitalized patients with COVID-19 in whom treatment with a corticosteroid or remdesivir is associated with an increase in survival time. These methods may help to improve patient outcomes and allocate resources during the COVID-19 crisis.","Lam, Carson; Siefkas, Anna; Zelin, Nicole S; Barnes, Gina; Dellinger, R Phillip; Vincent, Jean-Louis; Braden, Gregory; Burdick, Hoyt; Hoffman, Jana; Calvert, Jacob; Mao, Qingqing; Das, Ritankar",Clin. ther,188,32

Currently, extended RAS and BRAF mutation testing is obligatory in routine clinical practice before starting any treatment in the metastatic setting. Treatment decision making also includes assessment of the clinical condition of the patient, definition of the treatment goal, and consideration of the primary tumor site. Biological treatment is part of the first-line drug combination unless contraindicated. Mutational status is significantly associated with the outcome of patients and is strongly predictive for anti-EGFR-targeted therapy. The prognosis of RAS mutant CRC is clearly inferior to wild-type cases. RAS remains an elusive target, and specific treatment options are not yet available. Recently, promising results of a direct KRAS G12C inhibitor have been reported; however, further confirmation is needed.

The problems existed in teachers, parents, and mainly students. Most teachers faced problems in creating interactive education materials and conducting an evaluation. Parents had hard times in assisting their children due to their busy activities and low pedagogical competence. Children had hard times due to limited resources for online learning.

Animals were randomly divided into 3 groups (n=10/group) and treated orally with water (0.2ml - group 1) or selenium (25µg/day -group 2; 50µg/day - group 3) for 28 and 56days, respectively. Thereafter, blood samples were collected and estimated for glucose, alkaline-phosphate (ALP), gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT) and aspartate-aminotransferase (AST). Liver homogenates were analyzed for PGC-1&#945; and G6Pase activity. Significant dose-dependent increases in blood glucose, hepatic PGC-1&#945; and G6Pase activities were observed on days 28 and 56 in selenium groups compared to group 1. Serum GGT activity increased in both selenium groups on day 28 however, on day 56 values in group 2 were reduced and increased in group 3, respectively. Compared to control ALP reduced in selenium groups while AST was not significantly different. This study suggests that selenium supplementation increases hepatic peroxisome-proliferator-activated-receptor-gamma-coactivator-1&#945; and glucose-6-phosphatase activity leading to a likely increase in hepatic glucose output. It also shows that though selenium supplementation at the doses used maybe nontoxic to hepatocytes, it may however exert potential toxicity on the biliary tract.","Ige, Abayomi O; Fatokun, B P; Emediong, I E; Odetola, A O; Adele, Bernard O; Adewoye, Elsie O",Niger J Physiol Sci,188,32

METHODS: MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Web of Science were searched for original studies describing sleep abnormalities in children and adolescents with or without pre-existing neurobehavioral disorders during the COVID-19 pandemic. The pooled estimates for various sleep abnormalities were calculated using a random-effect model. RESULTS: Of 371 articles screened, 16 studies were included. Among these, five studies were in preschool children, two were in children with pre-existing neurobehavioral disorders and the remaining were in school going children and adolescents. The outcome measures used for sleep were markedly heterogeneous across the studies. The pooled prevalence of any sleep disturbance in children during the pandemic was 54%(95%CI:50-57%). Interestingly, the prevalence in pre-school children was lower than pre-pandemic times (RR = 0.87; 95% CI:0.58-1.30) but this was not statistically significant. The pooled prevalence of children not meeting sleep recommendation was 49% (95%CI: 39-58%). CONCLUSION: The prevalence of sleep problems in children and adolescents during the COVID-19 pandemic is alarming. Pre-school children had a trend towards relatively fewer sleep disturbances due to home confinement measures in comparison with pre-pandemic times. Sleep duration recommendations were not met in nearly half of healthy children. However, these conclusions need to be seen in light of limited literature on the topic, few included studies done in heterogenous populations, and dubious quality of inferences drawn from these studies which were predominantly online surveys.

SARS-CoV-2 possesses an almost 30kbp long genome. The genome contains open-reading frame 1ab (ORF1ab) gene, the largest one of SARS-CoV-2, encoding polyprotein PP1ab and PP1a responsible for viral transcription and replication. Several vaccines have already been approved by the respective authorities over the world to develop herd immunity among the population. In consonance with this effort, RNA interference (RNAi) technology holds the possibility to strengthen the fight against this virus. Here, we have implemented a computational approach to predict potential short interfering RNAs including small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) and microRNAs (miRNAs), which are presumed to be intrinsically active against SARS-CoV-2. In doing so, we have screened miRNA library and siRNA library targeting the ORF1ab gene. We predicted the potential miRNA and siRNA candidate molecules utilizing an array of bioinformatic tools. By extending the analysis, out of 24 potential pre-miRNA hairpins and 131 siRNAs, 12 human miRNA and 10 siRNA molecules were sorted as potential therapeutic agents against SARS-CoV-2 based on their GC content, melting temperature (Tm), heat capacity (Cp), hybridization and minimal free energy (MFE) of hybridization. This computational study is focused on lessening the extensive time and labor needed in conventional trial and error based wet lab methods and it has the potential to act as a decent base for future researchers to develop a successful RNAi therapeutic.","Hasan, Mahedi; Ashik, Arafat Islam; Chowdhury, Md Belal; Tasnim, Atiya Tahira; Nishat, Zakia Sultana; Hossain, Tanvir; Ahmed, Shamim",Inform Med Unlocked,188,24

Among these is p53, a key gatekeeper for cell division and survival that also regulates innate immune responses. This review summarizes the strategies used by different viruses and discusses the mechanisms deployed by SARS-CoV to target p53 activities. RECENT FINDINGS: We propose a typology for the strategies used by different viruses to address p53 functions: hit and run (e.g. IAV, ZIKV), hide and seek (e.g. HIV1), kidnap and exploit (e.g. EBV, HSV1), dominate and suppress (e.g. HR HPV). We discuss the mechanisms by which SARS nsp3 protein targets p53 for degradation and we speculate on the significance for Covid-19 pathogenesis and risk of cancer. SUMMARY: p53 may operate as an intracellular antiviral defense mechanism. To circumvent it, SARS viruses adopt a kidnap and exploit strategy also shared by several viruses with transforming potential. This raises the question of whether SARS infections may make cells permissive to oncogenic DNA damage.","Cardozo, Camila Martin; Hainaut, Pierre",Curr Opin Oncol,188,24

It is not well understood how hospitals have managed VTE prevention and the effect of prevention strategies on mortality. Objective: To characterize frequency, variation across hospitals, and change over time in VTE prophylaxis and treatment-dose anticoagulation in patients hospitalized for COVID-19, as well as the association of anticoagulation strategies with in-hospital and 60-day mortality. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cohort study of adults hospitalized with COVID-19 used a pseudorandom sample from 30 US hospitals in the state of Michigan participating in a collaborative quality initiative. Data analyzed were from patients hospitalized between March 7, 2020, and June 17, 2020. Data were analyzed through March 2021. Exposures: Nonadherence to VTE prophylaxis (defined as missing &#8805;2 days of VTE prophylaxis) and receipt of treatment-dose or prophylactic-dose anticoagulants vs no anticoagulation during hospitalization. Main Outcomes and Measures: The effect of nonadherence and anticoagulation strategies on in-hospital and 60-day mortality was assessed using multinomial logit models with inverse probability of treatment weighting. Results: Of a total 1351 patients with COVID-19 included (median [IQR] age, 64 [52-75] years; 47.7% women, 48.9% Black patients), only 18 (1.3%) had a confirmed VTE, and 219 (16.2%) received treatment-dose anticoagulation. Use of treatment-dose anticoagulation without imaging ranged from 0% to 29% across hospitals and increased over time (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 1.46; 95% CI, 1.31-1.61 per week). Of 1127 patients who ever received anticoagulation, 392 (34.8%) missed 2 or more days of prophylaxis. Missed prophylaxis varied from 11% to 61% across hospitals and decreased markedly over time (aOR, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.82-0.97 per week). VTE nonadherence was associated with higher 60-day (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 1.31; 95% CI, 1.03-1.67) but not in-hospital mortality (aHR, 0.97; 95% CI, 0.91-1.03). Receiving any dose of anticoagulation (vs no anticoagulation) was associated with lower in-hospital mortality (only prophylactic dose: aHR, 0.36; 95% CI, 0.26-0.52; any treatment dose: aHR, 0.38; 95% CI, 0.25-0.58). However, only the prophylactic dose of anticoagulation remained associated with lower mortality at 60 days (prophylactic dose: aHR, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.51-0.90; treatment dose: aHR, 0.92; 95% CI, 0.63-1.35). Conclusions and Relevance: This large, multicenter cohort of patients hospitalized with COVID-19, found evidence of rapid dissemination and implementation of anticoagulation strategies, including use of treatment-dose anticoagulation. As only prophylactic-dose anticoagulation was associated with lower 60-day mortality, prophylactic dosing strategies may be optimal for patients hospitalized with COVID-19.","Vaughn, Valerie M; Yost, Monica; Abshire, Chelsea; Flanders, Scott A; Paje, David; Grant, Paul; Kaatz, Scott; Kim, Tae; Barnes, Geoffrey D",JAMA Netw Open,188,16

The disease severity is seen to be associated with increasing age and underlying comorbid conditions. Obesity, responsible for various metabolic disorders, appears to be a risk factor in determining the severity of infection despite any age group. Though this association is clinically relevant, the mechanisms underlying are not fully elucidated. SARS CoV2 enters host cell via Angiotensin Converting Enzyme 2 receptor, expression of which is upregulated in visceral fat tissue in obese people, underscoring the fact that adipose tissue is a potential reservoir for virus. Adipose tissue is also a source of many proinflammatory mediators and adipokines. High baseline C-Reactive Protein, interleukin 6, hyperleptinemia with Leptin resistance and hypoadiponectinemia associated with obesity explains the preexisting inflammatory state in obese individuals which predisposes them to worse outcomes and fatality.","Banerjee, Mithu; Gupta, Shruti; Sharma, Praveen; Shekhawat, Jyoti; Gauba, Kavya",Indian J Clin Biochem,188,9

We evaluated echocardiographic correlates of transplant-free survival, re-intervention, and left ventricular (LV) function in mid-term follow-up. METHODS: This retrospective, single-center study included all infants with CAS who underwent Ross by 1 year of age from 1/2000 to 9/2018. Serial echocardiograms were analyzed for LV ejection fraction (EF) and systolic and diastolic longitudinal strain (LS). The primary outcome was mortality or transplant; secondary outcomes were re-intervention and abnormal LVEF (&#8804;55%). RESULTS: In 40 infants (30 [75%] male; median age at Ross 51 days) with median follow-up 3.3 years (interquartile range 1.0-9.4), the primary outcome was met in 11/40 (28%). Transplant-free survival was 79%, 77%, and 69% at 1, 5, and 10 years post Ross. Predictors of transplant or death included neonatal surgery, cross-clamp time, and pre-operative left atrial dilatation and lower LVEF. Median freedom from re-intervention was at 7.1 years post Ross, with no identified associations. LV LS improved 1 year post-Ross (-21.1±3.8% vs. -17.4±5.1%, p=0.02), although LVEF did not reach significance. Lower LVEF at 1 year was related to pre-Ross LA dilatation (p=0.02), abnormal LVEF (p=0.04), and lower early diastolic LS rate (p=0.03). LVEF remained stable 3-years post Ross. CONCLUSION: Both transplant-free survival and normalization of LV function post Ross in infancy are associated with pre-operative LV systolic and diastolic measures, highlighting the prognostic value of echocardiography in this population. Further data are necessary in a larger, multicenter cohort, to allow for more precise risk stratification.","Porter, Andrew; Yu, Sunkyung; Lowery, Ray; Fifer, Carlen G; Lu, Jimmy C",J. Am. Soc.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the value of the neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR), calculated at hospital admission and in isolation, for the prediction of the subsequent presence of disease progression and serious clinical outcomes (e.g., shock, death). METHODS: We designed a prospective cohort study of 352 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 between January 9 and February 26, 2020, in Yichang City, Hubei Province. Patients with an NLR equal to or higher than the cutoff value derived from the receiver operating characteristic curve method were classified as the exposed group. The primary outcome was disease deterioration, defined as an increase of the clinical disease severity classification during hospitalization (e.g., moderate to severe/critical; severe to critical). The secondary outcomes were shock and death during the treatment. RESULTS: During the follow-up period, 51 (14.5%) patients' conditions deteriorated, 15 patients (4.3%) had complicated septic shock, and 15 patients (4.3%) died. The NLR was higher in patients with deterioration than in those without deterioration (median: 5.33 vs. 2.14, P < 0.001), and higher in patients with serious clinical outcomes than in those without serious clinical outcomes (shock vs. no shock: 6.19 vs. 2.25, P < 0.001; death vs. survival: 7.19 vs. 2.25, P < 0.001). The NLR measured at hospital admission had high value in predicting subsequent disease deterioration, shock and death (all the areas under the curve > 0.80). The sensitivity of an NLR &#8805; 2.6937 for predicting subsequent disease deterioration, shock and death was 82.0% (95% confidence interval, 69.0 to 91.0), 93.3% (68.0 to 100), and 92.9% (66.0 to 100), and the corresponding negative predictive values were 95.7% (93.0 to 99.2), 99.5% (98.6 to 100) and 99.5% (98.6 to 100), respectively.

The glucose outcomes that reflected the benefits of the virtual consultation were time in range (TIR), time above range, time below range, mean daily glucose, glucose management indicator (GMI), and glycemic variability. This metric was generated using specific computer programs that automatically upload data from the devices used to monitor blood or interstitial glucose levels. If needed, we changed the ongoing treatment at the first virtual visit. RESULTS: Among 209 eligible patients with T1D, 166 completed 2 virtual visits, 35 failed to download glucose data, and 8 declined the visit. Among the patients not included in the study, we observed a significantly lower proportion of continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) and continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) users (n=7/43, 16% vs n=155/166, 93.4% and n=9/43, 21% vs n=128/166, 77.1%, respectively; P<.001) compared to patients who completed the study. TIR significantly increased from the first (62%, SD 18%) to the second (65%, SD 16%) virtual visit (P=.02); this increase was more marked among patients using the traditional meter (n=11; baseline TIR=55%, SD 17% and follow-up TIR=66%, SD 13%; P=.01) than among those using CGM, and in those with a baseline GMI of &#8805;7.5% (n=46; baseline TIR=45%, SD 15% and follow-up TIR=53%, SD 18%; P<.001) than in those with a GMI of <7.5% (n=120; baseline TIR=68%, SD 15% and follow-up TIR=69%, SD 15%; P=.98). The only variable independently associated with TIR was the change of ongoing therapy. The unstandardized beta coefficient (B) and 95% CI were 5 (95% CI 0.7-8.0) (P=.02). The type of glucose monitoring device and insulin delivery systems did not influence glucometric parameters. CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate that the structured virtual visits help maintain and improve glycemic control in situations where in-person visits are not feasible.","Parise, Martina; Tartaglione, Linda; Cutruzzolà, Antonio; Maiorino, Maria Ida; Esposito, Katherine; Pitocco, Dario; Gnasso, Agostino; Irace, Concetta",J Med Internet Res,188,15

Our objective was to analyze myocardial injury and its prognostic implications in patients with and without COVID-19 infection treated in the same period of time. METHODS: The present study included patients treated in a university hospital with cardiac troponin I measurements and with suspected COVID-19 infection, confirmed or ruled out by polymerase chain reaction analysis. The impact was analyzed of cardiac troponin I positivity on 30-day mortality. RESULTS: In total, 433 patients were distributed among the following groups: confirmed COVID-19 (n=186), 22% with myocardial injury (n=41); and ruled out COVID-19 (n=247), 21.5% with myocardial injury (n=52). The confirmed and ruled out COVID-19 groups had a similar age, sex, and cardiovascular history. Mortality was significantly higher in the confirmed COVID-19 group than in the ruled out group (19.9% vs 5.3%, P <.001). In Cox multivariate regression analysis, cardiac troponin I was a predictor of mortality in both groups (confirmed COVID-19 group: HR, 3.54; 95%CI, 1.70-7.34; P=.001; ruled out COVID-19 group: HR, 5.57; 95%CI, 1.70-18.20; P=.004). The predictive model analyzed by ROC curves was similar in the 2 groups (P=.701), with AUCs of 0.808 in the confirmed COVID-19 group (0.750-0.865) and 0.812 in the ruled out COVID-19 group (0.760-0.864). CONCLUSIONS: Myocardial injury is detected in 1 in every 5 patients with confirmed or ruled out COVID-19 and predicts 30-day mortality to a similar extent in both circumstances.","Bardají, Alfredo; Carrasquer, Anna; Sánchez-Giménez, Raúl; Lal-Trehan, Nisha; Del-Moral-Ronda, Víctor; Peiró, Óscar M; Bonet, Gil; Castilho, Gislaine; Fort-Gallifa, Isabel; Benavent, Clara; Recio, Gemma; Gutiérrez, Cristina; Villavicencio, Christian; Auguet, Teresa; Boqué, Carme",Rev. esp. de cardiol.

Generalized estimating equations analyses revealed changes over time as well as differences between groups at low and high risk. Overall, respondents perceived the risks associated with COVID-19 to be considerable, were positive about the mitigation measures, trusted the information and the measures from authorities, and adopted protective measures. Substantial increases were observed in risk perceptions and self-reported protective behavior in the first weeks of the outbreak. Individual differences were based mainly on participants' age and health condition. We recommend that authorities constantly adjust their COVID-19 communication and mitigation strategies to fit public perceptions and public responses and that they tailor the information for different groups.","de Vries, Marion; Claassen, Liesbeth; Te Wierik, Margreet J M; van den Hof, Susan; Brabers, Anne E M; de Jong, Judith D; Timmermans, Danielle R M; Timen, Aura",Emerg. infect. dis,188,30

We conducted a head-to-head evaluation of ten point-of-care-style lateral flow assays (LFAs) and two laboratory-based enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays to detect anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG antibodies in 5-d time intervals from symptom onset and studied the specificity of each assay in pre-coronavirus disease 2019 specimens. The percent of seropositive individuals increased with time, peaking in the latest time interval tested (>20 d after symptom onset). Test specificity ranged from 84.3% to 100.0% and was predominantly affected by variability in IgM results. LFA specificity could be increased by considering weak bands as negative, but this decreased detection of antibodies (sensitivity) in a subset of SARS-CoV-2 real-time PCR-positive cases. Our results underline the importance of seropositivity threshold determination and reader training for reliable LFA deployment. Although there was no standout serological assay, four tests achieved more than 80% positivity at later time points tested and more than 95% specificity.","Whitman, Jeffrey D; Hiatt, Joseph; Mowery, Cody T; Shy, Brian R; Yu, Ruby; Yamamoto, Tori N; Rathore, Ujjwal; Goldgof, Gregory M; Whitty, Caroline; Woo, Jonathan M; Gallman, Antonia E; Miller, Tyler E; Levine, Andrew G; Nguyen, David N; Bapat, Sagar P; Balcerek, Joanna; Bylsma, Sophia A; Lyons, Ana M; Li, Stacy; Wong, Allison Wai-Yi; Gillis-Buck, Eva Mae; Steinhart, Zachary B; Lee, Youjin; Apathy, Ryan; Lipke, Mitchell J; Smith, Jennifer Anne; Zheng, Tina; Boothby, Ian C; Isaza, Erin; Chan, Jackie; Acenas, Dante D; Lee, Jinwoo; Macrae, Trisha A; Kyaw, Than S; Wu, David; Ng, Dianna L; Gu, Wei; York, Vanessa A; Eskandarian, Haig Alexander; Callaway, Perri C; Warrier, Lakshmi; Moreno, Mary E; Levan, Justine; Torres, Leonel; Farrington, Lila A; Loudermilk, Rita P; Koshal, Kanishka; Zorn, Kelsey C; Garcia-Beltran, Wilfredo F; Yang, Diane",Nat Biotechnol,188,16

Even systems with universal access to healthcare (such as the UK's NHS) can only mitigate some consequences of health inequalities. Instead substantial societal measures are required both to reduce harmful exposures and to improve standards of housing, education, work, nutrition and exercise. The case for such measures is widely accepted among healthcare professionals but, in wider discourse, scepticism has remained about the role of government and society in improving life chances along with the belief that responsibility for health and wellbeing should rest with individuals themselves. The stark inequalities exposed by the coronavirus pandemic could be an opportunity to challenge this thinking. This paper argues that doctors should do more to persuade others of the need to address health inequalities and that to achieve this, it is important to understand the ethical and philosophical perspectives that are sceptical of such measures. An approach to gaining greater support for interventions to address health inequalities is presented along with reflections on effective political advocacy which is consistent with physicians' professional values.","Bradley, Stephen H",Clin Med (Lond),188,1

METHODS: Thirty-eight patients with confirmed COVID-19 and 31 healthy controls were included in this prospective and observational study. Individuals with COVID-19 formed the patient group, and healthy individuals formed the control group. Conjunctival impression cytology (CIC), TBUT, Schirmer II test, and ocular surface disease index were evaluated in all participants. RESULTS: No significant difference was observed regarding the mean age and gender between the groups (P=0.786 and P=0.122, respectively). The mean TBUT and Schirmer II test results did not differ between the two groups (P=0.496 and P=0.447, respectively). The CIC results revealed decreased density and cell size of goblet cells and moderate to high enlargement, squamous changes, and increased nucleocytoplasmic ratio in nongoblet epithelial cells in the COVID-19 group compared with the control group. Based on the Nelson classification in CIC samples, 60.6% of the COVID-19 group and 19.4% of the control group had changes consistent with grade 2 or above. The presence of neutrophils in CIC was significantly higher in the COVID-19 group (P<0.001), whereas the presence of lymphocyte was similar between the two groups (P=0.247). CONCLUSION: This study revealed the pathological conjunctival alterations in patients with COVID-19 and demonstrated that pathological ocular surface alterations may present even at the beginning of COVID-19 without clinically significant ocular manifestation.","Bozkurt, Erdinç; Özates, Serdar; Muhafiz, Ersin; Yilmaz, Fatma; Caliskan, Okan",Eye Contact Lens,188,10

The PhotoVoice methodology aims to encourage and foster collaborative and equal partnerships. However, reports of previous projects highlight that not every stage of the process remains participant-centric. There is limited reporting on participant involvement in the latter stages of projects, such as exhibition design. WHAT THE PAPER ADDS TO EXISTING KNOWLEDGE?: It provides a detailed description of the phases involved in planning and executing a mental health PhotoVoice project. It provides an illustration of how collaborative partnerships can extend into the design and construction of a photography exhibition and its narrative. WHAT ARE THE IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE?: PhotoVoice is an ideal methodology for use within the field of mental health nursing as it promotes service user inclusion in research, places value on lived experiences and provides a creative medium through which service users and family members can advocate for themselves and others. PhotoVoice is an effective and creative methodology for disseminating and communicating both the individual and collective outcomes to the general public. When implementing this methodology, clinicians and researchers need to be cognisant of the necessity to include participants as equal partners at every stage, including in the design of photography exhibitions and disseminating the findings to academic and public audiences. ABSTRACT: Introduction PhotoVoice is a participatory methodology in which marginalized communities represent their lived experiences through photography. While the methodology aims to foster partnerships throughout all phases, the literature suggests that in the field of mental health, some phases are often completed without participant involvement. Aims This paper elaborates on how the PhotoVoice method was used to engage service users and family members around their experience of involvement in a co-produced and co-facilitated mental health education intervention, in order to enhance public and policymakers knowledge of the project. Methods Ten participants were recruited and trained in the PhotoVoice method. Participants documented, through photography, their experiences of involvement in the education intervention. Following this, participants came together to co-produce and disseminate the photography exhibition to the public. Results PhotoVoice proved to be a flexible and creative method by which to include marginalized groups. By adhering to the collaborative principles of the methodology, service users and family members can retain decision-making power from the project's inception to its conclusion. Implications for Practice PhotoVoice is ideal for use within mental health nursing as it coincides with the recovery principle of promoting collaborative partnership between service users, family members and clinicians. Mental health nurses work directly with service users and family members throughout their recovery journey. The PhotoVoice methodology is coherent with the recovery principles of empowerment, collaboration and prioritizing the lived experiences of the individual. As such, this methodology has the potential to enhance greatly what mental health nurses can know and understand about the lived experiences of service users and family members. In turn, engaging with the PhotoVoice methodology can provide a platform from which further collaborative engagement between service users, family members and clinicians can take place.","Barry, Jennifer; Monahan, Christine; Monahan, Mark; Murphy, Rebecca; Ferguson, Sharon; Lee, Kelley; Bennett, Anna; Gibbons, Patrick; Higgins, Agnes",J. psychiatr. ment. health nurs,188,1

To this end, we exploit a simple SIS-like (susceptible-infected-susceptible) model with negative feedback between the infected population size and a collective economic resource associated with the average amount of money or income per economic agent. The coupling mechanism in such a system is supposed to be of activation type, with the recovery rate governed by the Arrhenius-like law. In this case, economic resource formally plays the role of effective market temperature and the minimum level of resource consumption is associated with activation energy. Such a coupling can result in the collapsing effect opposite to thermal explosion, so that the epidemic could ultimately drive the system to a collapse at nonzero activation energy because of the limited resource. In this case, the system can no longer stabilize and return to the stable pre-epidemic state or a poorer post-epidemic state. We demonstrate that the system's collapse can partially be mitigated by external subsidies meaning constant resource inflow from some external source or by means of debt interpreted as a negative resource. We also consider a simple quarantine scenario and show that it can lead to different socioeconomic outcomes, depending on initial resource (market temperature) and the minimum level of resource consumption (activation energy).","Gandzha, I.

We used the data from the postal KCL survey conducted by the municipal government between 2011 and 2016. The sample of the current study consisted of 551 older adults (265 men and 286 women) aged 65-70 years in 2011. The median KCL score increased from 2 (interquartile range 1-3) in 2011 to 3 (1-5) in 2016 (p < 0.001). Hence, the prevalence of frailty increased from 8.0 to 12.3% (p < 0.001). Regarding the 5-year transitions in frailty status, 68.3% of participants remained unchanged, while 21.4% transitioned towards a worse frailty status, and 10.3% towards an improved status. Of the 507 respondents who were robust or prefrail at the baseline, 44 experienced a transition towards frailty, indicating that the 5-year incidence of frailty was 8.7%. These 44 individuals had higher body mass indexes (BMI) and lower physical activity scores on the KCL than others (p < 0.05), the latter of which was an independent predictor of transition toward frailty in the multivariate analysis. This study was the first to evaluate the 5-year natural course of frailty status assessed using the KCL in community-dwelling elderly adults, in which the prevalence of frailty increased by 4.3%. To prevent transition towards frailty, maintaining optimal physical activity is recommended.","Ohashi, Masayuki; Yoda, Takuya; Imai, Norio; Fujii, Toshihide; Watanabe, Kei; Tashi, Hideki; Shibuya, Yohei; Watanabe, Jin; Endo, Naoto",Sci Rep,188,1

We conducted this analysis to better understand tocilizumab treatment for COVID-19 patients. MAIN TEXT: We searched major databases for manuscripts reporting the effects of tocilizumab on COVID-19 patients. A total of 25 publications were analyzed with Revman 5.3 and R for the meta-analysis. Significant better clinical outcomes were found in the tocilizumab treatment group when compared to the standard care group [odds ratio (OR) = 0.70, 95% confidential interval (C): 0.54-0.90, P = 0.007]. Tocilizumab treatment showed a stronger correlation with good prognosis among COVID-19 patients that needed mechanical ventilation (OR = 0.59, 95% CI, 0.37-0.93, P = 0.02). Among stratified analyses, reduction of overall mortality correlates with tocilizumab treatment in patients less than 65 years old (OR = 0.68, 95% CI: 0.60-0.77, P < 0.00001), and with intensive care unit patients (OR = 0.62, 95% CI: 0.55-0.70, P < 0.00001). Pooled estimates of hazard ratio showed that tocilizumab treatment predicts better overall survival in COVID-19 patients (HR = 0.45, 95% CI: 0.24-0.84, P = 0.01), especially in severe cases (HR = 0.58, 95% CI 0.49-0.68, P < 0.00001). CONCLUSIONS: Our study shows that tocilizumab treatment is associated with a lower risk of mortality and mechanical ventilation requirement among COVID-19 patients. Tocilizumab may have substantial effectiveness in reducing mortality among COVID-19 patients, especially among critical cases. This systematic review provides an up-to-date evidence of potential therapeutic role of tocilizumab in COVID-19 management.","Wei, Qiu; Lin, Hua; Wei, Rong-Guo; Chen, Nian; He, Fan; Zou, Dong-Hua; Wei, Jin-Ru",Infect Dis Poverty,188,24

METHODS: The study was carried out on a selected group of 60 healthy subjects. All subjects were trained to voice a vocal sample of a sustained /a/, at a conversational voice intensity for the Maximum Phonation Time (MPT), wearing the surgical mask and then without wearing the surgical mask. Voice samples were recorded directly in Praat. RESULTS: There were no statistically significant differences in any acoustic parameter between the masked and unmasked condition. There was a non-significant decrease in vocal intensity in 65% of the subjects while wearing a surgical mask. CONCLUSIONS: The statistical comparison carried out between all the acoustic voice parameters observed, extracted wearing and not wearing a surgical mask did not reveal any significant statistical difference. Most of the subjects, after wearing the surgical mask, presented a decrease in vocal intensity measured. Our conclusion was that wearing a mask is likely to induce the unconscious need to increase the vocal effort, resulting over time in a greater risk of developing functional dysphonia. The reduction of intensity can affect also social interaction and speech audibility, especially for individuals with hearing loss.","Fiorella, Maria Luisa; Cavallaro, Giada; Di Nicola, Vincenzo; Quaranta, Nicola",J. voice,188,16

We developed a twofold framework in this study, which is composed by one novel descriptive model to depict the recurrent global outbreaks of COVID-19 and one dynamic model to understand the intrinsic mechanisms of recurrent outbreaks. We used publicly available data of cumulative infected cases from 1 January 2020 to 2 January 2021 in 30 provinces in China and 43 other countries around the world for model validation and further analyses. These time series data could be well fitted by the new descriptive model. Through this quantitative approach, we discovered two main mechanisms that strongly correlate with the extent of the recurrent outbreak: the sudden increase in cases imported from overseas and the relaxation of local government epidemic prevention policies. The compartmental dynamical model (Susceptible, Exposed, Infectious, Dead and Recovered (SEIDR) Model) could reproduce the obvious recurrent outbreak of the epidemics and showed that both imported infected cases and the relaxation of government policies have a causal effect on the emergence of a new wave of outbreak, along with variations in the temperature index. Meanwhile, recurrent outbreaks affect consumer confidence and have a significant influence on GDP. These results support the necessity of policies such as travel bans, testing of people upon entry, and consistency of government prevention and control policies in avoiding future waves of epidemics and protecting economy.","Han, Chuanliang; Li, Meijia; Haihambo, Naem; Babuna, Pius; Liu, Qingfang; Zhao, Xixi; Jaeger, Carlo; Li, Ying; Yang, Saini",Nonlinear Dyn,188,22

Because of the COVID-19 pandemic, live in-person instruction was not feasible owing to social distancing protocols, so a virtual wet lab (VWL) was proposed and implemented. The purpose of this article is to describe our experience with a VWL as a Descemet membrane endothelial keratoplasty (DMEK) skills-transfer course. This is the first time that a VWL environment has been described for the instruction of ophthalmic surgery. METHODS: Thirteen participant surgeons took part in VWLs designed for DMEK skills transfer in September and October 2020. A smartphone camera adapter and a video conference software platform were the unique media for the VWL. After a didactic session, participants were divided into breakout rooms where their surgical scope view was broadcast live, allowing instructors to virtually proctor their participants in real time. Participants were surveyed to assess their satisfaction with the course. RESULTS: All (100%) participants successfully injected and unfolded their DMEK grafts. Ten of the 13 participants completed the survey. Respondents rated the experience highly favorably. CONCLUSIONS: With the use of readily available technology, VWLs can be successfully implemented in lieu of in-person skills-transfer courses. Further development catering to the needs of the participant might allow VWLs to serve as a viable option of surgical education, currently limited by geographical and social distancing boundaries.","Cervantes, Lorenzo J; Tallo, Christian A; Lopes, Caithlin A; Hellier, Erik A; Chu, David S",Cornea,188,16

Here, we report that induced mild pulmonary morbidities rendered SARS-CoV-2-refractive CD-1 mice susceptible to this virus. Specifically, SARS-CoV-2 infection after application of low doses of the acute lung injury stimulants bleomycin or ricin caused severe disease in CD-1 mice, manifested by sustained body weight loss and mortality rates greater than 50%. Further studies revealed markedly higher levels of viral RNA in the lungs, heart, and serum of low-dose ricin-pretreated mice compared with non-pretreated mice. Furthermore, lung extracts prepared 2-3 days after viral infection contained subgenomic mRNA and virus particles capable of replication only when derived from the pretreated mice. The deleterious effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection were effectively alleviated by passive transfer of polyclonal or monoclonal antibodies generated against the SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain (RBD). Thus, viral cell entry in the sensitized mice seems to depend on viral RBD binding, albeit by a mechanism other than the canonical ACE2-mediated uptake route. This unique mode of viral entry, observed over a mildly injured tissue background, may contribute to the exacerbation of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pathologies in patients with preexisting morbidities.","Falach, Reut; Bar-On, Liat; Lazar, Shlomi; Kadar, Tamar; Mazor, Ohad; Aftalion, Moshe; Gur, David; Evgy, Yentl; Shifman, Ohad; Aminov, Tamar; Israeli, Ofir; Cohen-Gihon, Inbar; Zaide, Galia; Gutman, Hila; Vagima, Yaron; Makdasi, Efi; Stein, Dana; Rosenfeld, Ronit; Alcalay, Ron; Zahavy, Eran; Levy, Haim; Glinert, Itai; Ben-Shmuel, Amir; Israely, Tomer; Melamed, Sharon; Politi, Boaz; Achdout, Hagit; Yitzhaki, Shmuel; Kronman, Chanoch; Sabo, Tamar",JCI insight,188,15

To fight the spread of Coronavirus, governments imposed social distancing policies, which caused negative and positive impacts on the environment. Victoria, the second-most populated state in Australia, was hit by two waves of COVID-19. During the second wave of the pandemic, Victoria, especially Melbourne, experienced one of the most stringent and longest lockdowns globally. In this study, the changes in mobility trends, traffic, air pollution, noise pollution, and waste generation during the first and second waves of COVID-19 in Victoria are evaluated and compared. It was observed that the pandemic had both positive and negative impacts on the environment. During the second wave of the pandemic in Victoria, the mobility trends of public transport hubs, retail and recreation venues, and workplaces experienced a significant drop in movements at respective values of 85%, 83%, and 76% compared to the period of 5 weeks from 3 January to 6 February 2020. PM2.5 levels were lower by 23% at Alphington and 24% at Footscray from 16 March to 1 May 2020 compared with the average PM2.5 levels in the past 4 years.

METHODS: We conducted an observational study from 28 June to 11 August 2020, enrolling patients admitted to the National Institute of Cardiovascular Disease Hospital, Dhaka, Bangladesh, with ST-segment elevation MI (STEMI) or non-ST-segment elevation MI who did not meet WHO criteria for suspected COVID-19. Samples were collected by nasopharyngeal swab to test for SARS-CoV-2 and influenza virus by real-time reverse transcriptase PCR. We followed up patients at 3 months (13 weeks) postadmission to record adverse cardiovascular outcomes: all-cause death, new MI, heart failure and new percutaneous coronary intervention or stent thrombosis. Survival analysis was performed using the Kaplan-Meier method. RESULTS: We enrolled 280 patients with MI, 79% male, mean age 54.5±11.8 years, 140 of whom were diagnosed with STEMI. We found 36 (13%) to be infected with SARS-CoV-2 and 1 with influenza. There was no significant difference between mortality rate observed among SARS-CoV-2 infected patients compared with non-infected (5 (14%) vs 26 (11%); p=0.564). A numerically shorter median time to a recurrent cardiovascular event was recorded among SARS-CoV-2 infected compared with non-infected patients (21 days, IQR: 8-46 vs 27 days, IQR: 7-44; p=0.378). CONCLUSION: We found a substantial rate of occult SARS-CoV-2 infection in the studied cohort, suggesting SARS-CoV-2 may precipitate MI. Asymptomatic patients with COVID-19 admitted with MI may contribute to disease transmission and warrants widespread testing of hospital admissions.","Akhtar, Zubair; Chowdhury, Fahmida; Aleem, Mohammad Abdul; Ghosh, Probir Kumar; Rahman, Mahmudur; Rahman, Mustafizur; Hossain, Mohammad Enayet; Sumiya, Mariya Kibtiya; Islam, A K M Monwarul; Uddin, Mir Jamal; MacIntyre, C Raina; Cajander, Sara; Frobert, Ole",,188,3

STUDY DESIGN: Designed in conjunction with the local arts centre and the psychology team at the University of Dundee, the art boxes were a response to planned face-to-face art interventions with families being cancelled due to COVID-19 restrictions. The aim of the art boxes is to encourage parents to make art together with their infants, fostering connection through playful, creative shared experiences. This research is currently being expanded to reach out to new families through referrals from health visitors, family nurses, and charity partners. METHODS: Data is being collected on how the art boxes are experienced by families using a mixed-methods approach. Families complete feedback cards (online, or using the stamped addressed card included in the box) rating their experience on quantitative scales and providing open comments. Visual data are gathered through parents sharing images with us on social media. An initial sample of 10 participants has been interviewed using semistructured interviews, allowing more in-depth qualitative understanding of their experiences. These preliminary findings are discussed here. RESULTS: The thematic analysis of initial interviews provided a rich picture of the disconnection families experienced during lockdown, why art boxes may be beneficial to parental well-being, and the mechanisms by which the boxes may help to develop connections for the parent and infant together. CONCLUSIONS: Preliminary findings show parents reporting feeling more confident and undertaking new activities which they plan to continue. This was of particular importance during lockdown where parents report opportunities for different experiences being more limited. Parent's describe positive playful interactions and reported improvements to their own well-being from doing creative activities together with their child. Analysis of these initial interviews gives a framework of barriers and supports to connection which highlights how art boxes can facilitate connectedness between dyads with the potential to strengthen attachments.","Armstrong, V G; Ross, J",Public Health,188,22

Under normal circumstances, gross anatomy classes give students opportunities to touch and observe human bones and cadaveric tissues, thus enhancing their understanding; such morphology is difficult to learn from textbooks alone. As many studies have shown, three-dimensional (3D) technologies used in online lectures can serve as alternatives to real specimens for providing knowledge of anatomy. However, such technologies are often expensive. The goal of this study was to create 3D anatomy models for online lectures using a free cellphone app. Free application software (Qlone) was used to create 3D anatomical models. The extracranium and intracranium of adult skull, fetal skull, mandible, temporal bone, second cervical vertebra, and ilium were all scanned and exported to the computer in 3D format. A total of 53 anatomical structures were evaluated by nine observers. Although the 53 structures used in this study did not include all the structures that students need to learn, visibility was good/acceptable for most of the 53. The free and simple 3D scanning app used in this study could enable anatomy educators to provide better content to students during online lectures.","Iwanaga, Joe; Terada, Satoshi; Kim, Hee-Jin; Tabira, Yoko; Arakawa, Takamitsu; Watanabe, Koichi; Dumont, Aaron S; Tubbs, R Shane",Clin. anat,188,24

Since cellular dormancy is one strategy for surviving, and since chemokines determine the environmental conditions in which dormancy occurs, we investigated how chemokines affect temozolomide (TMZ)-promoted cellular dormancy entry and exit in GBM cells. TMZ administration over ten days promoted cellular dormancy entry, whereas discontinuing TMZ for a further 15 days resulted in resumption of proliferation. Co-administration of a chemokine cocktail containing CXCL12, CXCL16, and CX3CL1 resulted in both delayed entry and exit from cellular dormancy. A microarray-based transcriptome analysis in LN229 GBM cells revealed that cellular dormancy entry was characterized by an increased expression of CCL2 and SAA2, while THSD4, FSTL3, and VEGFC were upregulated during dormancy exit. Co-stimulation with the chemokine cocktail reduced upregulation of identified genes. After verifying the appearance of identified genes in human GBM primary cultures and ex vivo samples, we clarified whether each chemokine alone impacts cellular dormancy mechanisms using specific antagonists and selective CRISPR/Cas9 clones. While expression of CCL2 and SAA2 in LN229 cells was altered by the CXCL12-CXCR4-CXCR7 axis, CXCL16 and CX3CL1 contributed to reduced upregulation of THSD4 and, to a weaker extent, of VEGFC. The influence on FSTL3 expression depended on the entire chemokine cocktail. Effects of chemokines on dormancy entry and exit-associated genes were detectable in human GBM primary cells, too, even if in a more complex, cell-specific manner. Thus, chemokines play a significant role in the regulation of TMZ-promoted cellular dormancy in GBMs.","Adamski, Vivian; Hattermann, Kirsten; Kubelt, Carolin; Cohrs, Gesa; Lucius, Ralph; Synowitz, Michael; Sebens, Susanne; Held-Feindt, Janka",Oncogene,188,16

Many times networks over which contagions spread are unobserved, and such networks are often dynamic and change over time. In this paper, we investigate the problem of inferring dynamic networks based on information diffusion data. We assume there is an unobserved dynamic network that changes over time, while we observe the results of a dynamic process spreading over the edges of the network. The task then is to infer the edges and the dynamics of the underlying network. We develop an on-line algorithm that relies on stochastic convex optimization to efficiently solve the dynamic network inference problem. We apply our algorithm to information diffusion among 3.3 million mainstream media and blog sites and experiment with more than 179 million different pieces of information spreading over the network in a one year period. We study the evolution of information pathways in the online media space and find interesting insights. Information pathways for general recurrent topics are more stable across time than for on-going news events. Clusters of news media sites and blogs often emerge and vanish in matter of days for on-going news events. Major social movements and events involving civil population, such as the Libyan's civil war or Syria's uprise, lead to an increased amount of information pathways among blogs as well as in the overall increase in the network centrality of blogs and social media sites.","Rodriguez, Manuel Gomez; Leskovec, Jure; Scholkopf, Bernhard",,188,26

Since then, universal PCR based surveillance testing and PPE measures are in wide use in procedural settings. There is limited published experience on the utility and sustainability of PCR based surveillance testing in areas with receding and consistently low community COVID-19 rates. METHODS: The study was conducted at a tertiary care cancer center in NYC from March 22, 2020, until August 22, 2020. Asymptomatic patients underwent SARS CoV-2 testing before surgeries, interventional radiology procedures, and endoscopy. Contact tracing in procedural areas was done if a patient with an initial negative screen re-tested positive within 48 hours of the procedure. RESULTS: From March 22 until August 22, 2020, 11,540 unique patients underwent 14,233 tests before surgeries or procedures at MSKCC. Overall, 65 patients were positive, with a peak rate of 4.3% that fell below 0.3 % after April 2020. For the 65 positive cases, three were pre-symptomatic, and 38 were asymptomatic. Among asymptomatic test-positive patients, 76 % had PCR cycle threshold (Ct) > 30 at first detection. Five patients tested newly positive in the immediate post-operative period, exposing 82 employees with one case of probable transmission (1.2%). CONCLUSION: The prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection identified on pre-procedural surveillance was low in our study, which was conducted in an area with limited community spread at the later stage of the study Universal PPE is protective in procedural settings. Optimal and flexible diagnostic strategies are needed to accomplish and sustain the goals of comprehensive pre-procedure surveillance testing.","Aslam, Anoshe; Singh, Jessica; Robilotti, Elizabeth; Chow, Karin; Bist, Tarun; Reidy-Lagunes, Diane; Shah, Monika; Korenstein, Deborah; Babady, N Esther; Kamboj, Mini",Clin. infect. dis,188,1

including isolation, lonliness, boredom, access to care and transitions to telepsychiatry and remote medical care created unique challenges for these patients While many patients adapted well to telephone and video visits, the lack of face to face contact, fears of infection and coping with the loss of family and friends created more needs and often demands for increase in services Help seeking and help rejecting behaviors often increased over time The goal of treatment of personality disorders in late life is not to cure the disorder but to decrease the frequency and intensity of symptoms The COVID-19 global pandemic placed unique stressors on these vulnerable patients with limited coping skills Methods Cases studies were identified from the patient population at Mount Sinai Beth Israel, an urban medical center serving a multicultural and socioeconomically diverse population Mount Sinai Beth Israel has been serving the population of lower Manhattan since 1889 and provides

spread of COVID-19 were not applicable to her She often cited her basic rights to refuse things such as wearing masks She became hostile and called the provider from a pharmacy asking for an ""exemption"" to wearing a mask A behavioral contract was developed to assist her in gaining control by chosing her own masks and thermal thermometer She was able to return to in person visits and manage necessary community tasks using safety precautions Ms S is an 82 year old woman with a history of Paranoid personality disorder engaged with the clinic for decades;with periods of absences due to moving to different apartments over suspiciousness towards landlords and neighbors She has been highly functional in isolative jobs but has difficulty relating to others as her suspicious thoughts become overwhelming She has difficulty trusting health care professionals and is reluctant to seek care for medical problems As the initial wave of COVID-19 emerged, her paranoid symptoms escalated acutely She refused to have aides in her home, fearing that they were infected, although needed assistance with ADLs She refused to come in to clinic appointments and disengaged from all services She had no computer access, so phone sessions were initiated on a weekly bases to provide psychoeducation and supportive therapy A modest increase in risperidone dose helped reduce her paranoia towards having home aides retun on a limited bases She was able to engage in a telephone support group that included COVID-19 education and wellness help Ms LL is an 84 year old woman with a lengthy history

We calculated the expected number of deaths using data from 2019 to 2020 (n=17,011), and investigated different seasonal patterns using harmonic dynamic regression with Fourier terms with residuals modeled by an ARIMA method. We did not find any abnormalities in the predicted number of deaths and the real values in the first months of 2020. We found an increase in the number of deaths only by March 20, 2020, right after the first COVID-19 confirmed case in the city of São Paulo, which occurred on March 16, 2020.","Gimenez Junior, G.A.A.; Zilli, P.

Since the COVID-19 outbreak, many studies have been performed on epidemiological data and clinical signs in adults. However, coherent studies in this field are very rare in infants, and support and attention to infants in the pandemic situation should be doubled due to the weakness and underdevelopment of the neonatal immune system. Therefore, the present study aimed to review COVID-19 infection in infants in which there are discussions on topics such as diagnostic tests, clinical manifestations, recommendations on breastfeeding, the criteria for discharge, and family education in pandemic conditions. The literature review shows no existing evidence of COVID-19 placental transmission from mother to infant, and that all samples prepared from amniotic fluid, umbilical cord blood and breast milk in mothers with COVID -19 was negative for COVID-19 infection, and the clinical manifestations of COVID-19 were non-specific in infants, especially premature infants. Given that there is a limited number of births from a mother with COVID-19, and because the epidemiological and clinical pattern of COVID-19 in infants is unclear, this review study describes diagnostic tests, clinical manifestations, breastfeeding considerations, discharge criteria, and family education in the current understanding of COVID-19 infection in newborns and provides information for better management of SARS-CoV-2 infection in newborns.","Damanabad, Z.

Conferences, such as the annual NESPS, are important opportunities to increase visibility of female role models and resources to address deterrents to surgical careers. We thus sought to examine the participation and visibility of women in the NESPS over the last decade. METHODS: Abstracts and programs from the NESPS regional conferences between 2013 and 2019 were accessed via the publicly available past meetings archives, and registration lists were provided by the NESPS. Registrants, panelists, speakers, moderators, and first author and senior author listed for each poster presentation, podium presentation was listed, sex was determined (male or female), and sex were aggregated by category of participation. Significance was set at a P value of less than 0.05. RESULTS: Registration of women for the NESPS annual conferences was constant for 5 years (2013-2017), followed by an increase in female registrants from 27.1% in 2017 to 42.3% in 2019. Female representation among poster and podium presentations also increased from 2017 to 2019 (7.7%-23.3% poster presentations and 11.1%-23.4% podium presentations). Invited positions (speakers, panelists, and moderators) had a peak of 32.2% in 2017, but otherwise, there is no clear evidence of improved representation of women. CONCLUSIONS: We found an increase in the proportion of female registrants at the annual NESPS conferences from 2013 to 2019. However, visibility of female participants fluctuated over the same period; addressing this represents one opportunity for closing the gender gap at the NESPS. As the percentage of female trainees continues to rise, we look to female faculty to continue to participate in educational events, such as the NESPS meeting, and to be present as role models for the growing new generation of female plastic surgeons.","Xun, Helen; He, Waverley; Chen, Jonlin; Long, Chao; Kraenzlin, Franca; Lee, Erica; Yesantharao, Pooja; Cooney, Carisa S; Amalfi, Ashley; Huston, Tara L; Broderick, Kristen",Ann Plast Surg,188,6

One promising though underused approach is to increase the information by borrowing external data on control and/or on treatment effect, which is almost always available. However, the objectives and extent of use of such external data differ widely across studies. They may be dedicated to extrapolate from different populations (from adults to children, across geographic regions, etc.) or treatments. They may adaptively apply during an ongoing trial or be only used at the time of analysis of a trial after study enrollment is closed. They can use only outcome data from a historical control group for either a complete or partial replacement of the current control arm, or focusing on estimated treatment benefit from a whole historical sample. They make various assumptions regarding the exchangeability or commensality of the historical and current populations, with various diagnostics for checking those assumptions. Finally, they use either a frequentist or Bayesian inference, based on aggregated data or requiring individual patient data (IPD). Notably, borrowing of external data often uses Bayesian approaches, by modelling external information into a prior, with increasing complexity to face heterogeneity across populations. Similar frequentist methods based on weighted tests or joint models, have also been proposed, as well as hierarchical models, either Bayesian or frequentist, similar to a meta-analysis setting. Last, methods based on propensity scores and those based on matching-adjusted indirect comparisons could also been used, depending on the availability of IPD. We aim to provide some comparison of the competing approaches for incorporating historical data into a contemporary trial. Data from randomized clinical trials performed in patients with COVID-19 will serve as illustrative examples.","Chevret, S.",Revue d&#039;Épidémiologie et de Santé Publique,188,16

Most of the patients present to the hospital in advanced stage and have a poor prognosis. This study aims to evaluate the efficacy and toxicity profile of oral metronomic chemotherapy (MCT) in the form of methotrexate and celecoxib in locally advanced, recurrent and metastatic head-and-neck cancers. Materials and Methods: This was a single-arm retrospective observational study that included posttreatment patients with locally advanced, recurrent and metastatic disease in the year 2016 (January 1, to December 31, 2016). A total of 84 patients warranting palliative chemotherapy but not willing to take intravenous chemotherapy were included in the study. The oral MCT schedule consisted of oral celecoxib (200 mg twice daily) and oral methotrexate (15 mg/m2/week). Response evaluation was done using the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors criteria version 1.1, and toxicity profile was assessed using the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4.03. Descriptive statistics and Kaplan-Meier analysis were performed. Results: Eighty-four patients, 68 males and 16 females, with a median age of 62 years (range: 35-80 years), were enrolled in the study to receive oral MCT. The Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status was 0-1 in 62 patients and 2-3 in 22 patients. The primary sites of disease were buccal mucosa (18), tongue (22), tonsil (24), lower alveolus (7), hypopharynx (10), and soft palate (3). The best clinical response rate in post oral MCT was seen in the first 4 months (120 days). Objective response was observed in 67% of patients in the form of stable disease (56%) and partial response (11%). Disease progression was observed in 27% of patients. The median follow-up was 192 (6.4 months) days. The median estimated overall survival was 195 (6.5 months) days. The median estimated progression-free survival was 110 (3.6 months) days. Symptomatic relief with respect to pain was reported in about 75% of patients. Eighteen (21%) patients had Grade I-II mucosal reactions. Grade III-IV mucosal reactions were observed in five (6%) patients. Seventy-eight (93%) patients died at the end of the study at 1 year. Dose reduction was required in 15 (18%) patients. Conclusion: Oral MCT using celecoxib and methotrexate is an effective, economical, and well-tolerated regimen with good pain control and low toxicity profile in patients with locally advanced, recurrent and metastatic head-and-neck cancer.","Harsh, Kamlesh Kumar; Maharia, Sita Ram; Nirban, Raj Kumar; Khatri, Pramila; Beniwal, Surenderkumar; Kumar, Harvinder Singh; Jakhar, Shankar Lal",J Cancer Res Ther,188,16

The need to accommodate growing numbers of hospitalized patients has led facilities in affected areas to suspend anew or curtail normal hospital activities, including elective surgery, even as earlier-affected areas normalized surgical services. Backlogged surgical cases now number in the tens of millions globally. Facilities will be hard-pressed to address these backlogs, even absent the recrudescence of COVID-19. This document provides guidance for the safe and effective resumption of surgical services as circumstances permit. Methods: Review and synthesis of pertinent international peer-reviewed literature, with integration of expert opinion. Results: The ""second-wave"" of serious infections is placing the healthcare system under renewed stress. Surgical teams likely will encounter persons harboring the virus, whether symptomatic or not. Continued vigilance and protection of patients and staff remain paramount. Reviewed are the impact of COVID-19 on the surgical workforce, considerations for operating on a COVID-19 patient and the outcomes of such operations, the size and nature of the surgical backlog, and the logistics of resumption, including organizational considerations, patient and staff safety, preparation of the surgical candidate, and the role of enhanced recovery programs to reduce morbidity, length of stay, and cost by rational, equitable resource utilization. Conclusions: Resumption of surgical services requires institutional commitment (including teams of surgeons, anesthesiologists, nurses, pharmacists, therapists, dieticians, and administrators). Structured protocols and equitable implementation programs, and iterative audit, planning, and integration will improve outcomes, enhance safety, preserve resources, and reduce cost, all of which will contribute to safe and successful reduction of the surgical backlog.","Barie, Philip S; Ho, Vanessa P; Hunter, Catherine J; Kaufman, Elinore J; Narayan, Mayur; Pieracci, Fredric M; Schubl, Sebastian D; Heffernan, Daithi S; Huston, Jared M","Surg. infect.,(Larchmt.)",188,26

The inclusion and exclusion criteria are as follows: Inclusion criteria: (1) Japanese male or female patients aged &#8805; 20 years (2) SARS-CoV-2 detected from a respiratory tract specimen (e.g., nasopharyngeal swab or saliva) using PCR, LAMP, or an antigen test within 3 days before obtaining the informed consent (3) Provide informed consent Exclusion criteria: (1) Symptoms developed &#8805; 8 days prior to enrolment (2) SpO2 < 96 % (room air) (3) Any of the following screening criteria: a) ALT or AST &#8805; 5 × upper limit of the reference range b) Child-Pugh class B or C c) Serum creatinine &#8805; 2 × upper limit of the reference range and creatinine clearance < 30 mL/min (4) Poorly controlled diabetes (random blood glucose &#8805; 200 mg/dL or HbA1c &#8805; 7.0%, despite treatment) (5) Unsuitable serious complications based on the assessment of either the principal investigator or the sub-investigator (6) Hemophiliac or patients with a marked hemorrhagic tendency (7) Severe diarrhea (8) Hypersensitivity to the investigational drug (9) Breastfeeding or pregnancy (10) With childbearing potential and rejecting contraceptive methods during the study period from the initial administration of the investigational drug (11) Receiving rifampicin within the previous 2 weeks (12) Participated in other clinical trials and received drugs within the previous 12 weeks (13) Undergoing treatment for HIV infection (14) History of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination or wishes to be vaccinated against SARS-CoV-2 (15) Deemed inappropriate (for miscellaneous reasons) based on the assessment of either the principal investigator or the sub-investigator INTERVENTION AND COMPARATOR: Patients who meet the inclusion criteria and do not meet any of the exclusion criteria will be randomized to either the nelfinavir group or the symptomatic treatment group. The nelfinavir group will be administered 750 mg of nelfinavir orally, three times daily for 14 days (treatment period). However, if a participant tests negative on two consecutive PCR tests of saliva samples, administration of the investigational drug for that participant can be discontinued at the discretion of the investigators. The symptomatic treatment group will not be administered the investigational drug, but all other study procedures and conditions will be the same for both groups for the duration of the treatment period. After the treatment period of 14 days, each group will be followed up for 14 days (observational period). MAIN OUTCOMES: The primary endpoint is the time to negative conversion of SARS-CoV-2. During the study period from Day 1 to Day 28, two consecutive negative PCR results of saliva samples will be considered as the negative conversion of the virus. The secondary efficacy endpoints are as follows: For patients with both asymptomatic and mild disease: area under the curve of viral load, half decay period of viral load, body temperature at each time point, all-cause mortality, incidence rate of pneumonia, percentage of patients with newly developed pneumonia, rate of oxygen administration, and the percentage of patients who require oxygen administration. For asymptomatic patients: incidence of symptomatic COVID-19, incidence of fever (&#8805; 37.0 °C for two consecutive days), incidence of cough For patients with mild disease: incidence of defervescence (< 37.0 °C), incidence of recovery from clinical symptoms, incidence of improvement of each symptom The secondary safety endpoints are adverse events and clinical examinations. RANDOMIZATION: Patients will be randomized to either the nelfinavir group or the symptomatic treatment group using the electric data capture system (1:1 ratio, dynamic allocation based on severity [asymptomatic], and age [< 60 years]). BLINDING (MASKING): Only the assessors of the primary outcome will be blinded (blinded outcome assessment). NUMBERS TO BE RANDOMIZED (SAMPLE SIZE): The sample size was determined based on our power analysis to reject the null hypothesis, S (t | z =1) = S (t | z = 0) where S is a survival function, t is time to negative conversion, and z denotes randomization group, by the log-rank test with a two-sided p value of 0.05. We estimated viral dynamic parameters by fitting a nonlinear mixed-effects model to reported viral load data, and simulated our primary endpoint from viral-load time-courses that were realized from sets of viral dynamics parameters sampled from the estimated probability distribution of the parameters (sample size: 2000; 1000 each for randomization group). From this estimation of the hazard ratio between the randomization groups for the event of negative conversion using this simulation dataset, the required number of events for rejecting our null hypothesis with a power of 0.80 felled 97.345 by plugging the estimated hazard ratio, 1.79, in Freedman's equation. Therefore, we decided the required number of randomizations to be 120 after consideration of the frequency of censoring and the anticipated rate of withdrawal caused by factors such as withdrawal of consent. TRIAL STATUS: Protocol version 6.0 of February 12, 2021. Recruitment started on July 22, 2020 and is anticipated to be completed by March 31, 2022.

But this epidemic has not affected all regions equally. We analyzed the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on hospital stroke admissions and in-hospital mortality in tertiary referral hospitals from North-West Spain. METHODS: Spanish multicenter retrospective observational study based on data from tertiary hospitals of the NORDICTUS network. We recorded the number of patients admitted for ischemic stroke between 30 December 2019 and 3 May 2020, the number of IVT and EVT procedures, and in-hospital mortality. RESULTS: In the study period, 2737 patients were admitted with ischemic stroke. There was a decrease in the weekly mean admitted patients during the pandemic (124 vs. 173, p<0.001). In-hospital mortality of stroke patients increased significantly (9.9% vs. 6.5%, p = 0.003), but there were no differences in the proportion of IVT (17.3% vs. 16.1%, p = 0.405) or EVT (22% vs. 23%, p = 0.504). CONCLUSION: We found a decrease in the number of ischemic stroke admissions and an increase in in-hospital mortality during the COVID-19 epidemic in this large study from North-West Spain. There were regional changes within the network, not fully explained by the severity of the pandemic in different regions.","Tejada Meza, Herbert; Lambea Gil, Álvaro; Saldaña, Agustín Sancho; Martínez-Zabaleta, Maite; Juez, Patricia de la Riva; Martínez, Elena López-Cancio; Apilánez, María Castañón; Isasi, María Herrera; Enguita, Juan Marta; Alfonso, Mercedes de Lera; Arenillas, Juan F; Olaizola, Jon Segurola; Fernández, Juan José Timiraos; Sánchez, Joaquín; Castellanos-Rodrigo, Mar; Roel, Alexia; Menéndez, Ignacio Casado; Freijo, Mar; Rodriguez, Alain Luna; Portilla, Enrique Palacio; López, Yésica Jiménez; Castro, Emilio Rodríguez; Rivas, Susana Arias; García, Javier Tejada; Rodríguez, Iria Beltrán; Julián-Villaverde, Francisco; García, Maria Pilar Moreno; Trejo-Gabriel-Galán, José María; Iñiguez, Ana Echavarría; Juste, Carlos Tejero; Lázaro, Cristina Pérez; Moreno, Javier Marta",Int J Stroke,188,15

In this review, we critically appraise guidance in regard to pharmacologic considerations unique to pregnant and lactating women with coronavirus disease (COVID-19). We summarize the evidence, which supports the routine use of antenatal corticosteroids, magnesium sulfate and low-dose aspirin where clinically indicated, and if not contraindicated for medical reasons. We highlight that decision-making about initiation, dose and duration of prophylactic anticoagulation for pregnant patients with COVID-19 should be made by a multidisciplinary team and must consider disease severity, timing of delivery in relation to disease onset, inpatient versus outpatient status, underlying comorbidities, and contraindications to the use of anticoagulation. We discuss the rationale behind suggested modifications to the use of peripartum analgesia and anaesthesia at the time of the pandemic, as well as considerations specific to mechanically-ventilated pregnant patients. Finally, we discuss emerging evidence supporting the reduction in mortality in patients with COVID-19 with the use of corticosteroids, while tabulating up-to-date information on the safety of various investigational therapies for COVID-19. It is hoped that this comprehensive review while providing guidance to clinicians caring for pregnant and postpartum women during the COVID-19 pandemic will also encourage researchers to consider their inclusion in clinical trials of therapeutic interventions for COVID-19.

This study assessed changes in HFI during the pandemic and examined the interlinkages between HFI with child feeding practices and coping strategies. DESIGN: A longitudinal survey in December 2019 (in-person) and August 2020 (by phone). SETTING: Community-based individuals from 26 blocks in 2 districts in Uttar Pradesh, India. PARTICIPANTS: Mothers with children <2 years (n=569). MAIN OUTCOMES AND ANALYSES: We measured HFI by using the HFI Access Scale and examined the changes in HFI during the pandemic using the Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed-rank tests. We then assessed child feeding practices and coping strategies by HFI status using multivariable regression models. RESULTS: HFI increased sharply from 21% in December 2019 to 80% in August 2020, with 62% households changing the status from food secure to insecure over this period. Children in newly or consistently food-insecure households were less likely to consume a diverse diet (adjusted OR, AOR 0.57, 95% CI 0.34 to 0.95 and AOR 0.51, 95% CI 0.23 to 1.12, respectively) compared with those in food-secure households. Households with consistent food insecurity were more likely to engage in coping strategies such as reducing other essential non-food expenditures (AOR 2.2, 95% CI 1.09 to 4.24), borrowing money to buy food (AOR 4.3, 95% CI 2.31 to 7.95) or selling jewellery (AOR 5.0, 95% CI 1.74 to 14.27) to obtain foods. Similar findings were observed for newly food-insecure households. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic and its lockdown measures posed a significant risk to HFI which in turn had implications for child feeding practices and coping strategies. Our findings highlight the need for further investment in targeted social protection strategies and safety nets as part of multisectoral solutions to improve HFI during and after COVID-19.","Nguyen, Phuong Hong; Kachwaha, Shivani; Pant, Anjali; Tran, Lan M; Ghosh, Sebanti; Sharma, Praveen Kumar; Shastri, Vishal Dev; Escobar-Alegria, Jessica; Avula, Rasmi; Menon, Purnima",BMJ Open,188,20

However, there is no current Food and Drug Administration-approved drug that treats coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Damage to T lymphocytes along with the cytokine storm are important factors that lead to exacerbation of clinical cases. Here, we are proposing intravenous oxytocin (OXT) as a candidate for adjunctive therapy for COVID-19. OXT has anti-inflammatory and proimmune adaptive functions. Using the Library of Integrated Network-Based Cellular Signatures (LINCS), we used the transcriptomic signature for carbetocin, an OXT agonist, and compared it to gene knockdown signatures of inflammatory (such as interleukin IL-1ß and IL-6) and proimmune markers (including T cell and macrophage cell markers like CD40 and ARG1). We found that carbetocin's transcriptomic signature has a pattern of concordance with inflammation and immune marker knockdown signatures that are consistent with reduction of inflammation and promotion and sustaining of immune response. This suggests that carbetocin may have potent effects in modulating inflammation, attenuating T cell inhibition, and enhancing T cell activation. Our results also suggest that carbetocin is more effective at inducing immune cell responses than either lopinavir or hydroxychloroquine, both of which have been explored for the treatment of COVID-19.","Imami, Ali S; O039,; Donovan, Sinead M; Creeden, Justin F; Wu, Xiaojun; Eby, Hunter; McCullumsmith, Cheryl B; Uvnäs-Moberg, Kerstin; McCullumsmith, Robert E; Andari, Elissar",Physiol Genomics,188,22

Variable of experiments to measure body temperature were distances and the inclined angle of the skin surface. The method of designing skin temperature monitoring glasses begins with three main stages process. The first process of understanding and analyzing the characteristics of solar cells, the process of measuring the energy of these solar cells. The second process involves designing and manufacturing electronic systems. The third process is by conducting an experimental experiment on temperature detector glasses. The components of this temperature detector system generally consist of infrared-based temperature sensors, signal conditioning circuits, microcontrollers, and were equipped with software that makes easy controlling.

How to account for this unprecedented reversal of the COVID-19 epidemic situation in Africa, initially delayed compared to other continents, then apparently contained and now difficult to control? In our opinion, at least two factors play a major role in the current spread of the COVID-19 epidemic in Africa: the structural inadequacy of health systems and the serious deficiencies in the African approach to the response. We believe that political decision-makers must assume their responsibilities and inform their decisions on the basis of scientific facts, taking into account the specificities of our approaches to life, the only ones capable of containing fears and participating in the optimal management of crises and ultimately in the development of African nations. If Africa fails, the impact could be catastrophic not only from a health standpoint, but also from an economic standpoint and therefore from an overall human perspective.

With anecdotal reports and in vitro studies suggesting that certain medicines already in use for treatment of other conditions could be viable treatment options, there has been an increased demand for these therapies which could have adverse consequences on patients and healthcare systems. Toxicity from these medicines resulting from a mad rush for them at community pharmacies and pressure on physicians to prescribe for individuals who do not have the infection are worth noting. Furthermore, the indiscriminate use of these medicines could result in viral resistance as well as acute shortage such that patients who routinely take them for other conditions may not get them.","Yamoah, Peter; Alalbila, Thelma Mpoku; Bangalee, Varsha; Oosthuizen, Frasia",Ther Innov Regul Sci,188,21

However, delaying cancer-specific therapies could have a deleterious effect on survival. The potential suppressive effects of chemotherapies or cancer-related microenvironment raised the question on how cancer patients' immune system responds to SARS-CoV-2 virus. METHODS: We have started a prospective monocentric trial entitled COV-CREM (NCT04365322) in April 2020. The primary objective of the trial was to assess specific immune response's intensity and diversity to SARS-CoV-2 in infected patients. RESULTS: In this study, we showed that cancer patients (28 solid tumours, 11 haematological malignancies) exposed to SARS-CoV-2 produced a high rate of specific antibodies, as observed in patients without a cancer history (n = 29). However, our results highlight a lack in the generation of T-cell responses against CoV-N, M and S proteins from the SARS-CoV-2 virus, suggesting that cancer patients failed to mount a protective T-cell immunity. Nevertheless, SARS-CoV-2 infection did not impair established immune memory since specific responses against common viruses were not hampered in cancer patients. CONCLUSION: Given the severity and the unknown evolution of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, it is of fundamental importance to integrate cancer patients in vaccination programs.","Mansi, Laura; Spehner, Laurie; Daguindau, Etienne; Bouiller, Kevin; Almotlak, Hamadi; Stein, Ulrich; Bouard, Adeline; Kim, Stefano; Klajer, Elodie; Jary, Marine; Meynard, Guillaume; Vienot, Angélique; Nardin, Charlée; Bazan, Fernando; Lepiller, Quentin; Westeel, Virginie; Adotévi, Olivier; Borg, Christophe; Kroemer, Marie",Eur J Cancer,188,12

Children wore an Actiwatch for 10 days while quarantine measures were in place for objective measures of light exposure, time outdoors, activity, and sleep. Additionally, parents completed a questionnaire regarding children's demographics, ocular history, and visual activity, including electronic device use, during the COVID-19 pandemic and also for a typical summer before COVID-19. Data were analyzed with repeated measures ANOVA for session (COVID-19 vs pre-COVID-19), day of the week (weekday vs weekend), and refractive error group (myopic vs non-myopic). Results : Objective measures showed that during the COVID-19 pandemic, myopic children had significantly lower daily light exposure (P=.04) and less physical activity (P=.04) than non-myopic children, with no significant differences in sleep duration or time outdoors between groups (P>.05 for all). Subjective measures showed that children demonstrated increased electronic device use during COVID-19 compared to pre-COVID-19 on weekdays (7.3±0.6 vs 4.9±0.5 hours per day, respectively, P<0.001) and weekends (7.9±0.6 vs 6.1±0.5 hours per day, respectively, P<0.001). Time spent doing near work was not significantly different during COVID-19, between days of the week, or by refractive error group (P>.05 for all). Conclusions : Children's behaviors during the COVID-19 pandemic varied between myopes and non-myopes. Objective measures showed that during the pandemic, myopic children exhibited lower daily light exposure and physical activity than non-myopes. Additionally, based on parents' report, children's electronic device use increased, and physical activity and time outdoors decreased during the pandemic. Long term follow up is needed to understand if these behavioral changes as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic contribute to increased myopia progression.","Piña, A.; Mirhajianmoghadam, H.; Ostrin, L.

METHODS: EB patients and controls were recruited during an EB conference (July 2018) and at Tufts Medical Center (June-August 2019). Subjects completed a questionnaire, had best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) tested, and underwent AS-OCT scanning. Stromal and epithelial thickness were measured. Depth, length, and type of the three largest lesions were assessed by a masked examiner using a novel pathology grading system. Multivariate analysis of AS-OCT findings and clinical metrics was performed. RESULTS: 62â¯EB patients and 60 age-matched controls were enrolled. Mean BCVA was 1.8 lines worse in patients (pâ¯<â¯0.001). Vision loss was associated with increased stromal thickness. Discrete lesions were seen in 60.2% of patient eyes, averaging 1.71â¯±â¯1.75 lesions in patients and 0.14â¯±â¯0.42 in controls (pâ¯<â¯0.001). Mean primary lesion depth was 151.88â¯±â¯97.49â¯µm in patients. Patients showed significant stromal thickening versus controls and lesions were most common in the periphery and inferiorly. Differences in frequency and duration of abrasions and severity of pain were all statistically and clinically significant in patients versus controls (pâ¯<â¯0.001). CONCLUSIONS: AS-OCT can visualize and quantify differences in the corneas of EB patients compared with age-matched controls. Novel findings include quantification of average depth, length, and severity of discrete lesions, and sparing of the superior quadrant from stromal thickening in EB patients. These results support use of AS-OCT and a questionnaire in clinical trials for new EB therapies.","Mehta, Nihaal; Robbins, Calvin C; Noh, Elizabeth; Pramil, Varsha; Duker, Jay S; Waheed, Nadia K; Chen, Vicki M",Ocular surf,188,21

Therefore, we compare the SARS-CoV-2-reactive T cell responses in moderate, severe, and critical COVID-19 patients and unexposed donors. Overlapping peptide pools of all three proteins induce SARS-CoV-2-reactive T cell response with dominance of CD4+ over CD8+ T cells and demonstrate interindividual immunity against the three proteins. M-protein induces the highest frequencies of CD4+ T cells, suggesting its relevance for diagnosis and vaccination. The T cell response of critical COVID-19 patients is robust and comparable or even superior to non-critical patients. Virus clearance and COVID-19 survival are not associated with either SARS-CoV-2 T cell kinetics or magnitude of T cell responses, respectively. Thus, our data do not support the hypothesis of insufficient SARS-CoV-2-reactive immunity in critical COVID-19.

Due to a greater risk of exposure to the virus, increased working hours, and fear of infecting their families, health service providers are more vulnerable to emotional distress than the general population during this pandemic. This online survey attempts to assess the psychological impact of COVID-19 and its associated variables among healthcare workers in Nepal. MATERIALS AND METHODS: For data collection purposes, Covid-19 Peritraumatic Distress Index (CPDI) Questionnaire, was used whose content validity was verified by Shanghai mental health center. Data for the survey were collected from 11 to 24 October 2020 which was extracted to Microsoft Excel-13 and analyzed. RESULTS: A total of 254 health care workers from different provinces of the country participated in this study with a mean age of 26.01(± 4.46) years. A majority 46.9% (n = 119) of the participants were not distressed (score &#8804;28) while 46.5% (n = 118) were mild to moderately distressed (score >28 to &#8804;51) and 6.7% (n = 17) were severely distressed (score &#8805;52) due to the current COVID-19 pandemic. Female participants (p = 0.004) and participants who were doctors by profession (p = 0.001) experienced significantly more distress. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 pandemic has heightened the psychological distress amongst health care service providers. The findings from the present study may highlight the need for constructing and implementing appropriate plans and policies by relevant stakeholders that will help to mitigate the distress among health service providers in the current pandemic so that we can have an efficient frontline health workforce to tackle this worse situation.","Kafle, Khagendra; Shrestha, Dhan Bahadur; Baniya, Abinash; Lamichhane, Sandesh; Shahi, Manoj; Gurung, Bipana; Tandan, Partiksha; Ghimire, Amrita; Budhathoki, Pravash",PLoS One,188,1

The necessity to find and pursue relevant information and quantify its quality is broadly acknowledged. Modern information retrieval techniques combined with artificial intelligence (AI) appear as one of the key strategies for COVID-19 living evidence management. Nevertheless, most AI projects that retrieve COVID-19 literature still require manual tasks. METHODS: In this context, we pre-sent a novel, automated search platform, called Risklick AI, which aims to automatically gather COVID-19 scientific evidence and enables scientists, policy makers, and healthcare professionals to find the most relevant information tailored to their question of interest in real time. RESULTS: Here, we compare the capacity of Risklick AI to find COVID-19-related clinical trials and scientific publications in comparison with clinicaltrials.gov and PubMed in the field of pharmacology and clinical intervention. DISCUSSION: The results demonstrate that Risklick AI is able to find COVID-19 references more effectively, both in terms of precision and recall, compared to the baseline platforms. Hence, Risklick AI could become a useful alternative assistant to scientists fighting the COVID-19 pandemic.","Haas, Quentin; Alvarez, David Vicente; Borissov, Nikolay; Ferdowsi, Sohrab; von Meyenn, Leonhard; Trelle, Sven; Teodoro, Douglas; Amini, Poorya",Pharmacology,188,28

The lack of effective vaccines against this lethal viral infection is pushing researchers to identify potential sources from natural products that can help fight the pandemic. In Morocco, medicinal and aromatic plants (MAPs) have long been used to combat infectious diseases. According to our knowledge, this is the first ethnobotanical survey in Fez city, aimed to quantify the ethnobotanical knowledge of medicinal plants used by herbalists for fighting against the COVID-19. Methods: An ethnobotanical survey was conducted in Fez city with traditional herbalists, in a period of two months (from the beginning of November to the end of December 2020). Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 50 well-known traditional herbalists. A quantitative analysis approach was used resulting in the determination of plant use value (PUV) and family use value (FUV) to evaluate the ethnobotanical knowledge. Results: In total, 49 medicinal plants species were recorded belonging to 28 botanical families. According to the PUV index, the most important species were Syzygium aromaticum (L.) Merr. & Perry, Thymus vulgaris L., Eucalyptus globulus Labill., and Artemisia vulgaris L. The Lamiaceae was the most dominant family. The aerial part was the most used plant part. Most remedies were prepared in the infusion form and mostly administered orally. According to herbalists, 47.36 % of customers were very satisfied using herbal remedies to combat COVID-19. Conclusion: The ethnobotanical and ethnopharmacological information collected in our study provides basic data on medicinal plants which is promising in the treatment and prevention of COVID-19. Thus, it is recommended that the safety and efficacy of these plants will be confirmed through pharmacological, toxicological and phytochemical studies. © 2021, Ilia State University, Institute of Botany, Department of Ethnobotany.

It is known that NC2 functions by regulating the assembly of the transcription preinitiation complex. However, the exact role of NC2 in transcriptional regulation is still unclear. Here, we reveal that, in Neurospora crassa, NC2 activates catalase-3 (cat-3) gene transcription in the form of heterodimer mediated by histone fold (HF) domains of two subunits. Deletion of HF domain in either of two subunits disrupts the NC2&#945;-NC2ß interaction and the binding of intact NC2 heterodimer to cat-3 locus. Loss of NC2 dramatically increases histone variant H2A.Z deposition at cat-3 locus. Further studies show that NC2 recruits chromatin remodeling complex INO80C to remove H2A.Z from the nucleosomes around cat-3 locus, resulting in transcriptional activation of cat-3. Besides HF domains of two subunits, interestingly, C-terminal repression domain of NC2ß is required not only for NC2 binding to cat-3 locus, but also for the recruitment of INO80C to cat-3 locus and removal of H2A.Z from the nucleosomes. Collectively, our findings reveal a novel mechanism of NC2 in transcription activation through recruiting INO80C to remove H2A.Z from special H2A.Z-containing nucleosomes.","Cui, Guofei; Dong, Qing; Duan, Jiabin; Zhang, Chengcheng; Liu, Xiao; He, Qun",Nucleic acids res,188,1

Aim: To assess the efficacy of mobile technology intervention on Pap test screening adherence compared to a control condition and also determine the factors affecting the uptake of Pap smear screening practices among women in Lagos. Methods: This is a multi-center randomized controlled trial that will involve women aged 25 to 65 years attending the General Outpatient clinics of the two tertiary health institutions in Lagos, Nigeria between April and December 2020. At baseline, a total of 200 National Health Insurance Scheme (NHIS) enrollees will be randomized to either a text message arm or usual care (control) arm. The primary outcome is the completion of a Pap smear within 6 months of enrolment in the study. The associations between any two groups of continuous variables will be tested using the independent sample t-test (normal distribution) or the Mann-Whitney U test (skewed data) and that of two groups of categorical variables with Chi-square X 2 or Fisher's exact test where appropriate.

A growing number of studies have shown worsening mental health measures globally during the pandemic. However, there is a lack of empirical study on how people support their mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic. This study aimed to examine a number of formal and informal mental health support. Further, it explored factors that might be associated with the use of different types mental health support. METHODS: Data from 26,720 adults in the UCL COVID-19 Social Study were analysed between 13th April 2020 and 3rd July 2020. Data were analysed using logistic and Poisson regression models. RESULTS: About 45% of people reported talking to friends or family members to support their mental health, 43% engaging in self-care activities, 20% taking medication, 9% speaking to mental health professionals, 8% talking to a GP or other health professional, and another 8% using helpline or online services. Gender, education, living status, loneliness, pre-existing mental health conditions, general depression and anxiety, coping and personality were found to be associated with the use of mental health support. CONCLUSION: While the negative impacts caused by the COVID-19 pandemic are inevitable, people can play an active role in managing their mental health. Understanding the patterns and predictors of various kinds of mental health support during the pandemic is crucial for future service planning and delivery through recognising potential barriers to mental health care faced by certain groups.","Bu, Feifei; Mak, Hei Wan; Fancourt, Daisy",Soc. psychiatr. psychiatr. epidemiol,188,16

The aim of this study was to elucidate the characteristics of and outcomes in patients with thymic carcinomas and thymic neuroendocrine carcinomas undergoing LND. METHODS: A retrospective chart review was performed using our multi-institutional database to identify patients who underwent resection and LND for thymic carcinoma or thymic neuroendocrine carcinoma between 1991 and 2018. An enlarged mediastinal LN was defined as having a short-axis diameter >1 cm. We assessed survival outcomes using the Kaplan-Meier analysis. RESULTS: N1-level LND was performed in 41 patients (54.6%), N2-level LND in 14 patients (18.7%) and both-level LND in 16 patients (21.3%). Pathological LN metastasis was detected in 20 patients (26.7%) among the 75 patients undergoing LND. There was a significant difference in the number of LN stations (P = 0.015) and metastasis factor (P = 0.0042) between pathologically LN-positive and pathologically LN-negative patients. The sensitivity of enlarged LNs on preoperative computed tomography was 18.2%. There was a tendency towards worse overall survival of pathologically N2-positive patients, although the difference was not statistically significant (P = 0.15). CONCLUSIONS: Preoperative CT appears to play a limited role in detecting pathological LN metastases. Our findings suggest that the significance of N1- and N2-level LND should be evaluated in prospective studies to optimize the postoperative management of patients with thymic carcinomas and neuroendocrine carcinomas.","Hamaji, Masatsugu; Omasa, Mitsugu; Nakanishi, Takao; Nakakura, Akiyoshi; Morita, Satoshi; Miyamoto, Ei; Nakagawa, Tatsuo; Miyahara, So; Sonobe, Makoto; Takahashi, Mamoru; Terada, Yasuji; Hijiya, Kyoko; Sumitomo, Ryota; Huang, Cheng-Long; Kojima, Fumitsugu; Shoji, Tsuyoshi; Date, Naoki; Miyata, Ryo; Suga, Michiharu; Nakanobo, Ryo; Kawakami, Kenzo; Aoyama, Akihiro; Date, Hiroshi",Interact. cardiovasc. thorac. surg,188,24

The causative agent, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is unusual in that it appears capable of infecting many different mammal species. As a significant proportion of people worldwide are infected with SARS-CoV-2 and may spread the infection unknowingly before symptoms occur or without any symptoms ever occurring, there is a non-negligible risk of humans spreading SARS-CoV-2 to wildlife, in particular to wild non-human mammals. Because of SARS-CoV-2's apparent evolutionary origins in bats and reports of humans transmitting the virus to pets and zoo animals, regulations for the prevention of human-to-animal transmission have so far focused mostly on these animal groups. We summarise recent studies and reports that show that a wide range of distantly related mammals are likely to be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2, and that susceptibility or resistance to the virus is, in general, not predictable, or only predictable to some extent, from phylogenetic proximity to known susceptible or resistant hosts. In the absence of solid evidence on the susceptibility and resistance to SARS-CoV-2 for each of the >6500 mammal species, we argue that sanitary precautions should be taken by humans interacting with any other mammal species in the wild. Preventing human-to-wildlife SARS-CoV-2 transmission is important to protect these animals (some of which are classed as threatened) from disease, but also to avoid establishment of novel SARS-CoV-2 reservoirs in wild mammals. The risk of repeated re-infection of humans from such a wildlife reservoir could severely hamper SARS-CoV-2 control efforts. Activities during which direct or indirect interaction with wild mammals may occur include wildlife research, conservation activities, forestry work, pest control, management of feral populations, ecological consultancy work, management of protected areas and natural environments, wildlife tourism and wildlife rehabilitation in animal shelters. During such activities, we recommend sanitary precautions, such as physical distancing, wearing face masks and gloves, and frequent decontamination, which are very similar to regulations currently imposed to prevent transmission among humans. We further recommend active surveillance of domestic and feral animals that could act as SARS-CoV-2 intermediate hosts between humans and wild mammals.","Gryseels, Sophie; De Bruyn, Luc; Gyselings, Ralf; Calvignac-Spencer, Sébastien; Leendertz, Fabian H; Leirs, Herwig",Mammal review,188,26

Results from 218 respondents show a significant increase in technology use in all investigated contexts after the pandemic occurred. Moreover, the results suggest that different factors may contribute to such increases, depending on the context. It appears that perceived social isolation, concerns about the pandemic, and tracking have the most prominent influence on different use of technology. Furthermore, open-ended responses include beneficial opportunities, concerns & consequences, and behavioral transformations & adaptations due to COVID-19.

We assessed antibody and T-cell responses targeted to the S protein of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) following full vaccination in nursing-home residents. METHODS: Sixty nursing-home residents (44 female, age 53-100 years), of whom ten had previously been diagnosed with COVID-19, and 18 healthy controls (15 female, age 27-54 years) were recruited. Pre- and post-vaccination blood specimens were available for quantification of total antibodies binding the SARS-CoV-2 S protein and for enumeration of SARS-CoV-2 S-reactive IFN-Î³ CD4+ and CD8+ T cells by flow cytometry. RESULTS: The seroconversion rate in (presumably) SARS-CoV-2-naïve nursing-home residents (41/43, 95.3%) was similar to that in controls (17/18, 94.4%). A booster effect was documented in post-vaccination samples of nursing-home residents with prior COVID-19. Plasma antibody levels were higher (p < 0.01) in recovered nursing-home residents (all 2500 IU/mL) than in individuals across the other two groups (median 1120 IU/mL in naïve nursing-home residents and 2211 IU/ml in controls). A large percentage of nursing-home residents had SARS-CoV-2 S-reactive IFN-Î³ CD8+ (naïve 31/49, 63.2%; recovered 8/10, 80%) or CD4+ T cells (naïve 35/49, 71.4%; recovered 7/10, 70%) at baseline, in contrast to healthy controls (3/17, 17.6% and 5/17, 29%, respectively). SARS-CoV-2 IFN-Î³ CD8+ and CD4+ T-cell responses were documented in 88% (15/17) and all control subjects after vaccination, respectively, but only in 65.5% (38/58) and 22.4% (13/58) of nursing-home residents. Overall, the median frequency of SARS-CoV-2 IFN-Î³ CD8+ and CD4+ T cells in nursing-home residents decreased in post-vaccination specimens, whereas it increased in controls. CONCLUSION: The Comirnaty COVID-19 vaccine elicits robust SARS-CoV-2 S antibody responses in nursing-home residents. Nevertheless, the rate and frequency of detectable SARS-CoV-2 IFN-Î³ T-cell responses after vaccination was lower in nursing-home residents than in controls.","Torres, Ignacio; Albert, Eliseo; Giménez, Estela; Alcaraz, María Jesús; Botija, Pilar; Amat, Paula; Remigia, María José; Beltrán, María José; Rodado, Celia; Huntley, Dixie; Olea, Beatriz; Navarro, David",Clin. microbiol. infect,188,26

Although stress has been investigated during this pandemic, there are no reports on anxiety in neurosurgical patients undergoing nonurgent surgical procedures. METHODS: Neurosurgical patients admitted to hospitals in eastern Lombardy for nonurgent surgery after the lockdown prospectively completed a pre- and postoperative structured questionnaire. Recorded data included demographics, pathology, time on surgical waiting list, anxiety related to COVID-19, primary pathology and surgery, safety perception during hospital admission before and after surgery, and surgical outcomes. Anxiety was measured with the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory. Descriptive statistics were computed on the different variables and data were stratified according to pathology (oncological vs nononcological). Three different models were used to investigate which variables had the greatest impact on anxiety, oncological patients, and safety perception, respectively. Because the variables (Xs) were of a different nature (qualitative and quantitative), mostly asymmetrical, and related to outcome (Y) by nonlinear relationships, a machine learning approach composed of three steps (1, random forest growing; 2, relative variable importance measure; and 3, partial dependence plots) was chosen. RESULTS: One hundred twenty-three patients from 10 different hospitals were included in the study. None of the patients developed COVID-19 after surgery. State and trait anxiety were reported by 30.3% and 18.9% of patients, respectively. Higher values of state anxiety were documented in oncological compared to nononcological patients (46.7% vs 25%; p = 0.055). Anxiety was strongly associated with worry about primary pathology, surgery, disease worsening, and with stress during waiting time, as expected. Worry about positivity to SARS-CoV-2, however, was the strongest factor associated with anxiety, even though none of the patients were infected. Neuro-oncological disease was associated with state anxiety and with worry about surgery and COVID-19. Increased bed distance and availability of hand sanitizer were associated with a feeling of safety. CONCLUSIONS: These data underline the importance of psychological support, especially for neuro-oncological patients, during a pandemic.","Doglietto, Francesco; Vezzoli, Marika; Biroli, Antonio; Saraceno, Giorgio; Zanin, Luca; Pertichetti, Marta; Calza, Stefano; Agosti, Edoardo; Aliaga Arias, Jahard Mijail; Assietti, Roberto; Bellocchi, Silvio; Bernucci, Claudio; Bistazzoni, Simona; Bongetta, Daniele; Fanti, Andrea; Fioravanti, Antonio; Fiorindi, Alessandro; Franzin, Alberto; Locatelli, Davide; Pugliese, Raffaelino; Roca, Elena; Sicuri, Giovanni Marco; Stefini, Roberto; Venturini, Martina; Vivaldi, Oscar; Zattra, Costanza; Zoia, Cesare; Fontanella, Marco Maria",Neurosurg Focus,188,26

We aimed to identify potential early prognostic protein markers and to expand understanding of proteome dynamics during clinical progression of the disease. We performed in-depth proteome profiling on 137 sera, longitudinally collected from 25 patients with COVID-19 (non-severe patients, n = 13; patients who progressed to severe COVID-19, n = 12). We identified 11 potential biomarkers, including the novel markers IGLV3-19 and BNC2, as early potential prognostic indicators of severe COVID-19. These potential biomarkers are mainly involved in biological processes associated with humoral immune response, interferon signalling, acute phase response, lipid metabolism, and platelet degranulation. We further revealed that the longitudinal changes of 40 proteins persistently increased or decreased as the disease progressed to severe COVID-19. These 40 potential biomarkers could effectively reflect the clinical progression of the disease. Our findings provide some new insights into host response to SARS-CoV-2 infection, which are valuable for understanding of COVID-19 disease progression.

The objective of this study is to assess the effectiveness of risk stratifying patients for COVID-19 testing and to identify which risk factors and which other clinical variables were associated with SARS-CoV-2 PCR test positivity. METHODS: We conducted an observational cohort study on a sample of symptomatic patients evaluated at an immediate care setting. A risk assessment questionnaire was administered to every patient before clinician evaluation. High-risk patients received SARS-CoV-2 test and low-risk patients were evaluated by a clinician and selectively tested based on clinician judgment. Multivariate analyses tested whether risk factors and additional variables were associated with test positivity. RESULTS: The adjusted odds ratio of testing positive was associated with COVID-19-positive or suspect close contact (aOR 1.56, 95% CI 1.15-2.10), large gathering attendance with a COVID-19-positive individual (aOR 1.92, 95% CI 1.10-3.34), and, with the largest effect size, decreased taste/smell (aOR 2.83, 95% CI 2.01-3.99). Testing positive was associated with ages 45-64 and &#8805;65 (aOR 1.75, 95% CI 1.25-2.44, and aOR 2.78, 95% CI 1.49-5.16), systolic blood pressures &#8804;120 (aOR 1.64, 95% CI 1.20-2.24), and, with the largest effect size, temperatures &#8805;99.0°F (aOR 3.06, 95% CI 2.23-4.20). The rate of positive SARS-CoV-2 test was similar between high-risk and low risk patients (225 [22.2%] vs 50 [19.8%]; P = .41). DISCUSSION: The risk assessment questionnaire was not effective at stratifying patients for testing. Although individual risk factors were associated with SARS-CoV-2 test positivity, the low-risk group had similar positivity rates to the high-risk group. Our observations underscore the need for clinicians to develop clinical experience and share best practices and for systems and payors to support policies, funding, and resources to test all symptomatic patients.","Oshman, Lauren; Caplan, Amanda; Ali, Raabiah; Singh, Lavisha; Khalid, Rabeeya; Jameel, Mohammed; David, Sean P",J Prim Care Community Health,188,20

Despite near hourly reporting on this crisis, there has been no regular, updated, or accurate reporting of hospitalizations for COVID-19. It is known that many test-positive individuals may not develop symptoms or have a mild self-limited viral syndrome consisting of fever, malaise, dry cough, and constitutional symptoms. However some individuals develop a more fulminant syndrome including viral pneumonia, respiratory failure requiring oxygen, acute respiratory distress syndrome requiring mechanical ventilation, and in substantial fractions leading to death attributable to COVID-19. The pandemic is evolving in a clustered, non-inform fashion resulting in many hospitals with preparedness but few or no cases, and others that are completely overwhelmed. Thus, a considerable risk of spread when personal protection equipment becomes exhausted and a large fraction of mortality in those not offered mechanical ventilation are both attributable to a crisis due to maldistribution of resources. The pandemic is amenable to self-reporting through a mobile phone application that could obtain critical information on suspected cases and report on the results of self testing and actions taken. The only method to understand the clustering and the immediate hospital resource needs is mandatory, uniform, daily reporting of hospital censuses of COVID-19 cases admitted to hospital wards and intensive care units. Current reports of hospitalizations are delayed, uncertain, and wholly inadequate. This paper urges all the relevant stakeholders to take up self-reporting and reporting of hospitalizations of COVID-19 as an urgent task in combating this devastating pandemic.","McCullough, Peter A; Eidt, John; Rangaswami, Janani; Lerma, Edgar; Tumlin, James; Wheelan, Kevin; Katz, Nevin; Lepor, Norman E; Vijay, Kris; Soman, Sandeep; Singh, Bhupinder; McCullough, Sean P; McCullough, Haley B; Palazzuoli, Alberto; Ruocco, Gaetano M; Ronco, Claudio",Rev Cardiovasc Med,188,24

Despite the controversy around the clinical benefits of HCQ, the existence of a chiral center in the molecule to possess two optical isomers suggests that there might be an enantiomeric difference on the treatment of COVID-19. Due to their poor resolution and the inability of quantification by previously reported methods for the analysis of HCQ enantiomers, it is necessary to develop an analytical method to achieve baseline separation for quantitative and accurate determination of the enantiomeric purity in order to compare the efficacy and toxicity profiles of different enantiomers. In this study, we developed and validated an accurate and reproducible normal phase chiral high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) method for the analysis of two enantiomers of HCQ, and the method was further evaluated with biological samples. With this newly developed method, the relative standard deviations of all analytes were lower than 5%, and the limits of quantification were 0.27 µg/ml, 0.34 µg/ml and 0.20 µg/ml for racemate, R- and S-enantiomer, respectively.

For developing specific pharmacotherapy against SARS-CoV-2, an in silico virtual screening was developed for the available in-house molecules. The conserved domain analysis was performed to identify the highly conserved and exposed amino acid regions in the SARS-CoV-2-S RBD sites. The Protein-Protein interaction analyses demonstrated the higher affinity between the SARS-CoV-2-S and ACE2 due to varieties of significant interactions between them. The computational alanine scanning mutation study has recognized the highly stabilized amino acids in the SARS-CoV-2-S RBD/ACE2 complex. The cumulative sequence investigations have inferred that Lys417, Phe486, Asn487, Tyr489, and Gln493 are perhaps the iconic target amino acids to develop a drug molecule or vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Geniposide (GE) has anti-inflammatory, hepatoprotective, and cholagogic effects. Whether GE provides inhibition on the development of sclerosing cholangitis is unknown. Here, we investigated the role of GE in a mouse model in which mice were fed with 3,5-diethoxycarbonyl-1,4-dihydrocollidine (DDC) for 4 weeks to induce sclerosing cholangitis. The results demonstrated that the increased hepatic gene expressions of pro-inflammatory (IL-6, VCAM-1, MCP-1, and F4/80) and profibrogenic markers (Col1&#945;1, Col1&#945;2, TGF-ß, and &#945;-SMA) in DDC feeding mice were reversed after treatment with GE. GE also suppressed expressions of CK19 and Ki67 in DDC-fed mice, suggesting that GE could ameliorate DDC-induced hepatocytes and cholangiocytes proliferation. In addition, GE significantly increased bile acids (BAs) secretion in bile, which correlated with induced expressions of hepatic FXR, BAs secretion transporters (BSEP, MRP2, MDR1, and MDR2), and reduced CYP7A1 mRNA expression. Furthermore, higher expressions of ileal FXR-FGF15 signaling and reduced ASBT were also observed after GE treatment. Taken together, these data showed that GE could modulate inflammation, fibrosis, and BAs homeostasis in DDC-fed mice, which lead to efficiently delay the progression of sclerosing cholangitis.","Wen, Min; Liu, Yubei; Chen, Ruiying; He, Ping; Wu, Feihua; Li, Rui; Lin, Yining",Phytother. res,188,19

Hainan Province, China reported 168 coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), including 112 imported cases on February 19, 2020, but successfully contained the epidemic within 1 month. We described the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of COVID-19 in Hainan and compared these features between imported and local cases to provide information for other international epidemic areas. METHODS: We included 91 patients (56 imported and 35 local cases) from two designated hospitals for COVID-19 in Haikou, China, from January 20 to February 19, 2020. Data on the demographic, epidemiological, clinical and laboratory characteristics were extracted from medical records. Patients were followed until April 21, 2020, and the levels of antibodies at the follow-ups were also analysed by the Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed ranks test. RESULTS: Of the 91 patients, 78 (85.7%) patients were diagnosed within the first three weeks after the first case was identified (Day 1: Jan 22, 2020), while the number of local cases started to increase during the third week. No new cases occurred after Day 29. Fever and cough were two main clinical manifestations. In total, 15 (16.5%) patients were severe, 14 (15.4%) had complicated infections, nine (9.9%) were admitted to the intensive care unit, and three died. The median duration of viral shedding in feces was longer than that in nasopharyngeal swabs (19 days vs 16 days, P = 0.007). Compared with local cases, imported cases were older and had a higher incidence of fever and concurrent infections. There was no difference in outcomes between the two groups. IgG was positive in 92.8% patients (77/83) in the follow-up at week 2 after discharge, while 88.4% patients (38/43) had a reduction in IgG levels in the follow-up at week 4 after discharge, and the median level was lower than that in the follow-up at week 2 (10.95 S/Cut Off (S/CO) vs 15.02 S/CO, P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Imported cases were more severe than local cases but had similar prognoses. The level of IgG antibodies declined from week 6 to week 8 after onset. The short epidemic period in Hainan suggests that the epidemic could be quickly brought under control if proper timely measures were taken.","Wu, Biao; Lei, Zi-Ying; Wu, Kun-Liang; He, Jian-Rong; Cao, Hui-Juan; Fu, Juan; Chen, Feng; Chen, Yuan; Chen, Bao; Zhou, Xiao-Li; Huang, Tao; Wu, Tao; Du, Yong-Guo; Chen, Suo-Xian; Xiao, Fu-Rong; Gao, Zhi-Liang; He, Jing; Lin, Feng; Lin, Bing-Liang",Infect Dis Poverty,188,16

A cross-sectional study was conducted using an anonymous online survey between 1 and 12 May 2020. The forward-backward translation method was adopted to translate the FCV-19S into Arabic. The study sample included 725 Jordanian adults. The internal consistency (Cronbach's &#945;) was 0.91 indicating excellent internal consistency. As for convergent validity, a significant positive correlation was found between the Fear of COVID-19 Scale (FCV-19S) and the three subscales of the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale-21 (DASS-21), with the highest correlation being between the FCV-19S and the anxiety subscale (r = 0.54, p < .05), followed by the stress subscale (r = 0.51, p < .05), and lastly, the depression subscale (r = 0.46, p < .05). Construct validity was assessed using exploratory factor analysis (EFA), confirmatory factor analysis (CFA), and item response theory (IRT). The unidimensional factor structure of the FCV-19S was confirmed on the study sample. The Arabic version of the FCV-19S is a reliable and valid instrument with good psychometric properties. The use of this scale for assessing the severity of fear related to the COVID-19 pandemic among Arabic-speaking populations is recommended.

DESIGN: Multisite, pre-post single-group evaluation. SETTING: Community-based social service organizations (Nâ¯=â¯16) in five U.S. states, purposively sampled for maximum variation of participants and providers. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 320 homebound older adults (mean(SD) age 72.9(9.6), 79% female, 44% people of color, 81% low-income, 61% living alone, average four chronic conditions) with clinically significant depression (PHQ-9 mean(SD) 12.7(4.6)). INTERVENTION: Four to 6 month home-based depression care management model delivered by trained front-line providers. MEASUREMENTS: Brief validated social connectedness scales: Duke Social Support Index 10-item (DSSI-10), PROMIS-Social Isolation (6-item), UCLA-Loneliness (3-item); sociodemographic and health measures. RESULTS: At baseline, PEARLS participants overall and with &#8805;1 of the following characteristics were less socially connected: younger (50-64), white, LGBTQ+, not partnered, not caregiving, living alone, financial limitations, chronic conditions, and/or recently hospitalized. Six-months post-PEARLS enrollment, participants significantly increased social interactions and satisfaction with social support (DSSI-10 t[312]â¯=â¯5.2, p <0.001); and reduced perceived isolation (PROMIS t[310]â¯=â¯6.3, p <0.001); and loneliness (UCLA t[301]â¯=â¯3.7, p =0.002), with small to moderate effect sizes (Cohen's d DSSI-10: 0.28, PROMIS-SI: 0.35, UCLA: 0.21). Increased social connectedness was associated with reduced depression. Improvements in social connectedness (except social interactions) persisted during early COVID-19. Being Latino and/or having difficulty paying for basic needs was associated with less improvement in post-PEARLS social connectedness. CONCLUSION: PEARLS has potential to improve social connectedness among underserved older adults, though additional supports may be needed for persons facing multiple social determinants of health. Further research is needed to establish causality.","Steinman, Lesley; Parrish, Amanda; Mayotte, Caitlin; Bravo Acevedo, Perla; Torres, Eva; Markova, Mariana; Boddie, Margaret; Lachenmayr, Sue; Montoya, Carol Nohelia; Parker, Libby; Conton-Pelaez, Edrei; Silsby, Joscelyn; Snowden, Mark",Am. j. geriatr. psychiatry,188,29

Newly implemented hygiene modalities due to the SARS-CoV­2 pandemic have changed medical aftercare and the rehabilitation process. The aim of this study was to evaluate the quality of rehabilitation under corona conditions. MATERIAL AND METHODS: An anonymous survey of adult cochlear implant patients was carried out by a non-standardized questionnaire. Demographics were analyzed and the quality of medical aftercare, speech therapy, technical aftercare, psychological support and the hygiene modalities were compared to previous rehabilitation stays. RESULTS: In total 109 patients completed the questionnaire. The quality of rehabilitation and individual therapy were rated as qualitatively similar or improved. The threat of the pandemic and fear of corona were rated unexpectedly high with 68% and 50%, respectively. The hygiene measures during the rehabilitation stay eased subjective fears at the same time. The majority of patients were annoyed by wearing face masks but visors, protection shields and social distancing were more tolerated. CONCLUSION: The implementation of the new hygiene modalities within the therapeutic rehabilitation setting was well-accepted by patients allowing access to auditory rehabilitation. A successful rehabilitation should ensure a fear-free environment by adhering to the necessary hygiene modalities.","Aschendorff, A; Arndt, S; Kröger, S; Wesarg, T; Ketterer, M C; Kirchem, P; Pixner, S; Hassepaß, F; Beck, R",HNO,188,1

Addition of butyrate is also often needed because ABE fermentation does not produce enough butyrate. Here we addressed the problems using Clostridium beijerinckii BGS1 that preferred to produce isopropanol instead of acetone, and co-culturing it with Clostridium tyrobutyricum ATCC 25,755 that produced butyrate. Unlike acetone, isopropanol could be converted into ester using lipase and acids. C. tyrobutyricum ATCC 25,755 produced acids at pH 6, while C. beijerinckii BGS1 produced mainly solvents at the same pH. When the two strains were co-cultured, more butyrate was produced, leading to a higher titer of esters than the mono-culture of C. beijerinckii BGS1. As the first study reporting the production of isopropyl butyrate from the Clostridium fermentation, this study highlighted the potential use of lipase and co-culture strategy in ester production.","Cui, Yonghao; He, Jianzhong; Yang, Kun-Lin; Zhou, Kang",J. ind. microbiol. biotech,188,29

Existing research on the predictors of compliance with pandemic measures has often produced discrepant results. One explanation for this may be that the determinants of compliance are context specific. Understanding whether this is the case is important for designing public health messaging and for evaluating the generalisability of existing research. We used data from the UCL COVID-19 Social Study; a large weekly panel of UK adults from first five months of lockdown in the UK (n = 22,625). We tested whether the extent to which demographic, socio-economic position, personality traits, social and pro-social motivations, and the living environment predict compliance changed across the pandemic using multilevel regression modelling. Low compliance was strongly related to younger age and also to risk attitudes, empathic concern, and high income, among other factors. The size of some of these associations was larger in later months when less stringent lockdown and household mixing measures were in place. The results showed that compliance was lower and fell faster across some groups, suggesting the importance that public health communications adopt a plurality of messages to maximize broad adherence.","Wright, Liam; Fancourt, Daisy",Prev Med,188,24

Very limited data are available on benefits and risks of COVID-19 vaccination in immunocompromised patients and in particular in solid organ or hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients as they were excluded from phase III trials. This review summarizes current knowledge, international guidelines and controversies regarding COVID-19 vaccination in these vulnerable populations. RECENT FINDINGS: Various COVID-19 vaccine platforms showed good efficacy in phase III trials in the immunocompetent and there are data arising on the safety and immunogenicity of these vaccines in the immunocompromised population. SUMMARY: Transplant recipients could benefit significantly from COVID-19 vaccination, both through active immunization provided they elicit protective vaccine responses, and probably through cocooning by immunization of caregivers and healthcare personnel and thus reducing the risk of SARS-coronavirus-2 exposure. Although awaiting more data on the safety and efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines to inform potential adaptations of vaccine regimens, we strongly recommend prioritizing COVID-19 vaccination of solid and hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients to decrease COVID-19-related morbidity and mortality.","Eberhardt, Christiane S; Balletto, Elisa; Cornberg, Markus; Mikulska, Malgorzata",Curr Opin Infect Dis,188,14

Although azithromycin and ceftriaxone prescribing increased, total antibiotic prescribing among residents was lower from May (-5%, 95% CI 0.94, 0.97) through October (-4%, 95% CI 0.94, 0.97) in 2020 compared to 2019. CONCLUSIONS: During the pandemic, large numbers of residents were prescribed drugs investigated for COVID-19 treatment, and an increase in prescribing of antibiotics commonly used for respiratory infections was observed. Prescribing of these drugs may increase the risk of adverse events, without providing clear benefits. Surveillance of NH prescribing practices is critical to evaluate concordance with guideline-recommended therapy and improve resident safety.","Gouin, Katryna A; Creasy, Stephen; Beckerson, Mary; Wdowicki, Martha; Hicks, Lauri A; Lind, Jennifer N; Geller, Andrew I; Budnitz, Daniel S; Kabbani, Sarah",Clin. infect. dis,188,2

This CTB-SAP model allows us to study the impact of motor neuron death on the output of surviving phrenic motor neurons. After 7(d) days of CTB-SAP, phrenic long-term facilitation (pLTF, a form of respiratory plasticity) is enhanced, but returns towards control levels at 28d. However, the mechanism responsible for this difference in magnitude of pLTF is unknown. In naïve rats, pLTF predominately requires 5-HT2 receptors, the new synthesis of BDNF, and MEK/ERK signaling; however, pLTF can alternatively be induced via A2A receptors, the new synthesis of TrkB, and PI3K/Akt signaling. Since A2A receptor-dependent pLTF is enhanced in naïve rats, we suggest that 7d CTB-SAP treated rats utilize the alternative mechanism for pLTF. Here, we tested the hypothesis that pLTF following CTB-SAP is: 1) TrkB and PI3K/Akt, not BDNF and MEK/ERK, dependent at 7d; and 2) BDNF and MEK/ERK, not TrkB and PI3K/Akt, dependent at 28d. Adult Sprague Dawley male rats were anesthetized, paralyzed, ventilated, and were exposed to acute intermittent hypoxia (AIH; 3, 5â¯min bouts of 10.5% O2) following bilateral, intrapleural injections at 7d and 28d of: 1) CTB-SAP (25â¯µg), or 2) un-conjugated CTB and SAP (control). Intrathecal C4 delivery included either: 1) small interfering RNA that targeted BDNF or TrkB mRNA; 2) UO126 (MEK/ERK inhibitor); or 3) PI828 (PI3K/Akt inhibitor). Our data suggest that pLTF in 7d CTB-SAP treated rats is elicited primarily through TrkB and PI3K/Akt-dependent mechanisms, whereas BDNF and MEK/ERK-dependent mechanisms induce pLTF in 28d CTB-SAP treated rats. This project increases our understanding of respiratory plasticity and its implications for breathing following motor neuron death.","Borkowski, Lauren F; Nichols, Nicole L",Exp Neurol,188,16

METHODS: We used routine care data from 36 hospitals in France and Luxembourg to assess the effectiveness of corticosteroids at 0.4 mg/kg/day eq. prednisone (treatment group) versus standard of care (control group) among adults &#8805; 80 years old with PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection or CT-scan images typical of COVID-19 pneumonia, requiring oxygen &#8805; 3 L/min, and with an inflammatory syndrome (C-reactive protein &#8805; 40 mg/L). The primary outcome was overall survival at day 14. In our main analysis, characteristics of patients at baseline (i.e., time when patients met all inclusion criteria) were balanced by using propensity-score inverse probability of treatment weighting. RESULTS: Among the 267 patients included in the analysis, 98 were assigned to the treatment group. Their median age was 86 years (interquartile range 83 to 90), and 95% had a SARS-CoV-2 PCR-confirmed diagnosis. In total, 43/98 (43.9%) patients in the treatment group and 84/166 (50.6%) in the control group died before day 14 (weighted hazard ratio [wHR] 0.67, 95% CI 0.46 to 0.99). The treatment and control groups did not differ significantly for the proportion of patients discharged to home/rehabilitation at day 14 (wRR 1.12, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.82). Twenty-two (16.7%) patients receiving corticosteroids developed adverse events, but only 11 (6.4%) from the control group. CONCLUSIONS: Corticosteroids were associated with a significant increase in the overall survival at day 14 of patients aged 80 years and older hospitalised for severe COVID-19.","Laure, Gallay; Viet-Thi, Tran; Elodie, Perrodeau; Nicolas, Vignier; Matthieu, Mahevas; Francesca, Bisio; Emmanuel, Forestier; Francois-Xavier, Lescure",Clin. microbiol. infect,188,23

The study uses a self-reported approach of undergraduate students in Spain (n = 337), forced to follow their academic life by using technology comprehensively because of social distancing, as a public health action necessary to reduce the spread of COVID-19. The analysis, based on the exploration of a system of archetypes of the use of social networks, presents insights into contemporary technostress management as a new approach that can suppose opportunities for the optimization of prevention plans. Pearson's correlation coefficients and structural equation modeling based on partial least squares (SEM-PLS) were the methods used for achieving the goals. The results reveal valid and reliable measures where technostress has a high impact on the individual sphere of students and there is a significant relationship between the type of user and techno-anxiety. The conclusions point to the imperative for developing a deeper understanding of technostress by archetypes, in both a higher education context (as antecedent) and the world of work, in an irreversible move towards a digital economy.","Gonzalez-Lopez, O.

Since the first detection in China, it has spread rapidly worldwide. The increased burden has substantially affected neurosurgical practice and intensive modifications have been required in surgical scheduling, inpatient and outpatient clinics, management of emergency cases, and even in academic activities. In some systems, nonoverlapping teams have been created to minimize transmission among health care workers. In cases of a massive burden, neurosurgeons may need to be reassigned to COVID-19 wards, or teams from other regions may need to be sent to severely affected areas. Recommendations are as following. In outpatient practice, if possible, appointments should be undertaken via telemedicine. All staff assigned to the non-COVID treatment unit should be clothed in level 1 personal protective equipment. If possible, postponement is recommended for operations that do not require urgent or emergent intervention. All patients indicated for surgery must receive COVID-19 screening, including a nasopharyngeal swab and thorax computed tomography. Level 2 protection measures are appropriate during COVID-19-negative patients' operations. Operations of COVID-19-positive patients and emergency operations, in which screening cannot be obtained, should be performed after level 3 protective measures. During surgery, the use of high-speed drills and electrocautery should be reduced to minimize aerosol production. Screening is crucial in all patients because the surgical outcome is highly mortal in patients with COVID-19.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The multicentered, cross-sectional study was carried out nationwide among undergraduate medical and dental students. A convenience sampling technique was used. A self-developed online questionnaire was pretested to be completed by the participants. It was distributed using social media. The survey was comprised of questions related to demographics, health status, general hygiene perception, understanding, and the learning attitudes of the students. Comparisons of the knowledge scores and the attitude responses with the demographic information were done using the independent t-test, one-way ANOVA, and Chi-square, as appropriate. RESULTS: Of the 937 total respondents, 353 (38%) were males and 582 (62%) were females; two students did not mark their gender. Of these, 680 (73%) were dental students and 257 (27%) were medical students. The mean knowledge score of the female dental students (5.15 ± 1.08) was significantly higher than that of the male students (4.87 ± 1.09). Overall, the mean knowledge score was statistically higher among the medical students in comparison to the dental students (5.21 ± 1.15, 5.05 ± 1.09; p = 0.054), respectively. CONCLUSION: The medical and dental students were both aware of the importance of the use of a mask. The medical students had a greater awareness regarding the mode of transmission, symptoms, and origin of COVID-19. However, the dental students showed better understanding of the use of surgical masks and the correct protocol for hand washing.

The underdeveloped medical infrastructure and inadequate healthcare staff have become a dilemma during this pandemic fostering the need for digital health system. In this paper we propose Diagnose A Disease (DAD), a novel telehealth solution in Pakistan for remote patient monitoring and disease diagnosis. The three layered hybrid architecture of DAD comprises of data collection layer, analytics engine layer and cloud storage layer. In the first module, vital physiological signs of patients are measured and recorded through a set of wearable sensors. The next module makes use of fog enabled cloud framework for resource management of worker nodes. The analytics engine module also includes a trained Bidirectional Long Short Term Memory neural network model for heart disease, blood pressure and diabetes classification. Finally, the last module makes use of the cloud service for data storage, analysis and distributed secured health data sharing among medical authorities. The telehealth solution comes with emergency notifications, standard clinical guidelines and many advanced features with fog service to reduce latency and delays that becomes crucial in healthcare applications. PureEdgeSim, a simulation toolkit for fog environments is used to evaluate the proposed DAD model in terms of latency, bandwidth usage, power consumption, execution period and accuracy.

OBJECTIVE: To seek stakeholder perspectives on video visits' acceptability and effect 3 weeks after near-total transition to video visits. DESIGN: Semistructured qualitative interviews. SETTING: 6 Stanford general primary care and express care clinics at 6 northern California sites, with 81 providers, 123 staff, and 97 614 patient visits in 2019. PARTICIPANTS: 53 program participants (overlapping roles as medical providers [n = 20], medical assistants [n = 16], nurses [n = 4], technologists [n = 4], and administrators [n = 13]) were interviewed about video visit transition and challenges. INTERVENTION: In 3 weeks, express care and primary care video visits increased from less than 10% to greater than 80% and from less than 10% to greater than 75%, respectively. New video visit providers received video visit training and care quality feedback. New system workflows were created to accommodate the new visit method. MEASUREMENTS: 9 faculty, trained in qualitative research methods, conducted 53 stakeholder interviews in 4 days using purposeful (administrators and technologists) and convenience (medical assistant, nurses, and providers) sampling. A rapid qualitative analytic approach for thematic analysis was used. RESULTS: The analysis revealed 12 themes, including Pandemic as Catalyst; Joy in Medicine; Safety in Medicine; Slipping Through the Cracks; My Role, Redefined; and The New Normal. Themes were analyzed using the RE-AIM (reach, effectiveness, adoption, implementation, and maintenance) framework to identify critical issues for continued program utilization. LIMITATIONS: Evaluation was done immediately after deployment. Although viewpoints may have evolved later, immediate evaluation allowed for prompt program changes and identified broader issues to address for program sustainability. CONCLUSION: After pandemic-related systems transformation at Stanford, critical issues to sustain video visit long-term viability were identified. Specifically, technology ease of use must improve and support multiparty videoconferencing. Providers should be able to care for their patients, regardless of geography. Providers need decision-making support with virtual examination training and home-based patient diagnostics. Finally, ongoing video visit reimbursement should be commensurate with value to the patients' health and well-being.

To test the feasibility of in-hospital video telemedicine, a dedicated telemedicine device was set up in the patient's room. This device and the accompanying Bluetooth stethoscope were used by the health care team located just outside the room for inpatient rounding and consultations from supportive services. Video telemedicine facilitated inpatient care and interactions with support services, reducing the number of health care providers with potential exposure to infection and decreasing personal protective equipment use. In the setting of strict isolation for highly infectious viral illness, telemedicine can be used for inpatient care activities such as interprofessional rounding and provision of supportive services.

Today these processes are poorly understood. Many current studies on digital transformation are only treating questions of economic efficiency. Sustainability and social impact only play a minor role. Decisive definitions, concepts and terms stay unclear. Therefore this paper develops an open experimental testbed for sustainable and innovative environments (ETSIE) for three different digital transformation scenarios using FCMs. A traditional growth-oriented scenario, a COVID-19 scenario and an innovative and sustainable COVID-19 scenario are modeled and tested. All three scenarios have the same number of components, connections and the same driver components. Only the initial state vectors are different and the internal correlations are weighted differently. This allows for comparing all three scenarios on an equal basis. The mental modeler software is used (Gray et al. 2013). This paper presents one of the first applications of FCMs in the context of digital transformation. It is shown, that the traditional growth-oriented scenario is structurally very similar to the current COVID-19 scenario. The current pandemic is able to accelerate digital transformation to a certain extent. But the pandemic does not guarantee for a distinct sustainable and innovative future development. Only by changing the initial state vectors and the weights of the connections an innovative and sustainable turnaround in a third scenario becomes possible.","Hohl, Wolfgang",,188,16

First, an improved ordinal distance measure method is proposed that considers the importance of positions in the ordinal ranking. Next, a hybrid k-means based clustering method that reflects the integration of the cardinal distance and ordinal distance is presented to divide large-scale experts into several clusters. After measuring the consensus of clusters, including both the cardinal consensus and ordinal consensus, they are analyzed by a cardinal-ordinal consensus plot, and the clusters are classified into four categories based on the cardinal consensus threshold and ordinal consensus threshold. Then, by introducing the comprehensive consensus threshold, four consensus control rules are developed to control the consensus reaching process (CRP), and the clusters are subdivided into six categories. For clusters in different categories under different consensus control rules, a specific multi-stage hybrid feedback mechanism is proposed to improve the consensus. In addition, an objective method for the determination of the ordinal consensus threshold is presented. Finally, an application example that simulates the scene of the selection of a hotel for the centralized isolation of entry personnel during the COVID-19 epidemic and a comparative analysis are provided to confirm the validity and effectiveness of the proposed model.","Zhong, Xiangyu Xu Xuanhua Yin Xuanpeng",Computers &amp; Industrial Engineering,188,20

We aimed to investigate whether the ablation technique used for PVI impacts S100B release in patients with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (AF). METHODS AND RESULTS: The study population consisted of 73 consecutive patients (age: 62.7 ± 10.9 years, 54.8% males) undergoing first-time PVI with either radiofrequency (RF; n = 30) or cryoballoon (CB; n = 43) for paroxysmal AF. S100B determined from venous plasma samples taken immediately before and after PVI increased from 33.5 ± 1.8 to 91.1 ± 5.3 pg/mL (P < 0.0001). S100B release in patients undergoing CB-PVI was 3.9 times higher compared to patients with RF-PVI (&#916;S100B: 21.1 ± 2.7 vs. 83.1 ± 5.2 pg/mL, P < 0.0001). During a mean follow-up of 314 ± 186 days, AF recurrences were observed in 18/71 (25.4%) patients (RF-PVI: n = 9/28, CB-PVI: n = 9/43). Univariate Cox regression analysis indicated that an increase in S100B was associated with higher freedom from AF in follow-up (hazard ratio per 10 pg/mL release of S100B: 0.83; 95% confidence interval: 0.72-0.95; P = 0.007). CONCLUSION: The ablation technique used for PVI has an impact on the release of S100B, a well-established biomarker for neural damage.","Scherschel, Katharina; Hedenus, Katja; Jungen, Christiane; Münkler, Paula; Willems, Stephan; Anwar, Omar; Klatt, Niklas; Eickholt, Christian; Meyer, Christian",Europace,188,1

Current systems have been successfully applied for documents in English and, as a result, a promising direction is to increase coverage and recall by considering documents in additional languages, such as Spanish or Chinese. Training previous systems for more languages, however, would be expensive, as it would require the manual annotation of many documents for each new target language. To address this challenge, we consider cross-lingual learning and train multilingual classifiers using only the annotations for English-language reviews. Recent zero-shot approaches based on pre-trained multi-lingual BERT (mBERT) have been shown to effectively align languages for aspects such as sentiment. Interestingly, we show that those approaches are less effective for capturing the nuances of foodborne illness, our public health application of interest. To improve performance without extra annotations, we create artificial training documents in the target language through machine translation and train mBERT jointly for the source (English) and target language. Furthermore, we show that translating labeled documents to multiple languages leads to additional performance improvements for some target languages. We demonstrate the benefits of our approach through extensive experiments with Yelp restaurant reviews in seven languages. Our classifiers identify foodborne illness complaints in multilingual reviews from the Yelp Challenge dataset, which highlights the potential of our general approach for deployment in health departments.","Liu, Ziyi; Karamanolakis, Giannis; Hsu, Daniel; Gravano, Luis",,188,12

METHODS: IMIA Primary Care Informatics Working Group members from Australia, Canada, United Kingdom and United States developed a standardised template for collection of information. The template guided a rapid literature review. We also included experiential learning from primary care and public health perspectives. RESULTS: All countries responded rapidly. Common themes included rapid reductions then transformation to virtual visits, pausing of non-COVID related informatics projects, all against a background of non-standardized digital development and disparate territory or state regulations and guidance. Common barriers in these four and in less-resourced countries included disparities in internet access and availability including bandwidth limitations when internet access was available, initial lack of coding standards, and fears of primary care clinicians that patients were delaying care despite the availability of televisits. CONCLUSIONS: Primary care clinicians were able to respond to the COVID crisis through telehealth and electronic record enabled change. However, the lack of coordinated national strategies and regulation, assurance of financial viability, and working in silos remained limitations.

Under-recognition of depressive symptoms may contribute to existing disparities in depression treatment. The objective of this cross-sectional study was to determine whether physicians recognize and treat depressive symptoms for Chinese and Latinx patients during routine primary care visits. Methods: We analyzed data from 1171 Chinese and Latinx patients who were interviewed within 1 week after a primary care visit in a large academic practice, which had not yet implemented universal depression screening. We included participants with depressive symptoms (defined as a Patient Health Questionaire-2 score ≥3) and no prior history of depression (N=118). We investigated whether patients perceived having a mental health need in the prior year and conducted chart reviews to assess provider recognition of depressive symptoms, defined as documentation of symptoms, antidepressant initiation, or mental health referral within 30 days of the visit. We further examined differences by race/ethnicity and language preference. Results: Among the 118 patients with depressive symptoms and no prior depression diagnosis (mean age 68), 71 (61%) reported a mental health need in the prior 12 months;however, providers recognized depressive symptoms in only 8/118 patients (7%).

On February 28, 2020 of Geneva time, the World Health Organization has raised global risk level to the very high level in view of outbreak of COVID-19. Since some patients' condition appeared to deteriorate rapidly after infection of this 2019 novel coronavirus(2019-nCoV), a variety of treatments should be considered. Holistic view and syndrome differentiation are the two characteristics of traditional Chinese medicine(TCM). Therefore, under the guidance of the holistic view, syndrome diffe-rentiation of TCM has achieved good effects in the treatment of COVID-19. This treatment mainly aimed at eliminating pathogens and strengthening overall health, regulating the balance of body and coordinating various of functions of Zangfu organs. In addition, modern medical proposes host-directed therapy(HDT), a strategy aims to interfere with host cell mechanism, enhance immune responses, and reduce exacerbated inflammation. To some extent, the combined application of HDT and antiviral therapy is highly consistent with the therapeutic concept of the holistic view of TCM. Therefore, under the guidance of the holistic view, syndrome differentiation of TCM uses treatments, such as clearing heat, detoxification, relieving asthma, clearing damp and phlegm, together with Lianhua Qingwen Capsules, Maxing Shigan Decoction, and Haoqin Qingdan Decoction under the guidance of these therapeutic methods. These therapeutic methods and prescriptions intervened with both virus and host at the same time in the treatment of COVID-19, which has important implications for the effective clinical treatment of COVID-19.","Yuan, Rong; Xin, Qi-Qi; Tang, Shi-Huan; Cong, Wei-Hong",Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi,188,16

Due to their inherent flexibility and robustness, multi-agent systems are applied in a growing range of real-world problems that involve heterogeneous tasks and uncertain information. Most previous works assume a unique way to decompose a task into roles that can later be assigned to the agents. This assumption is not valid for a complex task where the roles can vary and multiple decomposition structures exist. Meanwhile, it is unclear how uncertainties in task requirements and agent capabilities can be systematically quantified and optimized under a multi-agent system setting. A representation for complex tasks is proposed to avoid the non-convex task decomposition enumeration: agent capabilities are represented as a vector of random distributions, and task requirements are verified by a generalizable binary function. The conditional value at risk (CVaR) is chosen as a metric in the objective function to generate robust plans. An efficient algorithm is described to solve the model, and the whole framework is evaluated in two different practical test cases: capture-the-flag and robotic service coordination during a pandemic (e.g., COVID-19). Results demonstrate that the framework is scalable, generalizable, and provides low-cost plans that ensure a high probability of success.","Fu, Bo; Smith, William; Rizzo, Denise; Castanier, Matthew; Ghaffari, Maani; Barton, Kira",,188,21

METHODS: An online survey using social media-based advertising was conducted among U.S. adults in April 2020. Participants were asked whether they thought they could acquire a COVID-19 test, along with basic demographic, socioeconomic and geographic information. RESULTS: A total of 6,378 participants provided data on perceived access to COVID-19 testing. In adjusted analyses, we found higher income and possession of health insurance to be associated with perceived ability to access Coronavirus testing. Geographically, perceived access was highest (68%) in East South Central division and lowest (39%) in West North Central. Disparities in health insurance coverage did not directly correspond to disparities in perceived access to COVID-19 testing. CONCLUSIONS: Sex, geographic location, income, and insurance status were associated with perceived access to COVID-19 testing; interventions aimed at improving either access or awareness of measures taken to improve access are warranted. These findings from the pandemic's early months shed light on the importance of disaggregating perceived and true access to screening during such crises.","Ali, Shahmir H; Tozan, Yesim; Jones, Abbey M; Foreman, Joshua; Capasso, Ariadna; DiClemente, Ralph J",Ann Epidemiol,188,21

The policy was revised in three subsequent stages (Lockdown 2.0-4.0 between 15 April to 18 May 2020), and restrictions were lifted (Unlockdown 1.0) on 1 June 2020. This study evaluated the effect of lockdown policy on the COVID-19 incidence rate at the national level to inform policy response for this and future pandemics. We conducted an interrupted time series analysis with a segmented regression model using publicly available data on daily reported new COVID-19 cases between 2 March 2020 and 1 September 2020. National-level data from Google Community Mobility Reports during this timeframe were also used in model development and robustness checks. Results showed an 8% [95% confidence interval (CI) = 6-9%] reduction in the change in incidence rate per day after Lockdown 1.0 compared to prior to the Lockdown order, with an additional reduction of 3% (95% CI = 2-3%) after Lockdown 4.0, suggesting an 11% (95% CI = 9-12%) reduction in the change in COVID-19 incidence after Lockdown 4.0 compared to the period before Lockdown 1.0. Uptake of the lockdown policy is indicated by decreased mobility and attenuation of the increasing incidence of COVID-19. The increasing rate of incident case reports in India was attenuated after the lockdown policy was implemented compared to before, and this reduction was maintained after the restrictions were eased, suggesting that the policy helped to 'flatten the curve' and buy additional time for pandemic preparedness, response and recovery.","Thayer, Winter M; Hasan, Md Zabir; Sankhla, Prithvi; Gupta, Shivam",Health Policy Plan,188,1

OBJECTIVE: To describe the incidence and severity of COVID-19 by nucleos(t)ide reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) use among HIV-positive persons receiving ART. DESIGN: Cohort study. SETTING: HIV clinics in 60 Spanish hospitals between 1 February and 15 April 2020. PARTICIPANTS: 77 590 HIV-positive persons receiving ART. MEASUREMENTS: Estimated risks (cumulative incidences) per 10 000 persons and 95% CIs for polymerase chain reaction-confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis, hospitalization, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, and death. Risk and 95% CIs for COVID-19 diagnosis and hospital admission by use of the NRTIs tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF)/emtricitabine (FTC), tenofovir alafenamide (TAF)/FTC, abacavir (ABC)/lamivudine (3TC), and others were estimated through Poisson regression models. RESULTS: Of 77 590 HIV-positive persons receiving ART, 236 were diagnosed with COVID-19, 151 were hospitalized, 15 were admitted to the ICU, and 20 died. The risks for COVID-19 diagnosis and hospitalization were greater in men and persons older than 70 years. The risk for COVID-19 hospitalization was 20.3 (95% CI, 15.2 to 26.7) among patients receiving TAF/FTC, 10.5 (CI, 5.6 to 17.9) among those receiving TDF/FTC, 23.4 (CI, 17.2 to 31.1) among those receiving ABC/3TC, and 20.0 (CI, 14.2 to 27.3) for those receiving other regimens. The corresponding risks for COVID-19 diagnosis were 39.1 (CI, 31.8 to 47.6), 16.9 (CI, 10.5 to 25.9), 28.3 (CI, 21.5 to 36.7), and 29.7 (CI, 22.6 to 38.4), respectively. No patient receiving TDF/FTC was admitted to the ICU or died. LIMITATION: Residual confounding by comorbid conditions cannot be completely excluded. CONCLUSION: HIV-positive patients receiving TDF/FTC have a lower risk for COVID-19 and related hospitalization than those receiving other therapies. These findings warrant further investigation in HIV preexposure prophylaxis studies and randomized trials in persons without HIV.

METHODS: Using a mixed-methods approach, educators in magnetic resonance, medical dosimetry, radiation therapy, and radiography programs were surveyed to capture their experiences and mitigation strategies related to COVID-19 response planning. Quantitative data were summarized using descriptive statistics and percentages. Thematic analyses were performed on the qualitative responses. RESULTS: A total of 274 educators responded. Educators reported being somewhat comfortable with modifying clinical experiences (79, 28.8%), moderately comfortable with adjusting assessment procedures (112, 40.9%), and extremely comfortable with changing delivery of didactic content (115, 42%). Incidentally, 220 (80.3%) educators thought adjusting to a new course delivery approach (eg, face-to-face to online format) was the greatest challenge for faculty during the pandemic. Notably, half of the educators in this study questioned the quality of online (remote) learning. Specific to program policies, educators indicated that access restrictions to campus buildings (263, 96%) and removal of students from clinical sites (254, 92.7%) were implemented during the pandemic. DISCUSSION: Educators self-reported a moderate to strong comfort level with curricular modification. The area of modification that yielded the most uncertainty arose from alterations of clinical experiences. Thematic analyses revealed concerns related to personal protective equipment procurement and clinical sites prohibiting students from completing rotations. However, educators created innovative alternatives to enhance clinical education by providing simulations, case study analyses, and virtual tours of facilities during the pandemic. Securing educational technology resources, such as lockdown browser software, and working with institutional instructional designers might provide some resolution to educators' concerns regarding the quality of online (remote) learning. CONCLUSION: Archiving radiologic science programs' COVID-19 response efforts is important. The compilation of mitigation strategies will inform and guide programs on contingency planning for future pandemic and emergent conditions.","Webster, Tammy L; Clark, Kevin R",Radiol Technol,188,14

This study focusses on three different treatment processes by characterizing all arising fractions in detail. Thereby the factors influencing the composition of these fractions are identified and their recycling potential in Switzerland is investigated. However, high legislative requirements on total contents of heavy metals represent a high barrier for bottom ash recycling in Switzerland. Therefore, the recycling potential is further evaluated based on the waste legislation applied in the Netherlands, where recycling of bottom ash has a long tradition. There, threshold values for bottom ash recycling are based on leachate concentrations and not on total contents as in Switzerland. However, Swiss Waste Legislation also knows threshold values based on leachate concentrations for certain waste materials. The leaching tests applied in these two countries, however, are different. The comparison of both leaching tests reveals that the setup and conditions, especially the considered pH range, significantly influence the leaching of heavy metals. With emphasis on problematic pollutants, the possibilities for new applications of these fractions are evaluated based on Swiss and Dutch legal threshold values. The comparison within the legal frameworks of these two countries allows recognizing opportunities and risks related to bottom ash recycling.","Glauser, Andreas; Weibel, Gisela; Eggenberger, Urs",Waste Manag Res,188,26

Health- and entertainment- related topics are found to have gained, and sports- and transportation- related topics, to have lost attention. Interestingly, while the interest in health-related topics was transient, that in entertainment topics is lingering and even increasing. These changes began at the time when mobility was restricted and are most pronounced for language editions associated with countries, in which the most severe mobility restrictions were implemented, indicating that the interest shift might be caused by people's spending more time at home.

However, large-scale FEL still faces following crucial challenges: (i) there lacks a secure and communication-efficient model training scheme for FEL; (2) there is no scalable and flexible FEL framework for updating local models and global model sharing (trading) management. To bridge the gaps, we first propose a blockchain-empowered secure FEL system with a hierarchical blockchain framework consisting of a main chain and subchains. This framework can achieve scalable and flexible decentralized FEL by individually manage local model updates or model sharing records for performance isolation. A Proof-of-Verifying consensus scheme is then designed to remove low-quality model updates and manage qualified model updates in a decentralized and secure manner, thereby achieving secure FEL. To improve communication efficiency of the blockchain-empowered FEL, a gradient compression scheme is designed to generate sparse but important gradients to reduce communication overhead without compromising accuracy, and also further strengthen privacy preservation of training data. The security analysis and numerical results indicate that the proposed schemes can achieve secure, scalable, and communication-efficient decentralized FEL.","Kang, Jiawen; Xiong, Zehui; Jiang, Chunxiao; Liu, Yi; Guo, Song; Zhang, Yang; Niyato, Dusit; Leung, Cyril; Miao, Chunyan",,188,16

First taking the log out of our own eyes,14.5580635,6.0952587,2021,"BACKGROUND: The recent coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic is taking a toll on the world's health care infrastructure as well as the social, economic, and psychological well-being of humanity. Individuals, organizations, and governments are using social media to communicate with each other on a number of issues relating to the COVID-19 pandemic. Not much is known about the topics being shared on social media platforms relating to COVID-19. Analyzing such information can help policy makers and health care organizations assess the needs of their stakeholders and address them appropriately. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to identify the main topics posted by Twitter users related to the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Leveraging a set of tools (Twitter's search application programming interface (API), Tweepy Python library, and PostgreSQL database) and using a set of predefined search terms (""corona,"" ""2019-nCov,"" and ""COVID-19""), we extracted the text and metadata (number of likes and retweets, and user profile information including the number of followers) of public English language tweets from February 2, 2020, to March 15, 2020. We analyzed the collected tweets using word frequencies of single (unigrams) and double words (bigrams). We leveraged latent Dirichlet allocation for topic modeling to identify topics discussed in the tweets. We also performed sentiment analysis and extracted the mean number of retweets, likes, and followers for each topic and calculated the interaction rate per topic. RESULTS: Out of approximately 2.8 million tweets included, 167,073 unique tweets from 160,829 unique users met the inclusion criteria. Our analysis identified 12 topics, which were grouped into four main themes: origin of the virus; its sources; its impact on people, countries, and the economy; and ways of mitigating the risk of infection. The mean sentiment was positive for 10 topics and negative for 2 topics (deaths caused by COVID-19 and increased racism). The mean for tweet topics of account followers ranged from 2722 (increased racism) to 13,413 (economic losses). The highest mean of likes for the tweets was 15.4 (economic loss), while the lowest was 3.94 (travel bans and warnings). CONCLUSIONS: Public health crisis response activities on the ground and online are becoming increasingly simultaneous and intertwined. Social media provides an opportunity to directly communicate health information to the public. Health systems should work on building national and international disease detection and surveillance systems through monitoring social media. There is also a need for a more proactive and agile public health presence on social media to combat the spread of fake news.","Abd-Alrazaq, Alaa; Alhuwail, Dari; Househ, Mowafa; Hamdi, Mounir; Shah, Zubair",J Med Internet Res,188,24

Reasons for use include management of psychosocial stressors, physical and psychological symptoms. We explored the effect of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic on on patients' cannabis use, hypothesizing that users would be increasing their use due to heightened stress and increased uncertainty. METHODS: Participants were part of an anonymous online survey of cannabis use in cancer. Items specific to COVID-19 were administered between April and June 2020. RESULTS: Thirty-one percent of respondents (n = 26) confirmed they used cannabis during COVID-19. The top 5 reasons for use were sleep, anxiety, nausea, pain, and appetite. Ninety-two percent denied they were using cannabis for new or different symptoms. Eighty-one percent were using about the same amount as before, 11.5% were using less, and 8% more. Only 12% reported that product cost affected their use and that they had changed the way in which they used cannabis. Eight percent were stockpiling product so that they did not run out during the pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: The percentages of those reporting a change in cannabis use were modest. Increased use may reflect efforts to relieve stress. Decreased use may reflect barriers to securing unregulated products and perceived vulnerability to the effects of infection on the respiratory system. As the pandemic continues to evolve, it will be important to monitor its effects on cancer patients as it relates to psychosocial stressors, psychological symptoms, and cannabis use.","Donovan, Kristine A; Portman, Diane G",Am J Hosp Palliat Care,188,1

However, it remains unclear whether CMC modulation would depend on the contribution of neural mechanisms acting at the spinal level. To this purpose, modulations of CMC were compared during submaximal isometric, shortening and lengthening contractions of the soleus (SOL) and the medial gastrocnemius (MG) with a concurrent analysis of changes in spinal excitability that may be reduced during lengthening contractions. Submaximal contractions intensity was set at 50% of the maximal SOL EMG activity. CMC was computed in the time-frequency domain between the Cz EEG electrode signal and the unrectified SOL or MG EMG signal. Spinal excitability was quantified through normalized Hoffmann (H) reflex amplitude. The results indicate that beta-band CMC and normalized H-reflex were significantly lower in SOL during lengthening compared with isometric contractions, but were similar in MG for all three muscle contraction types. Collectively, these results highlight an effect of contraction type on beta-band CMC, although it may differ between agonist synergist muscles. These novel findings also provide new evidence that beta-band CMC modulation may involve spinal regulatory mechanisms.","Glories, Dorian; Soulhol, Mathias; Amarantini, David; Duclay, Julien",Sci Rep,188,16

METHODS: This was an observational study performed using a life-size head model to simulate tonsil surgery and fluorescein-soaked strawberries to mimic tonsils. The Coblation wand was activated over the strawberries for 5 minutes. This was repeated 5 times with 2 surgeons (totalling 10 data sets). The presence of droplet around the surgical field and anatomical subsites on the surgeon was assessed in binary fashion: present or not present. The results were collated as frequency of droplet detection and illustrated as a heatmap; 0 = white, 1-2 = yellow, 3-4 = orange, and 5 = red. RESULTS: Fluorescein droplets were detected in all 4 quadrants of the surgical field. The frequency of splatter was greatest in the upper (nearest to surgeon) and lower quadrants. There were detectable splatter droplets on the surgeon; most frequently occurring on the hands followed by the forearm. Droplets were also detected on the visor, neck, and chest albeit less frequently. However, none were detected on the upper arms. CONCLUSION: Droplet splatter can be detected in the immediate surgical field as well as on the surgeon.

Self-appointed religious authorities claim to possess the interpretational sovereignty regarding the 'divine signs' visualized by the pandemic: the 'just punishment' for those who have not been true believers. The narrative of the final battle between the 'good' and the 'evil' indicates a well-known tradition in the field of millennialism. Against the background of a transnational health crisis, this motive is currently revitalized and interlinked by IS affiliated groups and individuals with the fear of some Muslims regarding the end time. With this strategy, IS tries to fuel hatred and violence towards European societies and regain fame again. Specific vulnerable groups such as (hopeless) former Foreign Terrorist Fighters (FTFs) and female inhabitants of detention camps in Syria as well as their children are the main targets of the IS narratives concerning Covid-19. According to their inner assessment, they seem to have nothing to 'lose' in this live but to gain a lot more in the afterlife. Therefore, a discussion of the elements of religious fundamentalism, especially in view of its millennialist and apocalyptic elements, is supposed to visualize possible points of reference regarding a deconstruction of the jihadist misuse of the pandemic. This approach could be helpful in terms of a change of perspective for those who are (still) addicted to the violence promoting ideology of IS. © 2021 transcript Verlag, Bielefeld.

Two most commonly used classifiers were selected: logistic regression (LR) and convolutional neural networks (CNN). The main reason was to make the system fast and efficient. Moreover, a dimensionality reduction approach was also investigated based on principal component analysis (PCA) to further speed up the learning process and improve the classification accuracy by selecting the highly discriminate features. The deep learning-based methods demand large amount of training samples compared to conventional approaches, yet adequate amount of labelled training samples was not available for COVID-19 X-ray images. Therefore, data augmentation technique using generative adversarial network (GAN) was employed to further increase the training samples and reduce the overfitting problem. We used the online available dataset and incorporated GAN to have 500 X-ray images in total for this study. Both CNN and LR showed encouraging results for COVID-19 patient identification.

364051,364051,364051,On A New Conceptual Mathematical Model Dealing the Current Novel Coronavirus-19 Infectious Disease,14.748116,5.750606,2020,"The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, caused by SARS-CoV-2, constitutes a tremendous global health issue. Continuous monitoring of the virus has become a cornerstone to make rational decisions on implementing societal and sanitary measures to curtail the virus spread. Additionally, emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants have increased the need for genomic surveillance to detect particular strains because of their potentially increased transmissibility, pathogenicity and immune escape. Targeted SARS-CoV-2 sequencing of wastewater has been explored as an epidemiological surveillance method for the competent authorities. Few quality criteria are however available when sequencing wastewater samples, and those available typically only pertain to constructing the consensus genome sequence. Multiple variants circulating in the population can however be simultaneously present in wastewater samples. The performance, including detection and quantification of low-abundant variants, of whole genome sequencing (WGS) of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater samples remains largely unknown. Here, we evaluated the detection and quantification of mutations present at low abundances using the SARS-CoV-2 lineage B.1.1.7 (alpha variant) defining mutations as a case study. Real sequencing data were in silico modified by introducing mutations of interest into raw wild-type sequencing data, or by mixing wild-type and mutant raw sequencing data, to mimic wastewater samples subjected to WGS using a tiling amplicon-based targeted metagenomics approach and Illumina sequencing. As anticipated, higher variation, lower sensitivity and more false negatives, were observed at lower coverages and allelic frequencies. We found that detection of all low-frequency variants at an abundance of 10%, 5%, 3% and 1%, requires at least a sequencing coverage of 250X, 500X, 1500X and 10,000X, respectively. Although increasing variability of estimated allelic frequencies at decreasing coverages and lower allelic frequencies was observed, its impact on reliable quantification was limited. This study provides a highly sensitive low-frequency variant detection approach, which is publicly available at https://galaxy.sciensano.be, and specific recommendations for minimum sequencing coverages to detect clade-defining mutations at specific allelic frequencies.","Poelvoorde, Laura A.

Objective: To evaluate early surgical outcomes of patients with COVID-19 in different subspecialties. Design, Setting, and Participants: This matched cohort study conducted in the general, vascular and thoracic surgery, orthopedic, and neurosurgery units of Spedali Civili Hospital (Brescia, Italy) included patients who underwent surgical treatment from February 23 to April 1, 2020, and had positive test results for COVID-19 either before or within 1 week after surgery. Gynecological and minor surgical procedures were excluded. Patients with COVID-19 were matched with patients without COVID-19 with a 1:2 ratio for sex, age group, American Society of Anesthesiologists score, and comorbidities recorded in the surgical risk calculator of the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program. Patients older than 65 years were also matched for the Clinical Frailty Scale score. Exposures: Patients with positive results for COVID-19 and undergoing surgery vs matched surgical patients without infection. Screening for COVID-19 was performed with reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction assay in nasopharyngeal swabs, chest radiography, and/or computed tomography. Diagnosis of COVID-19 was based on positivity of at least 1 of these investigations. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary end point was early surgical mortality and complications in patients with COVID-19; secondary end points were the modeling of complications to determine the importance of COVID-19 compared with other surgical risk factors. Results: Of 41 patients (of 333 who underwent operation during the same period) who underwent mainly urgent surgery, 33 (80.5%) had positive results for COVID-19 preoperatively and 8 (19.5%) had positive results within 5 days from surgery. Of the 123 patients of the combined cohorts (78 women [63.4%]; mean [SD] age, 76.6 [14.4] years), 30-day mortality was significantly higher for those with COVID-19 compared with control patients without COVID-19 (odds ratio [OR], 9.5; 95% CI, 1.77-96.53). Complications were also significantly higher (OR, 4.98; 95% CI, 1.81-16.07); pulmonary complications were the most common (OR, 35.62; 95% CI, 9.34-205.55), but thrombotic complications were also significantly associated with COVID-19 (OR, 13.2; 95% CI, 1.48-&#8734;). Different models (cumulative link model and classification tree) identified COVID-19 as the main variable associated with complications. Conclusions and Relevance: In this matched cohort study, surgical mortality and complications were higher in patients with COVID-19 compared with patients without COVID-19. These data suggest that, whenever possible, surgery should be postponed in patients with COVID-19.","Doglietto, Francesco; Vezzoli, Marika; Gheza, Federico; Lussardi, Gian Luca; Domenicucci, Marco; Vecchiarelli, Luca; Zanin, Luca; Saraceno, Giorgio; Signorini, Liana; Panciani, Pier Paolo; Castelli, Francesco; Maroldi, Roberto; Rasulo, Francesco Antonio; Benvenuti, Mauro Roberto; Portolani, Nazario; Bonardelli, Stefano; Milano, Giuseppe; Casiraghi, Alessandro; Calza, Stefano; Fontanella, Marco Maria",JAMA surg.

In this cross-section study we evaluated COVID-19 seroprevalence in military police forces of 10 major cities in Rio Grande do Sul, South of Brazil. METHODS: Sampling was randomly performed in clusters, in respect to the number of professionals at service per city and military unit. Research subjects were evaluated on July 23, 2020 (first wave peak in Brazil). Clinical information was obtained, and venous blood was taken for ELISA testing (IgA, and IgG antibodies). Sample size consisted of 1,592 military workers (33.6% of study population). They were mostly man (81.2%) and young (median 34 years-old). Most had been asymptomatic (75.3%) during pandemic, and 27.5% reported close contact with COVID-19 cases (after a median time of 21 days). Antibodies were detected in 3.3% of the participants, mostly IgA (2.7%), and IgG (1.7%). After 3 weeks, 66.7% of IgA and IgG results turned negative, in addition to 78.3% and 100% of borderline IgA and IgG results, respectively. CONCLUSION: The seroprevalence of COVID-19 amongst military police was at least 3.4 higher than the findings of other studies performed in the general population, in the same cities and dates. Most detectable antibodies were of IgA class, which implies recent exposure. Asymptomatic people were more prone to have negative antibody titters in the second run.","Pasqualotto, Alessandro C; Pereira, Paula de Castro; Lana, Daiane F Dalla; Schwarzbold, Alexandre V; Ribeiro, Marco S; Riche, Cezar V W; Castro, Cristiani Pilati P; Korsack, Paula L; Ferreira, Paulo Emilio B; Domingues, Guilherme de C; Ribeiro, Giorgia T; Carneiro, Marcelo; Caurio, Cassia Ferreira B; Vasconcellos, Izadora Clezar da S; Knebel, Lidiana M; Zamberlan, Lucas; Stolz, Andressa P; Vilanova, Macarthur; Watte, Guilherme; Kalil, Antonio N",PLoS One,188,20

METHODS: According to the time of the implementation of the new night shift schedule, we divided all patients into two groups: initial period group and recent period group. The clinical electronic medical records, nursing records, laboratory findings, and radiological examinations for all patients with laboratory confirmed Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection were reviewed. Cox proportional hazard ratio (HR) models were used to determine the risk factors associated with in hospital death. RESULTS: A total of 75 patients were included in this study. Initial period group includes 45 patients and recent period group includes 30 patients. The difference in mortality between the two groups was significant, 77.8% and 36.7%, respectively. Leukocytosis at admission and admitted to hospital before the new night shift schedule were associated with increased odds of death. CONCLUSIONS: Shift arrangement of medical staff are associated with the mortality of critically ill patients with COVID-19.

These viruses have a potential and tendency to cross-species barriers and infect humans. Novel human coronavirus 2019-nCoV (hCoV-19) emerged from Wuhan, China, and has caused a global pandemic. Genomic features of SARS-CoV-2 may attribute inter-species transmission and adaptation to a novel host, and therefore is imperative to explicate the evolutionary dynamics of the viral genome and its propensity for differential host selection. We conducted an in silico analysis of all the coding gene sequences of SARS-CoV-2 strains (n = 39) originating from a range of non-human mammalian species, including pangolin, bat, dog, cat, tiger, mink, mouse, and the environmental samples such as wastewater, air and surface samples from the door handle and seafood market. Compared to the reference SARS-CoV-2 strain (MN908947; Wuhan-Hu-1), phylogenetic and comparative residue analysis revealed the circulation of three variants, including hCoV-19 virus from humans and two hCoV-19-related precursors from bats and pangolins. A lack of obvious differences as well as a maximum genetic homology among dog-, cat-, tiger-, mink-, mouse-, bat- and pangolin-derived SARS-CoV-2 sequences suggested a likely evolution of these strains from a common ancestor. Several residue substitutions were observed in the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein, concluding a promiscuous nature of the virus for host species where genomic alternations may be required for the adaptation to novel host/s. However, such speculation needs in vitro investigations to unleash the influence of substitutions towards species-jump and disease pathogenesis.","Ul-Rahman, Aziz; Shabbir, Muhammad Abu Bakr; Aziz, Muhammad Waqar; Yaqub, Saima; Mehmood, Asif; Raza, Muhammad Asif; Shabbir, Muhammad Zubair",Mol Biol Rep,188,16

Pharmacotherapy is one of the most common strategies to reduce neck pain in patients. The aim of this study was to analyze the real-world pattern of drugs prescribed for patients with neck pain in the USA. METHODS: Data on individuals who reported current neck pain in the 2009-2010 US National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) and with a history of persistent pain for at least 6 weeks or 3 months were extracted from the NHANES database. Those included in the study were divided into three groups based on the duration of pain: the without neck pain group (Group A); subacute group (Group B) with a history of 6 weeks of neck pain; and the chronic neck pain group (Group C) with a history of 3 months of neck pain. The use and duration of medication prescribed for Group A, B, and C patients were compared. RESULTS: The analysis revealed that opioid use was significantly more prevalent in the subacute and chronic neck pain group than in the without neck pain group (Group A) (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 4.20, 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.07-8.52 and aOR 7.00, 95% CI 4.32-11.33, respectively). The factors strongly associated with higher opioid use included older age, low education level, and low family income. In the chronic neck group, opioids, followed in decreasing order of frequency by acetaminophen and nonsteroidal anti-infammatory drugs, were the most common analgesics used in combination with other analgesics. CONCLUSION: Our analysis of the data shows that the long-term excessive use of opioids and the underutilization of other analgesics are two major issues in the treatment of neck pain in the USA. Possible improvements include improved education of patients by healthcare professionals on the use of opioids and more consideration given to non-pharmacotherapy options. Our results reveal the potential problem in pharmacotherapy choices for neck pain treatment and may help improve the current clinical practice in the USA and other countries.","Huang, Jin-Feng; Meng, Zhou; Zheng, Xuan-Qi; Qin, Zongshi; Sun, Xiao-Lei; Zhang, Kai; Tian, Hai-Jun; Wang, Xiao-Bing; Gao, Ze; Li, Yan Michael; Wu, Ai-Min",,188,1

MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study included 65 patients with primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) who sought medical aid at the Ophthalmological Center of FMBA during the COVID-19 pandemic; they were examined using three tonometry methods: RBT, TPT and CDT. All patients underwent central corneal thickness measurement, perimetry, OCT and OCTA with assessment of vessel density (VD) of the superficial plexus in the macula (whole image macula) and peripapillary retina (PPR). RESULTS: High correlation was found between the results obtained with RBT, TPT and CDT. None of the methods showed a correlation between IOP and corneal thickness. The correlations between IOP and OCTA parameters were obtained: IOPTPT and VDPPR in the inferior temporal sector (r= -0.386, p=0.027), IOPRBT and VD whole image macula (r= -0.69, p=0.019), and in the macula inferior hemisphere (r= -0.75, p=0.008), as well as between the ocular pulse amplitude (OPA) and VD in the macular inferior hemisphere (r=0.380, p=0.039). The OCTA parameters had a moderate, but significant correlation with the perimetric indices. CONCLUSIONS: Tonometry methods (TPB, CDT and RBT) exhibit high correlation with each other and no correlation with corneal thickness.

The combination of these tonometry methods with SD-OCT and OCTA is optimal for examining patients during the pandemic.","Kurysheva, N I; Pechenkina, A A; Goncharova, A S",Vestn Oftalmol,188,16

This paper describes the center's response from mid-March through June 30, 2020. METHODS: A comprehensive needs assessment was conducted with agricultural stakeholders. Agriculture-specific COVID-19 resources were developed and disseminated, and a farmer/employer survey was launched. RESULTS: The WCAHS COVID-19 resources web page, worksite checklist, and training guide were shared on over 50 web pages nationally. As of June 30, 2020, 282 online surveys have been received. Ongoing informal discussions with agricultural stakeholders indicate a disconnect between the experiences of farmers/employers and farmworkers in relation to COVID-19 prevention at the worksite. Initial survey responses indicate that implementing social distancing is one of the greatest challenges at the worksite. Confusion over local, state, and federal guidelines and which to follow is another concern. CONCLUSION: The WCAHS response to COVID-19, in close collaboration with agricultural stakeholders, represents a useful model for a rapid response to a public health crisis by regional centers. Key elements to its success include rapid personalized communication with a wide range of agricultural stakeholders, an actively engaged External Advisory Board, the development of industry-specific resources and information, recurring and iterative engagement with stakeholders as new COVID-19 information emerged and resources were developed, and the identification of the unique gap WCAHS was positioned to fill. The multipronged dissemination approach enhanced the reach of WCAHS COVID-19 resources.","Riden, Heather E; Schilli, Kara; Pinkerton, Kent E",J Agromedicine,188,26

Point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) imaging has been proposed as a screening tool as it is a much cheaper and easier to apply imaging modality than others that are traditionally used for pulmonary examinations, namely chest x-ray and computed tomography. Given the scarcity of expert radiologists for interpreting POCUS examinations in many highly affected regions around the world, low-cost deep learning-driven clinical decision support solutions can have a large impact during the on-going pandemic. Motivated by this, we introduce COVID-Net US, a highly efficient, self-attention deep convolutional neural network design tailored for COVID-19 screening from lung POCUS images. Experimental results show that the proposed COVID-Net US can achieve an AUC of over 0.98 while achieving 353X lower architectural complexity, 62X lower computational complexity, and 14.3X faster inference times on a Raspberry Pi. Clinical validation was also conducted, where select cases were reviewed and reported on by a practicing clinician (20 years of clinical practice) specializing in intensive care (ICU) and 15 years of expertise in POCUS interpretation. To advocate affordable healthcare and artificial intelligence for resource-constrained environments, we have made COVID-Net US open source and publicly available as part of the COVID-Net open source initiative.","MacLean, Alexander; Abbasi, Saad; Ebadi, Ashkan; Zhao, Andy; Pavlova, Maya; Gunraj, Hayden; Xi, Pengcheng; Kohli, Sonny; Wong, Alexander",,188,16

Informed by sociolinguistics and Computer-mediated Discourse Analysis theory (Herring, 2004), this contribution compares the colleagues’ usual moments of sharing on WhatsApp with their interactions using the same medium during three extraordinary online moments of sharing, which are also significant off-line moments for the group. These three special moments of sharing took place after the terrorist attacks in Manchester in May 2017 and in Turku in August 2017, and the outbreak of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic in Europe in March 2020. An examination of the messages exchanged during these extraordinary moments provides considerable evidence that moment, style and audience engagement are closely intertwined. While graphical elements, such as emoji, as well as textese language, are pragmatically unmarked in the typical practices of the community, their absence is the marked choice during the three special moments of sharing analysed. Importantly, the study also shows that code-switching is a key strategy to demonstrate group solidarity during moments of sharing that are special and highly significant for the participants.","Pérez-Sabater, Carmen",Journal of Pragmatics,188,14

We report the case of an eight-year-old boy with new-onset type 1 diabetes and an asymptomatic COVID-19 infection. Case presentation: The eight-year-old boy was hospitalized on December 18th, 2020 due to increased polyuria during the preceding 1 week. Type 1 diabetes was diagnosed with autoantibodies against glutamic acid decarboxylase, tyrosine phosphatase and insulin. The Hba1c value was 11.6%. Upon admission, the PCR test for COVID-19 was positive, the duration of the infection was not clear due to the asymptomatic course, and antibodies were initially negative. Significantly elevated antibodies against COVID-19 were detected 15 days later. Conclusion: The laboratory findings led us to the hypothesis that the boy already had an increased risk of developing autoimmune diseases (HLA DR3-DQB1*02:01 and DR4-DQB1*03:02 positive). The Hba1c value allows speculation that the diabetes manifestation was already ""on the way"" and that a relatively recent COVID-19 infection could have accelerated the process. The findings are in contrast to a recent report in which COVID-19 infection preceded the manifestation of an insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus by about 5-7 weeks. Due to the paucity of reports, cases with a suspected connection between diabetes mellitus and COVID-19 infection should be entered into the CoviDiab registry (https://covidiab.e-dendrite.com).","Kastner, R.; Harsch, I.

Considering the various uncertainties and unknowns about this virus and its impacts (especially long-term impacts), it is critical to understand opinions and suggestions from experts within the transport sector and related planning fields. To date, however, there is no study that fills this gap in a comprehensive way. This paper is an executive summary of the findings of the WCTRS COVID-19 Taskforce expert survey conducted worldwide between the end of April and late May 2020, obtaining 284 valid answers. The experts include those in the field of transport and other relevant disciplines, keeping good balances between geographic regions, types of workplaces, and working durations. Based on extensive analyses of the survey results, this paper first reveals the realities of lockdowns, restrictions of out-of-home activities and other physical distancing requirements, as well as modal shifts. Experts' agreements and disagreements to the structural questions about changes in lifestyles and society are then discussed. Analysis results revealed that our human society was not well prepared for the current pandemic, reaffirming the importance of risk communication. Geographical differences of modal shifts are further identified, especially related to active transport and car dependence. Improved sustainability and resilience are expected in the future but should be supported by effective behavioral intervention measures. Finally, policy implications of the findings are discussed, together with important future research issues.","Zhang, Junyi; Hayashi, Yoshitsugu; Frank, Lawrence D",,188,24

Considering that Rosen made extensive use of mathematics it might seem surprising that his ideas have only rarely been implemented in mathematical models. On the one hand, Rosen propagates relational models that neglect underlying structural details of the components and focus on relationships between the elements of a biological system, according to the motto""throw away the physics, keep the organisation"". Rosen's strong rejection of mechanistic models that he implicitly associates with a strong form of reductionism might have deterred mathematical modellers from adopting his ideas for their own work. On the other hand Rosen's presentation of his modelling framework, (M,R) systems, is highly abstract which makes it hard to appreciate how this approach could be applied to concrete biological problems. In this article, both the mathematics as well as those aspects of Rosen's work are analysed that relate to his philosophical ideas. It is shown that Rosen's relational models are a particular type of mechanistic model with specific underlying assumptions rather than a different kind of model that excludes mechanistic models. The strengths and weaknesses of relational models are investigated by comparison with current network biology literature. Finally, it is argued that Rosen's definition of life,""organisms are closed to efficient causation"", should be considered as a hypothesis to be tested and ideas how this postulate could be implemented in mathematical models are presented.","Siekmann, Ivo",,188,1

DESIGN: Prospective cross-sectional study METHODSSETTING: Single-center STUDY POPULATION: Fifteen healthy subjects were recruited INTERVENTION: Each participant was instructed not to speak for 2-minutes, simulating a ""no-talking"" policy, while in an ophthalmic examination chair with an blood agar plate secured to the forehead and wearing various face masks (no mask, loose fitting surgical mask, tight-fitting surgical mask without tape, tight-fitting surgical mask with adhesive tape securing the superior portion of the mask, N95 mask, and cloth mask). Each scenario was then repeated while reading a 2-minute script, simulating a talking patient. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Number of colony-forming units (CFU) and microbial species. RESULTS: During the ""no-talking"" scenario, subjects wearing a tight-fitting surgical mask with tape developed fewer CFUs compared to subjects wearing the same mask without tape (difference, 0.93CFU; 95%CI, 0.32-1.55; P=.003).

These events exemplify dismaying truths about race and equality in the United States. Racial health disparities are an inexcusable lesion on the U.S. health care system. Many health disparities involve medications, including antidepressants, anticoagulants, diabetes medications, drugs for dementia, and statins, to name a few. Managed care pharmacy has a role in perpetuating racial disparities in medication use. For example, pharmacy benefit designs are increasingly shifting costs of expensive medications to patients, creating affordability crises for lower income workers, who are disproportionally persons of color. In addition, the quest to maximize rebates serves to inflate list prices paid by the uninsured, among which Black and Hispanic people are overrepresented. While medication cost is a foremost barrier for many patients, other factors also propagate racial disparities in medication use. Even when cost sharing is minimal or zero, medication adherence rates have been documented to be lower among Blacks as compared with Whites. Deeper understandings are needed about how racial disparities in medication use are influenced by factors such as culture, provider bias, and patient trust in medical advice. Managed care pharmacy can address racial disparities in medication use in several ways. First, it should be acknowledged that racial disparities in medication use are pervasive and must be resolved urgently. We must not believe that entrenched health system, societal, and political structures are impermeable to change. Second, the voices of community members and their advocates must be amplified. Coverage policies, program designs, and quality initiatives should be developed in consultation with those directly affected by racial disparities. Third, the industry should commit to dramatically reducing patient cost sharing for essential medication therapies. Federal and state efforts to limit annual out-of-pocket pharmacy spending should be supported, even though increased premiums may be an undesirable (yet more equitable) consequence. Finally, information about race should be incorporated into all internal and external reporting and quality improvement activities.

We assessed the effect of the pandemic on the disruption of institutional delivery care in Nepal. Methods: We conducted a prospective cohort study among 52 356 women in nine hospitals to assess the disruption of institutional delivery care during the pandemic (comparing March to August in 2019 with the same months in 2020). We also conducted a nested follow up cohort study with 2022 women during the pandemic to assess their provision and experience of respectful care. We used linear regression models to assess the association between provision and experience of care with volume of hospital births and women's residence in a COVID-19 hotspot area. Results: The mean institutional births during the pandemic across the nine hospitals was 24 563, an average decrease of 11.6% (P < 0.0001) in comparison to the same time-period in 2019. The institutional birth in high-medium volume hospitals declined on average by 20.8% (P < 0.0001) during the pandemic, whereas in low-volume hospital institutional birth increased on average by 7.9% (P = 0.001). Maternity services halted for a mean of 4.3 days during the pandemic and there was a redeployment staff to COVID-19 dedicated care. Respectful provision of care was better in hospitals with low-volume birth (ß = 0.446, P < 0.0001) in comparison to high-medium-volume hospitals. There was a positive association between women's residence in a COVID-19 hotspot area and respectful experience of care (ß = 0.076, P = 0.001). Conclusions: The COVID-19 pandemic has had differential effects on maternity services with changes varying by the volume of births per hospital with smaller volume facilities doing better. More research is needed to investigate the effects of the pandemic on where women give birth and their provision and experience of respectful maternity care to inform a ""building-back-better"" approach in post-pandemic period.","Ashish, K C; Peterson, Stefan Swartling; Gurung, Rejina; Skalkidou, Alkistis; Gautam, Jageshwar; Malla, Honey; Paudel, Punya; Bhattarai, Kumari; Joshi, Nisha; Tinkari, Bhim Singh; Adhikari, Shree; Shrestha, Durgalaxmi; Ghimire, Binda; Sharma, Seema; Khanal, Laxmi; Shrestha, Sunil; Graham, Wendy Jane; Kinney, Mary",J Glob Health,188,23

The authors analyzed changes in clinical drug testing patterns and results at a national clinical laboratory, comparing data obtained before and during the pandemic. Testing for prescription and illicit drugs declined rapidly during the pandemic, with weekly test volumes falling by approximately 70% from the baseline period to the trough (the week beginning March 29) before rising in subsequent weeks. Among individuals tested, positivity increased by 35% for non-prescribed fentanyl and 44% for heroin during the pandemic. Positivity for non-prescribed fentanyl increased significantly among patients positive for other drugs: by 89% for specimens positive for amphetamines; 48% for benzodiazepines; 34% for cocaine; and 39% for opiates (P < 0.01 for all comparisons). These findings suggest significant increases in dangerous drug combinations. Positivity for non-prescribed use of many other drugs remained consistent or declined for some drugs, relative to pre-pandemic patterns. Models adjusting for potential confounding variables, including medication-assisted treatment and treatment at a substance use disorder facility indicated that the risk for non-prescribed fentanyl positivity rose by more than 50% during the pandemic. In summary, these findings demonstrate decreased drug testing overall, with increased positivity for high-risk drugs and dangerous drug combinations. The convergence of the drug abuse epidemic and COVID-19 pandemic has led to an increased need for health care and public health resources dedicated to supporting vulnerable patients and addressing the underlying causes of these disturbing trends.","Niles, Justin K; Gudin, Jeffrey; Radcliff, Jeff; Kaufman, Harvey W",Popul. health manag.

To block the propagation of infectious diseases, an effective contact tracing mechanism needs to be implemented. Unfortunately, existing schemes have severe privacy issues that jeopardize the identity-privacy and location-privacy for both users and patients. Although some privacy-preserving systems have been proposed, there remain several issues caused by centralization. To mitigate this issues, we propose a Privacy-preserving contact Tracing scheme in 5G-integrated and Blockchain-based Medical applications, named PTBM. In PTBM, the 5G-integrated network is leveraged as the underlying infrastructure where everyone can perform location checking with his mobile phones or even wearable devices connected to 5G network to find whether they have been in possible contact with a diagnosed patient without violating their privacy. A trusted medical center can effectively trace the patients and their corresponding close contacts. Thorough security and performance analysis show that the proposed PTBM scheme achieves privacy protection, traceability, reliability, and authentication, with high computation & communication efficiency and low latency.","Zhang, Can; Xu, Chang; Sharif, Kashif; Zhu, Liehuang",Comput Stand Interfaces,188,1

However, it is also currently under discussion whether patients under immunosuppressive therapy also have a higher risk of suffering a severe course of the COVID-19 disease. In principle though, there is currently no data available for a general reduction or pause of immunosuppression in patients with autoimmune diseases because of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. However, since there is currently neither an effective therapy nor corresponding vaccination protection, the indication for a prolonged immunosuppressive therapy should be made with special care. In particular, immunotherapeutic agents that produce long-term effects (e.g., rituximab) should be used with special caution. In contrast, immunomodulating substances that do not suppress antiviral immunity (e.g. systemic immunoglobulins, doxycycline), or that have intrinsic effects on SARS-CoV-2 (calcineurin inhibitors, chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine) may be useful alternatives.","Grabbe, Stephan; Beissert, Stefan; Enk, Alexander",J.

ambulancia es un transporte sanitario esencial para proporcionar asistencia médica de emergencia o de soporte vital básico en situaciones de atención primario como interhospitalario Este medio a su vez está equipada de materiales sanitarios y del personal sanitario abordo quienes prestan asistencia de acuerdo a las necesidades de atención en situaciones de emergencia Asimismo, es importante señalar que muchos hospitales cuentan con un servicio propio para el traslado de los pacientes, por lo tanto, se requiere de la disponibilidad del manejo de los procedimientos de desinfección y limpieza de la ambulancia, principalmente para evitar la propagación del COVID-19 Los profesionales de la salud están capacitados para prestar la atención médica a los pacientes en casos sospechosos y confirmados, de esta manera es muy importante que el personal esté capacitado y entrenado para desinfectar y limpiar la ambulancia, para garantizar la seguridad de los pacientes y su equipo de profesionales a bordo Estudios recientes han permitido evidenciar que las superficies de las ambulancias están frecuentemente contaminadas con microorganismos (2,24) Por ello, la desinfección es una parte importante de cualquier procedimiento de control y prevención de infecciones Ante la crisis de COVID-19 a nivel mundial, el seguir procedimientos de limpieza y desinfección de ambulancias es vital para reducir la carga biológica del SARS-CoV-2 y evitar más infectados (3) una vez que un paciente con sospecha de COVID-19 ha sido transportado El SARS-CoV-2 tiene una envoltura lipídica, por lo que una amplia gama de desinfectantes resulta muy efectiva, para asegurar una completa y adecuada desinfección de todas las superficies expuestas, equipos y áreas de contacto, antes de volver a las tareas operativas normales En la actualidad existen diversos protocolos efectivos de limpieza y desinfección para este entorno de atención primaria de emergencia En varios países, se ha estado trabajando en la elaboración de protocolos y guías con procedimientos precisos para desinfectar y limpiar la ambulancia A partir de estos instrumentos, señalamos las pautas generales seguidas por dichos países como medida de prevención y control, en relación a los procedimientos seguidos para la desinfección de ambulancias MÉTODOS: Se realizó una revisión narrativa de las principales bases de datos de investigación, documentos, artículos y guías relacionadas a los procedimientos de limpieza y desinfección de ambulancias durante y después del transporte de algún caso sospechoso o confirmado de COVID-19 En este documento se incluyó principalmente información científica actualizada de los departamentos gubernamentales de los países del reino unido como GOB UK, la guía de prevención y control de infecciones en entornos sanitarios, como también, la guía de fideicomisos de ambulancias y recomendaciones de la Organización Mundial de la Salud (OMS) Sobre los procedimientos de limpieza y desinfección de las ambulancias después del transporte de un paciente con COVID-19, se revisaron las recomendaciones más actuales del Centro para el Control y Prevención de Enfermedades de los Estados Unidos (CDC), también se incluyeron textos de la guía de prevención y control de infecciones para COVID-19 enlos entornos sanitarios del Centro Europeo de Prevención y Control de Enfermedades (ECDC), y el manual de bioseguridad para prestadores de servicios de salud que brinden atención en salud ante la eventual introducción del nuevo coronavirus (ncov-2019) a Colombia Esta revisión incluye, además, información técnica respecto a la atención primaria ante el nuevo coronavirus y algunas recomendaciones de limpieza y desinfección de vehículos de transporte del equipo de EMS como la guía recientemente actualizada por el equipo de trabajo sobre coronavirus de la asociación Internacional de Jebes de Bomberos (International Association of Fire Chiefs - IAFC) RESULTADOS: Existe la urgencia internacional para contener e virus y prevenir su propagación Es factible que el personal de salud de primera línea, como los que conforman el equipo de ambulancias para el traslado de pacientes sospechosos o confirmados por SARS-Cov-2, estén potencialmente expuestos al contagio (12) Por ello, es necesario que cada entidad sanitaria mantenga un estándar de bioseguridad para el procedimiento de limpieza y desinfección de ambulancias, manteniendo un protocolo que ayude a prevenir los riesgos de infección para el personal de salud de esta área Actualmente conocemos que, la transmisión de SARS-Cov-2, se da por medio de las gotitas respiratorias (14) y que al ser liberadas alcanzan hasta un metro de distancia pueden depositarse en diferentes superficies y aun permanecer activas Para ello, una amplia gama de productos biocidas están disponibles para desinfectar superficies en diferentes ámbitos sanitarios y en las ambulancias (5,15) Kampf y col han observado que otros coronavirus, por ejemplo, SARS y MERS, pueden persistir en superficies inanimadas como metal, vidrio o plástico por hasta 9 días, pero pueden ser desactivados eficientemente por procedimientos de desinfección con etanol al 62­71%, peróxido de hidrógeno al 0 5%, o hipoclorito de sodio al 0 1% dentro de 1 min Otros agentes biocidas como el cloruro de benzalconio al 0 05% a 0 2% o digluconato de clorhexidina al 0 02% fueron menos eficaces (16,17) Duan y col encontraron que la irradiación con luz ultra violeta (LUV) durante 60 minutos en varios coronavirus en medio cultivo dio como resultado niveles indetectables de infectividad viral Un estudio cuasi-experimental Iraní, realizó toma de muestras antes y después de la desinfección en la cabina delantera, equipo médico y parte trasera de ambulancias para determinar contaminaciones microbianas, para ello utilizó la solución &quot;Cloruro de didecildimetilamonio, alquil dimetil bencil amonio, una base de compuestos de amonio cuaternario de quinta generación y biguanidas&quot;;demostrando su acción bactericida hasta en un 100% luego de la desinfección, por lo que el producto resultó ser eficaz en la eliminación de bacterias El mismo estudio revela la limitación de no haber podido probar tal eficacia en virus, hongos o esporas No existen estudios específicos referidos a la efectividad y seguridad de diversos desinfectantes para la descontaminación de las ambulancias y sus equipos biomédicos por SARS-CoV-2 Las medidas adoptadas por diferentes países se basan en las recomendaciones de la OMS, CDC y de países de alta vigilancia epidemiológica Es importante mencionar que, estas recomendaciones tienen como fuente de información las experiencias referidas al SARS-CoV y MERS-CoV y los diferentes estudios que encontraron que en superficies inanimadas los agentes biocidas comúnmente utilizados como desinfectantes, obtuvieron alta eficacia contra estos vírus La OMS/OPS recomienda el uso de desinfectantes como el hipoclorito de sodio, amonio cuaternario, peróxido de hidrogeno, etanol y clorhexidina;en el área intrahospitalaria (incluyendo las ambulancias);pero dependiendo de las áreas específicas del entorno, estas podrán variar de concentración y dilución Estos desinfectantes presentan actividad frente a la mayoría de los virus, incluyendo coronavirus y SARS, siempre que sean preparados de acuerdo con las instrucciones del fabricante (los virus con envoltura como el coronavirus son más susceptibles a los detergentes que los virus no envueltos) El adecuado uso de antisépticos y desinfectantes, es una herramienta esencial para evitar la diseminación de agentes infecciosos y el control de infecciones asociadas a la atención de salud Por ello, es imprescindible seguir las recomendaciones de entidades de alta vigilancia epidemiológica y valorar la evidencia científica CONCLUSIONES: Este documento proporciona información para la limpieza y desinfección de ambulancias, brindada por entidades de alta vigilancia epidemiológica contra infecciones emergentes, basados en evidencia científica, pa a los servicios de emergencia sanitaria que dispongan de ambulancias destinadas para el transporte de casos sospechosos y confirmados de COVID-19 No existen estudios específicos referidos a la efectividad y seguridad de diversos desinfectantes para la descontaminación de las ambulancias y sus equipos

This analysis compares person-based contact tracing among two populations in Salt Lake County, Utah, from March-May 2020. METHODS: All laboratory-confirmed positive cases among PEH (n = 169) and documented in Utah's surveillance system were included in this analysis. The general population comparison group (n = 163) were systematically selected from all laboratory-confirmed cases identified during the same period. RESULTS: Ninety-three PEH cases (55%) were interviewed compared to 163 (100%) cases among the general population (P < .0001). PEH were more likely to be lost to follow-up at end of isolation (14.2%) versus the general population (0%; P-value < .0001) and provided fewer contacts per case (0.3) than the general population (4.7) (P-value < .0001).

Angiogenesis is a basic process that occurs during tumor growth and metastasis. The vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)/VEGF receptor (VEGFR) pathway is a key regulator of angiogenesis. The aim of the present study was to evaluate whether fisetin affects angiogenesis through the VEGFR pathway. In the present study, Y79 cells were treated with 100 ng/ml VEGF in the presence of fisetin at concentrations of 0, 25, 50 and 100 µM. A Cell Counting Kit-8 assay was used to detect proliferation and the Transwell and Matrigel assays were used to assess cell migration and invasion, respectively. Reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis was applied to measure the expression level of VEGFR mRNA and western blot analysis was used to measure the protein expression of VEGFR. An immunofluorescence assay was used to detect the expression of VEGFR. Angiogenesis in vitro was assessed by a tube formation assay. The results demonstrated that fisetin significantly inhibited the proliferation of Y79 cells in a time- and dose-dependent manner. Fisetin also inhibited the migration and invasion of Y79 cells in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, fisetin inhibited the expression of VEGFR in Y79 cells in a dose-dependent manner and tumor angiogenesis in vitro. Thus, fisetin was found to inhibit angiogenesis via inhibition of the VEGF/VEGFR signaling pathway, and could be used as a candidate drug to inhibit angiogenesis in retinoblastoma.","Wang, Liangjun; Chen, Ning; Cheng, Hongxia",Oncol Lett,188,1

The burden on hospitals during the pandemic could be reduced by implementing prediction models that can discriminate between patients requiring hospitalization and those who do not. The COVID-19 vulnerability (C-19) index, a model that predicts which patients will be admitted to hospital for treatment of pneumonia or pneumonia proxies, has been developed and proposed as a valuable tool for decision making during the pandemic. However, the model is at high risk of bias according to the ""prediction model risk of bias assessment"" criteria and has not been externally validated. OBJECTIVE: Externally validate the C-19 index across a range of healthcare settings to determine how well it broadly predicts hospitalization due to pneumonia in COVID-19 cases. METHODS: We followed the OHDSI framework for external validation to assess the reliability of the C-19 model. We evaluated the model on two different target populations: i) 41,381 patients that have SARS-CoV-2 at an outpatient or emergency room visit and ii) 9,429,285 patients that have influenza or related symptoms during an outpatient or emergency room visit, to predict their risk of hospitalization with pneumonia during the following 0 to 30 days. In total we validated the model across a network of 14 databases spanning the US, Europe, Australia and Asia. RESULTS: The internal validation performance of the C-19 index was a c-statistic of 0.73 and calibration was not reported by the authors. When we externally validated it by transporting it to SARS-CoV-2 data the model obtained c-statistics of 0.36, 0.53 (0.473-0.584) and 0.56 (0.488-0.636) on Spanish, US and South Korean datasets respectively. The calibration was poor with the model under-estimating risk. When validated on 12 datasets containing influenza patients across the OHDSI network the c-statistics ranged between 0.40-0.68. CONCLUSIONS: The results show that the discriminative performance of the C-19 model is low for influenza cohorts, and even worse amongst COVID-19 patients in the US, Spain and South Korea. These results suggest that C-19 should not be used to aid decision making during the COVID-19 pandemic. Our findings highlight the importance of performing external validation across a range of settings, especially when a prediction model is being extrapolated to a different population. In the field of prediction, extensive validation is required to create appropriate trust in a model.","Reps, Jenna M; Kim, Chungsoo; Williams, Ross D; Markus, Aniek F; Yang, Cynthia; Salles, Talita Duarte; Falconer, Thomas; Jonnagaddala, Jitendra; Williams, Andrew; Fernández-Bertolín, Sergio; DuVall, Scott L; Kostka, Kristin; Rao, Gowtham; Shoaibi, Azza; Ostropolets, Anna; Spotnitz, Matthew E; Zhang, Lin; Casajust, Paula; Steyerberg, Ewout W; Nyberg, Fredrik; Kaas-Hansen, Benjamin Skov; Choi, Young Hwa; Morales, Daniel; Liaw, Siaw-Teng; Abrahão, Maria Tereza Fernandes; Areia, Carlos; Matheny, Michael E; Aragón, María; Park, Rae Woong; Hripcsak, George; Reich, Christian G; Suchard, Marc A; You, Seng Chan; Ryan, Patrick B; Prieto-Alhambra, Daniel; Rijnbeek, Peter R",,188,17

We sought to identify alterations to established conventional evidence-based management of acute severe ulcerative colitis during the early COVID-19 pandemic, the effect on outcomes, and any associations with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and severe COVID-19 outcomes. METHODS: The PROTECT-ASUC study was a multicentre, observational, case-control study in 60 acute secondary care hospitals throughout the UK. We included adults (&#8805;18 years) with either ulcerative colitis or inflammatory bowel disease unclassified, who presented with acute severe ulcerative colitis and fulfilled the Truelove and Witts criteria. Cases and controls were identified as either admitted or managed in emergency ambulatory care settings between March 1, 2020, and June 30, 2020 (COVID-19 pandemic period cohort), or between Jan 1, 2019, and June 30, 2019 (historical control cohort), respectively. The primary outcome was the proportion of patients with acute severe ulcerative colitis receiving rescue therapy (including primary induction) or colectomy. The study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04411784. FINDINGS: We included 782 patients (398 in the pandemic period cohort and 384 in the historical control cohort) who met the Truelove and Witts criteria for acute severe ulcerative colitis. The proportion of patients receiving rescue therapy (including primary induction) or surgery was higher during the pandemic period than in the historical period (217 [55%] of 393 patients vs 159 [42%] of 380 patients; p=0·00024) and the time to rescue therapy was shorter in the pandemic cohort than in the historical cohort (p=0·0026). This difference was driven by a greater use of rescue and primary induction therapies with biologicals, ciclosporin, or tofacitinib in the COVID-19 pandemic period cohort than in the historical control period cohort (177 [46%] of 387 patients in the COVID-19 cohort vs 134 [36%] of 373 patients in the historical cohort; p=0·0064). During the pandemic, more patients received ambulatory (outpatient) intravenous steroids (51 [13%] of 385 patients vs 19 [5%] of 360 patients; p=0·00023). Fewer patients received thiopurines (29 [7%] of 398 patients vs 46 [12%] of 384; p=0·029) and 5-aminosalicylic acids (67 [17%] of 398 patients vs 98 [26%] of 384; p=0·0037) during the pandemic than in the historical control period. Colectomy rates were similar between the pandemic and historical control groups (64 [16%] of 389 vs 50 [13%] of 375; p=0·26); however, laparoscopic surgery was less frequently performed during the pandemic period (34 [53%] of 64] vs 38 [76%] of 50; p=0·018). Five (2%) of 253 patients tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 during hospital treatment. Two (2%) of 103 patients re-tested for SARS-CoV-2 during the 3-month follow-up were positive 5 days and 12 days, respectively, after discharge from index admission. Both recovered without serious outcomes. INTERPRETATION: The COVID-19 pandemic altered practice patterns of gastroenterologists and colorectal surgeons in the management of acute severe ulcerative colitis but was associated with similar outcomes to a historical cohort. Despite continued use of high-dose corticosteroids and biologicals, the incidence of COVID-19 within 3 months was low and not associated with adverse COVID-19 outcomes.

Here we report the experience of a cardiac surgery unit in a developing country in response to the COVID-19 crisis. METHODS: From 6th April to 12th June 2020, 58 patients underwent urgent or emergency cardiac surgery. Data was reviewed from a prospectively entered unit-maintained cardiac surgery database. To ensure safe delivery of care to patients, a series of strict measures were implemented which included: a parallel healthcare system maintaining a COVID-19 cold site, social isolation of patients for one to 2 weeks before surgery, polymerase chain reaction testing for COVID-19, 72 hours before surgery, discrete staff assigned only to cardiac surgical cases socially isolated for 2 weeks as necessary. RESULTS: The mean age at surgery was 59.7 ± 11 years and 41 (70.7%) were male. Fifty-two patients were hypertensive (90%), and 32 were diabetic (55.2%). There were three emergency type A aortic dissections. Forty-seven patients underwent coronary artery bypass graft surgery with all but three performed off-pump. Fourteen cases required blood product transfusion. One patient had postoperative pneumonia associated with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. The median length of stay was 5.7 ± 1.8 days. All patients were discharged home after rehabilitation. There were no cases of COVID-19 infection among healthcare workers during the study period. CONCLUSION: These strategies allowed us to maintain a service for urgent and emergency procedures and may prove useful for larger countries when there is decrease in COVID-19 cases and planning for the restart of elective cardiac surgery.","Ramsingh, Richard A E; Duval, Jean-Luc; Rahaman, Natasha C; Rampersad, Risshi D; Angelini, Gianni D; Teodori, Giovanni",J. card. surg,188,16

Recently, the role of APN as a receptor for PEDV has been questioned. In our study, the role of APN in PEDV and TGEV infections was studied in primary porcine enterocytes. After seven days of cultivation, 89% of enterocytes presented microvilli and showed a two- to five-fold higher susceptibility to PEDV and TGEV. A significant increase of PEDV and TGEV infection was correlated with a higher expression of APN, which was indicative that APN plays an important role in porcine coronavirus infections. However, PEDV and TGEV infected both APN positive and negative enterocytes. PEDV and TGEV Miller showed a higher infectivity in APN positive cells than in APN negative cells. In contrast, TGEV Purdue replicated better in APN negative cells. These results show that an additional receptor exists, different from APN for porcine coronaviruses. Subsequently, treatment of enterocytes with neuraminidase (NA) had no effect on infection efficiency of TGEV, implying that terminal cellular sialic acids (SAs) are no receptor determinants for TGEV. Treatment of TGEV with NA significantly enhanced the infection which shows that TGEV is masked by SAs.","Cui, Tingting; Theuns, Sebastiaan; Xie, Jiexiong; Van den Broeck, Wim; Nauwynck, Hans J",Viruses,188,31

Apart from angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, neuropilin-1 (NRP1) has been recently found to serve as another host factor for SARS-CoV-2 infection; thus, blocking S1-NRP1 interaction can be a potential treatment for COVID-19. Herein, molecular recognition between SARS-CoV-2 S1 C-end rule (CendR) heptapeptide including small-molecule antagonists (EG00229 and EG01377) and the NRP1 was investigated using molecular dynamics simulations and binding free energy calculations based on MM/PBSA method. The binding affinity and the number of hot-spot residues of EG01377/NRP1 complex were higher than those of CendR and EG00229 systems, in line with the reported experimental data as well as with the lower water accessibility at the ligand-binding site. The (i) T316, P317, and D320 and (ii) S346, T349, and Y353 residues were confirmed to respectively form H-bonds with the positively charged guanidinium group and the negatively charged carboxyl moiety of all studied ligands. Moreover, Rosetta protein design was employed to improve CendR peptide binding affinity to NRP1. The newly designed peptides, especially R683G and A684M, exhibited higher binding efficiency than the native CendR heptapeptide as well as the small-molecule EG00229 by forming more H-bonds and hydrophobic interactions with NPR1, suggesting that these designed peptides could be promising NRP1 inhibitors to combat SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Klaewkla, Methus; Charoenwongpaiboon, Thanapon; Mahalapbutr, Panupong",J Mol Liq,188,20

Data sources: Between April and July 2020, articles were selected using the databases: Virtual Health Library, PubMed and Scientific Electronic Library Online. The following descriptors were used: [(pediatrics) AND (emergencies) AND (diagnostic imaging) AND (medical overuse)] and [(Coronavirus infections) OR (COVID-19) AND (pediatrics) AND (emergencies) AND (diagnostic imaging)]. Inclusion criteria were articles available in full, in Portuguese or English, published from 2016 to 2020 or from 2019 to 2020, and articles that covered the theme. Articles without adherence to the theme and duplicate texts in the databases were excluded. Data synthesis: 61 publications were identified, of which 17 were comprised in this review. Some imaging tests used in pediatric emergency departments increase the possibility of developing future malignancies in patients, since they emit ionizing radiation. There are clinical decision instruments that allow reducing unnecessary exam requests, avoiding over-medicalization, and hospital expenses. Moreover, with the COVID-19 pandemic, there was a growing concern about the overuse of imaging exams in the pediatric population, which highlights the problems pointed out by this review. Conclusions: It is necessary to improve hospital staff training, use clinical decision instruments and develop guidelines to reduce the number of exams required, allowing hospital cost savings; and reducing children's exposure to ionizing agents.","Floriani, Isabela Dombeck; Borgmann, Ariela Victoria; Barreto, Marina Rachid; Ribeiro, Elaine Rossi","Rev.

The virus thereby exploits structural disadvantages, rooted partly in historical and contemporary anti-Black sentiments, working against African Americans. These include higher rates of comorbid illness and more limited health care access, higher rates of disadvantageous labor market positioning and community and housing conditions, greater exposure to long-term care residence, and higher incarceration rates. COVID-19 also exposes African Americans' greater vulnerability to recession, and possibly greater susceptibility to accompanying behavioral health problems. If they are left unaddressed, the very vulnerabilities COVID-19 exploits may perpetuate themselves. However, continuing and supplementing health and economic COVID mitigation policies can disproportionately benefit African Americans and reduce short- and long-term adverse effects. The greater impact of COVID-19 on African Americans demonstrates the consequences of pervasive social and economic inequality and marks this as a critical time to prevent further compounding of adverse effects.","Snowden, Lonnie R; Graaf, Genevieve",J. racial ethnic health disparities (Internet),188,14

METHODS: Self-reported data from a migraine tracking smartphone application, Migraine Buddy, were used. Data were collected from users who reported at least one attack in the Jan, Feb, Mar and Apr of 2018, 2019 and 2020. In addition, a survey was conducted to evaluate the impact of COVID-19 on migraine management. RESULTS: On average, data from 124,717 users per month (mean age 36.3 ± 10.9 years and 89% female) were collected. Overall, the mean frequency of migraine headache was higher in 2020 than in 2019 and higher in 2019 than in 2018. The four commonest headache triggers in 2018, 2019 and 2020 were stress in 39.7, 38.4 and 36.1%, lack of sleep in 25, 25 and 22.8%, neck pain, 20, 20.4 and 19.3 and anxiety in 19, 18.4 and 18.4% of participants, respectively. 1689 users participated in the survey and they reported that they preferred face-to-face (54.29%) to telehealth (11.9%) consultations. CONCLUSION: An increase in migraine frequency from 2018 to 2020 was reported by the users of the mobile phone. This could reflect a real increase or change in reporting habits. Stress, lack of sleep, neck pain and anxiety were the commonest attack triggers. The frequency of these triggers decreased slightly in 2020 compared to 2019 and 2018. An increase in telehealth consultations with specialists was reported in the survey but migraine patients preferred face-to-face consultations.","Haghdoost, Faraidoon; Carcel, Cheryl; Chandrasekhar, Deepak; Rodgers, Anthony; Delcourt, Candice",J. neurol,188,23

The 3C-like protease (3CLpro) of SARS-CoV-2 is a preferred target for broad spectrum anti-coronavirus drug discovery. We studied the anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity of S. baicalensis and its ingredients. We found that the ethanol extract of S. baicalensis and its major component, baicalein, inhibit SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro activity in vitro with IC50's of 8.52 µg/ml and 0.39 µM, respectively. Both of them inhibit the replication of SARS-CoV-2 in Vero cells with EC50's of 0.74 µg/ml and 2.9 µM, respectively. While baicalein is mainly active at the viral post-entry stage, the ethanol extract also inhibits viral entry. We further identified four baicalein analogues from other herbs that inhibit SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro activity at µM concentration. All the active compounds and the S. baicalensis extract also inhibit the SARS-CoV 3CLpro, demonstrating their potential as broad-spectrum anti-coronavirus drugs.","Liu, Hongbo; Ye, Fei; Sun, Qi; Liang, Hao; Li, Chunmei; Li, Siyang; Lu, Roujian; Huang, Baoying; Tan, Wenjie; Lai, Luhua",J Enzyme Inhib Med Chem,188,16

The COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated existing inequities for many populations including people with disabilities, and data is needed to develop inclusive public health response policies. OBJECTIVE: To identify how COVID-19 has uniquely impacted the lives of adults with disabilities. METHODS: 38 participants were recruited through disability advocacy groups and social media. Semi-structured virtual focus groups were conducted with adults (&#8805;18 years) who self-identified as having a disability. Focus groups were conducted for each of six disability sub-groups: vision, hearing, mobility and physical, mental health, cognitive, intellectual, and developmental, and chronic illness. Using inductive coding, major themes were identified and compared across the disability sub-groups. RESULTS: Three major themes and thirteen sub-themes were identified from the focus groups. The three major themes comprised: new problems created by the pandemic, obstacles in daily life that were exacerbated by the pandemic, and broader changes to accessibility and disability identity. Sub-themes such as difficulty with COVID-19 testing and regular medical care were reported by participants of all disability sub-groups, while other sub-themes like direct care needs and medical rationing were reported by participants from a subset of the disability sub-groups. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate how the COVID-19 pandemic unequally impacts disabled people. The participants indicated that to fully address their needs, disability perspectives must be included in the public health pandemic response. As new research shows that COVID-19 can cause long-term disability, the urgency to ensure the disability community is part of public health policies will increase.","Epstein, Sabrina; Campanile, Jessica; Cerilli, Caroline; Gajwani, Prateek; Varadaraj, Varshini; Swenor, Bonnielin K",Disabil Health J,188,18

In Nigeria, as of 21st April 2020, 668 confirmed cases, 22 deaths and 188 recoveries have been reported. Police officers are at the forefront of enforcing advisories to ensure public compliance. However, there is a paucity of data on knowledge, risk perception, and adherence to COVID-19 advisories issued by the Health authorities particularly among the police officers. We, therefore, assessed the knowledge, risk perceptions and adherence to NCDC recommended advisory on COVID-19. Methods: we conducted a two-stage sampling cross-sectional study among different cadres of police officers in Benue State, Nigeria using a pretested, semi-structured, interviewer-administered questionnaire. The results of the study were presented in frequencies and proportions. Chi-square test was used for an association between variables at p-value < 0.05.

This syndrome shares characteristics with Kawasaki disease. CASE REPORT: A 15-year-old girl presented to our Emergency Department (ED) with fevers and malaise. She was diagnosed on her initial visit with an acute viral syndrome and discharged with a COVID polymerase chain reaction test pending, which was subsequently negative. She returned 3 days later with persistent fever, conjunctivitis, and a symmetric targetoid rash over her palms. She had no adenopathy, but her erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein were both significantly elevated at 90 mm/h and 19.61 mg/dL, respectively. The patient was then transferred to the regional children's hospital due to a clinical suspicion for MIS-C, and subsequent COVID-19 immunoglobulin G testing was positive. She had been empirically started on intravenous immunoglobulin in addition to 81 mg aspirin daily. Initial echocardiograms showed mild dilatation of the left main coronary artery, and on repeat echocardiogram, a right coronary artery aneurysm was also identified. Oral prednisone therapy (5 mg) was initiated and the patient was discharged on a continued prednisone taper. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS?: We present a case of a 15-year-old girl who presented to the ED with MIS-C who developed coronary aneurysms despite early therapy, to increase awareness among emergency physicians of this emerging condition.","Nelson, Cole; Ishimine, Paul; Hayden, Stephen R; Correia, Matthew; Wardi, Gabriel",J Emerg Med,188,33

However, since March 2020, it has been most common to see drawn, designed, or interpreted images in three dimensions, sometimes even representing different or directly invented viruses. This analysis studies a sample of images supposedly of SARS-CoV-2 that appeared at the beginning of this pandemic on the internet. Fake images or imaginary illustrations of the Covid-19 coronavirus predominate in all sources of information examined, except for those documented in encyclopedias or scientific articles. Rather than real images, the media have used more fake images of the coronavirus, often from repositories or paid stocks, usually freely available. When presenting SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus content, the use of fake, unrealistic, esthetically retouched illustrations is more common than actual or scientific photographs of the virus. The reference image used in the media and other information sources of the coronavirus that causes Covid-19 is a retouched three-dimensional, color design image for illustration rather than an actual image. The original, real images of the coronavirus did not have the expected informative presence in an emergency situation. The use of unrealistic images of the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus seems to be a manifestation of a low-intensity infodemic. However, information professionals must use rigorous images to support their information, also in the case of the Covid-19.","Andreu-Sánchez, Celia; Martín-Pascual, Miguel-Ángel",Prof. Inf.,188,15

Computerized tomography (CT) is one of the most effective tools for COVID-19 screening. Since some specific patterns such as bilateral, peripheral, and basal predominant ground-glass opacity, multifocal patchy consolidation, crazy-paving pattern with a peripheral distribution can be observed in CT images and these patterns have been declared as the findings of COVID-19 infection. For patient monitoring, diagnosis and segmentation of COVID-19, which spreads into the lung, expeditiously and accurately from CT, will provide vital information about the stage of the disease. In this work, we proposed a SegNet-based network using the attention gate (AG) mechanism for the automatic segmentation of COVID-19 regions in CT images. AGs can be easily integrated into standard convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures with a minimum computing load as well as increasing model precision and predictive accuracy. Besides, the success of the proposed network has been evaluated based on dice, Tversky, and focal Tversky loss functions to deal with low sensitivity arising from the small lesions. The experiments were carried out using a fivefold cross-validation technique on a COVID-19 CT segmentation database containing 473 CT images. The obtained sensitivity, specificity, and dice scores were reported as 92.73%, 99.51%, and 89.61%, respectively. The superiority of the proposed method has been highlighted by comparing with the results reported in previous studies and it is thought that it will be an auxiliary tool that accurately detects automatic COVID-19 regions from CT images.","Budak, Ümit; Çibuk, Musa; Cömert, Zafer; Sengür, Abdulkadir",J. digit. imaging,188,24

Recently, we had a critically ill COVID-19 patient who developed severe AKI and needed continuous RRT (CRRT). To avoid the potential risk of infection from CRRT effluents, we measured severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) genetic material in the effluents by qRT-PCR, and low copy numbers of the viral genome were detected. Due to unstable hemodynamic status in critically ill patients, CRRT should be the first choice for severe AKI in COVID-19 patients.

We aimed to study the impact of COVID-19 on respondents with self-reported IBS. METHODOLOGY: We conducted an anonymised survey from May to June 2020 in 33 countries. Knowledge, attitudes and practices on personal hygiene and social distancing as well as psychological impact of COVID-19 were assessed. Statistical analysis was performed to determine differences in well-being and compliance to social distancing measures between respondents with and without self-reported IBS. Factors associated with improvement or worsening of IBS symptoms were evaluated. RESULTS: Out of 2704 respondents, 2024 (74.9%) did not have IBS, 305 (11.3%) with self-reported IBS and 374 (13.8%) did not know what IBS was. Self-reported IBS respondents reported significantly worse emotional, social and psychological well-being compared to non-IBS respondents and were less compliant to social distancing measures (28.2% vs 35.3%, p=0.029). 61.6% reported no change, 26.6% reported improvement and 11.8% reported worsening IBS symptoms. Higher proportion of respondents with no change in IBS symptoms were willing to practise social distancing indefinitely versus those who deteriorated (74.9% vs 51.4%, p=0.016). In multivariate analysis, willingness to continue social distancing for another 2-3 weeks (versus longer period) was significantly associated with higher odds of worsening IBS. CONCLUSION: Our study showed self-reported IBS respondents had worse well-being and compliance to social distancing measures than non-IBS respondents.

SARS-CoV-2 was detected in mucosal samples, including rectal swabs, as late as 15 days after exposure. Marked inflammation and coagulopathy in blood and tissues were prominent features. Transcriptome analysis demonstrated stimulation of interferon and interleukin-6 pathways in bronchoalveolar lavage samples and repression of natural killer cell- and T cell-associated transcripts in peripheral blood.

The ability of COVID-19 to cause chronic illness, sarcopenia, and physical deconditioning may be underestimated and go beyond the anticipated respiratory sequelae. Myalgia, lethargy, and anorexia are common symptoms even in mild to moderate cases and have the potential to exacerbate frailty. How this impacts on risk-stratification for patients requiring surgery for time-critical conditions, such as malignancy, requires further urgent investigation. MAIN BODY: The deleterious effect of sarcopenia and poor physical capacity are well recognised in cancer surgery. This review commentary highlights current evidence which suggests skeletal muscle as an under recognised cause of COVID-19-related functional deconditioning. The mechanisms behind this are via direct (viral induced myositis, nutritional decline, cytokine-mediated myopathy) and indirect mechanisms (social isolation, inactivity, and psychological consequences). CONCLUSION: Further mechanistic research is required to explore the processes behind the deconditioning effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection and how this impacts on treatment of malignant disease.","Casey, Patrick; Ang, Yeng; Sultan, Javed",World J Surg Oncol,188,1

This study aims to examine changes in levels of COVID-19 concern and safety behaviours among persons living in Croatia during the period in which the first COVID-19 case was identified and when the country recorded its first fatality. These changes were examined with respect to gender and family circumstances. DESIGN: The repeated cross-sectional data were conducted over two time points over the 3 weeks (N1 = 888; N2 = 966). METHODS: Participants completed online questionnaire regarding various COVID-19 concerns and safety behaviours aimed at disease prevention. RESULTS: Findings demonstrate dramatic increase in concern and safety behaviours among participants during the 3 weeks between the first identified case and the first fatality. The results suggest that parents, and mothers especially, represent the most concerned group, regardless of age. People with chronic health conditions also expressed greater concern and safety behaviour than healthy participants, but with small effect size. CONCLUSION: These findings highlight the importance of developing clear guidelines for alleviating the negative effects on mental health through effective communication strategies that minimize fear and emphasize positive behavioural change. Statement of contribution What is already known on this subject? In times of pandemic, people react with elevated levels of anxiety and some will adjust their behaviours in order to protect themselves as well as their family and friends. Some of the measures introduced to protect the spread of the COVID-19 disease have induced an atmosphere of fear, which in turn can lead to an increase in maladaptive anxiety and a greater burden on mental health. What does this study add? By conducting the research in two waves representing two critical time points in the developing COVID-19 situation in Croatia, we were able to trace a large increase in anxiety levels and safety behaviours among the general population. There is a discordance between those who are at most risk from serious consequences of the disease and those who are at greatest risk for maladaptive anxiety. Parents, and mothers in particular, represent the most concerned group, regardless of age. Lockdown measures have allowed us to ensure the safety of those vulnerable for serious COVID-19 illness. Now, we must focus on preserving the mental health of our whole community.","Lauri Korajlija, Anita; Jokic-Begic, Natasa",Br. j. health psychol,188,26

In this study, we analyzed (i) threats to rhinoceros conservation including external shocks, (ii) historical rhinoceros conservation strategies in Zimbabwe and Africa, more broadly, and (iii) opportunities for enhanced rhinoceros conservation in Zimbabwe and Africa. A literature search from 1975 to 2020 was carried out using a predefined search protocol, involving a number of filters based on a set of keywords to balance search sensitivity with specificity. A total of 193 articles, which were most relevant to key themes on rhinoceros conservation, were used in this study. The common threats to rhinoceros conservation identified in this paper include poaching, habitat fragmentation and loss, international trade in illegal rhino products, and external shocks such as global financial recessions and pandemics. Cascading effects emanating from these threats include small and isolated populations, which are prone to genetic, demographic, and environmental uncertainties. Rhinoceros conservation strategies being implemented include education and awareness campaigns, better equipped and more antipoaching efforts, use of innovative systems and technologies, dehorning, and enhancing safety nets, and livelihoods of local communities. Opportunities for rhinoceros conservation vary across the spatial scale, and these include (a) a well-coordinated stakeholder and community involvement, (b) strategic meta-population management, (c) enhancing law enforcement initiatives through incorporating real-time surveillance technologies and intruder detection sensor networks for crime detection, (d) scaling up demand reduction awareness campaigns, and (e) developing more certified wildlife crime and forensic laboratories, and information repository for international corporation. © 2021 The Authors.

Pursuing serious conversations about antimicrobial resistance [version 1;peer review: awaiting peer review],14.451072,5.734361,2020,"The lockdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic has led to various sudden changes in a large number of individuals. In response, the question of how individuals from different social and economic strata cope with those changes has arisen, as well as how much they have affected their mental well-being. Choosing strategies that cope with both the pandemic and the well-being of the population has also been a challenge for different governments. While a large number of studies have investigated the mental health of people from different populations during the COVID-19 pandemic, few have explored the number and type of changes experienced during lockdown by the general population, alongside their relationships with health-related quality of life (HRQoL). To fill this research gap, an observational cross-sectional study on those associations was conducted in the French-speaking part of the Swiss general population. Data were collected from 431 participants during the first four weeks of lockdown due to COVID-19. Multivariate regressions were used to identify the sociodemographic profile of the population that experienced different types and numbers of changes during this period, the association of those changes with the HRQoL-mental and physical-and infection beliefs, and the perception of the governmental measures. We show that the more changes people experienced, the lower their mental HRQoL; however, adherence to governmental measures has helped people to cope with the imposed changes, even though the number of unexpected and unwished changes have strained their mental HRQoL. The low-income population experienced financial difficulties and changes in their food intake more frequently, while dual-citizenship or non-Swiss individuals declared conflictual situations more frequently. Sport practice had a positive association with mental HRQoL; nevertheless, a decrease in sport practice was frequently reported, which correlated with a lower mental HRQoL. Risk perception of COVID-19 increased with lower physical HRQoL score, which supports the efficiency of governmental communication regarding the pandemic. Our results support that government measures should be accompanied by effective and targeted communication about the risk of infection, in order to encourage all strata of the general population to follow such measures and adapt to the changes without unduly affecting their mental health. The usage of such tools might help to reduce the impact of policy-imposed changes on the mental HRQoL of the general population, by inducing voluntary changes in informed and engaged populations.","Duay, Manon; Morgiève, Margot; Niculita-Hirzel, Hélène",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),188,1

Spatial epidemiology, which often uses the inherently identifiable variable of participant address, must balance reproducibility with participant privacy. In this study, we assess the impact of several different data perturbation methods on key spatial statistics and patient privacy. METHODS: We analyzed the impact of perturbation on spatial patterns in the full set of address-level mortality data from Lawrence, MA during the period from 1911 to 1913. The original death locations were perturbed using seven different published approaches to stochastic and deterministic spatial data anonymization. Key spatial descriptive statistics were calculated for each perturbation, including changes in spatial pattern center, Global Moran's I, Local Moran's I, distance to the k-th nearest neighbors, and the L-function (a normalized form of Ripley's K). A spatially adapted form of k-anonymity was used to measure the privacy protection conferred by each method, and its compliance with HIPAA and GDPR privacy standards. RESULTS: Random perturbation at 50 m, donut masking between 5 and 50 m, and Voronoi masking maintain the validity of descriptive spatial statistics better than other perturbations. Grid center masking with both 100 × 100 and 250 × 250 m cells led to large changes in descriptive spatial statistics. None of the perturbation methods adhered to the HIPAA standard that all points have a k-anonymity > 10. All other perturbation methods employed had at least 265 points, or over 6%, not adhering to the HIPAA standard. CONCLUSIONS: Using the set of published perturbation methods applied in this analysis, HIPAA and GDPR compliant de-identification was not compatible with maintaining key spatial patterns as measured by our chosen summary statistics. Further research should investigate alternate methods to balancing tradeoffs between spatial data privacy and preservation of key patterns in public health data that are of scientific and medical importance.","Broen, Kelly; Trangucci, Rob; Zelner, Jon",Int J Health Geogr,188,16

Disparity in the infection of SARS-CoV2 among host population and species is an established fact without any clear explanation. To initiate infection, viral S-protein binds to the Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor of the host cell. Our analysis of retrieved amino acid sequences deposited in data bases shows that S-proteins and ACE2 are rich in cysteine (Cys) residues, many of which are conserved in various SARS-related coronaviruses and participate in intra-molecular disulfide bonds. High-resolution protein structures of S-proteins and ACE2 receptors highlighted the probability that two of these disulfide bonds are potentially redox-active, facilitating the primal interaction between the receptor and the spike protein. Presence of redox-active disulfides in the interacting parts of S-protein, ACE2, and a ferredoxin-like fold domain in ACE2, strongly indicate the role of redox in COVID-19 pathogenesis and severity. Resistant animals lack a redox-active disulfide (Cys133-Cys141) in ACE2 sequences, further strengthening the redox hypothesis for infectivity. ACE2 is a known regulator of oxidative stress. Augmentation of cellular oxidation with aging and illness is the most likely explanation of increased vulnerability of the elderly and persons with underlying health conditions to COVID-19.","Singh, Jaswinder; Dhindsa, Rajinder S; Misra, Vikram; Singh, Baljit",Comput Struct Biotechnol J,188,16

This was a single-center observational study, recruiting all consecutive adults with COVID-19. The elevation of aspartate aminotransferase (AST) or alanine aminotransferase (ALT) to the highest level between COVID-19 diagnosis and hospital discharge was categorized according to a standardized toxicity grade scale. In total, 799 patients were included in this study, 39% of which were female, with a mean age of 69.9 (±16.0) years. Of these patients, 225 (28.1%) developed LEE of grade &#8805;2 after a median of three days (interquartile range (IQR): 0-8 days) from the diagnosis of COVID-19, and they were estimated to have a higher hazard of death or ICU admission (adjusted hazard ratio (aHR): 1.46, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.14-1.88). The clinical and laboratory variables associated with the development of LEE were male sex, higher respiratory rate, higher gamma glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT) and lower albumin levels at baseline. Among the analyzed treatments, steroids, tocilizumab and darunavir/ritonavir correlated with LEE. In conclusion, LEE were associated with mortality and ICU admission among COVID-19 patients. While the origin of LEE is probably multifactorial, LEE evaluation could add information to the clinical and laboratory variables that are commonly evaluated during the course of COVID-19.","Taramasso, Lucia; Vena, Antonio; Bovis, Francesca; Portunato, Federica; Mora, Sara; Dentone, Chiara; Delfino, Emanuele; Mikulska, Malgorzata; Giacobbe, Daniele Roberto; De Maria, Andrea; Magnasco, Laura; Giacomini, Mauro; Di Biagio, Antonio; Bassetti, Matteo",,188,1

We aimed at evaluating if 2-deoxy-2-[18F]fluoro-D-glucose ([18F]FDG) was able to demonstrate a persistent inflammatory process. METHODS: Recovered adult COVID-19 patients, who complained unexplained persisting symptoms for more than 30 days during the follow-up visits, were invited to participate in the study. Patients fulfilling inclusion criteria were imaged by [18F]FDG positron emission tomography/computed tomography ([18F]FDG-PET/CT). Whole-body [18F]FDG-PET/CT, performed according to good clinical practice, was qualitatively (comparison with background/liver) and semi-quantitatively (target-to-blood pool ratio calculated as average SUVmax artery/average SUVmean inferior vena cava) analyzed. Negative follow-up [18F]FDG-PET/CT images of oncologic patients matched for age/sex served as controls. Mann-Whitney test was used to test differences between groups. SPSS version 26 was used for analyses. RESULTS: Ten recovered SARS-CoV-2 patients (seven male and three females, median age 52 years, range 46-80) with persisting symptoms were enrolled in the study. Common findings at visual analysis were increased [18F]FDG uptake in bone marrow and blood vessels (8/10 and 6/10 cases, respectively). [18F]FDG uptake in bone marrow did not differ between cases and controls (p = 0.16). The total vascular score was similar in the two groups (p = 0.95). The target-to-blood pool ratio resulted higher in recovered SARS-CoV-2 patients than in controls. CONCLUSION: Although the total vascular score was similar in the two groups, the target-to-blood pool ratio was significantly higher in three vascular regions (thoracic aorta, right iliac artery, and femoral arteries) in the recovered COVID-19 cohort than in controls, suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 induces vascular inflammation, which may be responsible for persisting symptoms.","Sollini, Martina; Ciccarelli, Michele; Cecconi, Maurizio; Aghemo, Alessio; Morelli, Paola; Gelardi, Fabrizia; Chiti, Arturo",Eur. j. nucl. med. mol. imaging,188,16

This study carried out a dynamic follow-up survey of the psychological state of Chinese people and their evaluation of Wuhan residents during the epidemic period since the day of Wuhan’s citywide lockdown. The purpose of this work was to explore differences in degree of concern, risk perception, and anxiety response among regions affected by COVID-19 to different degrees. Our findings have important practical value for future crisis emergency management. This work included a large-scale survey covering 4833 Chinese residents, and it was conducted after Wuhan was closed. Its purpose was to assess whether COVID-19 invoked the psychological typhoon eye effect of a disaster event. The survey involved two angles, the “actor” angle, in which participants evaluated their own psychological states, and the “bystander” angle, in which participants evaluated other Wuhan citizens’ psychological states. We called these Study 1 and Study 2. Study1 explored the psychological state of residents themselves and the results were consistent with the ripple effect to some extent within the epidemic period, which is the opposite pattern of the psychological typhoon eye. The residents who lived near the hardest-hit areas showed significantly higher risk perception and anxiety. Study 2 explored how people from different areas evaluated Wuhan residents’ psychological state. The results of Study 2 did show a replicated psychological typhoon eye effect in terms of anxiety, and number of psychological workers and doctors residents needed. However, when it came to risk cognition, residents in low-risk areas rated Wuhan citizens’ risk cognition as significantly lower than people in high-risk areas did, which generally manifested as a ripple effect. This study also showed a marginal zone effect and a psychological controllable threshold. The concave effect means there was a phenomenon in which risk perception was lower in the middle zone or middle-risk area than at either end. The psychological controllable threshold is one of the sub-scales of risk cognition. That is, uncontrollability did not show the psychological typhoon eye effect in the bystander portion of our study. This paper further expands and enriches the boundary conditions of the psychological typhoon eye effect of public risk events, provides more abundant and direct research evidence for the perception difference between actor and bystander angle in the study of psychological typhoon eye effect, and has important implications for a deeper understanding of the psychological evolution of public health emergencies and public crisis management.","Wen, Fangfang; Ma, Shuhan; Ye, Hanxue; Qi, Yue; Zuo, Bin",Acta Psych.

Corticosteroids could attenuate this inappropriate response, although there are still some concerns regarding its use, timing, and dose. METHODS: This is a nationwide, prospective, multicenter, observational, cohort study in critically ill adult patients with COVID-19 admitted into Intensive Care Units (ICU) in Spain from 12th March to 29th June 2020. Using a multivariable Cox model with inverse probability weighting, we compared relevant outcomes between patients treated with early corticosteroids (before or within the first 48 h of ICU admission) with those who did not receive early corticosteroids (delayed group) or any corticosteroids at all (never group). Primary endpoint was ICU mortality. Secondary endpoints included 7-day mortality, ventilator-free days, and complications. RESULTS: A total of 691 patients out of 882 (78.3%) received corticosteroid during their hospital stay. Patients treated with early-corticosteroids (n = 485) had lower ICU mortality (30.3% vs. never 36.6% and delayed 44.2%) and lower 7-day mortality (7.2% vs. never 15.2%) compared to non-early treated patients. They also had higher number of ventilator-free days, less length of ICU stay, and less secondary infections than delayed treated patients. There were no differences in medical complications between groups. Of note, early use of moderate-to-high doses was associated with better outcomes than low dose regimens. CONCLUSION: Early use of corticosteroids in critically ill patients with COVID-19 is associated with lower mortality than no or delayed use, and fewer complications than delayed use.","Monedero, Pablo; Gea, Alfredo; Castro, Pedro; Candela-Toha, Angel M; Hernández-Sanz, María L; Arruti, Egoitz; Villar, Jesús; Ferrando, Carlos",Crit Care,188,24

When the disease progression is long such as for HIV, individuals often experience switches among different states. We derive an epidemic model in which infected individuals have a discrete set of states of infectivity and can switch among different states. The model also incorporates a general incidence form in which new infections are distributed among different disease states. We discuss the importance of the transmission-transfer network for infectious diseases. Under the assumption that the tranmission-transfer network is strongly connected, we establish that the basic reproduction number R 0 is a sharp threshold parameter: if R 0 &#8804; 1 , the disease-free equilibrium is globally asymptotically stable and the disease always dies out; if R 0 > 1 , the disease-free equilibrium is unstable, the system is uniformly persistent and initial outbreaks lead to persistent disease infection. For a restricted class of incidence functions, we prove that there is a unique endemic equilibrium and it is globally asymptotically stable when R 0 > 1 . Furthermore, we discuss the impact of different state structures on R 0 , on the distribution of the disease states at the unique endemic equilibrium, and on disease control and preventions. Implications to the COVID-19 pandemic are also discussed.","Liu, Suli; Li, Michael Y",Physica D,188,6

However, to date there has been no national study of medication dispensing errors in Jordan. Objective The study aimed to investigate the incidence, nature, severity, causes and predictors of medication dispensing errors. Setting The study was conducted in randomly selected community pharmacies across Jordan. Method A mixed method approach was taken, incorporating prospective disguised observation of dispensing errors and interviews with pharmacists regarding the causes of errors. A multidisciplinary committee evaluated the severity of errors. Proportionate random sampling was used to include 350 pharmacies from across all regions of Jordan. SPSS (Version 24) was used for data analysis. Main outcome measure Incidence, nature, severity, causes and predictors of medication dispensing errors. Results The overall rate of medication dispensing errors was 24.6% (n = 37,009/150,442), of which 11.5% (n = 17,352/150,442) were prescription related errors and 13.1% (n = 19,657/150,442) pharmacist counselling errors. The most common type of prescription-related errors were wrong quantity (37.9%, n = 6584/17,352), whereas the most common pharmacist counselling error was wrong drug (41.9%, n = 8241/19,657). The majority of errors were caused by poor handwriting (30.7%, n = 75,651/37,009), followed by high workload (17.3%, n = 22,964/37,009). More than half of errors (52.6%) were moderate in severity, followed by minor errors (38.8%), and 8.6% of errors were rated as serious. Predictors of medication dispensing errors were: Sundays (OR 2.7; 95% CI 2.15-3.94; p = 0.02), grade A pharmacies (dispensing &#8805; 60 prescriptions a day (OR 3.6; 95% CI 2.89-4.78; p = 0.04)), and prescriptions containing &#8805; 4 medication orders (OR 4.1; 95% CI 2.9-6.4; p = 0.001). Conclusion Medication dispensing errors are common in Jordan and our findings can be generalised and considered as a reference to launch training programmes on safe medication dispensing and independent prescribing for pharmacists.","Abdel-Qader, Derar H; Al Meslamani, Ahmad Z; Lewis, Penny J; Hamadi, Salim",Int. j. clin. pharm,188,16

There is therefore the need to identify those patients with COVID-19 who are at highest risk of developing incident AF. We therefore investigated incident AF risks in a large prospective population of elderly patients with/without incident COVID-19 cases and baseline cardiovascular/non-cardiovascular multi-morbidities. We used two approaches: main effect modeling and secondly, a machine-learning (ML) approach, accounting for the complex dynamic relationships among comorbidity variables. METHODS: We studied a prospective elderly US cohort of 280,592 patients from medical databases in an 8-month investigation of with/without newly incident COVID19 cases. Incident AF outcomes were examined in relationship to diverse multi-morbid conditions, COVID-19 status and demographic variables, with ML accounting for the dynamic nature of changing multimorbidity risk factors. RESULTS: Multi-morbidity contributed to the onset of confirmed COVID-19 cases with cognitive impairment (OR 1.69; 95%CI 1.52-1.88), anemia (OR 1.41; 95%CI 1.32-1.50), diabetes mellitus (OR 1.35; 95%CI 1.27-1.44) and vascular disease (OR 1.30; 95%CI 1.21-1.39) having the highest associations. A main effect model (C-index value 0.718) showed that COVID-19 had the highest association with incident AF cases (OR 3.12; 95%CI 2.61-3.710, followed by congestive heart failure (1.72; 95%CI 1.50-1.96), then coronary artery disease (OR 1.43; 95%CI 1.27-1.60) and valvular disease (1.42; 95%CI 1.26-1.60). The ML algorithm demonstrated improved discriminatory validity incrementally over the statistical main effect model (training: C-index 0.729, 95%CI 0.718-0.740; validation: C-index 0.704, 95%CI 0.687-0.72). Calibration of the ML based formulation was satisfactory and better than the main-effect model. Decision curve analysis demonstrated that the clinical utility for the ML based formulation was better than the 'treat all' strategy and the main effect model. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 status has major implications for incident AF in a cohort with diverse cardiovascular/non-cardiovascular multi-morbidities. Our ML approach accounting for dynamic multimorbidity changes had good prediction for new onset AF amongst incident COVID19 cases.","Lip, Gregory Y H; Genaidy, Ash; Tran, George; Marroquin, Patricia; Estes, Cara",Eur. j. intern. med,188,32

In Java, non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) were implemented throughout 2020. However, as a vaccination campaign launches, cases and deaths are rising across the island. METHODS: We used modelling to explore the extent to which data on burials in Jakarta using strict COVID-19 protocols (C19P) provide additional insight into the transmissibility of the disease, epidemic trajectory, and the impact of NPIs. We assess how implementation of NPIs in early 2021 will shape the epidemic during the period of likely vaccine rollout. RESULTS: C19P burial data in Jakarta suggest a death toll approximately 3.3 times higher than reported. Transmission estimates using these data suggest earlier, larger, and more sustained impact of NPIs. Measures to reduce sub-national spread, particularly during Ramadan, substantially mitigated spread to more vulnerable rural areas. Given current trajectory, daily cases and deaths are likely to increase in most regions as the vaccine is rolled out. Transmission may peak in early 2021 in Jakarta if current levels of control are maintained. However, relaxation of control measures is likely to lead to a subsequent resurgence in the absence of an effective vaccination campaign. CONCLUSIONS: Syndromic measures of mortality provide a more complete picture of COVID-19 severity upon which to base decision-making. The high potential impact of the vaccine in Java is attributable to reductions in transmission to date and dependent on these being maintained. Increases in control in the relatively short-term will likely yield large, synergistic increases in vaccine impact.","Djaafara, Bimandra A; Whittaker, Charles; Watson, Oliver J; Verity, Robert; Brazeau, Nicholas F; Oktavia, Dwi; Adrian, Verry; Salama, Ngabila; Bhatia, Sangeeta; Nouvellet, Pierre; Sherrard-Smith, Ellie; Churcher, Thomas S; Surendra, Henry; Lina, Rosa N; Ekawati, Lenny L; Lestari, Karina D; Andrianto, Adhi; Thwaites, Guy; Baird, J Kevin; Ghani, Azra C; Elyazar, Iqbal R F; Walker, Patrick G T",BMC Med,188,1

METHODS: One hundred fifty-six laboratories confirmed SARS-CoV-2 positive patients were followed up between 1 July and 31 December 2020 and analysed retrospectively. Continuous variables were compared with the independent samples t-test. Categorical variables were compared using the Pearson's chi-square or Fisher's exact test. A P value of less than .05 was considered statistically significant. RESULTS: The age range of the cohort was from 40 to 78 and 73 (46.8%) of 156 patients were male. There was no significant difference in age and gender distribution between 20 patients (12.8%) with SARS-CoV-2/HBV coinfection and 136 patients without HBV infection (87.2%) (P > .05). Liver function tests were higher in the SARS-CoV-2/HBV coinfected patient group but were not statistically significant. The levels of creatine kinase (CK) were significantly higher in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients without HBV infection compared with the SARS-CoV-2/HBV coinfected patient group (P = .0047). Severe/critical illness was less common in the SARS-CoV-2/HBV coinfected patient group, and no deaths were observed. CONCLUSIONS: SARS-CoV-2/HBV coinfection did not change the severity and outcome of COVID-19.

Children with conduct problems have difficulty with rule adherence, and linking early conduct problems with later adherence to COVID-19 guidelines can provide new insight into public health. The current study employed a sample (N = 744) designed to examine the longitudinal consequences of childhood conduct problems (Mean age at study entry = 8.39). The first objective was to link early conduct problems with later adherence to both general and specific COVID-19 guidelines during emerging adulthood (M age = 19.07). The second objective was to prospectively examine how interactional (i.e., callous unemotional traits, impulsivity) and cumulative (i.e., educational attainment, work status, substance use) continuity factors mediated this association. The third objective was to examine differences in sex assigned at birth in these models. Direct associations were observed between childhood conduct problems and lower general, but not specific COVID-19 guideline adherence. Conduct problems were indirectly associated with both general and specific adherence via higher levels of callous unemotional traits, and with specific adherence via higher problematic substance use. No differences in the models were observed across sex assigned at birth. Findings provide insight into both how developmental psychopathology constructs are useful for understanding COVID-19 guideline adherence, and the ways in which conduct problems may shape health outcomes.","Martin-Storey, Alexa; Temcheff, Caroline; Déry, Michèle; Lapalme, Mélanie; Tomasiello, Melina; Mariamo, Audrey; Lemelin, Jean-Pascal",,188,16

Currently, no specific drug combination has consistently demonstrated an association with mortality. The aim of this study was to assess the pattern of associations observed between the different in-hospital treatments administered to a series of 238 patients admitted for COVID-19 and their relationship with mortality. Methods: The electronic medical records of patients that discharged or died from COVID-19 in the Hospital Universitario San Cecilio (Granada, Spain) between March 16 and April 10, 2020 were analysed. From these records, information was obtained on sex, age, comorbidities at admission, clinical information, analytical parameters, imaging tests and empirical treatments used. The outcome variable was the in-hospital mortality. To estimate the associations between the different therapeutic alternatives and the risk of mortality, Hazard Ratios adjusted for age, sex, previous pathologies and severity at discharge were estimated using Cox Regression models. Results: The most frequently used combination of drugs was low molecular weight heparins, hydroxychloroquine, and ritonavir/lopinavir. None of the analysed treatments showed independent association with mortality. The drugs that showed a greater inverse association with mortality were tocilizumab and corticoids. Conclusions: The observed association patterns are consistent with previous literature. It seems necessary to design randomized controlled clinical trials that evaluate the possible protector effect of tocilizumab and corticoids in the risk of mortality for some subgroups of COVID-19 hospitalized patients.","Rivera-Izquierdo, Mario; Valero-Ubierna, María Del Carmen; R-delAmo, Juan Luis; Fernández-García, Miguel Ángel; Martínez-Diz, Silvia; Tahery-Mahmoud, Arezu; Rodríguez-Camacho, Marta; Gámiz-Molina, Ana Belén; Barba-Gyengo, Nicolás; Gámez-Baeza, Pablo; Cabrero-Rodríguez, Celia; Guirado-Ruiz, Pedro Antonio; Martín-Romero, Divina Tatiana; Láinez-Ramos-Bossini, Antonio Jesús; Sánchez-Pérez, María Rosa; Mancera-Romero, José; García-Martín, Miguel; Martín-delosReyes, Luis Miguel; Martínez-Ruiz, Virginia; Jiménez-Mejías, Eladio",Med Clin (Engl Ed),188,1

Mild-to-moderate COVID-19 symptoms include coughing, fever, myalgia, shortness of breath, and acute inflammatory lung injury (ALI). In contrast, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and respiratory failure occur in patients diagnosed with severe COVID-19. ARDS is mediated, at least in part, by a dysregulated inflammatory response due to excessive levels of circulating cytokines, a condition known as the ""cytokine-storm syndrome."" Currently, there are FDA-approved therapies that attenuate the dysregulated inflammation that occurs in COVID-19 patients, such as dexamethasone or other corticosteroids and IL-6 inhibitors, including sarilumab, tocilizumab, and siltuximab. However, the efficacy of these treatments have been shown to be inconsistent. Compounds that activate the vagus nerve-mediated cholinergic anti-inflammatory reflex, such as the &#945;7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor agonist, GTS-21, attenuate ARDS/inflammatory lung injury by decreasing the extracellular levels of high mobility group box-1 (HMGB1) in the airways and the circulation. It is possible that HMGB1 may be an important mediator of the ""cytokine-storm syndrome."" Notably, high plasma levels of HMGB1 have been reported in patients diagnosed with severe COVID-19, and there is a significant negative correlation between HMGB1 plasma levels and clinical outcomes. Nicotine can activate the cholinergic anti-inflammatory reflex, which attenuates the up-regulation and the excessive release of pro-inflammatory cytokines/chemokines. Therefore, we hypothesize that low molecular weight compounds that activate the cholinergic anti-inflammatory reflex, such as nicotine or GTS-21, may represent a potential therapeutic approach to attenuate the dysregulated inflammatory responses in patients with severe COVID-19.","Gauthier, Alex G; Lin, Mosi; Wu, Jiaqi; Kennedy, Thomas P; Daley, Lee-Anne; Ashby, Charles R; Mantell, Lin L",J Immunotoxicol,188,1

Antiviral treatment with convalescent plasma (CP) could be an alternative treatment option. In this case report, we present two kidney transplant recipients and two hemodialysis patients who were infected with SARS-CoV-2 and received CP. Antibodies against the receptor-binding domain in the S1 subunit of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein were determined sequentially by immunoglobulin G (IgG) enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and neutralization assay and specific cellular responses by interferon-gamma ELISpot. Before treatment, in both kidney transplant recipients and one hemodialysis patient antibodies were undetectable by ELISA (ratio < 1.1), corresponding to low neutralizing antibody titers (&#8804;1:40). ELISpot responses in the four patients were either weak or absent. After CP treatment, we observed an increase of SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies (IgG ratio and neutralization titer) and of specific cellular responses. After intermittent clinical improvement, one kidney transplant recipient again developed typical symptoms on Day 12 after treatment and received a second cycle of CP treatment. Altogether, three patients clinically improved and could be discharged from the hospital. However, one 83-year-old multimorbid patient deceased.

BACKGROUND: Given the high incidence of coronavirus and shortage of nurses in Iranian hospitals, learning about nurses' intention to care for patients with COVID-19 is important. DESIGN: In this cross-sectional study, 648 Iranian nurses were surveyed during March 2020. The online questionnaire consisted of two parts. The mediating role was explored for the following: job satisfaction and commitment in the association of workload, quality of supervisor, extra-role behaviours, and pay satisfaction with the intention to care. The study adhered to STROBE checklist for cross-sectional studies. RESULTS: The results of this study show that job satisfaction and organisational commitment mediated the relationship of nurses' workload, quality of supervisor, extra-role behaviours, and pay satisfaction with the intention to care for patients with COVID-19. CONCLUSION: The results of the study indicate the importance of job satisfaction and organisational commitment as mechanisms that help to understand the association of nurses' workload, quality of supervisor, extra-role behaviours and pay satisfaction with the intention to care during the COVID-19 pandemic.

The key component of VV-ECMO is the double-lumen cannula (DLC) that enables single-site access. The biofluid dynamics of this compact device is particularly challenging for neonatal patients due to high Reynolds numbers, tricuspid valve location and right-atrium hemodynamics. In this paper we present detailed findings of our comparative analysis of the right-atrial hemodynamics and salient design features of the 13Fr Avalon Elite DLC (as the clinically preferred neonatal cannula) with the alternate Origen DLC design, using experimentally validated computational fluid dynamics. Highly accurate 3D-reconstructions of both devices were obtained through an integrated optical coherence tomography and micro-CT imaging approach. Both cannula configurations displayed complex flow structures inside the atrium, superimposed over predominant recirculation regimes. We found that the Avalon DLC performed significantly better than the Origen alternative, by capturing 80% and 94% of venous blood from the inferior and superior vena cavae, respectively and infusing the oxygenated blood with an efficiency of more than 85%. The micro-scale geometric design features of the Avalon DLC that are associated with superior hemodynamics were investigated through 14 parametric cannula configurations. These simulations showed that the strategic placement of drainage holes, the smooth infusion blood stream diverter and efficient distribution of the venous blood capturing area between the vena cavae are associated with robust blood flow performance. Nevertheless, our parametric results indicate that there is still room for further device optimization beyond the performance measurements for both Avalon and Origen DLC in this study. In particular, the performance envelope of malpositioned cannula and off-design conditions require additional blood flow simulations for analysis.","Rasooli, Reza; Jamil, Muhammad; Rezaeimoghaddam, Mohammad; Yildiz, Yahya; Salihoglu, Ece; Pekkan, Kerem",J Biomech,188,1

STUDY DESIGN: Case-control study. METHODS: One hundred fifty-one consecutive patients diagnosed with PVOD were enrolled, and samples from 38 patients who visited the doctor within 3 months of symptom onset were collected and analyzed. Thirty-two individuals who underwent surgery for nasal septal deviation during the same time period were collected as the control group. The Sniffin' Sticks psychophysical olfactory test was used to evaluate olfactory function. Olfactory cleft specimens were collected using nasopharyngeal flocked swabs (COPAN FLOQSwabs). Eighteen viruses were tested for with the Luminex xTAG RVP FAST v2 Assay Kit. RESULTS: Out of the 38 patients with PVOD, rhinoviruses were detected in 13 patients, and coronavirus OC43 was detected in one patient. The frequency of positive virus detection in the patients with anosmia was higher than in those with hyposmia (58.8% vs. 19.0%, P = 0.018). In control group, rhinovirus was identified in one patient (3.1%). Nasal obstruction was the most common symptom and was experienced by 71.0% of patients. CONCLUSIONS: Rhinovirus and coronavirus are more commonly identified in PVOD. Our methods represent an approach to screen for viruses that may be involved in PVOD.

We previously developed an approach to identify interfering medications using electronic health record (EHR) data, but the approach was limited to UDS assays for which presumptive positives were confirmed using more specific methods. Here we adapted the approach to search for medications that cause false positives on UDS assays lacking confirmation data. From our institution's EHR data, we used our previous dataset of 698,651 UDS and confirmation results. We also collected 211,108 UDS results for acetaminophen, ethanol, and salicylates. Both datasets included individuals' prior medication exposures. We hypothesized that the odds of a presumptive positive would increase following exposure to an interfering medication independently of exposure to the assay's target drug(s). For a given assay-medication pair, we quantified potential interference as an odds ratio from logistic regression. We evaluated interference of selected compounds in spiking experiments. Compared to the approach requiring confirmation data, our adapted approach showed only modestly diminished ability to detect interfering medications. Applying our approach to the new data, we discovered and validated multiple compounds that can cause presumptive positives on the UDS assay for acetaminophen. Our approach can reveal interfering medications using EHR data from institutions at which UDS results are not routinely confirmed.","Ayala-Lopez, Nadia; Aref, Layla; Colby, Jennifer M; Hughey, Jacob J",J. anal. toxicol,188,1

Little is known about the relationship between older adults using social media during a pandemic and their anxiety, their attitudes toward social trust in information, and behaviors to avoid contracting COVID-19. OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study was to investigate the associations between using social media for COVID-19-related information and anxiety symptoms as well as the mediation effect of anxiety symptoms on social trust in information and COVID-safe behaviors among older adults. METHODS: A cross-sectional telephone survey was conducted in Hong Kong between May and August 2020. A rapid warm-call protocol was developed to train social workers and volunteers from participant nongovernmental organizations to conduct the telephone surveys.

Since the demand for commercial, full-featured ventilators is far higher than the supply capacity, many rapid-response ventilators are being developed for invasive mechanical ventilation of patients. Most of these emergency ventilators utilize mechanical squeezing of bag-valve-masks or Ambu-bags. These""bag squeezer""designs are bulky and heavy, depends on many moving parts, and difficulty to assemble and use. Also, invasive ventilation requires intensive care unit support, which may be unavailable to a vast majority of patients, especially in developing countries. In this work, we present a low-cost ($<$\$200), portable (fits in an 8""x8""x4""box), non-invasive ventilator (NIV), designed to provide relief to early-stage COVID-19 patients in low-resource settings. We used a high-pressure blower fan for providing noninvasive positive-pressure ventilation. Our design supports continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) and bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPAP) modes. A common concern of using CPAP or BiPAP for treating COVID-19 patients is the aerosolization of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). We used a helmet-based solution that contains the spread of the virus. Our end-to-end solution is compact, low-cost ($<$\$400 including the helmet, viral filters, and a valve), and easy-to-use. Our NIV provides 0-20 cmH$_{2}$O pressure with flow rates of 60-180 Lmin$^{-1}$.

Within a few weeks, a novel coronavirus tentatively named as 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) was announced by the World Health Organization. We performed bioinformatics analysis on a virus genome from a patient with 2019-nCoV infection and compared it with other related coronavirus genomes. Overall, the genome of 2019-nCoV has 89% nucleotide identity with bat SARS-like-CoVZXC21 and 82% with that of human SARS-CoV. The phylogenetic trees of their orf1a/b, Spike, Envelope, Membrane and Nucleoprotein also clustered closely with those of the bat, civet and human SARS coronaviruses. However, the external subdomain of Spike's receptor binding domain of 2019-nCoV shares only 40% amino acid identity with other SARS-related coronaviruses. Remarkably, its orf3b encodes a completely novel short protein. Furthermore, its new orf8 likely encodes a secreted protein with an alpha-helix, following with a beta-sheet(s) containing six strands. Learning from the roles of civet in SARS and camel in MERS, hunting for the animal source of 2019-nCoV and its more ancestral virus would be important for understanding the origin and evolution of this novel lineage B betacoronavirus. These findings provide the basis for starting further studies on the pathogenesis, and optimizing the design of diagnostic, antiviral and vaccination strategies for this emerging infection.","Chan, Jasper Fuk-Woo; Kok, Kin-Hang; Zhu, Zheng; Chu, Hin; To, Kelvin Kai-Wang; Yuan, Shuofeng; Yuen, Kwok-Yung",Emerg Microbes Infect,188,20

Homozygosity for haplotype rs3849266*C_rs2274567*A (CA/CA genotype) was associated with susceptibility to AD (OR = 2.94, p = 0.018). Patients presented higher sCR1 levels in plasma than controls (p = 0.038).

This is the first study to validate the association of CR1 polymorphisms with late-onset Alzheimer's disease, as well as to evaluate sCR1 levels in a Latin American population. SNPs present in the regulatory and coding regions of this gene may be playing a key role in the observed association, probably by interfering in Aß plaques clearance. Inhibition may be due to the increase in local sCR1 levels observed in patients, which may result from polymorphisms leading to larger isoforms of CR1 and/or structural alterations of the protein that makes it less functional, as well as increased vesiculation of the molecules.","Kretzschmar, Gabriela Canalli; Antoniazzi, Angela Adriane Hanel; Oliveira, Luana Caroline; Nisihara, Renato Mitsunori; Petzl-Erler, Maria Luiza; de Souza, Ricardo Lehtonen R; Boldt, Angelica Beate Winter",J. mol. neurosci,188,16

Dermatology units experienced a reorganization of regular activity, also providing clinical diagnosis and medical assistance to COVID-19-positive patients who developed cutaneous manifestations. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on Italian dermatologic clinical practice. MATERIALS & METHODS: This was a prospective online survey, consisting of a questionnaire with 35 multiple-choice questions uploaded on the website of the Italian Society of Dermatology and Venereology - SIDeMaST. RESULTS: A total of 136 dermatologists, 78 women (57%) and 58 men (43%), participated in the survey. The mean age was 58 ± 14 years. In total, 60% of participants reported an impact of the pandemic on their practice, in most cases consisting of a remarkable reduction in routine clinical activity (58%). Concern regarding possible infection was evaluated with a score ranging from 0 (no concern) to 5 (extremely concerned): the fear of becoming infected was high (&#8805;3 in 40%), as was the fear of infecting families, colleagues or patients (&#8805;3 points in 45%). CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemic is having a strong impact on dermatology practice in Italy. The identification of critical points may help scientific societies to improve the clinical scenario and create specific strategies to overcome the emergency.","Lambertini, Martina; Patrizi, Annalisa; Peris, Ketty; Marasco, Giovanni; Toselli, Marco; Marcelli, Emanuela; Giampieri, Enrico; Mussi, Martina; Dika, Emi",Eur J Dermatol,188,1

It has drawn great attention from the WHO and was declared an international public health emergency on January 31, 2020. Because the population is generally susceptible to the virus, there are no effective drugs and vaccines, and active participation of the entire population in self-protection and self-isolation has become the key to cutting off transmission routes and effectively controlling the epidemic. A self-designed questionnaire to assess residents' knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors related to COVID-19 prevention and control used the Questionnaire Star service platform, and snowball sampling was used to invite rural residents to complete the questionnaire on WeChat. A total of 554 valid questionnaires were collected. Rural residents' average scores on knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors regarding prevention and control were 40 ± 7 (total of 50 points), 45 ± 3 (total of 52 points), and 92 ± 12 (total of 127 points), respectively. A lack of protective materials and weak awareness of prevention and control are the greatest difficulties and challenges experienced by rural residents during the epidemic. Accordingly, social support services, such as public transportation plans, supply chains for living materials, and orderly returns to work, need to be strengthened. Moreover, new infectious disease control is not only a task for individuals but also a global issue. It is of great significance to guarantee information transparency and enhance health risk communication.","Ma, Lihua; Liu, Hui; Tao, Zhang; Jiang, Ning; Wang, Song; Jiang, Xiaolian",Am J Trop Med Hyg,188,21

The same mystery applies to the deadly 1918 H1N1 influenza pandemic, which has puzzled the field for a century. Here we discuss dual potential properties of the 1918 H1N1 pandemic viruses that led to the high fatality rate in the small portion of severe cases, while about 98% infected persons in the United States were self-limited with mild symptoms, or even asymptomatic. These variations now have been postulated to be impacted by polymorphisms of the sialic acid receptors in the general population. Since coronaviruses (CoVs) also recognize sialic acid receptors and cause severe acute respiratory syndrome epidemics and pandemics, similar principles of influenza virus evolution and pandemicity may also apply to CoVs. A potential common principle of pathogen/host co-evolution of influenza and CoVs under selection of host sialic acids in parallel with different epidemic and pandemic influenza and coronaviruses is discussed.","Jiang, Xi; Tan, Ming; Xia, Ming; Huang, Pengwei; Kennedy, Michael A",Emerg Microbes Infect,188,0

Investigators interviewed suspected COVID-19 cases to collect epidemiological information, including demographic characteristics, illness onset, hospital visits, close contacts, activities' trajectories between 14 days before illness onset and isolation, and exposure histories. Respiratory specimens of suspected cases were collected and tested for SARS-CoV-2 by real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) assay. The interval between the onset of illness in the primary case and the last contact of the secondary case with the primary case in our report was 1 to 7 days. In Cluster 1 (five cases), illness onset in the five secondary cases was 2 to 5 days after the last contact with the primary case. In Cluster 2 (five cases) and Cluster 3 (four cases), the illness onset in secondary cases occurred prior to or on the same day as the onset in the primary cases. The study provides empirical evidence for transmission of COVID-19 during the incubation period and indicates that pre-symptomatic person-to-person transmission can occur following sufficient exposure to confirmed COVID-19 cases. The potential pre-symptomatic person-to-person transmission puts forward higher requirements for prevention and control measures.","Gong, Xiaohuan; Xiao, Wenjia; Cui, Yan; Wang, Yuanping; Kong, Dechuan; Mao, Shenghua; Zheng, Yaxu; Xiang, Lunhui; Lu, Lu; Jiang, Chenyan; Yu, Xiao; Zhu, Yiyi; Fang, Qiwen; Pan, Hao; Wu, Huanyu",Euro surveill,188,16

As an objective of this communication, we propose to analyse the level of digital competences of European university teaching staff, in addition to detecting good practices in teaching and guidance using ICT. This is a mixed-method research study in which 918 teachers participated in the quantitative part and 76 in the qualitative part. As an instrument, the scale Necesidades formativas en estrategias orientadoras y tutoriales (NFEOT-17) has been used for quantitative research, and the techniques of discussion group, nominal group and the SWOT (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities and Threats) technique have been used for qualitative research. The results show that low digital competence is manifested in relation to teaching and university orientation. Furthermore, determining factors have been detected that characterise good ICT practices.

OBJECTIVES: To study how COVID-19 affected cancer deaths regarding age, sex, socio-economic status, comorbidities, and access to palliative care. An additional objective was to study changes in place of care and death. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A descriptive, retrospective study of all cancer patients who died during March-May 2020 in the Stockholm region, n = 1467 of which 278 died with a COVID-19 diagnosis, compared with deaths in 2016-2019. The Stockholm Regional Council's central data warehouse was used. T-tests, 95% CI, Wilcoxon and chi-squared tests were used for comparisons. RESULTS: There were excess cancer deaths compared with 2016-2019 (p < 0.001) and patients dying with a COVID-19 diagnosis were older (79.7 vs. 75.9 years, p < 0.0001), more often male (67% vs. 55%, p < 0.0001), and had more comorbidities (Charlson Comorbidity Index 1.6 vs. 1.1, p < 0.0001). Patients with COVID-19 more seldom had access to palliative care (34% vs. 59%, p = 0.008), had more changes in place of care during the last two weeks of life (p < 0.0001) and died more often in acute hospitals (34% vs. 14%, p < 0.0001). For the subgroup with access to palliative care, the hospital deaths for individuals with and without a COVID-19 diagnosis were 11% and 4%, respectively (p = 0.008). CONCLUSION: Cancer patients dying with a COVID-19 diagnosis were older, more often male, and had more comorbidities. A COVID-19 diagnosis negatively affected the probability of being admitted to specialized palliative care and increased the likelihood of dying in an acute hospital.","Strang, Peter; Hedman, Christel; Adlitzer, Helena; Schultz, Torbjörn",Acta Oncol,188,10

The aim of the study was to explore hematological and biochemical parameters at admission to the hospital as novel early predictors for diagnosis with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) among all suspected patients. METHODS: This was a retrospective, multicenter, observational study. The clinical data of all suspected patients were analyzed. The suspected patients with negative RT-PCR results were included as the control group, and compared with confirmed patients. Receiver- operating characteristic (ROC) curves and logistic regression analyses were used to evaluate the hematological indexes. RESULTS: In total, 326 confirmed COVID-19 patients and 116 control patients were included. The predictive ability of combinations of the hematological and biochemical parameters was significantly superior to that of a single parameter. The area under the ROC curve (AUC) of the aspartate aminotransferase (AST) to neutrophil ratio index (ANRI) and the AST to monocyte ratio index (AMRI) were 0.791 and 0.812, respectively. In the multivariate analysis, an ANRI &#8805; 6.03(OR: 3.26, 95% CI: 1.02-10.40, P=0.046) and an AMRI &#8805; 36.32(OR: 3.64. 95% CI: 1.24-10.68, P=0.02) at admission were independent risk factors related to the occurrence of COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: We found two novel predictors with promising predictive capacities for COVID-19 among all suspected patients: ANRI and AMRI. Our findings need to be confirmed in further studies.","Huang, Dong; Yang, Huan; Yu, He; Wang, Ting; Chen, Zhu; Yao, Rong; Liang, Zongan",Am. j. med. sci,188,16

The first case of COVID-19 was confirmed in Bangladesh on 8th March, 2020 and consequently the country went into lockdown on 26 March, 2020. This study has made a survey of vegetables farmers through a mobile phone to understand the impact of COVID-19 on vegetables supply chain, gross margin and the future production plan of the growers. In Bangladesh, the lockdown has disrupted the food supply chain and increases the likelihood of food insecurity. Lockdown has impeded vegetable farmers' access to markets, thus limiting their productive and sales capacities. The price of yield has dropped by more than half resulting in huge loss for vegetable growers. The loss incurred by the farmers for producing Brinjal, Cucumber, Pointed gourd, Yardlong beans and Bottle gourd are BDT 4900, BDT 10900, BDT 57400, BDT 52500 and BDT 18500 per acre respectively as a result of COVID-19. The decreased income increases farmers' likelihood of vulnerability and food insecurity and poses a challenge to continued produce. 'Cash support' is more important than 'food support' in order to keep vegetable farmers in farming, to ensure a ready supply of necessary low-cost resources, and to help fight against the upcoming food shortage.","Alam, G M Monirul; Khatun, Most Nilufa",PLoS One,188,32

Lack of resources, both human and material, amplifies the likelihood of contamination in these facilities where a single employee can contaminate dozens of residents and colleagues. Improving the dissemination of and adhesion to infection prevention and control (IPC) guidelines is therefore essential. Serious games have been shown to be effective in developing knowledge and in increasing engagement and could motivate nursing home employees to change their IPC practices. OBJECTIVE: Our aim is to assess the impact of ""Escape COVID-19"", a serious game designed to enhance knowledge and application of IPC procedures, on the intention of nursing home employees to change their IPC practices. METHODS: We will carry out a web-based, randomized controlled trial following the CONSORT-EHEALTH guidelines and incorporating relevant elements of the CHERRIES checklist. Participants will be randomized to either the control or the serious game (intervention) group. First, both groups will be asked to answer a questionnaire designed to gather demographic data and assess baseline knowledge. The control group will then access a quick reminder of the current national guidelines and links to IPC guidelines for healthcare professionals, while the other group will follow the game. Both groups will then have to answer a second questionnaire designed to assess their willingness to change their IPC practices after having followed their respective material. After completing this questionnaire, they will be granted access to the material presented to the group they were not assigned to and receive a course completion certificate. The primary outcome will be the proportion of participants willing to change their IPC practices according to group. Secondary outcomes will include the analysis of specific questions detailing the exact changes considered by the participants. Factors associated with participant willingness or reluctance to change behaviour will also be assessed. Attrition will also be assessed at each stage of the study. RESULTS: The study protocol has been presented to our regional ethics committee (Req-2020-01262), which issued a declaration of no objection as such projects do not fall within the scope of the Swiss federal law on human research. Data collection began on November 5th and should be completed by December 4th, 2020.

STUDY SELECTION, DATA EXTRACTION, AND SYNTHESIS: One investigator identified articles for inclusion, abstracted data, and performed quality assessment, with second reviewer checking. RESULTS: Incidence of thromboembolism among hospitalized patients with COVID-19 ranged from 25 to 53% in 4 retrospective series. We identified 3 studies (1 retrospective cohort study, 1 prospective uncontrolled observational study, and 1 case series) examining outcomes among COVID-19 patients who received antithrombotic therapies. These studies all included different interventions (thromboprophylaxis with unfractionated heparin (UFH) or low molecular-weight heparin (LMWH); an intensive thromboprophylaxis protocol with LMWH, antithrombin, and clopidogrel; and salvage therapy with tissue plasminogen activator and heparin). These studies are overall poor quality due to methodological limitations including unclear patient selection protocols, lack of reporting or adjustment for patient baseline characteristics, inadequate duration of follow-up, and partial reporting of outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: New evidence on thromboembolism in COVID-19 does not warrant a change in current guidance on thromboprophylaxis among hospitalized patients.

Understanding the factors affecting the pattern and levels of expression of these genes is important for deeper understanding of SARS-CoV-2 tropism and pathogenesis. Here we explore the role of genetics and co-expression networks in regulating these genes in the airway, through the analysis of nasal airway transcriptome data from 695 children. We identify expression quantitative trait loci for both ACE2 and TMPRSS2, that vary in frequency across world populations. We find TMPRSS2 is part of a mucus secretory network, highly upregulated by type 2 (T2) inflammation through the action of interleukin-13, and that the interferon response to respiratory viruses highly upregulates ACE2 expression. IL-13 and virus infection mediated effects on ACE2 expression were also observed at the protein level in the airway epithelium. Finally, we define airway responses to common coronavirus infections in children, finding that these infections generate host responses similar to other viral species, including upregulation of IL6 and ACE2.

While several studies have reported the association between frailty and COVID-19 mortality or length of hospital stay, there have been no community-based studies on the association between frailty and risk of severe infection. Considering that different definitions have been identified to assess frailty, this study aimed to compare the association between frailty and severe COVID-19 infection in UK Biobank using two frailty classifications: the frailty phenotype and the frailty index. METHODS: A total of 383,845 UK Biobank participants recruited 2006-2010 in England (211,310 [55.1%] women, baseline age 37-73 years) were included. COVID-19 test data were provided by Public Health England (available up to 28 June 2020). An adapted version of the frailty phenotype derived by Fried et al. was used to define frailty phenotype (robust, pre-frail, or frail). A previously validated frailty index was derived from 49 self-reported questionnaire items related to health, disease and disability, and mental wellbeing (robust, mild frailty, and moderate/severe frailty). Both classifications were derived from baseline data (2006-2010). Poisson regression models with robust standard errors were used to analyse the associations between both frailty classifications and severe COVID-19 infection (resulting in hospital admission or death), adjusted for sociodemographic and lifestyle factors. RESULTS: Of UK Biobank participants included, 802 were admitted to hospital with and/or died from COVID19 (323 deaths and 479 hospitalisations). After analyses were adjusted for sociodemographic and lifestyle factors, a higher risk of COVID-19 was observed for pre-frail (risk ratio (RR) 1.47 [95% CI 1.26; 1.71]) and frail (RR 2.66 [95% CI 2.04; 3.47]) individuals compared to those classified as robust using the frailty phenotype. Similar results were observed when the frailty index was used (RR mildly frail 1.46 [95% CI 1.26; 1.71] and RR moderate/severe frailty 2.43 [95% CI 1.91; 3.10]). CONCLUSIONS: Frailty was associated with a higher risk of severe COVID-19 infection resulting in hospital admission or death, irrespective of how it was measured and independent of sociodemographic and lifestyle factors.

It is possible that the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic will also have long-term impacts on the cohort that was in utero during the pandemic, from exposure to maternal infection and/or the stress of the pandemic environment. We discuss how COVID-19 disease during pregnancy may affect fetal and postnatal development with adverse impacts on health and aging. Severe maternal infections are associated with an exaggerated inflammatory response, thromboembolic events, and placental vascular malperfusion. We also discuss how in utero exposure to the stress of the pandemic, without maternal infection, may impact health and aging. Several recently initiated birth cohort studies are tracking neonatal health following in utero severe acute respiratory syndrome virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) exposure. We suggest these cohort studies develop plans for longer-term observations of physical, behavioral, and cognitive functions that are markers for accelerated aging, as well as methods to disentangle the effects of maternal infection from stresses of the pandemic environment. In utero exposure to COVID-19 disease could cause developmental difficulties and accelerated aging in the century ahead. This brief review summarizes elements of the developmental origins of health, disease, and ageing and discusses how the COVID-19 pandemic might exacerbate such effects. We conclude with a call for research on the long-term consequences of in utero exposure to maternal infection with COVID-19 and stresses of the pandemic environment.","Easterlin, Molly Crimmins; Crimmins, Eileen M; Finch, Caleb E",J Dev Orig Health Dis,188,1

Therefore, it is important to understand COVID-19 characteristics across different countries. Methods: This is a cross-sectional descriptive study of 525 hospitalized symptomatic COVID-19 patients, from the central federal hospital in Dubai-UAE during period of March to August 2020. Results: UAE's COVID-19 patients were relatively young; mean (SD) of the age 49(15) years, 130 (25%) were older than 60 and 4 (<1%) were younger than 18 years old. Majority were male(47; 78%). The mean (SD) BMI was 29 (6) kg/m2. While the source of contracting COVID-19 was not known in 369 (70%) of patients, 29 (6%) reported travel to overseas-country and 127 (24%) reported contact with another COVID-19 case/s. At least one comorbidity was present in 284 (54%) of patients and 241 (46%) had none. The most common comorbidities were diabetes (177; 34%) and hypertension (166; 32%). The mean (SD) of symptoms duration was 6 (3) days. The most common symptoms at hospitalization were fever (340; 65%), cough (296; 56%), and shortness of breath (SOB) (243; 46%). Most of the laboratory values were within normal range, but (184; 35%) of patients had lymphopenia, 43 (8%) had neutrophilia, and 116 (22%) had prolong international normalized ratio (INR), and 317 (60%) had high D-dimer. Chest x ray findings of consolidation was present in 334 (64%) of patients and CT scan ground glass appearance was present in 354 (68%). Acute cardiac injury occurred in 124 (24%), acute kidney injury in 111 (21%), liver injury in 101 (19%), ARDS in 155 (30%), acidosis in 118 (22%), and septic shock in 93 (18%). Consequently, 150 (29%) required ICU admission with 103 (20%) needed mechanical ventilation. Conclusions: The study demonstrated the special profile of COVID-19 in UAE. Patients were young with diabetes and/or hypertension and associated with severe infection as shown by various clinical and laboratory data necessitating ICU admission.","Hannawi, Suad; Hannawi, Haifa; Naeem, Kashif Bin; Elemam, Noha Mousaad; Hachim, Mahmood Y; Hachim, Ibrahim Y; Darwish, Abdulla Salah; Al Salmi, Issa",Front Cell Infect Microbiol,188,24

The main route of transmission is believed to be through coronavirus-bearing respiratory droplets. The respiratory droplets have a wide spectrum in droplet size, ranging from very small droplets (aerosol droplets) to large droplets of tens and even hundreds of µm in size. The large droplets are expected to move like projectiles under the action of gravity force, buoyancy force and air resistance. Droplet motion is complicated by droplet evaporation, which reduces droplet size in its trajectory and affects the force acting on it. The present work attempts to determine the trajectories of the large droplets by using a simplified single-droplet approach. It aims at providing a clear physical picture to elucidate the mechanics involved in single droplet motion and the various factors affecting the range. Assuming an indoor environment with an air temperature of 18 °C and relative humidity of 50%, the horizontal range L x of large respiratory droplets (diameter 120 µm-200 µm) in common respiratory activities are as follows: Speaking, L x &#8776; 0.16 m-0.68 m, coughing, L x &#8776; 0.58 m-1.09 m, and sneezing, L x &#8776; 1.34 m-2.76 m. For the smaller droplets (diameter < 100 µm), the droplets are reduced to aerosol droplets (&#8804;5 µm) due to evaporation, and will remain suspended in the air instead of falling onto the ground like a projectile.","Cheng, C H; Chow, C L; Chow, W K",Build Environ,188,12

The purpose of this investigation was to evaluate the changes in PAL and factors associated with PALs among Croatian adolescents while considering the impact of community (urban vs. rural living environment). The sample included 823 adolescents (mean age: 16.5 ± 2.1 years) who were tested on baseline (from October 2019 to March 2020; before COVID-19 pandemic in Croatia) and follow-up (in April 2020; during the COVID-19 pandemic and imposed rules of social distancing). Baseline testing included anthropometrics, physical fitness status, and evaluation of PALs, while follow-up included only PALs (evaluated by a standardized questionnaire through an internet application). The results showed a significant influence of the living environment on the decrease of PAL, with a larger decrease in urban adolescents. Logistic regression showed a higher likelihood for normal PALs at baseline in adolescents who had better fitness status, with no strong confounding effect of the urban/rural environment. The fitness status of urban adolescents predicted their PALs at follow-up. The differences between urban and rural adolescents with regard to the established changes in PALs and relationships between the predictors and PALs are explained by the characteristics of the living communities (lack of organized sports in rural areas), and the level of social distancing in the studied period and region/country.","Zenic, Natasa; Taiar, Redha; Gilic, Barbara; Blazevic, Mateo; Maric, Dora; Pojskic, Haris; Sekulic, Damir",Appl.

Nowadays, an important approach to understand such a phenomenon and its impacts on the lives of people consists of monitoring social networks and news on the Internet. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study is to present a methodology to capture the main subjects and themes under discussion by news and social media, and to apply it to analyse the COVID-19 pandemic in Brazil. METHODS: This work proposes a methodology based on topic modeling, named entity recognition and sentiment analysis of texts to compare Twitter posts and news, followed by an envision of COVID evolution and impacts. We have focused on an analysis in Brazil, one important epicenter of the pandemic in the world, so we have faced the challenge to deal with Brazilian Portuguese texts. RESULTS: This work collected and analysed 18,413 articles from news media, and 1,597,934 tweets posted by 1,299,084 users in Brazil. Results show that the proposed methodology improved the topic-sentiment analysis over time, so a better monitoring of Internet media is allowed. Besides, with this tool, we extracted some interesting insights about COVID evolution in Brazil. For instance, we found out that Twitter presents similar topic coverage from news media, the main entities are similar, but they differ in theme distribution and entity diversity. Besides, some aspects represent a negative sentiment of political theme from both media, and a high incidence of mentions to a specific drug denotes a high political polarization of the pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: This study identified the main themes under discussion in both news and social media and how their sentiment evolved over time. It is possible to understand what are the major public's concerns during the pandemic, and so all the obtained information are useful for decision making by the authorities.","de Melo, Tiago; M S Figueiredo, Carlos",,188,26

We found that (a) the awareness of the disease plays the central role in preventing disease outbreak; (b) we need a reasonable ratio of""over-reacting""nodes to effectively control the disease outbreak; (c) diseases with a longer incubation period and a higher recovery rate are easier to control because the processes of information diffusion and behavior change can help people prepare for the upcoming exposure to the disease; (d) it is more difficult to control the disease with asymptomatic cases.

It evoked a vigorous response in clinical medicine, as it required rapid development and delivery of COVID-19 vaccines in less than a year (Le et al., 2020). Similarly, medical education also adapted with the same rate and intensity as its clinical counterparts. Infection control and mitigation measures evolved to limit viral spread. The CDC issued stay-at-home orders and directives to close non-essential places. This included medical schools, which are considered high population density (CDC, 2021). Consequently, traditional in-person didactics were compromised;educational delivery went to socially-distanced online modes. Remote online-learning of medical education includes video conferences for lectures, assessments of diagnostic and clinical skills via online modes, and virtual-simulation use to aid problem-based learning. Adaptive online-learning for medical education boosts strong cooperation from faculty and students to meld curriculum to retain competency and accreditation requirements for students to graduate and become physicians. This study examines online lecture effectiveness during COVID-19, specifically pathology, as medical students shift to optimize learning for board exam preparation and transition to clinical settings. Methods In this preliminary study, second year medical students at a US osteopathic medical school were anonymously surveyed in 2020-2021 academic year. Target demographic was medical students required to use online learning due to COVID-19;students had live, in-person instruction in previous academic year, 2019-2020, until the shift to online learning started March 2020. Data from survey included quantitative data on effectiveness of online learning versus in-person lecture for medical students, impact of online learning on students? foundational pathology preparation for board exams, and students' abilities to apply pathology knowledge with diagnostic reasoning in a clinical setting. Preliminary results show online learning of pathology in preparation for board exams elicited moderate confidence from 58% of second-year medical students;a majority of students to report online learning as quite effective. Ninety-two percent of students used external pathology resources (review books, video series, etc.) with online learning. However, more than half of students report low confidence in applying pathology knowledge in a clinical setting. Discussion Overall, medical students showed moderate confidence in pathology board exam preparation via online learning. A study conducted by Mukhtar et al. (2020) supported online learning in medical schools due to increased student-centered learning. Students using external board review resources found online learning provides efficient pathology curriculum management with time for board exam review during the pandemic. Most students reported low confidence in applying pathology knowledge in a clinical setting because online learning constraints include lack of integration of clinical pathology and clinical competency skills. Future studies will assess effectiveness of online learning with improved methods to implement pathology curriculum in clinical settings.","Tran, Elena Torelli Vincent Lomiguen Christine",The FASEB Journal,188,14

OBJECTIVES: Describing characteristics, consultation demands, patients' needs, and outcomes of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 who received a palliative care evaluation. METHODS: Retrospective chart review of patients (aged 18+ years) with COVID-19 admitted to an academic quaternary center and seen by the geriatrics and palliative medicine team from March 1st to May 11th, 2020. Socio-demographics, operational metrics, severity of illness, goals of care-advanced care planning documentation, and outcomes were analyzed. RESULTS: Three hundred seventy-six (17.6%) out of 2138 COVID-19 admissions were seen by the consultation team. Compared with prepandemic situation (September 1st, 2019, to February 29th, 2020), overall new consults (205 vs. 371, P < 0.001) significantly increased, particularly in the intensive care unit (ICU; 9.5% vs. 36.9%, P < 0.001). For the COVID-19 population, median age was 78 years (interquartile range, 70-87; range, 36-102); 56% were male. LACE score, D-dimer, and C-reactive protein suggested severe disease and increased risk of mortality. Seventy-five percent of consults were for goals of care-advanced care planning, and 9.6% for symptoms. During the index admission, 7.1% had documented advanced directives, and 69.7% became do not resuscitate. Of all deaths, 55.5% were in the ICU, and 87.2% were aged &#8805;65 years. Underserved minority patients had a disproportionate mortality. Overall consultation mortality (38.3% vs. 70.4%, P < 0.001) and ICU mortality (55.2% vs. 78.1%, P < 0.001) significantly increased compared with those before COVID-19. CONCLUSION: During this pandemic, understanding inpatient specialized palliative care needs and the vulnerable populations driving these causes may encourage health-care agencies and local, state, and federal governments to support the dedicated palliative care workforce.","Lopez, Santiago; Finuf, Kayla D; Marziliano, Allison; Sinvani, Liron; Burns, Edith A",J. pain symptom manage,188,18

By adopting the steps and other components of organizational learning, healthcare institutions can convert themselves into learning organizations and ultimately strengthen the overall healthcare system of the country. The present study aimed to examine the influence of several organizational learning dimensions on organization culture in healthcare settings during the COVID-19 outbreak. METHODS: During COVID-19 crisis in 2020, an online cross-sectional study was performed. Data were collected via official emails sent to 1500 healthcare professionals working in front line at four sets of hospitals in Saudi Arabia. Basic descriptive analysis was constructed to identify the variation between the four healthcare organizations. A multiple regression was employed to explore how hospitals can adopt learning process during pandemics, incorporating several Dimensions of Learning Organizations Questionnaire (DLOQ) developed by Marsick and Watkins (2003) and Leufvén and others (2015). RESULTS: Organizational learning including system connections (M = 3.745), embedded systems (M = 3.732), and team work and collaborations (M = 3.724) tended to have major significant relationships with building effective learning organization culture. Staff empowerment, dialogues and inquiry, internal learning culture, and continuous learning had the lowest effect on building health organization culture (M = 3.680, M = 3.3.679, M = 3.673, M = 3.663, respectively). A multiple linear regression was run to predict learning organization based on the several variables. These variables statistically significantly predicted learning organization, F (6, 1124) = 168.730, p < .0005, R2 = 0.471, (p < .05). DISCUSSION: The findings concluded that although intrinsic factors like staff empowerment, dialogues and inquiry, and internal learning culture, revealed central roles, still the most crucial factors toward the development of learning organization culture were extrinsic ones including connections, embed system and collaborations. CONCLUSIONS: Until knowledge-sharing is embedded in health organizational systems; organizations may not maintain a high level of learning during crisis.","Alonazi, Wadi B",BMC Health Serv Res,188,1

Here, we aimed to evaluate autoantibodies targeting NETs in patients with primary APS, and to determine their potential functions and clinical associations. METHOD: We measured global anti-NET activity in 76 patients with primary APS, 23 patients with systemic lupus erythematosus without antiphospholipid antibodies (aPL), 11 patients with history of unprovoked venous thrombosis without aPL, and 44 healthy controls. The ability of APS sera to degrade NETs was also assessed. RESULT: We found markedly elevated levels of anti-NET IgG and IgM in patients with primary APS as compared with healthy controls (IgG mean optical density 0.55 ± 0.34 vs. 0.33 ± 0.17; IgM mean optical density 0.76 ± 0.51 vs. 0.26 ± 0.23). This anti-NET activity did not correlate with levels of traditional aPL and was relatively stable over time. Mechanistically, anti-NET antibodies (especially of the IgG isotype) impaired the ability of patient sera to degrade NETs (r=0.4, p=0.003). Levels of anti-NET IgM inversely correlated with complement C4 (r=0.4, p=0.019). Clinically, anti-NET antibodies associated with certain APS clinical manifestations, and in particular recurrent venous thrombosis (OR=4.3, p=0.002). Interestingly, anti-NET antibodies also appeared to associate with unprovoked venous thrombosis in the general population (IgM mean optical density 0.67 ± 0.34 vs. 0.26 ± 0.23). CONCLUSION: These data reveal high levels of anti-NET antibodies in patients with primary APS, which may impair NET clearance and activate the complement cascade. These findings may ultimately enable more effective risk stratification.","Zuo, Yu; Yalavarthi, Srilakshmi; Gockman, Kelsey; Madison, Jacqueline A; Gudjonsson, Johann E; Kahlenberg, J Michelle; McCune, W Joseph; Bockenstedt, Paula L; Karp, David R; Knight, Jason S",Arthritis rheumatol.

We introduce a 2-parameter generalized-growth model to characterize the ascending phase of an outbreak and capture epidemic profiles ranging from sub-exponential to exponential growth. We test the model against empirical outbreak data representing a variety of viral pathogens and provide simulations highlighting the importance of sub-exponential growth for forecasting purposes. We applied the generalized-growth model to 20 infectious disease outbreaks representing a range of transmission routes. We uncovered epidemic profiles ranging from very slow growth (p=0.14 for the Ebola outbreak in Bomi, Liberia (2014)) to near exponential (p>0.9 for the smallpox outbreak in Khulna (1972), and the 1918 pandemic influenza in San Francisco). The foot-and-mouth disease outbreak in Uruguay displayed a profile of slower growth while the growth pattern of the HIV/AIDS epidemic in Japan was approximately linear. The West African Ebola epidemic provided a unique opportunity to explore how growth profiles vary by geography; analysis of the largest district-level outbreaks revealed substantial growth variations (mean p=0.59, range: 0.14-0.97). Our findings reveal significant variation in epidemic growth patterns across different infectious disease outbreaks and highlights that sub-exponential growth is a common phenomenon. Sub-exponential growth profiles may result from heterogeneity in contact structures or risk groups, reactive behavior changes, or the early onset of interventions strategies, and consideration of""deceleration parameters""may be useful to refine existing mathematical transmission models and improve disease forecasts.","Viboud, C'ecile; Simonsen, Lone; Chowell, Gerardo",,188,1

Several lines of evidence suggest that surveillance of sewage and waste can provide an early warning sign for COVID-19 recurrence in a community. In support, SARS-CoV-2 traces were found in sewage in several countries. With this in mind, it is notable that pests, such as cockroaches, are exposed to pathogenic microbes routinely, yet thrive in polluted environments. Such species have likely developed mechanisms to protect themselves against pathogens. In support, recent studies showed that cockroaches possess potent antibacterial molecules to shield themselves from pathogenic bacteria. Among hundreds of molecules, some contained thiazine groups, imidazoles, chromene derivatives, isoquinoline group, sulfonamides, pyrrole-containing analogs, flavanones, and furanones. Here, we propose that cockroaches are a potential source of antiviral molecules to thwart infections. Because this is an unexploited resource for potential antivirals, we believe that cockroaches offer a unique source for novel bioactive molecule(s) to counter COVID-19 with huge clinical impact worldwide.","Siddiqui, Ruqaiyyah; Khan, Naveed Ahmed",ACS chem. neurosci,188,2

Army camp read: “These men start with what appears to be an ordinary attack of LaGrippe or Influenza, and when brought to the Hosp they very rapidly develop the most vicious type of pneumonia that has ever been seen… and a few hours later you can begin to see the Cyanosis extending from their ears and spreading all over the face until it is hard to distinguish the colored men from the white It is only a matter of a few hours then until death comes… It is horrible One can stand it to see one, two or twenty men die, but to see these poor devils dropping like flies… We have been averaging about 100 deaths per day… Pneumonia means in about all cases death… We have lost an outrageous number of Nurses and Drs It takes special trains to carry away the dead For several days there were no coffins and the bodies piled up something fierce… It beats any sight they ever had in France after a battle An extra long barracks has been vacated for the use of the Morgue, and it would make any man sit up and take notice to walk down the long lines of dead soldiers all dressed and laid out in double rows… Good By old Pal, God be with you till we meet again ” (1) This letter shed some light on the scenario of the 1918 influenza pandemic What the physician had not foreseen was that this disease would cause 50 million people to die in the following year — many more deaths than those caused by the two World Wars The 1918 “Spanish Flu” was the first influenza pandemic in the 20th century and also the most lethal one Following this one, 3 more influenza pandemics have occurred as of 2020, including the 1957 H1N1, 1968 H3N2, and the 2009 H1N1, though the 1977 “Russian Flu” caused by H1N1 has also led to concentrated epidemics around the world Compared with the 1918 pandemic, the later influenza viruses showed lower morbidity and mortality, but 100 years after the 1918 “Spanish Flu”, we confronted a second severe pandemic disease caused by the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) (2–3) Up to October 28, 2020, this virus has caused 43,906,632 cases in the world with over 1 million deaths (4) Unlike the highly genetically related SARS-CoV virus that causes severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), which abated quickly because of aggressive containment procedures and relatively lower transmission capacity, COVID-19 continues spreading globally and is expected to circulate in the population in the near future Using lessons learned from combating influenza pandemics over the past 100 years, we can use this historical perspective in our battle against COVID-19 As stated by John Barry, the most important lesson from the 1918 influenza is to “tell the truth” (5) In 1918, due to the pressure to maintain wartime morale, neither national nor local government officials told the truth to the public However, Spain was neutral in the First World War, and newspapers there could report on the disease so it was generally perceived that the pandemic had originated from Spain and led to the misnaming of the disease as the “Spanish Flu” (6–7) In countries that silenced the press, trust in authority deteriorated as the death toll increased, and this led to increased vulnerability amongst the population Because effective pharmaceuticals either did not exist or were not readily available, most cities suffered a tremendous death toll during the 1918 pandemic However, cities that had imposed multiple social containment measures within a few days of detecting the first local cases had peak deaths rates of up to 50% lower than other cities that waited weeks to respond (8) Early implementation of some interventions, including the closure of schools, churches, and theater, was associated with lower peak death rates, but no single intervention showed an association with improved outcomes (8) In addition, the benefit of these multiple interventions was extremely limited if implemented too late or lifted too early, which indicated that proper timing of the response is crucial to curbing the effects of a pandemic (9) San Francisco, St Louis, Milwaukee, and Kansas City had the most effective public health interventions as they were able to reduce transmission rates by up to 30%–50% (9) The first official preventive measures were implemented in August 1918 and included obligatory notification of suspected cases and community surveillance As the disease spread, closure of public places, banning gathering in crowds, cleaning streets, disinfecting the environment, and limiting the numbers of passengers on public transport, were applied in these three cities (7) Besides the implementation of preventive measures, a worldwide network was established during the 1957 “Asian Flu” pandemic to study the strain soon after it emerged and involved investigators from London, Melbourne, and Washington DC It was also the first time that vaccinations were implemented to protect high-risk individuals (10) Due to the low disease severity and low mortality rates, costly control measures such as school closures or quarantines were thought to be unnecessary in both the 1957 and 1968 pandemic However, the 1968 “Hong Kong Flu” emphasized the importance of a combination of vaccinations, hospitalizations for complicated cases, and antibiotics to treat secondary infections Hand hygiene and voluntary isolation of symptomatic individuals were further recommended in the 2009 H1N1 pandemic (11) These measures that were applied in response to past influenza pandemics were again widely implemented to help contain the COVID-19 pandemic Like the influenza virus, COVID-19 mainly spread via respiratory droplets that are transmitted during close contact (12) and the direct contact of the infectious surface through hands and other body parts, which means that social distancing strategies designed to block influenza transmission are also effective against COVID-19 Many countries have observed influenza incidence plunging as positive consequence of the public health response to COVID-19 during the 2019–2020 influenza season (13–14) The R0 (reproductive number) for the SARS outbreak in 2003 was estimated to be between 2 0 and 3 0 in the early stage and quickly declined to 1 1 after stringent control measures (15) Studies have estimated the R0 of COVID-19 to be 2 2 (95% CI①: 1 4–3 9) and 2 7 (2 5–2 9) (16–17), though another study has calculated a median R0 value of up to 5 7 (95% CI: 3 8–8 9) (18) By comparison, the initial R0 estimate for the H1N1 influenza pandemic in 2009 was 1 7 and later estimated between 0 17 and 1 3 after control measures were started (15) Because of the higher R0 and fatality rate of COVID-19 compared to the influenza virus, more rigorous policies including active surveillance, contact tracing, mass samples testing, quarantining, and strong social distancing efforts have been needed to stop further transmission of the virus China and other Asian countries have been successful in controlling the spread of COVID-19 through their rigorous and early action Following the SARS epidemic in 2003, China has prioritized developing its early response systems to public health emergencies, and in the 2009 response to H1N1, Richard Stone stated: “No country has taken stricter measures than China to protect residents from pandemic swine flu” (19) As the COVID-19 emerged and spread, China has applied rapid and rigorous containment efforts to block disease transmission, including locking down major cities and reducing transport between affected regions This strategy also included rigorous social distancing, universal temperature monitoring, ubiquitous face masks wearing, and hand washing (20) Similarly, other Asian countries such as Republic of Korea and Vietnam also took aggressive action such as mass testing, movement restriction, and mandatory mask wearing (21) and have also succeeded in disrupting transmission When faced with a novel influenza virus that is rapidly spreading in the human population, an investigation must be conducted to uncover the origin of the virus, the intermediate host, the transmission route, and the clinical features it causes (22) This knowledge could help alert people to take proactive measures to prevent uptake of the virus and its spread As a consequence, global cooperation for information sharing and virology research is needed to face the challenges continuously posed by influenza, and the Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System (GISRS) exemplified such cooperative efforts to combat infectious disease (23) The GISRS currently comprises 142 national influenza centers, 6 World Health Organization (WHO) Collaborating Centres, 4 essential regulatory laboratories, and 13 WHO H5 Reference Laboratories GISRS aims at surveillance and monitoring of seasonal and emerging influenza viruses;recommendations for laboratory diagnostics, vaccines, and antiviral susceptibility;risk assessment for seasonal and pandemic influenza;and detection and response to influenza outbreaks (24) During the 2009 H1N1 pandemic and 2013 avian H7N9 endemic, China cooperated with other countries by sharing virus strains, sequences, and clinical trial information, which greatly contributed to the containment of the disease Thus, a global platform and network similar to GISRS should be established for COVID-19 research and surveillance to integrate the global efforts against COVID-19 worldwide In the struggle against COVID-19, we need stronger global cooperation and solidarity than any time before Humanity has been repeatedly endangered by infectious diseases and, each time so far, has won the fight More infectious diseases are certain to come, though when and where they will emerge cannot be predicted The knowledge accumulated in these battles will prepare us to overcome the crises caused by infectious diseases inthe future Fundings: This work was supported by National Natural Science Foundation of

Oncology nurse must reassure that the patients still get the optimal treatment while in other part they have to keep their patients safe. However, the change of provision of care in order to protect cancer patients must pay more attention. The aim of this paper was to review the literature on both the impact of COVID-19 to the provision of cancer care and nursing workforce. The implications of these findings for cancer patients will also be discussed. The electronic Science direct, Googlescholar and Pubmed databases were used to identify relevant articles. A combination of keywords: cancer, care, Corona virus 19, COVID-19 and Pandemic were used to identify relevant articles. Ten articles were included in the review. The broad issues were the impact of COVID-19 on nursing delivery care and the impact to the workforce. In terms of cancer care delivery, the Oncology teams are adopting new ways to minimise the risk of COVID-19 to the patients and their staff while at the similar times they have to reassure that the patients get the optimum care. Triage patients, adjusting treatment and limitation of visitor?s access to the patients is kind of changes that could do. A serious shortage and the availability of personal protective equipment are the major concern in nursing workforce changes during this pandemic.Planning or resuming cancer treatment and screening to mitigate the risk is the most important way to get the best outcomes. Hence, nurse has been�pushed to adapt quickly and give their optimum nursing care to patients as well as protect themselves from cross infection.","Huda, Nurul",Jurnal Pendidikan Keperawatan Indonesia,188,16

The current study was conducted to assess anxiety and fear of getting infected among dentists while working during the current novel coronavirus diseases (COVID-19) outbreak. In addition, dentists' knowledge about various practice modifications to combat COVID-19 has been evaluated. A cross-sectional study was conducted using an online survey from 10th to 17th March 2020. The well-constructed questionnaire was designed and registered at online website (Kwiksurveys) and validated. A total of 669 participants from 30 different countries across the world responded. After scrutiny, completed questionnaires (n = 650) were included in the study. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS version 25. Chi-Square and Spearman correlation tests were applied to control confounders and assess the relation of dentists' response with respect to gender and educational level. More than two-thirds of the general dental practitioners (78%) from 30 countries questioned were anxious and scared by the devastating effects of COVID-19. A large number of dentists (90%) were aware of recent changes in the treatment protocols. However, execution of amended treatment protocol was recorded as 61%. The majority of the dentists (76%) were working in the hospital setting out of which 74% were from private, and 20% were from government setups. Individually we received a large number of responses from Pakistan and Saudi Arabia, but collectively more than 50% of the responses were from other parts of the world. Despite having a high standard of knowledge and practice, dental practitioners around the globe are in a state of anxiety and fear while working in their respective fields due to the COVID-19 pandemic impact on humanity. A number of dental practices have either modified their services according to the recommended guidelines to emergency treatment only or closed down practices for an uncertain period.","Ahmed, Muhammad Adeel; Jouhar, Rizwan; Ahmed, Naseer; Adnan, Samira; Aftab, Marziya; Zafar, Muhammad Sohail; Khurshid, Zohaib",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),188,16

Because pediatric patients in particular carry and may spread SARS-CoV-2 while asymptomatic, and due to the large amount of respiratory aerosols produced during airway manipulation, an unprecedented risk of provider infection came to exist. Surgical cases were tiered based on urgency and only emergent or urgent cases proceeded using airborne precaution personal protective equipment (PPE)1.

DESIGN: Stepwise demonstration of key skills required when gardening with minimal access techniques. SETTING: Gynecologist residence in self-isolation, Manchester, United Kingdom. INTERVENTIONS: Owing to the coronavirus disease pandemic, elective operations are currently suspended in the United Kingdom. In addition, there have been concerns regarding the safety of laparoscopic surgery and risk of transmission of the coronavirus disease [1,2]. As a result, laparoscopic surgeons are at risk of skill deterioration, and it is uncertain whether this may have an impact on patient safety when lockdown measures are de-escalated. Combining gardening, one of the major pastimes during the lockdown period, and minimal access surgical skills, this video demonstrates the different ways minimal access surgery may be applied to horticulture. In the first described technique, what the author believes to be hedge bindweed (Calystegia sepium) was excised using a grasper and a tripolar cutting device (Fig. 1). For obvious reasons diathermy is not available within the home environment, but the retractable cutting blade was used to efficiently slice through the stems required for weed removal. The disadvantage of this technique is clearly that the unwanted species is likely to regrow in 12 months. In the second described technique, dandelions (genus Taraxacum) (Fig. 2), which are native to Eurasia and North America, were excised at the flowering stage, thereby effectively preventing asexual reproduction by apomixis. The technique similarly uses the retractable blade of the tripolar cutting device. The third technique demonstrates harvesting of an unknown species using a soil dissection technique. To facilitate complete removal of the plant and to reduce the risk of recurrence, the roots are carefully dissected out using blunt dissection. As with many techniques, patience is of paramount importance. Last, ensuring hydration of plants is crucial to their early stage of development. Laparoscopic watering techniques are usually simplified when an irrigation and suction device is employed. However, within a low-resource setting a slow process of ""cup feeding"" is required and requires meticulous dexterity (Fig. 3). Unfortunately, during this demonstration a common complication of a loss of instrument occurred, but the subject was luckily successfully hydrated. CONCLUSION: While a lockdown remains in place, many gynecologists are not able to maintain their laparoscopic surgical skills. It is important to combine activities of daily living with minimal access training to maintain our physical and mental well-being. More research is clearly needed in the area of minimal access horticulture to expand this new and exciting subspecialty.","Ma, Kenneth",J. minim. invasive gynecol,188,16

A key component of COVID-19 control efforts is serological testing to determine the community prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 exposure and quantify individual immune responses to prior SARS-CoV-2 infection or vaccination. Here, we describe a laboratory-developed antibody test that uses readily available research-grade reagents to detect SARS-CoV-2 exposure in patient blood samples with high sensitivity and specificity. We further show that this sensitive test affords the estimation of viral spike-specific IgG titers from a single sample measurement, thereby providing a simple and scalable method to measure the strength of an individual's immune response. The accuracy, adaptability, and cost-effectiveness of this test make it an excellent option for clinical deployment in the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.IMPORTANCE Serological surveillance has become an important public health tool during the COVID-19 pandemic. Detection of protective antibodies and seroconversion after SARS-CoV-2 infection or vaccination can help guide patient care plans and public health policies. Serology tests can detect antibodies against past infections; consequently, they can help overcome the shortcomings of molecular tests, which can detect only active infections. This is important, especially when considering that many COVID-19 patients are asymptomatic. In this study, we describe an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)-based qualitative and quantitative serology test developed to measure IgG and IgA antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein. The test can be deployed using commonly available laboratory reagents and equipment and displays high specificity and sensitivity. Furthermore, we demonstrate that IgG titers in patient samples can be estimated from a single measurement, enabling the assay's use in high-throughput clinical environments.","Bortz, Robert H; Florez, Catalina; Laudermilch, Ethan; Wirchnianski, Ariel S; Lasso, Gorka; Malonis, Ryan J; Georgiev, George I; Vergnolle, Olivia; Herrera, Natalia G; Morano, Nicholas C; Campbell, Sean T; Orner, Erika P; Mengotto, Amanda; Dieterle, M Eugenia; Fels, J Maximilian; Haslwanter, Denise; Jangra, Rohit K; Celikgil, Alev; Kimmel, Duncan; Lee, James H; Mariano, Margarette C; Nakouzi, Antonio; Quiroz, Jose; Rivera, Johanna; Szymczak, Wendy A; Tong, Karen; Barnhill, Jason; Forsell, Mattias N E; Ahlm, Clas; Stein, Daniel T; Pirofski, Liise-Anne; Goldstein, D Yitzchak; Garforth, Scott J; Almo, Steven C; Daily, Johanna P; Prystowsky, Michael B; Faix, James D; Fox, Amy S; Weiss, Louis M; Lai, Jonathan R; Chandran, Kartik",MSphere,188,16

It is purported that socioeconomic factors may drive this association, but data supporting this assertion are sparse. Objectives: To evaluate whether socioeconomic factors mediate the association of race/ethnicity with COVID-19 incidence and outcomes. Methods: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of adults tested for (cohort 1) or hospitalized with (cohort 2) COVID-19 between March 1, 2020, and July 23, 2020, at the University of Miami Hospital and Clinics. Our primary exposure was race/ethnicity. We considered socioeconomic factors as potential mediators of our exposure's association with outcomes. We used standard statistics to describe our cohorts and multivariable regression modeling to identify associations of race/ethnicity with our primary outcomes, one for each cohort, of test positivity (cohort 1) and hospital mortality (cohort 2). We performed a mediation analysis to see whether household income, population density, and household size mediated the association of race/ethnicity with outcomes. Results: Our cohorts included 15,473 patients tested (29.0% non-Hispanic White, 48.1% Hispanic White, 15.0% non-Hispanic Black, 1.7% Hispanic Black, and 1.6% other) and 295 patients hospitalized (9.2% non-Hispanic White, 56.9% Hispanic White, 21.4% non-Hispanic Black, 2.4% Hispanic Black, and 10.2% other). Among those tested, 1,256 patients (8.1%) tested positive, and, of the hospitalized patients, 47 (15.9%) died. After adjustment for demographics, race/ethnicity was associated with test positivity-odds-ratio (95% confidence interval [CI]) versus non-Hispanic White for Non-Hispanic Black: 3.21 (2.60-3.96), Hispanic White: 2.72 (2.28-3.26), and Hispanic Black: 3.55 (2.33-5.28). Population density mediated this association (percentage mediated, 17%; 95% CI, 11-31%), as did median income (27%; 95% CI, 18-52%) and household size (20%; 95% CI, 12-45%). There was no association between race/ethnicity and mortality, although this analysis was underpowered. Conclusions: Black race and Hispanic ethnicity are associated with an increased odds of COVID-19 positivity. This association is substantially mediated by socioeconomic factors.","Gershengorn, Hayley B; Patel, Samira; Shukla, Bhavarth; Warde, Prem R; Bhatia, Monisha; Parekh, Dipen; Ferreira, Tanira",Ann Am Thorac Soc,188,16

TNF alpha reduces fluid absorption due to impairment of sodium and chloride transport required for building an osmotic gradient across epithelial cells, which in the airways maintains airway surface liquid helping to keep airways open and enabling bacterial clearance and aids water absorption from the alveolar spaces. TNF alpha can, through Rho-kinase, disintegrate the endothelial and epithelial cytoskeleton, and thus break up intercellular tight junctional proteins, breaching the intercellular barrier, which prevents flooding of the interstitial and alveolar spaces with fluid. Hypotheses: (1) Preservation and restoration of airway and alveolar epithelial sodium and chloride transport and the cytoskeleton dependent integrity of the cell barriers within the lung can prevent and treat COVID 19 lung disease. (2) TNF alpha is the key mediator of pulmonary edema in COVID 19 lung disease. Confirmation of hypothesis and implications: The role of a reduction in the function of epithelial sodium and chloride transport could with regards to chloride transport be tested by analysis of chloride levels in exhaled breath condensate and levels correlated with TNF alpha concentrations. Reduced levels would indicate a reduction of the function of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) chloride channel and a correlation with TNF alpha levels indicative of its involvement. Anti-TNF alpha treatment with antibodies is already available and needs to be tested in randomized controlled trials of COVID 19 lung disease. TNF alpha levels could also be reduced by statins, aspirin, and curcumin. Chloride transport could be facilitated by CFTR activators, including curcumin and phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors. Sodium and chloride transport could be further regulated to prevent accumulation of alveolar fluid by use of Na(+)/K(+)/2Cl(−) cotransporter type 1 inhibitors, which have been associated with improved outcome in adults ventilated for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in randomized controlled trials. Primary prevention of coronavirus infection and TNF alpha release in response to it could be improved by induction of antimicrobial peptides LL-37 and human beta defensin-2 and reduction of TNF alpha production by vitamin D prophylaxis for the population as a whole.","Eisenhut, Michael; Shin, Jae Il",Front.

In spite of clinical manifestations similar to the SARS-CoV epidemic in 2003, affected organs and severity are yet to be defined. Moreover, viral load alterations and viral shielding among different specimens remained scarce. Therefore, clarifying clinical presentations and correlations among viral loads, disease severity, and viral shielding of SARS-CoV-2 infection is crucial in the disease prevention. METHODS: The clinical courses of SARS-CoV-2 cases were presented through Gantt charts. Laboratory examinations and reverse-transcriptase quantitative polymerase chain reactions (RT-qPCR) among different specimens were tested periodically. Cycle thresholds (CT) were recorded and presented as viral loads. RESULTS: From March 2020 to April 2020, four SARS-CoV-2 cases were presented, of which, cases 1 and 2 manifested the symptoms severer than cases 3 and 4, along with higher serum lactate dehydrogenase levels and graded for lymphocytopenia. Case 4 initially exhibited anosmia, but recovered within a short period. Curves of the CT of all the cases, except case 2, concaved upward after prescribing hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and azithromycin. Except for case 4, the CT in most stool specimens remained undetectable; however, none of the cases presented gastrointestinal symptoms. Surprisingly, the CT values of the saliva specimens were inconsistent with those of the nasopharyngeal swabs and sputum. CONCLUSION: SARS-CoV-2 manifests various symptoms. Sudden onset of central nervous system symptoms should be considered. The timing of HCQ and azithromycin administration might be a key factor in the viral load reduction. Positive prediction values of RT-qPCR of different specimens should be tested carefully to prevent false-negative results.","Chen, Po-Liang; Hsiao, Yi-Han; Chuang, Chien; Feng, Jia-Yih; Ho, Hsiang-Ling; Lin, Yi-Tsung; Chen, Su-Jung; Huang, Shiang-Fen; Chen, Hsin-Pai; Chou, Teh-Ying; Chen, Yuh-Min; Wang, Fu-Der",J.

Many countries and airlines have implemented travel restrictions to limit the spread of the causative agent, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2. A common requirement has been a negative reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction performed by a clinical laboratory within 48 to 72 hours of departure. A more recent travel mandate for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 immunoglobulin M serology testing was instituted by the Chinese government on October 29, 2020. Pretravel testing for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 raises complications in terms of cost, turnaround time, and follow-up of positive results. In this report, we describe the experience of a multidisciplinary collaboration to develop a workflow for pretravel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction and immunoglobulin M serology testing at an academic medical center. The workflow primarily involved self-payment by patients and preferred retrieval of results by the patient through the electronic health record patient portal (Epic MyChart). A total of 556 unique patients underwent pretravel reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction testing, with 13 (2.4%) having one or more positive results, a rate similar to that for reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction testing performed for other protocol-driven asymptomatic screening (eg, inpatient admissions, preprocedural) at our medical center. For 5 of 13 reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction positive samples, the traveler had clinical history, prior reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction positive, and high cycle thresholds values on pretravel testing consistent with remote infection and minimal transmission risk. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 immunoglobulin M was performed on only 24 patients but resulted in 2 likely false positives.

Men with a large aneurysm >54 mm, either at first screen or during surveillance, are referred for intervention. The aim of the present study was to explore outcomes in these men and to see whether there was any regional variation in treatment rates and type of repair. METHODS: The study cohort included all men referred to a vascular network with a large abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). Basic demographic information, nurse assessment details, as well as outcome data were extracted from the national NAAASP IT system, AAA SMaRT, for analysis. RESULTS: Some 3 026 men were referred for possible intervention (48% first screen, 52% surveillance). Some 448 men (13.3%) either declined (63, 2.1%), or were turned down for early intervention for various reasons (385, 12.7%). Some 8% were declined for medical reasons (true turn down rate). Men referred from surveillance were older, and more likely not to have had elective surgery within three months (16.0 vs. 11.2%; HR 1.37, 95% CI 1.07-1.75, p = .011). Turn down rates did not vary among local programmes, when surveillance men were taken into account. Some 2 624 (87%) men had planned AAA repair, with a peri-operative mortality of 1.3%. Thirty day surgical mortality was lower after EVAR: 0.4% compared with 2.1% after open repair. The method of repair remained consistent year on year, with roughly equal numbers undergoing endovascular (50%) and open surgical repair (48%); 2% unknown. There was regional variation in the proportion treated by endovascular repair: from 20% to 97%. CONCLUSION: The turn down rate after referral for treatment with a screen detected AAA was low, but there remains considerable regional variation in the proportion undergoing endovascular repair. Procedures were undertaken with low peri-operative mortality.","Meecham, Lewis; Jacomelli, Jo; Davis, Meryl; Pherwani, Arun; Lees, Tim; Earnshaw, Jonothan J",Eur J Vasc Endovasc Surg,188,20

Objective: To assess the effect of antimicrobial therapy on clinical outcomes. Design, Setting, and Participants: Pragmatic, randomized, unblinded clinical trial conducted across 35 US sites. A total of 513 patients older than 40 years were randomized from August 2017 to June 2019 (final follow-up was January 2020). Interventions: Patients were randomized in a 1:1 allocation ratio to receive antimicrobials (n = 254) or usual care alone (n = 259). Antimicrobials included co-trimoxazole (trimethoprim 160 mg/sulfamethoxazole 800 mg twice daily plus folic acid 5 mg daily, n = 128) or doxycycline (100 mg once daily if body weight <50 kg or 100 mg twice daily if &#8805;50 kg, n = 126). No placebo was administered in the usual care alone group. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary end point was time to first nonelective respiratory hospitalization or all-cause mortality. Results: Among the 513 patients who were randomized (mean age, 71 years; 23.6% women), all (100%) were included in the analysis. The study was terminated for futility on December 18, 2019. After a mean follow-up time of 13.1 months (median, 12.7 months), a total of 108 primary end point events occurred: 52 events (20.4 events per 100 patient-years [95% CI, 14.8-25.9]) in the usual care plus antimicrobial therapy group and 56 events (18.4 events per 100 patient-years [95% CI, 13.2-23.6]) in the usual care group, with no significant difference between groups (adjusted HR, 1.04 [95% CI, 0.71-1.53; P = .83]. There was no statistically significant interaction between the effect of the prespecified antimicrobial agent (co-trimoxazole vs doxycycline) on the primary end point (adjusted HR, 1.15 [95% CI 0.68-1.95] in the co-trimoxazole group vs 0.82 [95% CI, 0.46-1.47] in the doxycycline group; P = .66). Serious adverse events occurring at 5% or greater among those treated with usual care plus antimicrobials vs usual care alone included respiratory events (16.5% vs 10.0%) and infections (2.8% vs 6.6%); adverse events of special interest included diarrhea (10.2% vs 3.1%) and rash (6.7% vs 0%). Conclusions and Relevance: Among adults with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, the addition of co-trimoxazole or doxycycline to usual care, compared with usual care alone, did not significantly improve time to nonelective respiratory hospitalization or death.

This study aimed to analyze the mortality risk factors of diabetic patients with COVID-19. A total of 167 patients with severe COVID-19, including 55 diabetic patients and 112 nondiabetic patients at Tongji Hospital, Wuhan, China from January 28, 2020, to March 10, 2020, were collected. The laboratory, radiological, management information, and medical history was retrospectively reviewed. Potential mortality risk factors in diabetic patients with COVID-19 were evaluated by the proportional hazard Cox model. The clinical information of 167 patients with severe COVID-19 was analyzed. The median age was 65.0 years. Approximately 32.9% of patients had diabetes. In total patients, older age, diabetes, and lymphocyte count were associated with increased risk of death. In diabetic patients, increased mortality was associated with decreased lymphocyte count (&#8804;0.45×109/L, HR 0.196, 95% CI 0.049-0.781, P = 0.021), lactate dehydrogenase >600 U/L (HR 8.010, 95% CI 1.540-41.670, P = 0.013), hsCRP >90 mg/L (HR 4.551, 95% CI 1.472-14.070, P = 0.009) and interleukin-10 >10 U/mL (HR 5.362, 95% CI 1.239-23.199, P = 0.025). COVID-19 patients with diabetes had a poor prognosis, especially when they had two or more of the following abnormalities (&#967;2 = 58.62, P<0.001): lymphocyte count was &#8804;0.45×109/L, lactate dehydrogenase was >600 U/L, hsCRP was >90 mg/L and IL-10 was >10 U/mL.

Healthcare workers (HCWs) are at increased risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection, experiencing a significant burden from COVID-19. Identifying and understanding the clinical characteristics and risk factors associated with infection are of paramount importance to inform screening strategies and infection control practices in this scenario. The aims of this study were to investigate the prevalence and clinical characteristics of HCWs with COVID-19 symptoms. METHODS: Between March 21st and May 22nd, 2020 a cross-sectional study was performed in a tertiary university hospital in São Paulo. Prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection among HCWs with COVID-19 symptoms was determined by RT-PCR testing on nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal samples. Participants were asked to complete an electronic structured questionnaire including clinical and demographic data. RESULTS: Overall, 125 (42.37%) of 295 symptomatic HCWs tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Over the 10-week study period, positivity rates varied from 22.2% (95% CI 15.9-60.3%) in the second week to 55.9% (95% CI 43.2-68.6%) in the sixth week, reaching a plateau (38-46%) thereafter. Median (SD) age was 34.2 (9.9) years and 205 (69.5%) were female. We did not find significant differences in the prevalence of the most commonly reported underlying medical condition among healthcare workers that tested positive or negative for SARS-CoV-2 infection. After multivariable analysis, using logistic regression, anosmia (adjusted OR 4.4 95% CI 2.21-8.74) and ocular pain (adjusted OR 1.95 95% CI 1.14-3.33) were the only symptoms independently associated with positivity for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Follow-up information on clinical outcomes showed that 9 (7.2%) HCWs were hospitalized (seven were male) and 2 (1.6%) died. CONCLUSIONS: The findings of this study confirmed the high burden of SARS-CoV-2 infection among healthcare workers in the hardest hit city by the pandemic in Latin America. Anosmia and ocular pain were symptoms independently associated with COVID-19 diagnosis. In low and middle-income countries, where limited availability of tests is frequent, these findings may contribute to optimize a targeted symptom-oriented screening strategy.","Buonafine, Carolina Palamin; Paiatto, Beatriz Nobre Monteiro; Leal, Fabyano Bruno; de Matos, Samantha Faria; de Morais, Camila Ohomoto; Guerra, Giovanna Guazzelli; Martuchelli, Marcus Vinicius Vidal; Oliveira, Danielle Bruna Leal; Durigon, Edison Luiz; Soares, Camila Pereira; Candido, Erika Donizette; Telezynski, Bruna Larotonda; Sáfadi, Marco Aurélio Palazzi; Almeida, Flávia Jacqueline",BMC Infect Dis,188,1

508506,508506,508506,Offline: Remembering the scientists,14.403814,6.0393944,2020,"Bats host many viruses pathogenic to humans, and increasing evidence suggests that rotavirus A (RVA) also belongs to this list. Rotaviruses cause diarrheal disease in many mammals and birds, and their segmented genomes allow them to reassort and increase their genetic diversity. Eighteen out of 2,142 bat fecal samples (0.8%) collected from Europe, Central America, and Africa were PCR-positive for RVA, and 11 of those were fully characterized using viral metagenomics. Upon contrasting their genomes with publicly available data, at least 7 distinct bat RVA genotype constellations (GCs) were identified, which included evidence of reassortments and 6 novel genotypes. Some of these constellations are spread across the world, whereas others appear to be geographically restricted. Our analyses also suggest that several unusual human and equine RVA strains might be of bat RVA origin, based on their phylogenetic clustering, despite various levels of nucleotide sequence identities between them. Although SA11 is one of the most widely used reference strains for RVA research and forms the backbone of a reverse genetics system, its origin remained enigmatic. Remarkably, the majority of the genotypes of SA11-like strains were shared with Gabonese bat RVAs, suggesting a potential common origin. Overall, our findings suggest an underexplored genetic diversity of RVAs in bats, which is likely only the tip of the iceberg. Increasing contact between humans and bat wildlife will further increase the zoonosis risk, which warrants closer attention to these viruses.IMPORTANCE The increased research on bat coronaviruses after severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) allowed the very rapid identification of SARS-CoV-2. This is an excellent example of the importance of knowing viruses harbored by wildlife in general, and bats in particular, for global preparedness against emerging viral pathogens. The current effort to characterize bat rotavirus strains from 3 continents sheds light on the vast genetic diversity of rotaviruses and also hints at a bat origin for several atypical rotaviruses in humans and animals, implying that zoonoses of bat rotaviruses might occur more frequently than currently realized.","Simsek, Ceren; Corman, Victor Max; Everling, Hermann Ulrich; Lukashev, Alexander N; Rasche, Andrea; Maganga, Gael Darren; Binger, Tabea; Jansen, Daan; Beller, Leen; Deboutte, Ward; Gloza-Rausch, Florian; Seebens-Hoyer, Antje; Yordanov, Stoian; Sylverken, Augustina; Oppong, Samuel; Sarkodie, Yaw Adu; Vallo, Peter; Leroy, Eric M; Bourgarel, Mathieu; Yinda, Kwe Claude; Van Ranst, Marc; Drosten, Christian; Drexler, Jan Felix; Matthijnssens, Jelle",mBio (Online),188,20

Whereas case counts in the entire region remain considerably less than those being reported by individual countries in Europe, Asia, and the Americas, variation in preparedness and response capacity as well as in data availability has raised concerns about undetected transmission events in the SSA region. To capture epidemiological details related to early transmission events into and within countries, a line list was developed from publicly available data on institutional websites, situation reports, press releases, and social media accounts. The availability of indicators-gender, age, travel history, date of arrival in country, reporting date of confirmation, and how detected-for each imported case was assessed. We evaluated the relationship between the time to first reported importation and the Global Health Security Index (GHSI) overall score; 13,201 confirmed cases of COVID-19 were reported by 48 countries in SSA during the 54 days following the first known introduction to the region. Of the 2,516 cases for which travel history information was publicly available, 1,129 (44.9%) were considered importation events. Imported cases tended to be male (65.0%), with a median age of 41.0 years (range: 6 weeks-88 years; IQR: 31-54 years). A country's time to report its first importation was not related to the GHSI overall score, after controlling for air traffic.

Likewise, home visits by general practitioners (GPs) become rarer. If a nursing home resident develops acute symptoms, nurses are often inclined to call the rescue service. Besides patient-related consequences, this might lead to unnecessary hospitalization and far-reaching health economic costs. Due to legal restrictions of remote treatment in Germany, which were recently loosened, telemedicine is still in the early stages. The aim of this study was to employ a holistic telemedical system for nursing homes which facilitates the connection to a GP and thus avoids unnecessary hospitalizations in the case of ambulatory-sensitive illnesses. Materials and Methods: After an inter-professional requirement analysis, the iterative development was started. In addition to an audio-video connection, several point of care measurements were integrated. Finally, first field tests were performed in a nursing home in a rural area in Germany. Results: One nursing home was equipped with telemedical system based on the results of the requirement analysis and tele-medically connected to a GP. Over a period of seven months, 56 routine and emergency teleconsultations took place. Only one of those required a hospital admission. In addition to video telephony, electrocardiography and assessment of vitals such as pulse, blood pressure, oxygen saturation and auscultation of heart and lungs were applied frequently. Conclusion: A telemedical system including integrated medical devices was successfully developed and has turned out to be helpful and even necessary for careful and reliable decision-making by the GP. First test results show high acceptance for elderly care. Involved patients, nurses, and the GP itemize various specific benefits, including economic, personal, and altruistic issues. Another issue that the current COVID-19 crisis brought to light is lowering the risk of contagion; GPs can replace their home visits by using telepresence combined with point of care measures.","Ohligs, Marian; Stocklassa, Stephanie; Rossaint, Rolf; Czaplik, Michael; Follmann, Andreas",Clin Interv Aging,188,22

However, the use of REEs in wastewater treatment could mean increased human exposure to lanthanides (Ln) through wastewater effluent discharge to the environment or through water reuse. Information on the toxicity of lanthanides is scarce and, where available, there are conflicting views. Using in vitro bioassays, we assessed lanthanide toxicity by evaluating four relevant endpoints: the change in mitochondrial membrane potential (&#916;&#968;m), intracellular adenosine triphosphate (I-ATP), genotoxicity, and cell viability. At less than 5000 µmol-Ln3+/L, lanthanides increased the &#916;&#968;m, while above 5000 µmol-Ln3+/L, the &#916;&#968;m level plummeted. The measure of I-ATP indicated constant levels of ATP up to 250 µmol-Ln3+/L, above which the I-ATP decreased steadily; the concentration of La, Ce, Gd, and Lu that triggered half of the cells to become ATP-inactive is 794, 1505, 1488, 1115 µmol-Ln3+/L, respectively. Although La and Lu accelerated cell death in shorter studies (24 h), chronic studies using three cell growth cycles showed cell recovery. Lanthanides exhibited antagonistic toxicity at less than 1000 µmol-Ln3+/L. However, the introduction of heavy REEs in a solution amplified lanthanide toxicity.

Here, we report a fragment molecular orbital (FMO) based interaction analysis on a complex between the SARS-CoV-2 main protease (Mpro) and its peptide-like inhibitor N3 (PDB ID: 6LU7). The target inhibitor molecule was segmented into five fragments in order to capture site specific interactions with amino acid residues of the protease. The interaction energies were decomposed into several contributions, and then the characteristics of hydrogen bonding and dispersion stabilization were made clear. Furthermore, the hydration effect was incorporated by the Poisson-Boltzmann (PB) scheme. From the present FMO study, His41, His163, His164, and Glu166 were found to be the most important amino acid residues of Mpro in interacting with the inhibitor, mainly due to hydrogen bonding. A guideline for optimizations of the inhibitor molecule was suggested as well based on the FMO analysis.","Hatada, Ryo; Okuwaki, Koji; Mochizuki, Yuji; Handa, Yuma; Fukuzawa, Kaori; Komeiji, Yuto; Okiyama, Yoshio; Tanaka, Shigenori",J Chem Inf Model,188,1

The antibody response in infected patient remains largely unknown, and the clinical values of antibody testing have not been fully demonstrated. METHODS: A total of 173 patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection were enrolled. Their serial plasma samples (n=535) collected during the hospitalization were tested for total antibodies (Ab), IgM and IgG against SARS-CoV-2. The dynamics of antibodies with the disease progress was analyzed. RESULTS: Among 173 patients, the seroconversion rate for Ab, IgM and IgG was 93.1%, 82.7% and 64.7%, respectively. The reason for the negative antibody findings in 12 patients might due to the lack of blood samples at the later stage of illness. The median seroconversion time for Ab, IgM and then IgG were day-11, day-12 and day-14, separately. The presence of antibodies was <40% among patients within 1-week since onset, and rapidly increased to 100.0% (Ab), 94.3% (IgM) and 79.8% (IgG) since day-15 after onset. In contrast, RNA detectability decreased from 66.7% (58/87) in samples collected before day-7 to 45.5% (25/55) during day 15-39. Combining RNA and antibody detections significantly improved the sensitivity of pathogenic diagnosis for COVID-19 (p<0.001), even in early phase of 1-week since onset (p=0.007). Moreover, a higher titer of Ab was independently associated with a worse clinical classification (p=0.006). CONCLUSIONS: The antibody detection offers vital clinical information during the course of SARS-CoV-2 infection.

METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the number and the findings of FDG-PET/CT studies acquired between February and April 2020 during the Covid-19 pandemic at the University of Napoli Federico II. The number and the findings of FDG-PET/CT studies acquired in the corresponding period of 2019 were also assessed for direct comparison. RESULTS: The number of FDG-PET/CT studies performed during the pandemic (n = 299) and in the corresponding period of 2019 (n = 335) were comparable. The percentage of abnormal FDG-PET/CT findings, suspicious for interstitial pneumonia by Covid-19 infection, was significantly higher during the pandemic (9%) compared with that found in the corresponding period of 2019 (4%) (&#967;2 5.45, P = 0.02). No significant differences were observed in the distribution of Covid-19 reporting and data system (CO-RADS) classification and in the maximum standardized uptake value between the pandemic (2.6 ± 2.2) and the corresponding period of 2019 (3.2 ± 1.4). Of note, patients with abnormal imaging findings during the pandemic time had clinical data and/or laboratory tests negative for Covid-19 infection.

DESIGN: Cross-sectional survey. SETTING: The Ottawa Hospital, Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. PARTICIPANTS: Patients who gave birth at The Ottawa Hospital and were >20 days post partum between 17 March and 16 June 2020. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Perinatal IPV was defined as regular controlling behaviours or act-based forms of emotional/physical/sexual abuse in the 12 months before pregnancy, during pregnancy and/or post partum. Log-binomial multivariable regression models were used to compute adjusted risk ratios (aRRs) and 95% CIs to identify potential risk factors for IPV: maternal age, postpartum depression, parity, increase in partner substance use and household income. RESULTS: Among 216 participants, the median maternal age was 33 years (IQR: 30-36). In total, 52 (24.07%) reported some form of perinatal IPV, 37 (17.13%) reported regular controlling behaviour and 9 (4.17%) reported both. Household income below the municipal median was the strongest risk factor for perinatal IPV (aRR: 3.24, 95% CI: 1.87 to 5.59). There was no apparent association between maternal age (aRR: 0.99, 95% CI: 0.94 to 1.04), postpartum depression (aRR: 1.03, 95% CI: 1.00 to 1.07), nulliparity (aRR: 1.18, 95% CI: 0.71 to 1.97) or increases in partner substance use (aRR: 0.73, 95% CI: 0.42 to 1.25) with IPV. CONCLUSION: One in four individuals in this study experienced perinatal IPV. Household income was the strongest risk factor, and surprisingly, many hypothesised risk factors (eg, mental health, partner substance use, etc) were not significantly associated with perinatal IPV in this sample. This highlights the challenges in both measuring IPV and identifying individuals exposed to perinatal IPV during the high stress of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Muldoon, Katherine A; Denize, Kathryn M; Talarico, Robert; Boisvert, Carlie; Frank, Olivia; Harvey, Alysha L J; Rennicks White, Ruth; Fell, Deshayne B; O039,; Hare-Gordon, Meagan Ann; Guo, Yanfang; Murphy, Malia S Q; Corsi, Daniel J; Sampsel, Kari; Wen, Shi Wu; Walker, Mark C; El-Chaar, Darine",BMJ Open,188,1

523434,523434,523434,Editorial Reflections,14.612832,6.1648703,2020,"IntroductionPatients suffering from primary or secondary immunodeficiency (PID or SID) face times of increased insecurity and discomfort in the light of the raging COVID-19 pandemic, not knowing if and to what extent their comorbidities impact the course of a potential SARS-CoV-2 infection. Furthermore, recently available vaccination options might not be amenable or effective for all patients of this heterogeneous population. Therefore, these patients often rely on passive immunization with plasma-derived, intravenous or subcutaneous immunoglobulin (IVIG/SCIG). Whether the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and/or the progress in vaccination programs lead to increased and potentially protective titers in plasma-derived immunoglobulins (Ig) indicated, e.g., for humoral immunodeficiency remains a pressing question for this patient population. PurposeWe investigated SARS-CoV-2 reactivity of US plasma-derived IVIG/SCIG products from the end of 2020 until 06/2021 as well as in convalescent plasma (CP) from 05/2020 to 08/2020 to determine whether potentially neutralizing antibody titers may be present. MethodsFinal containers of IVIG/SCIG and CP donations were analyzed by commercial ELISA for anti-SARS-CoV-2 S1-receptor binding domain (RBD) IgG as well as microneutralization assay using a patient-derived SARS-CoV-2 (D614G) isolate. Neutralization capacities of 313 plasma single donations and 119 plasma-derived IVIG/SCIG lots were determined. Results obtained from both analytical methods were normalized against the WHO International Standard. Finally, based on dense pharmacokinetic (PK) profiles of an IVIG preparation from previously published investigations, possible steady-state plasma levels of SARS-CoV-2 neutralization capacities were approximated based on currently measured anti-SARS-CoV-2 potencies in IVIG/SCIG preparations. ResultsCP donations presented with a high variability with regards to anti-SARS-CoV-2 reactivity in ELISA as well as in neutralization testing. While approximately 50% of convalescent donations were none/low neutralizing, approximately 10% were at or above 1000 IU/mL. IVIG/SCIG lots derived from pre-pandemic plasma donations did not show neutralizing capacities of SARS-CoV-2. Lots produced between 12/2020 and 06/2021, entailing plasma donations after the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 showed a rapid and constant increase in anti-SARS-CoV-2 reactivity and neutralization capacity over time. While lot-to-lot variability was substantial, neutralization capacity increased from a mean of 20 IU/mL in 12/2020 to 505 IU/mL in 06/2021 with a maximum of 864 IU/mL for the most recent lots. Pharmacokinetic extrapolations, based on non-compartmental superposition principles using steady-state reference profiles from previously published PK investigations on IVIG in PID, yielded potential steady-state trough plasma levels of 16 IU/mL of neutralizing SARS-CoV-2 IgG based on the average final container concentration from 05/2021 of 216 IU/mL. Maximum extrapolated trough levels could reach 64 IU/mL based on the latest maximal final container potency tested in 06/2021. ConclusionsSARS-CoV-2 reactivity and neutralization capacity in IVIG/SCIG produced from US plasma rapidly and in part exponentially increased in the first half of 2021. The observed increase of final container potencies is likely trailing the serological status of the US donor population in terms of COVID-19 convalescence and vaccination by at least 5 months due to production lead times and should in principle continue at least until fall 2021. In summary, the data support rapidly increasing levels of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in IVIG/SCIG products implicating that a certain level of protection could be possible against COVID-19 for regularly substituted PID/SID patients. Nevertheless, more research is still needed to confirm which plasma levels are needed to provide protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection in immune-compromised patients. Plain Language SummaryPeople with deficiencies in their immune system often have an insufficient antibody response to antigens, e.g., bacteria, viruses, or vaccines. These patients therefore often receive antibodies from healthy people to replace the missing antibodies and build a first line of defense against infections. These antibodies (also called immunoglobulins (Ig)) are prepared from plasma of healthy donors, the liquid fraction of the blood without cells. This plasma is then split up in pharmaceutical production into its protein components. One of these is immunoglobulin G (IgG), which is the protein family that neutralizes/inactivates infectious agents as well as marks these infectious agents so they can be recognized by other parts of the immune system. With the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and the severe to fatal outcomes for certain patient groups, especially people with impaired immunity, these patients and their physicians are interested in whether their antibody replacement therapy also confers protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection. We analyzed the capability of plasma-derived Ig lots to (i) recognize SARS-CoV-2 protein by ELISA method as well as (ii) neutralize SARS-CoV-2 by neutralization studies using the actual virus under biosafety level 3 (BSL-3) conditions. Here we show increasing anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity over time of manufactured Ig lots produced between 12/2020 and 06/2021. The most recent lots had a neutralizing activity of up to 864 IU/mL. Considering that the USA represents Octapharmas main plasma source, the progress in vaccination levels together with the evolution of the COVID-19 pandemic in this country suggests that the IVIG/SCIG neutralization capacities against SARS-CoV-2 might still increase and could potentially meet a level where antibody plasma concentrations in the patient confer immune protection. Key PointsO_LIPatients with humoral immunodeficiency rely on plasma-derived immunoglobulin for passive immunization against numerous pathogens. C_LIO_LISARS-CoV-2 neutralization capacities of plasma-derived immunoglobulins have increased over time with the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and vaccination campaigns. C_LIO_LIPlasma-derived immunoglobulin in prophylactic use for immunodeficient patients could potentially protect against SARS-CoV-2 infection in the future.

One particularly relevant decision-making phenomenon is the prominence effect, where decision-makers base their decisions on the most prominent attribute of the object at hand (e.g., health concerns) rather than weigh all the attributes together. This bias diminishes when the decision-making mode inhibits heuristic processes. In this study, we tested the prominence of health vs. financial concerns across two decision-making modes - choice (prone to heuristics) and matching (mitigates heuristics) - during the peak of the COVID-19 in the UK using Tversky et al.'s classic experimental paradigm. We added to the classic experimental design a priming condition. Participants were presented with two casualty-minimization programs, differing in lives saved and costs: program X would save 100 lives at the cost of 55-million-pound sterling, whereas program Y would save 30 lives at the cost of 12-million-pound sterling. Half of the participants were required to choose between the programs (choice condition). The other half were not given the cost of program X and were asked to determine what the cost should be to make it as equally attractive as the program Y. Participants in both groups were primed for either: a) financial concerns;b) health concerns;or c) control (no priming). Results showed that in the choice condition, unless primed for financial concerns, health concerns are more prominent. In the matching condition, on the other hand, the prominence of health concerns did not affect decision-makers, as they all 'preferred' the cheaper option. These results add further support to the practical relevance of using the proper decision-making modes in times of consequential crises where multiple concerns, interests, and parties are involved. © 2021 Maaravi Y and Heller B.","Maaravi, Y.; Heller, B.",,188,30

In addition, the numbers of diabetics are rising, along with its most common complication, diabetic retinopathy (DR). To effectively treat DR within the elderly population, it is essential first to consider the retinal changes that occur due to aging, such as decreased blood flow, retinal thinning, and microglial changes, and understand that these changes can render the retina more vulnerable to oxidative and ischemic damage. Given these considerations, as well as the pathogenesis of DR, specific pathways could play a heightened role in DR progression in elderly patients, such as the polyol pathway and the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) axis. Current ocular treatments include intravitreal corticosteroids, intravitreal anti-VEGF agents, laser photocoagulation and surgical interventions, in addition to better control of underlying diabetes with an expanding range of systemic treatments. While using therapeutics, it is also essential to consider how pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics change with aging; oral drug absorption can decrease, and ocular drug metabolism might affect the dosing and delivery methods. Also, elderly patients may more likely be nonadherent to their medication regimen or appointments than younger patients, and undertreatment with anti-VEGF drugs often leads to suboptimal outcomes. With a rising number of elderly DR patients, understanding how aging affects disease progression, pharmacological metabolism, and adherence are crucial to ensuring that this population receives adequate care.","Leley, Sameer P; Ciulla, Thomas A; Bhatwadekar, Ashay D",Clin Interv Aging,188,16

METHODS: In this open, uncontrolled pilot study, the efficacy and safety of the gel during a treatment period of 12 weeks (daily 1×1 mL) were evaluated (n=28). The gel is made of water and hypromellose, a hydropropylmetyl cellulose, which works by coating the vagina, and was developed to treat moderate–severe symptoms of VVA. The primary efficacy variable was the most bothersome symptom (MBS; among vulvovaginal irritation and itching, vaginal dryness, dysuria, or dyspareunia) self-identified at baseline on a four-point scale. RESULTS: A total of 28 patients fulfilled all entry criteria and had data available after the start of treatment. Treatment with the gel reduced MBS scores from baseline (n=28, mean 2.71) to week 12 (n=27, mean 1.33, mean reduction 1.37; p=0), and reduced the overall total scores for VVA symptoms from a mean of 5.39 at baseline to 2.25 at week 12 (p=0). Eleven subjects (39%) reported 19 AEs. CONCLUSION: A 12-week treatment with the gel significantly reduced the severity of MBSs and VVA symptoms, improved quality of life, and was safe to use in women with breast cancer undergoing adjuvant aromatase-inhibitor therapy. In view of the beneficial effects of nonhormonal treatments, for cancer patients in particular, the water-based cellulose gel VagiVital is a suitable candidate for first-choice treatment of VVA symptoms in breast cancer patients and in women predisposed to cancer.","Jonasson, Aino Fianu; Åstrom, Mikael",Med Devices (Auckl),188,16

METHODS: One hundred and fifty-eight patients with glioma WHO grade II–IV were included. Plasma collected at surgery was screened for 92 proteins using proximity extension assay technology and related to clinical outcome. Secretion and expression of candidate prognostic biomarkers were subsequently analyzed in 8 GBM cell lines and public RNAseq data. RESULTS: Plasma levels of 20 out of 92 screened proteins were significantly different in patients with GBM compared to patients with astrocytoma WHO grade II–III. High plasma interleukin-8 (IL-8) (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.52; P = .0077) and low CD244 (HR = 0.36; P = .0004) were associated with short progression-free survival and high plasma IL-8 (HR = 1.40; P = .044) and low ICOS ligand (ICOSLG) (HR = 0.17; P = .0003) were associated with short overall survival (OS) in newly diagnosed patients with GBM.

IL-8 was mostly secreted and expressed by mesenchymal GBM cell lines and expressed by vascular cells and immune cells in the TME. This was also the case for ICOSLG, although less consistent, and with additional expression in tumor-associated oligodendrocytes. CONCLUSIONS: High plasma IL-8 and low ICOSLG at surgery are associated with short OS in newly diagnosed GBM. Source of plasma ICOSLG may be found outside the TME.","Holst, Camilla Bjørnbak; Christensen, Ib Jarle; Vitting-Seerup, Kristoffer; Skjøth-Rasmussen, Jane; Hamerlik, Petra; Poulsen, Hans Skovgaard; Johansen, Julia Sidenius",Neurooncol Adv,188,9

A skilled and competent postgraduate resident is critical to the country’s health needs and is more relevant in the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. The postgraduate medical training in India is speciality-specific and based on a structured curriculum and syllabus to achieve precise educational goals and objectives. The impact of this pandemic on postgraduate medical education and training is controversial, challenging, unknown, and far-reaching. The exceptional contagious nature of the virus and country-wide lockdowns have tremendously decreased hospital visiting patients. Abolition of outpatient and inpatient services, disruptions in clinical postings, curtailment of elective operations and procedures have adversely affected the training of residents and fellowship students in India and abroad. Apart from this, research work, mentoring, academic conferences, and workshops that offer learning experiences to these residents have been cancelled or suspended, thus denying them a chance to achieve domain knowledge and enhance their skills. Although this pandemic has offered new learning modes like teleconsultation, videoconferencing, virtual simulations, digital podcasts, etc., how much actual knowledge transfer and skill gain will be achieved is unanswered. Despite this disruption, this pandemic has offered a golden opportunity to relook at the current PG resident education and training programme. The lessons learned from this adversity offer medical universities, medical educators, and regulatory authorities many opportunities to develop a novel and innovative curriculum that enables the current and future residents to achieve the necessary proficiency and competency.","Patil, Amit; Ranjan, Ranvir; Kumar, Prabhat; Narang, Himanshi",Adv Med Educ Pract,188,20

Dysregulation of ADP-ribosylation is implicated in cancer, neurodegeneration, and viral infection. We developed ADPriboDB (adpribodb.leunglab.org) to facilitate studies in uncovering insights into the mechanisms and biological significance of ADP-ribosylation. ADPriboDB 2.0 serves as a one-stop repository comprising 48,346 entries and 9,097 ADP-ribosylated proteins, of which 6,708 were newly identified since the original database release. In this updated version, we provide information regarding the sites of ADP-ribosylation in 32,946 entries. The wealth of information allows us to interrogate existing databases or newly available data. For example, we found that ADP-ribosylated substrates are significantly associated with the recently identified human protein interaction networks associated with SARS-CoV-2, which encodes a conserved protein domain called macrodomain that binds and removes ADP-ribosylation. In addition, we create a new interactive tool to visualize the local context of ADP-ribosylation, such as structural and functional features as well as other post-translational modifications (e.g., phosphorylation, methylation and ubiquitination). This information provides opportunities to explore the biology of ADP-ribosylation and generate new hypotheses for experimental testing.","Ayyappan, Vinay; Wat, Ricky; Barber, Calvin; Vivelo, Christina A.; Gauch, Kathryn; Visanpattanasin, Pat; Cook, Garth; Sazeides, Christos; Leung, Anthony K.

The experimental groups were: G1= RVA-specific IgY treatment; G2= no Ab treatment; and G3= colostrum deprived + no Ab treatment. IgY treatment significantly reduced virus shedding, diarrhea duration and severity compared to G2 and G3 calves. However, it caused a partial suppression of systemic Ab responses to RVA that could be associated with less severe diarrhea. The oral treatment with IgY for 7 days was associated with significantly higher antibody secreting cell responses in the calves compared with the other groups of animals.","Vega, C.; Bok, M.; Saif, L.; Fernandez, F.; Parreño, V.",Research in Veterinary Science,188,24

In these low-income countries, most patients with acute respiratory infection (ARI), whether it is mild or severe, are still treated empirically. The aim of the study was to evaluate the risk factors associated with the evolution and outcome of respiratory illnesses in patients aged under 5 years old. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted a prospective study in a paediatric ward in Antananarivo from November 2010 to July 2012 including patients under 5 years old suffering from respiratory infections. We collected demographic, socio-economic, clinical and epidemiological data, and samples for laboratory analysis. Deaths, rapid progression to respiratory distress during hospitalisation, and hospitalisation for more than 10 days were considered as severe outcomes. We used multivariate analysis to study the effects of co-infections. RESULTS: From November 2010 to July 2012, a total of 290 patients were enrolled. Co-infection was found in 192 patients (70%). Co-infections were more frequent in children under 36 months, with a significant difference for the 19–24 month-old group (OR: 8.0). Sixty-nine percent (230/290) of the patients recovered fully and without any severe outcome during hospitalisation; the outcome was scored as severe for 60 children and nine patients (3%) died. Risk factors significantly associated with worsening evolution during hospitalisation (severe outcome) were admission at age under 6 months (OR = 5.3), comorbidity (OR = 4.6) and low household income (OR = 4.1). CONCLUSION: Co-mordidity, low-income and age under 6 months increase the risk of severe outcome for children infected by numerous respiratory pathogens. These results highlight the need for implementation of targeted public health policy to reduce the contribution of respiratory diseases to childhood morbidity and mortality in low income countries.","Rajatonirina, Soatiana; Razanajatovo, Norosoa Harline; Ratsima, Elisoa Hariniana; Orelle, Arnaud; Ratovoson, Rila; Andrianirina, Zo Zafitsara; Andriatahina, Todisoa; Ramparany, Lovasoa; Herindrainy, Perlinot; Randrianirina, Frédérique; Heraud, Jean-Michel; Richard, Vincent",PLoS One,188,16

Analyzing vaccination data from 19 April 2021, when nearly half of the US adult population was at least partially vaccinated, we find associations between racial disparities in COVID-19 vaccination and median income (negative), disparity in high school education (positive), and vote share for the Republican party in the 2020 presidential election (negative), while vaccine hesitancy is not related to disparities. We examine differences in associations for COVID-19 vaccine uptake as compared with influenza vaccine.

However, their charged nature carries the risk of increased cytotoxicity and interaction with serum proteins, limiting their potential in vivo application. Therefore, hydrophilic or anionic shielding polymers are applied to counteract these effects. Herein, a series of micelle-forming and micelle-shielding polymers were synthesized via RAFT polymerization. The copolymer poly[(n-butyl acrylate)-b-(2-(dimethyl amino)ethyl acrylamide)] (P(nBA-b-DMAEAm)) was assembled into cationic micelles and different shielding polymers were applied, i.e., poly(acrylic acid) (PAA), poly(4-acryloyl morpholine) (PNAM) or P(NAM-b-AA) block copolymer. These systems were compared to a triblock terpolymer micelle comprising PAA as the middle block. The assemblies were investigated regarding their morphology, interaction with pDNA, cytotoxicity, transfection efficiency, polyplex uptake and endosomal escape. The naked cationic micelle exhibited superior transfection efficiency, but increased cytotoxicity. The addition of shielding polymers led to reduced toxicity. In particular, the triblock terpolymer micelle convinced with high cell viability and no significant loss in efficiency. The highest shielding effect was achieved by layering micelles with P(NAM-b-AA) supporting the colloidal stability at neutral zeta potential and completely restoring cell viability while maintaining moderate transfection efficiencies. The high potential of this micelle-layer-combination for gene delivery was illustrated for the first time.

This study aimed to assess the confidence and its predictors in HMPX case management among general practitioners (GPs), the frontline doctors in Indonesia, and to explore their perspectives on HMPX. Between May and July 2019, GPs in Indonesia completed an online-based survey. The questionnaire collected information on GPs’ confidence, perspective, sociodemographic, workplace and professional characteristics, exposure to HMPX information and knowledge on HMPX. A logistic regression analysis was employed to explore the explanatory variables influencing the confidence and the perspective. We included 395 GPs in our analysis (77.4% out of 510 responses received) of which 10.1% and 34.9% were classified having good confidence using an 80% and 70% cut-off for confidence score, respectively. In the adjusted analysis, receiving information about HMPX during medical training was the only variable significantly associated with good confidence (adjusted odds ratio 2.74, 95% confidence interval 1.57 to 4.78 and p < 0.001).

In addition, 88.8% of GPs suggested that the disease should be incorporated into the National Medical Curriculum of Indonesia. In conclusion, in case of HMPX outbreak, majority of the GPs in Indonesia seem to be less confident in diagnosing and treating cases, using their current knowledge, skills and their workplace facilities.

However, no method for accurate and easy DEFB CN quantification is yet available. OBJECTIVE: Droplet digital polymerase chain reaction (ddPCR) is a novel method for CNV quantification and has been used for genes such as CCL4L, CCL3L1, AMY1, and HER2. However, to date, no ddPCR assay has been available for DEFB CN determination. In the present study, we aimed to develop and evaluate such a ddPCR assay. METHODS: The assay was designed using DEFB4 and RPP30 as the target and the reference gene, respectively. To evaluate the assay, 283 DNA samples with known CNs previously determined using the multiple ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) method, the current gold standard, were used as standards. To discover the optimal DNA template amount, we tested 80 to 2.5 ng DNA by a serial of one to two dilutions of eight samples. To evaluate the reproducibility of the assay, 31 samples were repeated to calculate the intra- and inter-assay variations. To further validate the reliability of the assay, the CNs of all 283 samples were determined using ddPCR. To compare results with those using quantitative PCR (qPCR), DEFB CNs for 48 samples were determined using qPCR with the same primers and probes. RESULTS: In a one-dimensional plot, the positive and negative droplets were clearly separated in both DEFB4 and RPP30 detection channels. In a two-dimensional plot, four populations of droplets were observed. The 20 ng template DNA proved optimal, with either high (80 ng) or low (10, 5, 2.5 ng) template input leading to ambiguous or inaccurate results. For the 31 standard samples, DEFB CNs were accurately determined with small intra- and inter-assay variations (coefficient of variation < 0.04 for both). In the validation cohort, ddPCR provided the correct CN for all 283 samples with high confidence. qPCR measurements for the 48 samples produced noisy data with high uncertainty and low accuracy. CONCLUSIONS: ddPCR is an accurate, reproducible, easy-to-use, cheap, high-throughput method for DEFB CN determination. ddPCR could be applied to DEFB CN quantification in large-scale case–control studies.

CD8 T cells play an important role in controlling diseases caused by other coronaviruses and in mediating vaccine-induced protective immunity in corresponding animal models. The spike protein, a main surface antigen of SARS-CoV, is one of the most important antigen candidates for vaccine design. Overlapping peptides were used to identify major histocompatibility complex class I-restricted epitopes in mice immunized with vectors encoding codon-optimized SARS-CoV spike protein. CD8 T-cell responses were mapped to two H-2(b)-restricted epitopes (S436–443 and S525–532) and one H-2(d)-restricted epitope (S366–374). The identification of these epitopes will facilitate the evaluation of vaccine strategies in murine models of SARS-CoV infection. Furthermore, codon and promoter optimizations can greatly enhance the overall immunogenicity of spike protein in the context of replication-defective human and simian adenoviral vaccine carriers. The optimized recombinant adenoviral vaccine vectors encoding spike can generate robust antigen-specific cellular immunity in mice and may potentially be useful for control of SARS-CoV infection.","Zhi, Yan; Kobinger, Gary P.; Jordan, Heather; Suchma, Katie; Weiss, Susan R.; Shen, Hao; Schumer, Gregory; Gao, Guangping; Boyer, Julie L.; Crystal, Ronald G.; Wilson, James M.",Virology,188,29

Upon entry, the virus uses its RNA dependent RNA polymerase (NSP12) for transcribing its genome to survive in the cell and spread its infection. The protein sequences of receptor-binding domain (RBD) of spike glycoprotein, and NSP12 exhibits high homology in the family of Coronoviridae and are ideal candidates for the development of anti-coronaviral drugs. In the quest to identify inhibitory molecules against these proteins, we searched several molecules that are present in naturally occurring medicinal plants database. Andrographolide which is largely present in the leaf extracts of Andrographis paniculata (AP) and is known to exhibit antiviral, antibacterial, and stabilizes Th1/Th2/Th17 responses; taking this clue, we used in silico approaches to see the binding of andrographolide to RBD and NSP12 molecules. Our docking results showed very strong affinity of andrographolide to RBD and NSP12 of the SARS-CoV-2 virus with dock scores of −10.3460 for RBD and −10.7313 for NSP12 indicating andrographolide acts as an inhibitor of RBD and NSP12. These unique properties of andrographolide, AP extract, can be tested as anti-coronaviral drug.","Srikanth, Lokanathan; Sarma, Potukuchi Venkata Gurunadha Krishna",J Genet Eng Biotechnol,188,1

The SARS-CoV-2 virus enters the host cells by binding to the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE2). Although much of the focus is on respiratory symptoms, recent reports suggest that SARS-CoV-2 can cause pregnancy complications such as pre-term birth and miscarriages; and women with COVID-19 had maternal vascular malperfusion and decidual arteriopathy in their placentas. Here, we report that ACE2 protein is expressed in both endometrial epithelial and stromal cells in the proliferative phase of the menstrual cycle, and expression increases in stromal cells in the secretory phase. The ACE2 mRNA and protein abundance increased during primary human endometrial stromal cell (HESC) decidualization. Further, HESCs transfected with ACE2-targeting siRNA impaired the full decidualization response, as evidenced by a lack of morphology change and lower expression of the decidualization markers PRL and IGFBP1. Additionally, in mice during pregnancy, ACE2 protein was expressed in uterine epithelial, and stromal cells increased through day six of pregnancy. Finally, progesterone induced Ace2 mRNA expression in mouse uteri more than vehicle or estrogen. These data establish a role for ACE2 in endometrial physiology, suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 may be able to enter endometrial stromal cells and elicit pathological manifestations in women with COVID-19 including an increased risk of early pregnancy loss.","Chadchan, Sangappa B; Popli, Pooja; Maurya, Vineet K; Kommagani, Ramakrishna",Biol Reprod,188,26

As a result, implementing sustainable infectious disease surveillance systems in these regions is challenging. The cost of these programs and difficulties associated with collecting, storing and transporting relevant samples have hindered them in the regions where they are most needed. Therefore, we tested the sensitivity and feasibility of a novel surveillance technique called xenosurveillance. This approach utilizes the host feeding preferences and behaviors of Anopheles gambiae, which are highly anthropophilic and rest indoors after feeding, to sample viruses in human beings. We hypothesized that mosquito bloodmeals could be used to detect vertebrate viral pathogens within realistic field collection timeframes and clinically relevant concentrations. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: To validate this approach, we examined variables influencing virus detection such as the duration between mosquito blood feeding and mosquito processing, the pathogen nucleic acid stability in the mosquito gut and the pathogen load present in the host’s blood at the time of bloodmeal ingestion using our laboratory model. Our findings revealed that viral nucleic acids, at clinically relevant concentrations, could be detected from engorged mosquitoes for up to 24 hours post feeding by qRT-PCR. Subsequently, we tested this approach in the field by examining blood from engorged mosquitoes from two field sites in Liberia. Using next-generation sequencing and PCR we were able to detect the genetic signatures of multiple viral pathogens including Epstein-Barr virus and canine distemper virus. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Together, these data demonstrate the feasibility of xenosurveillance and in doing so validated a simple and non-invasive surveillance tool that could be used to complement current biosurveillance efforts.","Grubaugh, Nathan D.; Sharma, Supriya; Krajacich, Benjamin J.; Fakoli III, Lawrence S.; Bolay, Fatorma K.; Diclaro II, Joe W.; Johnson, W.

Over a two-week period (16–30 March 2020), 150 cancer patients in Germany participated in this study. Validated instruments assessed demographic and medical data, depression and anxiety symptoms (PHQ-2, GAD-2), distress (DT), and health status (EQ-5D-3L). All instruments were adapted to measure the individual mental health before the COVID-19 outbreak. COVID-19-related fear, trust in governmental actions to face COVID-19, and the subjective level of information regarding COVID-19 were measured. Cancer patients showed a significant increase in depression and anxiety symptoms and distress, while health status deteriorated since the COVID-19 outbreak. Increased depression and generalized anxiety symptoms were predicted by COVID-19-related fear. Trust in governmental actions to face COVID-19 and COVID-19-related fear predicted increases in distress. Higher subjective levels of information predicted less increasing anxiety symptoms and distress. Present data suggests that cancer patients experienced a significant increase in mental health burden since the COVID-19 outbreak. Observed predictors of mental health impairment and protective factors should be addressed, and appropriate interventions established, to maintain mental health of cancer patients during the pandemic.","Bäuerle, Alexander; Musche, Venja; Schmidt, Kira; Schweda, Adam; Fink, Madeleine; Weismüller, Benjamin; Kohler, Hannah; Herrmann, Ken; Tewes, Mitra; Schadendorf, Dirk; Skoda, Eva-Maria; Teufel, Martin",Int J Environ Res Public Health,188,16

The disease has since spread globally. Many countries have instated measures to slow the spread of the virus. Information about the spread of the virus in a country can inform the gradual reopening of a country and help to avoid a second wave of infections. Our study focuses on Denmark, which is opening up when this study is performed (end-May 2020) after a lockdown in mid-March. METHODS: We perform a phylogenetic analysis of 742 publicly available Danish SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences and put them into context using sequences from other countries. RESULTS: Our findings are consistent with several introductions of the virus to Denmark from independent sources. We identify several chains of mutations that occurred in Denmark. In at least one case we find evidence that the virus spread from Denmark to other countries. A number of the mutations found in Denmark are non-synonymous, and in general there is a considerable variety of strains. The proportions of the most common haplotypes remain stable after lockdown. CONCLUSION: Employing phylogenetic methods on Danish genome sequences of SARS-CoV-2, we exemplify how genetic data can be used to trace the introduction of a virus to a country. This provides alternative means for verifying existing assumptions. For example, our analysis supports the hypothesis that the virus was brought to Denmark by skiers returning from Ischgl. On the other hand, we identify transmission routes which suggest that Denmark was part of a network of countries among which the virus was being transmitted. This challenges the common narrative that Denmark only got infected from abroad. Our analysis concerning the ratio of haplotypes does not indicate that the major haplotypes appearing in Denmark have a different degree of virality.","Bluhm, Andreas; Christandl, Matthias; Gesmundo, Fulvio; Ravn Klausen, Frederik; Mančinska, Laura; Steffan, Vincent; Stilck França, Daniel; Werner, Albert H.",PLoS One,188,16

The imbalance between what is medically possible and financially feasible is frequently rendered as an issue of tragic choices, giving rise to public controversies around health care rationing. MAIN BODY: We analyse the Norwegian media discourse on expensive cancer drugs and identify four underlying premises: (1) Cancer drugs are de facto expensive, and one does not and should not question why. (2) Cancer drugs have an indubitable efficacy. (3) Any lifetime gained for a cancer patient is an absolute good, and (4) cancer patients and doctors own the truth about cancer. Applying a principle-based approach, we argue that these premises should be challenged on moral grounds. Within the Norwegian public discourse, however, the premises largely remain unchallenged due to what we find to be unjustified claims of moral superiority. We therefore explore alternative framings of the issue of expensive cancer drugs and discuss their potential to escape the predicament of tragic choices. CONCLUSIONS: In a media discourse that has seemingly stagnated, awareness of the framings within it is necessary in order to challenge the current tragic choices predicament the discourse finds itself in. In order to allow for a discourse not solely concerned with the issue of tragic choices, the premises that underlie it must be subjected to critical examination. As the field of oncology advances rapidly, we depend on a discussion of its opportunities and challenges that is meaningful, and that soberly addresses the future of cancer care—both its potential and its limits.","Stenmarck, Mille Sofie; Engen, Caroline; Strand, Roger",BMC Med Ethics,188,16

A similar clinical profile occurs in severe trauma cases. This review compares pathophysiological and therapeutic principles of severely injured trauma patients and severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The development of sequential organ failure in trauma parallels deterioration seen in severe COVID-19. Based on established pathophysiological models in the field of trauma, two complementary pathways of disease progression into severe COVID-19 have been identified. Furthermore, the transition from local contained disease into systemic and remote inflammation has been addressed. More specifically, the traumatology concept of sequential insults (‘hits’) resulting in immune dysregulation, is applied to COVID-19 disease progression modelling. Finally, similarities in post-insult humoral and cellular immune responses to severe trauma and severe COVID-19 are described. To minimize additional ‘hits’ to COVID-19 patients, we suggest postponing all elective surgery in endemic areas. Based on traumatology experience, we propose that immunoprotective protocols including lung protective ventilation, optimal thrombosis prophylaxis, secondary infection prevention and calculated antibiotic therapy are likely also beneficial in the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infections. Finally, rising SARS-CoV-2 infection and mortality rates mandate exploration of out-of-the box treatment concepts, including experimental therapies designed for trauma care.","Teuben, Michel P.

SARS-CoV-2 survival and virulence are shown to be impacted by glycans, covalently attached to proteins in a process of glycosylation, making glycans an area of interest in SARS-CoV-2 biology and COVID-19 infection. The SARS-CoV-2 uses its highly glycosylated spike (S) glycoproteins to bind to the cell surface receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) glycoprotein and facilitate host cell entry. Viral glycosylation has wide-ranging roles in viral pathobiology, including mediating protein folding and stability, immune evasion, host receptor attachment, and cell entry. Modification of SARS-CoV-2 envelope membrane with glycans is important in host immune recognition and interaction between S and ACE2 glycoproteins. On the other hand, immunoglobulin G, a key molecule in immune response, shows a distinct glycosylation profile in COVID-19 infection and with increased disease severity. Hence, further studies on the role of glycosylation in SARS-CoV-2 infectivity and COVID-19 infection are needed for its successful prevention and treatment.

While the analogous event in China appears to be rather under control at the moment, the outbreaks in western countries are still at an early stage of the evolution. Italy at present is playing a major role in understanding transmission dynamics of these new infections and evaluating the effectiveness of control measures in a western social context. Methods: We combined a quarantined models with early stage evolution data in Italy (during February 20th - March 30th) to predict longer term evolution (March 30th, on ...) within different control measures. Due to significant variations in the control strategies, which have been changing over time, and thanks to the introduction of detection technologies leading to faster confirmation of the SARS-CoV-2 infections, we made use of time-dependent contact and diagnose rates to estimate when the effective daily reproduction ratio can fall below 1. Within the same framework we analyze the possible event of a secondary infection after relaxing the isolation measures. Outcomes and interpretation: We study two simplified scenarios compatible with the observation data and the effects of two stringent measures on the evolution of the epidemic. On one side the contact rate must obviously kept as low as possible, but it is also clear that, in a modern developed country, it cannot fall under certain minimum levels and for long time. The complementary parameter tuned is the transition rate of the symptomatic infected individuals to the quarantined class, a parameter δ_I connected with the time t_I=1/δ_I needed to perform diagnostic tests. Within the conditions of the outbreak in Italy this time must fall under 12-8 hours in order to make the reproduction number less than 1 to minimize the case numbers. Moreover we show how the same parameter plays an even more relevant role in mitigating the effects of a possible secondary infection event.","Traini, Marco Claudio; Caponi, Carla; Ferrari, Riccardo; De Socio, Giuseppe Vittorio",,188,23

Reliable and comprehensive estimation method of the epidemiological data is required to understand the actual situation of fatalities caused by the epidemic. Case Fatality Rate (CFR) is one of the cardinal epidemiological parameters that adequately explains epidemiology of the outbreak of a disease. In the present study, we employed two statistical regression models such as the linear and polynomial models in order to estimate the CFR, based on the early phase of COVID-19 outbreak in Nigeria (44 days since first reported COVID-19 death). The estimate of the CFR was determined based on cumulative number of confirmed cases and deaths reported from 23 March to 30 April 2020. The results from the linear model estimated that the CFR was 3.11% (95% CI: 2.59–3.80%) with R(2) value of 90% and p-value of <0.0001. The findings from the polynomial model suggest that the CFR associated with the Nigerian outbreak is 3.0% and may range from 2.23 to 3.42% with R(2) value of 93% and p-value of <0.0001. Therefore, the polynomial regression model with the higher R(2) value fits the dataset well and provides better estimate of CFR for the reported COVID-19 cases in Nigeria.","Suleiman, Ahmad Abubakar; Suleiman, Aminu; Abdullahi, Usman Aliyu; Suleiman, Suleiman Abubakar",Biosaf Health,188,21

Eighty-eight patients (48%) were intubated before 48 h (early) and ninety-five (52%) after 48 h (late). Patients intubated early had similar admission PaO(2)/FiO(2) ratio (123 vs 99; p = 0.179) but were younger (59 vs 64; p = 0.013) and had higher body mass index (30 vs 28; p = 0.006) compared to patients intubated late.

Only 27% of responders provided hospital service, and 18.4% were allotted a non-dermatologic duty. A substantial percentage (64.4%) indicated the availability of hospital issued management guidelines (HIMG) for COVID-19 patients.

In conclusion, substantial percentages of responders had to purchase their own PPE and were not provided with it at the hospital. Strategies to increase PPE availability should be implemented by hospitals, industry, and government authorities.","Bhargava, Shashank; McKeever, Charles; Sadoughifar, Roxanna; Kroumpouzos, George",Clin Dermatol,188,24

While numerous models and approaches to professional development for teachers exist, few parallels can be drawn between the professional development of teachers and teacher educators (Loughran, 2014). To support the multi-faceted identity (trans)formation of STEM teacher educators, self-directed learning opportunities can help bridge knowledge and practice, enhance productive collaboration, and support efforts to negotiate multiple and conflicting agendas (Goodwin & Kosnik, 2013). The purpose of this empirical study was to explore the identity (trans)formation of teacher educators participating in a long-term interdisciplinary STEM-based Community of Practice (CoP; Wenger, 1998), which began in 2012. An analysis of our experiences through the figured worlds lens informs how a CoP can impact curricular approaches and teacher PD, imploring members to move through their comfort zones into innovative spaces. We conclude with suggestions for our STEM teacher educator colleagues who seek opportunities to challenge their own positions and best support preservice and in-service STEM teachers in a way that allows them to model for their students the value of community.","Weinberg, Andrea E.; Balgopal, Meena M.; Sample McMeeking, Laura B.",Int J Sci Math Educ,188,21

Every day, a number of hospitals are performing various surgical procedures. Even more number of invasive procedures are being performed in different health care facilities. The medical device or the surgical instrument that comes in contact with the sterile tissue or the mucus membrane of the patient during the various processes is associated with increased risk of introduction of pathogens into the patient's body. Moreover, there is chance of transmission of infection from patient to patient; from patient or to health care personnel, and vice versa; or from the environment to the patient through the improper sterilized or disinfected devices. Hence, medical personnel, laboratory people and the health care providers should have better knowledge regarding these techniques to prevent the spread of these pathogens.","Mohapatra, S.",Essentials of Neuroanesthesia,188,3

Diversity means that there is no typical older person. Policy should be framed to improve the functional ability of all older people, whether they are robust, care dependent or in between. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this article is to describe negative influence of Corona pandemic (COVID-19) for realization of the WHO project about Healthy Aging global strategy proposed in the targets ""Health for all"". METHODS: Authors used descriptive model for this cross-sectional study based on facts in analyzed scientific literature deposited in on-line databases about healthy aging concept of the prevention and treatment of the people who will come or already came to the ""third trimester of the life"". RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Some 80-year-olds have levels of physical and mental capacity that compare favorably with 30-year-olds. Others of the same age may require extensive care and support for basic activities like dressing and eating. Policy should be framed to improve the functional ability of all older people, whether they are robust, care dependent or in between. Inequity reflects a large proportion (approximately 75%) of the diversity in capacity and circumstance observed in older age is the result of the cumulative impact of advantage and disadvantage across people’s lives. Importantly, the relationships we have with our environments are shaped by factors such as the family we were born into, our sex, ethnicity, level of education and financial resources. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 pandemic ""celebrated"" one year of existing in almost all countries in the world with very difficult consequences for whole population. But in the first risk group are old people who have in average 6 to 7 co-morbidities. WHO recommended some measures to improve prevention and treatment this category of population, but COVID-19 pandemic stopped full realization of Decade of Healthy Aging project.","Kurjak, Asim; Jakovljevic, Miro; Masic, Izet; Stanojevic, Milan",Med Arch,188,32

In this context, a crypto-network is designed using bid/ask data among 20 crypto-exchanges over a 2-year period. The graph theory technique is employed to describe the network and, more importantly, to determine the key roles of crypto-exchanges in generating arbitrage opportunities by estimating relevant network centrality measures. Based on the proposed arbitrage ratio, Gatecoin, Coinfloor, and Bitsane are estimated as the best exchanges to initiate arbitrage, while EXMO and DSX are the best places to close it. Furthermore, by means of canonical correlation analysis, we revealed that higher volatility and the decreasing price of dominating crypto-currencies and CRIX index signal bring about a more likely arbitrage appearance in the market.

We aimed to evaluate the benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) patients who were admitted and treated to our hospital due to COVID‐19. METHODS: Between March 18, 2020 and April 5, 2020, 18 patients admitted with COVID‐19 who has BPH and are using medication for this were included in the study and analyzed retrospectively. Diagnosis was confirmed by COVID‐19 nucleic acid test by sampling sputum or nasopharyngeal swab. Standard COVID‐19 treatment protocol determined by our Ministry of Health was applied to all patients according to their risk groups. Epidemiological, clinical, radiological features, additional diseases, laboratory tests, complications and outcome data of all patients were recorded. RESULTS: Mean age of patients was 59.6 (range: 56‐73). As the mode of transmission, 10 (55.5%) of patients were infected in hospital, 5 (27.7%) patients had a relative with COVID‐19 and 3 (16,6%) was unknown. During follow‐up, 2 (11.1%) patients were transferred to intensive care unit (ICU). One of these patients dramatically progressed and died. Patients who survived and were not transferred to ICU had lesser comorbidities and were relatively young. Mean duration of hospitalization was 14.2 days (range 12‐19). CONCLUSION: We think that COVID‐19 patients with BPH had a low mortality rate and did not have a poor prognosis in this patient group. It is crucial to take comprehensive preventive measures to control COVID‐19 transmission via hospital route.","Topaktaş, Ramazan; Tokuç, Emre; Kutluhan, Musab Ali; Akyüz, Mehmet; Karabay, Emre; Çalışkan, Selahattin",Int J Clin Pract,188,27

METHODS: We developed strategies to prevent hospital-associated transmission of COVID-19 in obstetric care. Infrastructure, including the fever clinic and wards, were modified. Outpatient volume was controlled and screening processes were strictly performed. Verification of the virus was compulsory for non-surgery and non-emergency patients. Emergency operations were performed in a negative pressure theater with surgeons fully protected. Outcomes were analyzed and the patients’ characteristics were evaluated. The effect of intervention on depressed and anxious patients was assessed. Data from the first 2 months of 2019 and 2020 were compared. RESULTS: No in-hospital COVID-19 infections occurred in our unit. During the epidemic, patient volume significantly decreased. While major characteristics of patients were similar, a higher prevalence of gestational hypertension was found in 2020 than in 2019. Psychological interventions showed optimistic effects in ameliorating depression and anxiety at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic.

We get some insight by considering demands a virus places on host cells. Viruses not only require production of their own proteins, RNA and/or DNA, but also production of additional cellular machinery, such as ribosomes, to handle the increased demands. Since the nucleolus is a major site of RNA processing and ribonucleoprotein assembly, nucleoli are targeted by viruses, directly when viral RNA and proteins enter the nucleolus and indirectly when viruses induce increased expression of cellular polyamine genes. Polyamines are at high levels in nucleoli to assist in RNA folding. The size and activity of nucleoli increase directly with increases in polyamines. Nucleolar expansion due to abnormal increases in polyamines could disrupt nearby chromatin, such as the inactive X chromosome, leading to expression of previously sequestered DNA. Sudden expression of a large concentration of Alu elements from the disrupted inactive X can compete with RNA transcripts containing intronic Alu sequences that normally maintain nucleolar structural integrity. Such disruption of nucleolar activity can lead to misfolded RNAs, misassembled ribonucleoprotein complexes, and fragmentation of the nucleolus. Many autoantigens in lupus are, at least transiently, components of the nucleolus. Considering these effects of viruses, the “X chromosome–nucleolus nexus” hypothesis, which proposed disruption of the inactive X by the nucleolus during stress, is now expanded here to propose subsequent disruption of the nucleolus by previously sequestered Alu elements, which can fragment the nucleolus, leading to generation of autoantigens.","Brooks, Wesley H.",Front Immunol,188,28

Deferring hospitalization and non-urgent surgeries has become a priority for surgeons today in order to relieve the health care system. It is obviously not simple to reduce emergency surgery without altering the quality of care or leading to a loss of chance for the patient. Acute appendicitis is a very specific situation and the prevalence of this disease leads us to reconsider this particular disease in the context of the COVID-19 crisis. Indeed, while the currently recommended treatment for uncomplicated acute appendicitis is surgical appendectomy, the non-surgical alternative of medical management by antibiotic therapy alone has been widely evaluated by high-quality studies in the literature. Insofar as the main limitation of exclusively medical treatment of uncomplicated acute appendicitis is the risk of recurrent appendicitis, this treatment option represents an alternative of choice to reduce the intra-hospital overload in this context of health crisis. The aim of this work is therefore to provide physicians and surgeons with a practical guide based on a review of the literature on the medical treatment of uncomplicated acute appendicitis in adults, to offer this alternative treatment to the right patients and under good conditions, especially when access to the operating room is limited or impossible.","Collard, Maxime; Lefevre, Jérémie H.; Maggiori, Léon",J Visc Surg,188,7

Fecal microbiota transplant (FMT) could be a promising approach. APPROACH AND RESULTS: In this phase 1, double-blind, randomized clinical trial, patients with AUD-related cirrhosis with problem drinking (AUDIT-10 > 8) were randomized 1:1 into receiving one placebo or FMT enema from a donor enriched in Lachnospiraceae and Ruminococcaceae. Six-month safety was the primary outcome. Alcohol craving questionnaire, alcohol consumption (urinary ethylglucuronide/creatinine), quality of life, cognition, serum IL-6 and lipopolysaccharide-binding protein, plasma/stool short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), and stool microbiota were tested at baseline and day 15. A 6-month follow-up with serious adverse event (SAE) analysis was performed. Twenty patients with AUD-related cirrhosis (65 ± 6.4 years, all men, Model for End-Stage Liver Disease 8.9 ± 2.7) with similar demographics, cirrhosis, and AUD severity were included. Craving reduced significantly in 90% of FMT versus 30% in placebo at day 15 (P = 0.02) with lower urinary ethylglucuronide/creatinine (P = 0.03) and improved cognition and psychosocial quality of life. There was reduction in serum IL-6 and lipopolysaccharide-binding protein and increased butyrate/isobutyrate compared with baseline in FMT but not placebo. Microbial diversity increased with higher Ruminococcaceae and other SCFAs, producing taxa following FMT but not placebo, which were linked with SCFA levels. At 6 months, patients with any SAEs (8 vs. 2, P = 0.02), AUD-related SAEs (7 vs. 1, P = 0.02), and SAEs/patient (median [interquartile range], 1.5 [1.25] vs. 0 [0.25] in FMT, P = 0.02) were higher in placebo versus FMT. CONCLUSIONS: This phase 1 trial shows that FMT is safe and associated with short-term reduction in alcohol craving and consumption with favorable microbial changes versus placebo in patients with alcohol-associated cirrhosis with alcohol misuse. There was also a reduction in AUD-related events over 6 months in patients assigned to FMT.","Bajaj, Jasmohan S; Gavis, Edith A; Fagan, Andrew; Wade, James B; Thacker, Leroy R; Fuchs, Michael; Patel, Samarth; Davis, Brian; Meador, Jill; Puri, Puneet; Sikaroodi, Masoumeh; Gillevet, Patrick M",Hepatology,188,1

The current scientific consensus recommended breast-feed milk for all newborns for at least 6 months. They stated that it is possible to meet the nutritional needs of two or more newborns with only one mother’s milk. More information would be desirable about the factors that influence or lead to the initiation and interruption of breastfeeding. The quality of the evidence available from multiple studies has been inconclusive and therefore led to controversial interpretations and practices. Aims: The first aim of this study was to analyze the extent of the feeding of multiples with breast milk in the experience of our clinical unit in terms of incidence and duration. The second objective was to evaluate the correlation between maternal, perinatal and neonatal variables with breast milk feeding rates and duration. Methods: The study was conducted between 2015 and 2020, in a NICU in Southern Italy (San Giovanni Rotondo, Foggia). Sixty-one women who have given birth to multiples were enrolled into the study. Newborn data were retrospectively collected by informatic database and breastfeeding information were collected by a questionnaire. Results: In our centre, the percentage of twins out of the total number of births over the years has almost doubled from 1.28% in 2015 to 2.48% in 2020 and the 88% of twins are premature. 18.1% received breast milk for more than 6 months and 6.3% received it for more than 12 months. Infants of lower gestational age and weight, born to multiparous, more mature and medium-high schooling mothers received breast milk for a longer period. 35% of women explained that the interruption of breastfeeding was due to the insufficient milk production and 41% to the stress and difficulties in managing the twins. Qualitative analysis of maternal narrative revealed, for many of them, the awareness of the importance of breastfeeding and the efforts made to try to give breast milk, but also fears about the quantity of milk and satiety of their children. Conclusions: It is important to identify the factors both favoring and obstructing maternal milk feeding of multiples and it would be desirable the activation of a network of training and support for mothers after discharge, with particular regard to the categories found to be less inclined.","Quitadamo, Pasqua Anna; Comegna, Laura; Palumbo, Giuseppina; Copetti, Massimiliano; Lurdo, Paola; Zambianco, Federica; Gentile, Maria Assunta; Villani, Antonio",Nutrients,188,18

Inclusion criteria Women will be invited to participate in the trial and sign an informed consent if they meet the following inclusion criteria. • Presenting with fever (≥37.5°C) and/or one mild symptom suggestive of COVID-19 disease (cough, dyspnoea, chills, odynophagia, diarrhoea, muscle pain, anosmia, dysgeusia, headache) OR being contact* of a SARS-CoV-2 confirmed or suspected case in the past 14 days • More than 12 weeks of gestation (dated by ultrasonography) • Agreement to deliver in the study hospitals Exclusion criteria • Known hypersensitivity to HCQ or other 4-amonoquinoline compounds • History of retinopathy of any aetiology • Concomitant use of digoxin, cyclosporine, cimetidine • Known liver disease • Clinical history of cardiac pathology including known long QT syndrome • Unable to cooperate with the requirements of the study • Participating in other intervention studies • Delivery onset (characterized by painful uterine contractions and variable changes of the cervix, including some degree of effacement and slower progression of dilatation up to 5 cm for first and subsequent labours) The study participants will be stratified by clinical presentation and SARS-CoV-2 PCR results. Assignment of participants to study groups will be as follows: • SARS-CoV-2-PCR confirmed, infected pregnant women: a. symptomatic (n=100) b. asymptomatic (n=100) • SARS-CoV-2 PCR negative pregnant women in contact* with a SARS-CoV-2-infected confirmed or suspected case (n=514). *The ECDC definition of close contact will be followed. The trial will be conducted in five hospitals in Spain: Hospital Clínic of Barcelona, Hospital Sant Joan de Déu and Hospital de la Santa Creu i Sant Pau, in Barcelona, and HM Puerta del Sur and Hospital Universitario de Torrejón, in Madrid. INTERVENTION AND COMPARATOR: Participants will be randomized to HCQ (400 mg/day for three days, followed by 200 mg/day for 11 days) or placebo (2 tablets for three days, followed by one tablet for 11 days). MAIN OUTCOMES: The primary outcome is the number of PCR-confirmed infected pregnant women assessed from collected nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs at day 21 after treatment start (one week after treatment is completed). RANDOMISATION: Allocation of participants to study arms will be done centrally by the trial’s Sponsor (the Barcelona Institute for Global Health, ISGlobal) by block randomization. This method will ensure balanced allocation to both arms. The electronic CRF will automatically assign a study number to each participant, depending on her study group and recruitment site. Each number will be related to a treatment number, which assigns them to one of the study arms. BLINDING (MASKING): Participants, caregivers, investigators and those assessing the outcomes will be blinded to group assignment. Study tablets (HCQ and placebo) will be identically packaged in small opaque bottles. NUMBERS TO BE RANDOMISED (SAMPLE SIZE): This study requires 200 SARS-CoV-2 infected and 514 contact pregnant women, randomised 1:1 with 100 and 227 respectively in each study arm.

The present study explores the role of tripeptidyl peptidase II (TPPII), a serine peptidase contributing to protein turnover by acting downstream of the proteasome, in regulating coxsackievirus infection. Inhibition of TPPII does not affect virus replication in cells with functional proteasome. However, when the proteasome is impaired, TPPII appears to serve as an alternative to maintain low levels of virus infection. Our results suggest an important function of TPPII in the maintenance of viral growth and may have implications for anti-viral therapy.","Zhang, Jingchun; Wong, Jerry; Gao, Guang; Luo, Honglin",FEBS Letters,188,33

METHODS: All HCWs in Wuhan Union Hospital and Wuhan Red Cross Hospital with either positive SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid or antibody test before April 18, 2020 were included. Exposure, epidemiologic, demographic information were retrospectively collected by a structured questionnaire. Medical records were also reviewed for clinical characteristics and CT images in HCWs. RESULTS: As of April 18, 2020, a total of 424 HCWs were identified. Among them, 276 (65.1%) were symptomatic and 148 (34.9%) were asymptomatic. 55 (19.9%) families of the symptomatic HCWs and 16 (10.8%) families of the asymptomatic HCWs were infected with SARS-CoV-2. HCWs with infected family members tend to be symptomatic cases (Odds ratio [OR], 2.053 [95% confidence interval (CI), 1.130-3.730]; P=0.018). Multivariable logistic regression analysis exhibited that performing tracheal intubation or extubation (OR, 4.057 [95% CI, 1.183-13.909]; P=0.026) was associated with an increased likelihood of symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection, while consistent use of N95 respirators (OR, 0.369 [95% CI, 0.201-0.680]; P=0.001) and eye protection (OR, 0.217 [95% CI, 0.116-0.404]; P<0.001) were associated with an increased likelihood of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection. CONCLUSIONS: Asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection in HCWs occupies a considerable proportion during the pandemic of COVID-19. Those who have performed tracheal intubation or extubation were most likely to develop related symptoms, while those taking aggressive measures including consistent use of N95 masks, and eye protection tended to be asymptomatic cases.","Zhang, Shuai; Guo, Mengfei; Wu, Feng; Xiong, Nian; Ma, Yanling; Wang, Zhihui; Duan, Limin; Chen, Lan; Ouyang, Haixia; Jin, Yang",Clin Microbiol Infect,188,16

Despite 25 years of supportive legislation and policy in the UK, ethnicity data recording remains inconsistent, which has hindered needs assessment, evaluation and decision-making. We describe efforts to improve the completeness, quality and usage of ethnicity data within our regional health board, NHS Lothian. METHODS: The Ethnicity Coding Task Force was established with the aim of increasing ethnicity recording within NHS Lothian secondary care services from 3 to 90% over 3 years. We subsequently analysed these data specifically focusing on Accident and Emergency (A&E) use by ethnic group. RESULTS: We achieved 91%, 85% and 93% completeness of recording across inpatients, outpatients and A&E, respectively. Analysis of A&E data found a mixed pattern of attendance amongst ethnic minority populations and did not support the commonly perceived relationship between lower GP registration and higher A&E use within this population. CONCLUSIONS: We identified a successful approach to increase ethnicity recording within a regional health board, which could potentially be useful in other settings, and demonstrated the utility of these data in informing assessment of healthcare delivery and future planning.","Davidson, Emma M; Douglas, Anne; Villarroel, Nazmy; Dimmock, Katy; Gorman, Dermot; Bhopal, Raj S",J Public Health (Oxf),188,20

The vaccine was given subcutaneously to 129S6/SvEv mice in saline, with alum adjuvant or with alum plus CpG oligodeoxynucleotides (ODN). Mice immunized with the adjuvanted antigen elicited strong antibody and cellular immune responses; furthermore, adding the CpG ODN to the alum resulted in increased IgG2a antibody titers and a higher number of INF-γ-secreting murine splenocytes.

Among the new approaches that could be tested, that relying on nanotechnology finds one of its main grounds in the similarity between nanoparticle (NP) and coronavirus (COV) sizes, which promotes NP–COV interactions. Since COVID-19 is very recent, most studies in this field have focused on other types of coronavirus than COVID-19, such as those involved in MERS or SARS diseases. Although their number is limited, they have led to promising results on various COV using a wide range of different types of nanosystems, e.g., nanoparticles, quantum dos, or nanoassemblies of polymers/proteins. Additional efforts deserve to be spent in this field to consolidate these findings. Here, I first summarize the different nanotechnology-based methods used for COV detection, i.e., optical, electrical, or PCR ones, whose sensitivity was improved by the presence of nanoparticles. Furthermore, I present vaccination methods, which comprise nanoparticles used either as adjuvants or as active principles. They often yield a better-controlled immune response, possibly due to an improved antigen presentation/processing than in non-nanoformulated vaccines. Certain antiviral approaches also took advantage of nanoparticle uses, leading to specific mechanisms such as the blocking of virus replication at the cellular level or the reduction of a COV induced apoptotic cellular death.","Alphandéry, Edouard",Bioconjug Chem,188,16

Our study aims to develop and evaluate two rapid in-house ELISA assays targeting neutralizing antibodies (IgG) against S1 subunit of spike in SARS-CoV-2 and Receptor Binding Domain (RBD), as well as comparative analysis with nucleocapsid (NCP) ELISA. The assays were conducted with 184 samples in three panels collected from 134 patients. Panel 1 and 2 consist of RT-PCR positive samples collected within two weeks and after two weeks of symptom onset, respectively. Negative samples are included in panel 3 from healthy donors and pre-pandemic dengue patients. The total assay time has been set 30 minutes for both of the ELISA assays. Results show that S1 and RBD ELISA demonstrates 73.68% and 84.21% sensitivities, respectively for samples collected within two weeks, whereas 100% sensitivities were achieved by both for samples that were collected after two weeks of the onset of symptoms. S1-ELISA shows 0% positivity to panel 3 while for RBD-ELISA the figure is 1%. A strong correlation (rs=0.804, p<0.0001)) has been observed between these two assays. When compared with NCP-ELISA, S1 slightly better correlation (rs=0.800, p<0.0001) than RBD (rs=0.740, p<0.0001). Our study suggests S1-ELISA as more sensitive one than the RBD or nucleocapsid ELISA during the later phase of infection, while for overall sero-monitoring RBD specific IgG ELISA is recommended.

PATIENTS: Adult coronavirus disease 2019 acute respiratory distress syndrome patients managed with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation March 1, 2020, to July 31, 2020. INTERVENTIONS: Baseline variables, treatment measures, and short-term outcomes were obtained from the medical record. Survivors were interviewed by telephone, a year following the index intensive care admission. Functional outcome was assessed using the modified Rankin Scale and the World Health Organization Disability Assessment Scale 2.0. Cognitive status was assessed with the 5-minute Montreal Cognitive Assessment. The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale was used to screen for anxiety and depression. Screening for post-traumatic stress disorder was performed with the Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Checklist 5 instrument. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Twenty-three patients were managed with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, 14 (61%) survived to hospital discharge. Thirteen (57%) were alive at 1 year. One patient was dependent on mechanical ventilation, another intermittently required supplemental oxygen at 1 year. The median modified Rankin Scale score was 2 (interquartile range, 1–2), median World Health Organization Disability Assessment Scale 2.0 impairment score was 21% (interquartile range, 6–42%).

(R)-6 significantly attenuated lipopolysaccharide (LPS)- and tumor-necrosis-factor-α (TNF-α)-induced NF-κB activity in monocytes and vascular smooth muscle cells. The molecular target of (R)-6 was investigated. (R)-6 activated the endogenous LX receptor formyl peptide receptor 2 (ALX/FPR2). The anti-inflammatory properties of (R)-6 were further investigated in vivo in murine models of acute inflammation. Consistent with in vitro observations, (R)-6 attenuated inflammatory responses. These results support the therapeutic potential of the lead QNX-sLXm (R)-6 in the context of novel inflammatory regulators.","de Gaetano, Monica; Tighe, Catherine; Gahan, Kevin; Zanetti, Andrea; Chen, Jianmin; Newson, Justine; Cacace, Antonino; Marai, Mariam; Gaffney, Andrew; Brennan, Eoin; Kantharidis, Phillip; Cooper, Mark E.; Leroy, Xavier; Perretti, Mauro; Gilroy, Derek; Godson, Catherine; Guiry, Patrick J.",J Med Chem,188,2

Our model incorporates the asymptomatic infected individuals, who represent the majority of the infected population (with symptoms or not) and could play an important role in spreading the virus without any knowledge. We calculate the basic reproduction number (R0) via the next-generation matrix method and estimate the per day infection, death and recovery rates. The local stability of the disease free equilibrium is established in terms of R0. A sensibility analysis is performed to determine the relative importance of the model parameters to the disease transmission. We calibrate the parameters of the SEIARD model to the reported number of infected cases and fatalities for several states in Mexico by minimizing the sum of squared errors and attempt to forecast the evolution of the outbreak until August 2020.","Avila-Ponce de Leon, U.; Perez, A.

We recently reported a mouse-adapted SARS-CoV-2 virus strain (MA10) with the potential to infect wild-type laboratory mice, driving high levels of viral replication in respiratory tract tissues as well as severe clinical and respiratory symptoms, aspects of COVID-19 disease in humans that are important to capture in model systems. We evaluated the immunogenicity and protective efficacy of novel rhesus adenovirus serotype 52 (RhAd52) vaccines against MA10 challenge in mice. Baseline seroprevalence is lower for rhesus adenovirus vectors than for human or chimpanzee adenovirus vectors, making these vectors attractive candidates for vaccine development. We observed that RhAd52 vaccines elicited robust binding and neutralizing antibody titers, which inversely correlated with viral replication after challenge. These data support the development of RhAd52 vaccines and the use of the MA10 challenge virus to screen novel vaccine candidates and to study the immunologic mechanisms that underscore protection from SARS-CoV-2 challenge in wild-type mice. Importance We have developed a series of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines using rhesus adenovirus serotype 52 (RhAd52) vectors, which exhibits a lower seroprevalence than human and chimpanzee vectors, supporting their development as novel vaccine vectors or as an alternative Ad vector for boosting. We sought to test these vaccines using a recently reported mouse-adapted SARS-CoV-2 (MA10) virus to i) evaluate the protective efficacy of RhAd52 vaccines and ii) further characterize this mouse-adapted challenge model and probe immune correlates of protection. We demonstrate RhAd52 vaccines elicit robust SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody responses and protect against clinical disease and viral replication in the lungs. Further, binding and neutralizing antibody titers correlated with protective efficacy. These data validate the MA10 mouse model as a useful tool to screen and study novel vaccine candidates, as well as the development of RhAd52 vaccines for COVID-19.","Tostanoski, Lisa H; Gralinski, Lisa E; Martinez, David R; Schaefer, Alexandra; Mahrokhian, Shant H; Li, Zhenfeng; Nampanya, Felix; Wan, Huahua; Yu, Jingyou; Chang, Aiquan; Liu, Jinyan; McMahan, Katherine; Ventura, John D; Dinnon, Kenneth H; Leist, Sarah R; Baric, Ralph S; Barouch, Dan H",Journal of virology,188,20

National immunization programs conduct in-service training of health workers depending on program needs and particularly when new program elements are introduced. METHODS: we conducted a survey of national and provincial level immunization program staff in 9 countries in the World Health Organization (WHO) African Region to determine the perceived needs and preferred training methods for capacity building in immunisation. RESULTS: nearly all of the respondents (98.3%) stated that there are skill gaps at their respective levels in the immunization program which require training, with 88% indicating that mid-level program management (MLM) training was needed to train new program staff, while 78% indicated program performance gaps and 60% of the respondents stated that refresher training is needed. Program areas identified as top priorities for training included immunisation monitoring and data quality, sustainable immunization financing, adverse events monitoring and community mobilization. More than three quarters of the respondents (78%) think that online MLM training is adequate to address program gaps. Only four of the 9 immunization program managers indicated that they regularly monitor the number of MLM trained staff within their national program. CONCLUSION: there is a strong need for in-service training of immunization program officers in the countries surveyed, especially at the subnational levels. Program managers should conduct regular monitoring of the training status of staff, as well as conduct detailed training needs assessments in order to tailor the training approaches and topics. Online training provides an acceptable approach for capacity building of immunization program staff.","Masresha, Balcha Girma; Dochez, Carine; Bwaka, Ado; Eshetu, Meseret; Paluku, Gilson; Mihigo, Richard",Pan Afr Med J,188,22

CD6 is a glycoprotein expressed on mature T lymphocytes which is a crucial regulator of the T‐cell activation. Itolizumab is a humanised antibody targeting CD6. Nonclinical and clinical data in autoimmune diseases indicate that it lowers multiple cytokines primarily involving the Th1/Th17 pathway. The primary objective of this study was to assess the impact of itolizumab in arresting the lung function deterioration of COVID‐19 patients. Secondary objectives included safety, duration of ventilation, 14‐day mortality and evaluation of interleukin 6 concentration. METHODS: Patients with confirmed SARS‐CoV‐2 received itolizumab in combination with other therapies included in the national protocol for COVID‐19. RESULTS: Seventy critical, severe or moderate patients were treated with itolizumab in 10 Cuban hospitals. Median age was 68, and 94% had comorbidities. After 72 h, most patients improved the PO(2)/FiO(2) ratio and reduced FiO2 requirements. Ventilation time was 8 days for critical and 1 day for severe cases. Ten patients had related adverse events while 3 subjects developed related serious events. In 30 patients, interleukin 6 decreased in individuals with high level and did not change in those with lower concentration. Fourteen‐day lethality rate was 4% and 18% for moderate and severe patients, respectively. The proportion of moderate or severe patients with ventilation or death at day 14 was 9.8%. Time to treatment, neurological manifestations and biomarkers such as NLR were significantly associated with higher lethality. CONCLUSIONS: The opportune administration of itolizumab might interrupt the hyperinflammatory cascade and prevent COVID‐19 morbidity and mortality.","Caballero, Armando; Filgueira, Lázaro M; Betancourt, Julio; Sánchez, Naivy; Hidalgo, Carlos; Ramírez, Alberto; Martinez, Alejandro; Despaigne, Rolando E; Escalona, Alberto; Diaz, Henrry; Meriño, Elio; Ortega, Lilia M; Castillo, Ulises; Ramos, Mayra; Saavedra, Danay; García, Yanelda; Lorenzo, Geydi; Cepeda, Meylán; Arencibia, Maylén; Cabrera, Leticia; Domecq, Milagros; Estévez, Daymys; Valenzuela, Carmen; Lorenzo, Patricia; Sánchez, Lizet; Mazorra, Zaima; León, Kalet; Crombet, Tania",Clin Transl Immunology,188,4

METHODS: The Brazilian COVID-19 vaccination plan was evaluated and the hindrances to make the COVID-19 vaccination plan efficient were described and discussed. RESULTS: High territorial extension might contribute to a delay on the COVID-19 vaccination, due to difficulty in delivering vaccines to furthest Brazilian states and to all the interior cities. The choice among the vaccines should be done based on the type of storage and must consider the transport conditions necessary to maintain its effectiveness. The indigenous individuals were included with health-care workers as the first group to be vaccinated, inflaming the number of vaccines doses distributed in states where the indigenous population have higher prevalence. The antivaccine movement and the politicization of the vaccine are also hindrances to be overcome in Brazil. The COVID-19 incidence or mortality rate and the distribution of intensive care units (ICUs) are not a criterion to distribute the vaccines, as we did not identify a correlation between these markers and the number of vaccines. However, a strong or very strong correlation occurred between the number of COVID-19 vaccines and the number of COVID-19 cases, deaths by COVID-19, gross domestic product, as well as populational density. A total of 83,280,475 doses of COVID-19 vaccines were distributed in Brazil. In the first dose, the Coronavac (Sinovac™), AZD1222 (AstraZeneca/Oxford™), and BNT162b (Pfizer/BioNTech™) vaccines were responsible to vaccinate, respectively, 9.61%, 6.69%, and 0.35% of the Brazilian population. In the second dose, the Coronavac, AZD1222, and BNT162b vaccines were responsible to vaccinate, respectively, 7.52%, 0.53%, and <0.01% of the Brazilian population.

The purpose of this study is to investigate the effectiveness of the P4P system in terms of default rate. METHODS: This is a retrospective study. National Health Insurance Research Datasets in Taiwan from 2002 to 2005 has been used for the study. The study compared the differences of TB default rate before and after the implementation of P4P program, between participating and non-participating hospitals, and between P4P hospitals with and without case managers. Furthermore, logistic regression analysis was conducted to explore the related factors influencing TB patients default treatment after TB detected. RESULTS: The treatment default rate after “P4P on TB” was 11.37% compared with the 15.56% before “P4P on TB” implementation. The treatment default rate in P4P hospitals was 10.67% compared to 12.7% in non-P4P hospitals. In addition, the default rate was 10.4% in hospitals with case managers compared with 12.68% in hospitals without case managers. CONCLUSIONS: The results of the study showed that “P4P on TB” program improved the treatment default rate for TB patients.

Additionally, we investigated the association of physical activity levels with symptoms of the disease, length of hospital stay, and mechanical ventilation. DESIGN: Observational, cross-sectional. METHODS: Between June 2020 and August 2020, we invited Brazilian survivors and fully recovered patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 to respond to an online questionnaire. We shared the electronic link to the questionnaire on the internet. We collected data about clinical outcomes (symptoms, medications, hospitalization, and length of hospital stay) and cofactors, such as age, sex, ethnicity, preexisting diseases, socioeconomic and educational, and physical activity levels using the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ short version). RESULTS: Out of 938 patients, 91 (9.7%) were hospitalized due to COVID-19. In a univariate analysis, sex, age, and BMI were all associated with hospitalizations due to COVID-19. Men had a higher prevalence of hospitalization (66.6%, p=0.013). Patients older than 65 years, obese, and with preexisting disease had a higher prevalence of COVID-19-related hospitalizations. In a multivariate regression model, performance of at least 150 min/wk (moderate) and/or 75 min/wk (vigorous) physical activity was associated with a lower prevalence of hospitalizations after adjustment for age, sex, BMI, and preexisting diseases (PR=0.657; p=0.046). CONCLUSIONS: Sufficient physical activity levels were associated with a lower prevalence of COVID-19-related hospitalizations.

Surveying access to healthful food is costly and finding the factors that affect access remains convoluted owing to the multidimensional nature of socioeconomic variables. We utilize machine learning with census tract data to predict the modified Retail Food Environment Index (mRFEI), which refers to the percentage of healthful food retailers in a tract and agnostically extract the features of no access—corresponding to a “food desert” and low access—corresponding to a “food swamp.” Our model detects food deserts and food swamps with a prediction accuracy of 72% out of the sample. We find that food deserts and food swamps are intrinsically different and require separate policy attention. Food deserts are lightly populated rural tracts with low ethnic diversity, whereas swamps are predominantly small, densely populated, urban tracts, with more non-white residents who lack vehicle access. Overall access to healthful food retailers is mainly explained by population density, presence of black population, property value, and income. We also show that our model can be used to obtain sensible predictions of access to healthful food retailers for any U.S. census tract.","Amin, Modhurima Dey; Badruddoza, Syed; McCluskey, Jill J.",Food Policy,188,1

Increased knowledge is needed about the long‐term consequences. METHODS: This is a single‐center prospective follow‐up study of COVID‐19 patients admitted to the ICU for respiratory organ support between March and July 2020. Patients with invasive ventilation were compared with those with high‐flow nasal oxygen (HFNO) or non‐invasive ventilation (NIV) regarding functional outcome and health‐related qualify of life. The mean follow‐up time was 5 months after ICU discharge and included clinical history, three well‐validated questionnaires about health‐related quality of life and psychological health, pulmonary function test, 6‐minute walk test (6MWT) and work ability. Data were analyzed with multivariable general linear and logistic regression models with 95% confidence intervals. RESULTS: Among 248 ICU patients, 200 patients survived. Of these, 113 patients came for follow‐up. Seventy patients (62%) had received invasive ventilation. Most patients reported impaired health‐related quality of life.

METHODS: A prospective de‐identified electronic survey was distributed to adults with self‐reported facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD), myotonic dystrophy (DM), and limb‐girdle muscular dystrophy (LGMD) enrolled in national registries or with patient advocacy groups. The COVID‐19 Impact Survey was developed by muscular dystrophy experts in association with patient collaborators and advocacy groups. The Perceived Stress Scale was used to measure perceived stress. RESULTS: Respondents (n = 774: 56% FSHD; 35% DM, and 9% LGMD) were mostly women and middle‐aged (range 19–87 y). Rates of COVID‐19 infections were low (<1%), compliance with local social distancing guidelines and policies high (98%). Major challenges reported during the pandemic included: obtaining treatment (40%), managing stress (37%), social distancing (36%), and obtaining essentials (34%). The majority reported a slight worsening in their disease state. Respondents reported moderate stress levels (stress score = 15.4; range = 0–35), with higher stress levels reported by women and those under age 30 y. Three‐quarters of participants who participated in telemedicine visits were satisfied with the encounters; however, most reported a preference for in‐person visits. DISCUSSION: People with muscular dystrophy reported moderate stress and challenges during the COVID‐19 pandemic.

METHODS: Patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection underwent prospective follow-up with pulmonary function testing and blood gas analysis during steady-state cycle exercise 4 months after acute illness. Pulmonary function impairment (PFI) was defined as reduction below 80% predicted of DLCOcSB, TLC, FVC, or FEV1. Clinical data were analyzed to identify risk factors for impaired pulmonary function. RESULTS: 76 patients were included, hereof 35 outpatients with mild disease and 41 patients hospitalized due to COVID-19. Sixteen patients had critical disease requiring mechanical ventilation, 25 patients had moderate–severe disease. After 4 months, 44 patients reported persisting respiratory symptoms. Significant PFI was prevalent in 40 patients (52.6%) occurring among all disease severities. The most common cause for PFI was reduced DLCOcSB (n = 39, 51.3%), followed by reduced TLC and FVC. The severity of PFI was significantly associated with mechanical ventilation (p < 0.001). Further risk factors for DLCO impairment were COPD (p < 0.001), SARS-CoV-2 antibody-Titer (p = 0.014) and in hospitalized patients CT score. A decrease of paO2 > 3 mmHg during cycle exercise occurred in 1/5 of patients after mild disease course.

COVID‐19 became a pandemic 71 days later. AIM: To report the clinical and epidemiological features, laboratory data and outcomes of the first group of 11 returned travellers with COVID‐19 in Australia. METHODS: This is a retrospective, multi‐centre case series. All patients with confirmed COVID‐19 infection were admitted to tertiary referral hospitals in New South Wales, Queensland, Victoria and South Australia. RESULTS: The median age of our patient cohort was 42 years (IQR, 24–53 years) with six men and five women. Eight patients (72.7%) had returned from Wuhan, one from Shenzhen, one from Japan, and one from Europe. Possible human‐to‐human transmission from close family contacts in gatherings overseas occurred in two cases. Symptoms on admission were fever, cough and sore throat (n = 9, 81.8%). Co‐morbidities included hypertension (n = 3, 27.3%) and hypercholesterolaemia (n = 2, 18.2%). No patients developed severe acute respiratory distress nor required intensive care unit admission or mechanical ventilation. After a median hospital stay of 14.5 days (IQR, 6.75–21), all patients were discharged. CONCLUSIONS: This is a historical record of the first COVID‐19 cases in Australia during the early biocontainment phase of the national response. These findings were invaluable for establishing early inpatient and outpatient COVID‐19 models of care and informing the management of COVID‐19 overtime as the outbreak evolved. Future research should extend this Australian case series to examine global epidemiological variation of this novel infection. This article is protected by copyright.

A decrease in the number of pancreatic beta cells is a pathological sign of diabetes, and to date there is no drug treatment that targets damage to these cells. Pancreatic beta cells have a weak antioxidant system and are highly sensitive to oxidative stress reactions that occur within cells. Thioredoxin interacting protein (TXNIP) inhibits thioredoxin, which is part of the intracellular antioxidant system, thereby accelerating oxidative stress and apoptosis of pancreatic beta cells. Verapamil is a non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker. The efficacy of this drug to improve beta cell survival and glucose homeostasis by inhibiting TXNIP expression has been demonstrated in in vitro studies. Although several retrospective studies have shown a lower incidence of T2DM with verapamil treatment, no prospective intervention studies have determined the efficacy of this drug in patients with T2DM. METHODS: The aim of this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of oral verapamil administration in T2DM patients. In this 90-day study, the effects of verapamil on fasting blood sugar (FBS), hemoglobin A1C (HbA1c), and the lipid profile were evaluated and compared with those of the placebo. RESULTS: There was a significant decrease in HbA1c (about 0.5%) in the verapamil group at the end of the intervention period. The effects of verapamil on TXNIP gene expression and glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP1R) mRNA were compared with those of the placebo (at baseline, after 15 and 30 days, and at the end of the study). During the first month of the study, decreased TXNIP gene expression and increased GLP1R mRNA were associated with the administration of verapamil when compared with the placebo, although the differences were not significant. CONCLUSION: Verapamil can lead to better control of T2DM by reducing TXNIP gene expression and increasing beta cell survival and, possibly, by other mechanisms.

METHOD: A retrospective cohort study was conducted in a tertiary care hospital in the Southern region of Saudi Arabia. The CXRs were evaluated for the presence and distribution of ground-glass opacities (GGO), consolidation, pleural effusions, pneumothorax, cavitation, and nodules. RESULTS: A total of 120 CXRs from 15 MERS and six COVID-19 patients were assessed. In the first available CXR, GGO was present in 11 (73%) of the MERS patients (18% located in the middle zones and 67% located peripherally) and in 100% of COVID-19 patients (peripheral and middle zone involvement in all patients). In the first available CXRs, consolidation was present in 10 MERS patients (67%) and all six COVID-19 patients, while it was present in all patients of both groups when all the available CXRs were considered. Confluent consolidation was present in 47% of the MERS patients and 50% of COVID-19 patients. All the fatal cases had confluent consolidation and radiological signs of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Pneumothorax was present in 13% of patients, with 100% mortality, and pleural effusion was present in 47% of patients, with 57% mortality. Lung nodules were present in one patient of each group. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 patients showed earlier development of GGO and consolidation with greater involvement of the middle and peripheral lung zones. Confluent consolidation and ARDS-like radiological findings were associated with high mortality. Pneumothorax and pleural effusions were more frequent in MERS patients, with high associated mortality.","Alshumrani, Ghazi; Al Bshabshe, Ali; Mousa, Wesam Faried",Current medical imaging,188,6

Treatment of saliva samples prior to RT-LAMP by dilution 1:1 in Mucolyse™, followed by dilution in 10 % (w/v) Chelex© 100 Resin and a 98 °C heat step for 2 min enabled detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in positive saliva samples. Using RT-LAMP, SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in as little as 05:43 min, with no amplification detected in 3097 real-time reverse transcription PCR (rRT-PCR) negative saliva samples from staff tested within a service evaluation study, or for other respiratory pathogens tested (n = 22). Saliva samples can be collected non-invasively, without the need for skilled staff and can be obtained from both healthcare and home settings. Critically, this approach overcomes the requirement for, and validation of, different swabs and the global bottleneck in obtaining access to extraction robots and reagents to enable molecular testing by rRT-PCR. Such testing opens the possibility of public health approaches for effective intervention during the COVID-19 pandemic through regular SARS-CoV-2 testing at a population scale, combined with isolation and contact tracing.","Howson, Emma L.A.; Kidd, Stephen P.; Armson, Bryony; Goring, Alice; Sawyer, Jason; Cassar, Claire; Cross, David; Lewis, Tom; Hockey, Jess; Rivers, Samantha; Cawthraw, Saira; Banyard, Ashley; Anderson, Paul; Rahou, Sabah; Andreou, Michael; Morant, Nick; Clark, Duncan; Walsh, Charlotte; Laxman, Shailen; Houghton, Rebecca; Slater-Jefferies, Joanne; Costello, Paula; Brown, Ian; Cortes, Nicholas; Godfrey, Keith M.; Fowler, Veronica L.",J Virol Methods,188,16

We analyze the change in world-wide mobility at multiple spatio-temporal resolutions -- county, state, country -- using an anonymized aggregate mobility map that captures population flows between geographic cells of size 5 km2. We show that human mobility underwent an abrupt and significant change, partly in response to the interventions, resulting in 87% reduction of international travel and up to 75% reduction of domestic travel. Taking two very different countries sampled from the global spectrum, we observe a maximum reduction of 42% in mobility across different states of the United States (US), and a 68% reduction across the states of India between late March and late April. Since then, there has been an uptick in flows, with the US seeing 53% increase and India up to 38% increase with respect to flows seen during the lockdown. As we overlay this global map with epidemic incidence curves and dates of government interventions, we observe that as case counts rose, mobility fell -- often before stay-at-home orders were issued. Further, in order to understand mixing within a region, we propose a new metric to quantify the effect of social distancing on the basis of mobility. We find that population mixing has decreased considerably as the pandemic has progressed and are able to measure this effect across the world. Finally, we carry out a counterfactual analysis of delaying the lockdown and show that a one week delay would have doubled the reported number of cases in the US and India. To our knowledge, this work is the first to model in near real-time, the interplay of human mobility, epidemic dynamics and public policies across multiple spatial resolutions and at a global scale.","Adiga, A.; Wang, L.; Sadilek, A.; Tendulkar, A.; Venkatramanan, S.; Vullikanti, A.; Aggarwal, G.; Talekar, A.; Ben, X.; Chen, J.; Lewis, B.; Swarup, S.; Tambe, M.; Marathe, M.",medRxiv : the preprint server for health sciences,188,14

While research on DFTD has been extensive, little is known about the viruses present in devils, and whether any of these are of potential conservation relevance for this endangered species. Using both metagenomics based on virus-like particle (VLP) enrichment and sequence-independent amplification (VLP metagenomics), and meta-transcriptomics based on bulk RNA sequencing, we characterised and compared the faecal viromes of captive and wild Tasmanian devils. A total of 54 devil faecal samples collected from captive (n = 2) and wild (n = 4) populations were processed for virome characterisation using both approaches. We detected many novel, highly divergent viruses, including vertebrate viruses, bacteriophage and other dietary associated plant and insect viruses. In total, 18 new vertebrate viruses, including novel sapelovirus, astroviruses, bocaviruses, papillomaviruses and gammaherpesvirus were identified, as well as known mammalian pathogens including rabbit haemorrhagic disease virus 2 (RHDV2). Captive devils showed significantly lower levels of viral diversity than wild devils. Comparison of the two methodological approaches revealed substantial differences in the number and types of viruses detected, with meta-transcriptomics mainly identifying RNA viruses, and VLP metagenomics largely identifying DNA viruses. This study has greatly expanded our knowledge of eukaryotic viruses in the Tasmanian devil and provides important baseline information that will contribute to the conservation and captive management of this endangered species. In addition, our results showed that a combination of VLP metagenomics and meta-transcriptomics may be a more comprehensive approach to virome characterisation than either method alone.","Chong, Rowena; Shi, Mang; Grueber, Catherine E; Holmes, Edward C; Hogg, Carolyn; Belov, Katherine; Barrs, Vanessa R",bioRxiv,188,24

The objective of this review was to synthesise the evidence for the potential airborne transmission of SARS‐CoV‐2 via aerosols. Systematic literature searches were conducted in PubMed, Embase, Europe PMC and National Health Service UK evidence up to 27 July 2020. A protocol was published and Cochrane guidance for rapid review methodology was adhered to throughout. Twenty‐eight studies were identified. Seven out of eight epidemiological studies suggest aerosol transmission may occur, with enclosed environments and poor ventilation noted as possible contextual factors. Ten of the 16 air sampling studies detected SARS‐CoV‐2 ribonucleic acid; however, only three of these studies attempted to culture the virus with one being successful in a limited number of samples. Two of four virological studies using artificially generated aerosols indicated that SARS‐CoV‐2 is viable in aerosols. The results of this review indicate there is inconclusive evidence regarding the viability and infectivity of SARS‐CoV‐2 in aerosols. Epidemiological studies suggest possible transmission, with contextual factors noted. Viral particles have been detected in air sampling studies with some evidence of clinical infectivity, and virological studies indicate these particles may represent live virus, adding further plausibility. However, there is uncertainty as to the nature and impact of aerosol transmission of SARS‐CoV‐2, and its relative contribution to the Covid‐19 pandemic compared with other modes of transmission.","Comber, Laura; O Murchu, Eamon; Drummond, Linda; Carty, Paul G.; Walsh, Kieran A.; De Gascun, Cillian F.; Connolly, Máire A.; Smith, Susan M.; O'Neill, Michelle; Ryan, Máirín; Harrington, Patricia",Rev Med Virol,188,0

Regarding viruses, they have historically been responsible for many deaths, and such a peculiarity occurs because they are known to be obligate intracellular parasites that depend upon the host's cell machinery for their replication. Successful infection with the production of essential viral components requires constant viral evolution as a strategy to manipulate the cellular environment, including host internal factors, the host's nonspecific and adaptive immune responses to viruses, the metabolic and energetic state of the infected cell, and changes in the intracellular redox environment during the viral infection cycle. Based on this knowledge, it is fundamental to develop new therapeutic strategies for controlling viral dissemination, by means of antiviral therapies, vaccines, or antioxidants, or by targeting the inhibition or activation of cell signaling pathways or metabolic pathways that are altered during infection. The rapid recovery of altered cellular homeostasis during viral infection is still a major challenge. Here, we review the strategies by which viruses evade the host's immune response and potential tools used to develop more specific antiviral therapies to cure, control, or prevent viral diseases.","Strumillo, Scheilla T.; Kartavykh, Denis; de Carvalho , Fábio F.; Cruz, Nicolly C.; de Souza Teodoro, Ana C.; Sobhie Diaz, Ricardo; Curcio, Marli F.",Cell Biol Int,188,22

Infection can result in a wide range of clinical outcomes, from an asymptomatic condition to severe bilateral pneumonia and life-threatening conditions. Diagnosis is based on the combination of a history of exposure, clinical presentation, and real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assays. In endemic areas, imaging tests including computed tomography (CT), chest X-ray (CXR), and ultrasound (US) have been included in the diagnostic workup. Multiple and peripheral areas of parenchymal injury is the hallmark of COVID-19 lung infection, seen as ground-glass opacification and consolidation on CT, as hazy opacities on CXR, and as multiple B-lines and subpleural consolidations on US. Of these modalities, CT has the best sensitivity and specificity, while CXR has moderate sensitivity and unknown specificity. Both CT and CXR involve ionizing radiation, increase the risk of cross-infection, and require a long sterilization time. Ultrasound is the only modality used by clinicians. Early reports have shown promising results, comparable to CT. With high availability, the lowest risk of cross-infection, and a rapid sterilization process, US may potentially become the primary imaging tool for COVID-19 pulmonary injury. Lung US training programs are needed to provide clinicians with the ability to better implement this technique.","Ilivitzki, Anat; Rinnot, Bar; Glozman, Luda",Rambam Maimonides Med J,188,1

While a few studies in the literature discuss the choice of delivery in remote areas of minority ethnic groups; our work aims to identify factors that indicated their delivery place, at home or in the health facilities. METHODS: A community-based qualitative study was conducted between February and March 2020. Three types of interviews were implemented, In-depth interviews with 16 women of eight rural villages who delivered in the last 12 months in Xepon District, Savannakhet Province, Lao PDR. Also, three focus group discussions (FGDs) with nine HCPs and key-informant interviews of ten VHVs were managed. Factors affecting the choice of the delivery place were categorized according to the social-ecological model. RESULTS: Our sample included five Tri women and two Mangkong women in the HD group, while the FD group included three Tri women, two Mangkong women, one Phoutai woman, two Laolung women and one Vietnamese. Our investigation inside the targeted minority showed that both positive perceptions of home delivery (HD) and low-risk perception minorities were the main reasons for the choice of HD, on the individual level. On the other hand, fear of complication, the experience of stillbirth, and prolonged labour pain during HD were reasons for facility-based delivery (FD). Notably, the women in our minority reported no link between their preference and their language, while the HCPs dated the low knowledge to the language barrier. On the interpersonal level, the FD women had better communication with their families, and better preparation for delivery compared to the HD group. The FD family prepared cash and transportation using their social network. At the community level, the trend of the delivery place had shifted from HD to FD. Improved accessibility and increased knowledge through community health education were the factors of the trend. At the societal (national policy) level, the free delivery policy and limitation of HCPs’ assisted childbirth only in health facilities were the factors of increasing FD, while the absence of other incentives like transportation and food allowance was the factor of remaining of HD. CONCLUSIONS: Based on the main findings of this study, we urge the enhancement of family communication on birth preparedness and birthplace. Furthermore, our findings support the need to educate mothers, especially those of younger ages, about their best options regarding the place of delivery. We propose implementing secondary services of HD to minimize the emergency risks of HD. We encourage local authorities to be aware of the medical needs of the community especially those of pregnant females and their right for a free delivery policy.","Kawaguchi, Yoshiko; Sayed, Ahmad M.; Shafi, Alliya; Kounnavong, Sengchanh; Pongvongsa, Tiengkham; Lasaphonh, Angkhana; Xaylovong, Khamsamay; Sato, Miho; Matsui, Mitsuaki; Imoto, Atsuko; Huy, Nguyen Tien; Moji, Kazuhiko",PLoS One,188,1

We introduced Wimley–White membrane-water partitioning free energies of the amino acids as an algorithm for predicting functional domains that may transmit protein conformational energy into membranes. It was found that many viral products possess unusually extended, aromatic-rich pre-transmembrane stretches predicted to stably reside at the membrane interface. Here, we review structure–function studies, as well as data reported on the interaction of representative peptides with model membranes, all of which sustain a functional role for these domains in viral fusion and fission.

Although the intranasal route is efficient to deliver native rhCAT to the lung, the therapeutic effect is limited by rapid elimination from the blood. In this study, we modified rhCAT with the active polymer, polyethylene glycol monomethyl ether (PEG)-5000, and analyzed the pharmacokinetics of PEGylated rhCAT in mice. The high tetra-PEGylation ratio was about 60 %, and PEGylation prolonged the half-life of rhCAT in serum (75 vs. 13.5 min for native rhCAT). The protective effects of PEG-rhCAT were investigated in a mouse model of influenza virus A (H1N1)-associated pneumonia. PEG-rhCAT was more effectively delivered than native rhCAT and was associated with higher survival ratio, less extensive lung injuries, reduced ROS levels, and lower viral replication. Collectively, these findings indicate that PEGylation can enhance the therapeutic efficacy of native rhCAT and suggest that PEGylated rhCAT may represent a novel complement therapy for H1N1 influenza-induced pneumonia.

This pandemic coronavirus strain has taken scientists and public health researchers by surprise and knowledge of its basic biology (e.g. structure/function relationships in its genomic, messenger and template RNAs) and modes for therapeutic intervention lag behind that of other human pathogens. In this report we used a recently-developed bioinformatics approach, ScanFold, to deduce the RNA structural landscape of the SARS-CoV-2 transcriptome. We recapitulate known elements of RNA structure and provide a model for the folding of an essential frameshift signal. Our results find that the SARS-CoV-2 is greatly enriched in unusually stable and likely evolutionarily ordered RNA structure, which provides a huge reservoir of potential drug targets for RNA-binding small molecules. Our results also predict regions that are accessible for intermolecular interactions, which can aid in the design of antisense therapeutics. All results are made available via a public database (the RNAStructuromeDB) where they may hopefully drive drug discovery efforts to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis.","Andrews, Ryan J.; Peterson, Jake M.; Haniff, Hafeez S.; Chen, Jonathan; Williams, Christopher; Grefe, Maison; Disney, Matthew D.; Moss, Walter N.",bioRxiv,188,14

BASIGIN controls tumour metabolism, particularly glycolysis by facilitating lactic acid export through the two monocarboxylate transporters MCT1 and hypoxia-inducible MCT4. However, before being recognized as a co-carrier of MCTs, BASIGIN was described as an inducer of extracellular matrix metalloproteases (MMPs). Early on, a model emerged in which, tumour cells use the extracellular domain of BASIGIN to recognize and stimulate neighbouring fibroblasts to produce MMPs. However, this model has remained hypothetical since a direct link between BASIGIN and MMPs production has not yet been clearly established. To validate the BASIGIN/MMP hypothesis, we developed BASIGIN knockouts in three human tumour cell lines derived from glioma, colon, and lung adenocarcinoma. By using co-culture experiments of either human or mouse fibroblasts and tumour cell lines we showed, contrary to what has been abundantly published, that the disruption of BASIGIN in tumour cells and in MEFs has no action on the production of MMPs. Our findings do not support the notion that the pro-tumoural action of BASIGIN is mediated via induction of MMPs. Therefore, we propose that to date, the strongest pro-tumoural action of BASIGIN is mediated through the control of fermentative glycolysis.","Marchiq, Ibtissam; Albrengues, Jean; Granja, Sara; Gaggioli, Cédric; Pouysségur, Jacques; Simon, Marie-Pierre",Oncotarget,188,16

Therefore, this study aimed to assess the total proportion of the Bangladeshi population who has adequate knowledge and attitude towards COVID-19 risk of infections and vaccination during Ramadan fasting. A cross-sectional study had conducted among 502 adult participants of Bangladesh. We have used a structured questionnaire which had implemented through a face-to-face interview by trained data collectors. Data were analyzed using statistical package software SPSS version 25.0. Of the 502 participants, 50.2% were male, and most (49.6%) lived in urban areas. About 72.5% and 76.30% reported having adequate knowledge and a positive attitude, respectively, regarding COVID-19 risk of infection and vaccination during Ramadan fasting. Among all variables, no formal education and up to class 8 education had significantly associated with inadequate knowledge (OR = 5.14, 95% CI = 1.63–16.19, and OR = 6.42, 95% CI = 2.55–16.19). Educational status was also associated with attitude (OR = 3.68, 95%CI = 1.17–11.55). Current smokers reported a negative attitude in comparison to non-smokers (OR = 2.48, 95% CI = 1.36–4.50). In conclusion, our study found overall moderate knowledge and attitude among the Bangladeshi population towards COVID-19 infection and vaccination.

However, the number of CTs performed in persons under investigation (PUI) for COVID-19 has increased. We also anticipate that some patients will have incidentally detected findings that could be attributable to COVID-19 pneumonia, requiring radiologists to decide whether or not to mention COVID-19 specifically as a differential diagnostic possibility. We aim to provide guidance to radiologists in reporting CT findings potentially attributable to COVID-19 pneumonia, including standardized language to reduce reporting variability when addressing the possibility of COVID-19. When typical or indeterminate features of COVID-19 pneumonia are present in endemic areas as an incidental finding, we recommend contacting the referring providers to discuss the likelihood of viral infection. These incidental findings do not necessarily need to be reported as COVID-19 pneumonia. In this setting, using the term “viral pneumonia” can be a reasonable and inclusive alternative. However, if one opts to use the term “COVID-19” in the incidental setting, consider the provided standardized reporting language. In addition, practice patterns may vary, and this document is meant to serve as a guide. Consultation with clinical colleagues at each institution is suggested to establish a consensus reporting approach.

Our knowledge of these aerosol constituents is sparse and gleaned from case reports and poorly controlled studies. Therefore, we tracked the origins of microbiota in aerosols generated during ultrasonic scaling, implant osteotomy, and restorative procedures by combining reverse transcriptase quantitative polymerase chain reaction (to identify and quantify SARS-CoV-2) and 16S sequencing (to characterize the entire microbiome) with fine-scale enumeration and source tracking. Linear discriminant analysis of Bray-Curtis dissimilarity distances revealed significant class separation between the salivary microbiome and aerosol microbiota deposited on the operator, patient, assistant, or the environment (P < 0.01, analysis of similarities). We also discovered that 78% of the microbiota in condensate could be traced to the dental irrigant, while saliva contributed to a median of 0% of aerosol microbiota. We also identified low copy numbers of SARS-CoV-2 virus in the saliva of several asymptomatic patients but none in aerosols generated from these patients. Together, the bacterial and viral data encourage us to conclude that when infection control measures are used, such as preoperative mouth rinses and intraoral high-volume evacuation, dental treatment is not a factor in increasing the risk for transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in asymptomatic patients and that standard infection control practices are sufficiently capable of protecting personnel and patients from exposure to potential pathogens. This information is of immediate urgency, not only for safe resumption of dental treatment during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, but also to inform evidence-based selection of personal protection equipment and infection control practices at a time when resources are stretched and personal protection equipment needs to be prioritized.","Meethil, A.P.; Saraswat, S.; Chaudhary, P.P.; Dabdoub, S.M.; Kumar, P.S.",J Dent Res,188,0

Management of risk in care homes requires good evidence on the most important transmission pathways. One hypothesised route at the start of the pandemic, prior to widespread testing, was transfer of patients from hospitals, which were experiencing high levels of nosocomial events. Methods We tested the hypothesis that hospital discharge events increased the intensity of care home cases using a national individually linked health record cohort in Wales, UK. We monitored 186,772 hospital discharge events over the period March to July 2020, tracking individuals to 923 care homes and recording the daily case rate in the homes populated by 15,772 residents. We estimated the risk of an increase in cases rates following exposure to a hospital discharge using multi-level hierarchical logistic regression, and a novel stochastic Hawkes process outbreak model. Findings In regression analysis, after adjusting for care home size, we found no significant association between hospital discharge and subsequent increases in care home case numbers (odds ratio: 0.99, 95% CI 0.82, 1.90). Risk factors for increased cases included care home size, care home resident density, and provision of nursing care. Using our outbreak model, we found a significant effect of hospital discharge on the subsequent intensity of cases. However, the effect was small, and considerably less than the effect of care home size, suggesting the highest risk of introduction came from interaction with the community. We estimated approximately 1.8% of hospital discharged patients may have been infected. Interpretation There is growing evidence in the UK that the risk of transfer of COVID-19 from the high-risk hospital setting to the high-risk care home setting during the early stages of the pandemic was relatively small. Although access to testing was limited to initial symptomatic cases in each care home at this time, our results suggest that reduced numbers of discharges, selection of patients, and action taken within care homes following transfer all may have contributed to mitigation. The precise key transmission routes from the community remain to be quantified.","Hollinghurst, J.; North, L.; Emmerson, C.; Akbari, A.; Torabi, F.; Lyons, R. A.; Hawkes, A.

Abstract Introduction: The spread of the SARS-CoV-2 infection (COVID-19) has required adaptation by hospitals affected by the pandemic, which has caused a reduction in elective surgical activity. Material and method: Retrospective study of patients operated on in the previous month and during the peak of the pandemic. We analysed the COVID-19 infection rate, the severity of respiratory infection according to the Brescia respiratory COVID-19 severity scale (BRCSS), the adopted therapeutic measures and the overall postoperative complications. Results: From 17th February to 31st March 2020, there was a progressive decrease in surgical activity, with only 213 patients operated on. This comprised 59 (27.8%) elective operations for oncological diseases, 97 (45.5%) elective operations for benign diseases and 57 (26.7%) as urgent procedures. There was a progressive increase in the rate of infection by COVID-19, with a total of 15 cases (7%). This included 10 patients (16.9%) in the elective group for oncological disease, 1 (1%) in the elective surgery group for benign disease and 4 (7%) in the urgent surgery group (p <0.001). Five patients presented with a severe respiratory infection, of which 4 were affected by oncological disease. There were 3 deaths (1.4%), which were all due to the worsening of a respiratory infection. Conclusions: The patients undergoing the surgical procedures showed high rates of COVID-19 infection and postoperative complications, especially the patients with oncological diseases. Local resumption of surgical activity must be based on the prioritisation of the cases to be operated on, respecting certain premises of security and optimisation of the available resources.","Martino, Marcello Di; Septiem, Javier García; González, Rocío Maqueda; de Nova, Jose Luis Muñoz; de la Hoz Rodríguez, Ángela; Bonito, Alba Correa; Martín-Pérez, Elena",Cir Esp,188,16

STUDY DESIGN: We performed a year-long surveillance for RVIs in infants <33 weeks gestational age admitted to two Syracuse neonatal intensive care units (NICUs). Infants were enrolled within 3 days of NICU admission and were sampled for RVIs until discharge using a multiplex PCR assay capable of detecting 17 different respiratory viruses or subtypes. RESULTS: 26 of 50 prematurely born infants (52%) tested positive for a respiratory virus at least once during their birth hospitalization. Testing positive for a respiratory virus was significantly associated with longer length of stay (70 days vs. 35 days, p = 0.002) and prolonged ventilatory support (51 vs. 13 days, p = 0.002). Infants who tested positive for a respiratory virus during their birth hospitalization had more than twice the rate of developing bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD; p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Nosocomial RVIs were frequent in our study population, despite the absence of clinical indicators of illness.

The pathogenic mechanisms that lead to respiratory complications, such as endothelialitis, intussusceptive angiogenesis, and vascular leakage remain unclear. In this study, by using an immunofluorescence assay and in situ RNA-hybridization, we demonstrate the capability of SARS-CoV-2 to infect human primary lung microvascular endothelial cells (HL-mECs) in the absence of cytopathic effects and release of infectious particles. Preliminary data point to the role of integrins in SARS-CoV-2 entry into HL-mECs in the absence of detectable ACE2 expression. Following infection, HL-mECs were found to release a plethora of pro-inflammatory and pro-angiogenic molecules, as assessed by microarray analyses. This conditioned microenvironment stimulated HL-mECs to acquire an angiogenic phenotype. Proteome analysis confirmed a remodeling of SARS-CoV-2-infected HL-mECs to inflammatory and angiogenic responses and highlighted the expression of antiviral molecules as annexin A6 and MX1. These results support the hypothesis of a direct role of SARS-CoV-2-infected HL-mECs in sustaining vascular dysfunction during the early phases of infection.

As the curve progresses and patients are discharged the rehabilitation wave brings a high number of post-acute COVID-19 patients suffering from physical, mental, and cognitive impairments threatening their return to normal life. The complexity and severity of disease in patients recovering from severe COVID-19 infection require an approach that is implemented as early in the recovery phase as possible, in a concerted and systematic way. To address the rehabilitation wave, we describe a spectrum of interventions that start in the ICU and continue through all the appropriate levels of care. This approach requires organized rehabilitation teams including physical therapists, occupational therapists, speech-language pathologists, rehabilitation psychologists/neuropsychologists, and physiatrists collaborating with acute medical teams. Here, we also discuss administrative factors that influence the provision of care during the COVID-19 pandemic. The services that can be provided are described in detail to allow the reader to understand what services may be appropriate locally.

Because standard medical treatments are not highly efficacious in resolving the accompanying middle ear (ME) inflammation, a goal of current research is OM prevention. Past studies show that new episodes of OM are usually a complication of viral upper respiratory infection (vURI), and therefore, a rational approach to achieving that goal is to develop intervention strategies that target vURIassociated OM. However, past experiences with antibiotics show that, in the absence of well-defined treatment protocols that maximize expected efficacy, the adoption of prophylactic or active treatments for OM can have negative consequences for the patient and for the general population. In this review, we discuss the hypothesized mechanisms by which a vURI is translated into an acute OM episode and describe different strategies for aborting that process.

For this reason, the disposal and recycling of these wastes has become a key issue to be resolved. With the growing attention of the circular economy, the exploitation of underused or discarded marine material can represent a sustainable strategy for the realization of a circular bioeconomy, with the production of materials with high added value.

So far as this reactive response becomes exacerbated and uncontrolled, it can lead to neurodegeneration, compromising the cognitive and neuropsychiatric domains. Parallelly, modifications in the hypothalamic signaling of neuroprotective hormones linked also to the inflammatory responses of microglia and astrocytes can exacerbate these processes. To complicate the picture, modulations in the gut microbiota (GM) can induce changes in neuroinflammation, altering cognitive and neuropsychiatric functioning. We conducted a web-based search on PubMed. We described studies regarding the cross-talk among microglia and astrocytes in the neuroinflammation processes, along with the role played by the steroid hormones, and how this can reflect on cognitive decline/neurodegeneration, in particular on Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) and its neuropsychiatric manifestations. We propose and support the huge literature showing the potentiality of complementary/alternative therapeutic approaches (nutraceuticals) targeting the sustained inflammatory response, the dysregulation of hypothalamic system and the GM composition. NF-κB and Keap1/Nrf2 are the main molecular targets on which a list of nutraceuticals can modulate the altered processes. Since there are some limitations, we propose a new intervention natural treatment in terms of Oxygen-ozone (O(2)-O(3)) therapy that could be potentially used for AD pathology. Through a meta-analytic approach, we found a significant modulation of O(3) on inflammation-NF-κB/NLRP3 inflammasome/Toll-Like Receptor 4 (TLR4)/Interleukin IL-17α signalling, reducing mRNA (p<0.00001 Odd Ratio (OR)=-5.25 95% CI:-7.04/-3.46) and protein (p<0.00001 OR=-4.85 95%CI:-6.89/-2.81) levels, as well as on Keap1/Nrf2 pathway. Through anti-inflammatory, immune, and steroid hormones modulation and anti-microbial activities, O(3) at mild therapeutic concentrations potentiated with nutraceuticals and GM regulators could determine combinatorial effects impacting on cognitive and neurodegenerative domains, neuroinflammation and neuroendocrine signalling, directly or indirectly through the mediation of GM.","Scassellati, Catia; Galoforo, Antonio Carlo; Esposito, Ciro; Ciani, Miriam; Ricevuti, Giovanni; Bonvicini, Cristian",Aging Dis,188,21

The latest EF calculation method is used to determine the conversion rates and equivalent factors of bioproductive lands in each year to establish a database of Taiwan’s EF in that period. The results reveal that Taiwan’s EF was 7.69 gha/person in 2000, dropping steadily to 6.46 gha/person in 2018. Taiwan’s carbon footprint accounted for about 61% of Taiwan’s total EF, slightly higher than the world average (60%). The carbon footprint as a proportion of the total EF has been increasing annually. This study adopts social communication tools, such as the overshoot day and the earth clock, to promote sustainable development goals and climate change policy initiatives. Global Footprint Network (GFN) updates the overshoot day of each country in its database yearly, based on each country’s EF and biocapacity. Since Taiwan is not included in GFN, this study adopts the same method and finds out that Taiwan's Overshoot Day in 2018 was March 14th, meaning that on March 14th, 2018, Taiwan exhausted all of the biological resources that its bioproductive lands can regenerate in the year. If the global population lived like Taiwanese, four Earths would be required to provide the resources used. This result not only reflects the consumption of natural resources in Taiwan, but also indicates that Taiwan should focus on sustainable development and reduce that consumption.","Lee, Yung-Jaan; Chai, Lei; Wu, Po-Shu",Sci Rep,188,8

The purpose of this study was to examine how adolescent PA changed during school closures, to identify the key barriers and facilitators for these changes during lockdown and to use this information to understand how to manage future crises’ situations positively to prevent physical inactivity. METHODS: Irish adolescents (N=1214; ages 12–18 years) participated in an online cross-sectional study during April 2020, including items on PA level, changes in PA and reasons for change in an open-ended format. Numeric analyses were through multiple binary logistic regressions, stratified by changes in PA during lockdown and inductive analysis of open coding of text responses. RESULTS: Adolescents reported they did less PA (50%), no change (30%) or did more PA during lockdown (20%). Adolescents who did less PA were more likely to be overweight (OR=1.8, CI=1.2–2.7) or obese (OR=2.2, CI=1.2–4.0) and less likely to have strong prior PA habits (OR=0.4, CI=0.2–0.6). The most cited barriers to PA were coronavirus, club training cancelled and time. Strong associations for doing more PA included participation in strengthening exercises at least three times in the past 7 days (OR=1.7, CI=1.3–2.4); facilitators were more time, coronavirus and no school. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 restrictions were both a barrier to and an opportunity for PA.

The fatality trajectory represented by this trend line can be projected from the number of daily infections by assuming a time lapse between symptom onset and death between 17 and 19 days and a nominal time-dependent fatality rate. The time trajectory of this fatality rate suggests a change of the infection dynamics at April 3, with an increase from 2.5% to 6% within 20 days perhaps indicating spread of infection to more vulnerable people. Later in summer, the nominal fatality rate decreases down to 1% in mid-July raising the question whether Covid-19 is intrinsically less lethal in summer. Although the time trajectories of infections and fatality are pronouncedly different, the reproduction rates obtained therefrom are similar indicating that the infection dynamics may reasonably well be deduced from the potentially biased reported infection rate if it is biased consistently, i.e. the same way, over an extended period of time. The administrative measures to contain the pandemic seem not to have an immediate effect on the infection dynamics but well the ease of restrictions.

The basic reproductive number characterizes the average number of persons that a primary case can directly infect in a population full of susceptible individuals. However, there can be superspreaders that can infect more than this estimated basic reproductive number. In this study, we formulate a conceptual mathematical model on the transmission dynamics of COVID-19 between the frontliners and the general public. We assume that the general public has a reproductive number between 1.5 to 4, and frontliners (e.g. healthcare workers, customer service and retail personnel, food service crews, and transport or delivery workers) have a higher reproduction number. Our simulations show that both the frontliners and the general public should be protected or resilient against the disease. Protecting only the frontliners will not result in flattening the epidemic curve. Protecting only the general public may flatten the epidemic curve but the infection risk faced by the frontliners is still high, which may eventually affect their work. Our simple model does not consider all factors involved in COVID-19 transmission in a community, but the insights from our model results remind us of the importance of community effort in controlling the transmission of the disease.

The most common features are purported to be fever and a new persistent cough, although the global prevalence of these symptoms remains unclear. The aim of this systematic review is to determine the prevalence of symptoms associated with COVID-19 worldwide. METHODS: We searched PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, AMED, medRxiv and bioRxiv on 5(th) April 2020 for studies of adults (>16 years) with laboratory test confirmed COVID-19. No language or publication status restrictions were applied. Data were independently extracted by two review authors into standardised forms. All datapoints were independently checked by three other review authors. A random-effects model for pooling of binomial data was applied to estimate the prevalence of symptoms, subgrouping estimates by country. I(2) was used to assess inter-study heterogeneity. RESULTS: Of 851 unique citations, 148 articles were included which comprised 24,410 adults with confirmed COVID-19 from 9 countries. The most prevalent symptoms were fever (78% [95% CI 75%-81%]; 138 studies, 21,701 patients; I(2) 94%), a cough (57% [95% CI 54%-60%]; 138 studies, 21,682 patients; I(2) 94%) and fatigue (31% [95% CI 27%-35%]; 78 studies, 13,385 patients; I(2) 95%). Overall, 19% of hospitalised patients required non-invasive ventilation (44 studies, 6,513 patients), 17% required intensive care (33 studies, 7504 patients), 9% required invasive ventilation (45 studies, 6933 patients) and 2% required extra-corporeal membrane oxygenation (12 studies, 1,486 patients). The mortality rate was 7% (73 studies, 10,402 patients). CONCLUSIONS: We confirm that fever and cough are the most prevalent symptoms of adults infected by SARS-CoV-2.

Monthly data from January 1, 2005 to September 30, 2009 were analyzed. Spearman correlation and cross-correlation analyses were performed to identify the correlation between each independent variable, ED revenue, and visitor volume. Autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model was used to quantify the relationship between each independent variable, ED revenue, and visitor volume. The accuracies were evaluated by comparing model forecasts to actual values with mean absolute percentage of error. Sensitivity of prediction errors to model training time was also evaluated. The ARIMA models indicated that mean maximum temperature, relative humidity, rainfall, non-trauma, and trauma visits may correlate positively with ED revenue, but mean minimum temperature may correlate negatively with ED revenue. Moreover, mean minimum temperature and stock market index fluctuation may correlate positively with trauma visitor volume. Mean maximum temperature, relative humidity and stock market index fluctuation may correlate positively with non-trauma visitor volume. Mean maximum temperature and relative humidity may correlate positively with pediatric visitor volume, but mean minimum temperature may correlate negatively with pediatric visitor volume.

DESIGN: Semi-structured interviews, video diaries, drawings, and a questionnaire were used to collect data. The study used a narrative perspective and thematic analysis to analyze data. RESULTS: The findings from children and their parents (N = 25) indicated DTGA is disconcerting from both views. Parental guilt and the desire of both parents and children to not have to go through the experience again fueled at least short-term compliance with brushing, flossing, and changes in dietary habits. CONCLUSION: The children participants provided valuable information to augment that gathered from parents. As the study revealed that the DTGA is psychologically and emotionally troubling for both children and their caregivers, it is imperative to explore ways to ease the GA experience. Specific recommendations were provided for optimizing dental and health services for those children and their families.","Baghdadi, Z. D.; Jbara, S.; Muhajarine, N.",Eur Arch Paediatr Dent,188,11

METHODS: Retrospective study in 288 primary care practices (PCP) of the Catalan Institute of Health. We analysed the results of 34 indicators of the Healthcare quality standard (EQA), comprising different types: treatment (4), follow-up (5), control (10), screening (7), vaccinations (4) and quaternary prevention (4). For each PCP, we calculated each indicator’s percentage of change in February, March and April 2020 respective to the results of the previous month; and used the T-Student test for paired data to compare them with the percentage of change in the same month of the previous year. We defined indicators with a negative effect those with a greater negative change or a lesser positive change in 2020 in comparison to 2019; and indicators with a positive effect those with a greater positive change or a lesser negative change. RESULTS: We observed a negative effect on 85% of the EQA indicators in March and 68% in April. 90% of the control indicators had a negative effect, highlighting the control of LDL cholesterol with a reduction of − 2.69% (95%CI − 3.17% to − 2.23%) in March and − 3.41% (95%CI − 3.82% to − 3.01%) in April; and the control of blood pressure with a reduction of − 2.13% (95%CI − 2.34% to − 1.9%) and − 2.59% (95%CI − 2.8% to − 2.37%). The indicators with the greatest negative effect were those of screening, such as the indicator of diabetic foot screening with a negative effect of − 2.86% (95%CI − 3.33% to − 2.39%) and − 4.13% (95%CI − 4.55% to − 3.71%) in March and April, respectively. Only one vaccination indicator, adult Measles-Mumps-Rubella vaccine, had a negative effect in both months. Finally, among the indicators of quaternary prevention, we observed negative effects in March and April although in that case a lower inadequacy that means better clinical outcome. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 epidemic and the lockdown measures have significantly reduced the results of the follow-up, control, screening and vaccination indicators for patients in primary care. On the other hand, the indicators for quaternary prevention have been strengthened and their results have improved.","Coma, Ermengol; Mora, Núria; Méndez, Leonardo; Benítez, Mència; Hermosilla, Eduardo; Fàbregas, Mireia; Fina, Francesc; Mercadé, Albert; Flayeh, Souhel; Guiriguet, Carolina; Balló, Elisabet; Martinez Leon, Nuria; Mas, Ariadna; Cordomí, Sílvia; Lejardi, Yolanda; Medina, Manuel",BMC Fam Pract,188,20

Lack of locally available medical infrastructure, socioeconomic barriers, social marginalization, poor health literacy, and cultural barriers prevent patients from accessing surgical and rehabilitative care. Overcoming these barriers is an insurmountable challenge for the most vulnerable and marginalized, resulting in absence of treatment or even death. METHODS: Sundar Dhoka Saathi Sewa (SDSS), a non-government organization, provides a patient navigation service which facilitates referrals to tertiary centers from Nepal’s most remote areas. Specific criteria ensure that patient referrals are appropriate in regard to clinical and socioeconomic need, while comprehensive counselling helps guide the patient and family. The SDSS staff meet patients upon arrival in Kathmandu and facilitate admission to the appropriate tertiary hospital. They advocate for the patient, provide medicine, supply food and cover all treatment costs. RESULTS: This project has enabled access to treatment for more than 1200 children for conditions leading to long-term disability and/or congenital heart disease. Interventions include a wide range of surgical and rehabilitative procedures such as complex orthopedics, cleft lip and palate, congenital talipes equinovarus, burn contractures, neurological cases, and cardiac surgery for valvular disease, septal defects and other congenital malformations. DISCUSSION: The SDSS model of patient navigation is effective in overcoming the barriers to access surgical care and rehabilitation in Nepal. The success is owed to committed international donors, capacity building, effective counselling, advocacy, compassion, and community. We believe that this model could be replicated in other LMICs.","Ibbotson, Jennifer L.; Luitel, Bijata; Adhikari, Bikash; Jagt, Kathryn R.; Bohler, Erik; Riviello, Robert; Ibbotson, Geoffrey C.",World J Surg,188,3

Here, we describe the integration of nine videos into a large‐enrollment (n = 356) introductory evolution and ecology course via weekly homework assignments. We predicted that videos that feature research stories from contemporary scientists could reinforce topics introduced in lecture and provide students with novel insights into the nature of scientific research. Using qualitative analysis of open‐ended written feedback from the students on each video assigned throughout the term (n = 133–229 responses per video) and on end‐of‐quarter evaluations (n = 243), we identified common categories of student perspectives. All videos received more positive than negative comments and all videos received comments indicating that students found them intellectually and emotionally stimulating, accessible, and relevant to course content. Additionally, all videos also received comments indicating some students found them intellectually unstimulating, though these comments were generally far less numerous than positive comments. Students responded positively to videos that incorporated at least one of the following: documentary‐style filming, very clear links to course content (especially hands‐on activities completed by the students), relevance to recent world events, clarity on difficult topics, and/or charismatic narrators or species.

Methods: Using an online survey, knowledge of Australian COVID‐19 guidelines, concerns about pandemic impact, the practice of preventive behaviours, and sociodemographic variables (i.e. age, gender, information source) were measured. Bivariate analysis and linear regression models were used. Results: A total of 1,491 participants (age 50.5 ±14.9 years, 32.3% males) completed the survey. Higher knowledge and concern scores were associated with a higher practice of preventive behaviour scores (βs:0.47 & 0.08 respectively, p<0.001). Older adults (>65 years) and women had higher knowledge and practice scores compared to their counterparts. Being younger (<45 years) and male were associated with a lower practice score (βs:‐0.88 & −2.52, respectively, p<0.001). Referring to public and government sources as primary sources of information was associated with a higher practice score (β:1.21, p<0.001). Conclusions: Government‐run campaigns appear to be effective in promoting preventive practices and achieving a high knowledge of COVID‐19 guidelines in Australian adults. Implications for public health: Public health strategies are required to promote the practice of preventive behaviour for COVID‐19 (or future pandemics), especially among men and younger adults using social media, given their wide use of these sources.","Khalesi, Saman; Vandelanotte, Corneel; Thwaite, Tanya L.; Alley, Stephanie J.; Williams, Susan L.; To, Quyen G.; Fenning, Andrew S.; Stanton, Robert",Aust N Z J Public Health,188,26

This systematic review synthesized the literature on mental health interventions for PLWH in low‐ and middle‐income countries (LMICs) to determine intervention components and explore their relationship with intervention effectiveness. METHODS: We included only controlled clinical trials of interventions aiming to improve the mental health of PLWH. We conducted a search in the following databases: PubMed, CINAHL, PsycINFO and EMBASE for eligible studies describing the evaluation of interventions for mental health problems among PLWH in LMICs published through August 2020. Two reviewers independently screened references in two successive stages of title/abstract screening and then full‐text screening for references meeting title/abstract criteria. RESULTS: We identified a total of 30 eligible articles representing 6477 PLWH who were assigned to either the intervention arm (n = 3182) or control arm (n = 3346). The mental health interventions evaluated were psychological (n = 17, 56.67%), pharmacological (n = 6, 20.00%), combined psychological and pharmacological (n = 1, 3.33%) and complementary/alternative treatments (n = 6, 20.00%). The mental health problems targeted were depression (n = 22, 73.33 %), multiple psychological symptoms (n = 1, 3.33%), alcohol and substance use problems (n = 4, 13.33%), post‐traumatic stress disorder (n = 1, 3.33%) and HIV‐related neuro‐cognitive impairment (n = 2, 6.67%). Studies of interventions with significant effects had significantly a higher number of active ingredients than those without significant effects [3.41 (2.24) vs. 1.84 (1.46) Mean (SD)] [Mean difference = −1.56, 95% CI = −3.03 to −0.09, p = 0.037]. CONCLUSIONS: There continue to be advances in mental health interventions for PLWH with mental illness in LMICs. However, more research is needed to elucidate how intervention components lead to intervention effectiveness. We recommend scale up of culturally appropriate interventions that have been successfully evaluated in low‐ and middle‐income countries.","Nakimuli‐Mpungu, Etheldreda; Musisi, Seggane; Smith, Colin M; Von Isenburg, Megan; Akimana, Benedict; Shakarishvili, Ani; Nachega, Jean B; Mills, Edward J; Chibanda, Dixon; Ribeiro, Marcelo; V Williams, Anna; Joska, John A",J Int AIDS Soc,188,24

Such facemasks are required to be worn by healthcare professionals when performing aerosol-generating procedures on COVID-19 patients. In response to the high demand and short supply, we designed three models of facemasks that are suitable for local production. As these facemasks should meet the requirements of an FFP2-certified facemask, the newly-designed facemasks were tested on the filtration efficiency of the filter material, inward leakage, and breathing resistance with custom-made experimental setups. In these tests, the locally-produced facemasks were benchmarked against a commercial FFP2 facemask. Furthermore, the protective capacity of the facemasks was tested for the first time with coronavirus-loaded aerosols under physiologically relevant conditions. This multidisciplinary effort resulted in the design and production of facemasks that meet the FFP2 requirements, and which can be mass-produced at local production facilities.","Boogaard, Bob; Nijssen, Joep; Broeren, Freek; Dobbelsteen, John van den; Verhoeven, Vincent; Pluim, Jip; Dekker, Sing; Snijder, Eric; Hemert, Martijn van; Herfst, Sander",,188,1

Their purpose is to deliver a number of policy goals set out in The NHS Long Term Plan. Clinical commissioning groups (CCGs) have a role in their establishment, support, and oversight. AIM: To explore commissioners’ perspectives on the early development of PCNs. DESIGN AND SETTING: Qualitative study of CCG staff using telephone interviews. METHOD: Semi-structured interviews were carried out with 37 CCG employees involved in PCN establishment. Interviewees were asked about local PCNs’ characteristics, factors shaping development and form, activities to date, challenges and benefits, and their CCGs’ relationship with PCNs. Interviewee responses were summarised within a matrix and analysed thematically. RESULTS: Three meta-themes were identified: the multifaceted role of the commissioner, tensions between PCN policy and locally commissioned services, and engaging the broader system. Interviewees reported that the policy potentially favours those PCNs working from a ‘blank slate’ and does not sufficiently account for the fact some GP practices and wider system organisations have been doing similar work already. The prescriptive, contractual nature of the policy has led to local challenges, trying to ensure that local good practices are not lost during implementation. Interviewees also considered an important part of their work to be protecting PCNs from the weight of expectations placed on them. CONCLUSION: CCGs are well placed to understand the complexities of local systems and to facilitate PCNs and working practices between wider system partners. It is important that this local role is not lost as CCGs continue to merge and cover larger geographical populations.","Warwick-Giles, Lynsey; Hammond, Jonathan; Bailey, Simon; Checkland, Kath",British Journal of General Practice,188,22

METHODS: We conducted an observational cohort study of all pregnant patients with a singleton gestation and a positive test result for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) who delivered at 1 of 33 U.S. hospitals in 14 states from March 1 to July 31, 2020. Disease severity was classified by National Institutes of Health criteria. Maternal, fetal, and neonatal outcomes were abstracted by centrally trained and certified perinatal research staff. We evaluated trends in maternal characteristics and outcomes across COVID-19 severity classes and associations between severity and outcomes by multivariable modeling. RESULTS: A total of 1,219 patients were included: 47% asymptomatic, 27% mild, 14% moderate, 8% severe, 4% critical. Overall, 53% were Hispanic; there was no trend in race–ethnicity distribution by disease severity. Those with more severe illness had older mean age, higher median body mass index, and pre-existing medical comorbidities. Four maternal deaths (0.3%) were attributed to COVID-19. Frequency of perinatal death or a positive neonatal SARS-CoV-2 test result did not differ by severity. Adverse perinatal outcomes were more frequent among patients with more severe illness, including 6% (95% CI 2–11%) incidence of venous thromboembolism among those with severe–critical illness compared with 0.2% in mild–moderate and 0% in asymptomatic (P<.001 for trend across severity). In adjusted analyses, severe–critical COVID-19 was associated with increased risk of cesarean birth (59.6% vs 34.0%, adjusted relative risk [aRR] 1.57, 95% CI 1.30–1.90), hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (40.4% vs 18.8%, aRR 1.61, 95% CI 1.18–2.20), and preterm birth (41.8% vs 11.9%, aRR 3.53, 95% CI 2.42–5.14) compared with asymptomatic patients.

The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an ongoing global pandemic and wearing face mask is recommended across the globe to break the transmission chain of infection. The masks available in the market are of different types and materials and tend to alter the voice characteristics of the speaker. This can therefore impair optimal communication and the present study is a systematic review exploring the effect of various masks on voice production parameters. STUDY DESIGN: . Systematic review MATERIALS AND METHODS: . The titles and abstracts screening was carried out for the inclusion of articles using eight electronic databases spanning the period from 1(st) January 2020 to 30(th) April 2021. Ten articles (eight published & two in pre-print) that met the inclusion criteria were considered for this systematic review and the pooled age range was 18–69 years. RESULTS: . Three primary studies from the USA, two each from Australia & Italy, one each from Brazil, China, and Germany were found to have investigated the influence of wearing N95, KN95, surgical and fabric masks on voice related measures. The users significantly reported vocal fatigue, discomfort, and also perceived voice problems. Attenuation of speech sound amplitude was highest for the transparent mask followed by cloth mask, N95, KN95, and surgical mask. CONCLUSION: . The World Health Organization (WHO) has been repeatedly endorsing the need to use a face mask in the current COVID-19 pandemic. However, for an unintruded voice production, the surgical mask is recommended for everyone, including healthcare professionals when they are not in close contact with patients, and not involved in aerosol-generating procedures. For teachers, doing direct teaching (offline classes), ‘surgical mask’ can reduce the vocal load of teachers, smoothen the teacher-student interaction and thereby facilitate better learning by the students. Additionally, it would be useful to protect oneself from the risk of developing voice problems by following standard vocal healthcare tips.","Sheela, Shekaraiah; Kiran, Suresh",J Voice,188,16

However, they require good laboratory infrastructure thereby restricting their use to reference laboratories and research studies. Therefore, adopting molecular tools for routine use in malaria endemic countries will require simpler molecular platforms. The recently developed loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) method is relatively simple and can be improved for better use in endemic countries. In this study, we attempted to improve this method for malaria diagnosis by using a simple and portable device capable of performing both the amplification and detection (by fluorescence) of LAMP in one platform. We refer to this as the RealAmp method. METHODOLOGY AND SIGNIFICANT FINDINGS: Published genus-specific primers were used to test the utility of this method. DNA derived from different species of malaria parasites was used for the initial characterization. Clinical samples of P. falciparum were used to determine the sensitivity and specificity of this system compared to microscopy and a nested PCR method. Additionally, directly boiled parasite preparations were compared with a conventional DNA isolation method. The RealAmp method was found to be simple and allowed real-time detection of DNA amplification. The time to amplification varied but was generally less than 60 minutes. All human-infecting Plasmodium species were detected. The sensitivity and specificity of RealAmp in detecting P. falciparum was 96.7% and 91.7% respectively, compared to microscopy and 98.9% and 100% respectively, compared to a standard nested PCR method. In addition, this method consistently detected P. falciparum from directly boiled blood samples. CONCLUSION: This RealAmp method has great potential as a field usable molecular tool for diagnosis of malaria. This tool can provide an alternative to conventional PCR based diagnostic methods for field use in clinical and operational programs.","Lucchi, Naomi W.; Demas, Allison; Narayanan, Jothikumar; Sumari, Deborah; Kabanywanyi, Abdunoor; Kachur, S.

Entry is dependent on proteolytic priming, activation, and receptor binding; all of which can be variable, dependent on context. Here we review the implications of the complexity of SARS-CoV-2 entry pathways on entry assays that then drive our understanding of humoral immunity, therapeutic efficacy, and tissue restriction. We focus especially on the proteolytic activation of SARS-CoV-2 spike and how this constellation of proteases lends deeper insight to our understanding of arising variants and their putative role transmission or variable pathogenicity in vivo. In this review, we argue for better universal standards to assay virus entry as well as suggest best practices for reporting viral passage number, the cell line used, and proteases present, among other important considerations.","Stevens, Christian S; Oguntuyo, Kasopefoluwa Y; Benhur, Lee",Curr Opin Virol,188,20

CASE REPORT: We report the case of a 41-year-old man with ADPKD, secondary arterial hypertension, and stage 4 chronic kidney disease who presented with a 2-week history of persistent pain at the base of the right hemithorax and in the right hypochondrium. An ultrasound examination and a contrast-enhanced computed tomography scan revealed a giant cavernous liver hemangioma. Surgery was intially taken into account (however, twice delayed because of the COVID-19 pandemic) but later refused because it would have left the patient with dangerously few liver parenchyma. CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of ADPKD associated with cavernous liver hemangioma. Vascular endothelial growth factor could be the pathophysiological link between the 2 conditions. Further research may unravel the molecular biology that underlies this possible association, pointing to new therapeutic avenues for ADPKD.","Ghenu, Iuliana Maria; Constantin, Rodica; Ionescu, Dorin; Dragos, Dorin",Am J Case Rep,188,15

We disinfected surfaces contaminated with H1N1 influenza viruses using hydrogen peroxide (HP) vapor at concentrations below 100 ppm and triethylene glycol (TEG)-saturated air containing 2 ppm of TEG at 25°C. METHODS: Influenza viruses in aqueous suspensions were deposited on stainless-steel coupons, allowed to dry at ambient conditions, and then exposed for up to 15 minutes to 10 to 90 ppm of HP vapor or TEG-saturated air. Virus assays were done on the solution used to wash the viruses from these coupons and from coupons treated similarly but without exposure to HP or TEG vapor. RESULTS: After 2.5 minutes, exposure to 10-ppm HP vapor resulted in 99% inactivation. For air saturated with TEG at 25 to 29°C, the disinfection rate was about 1.3 log(10) reductions per hour, about 16 times faster than the measured natural inactivation rate under ambient conditions. CONCLUSIONS: Vapor concentrations of 10 ppm HP or 2 ppm TEG can provide effective surface disinfection. At these low concentrations, the potential for damage to even the avionics of an airplane would be expected to be minimal. At a TEG vapor concentration of 2 ppm, there are essentially no health risks to people.","Rudnick, Stephen N.; McDevitt, James J.; First, Melvin W.; Spengler, John D.",Am J Infect Control,188,24

Initially, patients were redistributed regionally by ground transport. When transport over longer distances became necessary, we initiated a new Helicopter Emergency Medical Service (HEMS) operation. We hypothesize that the transport of contagious COVID-19 patients is feasible and safe for patients and HEMS personnel. METHODS: In this retrospective, single-centre observational study, flight and monitor data were used to calculate the exposure time of the retrieval team to COVID-19 patients. All the crew members (n = 18) were instructed on the proper use of personal protective equipment (PPE), dressing and undressing routine using buddy check supervision and cleaning procedures. All the team members were monitored for possible COVID-19 symptoms, as advised by our National Institute for Health and Environment. One month after completing the aeromedical transport all crew members were asked to donate a blood sample which was examined for the presence of IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV-2. RESULTS: From March 24 to May 25, 2020 the HEMS team transported 67 ventilated critical care COVID-19 patients. The exposure time was 7451 min (124 h and 11 min). One HEMS member reported pneumonia 6 weeks before the start of the patient transport. He tested positive for IgG SARS-CoV-2 by serology testing. We speculate that he was infected before the start of the operation; irrefutable evidence is lacking to support this claim because we did not perform serology testing before this operation started. CONCLUSION: Occupational COVID-19 exposure during helicopter transport of ventilated critical care COVID-19 patients can be performed safely when proper PPE is applied.","Spoelder, Ed J.; Tacken, Marijn C.

In this commentary, methodological challenges and opportunities regarding the links between air pollution and COVID-19 are discussed with a focus on: i) the role of differential exposure to air pollution across populations and explain spatio-temporal variability of the epidemic spread and resultant mortality; ii) the indirect impacts of interventions treated as natural experiments to control COVID-19 person-to-person spread on air pollution and population health. I first discuss the potential mechanisms between exposure to air pollution and COVID-19 and the opportunity to clearly formulate causal questions of interest through the target trial framework. Then, I discuss challenges regarding the use of quasi-experimental designs that capitalize on the differential timing of COVID-19 policies including the selection of control groups and potential violations of the common shock assumption.

On the basis of detailed patient and contact-tracing data in Hunan, China, we find that 80% of secondary infections traced back to 15% of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) primary infections, which indicates substantial transmission heterogeneities. Transmission risk scales positively with the duration of exposure and the closeness of social interactions and is modulated by demographic and clinical factors. The lockdown period increases transmission risk in the family and households, whereas isolation and quarantine reduce risks across all types of contacts. The reconstructed infectiousness profile of a typical SARS-CoV-2 patient peaks just before symptom presentation. Modeling indicates that SARS-CoV-2 control requires the synergistic efforts of case isolation, contact quarantine, and population-level interventions because of the specific transmission kinetics of this virus.","Sun, Kaiyuan; Wang, Wei; Gao, Lidong; Wang, Yan; Luo, Kaiwei; Ren, Lingshuang; Zhan, Zhifei; Chen, Xinghui; Zhao, Shanlu; Huang, Yiwei; Sun, Qianlai; Liu, Ziyan; Litvinova, Maria; Vespignani, Alessandro; Ajelli, Marco; Viboud, Cécile; Yu, Hongjie",Science,188,1

However, understanding which circulating proteins are etiologically involved is difficult because their levels may be influenced by COVID-19 itself and also subject to confounding factors. To identify circulating proteins influencing COVID-19 susceptibility and severity we undertook a large-scale two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) study, since this study design can rapidly scan hundreds of circulating proteins and reduces bias due to confounding and reverse causation. We began by identifying the genetic determinants of 955 circulating proteins in up to 10,708 SARS-CoV-2 uninfected individuals, retaining only single nucleotide polymorphisms near the gene encoded by the circulating protein. We then undertook an MR study to estimate the effect of these proteins on COVID-19 susceptibility and severity using the Host Genetics Initiative. We found that a standard deviation increase in OAS1 levels was associated with reduced COVID-19 death or ventilation (N = 2,972 cases / 284,472 controls; OR = 0.48, P = 7x10-8), COVID-19 hospitalization (N = 6,492 / 1,012,809; OR = 0.60, P = 2x10-7) and COVID-19 susceptibility (N = 17,607 / 1,345,334; OR = 0.81, P = 6x10-5). Results were consistent despite multiple sensitivity analyses probing MR assumptions. OAS1 is an interferon-stimulated gene that promotes viral RNA degradation. Other potentially implicated proteins included IL10RB. Available medicines, such as interferon-beta-1b, increase OAS1 and could be explored for their effect on COVID-19 susceptibility and severity.","Zhou, S.; Butler-Laporte, G.; Nakanishi, T.; Morrison, D.; Afilalo, J.; Afilalo, M.; Kimchi, N.; Afrasiabi, Z.; Rezk, N.; Bouab, M.; Guzman, C.; Petitjean, L.; Xue, X.; Tselios, C.; Vulesevic, B.; Chen, Y.; Mooser, V.; Forgetta, V.; Kaufmann, D.; Richards, B.",,188,26

Health professionals and community residents are main players in disaster responses but their knowledge levels of disaster medicine are not readily available. This study aimed to evaluate knowledge levels and training needs of disaster medicine among potential disaster responders and presented a necessity to popularize disaster medicine education. METHODS: A self-reporting questionnaire survey on knowledge level and training needs of disaster medicine was conducted in Shanghai, China, in 2012. A total of randomly selected 547 health professionals, 456 medical students, and 1,526 local residents provided intact information. The total response rate was 93.7%. RESULTS: Overall, 1.3% of these participants have received systematic disaster medicine training. News media (87.1%) was the most common channel to acquire disaster medicine knowledge. Although health professionals were more knowledgeable than community residents, their knowledge structure of disaster medicine was not intact. Medical teachers were more knowledgeable than medical practitioners and health administrators (p = 0.002). Clinicians performed better than public health physicians (p<0.001), whereas public health students performed better than clinical medical students (p<0.001). In community residents, education background significantly affected the knowledge level on disaster medicine (p<0.001). Training needs of disaster medicine were generally high among the surveyed. ‘Lecture’ and ‘practical training’ were preferred teaching methods. The selected key and interested contents on disaster medicine training were similar between health professionals and medical students, while the priorities chosen by local residents were quite different from health professionals and medical students (p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Traditional clinical-oriented medical education might lead to a huge gap between the knowledge level on disaster medicine and the current needs of disaster preparedness. Continuing medical education and public education plans on disaster medicine via media should be practice-oriented, and selectively applied to different populations and take the knowledge levels and training needs into consideration.","Su, Tong; Han, Xue; Chen, Fei; Du, Yan; Zhang, Hongwei; Yin, Jianhua; Tan, Xiaojie; Chang, Wenjun; Ding, Yibo; Han, Yifang; Cao, Guangwen",PLoS One,188,1

The objectives of this study were (1) to assess the perceptions of healthcare workers (HCWs) and the general population regarding the COVID‐19 vaccines, (2) to evaluate factors influencing the acceptance of vaccination using the health belief model (HBM), and (3) to qualitatively explore the suggested intervention strategies to promote the vaccination. METHODS: This was a cross‐sectional study based on electronic survey data that was collected in Iraq during December first‐19th, 2020. The electronic survey was designed using Qualtrics. HBM was followed to develop the survey items. A regression analysis was used to identify factors influencing people accepting vaccination. Thematic analysis for participant comments to an open‐ended question. RESULTS: A total of 1680 completed surveys were received. The mean age of 31.2 ± 9.9 years, 53.0% were female and 47.0% were male. The largest group was HCWs (45.7%), followed by general population (37.5%) and health college students (16.8%). Our findings expressed some hesitancy to receive the COVID‐19 vaccine with the acceptance rate of 61.7%. The HCWs perceived significantly higher susceptibility and severity of the COVID‐19 infection compared to the general population. The HCWs were significantly more likely than the general population to receive COVID‐19 vaccine. Concerns with proper storage was the biggest barrier to vaccine receipt. The regression analysis indicated eight factors that were significantly associated with the willingness to receive COVID‐19 vaccine: Preventive measures, perceived benefit, perceived barriers, cue to action, subjective norm, supportive of vaccination in general and having received a flu vaccine before. CONCLUSIONS: Awareness campaign can focus on enhancing the vaccine perceived benefit, debunking misconceptions, and increasing the disease perceived severity. Additionally, the public health leaders need to minimize the perceived barriers by providing the vaccines and appeasing people concerns about their storage, effectiveness, and adverse events.","Al‐Metwali, Basma Zuheir; Al‐Jumaili, Ali Azeez; Al‐Alag, Zahraa Adel; Sorofman, Bernard",J Eval Clin Pract,188,16
