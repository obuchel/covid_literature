10,10,10,Conservation of polyamine regulation by translational frameshifting from yeast to mammals,11.391011,5.3057256,2000-04-17,"Regulation of ornithine decarboxylase in vertebrates involves a negative feedback mechanism requiring the protein antizyme. Here we show that a similar mechanism exists in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe. The expression of mammalian antizyme genes requires a specific +1 translational frameshift. The efficiency of the frameshift event reflects cellular polyamine levels creating the autoregulatory feedback loop. As shown here, the yeast antizyme gene and several newly identified antizyme genes from different nematodes also require a ribosomal frameshift event for their expression. Twelve nucleotides around the frameshift site are identical between S.pombe and the mammalian counterparts. The core element for this frameshifting is likely to have been present in the last common ancestor of yeast, nematodes and mammals.","Ivanov, Ivaylo P.; Matsufuji, Senya; Murakami, Yasuko; Gesteland, Raymond F.; Atkins, John F.",EMBO J,10,1
58,58,58,"From Functional Genomics to Functional Immunomics: New Challenges, Old Problems, Big Rewards",11.641921,5.378946,2006-07-28,"The development of DNA microarray technology a decade ago led to the establishment of functional genomics as one of the most active and successful scientific disciplines today. With the ongoing development of immunomic microarray technology—a spatially addressable, large-scale technology for measurement of specific immunological response—the new challenge of functional immunomics is emerging, which bears similarities to but is also significantly different from functional genomics. Immunonic data has been successfully used to identify biological markers involved in autoimmune diseases, allergies, viral infections such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), influenza, diabetes, and responses to cancer vaccines. This review intends to provide a coherent vision of this nascent scientific field, and speculate on future research directions. We discuss at some length issues such as epitope prediction, immunomic microarray technology and its applications, and computation and statistical challenges related to functional immunomics. Based on the recent discovery of regulation mechanisms in T cell responses, we envision the use of immunomic microarrays as a tool for advances in systems biology of cellular immune responses, by means of immunomic regulatory network models.","Braga-Neto, Ulisses M; Marques, Ernesto T.

327,327,327,Definition of Mafa-A and -B haplotypes in pedigreed cynomolgus macaques (Macaca fascicularis),11.569599,5.6118317,2009-11-24,"The major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I B gene/allelic repertoire was investigated in a pedigreed population of cynomolgus macaques of mixed Indonesian/Malaysian origin. The Mafa-B alleles detected in this cohort are mostly specific for a given geographic area, and only a small number of alleles appears to be shared with other populations. This suggests the fast evolution of Mafa-B alleles due to adaptation to new environments. In contrast to humans, the B locus in Old World monkeys displays extensive copy number variation. The Mafa-B and previously defined -A gene combinations segregate in families and thus allowed the definition of extended haplotypes. In many cases it was possible to assign a particular Mafa-I allele to one of these Mafa-A/B haplotypes as well. The presence of a large number of stable haplotypes in this cohort of animals, which was pedigreed for up to eight generations, looks promising for developing discriminative MHC typing tools that are less cumbersome. Furthermore, the discovery of 53 unreported Mafa-B sequences expands the lexicon of alleles significantly, and may help in understanding the complex organisation of the macaque B region.","Otting, Nel; Doxiadis, Gaby G.

We describe a novel siRNA-based approach – synthetically linking siRNA to an oligonucleotide TLR9 agonist – that targets and silences genes in TLR9(+) myeloid cells and B cells, both of which are key components of the tumor microenvironment. Because Stat3 in tumor-associated immune cells suppresses antitumor immune responses and hinders TLR9-induced immune stimulation, we tested CpG-Stat3siRNA conjugates for anti-tumor effects. When injected locally at the tumor site or systemically through an intravenous route, the CpG-Stat3siRNA conjugates access tumor-associated dendritic cells, macrophages and B cells, inhibit Stat3 expression, leading to activation of tumor-associated immune cells, and ultimately potent anti-tumor immune responses. Our findings demonstrate the potential of TLR agonist-siRNA conjugates for targeted gene silencing coupled with TLR stimulation and immune activation in the tumor microenvironment.","Kortylewski, Marcin; Swiderski, Piotr; Herrmann, Andreas; Wang, Lin; Kowolik, Claudia; Kujawski, Maciej; Lee, Heehyoung; Scuto, Anna; Liu, Yong; Yang, Chunmei; Deng, Jiehui; Soifer, Harris S.; Raubitschek, Andrew; Forman, Stephen; Rossi, John J.; Pardoll, Drew M.; Jove, Richard; Yu, Hua",Nat Biotechnol,10,8
437,437,437,Insights into the Evolution and Emergence of a Novel Infectious Disease,11.519393,5.680409,2010-09-30,"Many zoonotic, novel infectious diseases in humans appear as sporadic infections with spatially and temporally restricted outbreaks, as seen with influenza A(H5N1). Adaptation is often a key factor for successfully establishing sustained human-to-human transmission. Here we use simple mathematical models to describe different adaptation scenarios with particular reference to spatial heterogeneity within the human population. We present analytical expressions for the probability of emergence per introduction, as well as the waiting time to a successful emergence event. Furthermore, we derive general analytical results for the statistical properties of emergence events, including the probability distribution of outbreak sizes. We compare our analytical results with a stochastic model, which has previously been studied computationally. Our results suggest that, for typical connection strengths between communities, spatial heterogeneity has only a weak effect on outbreak size distributions, and on the risk of emergence per introduction. For example, if [Image: see text] or larger, any village connected to a large city by just ten commuters a day is, effectively, just a part of the city when considering the chances of emergence and the outbreak size distribution. We present empirical data on commuting patterns and show that the vast majority of communities for which such data are available are at least this well interconnected. For plausible parameter ranges, the effects of spatial heterogeneity are likely to be dominated by the evolutionary biology of host adaptation. We conclude by discussing implications for surveillance and control of emerging infections.","Kubiak, Ruben J.; Arinaminpathy, Nimalan; McLean, Angela R.",PLoS Comput Biol,10,17

Plastid has a central role of carrying out photosynthesis in plant cells. Plastid transformation is becoming more popular and an alternative to nuclear gene transformation because of various advantages like high protein levels, the feasibility of expressing multiple proteins from polycistronic mRNAs, and gene containment through the lack of pollen transmission. Recently, much progress in plastid engineering has been made. In addition to model plant tobacco, many transplastomic crop plants have been generated which possess higher resistance to biotic and abiotic stresses and molecular pharming. In this mini review, we will discuss the features of the plastid DNA and advantages of plastid transformation. We will also present some examples of transplastomic plants developed so far through plastid engineering, and the various applications of plastid transformation.","Wani, Shabir H.; Haider, Nadia; Kumar, Hitesh; Singh, N.B.",Curr Genomics,10,1
1272,1272,1272,Ligand Clouds around Protein Clouds: A Scenario of Ligand Binding with Intrinsically Disordered Proteins,11.561861,5.6108856,2013-10-03,"Intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) were found to be widely associated with human diseases and may serve as potential drug design targets. However, drug design targeting IDPs is still in the very early stages. Progress in drug design is usually achieved using experimental screening; however, the structural disorder of IDPs makes it difficult to characterize their interaction with ligands using experiments alone. To better understand the structure of IDPs and their interactions with small molecule ligands, we performed extensive simulations on the c-Myc(370–409) peptide and its binding to a reported small molecule inhibitor, ligand 10074-A4. We found that the conformational space of the apo c-Myc(370–409) peptide was rather dispersed and that the conformations of the peptide were stabilized mainly by charge interactions and hydrogen bonds. Under the binding of the ligand, c-Myc(370–409) remained disordered. The ligand was found to bind to c-Myc(370–409) at different sites along the chain and behaved like a ‘ligand cloud’. In contrast to ligand binding to more rigid target proteins that usually results in a dominant bound structure, ligand binding to IDPs may better be described as ligand clouds around protein clouds. Nevertheless, the binding of the ligand and a non-ligand to the c-Myc(370–409) target could be clearly distinguished. The present study provides insights that will help improve rational drug design that targets IDPs.","Jin, Fan; Yu, Chen; Lai, Luhua; Liu, Zhirong",PLoS Comput Biol,10,1

1643,1643,1643,Hijacking of an autophagy-like process is critical for the life cycle of a DNA virus infecting oceanic algal blooms,11.820222,5.6230335,2014-09-07,"Marine photosynthetic microorganisms are the basis of marine food webs and are responsible for nearly 50% of the global primary production. Emiliania huxleyi forms massive oceanic blooms that are routinely terminated by large double-stranded DNA coccolithoviruses. The cellular mechanisms that govern the replication cycle of these giant viruses are largely unknown. We used diverse techniques, including fluorescence microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, cryoelectron tomography, immunolabeling and biochemical methodologies to investigate the role of autophagy in host–virus interactions. Hallmarks of autophagy are induced during the lytic phase of E. huxleyi viral infection, concomitant with up-regulation of autophagy-related genes (ATG genes). Pretreatment of the infected cells with an autophagy inhibitor causes a major reduction in the production of extracellular viral particles, without reducing viral DNA replication within the cell. The host-encoded Atg8 protein was detected within purified virions, demonstrating the pivotal role of the autophagy-like process in viral assembly and egress. We show that autophagy, which is classically considered as a defense mechanism, is essential for viral propagation and for facilitating a high burst size. This cellular mechanism may have a major impact on the fate of the viral-infected blooms, and therefore on the cycling of nutrients within the marine ecosystem.","Schatz, Daniella; Shemi, Adva; Rosenwasser, Shilo; Sabanay, Helena; Wolf, Sharon G; Ben-Dor, Shifra; Vardi, Assaf",New Phytol,10,28
1827,1827,1827,Forecasting the 2013–2014 Influenza Season Using Wikipedia,11.434505,5.215484,2015-05-14,"Infectious diseases are one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality around the world; thus, forecasting their impact is crucial for planning an effective response strategy. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), seasonal influenza affects 5% to 20% of the U.S. population and causes major economic impacts resulting from hospitalization and absenteeism. Understanding influenza dynamics and forecasting its impact is fundamental for developing prevention and mitigation strategies. We combine modern data assimilation methods with Wikipedia access logs and CDC influenza-like illness (ILI) reports to create a weekly forecast for seasonal influenza. The methods are applied to the 2013-2014 influenza season but are sufficiently general to forecast any disease outbreak, given incidence or case count data. We adjust the initialization and parametrization of a disease model and show that this allows us to determine systematic model bias. In addition, we provide a way to determine where the model diverges from observation and evaluate forecast accuracy. Wikipedia article access logs are shown to be highly correlated with historical ILI records and allow for accurate prediction of ILI data several weeks before it becomes available. The results show that prior to the peak of the flu season, our forecasting method produced 50% and 95% credible intervals for the 2013-2014 ILI observations that contained the actual observations for most weeks in the forecast. However, since our model does not account for re-infection or multiple strains of influenza, the tail of the epidemic is not predicted well after the peak of flu season has passed.","Hickmann, Kyle S.; Fairchild, Geoffrey; Priedhorsky, Reid; Generous, Nicholas; Hyman, James M.; Deshpande, Alina; Del Valle, Sara Y.",PLoS Comput Biol,10,1
2135,2135,2135,Percutaneous Vaccination as an Effective Method of Delivery of MVA and MVA-Vectored Vaccines,11.558605,5.6602855,2016-02-19,"The robustness of immune responses to an antigen could be dictated by the route of vaccine inoculation. Traditional smallpox vaccines, essentially vaccinia virus strains, that were used in the eradication of smallpox were administered by percutaneous inoculation (skin scarification). The modified vaccinia virus Ankara is licensed as a smallpox vaccine in Europe and Canada and currently undergoing clinical development in the United States. MVA is also being investigated as a vector for the delivery of heterologous genes for prophylactic or therapeutic immunization. Since MVA is replication-deficient, MVA and MVA-vectored vaccines are often inoculated through the intramuscular, intradermal or subcutaneous routes. Vaccine inoculation via the intramuscular, intradermal or subcutaneous routes requires the use of injection needles, and an estimated 10 to 20% of the population of the United States has needle phobia. Following an observation in our laboratory that a replication-deficient recombinant vaccinia virus derived from the New York City Board of Health strain elicited protective immune responses in a mouse model upon inoculation by tail scarification, we investigated whether MVA and MVA recombinants can elicit protective responses following percutaneous administration in mouse models. Our data suggest that MVA administered by percutaneous inoculation, elicited vaccinia-specific antibody responses, and protected mice from lethal vaccinia virus challenge, at levels comparable to or better than subcutaneous or intramuscular inoculation. High titers of specific neutralizing antibodies were elicited in mice inoculated with a recombinant MVA expressing the herpes simplex type 2 glycoprotein D after scarification. Similarly, a recombinant MVA expressing the hemagglutinin of attenuated influenza virus rgA/Viet Nam/1203/2004 (H5N1) elicited protective immune responses when administered at low doses by scarification. Taken together, our data suggest that MVA and MVA-vectored vaccines inoculated by scarification can elicit protective immune responses that are comparable to subcutaneous vaccination, and may allow for antigen sparing when vaccine supply is limited.","Meseda, Clement A.; Atukorale, Vajini; Kuhn, Jordan; Schmeisser, Falko; Weir, Jerry P.",PLoS One,10,1
2923,2923,2923,Multipartite viruses: adaptive trick or evolutionary treat?,11.539757,5.261518,2017-11-09,"Multipartitism counts amongst the weirdest lifestyles found in the virosphere. Multipartite viruses have genomes segmented in pieces enclosed in different capsids that are independently transmitted. Since all segments have to meet in the host for complementation and completion of the viral cycle, multipartite viruses are bound to fight the loss of genomic information. While this is an obvious disadvantage of this strategy, no consensus on its actual advantages has been reached. In this review we present an exhaustive summary of all multipartite viruses described to date. Based on evidence, we discuss possible mechanistic and evolutionary origins of different groups, as well as their mutual relationships. We argue that the ubiquitous interactions of viruses with other unrelated viruses and with subviral elements might be regarded as a plausible first step towards multipartitism. In agreement with the view of the Virosphere as a deeply entangled network of gene sharing, we contend that the power of multipartitism relies on its dynamical and opportunistic nature, because it enables immediate adaptive responses to environmental changes. As such, perhaps the reasons for its success should be shought in multipartitism itself as an adaptive mechanism, to which its evolutionarily short-lived products (that is, the extant ensemble of multipartite viral species) are subordinated. We close by discussing how our understanding of multipartitism would improve by using concepts and tools from systems biology.","Lucía-Sanz, Adriana; Manrubia, Susanna",NPJ Syst Biol Appl,10,13

Phlorotannins that are isolated from E. cava are well-known to have an antioxidant effect and strong antiviral activity against porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), which has a high mortality rate in piglets. In this study, the bioactive components were determined based on two different approaches: (i) bio-guided isolation using the antiviral activity against the H1N1 viral strain, which is a representative influenza virus that originates from swine and (ii) high-resolution mass spectrometry-based dereplication, including relative mass defects (RMDs) and HPLC-qTOFMS fragmentation analysis. The EC70 fraction showed the strongest antiviral activity and contained thirteen phlorotannins, which were predicted by dereplication. Ten compounds were directly isolated from E. cava extract and then identified. Moreover, the dereplication method allowed for the discovery of two new phlorotannins. The structures of these two isolated compounds were elucidated using NMR techniques and HPLC-qTOFMS fragmentation analysis. In addition, molecular modelling was applied to determine the absolute configurations of the two new compounds. The antiviral activities of seven major phlorotannins in active fraction were evaluated against two influenza A viral strains (H1N1 and H9N2). Six of the compounds showed moderate to strong effects on both of the viruses and phlorofucofuroeckol A (12), which showed an EC(50) value of 13.48 ± 1.93 μM, is a potential active antiviral component of E. cava.","Cho, Hyo Moon; Doan, Thi Phuong; Ha, Thi Kim Quy; Kim, Hyun Woo; Lee, Ba Wool; Pham, Ha Thanh Tung; Cho, Tae Oh; Oh, Won Keun",Mar Drugs,10,1

Due to their colonial habits which implies close contacts between individuals, bats are often parasitized by multiple species of micro- and macroparasites. The particular ecology, behavior, and environment of bat species may shape patterns of intra- and interspecific pathogen transmission, as well as the presence of specific vectorial organisms. This review synthetizes information on a multi-level parasitic system: bats, bat flies and their microparasites. Bat flies (Diptera: Nycteribiidae and Streblidae) are obligate, hematophagous ectoparasites of bats consisting of ~500 described species. Diverse parasitic organisms have been detected in bat flies including bacteria, blood parasites, fungi, and viruses, which suggest their vectorial potential. We discuss the ecological epidemiology of microparasites, their potential physiological effects on both bats and bat flies, and potential research perspectives in the domain of bat pathogens. For simplicity, we use the term microparasite throughout this review, yet it remains unclear whether some bacteria are parasites or symbionts of their bat fly hosts.","Szentiványi, Tamara; Christe, Philippe; Glaizot, Olivier",Front Vet Sci,10,1

Y2H allows identification of protein interaction partners using screening libraries, while RY2H is used to determine residues critical to a given protein–protein interaction by exploiting site-directed mutagenesis. Currently, both these techniques still rely on sequencing of positive clones using conventional Sanger sequencing. For Y2H, a screen can yield several positives; the identification of such clones is further complicated by the fact that sequencing products usually contain vector sequence. For RY2H, obtaining a complete sequence is required to identify the full range of residues involved in protein–protein interactions. However, with Sanger sequencing limited to 500–800 nucleotides, sequencing is usually carried from both ends for clones greater than this length. Analysis of such RY2H data thus requires assembly of sequencing products combined with trimming of vector sequences and of low-quality bases at the beginning and ends of sequencing products. Further, RY2H analysis requires collation of mutations that abrogate a DB/AD interaction. Here, we present 2HybridTools, a Java program with a user-friendly interface that allows addressing all these issues inherent to both Y2H and RY2H. Specifically, for Y2H, 2HybridTools enables automated identification of positive clones, while for RY2H, 2HybridTools provides detailed mutation reports as a basis for further investigation of given protein–protein interactions.","Cauchy, Pierre; Kahn-Perlès, Brigitte; Ferrier, Pierre; Imbert, Jean; Lécine, Patrick",PeerJ,10,1

Setting: Medical ICU, University Hospital. Design: Prospective, observational study. Patients: Patients without any prior history of chronic lung disease, consecutively admitted to the ICU to receive NIPSV for ARF due to severe CAP. Measurements and results (means ± SD): Twenty-four patients aged 49±17 years, admission APACHE II 13±5, were included. Admission PaO(2)/FIO(2), alveolar-arterial oxygen difference (DA-aO(2)) and PaCO(2) were 104±48, 447±120 and 40±10 mmHg, respectively. All patients were normotensive. During the initial NIPSV trial respiratory rate decreased from 34±8 to 28±10 breaths/min (p<0.001) and arterial oxygenation improved (PaO(2)/FIO(2) 104±48 vs 153±49, DA-aO(2) 447±120 vs 370±180 mmHg, p<0.001) while PaCO(2) remained unchanged. There were no hemodynamic effects. Subsequently, a total of 133 NIPSV trials were performed (median duration 55 min, range 30–540 min) over 1–7 days. No complication occurred during NIPSV. Sixteen patients were intubated (66%) 1.3±1 days after inclusion. Upon inclusion, the patients who were subsequently intubated were older (55±15 vs 37±12 years) and more severely hypoxemic (63±11 vs 80±15 mmHg, p<0.05) than those not requiring intubation. Eight patients died (33%), all in the intubated group. Median lengths of stay in the ICU and hospital were longer in intubated patients (ICU 16 days, range 3–64 vs 6 days, range 3–7, p<0.05; hospital 23 days, range 9–77 vs 9.5 days, range 4–42, p<0.05). Mean daily total PRN points were stable throughout the NIPSV period and were not different between the groups. Only 14% of PRN points resulted from respiratory therapy interventions. PRN score was higher during the first 24 h following intubation than during the first 24 h of NIPSV (278±55 vs 228±24 points, p<0.05). Conclusion: Despite initial improvement in arterial oxygenation with NIPSV in patients with ARF due to severe CAP, the intubation rate is high. However, the more favorable outcome and shorter ICU and hospital stays when intubation is avoided, as well as the short delay required to assess the success or failure of NIPSV warrants a trial of NIPSV in this setting. The nursing workload remains stable during NIPSV and does not result predominantly from respiratory therapy interventions.","Jolliet, Philippe; Abajo, Blanca; Pasquina, Patrick; Chevrolet, Jean-Claude",Intensive Care Med,10,20

METHODS: Children between the ages of 1 month to 18 years, who fulfilled the WHO clinical criteria for dengue infection and American European Consensus Criteria criteria for ARDS with Dengue IgM positivity, were evaluated. Patients were studied as group D (receiving diuretic therapy alone) and group B (both ventilation and diuretics), and compared to a historical control group V (ventilation alone). Furosemide infusion was administered at 0.05–0.1 mg/kg/hour for 48 hours, maintaining a urine output of 2–4 mL/kg/hour. RESULTS: There was a significant difference in survival in the three groups. Significant difference was noted between pre- and postintervention arterial blood gases with respect to PCO(2) (P=0.02), pO(2) (P=0.003), PaO(2)/FaO(2) ratio (P<0.001) and alveolar-arteriolar oxygen gradient (P=0.002).

Following a burst of viral transcription in TG neurons, lytic cycle viral genes are suppressed and latency is established. The latency-associated transcript (LAT) is the only viral gene abundantly expressed during latency, and LAT expression is important for the latency-reactivation cycle. Reactivation from latency is required for virus transmission and recurrent disease, including encephalitis. The Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway is differentially expressed in TG during the bovine herpesvirus 1 latency-reactivation cycle. Hence, we hypothesized HSV-1 regulates the Wnt/β-catenin pathway and promotes maintenance of latency because this pathway enhances neuronal survival and axonal repair. New studies revealed β-catenin was expressed in significantly more TG neurons during latency compared to TG from uninfected mice or mice latently infected with a LAT(-/-) mutant virus. When TG explants were incubated with media containing dexamethasone to stimulate reactivation, significantly fewer β-catenin+ TG neurons were detected. Conversely, TG explants from uninfected mice or mice latently infected with a LAT(-/-) mutant increased the number of β-catenin+ TG neurons in the presence of DEX relative to samples not treated with DEX. Impairing Wnt signaling with small molecule antagonists reduced virus shedding during explant-induced reactivation. These studies suggested β-catenin was differentially expressed during the latency-reactivation cycle, in part due to LAT expression.","Harrison, Kelly S.; Zhu, Liqian; Thunuguntla, Prasanth; Jones, Clinton",PLoS One,10,1

Virus concentration prior to detergent treatment was best accomplished by ultracentrifugation or by a simple, less expensive, and more practical method involving acid (HCl) precipitation of NDV. Virus concentrated by polyethylene glycol precipitation was found to have a low antigen titer and was not considered suitable as an AGP antigen. Antigens derived from the LaSota, Roakin, and Texas GB strains formed at least two lines of identity in the AGP test as early as 24 hr after inoculation of the agar gels. Virus used for AGP antigen production could be grown in chicken embryos from an NDV-immune as well as susceptible breeder flock. The NDV AGP antigen was found to be stable after 20 consecutive freezing and thawing cycles and storage at −20 C or 4 C for at least 6 months. Detergent-treated NDV was used as an AGP test antigen to determine serum antibody responses of chickens following infection and vaccination. Hemagglutination-inhibition, virus neutralization, and enzyme-linked immunosorbant assay antibody production was also evaluated for comparative purposes. The AGP test was found to be useful as an aid in diagnosing field infections and assessing inactivated virus vaccination responses. These purposes were achieved by demonstrating an increase in the number of AGP positive chickens between preinfection and postinfection or vaccination bleedings. The ease of performance and low cost of the AGP test favors its use for screening large numbers of serum samples, perhaps in conjunction with a quantitative serological test. Further, the AGP test may be useful in regions where limited facilities or technical capabilities preclude the use of other serological procedures.","GELB, J.; CIANCI, C.G.",Poult Sci,10,1

Slot blots or RNase protection assays were done on AP RNA from 3-, 6-, 12-, 18- and 24-mo-old male F344 rats consuming food ad libitum (AL) or food restricted (FR; to 60% of AL food intake) from 6 wk. Both AL and FR rats gained body weight during the study (P < 0.05), but FR rats weighed ∼40% less (P < 0.0001). Messenger RNA levels were expressed in two ways, i.e., per total AP and per microgram total AP RNA. Proopiomelanocortin (POMC) mRNA/μg RNA was higher (P < 0.0005) in FR than in AL rats at all ages. Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) β mRNA declined with age (P < 0.05) in AL but not FR rats and was reduced by FR up to 12 mo (P < 0.01). Growth hormone (GH) mRNA/μg RNA declined with age (P < 0.05) in AL but not FR rats, and total GH mRNA in the AP was reduced by FR at early ages (P < 0.05). FR reduced prolactin (PRL) mRNA and its age-related increase (P < 0.0005). Levels of luteinizing hormone (LH) β and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) β mRNAs did not differ between AL and FR rats until 12 mo, but thereafter rose in FR (LH β mRNA; P < 0.01, FSH β mRNA; P < 0.05). Many of these changes in gene expression corroborate previously reported hormonal changes in FR rodents and mutant mice with extended life spans, and thus provide further support for the hypothesis that an altered hormonal milieu contributes to the antiaging effects of food restriction.","Han, Eun-Soo; Evans, Ted R.; Lee, Shuko; Nelson, James F.",J Nutr,10,1

Proteases that reside in the endocytic pathway are the principal actors of terminal protein degradation. The proteases contained in the endocytic pathway are classified into four major groups based on the active-site amino acid used by the enzyme to hydrolyze amide bonds of proteins: cysteine, aspartyl, serine, and metalloproteases. The presentation of peptide antigens by major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II molecules is strictly dependent on the action of proteases. Class II molecules scour the endocytic pathway for antigenic peptides to bind and present at the cell surface for recognition by CD4(+) T cells. The specialized cell types that support antigen presentation by class II molecules are commonly referred to as professional antigen presenting cells (APCs), which include bone marrow-derived B lymphocytes, dendritic cells (DCs), and macrophages. In addition, the expression of certain endocytic proteases is regulated either at the level of gene transcription or enzyme maturation and their activity is controlled by the presence of endogenous protease inhibitors.","Bryant, Paula Wolf; Lennon-Duménil, Ana-Maria; Fiebiger, Edda; Lagaudriére-Gesbert, Cécile; Ploegh, Hidde L",Adv Immunol,10,5

A virus is a unique cellular parasite, dependent upon the host for reproduction and nourishment in a variety of different ways. Since, as with the other types of parasites, the host and the parasite have necessarily evolved together. It is a distortion to consider the resistance of the host, without considering the evolutionary steps in the development of this extreme form of parasitism; therefore, this chapter reviews some of the ideas put forward about host-agent interactions in plants as well as in animals. The importance of genes in regulating the resistance to disease, including parasites and parasitoids, is apparent if the disease is considered to be an important evolutionary force. The selective effects of viruses have not yet been adequately studied. Continued attempts to find a correlation between the different blood groups and differing severity of smallpox infection clearly searched for selective forces, but the results were inconclusive. Most of the knowledge of genetic resistance to virus disease rests on the study of resistance to selected agents in various inbred strains of mice and chickens, rather than on any knowledge of the effects of genetic resistance in a natural heterozygous population. The increasing frequency, however, with which genetic resistance is found, is in itself an evidence that these genes are important in natural outbred populations. In addition, there are increasing numbers of virus diseases, in which the viral agent seems to be inherited in a mendelian fashion.","Bang, Frederik B.",Adv Virus Res,10,1

Additionally, antiretroviral drugs have provided an effective means of protection against HIV transmission. Despite these advances, significant limitations exist; namely, the inability to eliminate HIV reservoirs, the inability to reverse lymphoid tissues damage, and the lack of an effective vaccine for preventing HIV transmission. Evaluation of the safety and efficacy of therapeutics and vaccines for eliminating HIV reservoirs and preventing HIV transmission requires robust in vivo models. Since HIV is a human-specific pathogen, that targets hematopoietic lineage cells and lymphoid tissues, in vivo animal models for HIV-host interactions require incorporation of human hematopoietic lineage cells and lymphoid tissues. In this review, we will discuss the construction of mouse models with human lymphoid tissues and/or hematopoietic lineage cells, termed, human immune system (HIS)-humanized mice. These HIS-humanized mouse models can support the development of functional human innate and adaptive immune cells, along with primary (thymus) and secondary (spleen) lymphoid tissues. We will discuss applications of HIS-humanized mouse models in evaluating the safety and efficacy of therapeutics against HIV reservoirs and associated immunopathology, and delineate the human immune response elicited by candidate HIV vaccines. In addition to focusing on how these HIS-humanized mouse models have already furthered our understanding of HIV and contributed to HIV therapeutics development, we discuss how emerging HIS-humanized rat models could address the limitations of HIS-mouse models.","Agarwal, Yash; Beatty, Cole; Biradar, Shivkumar; Castronova, Isabella; Ho, Sara; Melody, Kevin; Bility, Moses Turkle",Retrovirology,10,22

There was a marked age‐related difference in the clinical response to infection between the 3 strains although they all produced heat‐stable toxin. All 3 strains produced severe clinical signs of depression, anorexia, vomiting, diarrhoea, followed by dehydration and death in one‐day‐old piglets. In piglets infected at 3 days of age the two K88+ ETEC caused diarrhoea and death but the K99+ ETEC induced moderate diarrhoea only. In piglets infected at 7 days of age, the 064 strain produced severe diarrhoea and death, the 020 strain caused mild diarrhoea in 3 of 6 piglets with one death while the 08 strain caused no illness. Pathological changes in the intestinal tract associated with these infections were minimal, or absent. Immunofluorescent staining with homologous hyperimmune sera demonstrated adherence of the 3 ETEC strains to the brush border of small intestinal epithelial cells. Fluorescing organisms were observed in all infected piglets irrespective of the severity of clinical signs but the degree and extent of colonisation varied with the age of the piglets and the infecting strain.

In addition, there are three unclassified viruses and, at least, three alleged viruses infecting horses. Differential diagnosis is difficult. At least twenty‐eight of the fifty‐eight viruses induce clinical disease but the range of syndromes is limited; eleven provoke respiratory symptoms and eleven cause encephalitis. Thirty‐four equine viruses with a limited geographical distribution are transmitted by arthropod vectors. Twenty viruses are spread by contact and their distribution, in general, is global. The vector‐transmitted virus diseases are best controlled by prophylactic vaccination. The viral contagions are not, in general, well controlled by vaccination and it is likely that prophylactic chemotherapy will become increasingly important in the future. RÉSUMÉ: On sait que douze virus ADN et quarante trois virus ARN sont responsables d'infections chez le cheval. En outre trois virus non classés et trois autres agents de type viral au moins sont également infectants pour cette espèce. Le diagnostic différentiel est difficile.

Trente quatre virus dont la distribution géographique est limitée sont transmis par des arthropodes vecteurs. Vingt virus sont disséminés par contact et leur répartition est en général à l'échelle du globe. Les maladies provoquées par des virus à propagation vectorielle sont mieux controlées par une vaccination préventive.

Recently, published literature examining wildlife response to fire and fire management has increased rapidly. However, none of this literature has been synthesized quantitatively, precluding assessment of consistent patterns of wildlife response among treatment types. Using meta‐analysis, we examined the scientific literature on vertebrate demographic responses to burn severity (low/moderate, high), fire surrogates (forest thinning), and fire and fire surrogate combined treatments in the most extensively studied fire‐prone, forested biome (forests of the United States). Effect sizes (magnitude of response) and their 95% confidence limits (response consistency) were estimated for each species‐by‐treatment combination with two or more observations. We found 41 studies of 119 bird and 17 small‐mammal species that examined short‐term responses (≤4 years) to thinning, low/moderate‐ and high‐severity fire, and thinning plus prescribed fire; data on other taxa and at longer time scales were too sparse to permit quantitative assessment. At the stand scale (<50 ha), thinning and low/moderate‐severity fire demonstrated similar response patterns in these forests. Combined thinning plus prescribed fire produced a higher percentage of positive responses. High‐severity fire provoked stronger responses, with a majority of species possessing higher or lower effect sizes relative to fires of lower severity. In the short term and at fine spatial scales, fire surrogate forest‐thinning treatments appear to effectively mimic low/moderate‐severity fire, whereas low/moderate‐severity fire is not a substitute for high‐severity fire. The varied response of taxa to each of the four conditions considered makes it clear that the full range of fire‐based disturbances (or their surrogates) is necessary to maintain a full complement of vertebrate species, including fire‐sensitive taxa. This is especially true for high‐severity fire, where positive responses from many avian taxa suggest that this disturbance (either as wildfire or prescribed fire) should be included in management plans where it is consistent with historic fire regimes and where maintenance of regional vertebrate biodiversity is a goal.","Fontaine, Joseph B.; Kennedy, Patricia L.",Ecol Appl,10,1

This pathway may involve not only pathogens, but also self proteins, and may thus be involved in self‐tolerance. We have characterized the processing of the endoplasmic reticulum‐restricted glycoprotein (G) of vesicular stomatitis virus, termed poison tail (Gpt), biochemically and enzymatically, and by T cell recognition assays. Expressed with a vaccinia vector, Gpt remains endoglycosidase H‐sensitive and does not mature to endoglycosidase D sensitivity. The protein is degraded in the ER with a T1/2 of 4 h. Gpt peptides are not secreted since Gpt‐infected cells are unable to sensitize uninfected antigen‐presenting cells in an innocent bystander assay. Using flow cytometry, Gpt is undetectable on the plasma membrane; in contrast, wild‐type G is readily found on the surface or secreted into the milieu as soluble G following infection of A20 cells with a vaccinia recombinant expressing G. The degradation of Gpt is sensitive to the thiol reagent diamide and occurs optimally at physiological pH. A series of proteolytic inhibitors were tested: 3,4‐dichloroisocoumarin and 1‐chloro‐3‐tosylamido‐7‐amino‐2‐heptanone inhibited degradation, which suggests the involvement of a serine protease. The degradation does not require transport to the Golgi complex, and is not sensitive to a variety of lysosomotropic agents. We show that the degradation products include the immunogenic epitopes recognized by a panel of T cell clones and hybridomas.","Bartido, Shirley M.; Diment, Stephanie; Reiss, Carol S.",Eur J Immunol,10,7

The Above Local Elevated Respiratory Illness Threshold (ALERT) algorithm uses a threshold‐based approach to suggest incidence levels that historically have indicated the transition from endemic to epidemic activity. In this paper, we present the first detailed overview of the computational approach underlying the algorithm. In the motivating example section, we evaluate the performance of ALERT in determining the onset of increased respiratory virus incidence using laboratory testing data from the Children's Hospital of Colorado. At a threshold of 10 cases per week, ALERT‐selected intervention periods performed better than the observed hospital site periods (2004/2005–2012/2013) and a CUSUM method. Additional simulation studies show how data properties may effect ALERT performance on novel data. We found that the conditions under which ALERT showed ideal performance generally included high seasonality and low off‐season incidence.","Brown, Alexandria C.; Lauer, Stephen A.; Robinson, Christine C.; Nyquist, Ann‐Christine; Rao, Suchitra; Reich, Nicholas G.",Stat Med,10,1

Despitea host range restricted to primates, experimental infection of rodents with certain genetically well defined poliovirus strains produces neurological disease. The outcome of infection of mice with mouse-adapted poliovirus strains has been described previously mainly in terms of paralysis and death, and it was generally assumed that these strains produce the same disease syndromes in normal mice and in mice transgenic for the human poliovirus receptor (hPVR-tg mice). We report a comparison of the clinical course and the histopathological features of neurological disease resulting from intracerebral virus inoculation in normal micewith those of murine poliomyelitis in hPVR-tg mice. The consistent pattern of clinical deficits in poliomyelitic transgenic mice contrasted with highly variable neurologic disease that developed in mice infected with different mouse-adapted polioviruses. Histopathological analysis showed a diffuse encephalomyelitis induced by specific poliovirus serotype 2 isolates in normal mice, that affected neuronal cell populations without discrimination, whereas in hPVR-tg animals, damage was restricted to spinal motor neurons. Mouse neurovirulent strains of poliovirus type 2 differed from mouse neurovirulent poliovirus type 1 derivatives in their ability to induce CNS lesions. Our findings indicate that the characteristic clinical appearance and highly specific histopathological features of poliomyelitis are mediated by the hPVR. Our data lead us to conclude that the tissue tropism of mouse-adapted poliovirus strains in normal mice is fundamentally different from that of poliovirus in hPVR-tg mice and primates, and that this is indicative of an as yet unknown mechanism of adsorption and uptake of the virus into cells of the murine CNS.","Gromeier, Matthias; Lu, Hui-Hua; Wimmer, Eckard",Microb Pathog,10,1

Previously, we showed that ATRA in combination with Lysine-specific demethylase 1 (LSD1) inhibition by tranylcypromine (TCP) can induce myeloid differentiation in AML blasts. This phase I/II clinical trial investigated the safety and efficacy of TCP/ATRA treatment as salvage therapy for relapsed/refractory (r/r) AML. The combination was evaluated in 18 patients, ineligible for intensive treatment. The overall response rate was 20%, including two complete remissions without hematological recovery and one partial response. We also observed myeloid differentiation upon TCP/ATRA treatment in patients who did not reach clinical remission. Median overall survival (OS) was 3.3 months, and one-year OS 22%. One patient developed an ATRA-induced differentiation syndrome. The most frequently reported adverse events were vertigo and hypotension. TCP plasma levels correlated with intracellular TCP concentration. Increased H3K4me1 and H3k4me2 levels were observed in AML blasts and white blood cells from some TCP/ATRA treated patients. Combined TCP/ATRA treatment can induce differentiation of AML blasts and lead to clinical response in heavily pretreated patients with r/r AML with acceptable toxicity.

Supported by measurements of single-cell growth trajectories and cell wall elasticity, we present a single-cell growth model for yeast. The model links the thermodynamic quantities, such as turgor pressure, osmolarity, cell wall elasto-plasticity, and cell size, applying concepts from rheology and thin shell theory. It reproduces cell size dynamics during single-cell growth, budding, and hyper-osmotic or hypo-osmotic stress. We find that single-cell growth rate and final size are primarily governed by osmolyte uptake and consumption, while bud expansion requires additionally different cell wall extensibilities between mother and bud. Based on first principles the model provides a more accurate description of size dynamics than previous attempts and its analytical simplification allows for easy combination with models for other cell processes.","Altenburg, Tom; Goldenbogen, Björn; Uhlendorf, Jannis; Klipp, Edda",NPJ Syst Biol Appl,10,13

Fisetin, a dietary flavonoid extracted from berries and family Fabaceae, has displayed neuroprotective and anti-oxidant activities. In this study we investigated whether fisetin exerted a protective effect against sepsis-induced multiple organ dysfunction in mouse cecum ligation and puncture (CLP) model. The mice were injected with fisetin (10 mg/kg, ip) 0.5 h prior to CLP, and sacrificed 18 h after CLP. We found that fisetin administration significantly alleviated CLP-induced lung, liver and kidney injury, as well as the expression levels of interleukin (IL)-6, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α and IL-1β in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF). In lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-treated mouse bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs), application of fisetin (3–10 μM) dose-dependently inhibited the expression levels of IL-6, TNF-α, IL-1β, and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS). Furthermore, fisetin dose-dependently inhibited the phosphorylation of p38 MAPK, MK2, and transforming growth factor-β-activated kinase (TAK) 1 via attenuating the interaction between TAK1 and TAK-binding proteins (TAB) 1. These results demonstrate that fisetin is a promising agent for protecting against sepsis-induced inflammatory response and organ injury via inhibiting macrophage activation.","Zhang, Hai-feng; Zhang, Hai-bo; Wu, Xue-ping; Guo, Ya-ling; Cheng, Wei-dong; Qian, Feng",Acta Pharmacol Sin,10,1

We then examined which socio-demographic and clinical variables were associated with changes in these outcomes. Data came from 1479 counselees who completed questionnaires (GCOS-18, PPC and STAI) at three time points: before the start of genetic counselling, after the first consultation and after the results of genetic counselling were disclosed. Results showed that at group level empowerment, perceived personal control and anxiety improved significantly after the whole genetic counselling process. Effect-sizes were medium for empowerment and small for the other outcomes. At individual level, 48% of counselees improved in empowerment, 21% in perceived personal control and 17% in anxiety. Around 10% of counselees worsened on all outcomes. Only ‘reason for referral’ and ‘genetic test result’ were significantly associated with changes in outcomes. This study demonstrated improvements among counselees in cognitive and affective outcomes after genetic counselling at group level. However, our results also suggest that there are opportunities for improvement at individual level, as many counselees remained stable and some even worsened on all outcomes. Routine outcome monitoring could help to explore the needs of counselees and could help to identify counselees who worsen.","Voorwinden, Jan S.; Plantinga, Mirjam; Ausems, Margreet; Knoers, Nine; Velthuizen, Mary; Birnie, Erwin; Lucassen, Anneke M.; Ranchor, Adelita V.; van Langen, Irene M.",Eur J Hum Genet,10,1

The roles of STAT6 signal in allergy, immune regulation, tumorigenesis, and renal fibrosis have been documented. However, the function and mechanism of STAT6 signal in sympathetic overactivation-induced cardiac fibrosis have not been fully elucidated. This study explores the novel role of STAT6 signal in isoproterenol (ISO)–induced cardiac fibrosis through the regulation of inflammatory response and the differentiation of macrophages from immature myeloid cells. The expression levels of STAT6, β1-adrenergic receptor (β1-AR), and inflammatory factors [interleukin α (IL-1α), IL-6, IL-18, and transforming growth factor β (TGF-β)] in CD11b(+) myeloid cells were analyzed with a microarray study. The levels of IL-6 and TGF-β1 in the CD11b(+) myeloid cells–derived macrophages were detected with reverse transcriptase–polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). STAT6–knockout (KO) and WT mice were used to establish a murine cardiac fibrosis model by ISO injection. Cardiac fibroblasts were isolated from the hearts of newborn STAT6-KO and WT mice, and STAT6 expression was measured by Western blotting and RT-PCR after ISO stimulation, while α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) expression was detected by immunofluorescence and immunohistochemistry staining. Cardiac function and pathological characteristics were examined by echocardiography and immunohistochemistry staining, respectively. Immunohistochemistry staining with anti-CD11b was performed to detect the infiltration of CD11b(+) myeloid cells in heart tissue. Flow cytometry analysis was used to measure the percentages of CD11b(+) myeloid cells and CD11b(+)Ly6C(+) macrophages in the peripheral blood. The results showed that STAT6 was highly expressed in CD11b(+) myeloid cells located in injured hearts, and STAT6 expression in cardiac fibroblasts was down-regulated after ISO treatment. STAT6 deficiency further aggravated ISO-induced increased expression of α-SMA in cardiac fibroblasts, myocardial fibrosis, and cardiac dysfunction. The activation of ISO/β1-AR signal aggravated cardiac inflammatory infiltration, promoted CD11b(+) myeloid cell mobilization, and enhanced CD11b(+)Ly6C(+/low) macrophage differentiation, which was further exacerbated by STAT6 deficiency. Furthermore, β1-AR mRNA expression significantly increased in splenic CD11b(+) myeloid cells compared to their bone marrow–derived controls, and STAT6 deficiency promoted β1-AR expression in an MI-induced sensitive cardiac fibrosis mouse model. The spleen-derived CD11b(+) myeloid cells of STAT6-KO mice produced more IL-1α, IL-18, and TGF-β than their WT counterparts. Taken together, these results suggest that STAT6 signal plays a critical role in ISO-induced β1-AR overactivation and systemic inflammatory cascades, contributing to cardiac fibrogenesis. STAT6 should be a promising cardioprotective target against myocardial fibrosis and heart failure after β1-AR overactivation–induced myocardial injury.","Zhang, Weiwei; Zhu, Baoling; Ding, Suling; Wang, Xiangfei; Wu, Jian; Zhu, Xiaowei; Zou, Yunzeng; Ge, Junbo; Tong, Minghong; Yang, Xiangdong",Front Physiol,10,1

This study aims to validate this test in a Spanish sample. This study included 209 healthy normosmic volunteers (154 females and 55 males) aged between 20 to 79 years (mean age = 50.11 ± 15.18 years) as the normative sample.

Results indicate that men and women, as well as smokers and non-smokers, performed equally in every test. However, significant differences were found between age groups in every score. The general trend is that olfactory function progressively decreases as a function of age, the elderly group (+60 years) being the one with the lowest scores.

Little is known about this topic in Greece, which, although a traditionally conservative country, is changing at the legal level towards a greater recognition of transgender people’s rights. This study aimed to investigate transgender people’s attitudes towards having a child to whom they are genetically related and pursuing fertility treatments in Greece. METHODS: This is a prospective qualitative study conducted with adult individuals who identified as transgender men or transgender women between April 2019 and March 2020. Individual in-depth qualitative interviews were conducted with 12 participants. The interviews were carried out in person and were digitally recorded and transcribed verbatim. We performed a thematic analysis of the data. RESULTS: The thematic data analysis resulted in the identification of themes that represent key barriers to pursuing fertility preservation or the use of assisted reproductive technology. Six major themes were clearly present in the findings (lack of adequate information and counseling, worsening gender dysphoria, increased discrimination against transgender people due to the rise of extreme far-right populism, low parental self-efficacy, high costs, and a less-than-perfect legal framework). Moreover, diverse cases were examined, and minor themes, such as the symbolic value of the uterus and pregnancy, the relationship between the type of gender transition and willingness to pursue fertility treatments, and transgender people’s adherence to heteronormative patterns in the context of reproduction, were identified. Various reasons for transgender people’s differing degrees of desire for parenthood were identified. CONCLUSION: Our findings demonstrated contextual factors as well as factors related to transgender people themselves as barriers to pursuing transgender parenthood. Most aspects of our findings are consistent with those of previous research. However, some aspects of our findings (regarding aggressive behaviors and economic instability) are specific to the context of Greece, which is characterized by the rise of extreme far-right populism due to the decade-long Greek economic crisis and a deeply conservative traditionalist background. In that regard, the participants highlighted the (perceived as) less-than-perfect Greek legislation on transgender people’s rights as a barrier to transgender (biological) parenthood.

Increasing number of vaccine-hesitant people in recent years threatens, or even effectively disables, herd immunity levels of the population and results in outbreaks of previously already controlled diseases. We aimed to apply a framework for ethical analysis of vaccination in childhood based on the four principles of biomedical ethics (respect for autonomy, nonmaleficence, beneficence and justice) to provide a comprehensive and applicable model on how to address the ethical aspects of vaccination at both individual and societal levels. We suggest finding an “ethical equilibrium”, which means that the degree of respect for parents’ autonomy is not constant, but variable; it shall depend on the level of established herd immunity and it is specific for every society. When the moral obligation of individuals to contribute to herd immunity is not fulfilled, mandatory vaccination policies are ethically justified, because states bear responsibility to protect herd immunity as a common good.","Rus, Meta; Groselj, Urh",Vaccines (Basel),10,1

Evidence from mouse models and cancer patients reveal that various CD4+ T cell subsets play an antagonistic role in the antitumor immune response. This review summarizes current knowledge on CD4+ T cell subsets, on how they impact tumor growth in patients, and which role these cells play in newest cancer immunotherapies. ABSTRACT: Cancer immunotherapy activates the immune system to specifically target malignant cells. Research has often focused on CD8+ cytotoxic T cells, as those have the capacity to eliminate tumor cells after specific recognition upon TCR-MHC class I interaction. However, CD4+ T cells have gained attention in the field, as they are not only essential to promote help to CD8+ T cells, but are also able to kill tumor cells directly (via MHC-class II dependent recognition) or indirectly (e.g., via the activation of other immune cells like macrophages). Therefore, immunotherapy approaches have shifted from only stimulating CD8+ T cells to targeting and assessing both, CD4+ and CD8+ T cell subsets. Here, we discuss the various subsets of CD4+ T cells, their plasticity and functionality, their relevance in the antitumor immune response in patients affected by cancer, and their ever-growing role in therapeutic approaches for human cancer.","Richardson, Jennifer R.; Schöllhorn, Anna; Gouttefangeas, Cécile; Schuhmacher, Juliane",Cancers (Basel),10,1

This study investigated the in vitro metronidazole resistance patterns in T. vaginalis isolates obtained from South African pregnant women and the genotypes of these isolates. This study included 362 pregnant women recruited from a hospital in Durban, South Africa. The women provided self-collected vaginal swabs for the detection of T. vaginalis by culture in Diamonds media. Cultured isolates were then subjected to anaerobic susceptibility assays to metronidazole. For the genotyping assays, the actin gene was digested by HindII, MseI, and RsaI. The banding patterns obtained after digestion was used to determine the genotypes. A total of 21/362 (5.8%) pregnant women tested positive for T. vaginalis infection. Of the 21 T. vaginalis isolates tested for metronidazole susceptibility, 9.5% (2/21) had a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 4 μg/ml (resistant), 38.1% (8/21) had a MIC of 2 μg/ml (intermediate), and 52.4% (11/21) had a MIC ≤ 1 μg/ml (susceptible). The dominant genotype that was identified across the isolates was genotype G. There was no correlation between genotype harboured and metronidazole susceptibility patterns. In this study, resistance to metronidazole was observed in clinical isolates of T. vaginalis.

However, in DL, the extraction of features and classification are entirely automated. The advent of these techniques in many areas of medicine, such as in the diagnosis of epileptic seizures, has made significant advances. In this study, a comprehensive overview of works focused on automated epileptic seizure detection using DL techniques and neuroimaging modalities is presented. Various methods proposed to diagnose epileptic seizures automatically using EEG and MRI modalities are described. In addition, rehabilitation systems developed for epileptic seizures using DL have been analyzed, and a summary is provided. The rehabilitation tools include cloud computing techniques and hardware required for implementation of DL algorithms. The important challenges in accurate detection of automated epileptic seizures using DL with EEG and MRI modalities are discussed. The advantages and limitations in employing DL-based techniques for epileptic seizures diagnosis are presented. Finally, the most promising DL models proposed and possible future works on automated epileptic seizure detection are delineated.","Shoeibi, Afshin; Khodatars, Marjane; Ghassemi, Navid; Jafari, Mahboobeh; Moridian, Parisa; Alizadehsani, Roohallah; Panahiazar, Maryam; Khozeimeh, Fahime; Zare, Assef; Hosseini-Nejad, Hossein; Khosravi, Abbas; Atiya, Amir F.; Aminshahidi, Diba; Hussain, Sadiq; Rouhani, Modjtaba; Nahavandi, Saeid; Acharya, Udyavara Rajendra",Int J Environ Res Public Health,10,1

The education sector has high potential to improve immediate nutrition outcomes by providing food in schools and to have more long‐term impact through education. We developed a conceptual framework to show how the education sector can be leveraged for nutrition. We reviewed the literature to identify existing frameworks outlining how nutrition programs can be delivered by and through the education sector and used these to build a comprehensive framework. We first organized nutrition programs in the education sector into (1) school food, meals, and food environment; (2) nutrition and health education; (3) physical activity and education; (4) school health services; and (5) water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) sector. We then discuss how each one can be successfully implemented. We found high potential in improving nutrition standards and quality of school foods, meals and food environment, especially through collaboration with the agriculture sector. There is a need for well‐integrated, culturally appropriate nutrition and health education into the existing school curriculum. This must be supported by a skilled workforce—including nutrition and public health professionals and school staff. Parental and community engagement is cornerstone for program sustainability and success. Current monitoring and evaluation of nutrition programming in schools is weak, and effectiveness, including cost‐effectiveness, of interventions is not yet adequately quantified. Finally, we note that opportunities for leveraging the education sector in the fight against rising overweight and obesity rates are under‐researched and likely underutilized in LMICs.","Xu, Yvonne Yiru; Sawadogo‐Lewis, Talata; King, Shannon E.; Mitchell, Arlene; Roberton, Timothy",Matern Child Nutr,10,1
18429,18429,18429,Recent Advances in Hollow Gold Nanostructures for Biomedical Applications,11.58376,5.5763764,2021-06-08,"BACKGROUND: In German emergency rescue services, inhalation treatment is routinely carried out by qualified health personnel. Standard operating procedures (SOP) for nebulization are neither uniform throughout Germany nor available in all federal states. Standardized recommendations with respect to which nebulizer type should be used are missing. The aerosol output as well as the drug deposition rates of jet and mesh nebulizers, however, differ considerably. Mesh devices can achieve a threefold higher lung deposition. Their use in emergency departments has also been shown to be associated with a better patient outcome when compared to jet nebulizers. OBJECTIVE: This survey was designed to evaluate the type of nebulizer used in the south German rescue services. Special attention was paid to the influence of existing SOP on the decision to perform nebulization during emergency treatment. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A total of 4800 emergency paramedics working in Baden-Württemberg, Bavaria and Rhineland-Palatinate received a questionnaire with a total of 17 questions on the implementation of drug nebulization in the daily practice. RESULTS: Despite the existence of more efficient nebulizer types, the jet nebulizer was by far the most frequently used nebulizer in the south German rescue services. The deposition rates of both the jet and mesh nebulizers were considerably overestimated by most respondents; however, 77.5% of all respondents could not give any information about the deposition rates of the mesh nebulizer. Only two thirds of all respondents carried out nebulization treatment on the basis of SOP. The implementation of SOP, however, was pivotal to the application of nebulization during emergencies. If SOP were in place,76.9% of the responders used aerosol treatment compared to 23.1% when there were none. The perceived safety when using nebulization during emergencies was also significantly higher (p = 0.013) when SOP were implemented. CONCLUSION: The exclusive use of mesh nebulizers could standardize the treatment of emergency patients in the south German rescue services. The use of mesh devices might possibly improve patient outcomes, even if clinical studies are still lacking. Nebulizer treatment differs between the federal states. A comprehensive implementation of SOP for nebulization treatment might support this process and could increase the application frequency and the perceived safety of nebulization during emergencies. A better training of paramedic personnel could improve the knowledge of aerosols as a treatment option for emergency patients and help to classify the advantages and disadvantages of the different aerosol generators available.","Otto, M.; Kropp, Y.; Viergutz, T.; Thiel, M.; Tsagogiorgas, C.",Anaesthesist,10,1

Early identification of neonatal sepsis with meningoencephalitis is particularly important for reducing brain damage. We recruited 70 patients with neonatal sepsis, 42 of which were diagnosed as meningoencephalitis, and collected cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and serum samples. The purpose of this study was to find neonatal sepsis with meningoencephalitis-related markers using unbiased metabolomics technology and artificial intelligence analysis based on machine learning methods. RESULTS: We found that the characteristics of neonatal sepsis with meningoencephalitis were manifested mainly as significant decreases in the concentrations of homo-l-arginine, creatinine, and other arginine metabolites in serum and CSF, suggesting possible changes in nitric oxide synthesis. The antioxidants taurine and proline in the serum of the neonatal sepsis with meningoencephalitis increased significantly, suggesting abnormal oxidative stress. Potentially harmful bile salts and aromatic compounds were significantly increased in the serum of the group with meningoencephalitis. We compared different machine learning methods and found that the lasso algorithm performed best. Combining the lasso and XGBoost algorithms was successful in predicting the concentration of homo-l-arginine in CSF per the concentrations of metabolite markers in the serum. CONCLUSIONS: On the basis of machine learning combined with analysis of the serum and CSF metabolomes, we found metabolite markers related to neonatal sepsis with meningoencephalitis. The characteristics of neonatal sepsis with meningoencephalitis were manifested mainly by changes in arginine metabolism and related changes in creatinine metabolism.","Zhang, Peng; Wang, Zhangxing; Qiu, Huixian; Zhou, Wenhao; Wang, Mingbang; Cheng, Guoqiang",Comput Struct Biotechnol J,10,7

The first immune checkpoint inhibitor, ipilimumab (targeting cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 (CTLA-4)), showed a survival advantage over standard chemotherapy. Subsequently the anti-programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) antibodies, nivolumab and pembrolizumab were shown to be more effective than ipilimumab. Ipilimumab combined with nivolumab gives an incremental gain in overall survival compared with nivolumab alone but increases the risk of severe, potentially life-threatening toxicities. In contrast to ipilimumab monotherapy, anti-PD-1 antibodies are licensed to be continued until disease progression. Follow-up of patients recruited to the first trials evaluating 2 years of pembrolizumab showed that three-quarters of responding patients continue responding after stopping treatment. Suggestive of early response, we hypothesised that continuing anti-PD-1 treatment beyond 1 year in progression-free patients may be unnecessary and so designed the DANTE trial. METHODS: DANTE is a multicentre, randomised, phase III, non-inferiority trial to evaluate the duration of anti-PD-1 therapy in patients with metastatic (unresectable stage III and stage IV) melanoma. It uses a two-stage recruitment strategy, registering patients before they complete 1 year of first-line anti-PD-1 +/− CTLA-4 therapy and randomising eligible patients who have received 12 months of treatment and are progression-free at 1 year. At randomisation, 1208 patients are assigned (1:1) to either 1) continue anti-PD-1 treatment until disease progression/ unacceptable toxicity/ for at least 2 years in the absence of disease progression/ unacceptable toxicity or 2) to stop treatment. Randomisation stratifies for baseline prognostic factors. The primary outcome is progression-free survival at 3, 6, 9 and 12 months and then, 6-monthly for up to 4-years. Secondary outcomes collected at all timepoints include overall survival, response-rate and duration and safety, with quality of life and cost-effectiveness outcomes collected 3-monthly for up to 18-months. Sub-studies include a qualitative analysis of patient acceptance of randomisation and sample collection to inform future translational studies into response/ toxicity biomarkers. DISCUSSION: DANTE is a unique prospective trial investigating the optimal duration of anti-PD-1 therapy in metastatic melanoma patients. Outcomes will inform future use of these high burden drugs.

Kidney diseases are currently treated with immunosuppressive agents, antihypertensives and diuretics with partial but limited success. Most kidney disease is characterized by breakdown of the glomerular filtration barrier (GFB). Specialized podocyte cells maintain the GFB, and structure–function experiments and studies of intercellular communication between the podocytes and other GFB cells, combined with advances from genetics and genomics, have laid the groundwork for a new generation of therapies that directly intervene at the GFB. These include inhibitors of apolipoprotein L1 (APOL1), short transient receptor potential channels (TRPCs), soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase 1 (sFLT1; also known as soluble vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 1), roundabout homologue 2 (ROBO2), endothelin receptor A, soluble urokinase plasminogen activator surface receptor (suPAR) and substrate intermediates for coenzyme Q10 (CoQ(10)). These molecular targets converge on two key components of GFB biology: mitochondrial function and the actin–myosin contractile machinery.

19231,19231,19231,Geographical variation and factors associated with gastric cancer in Manitoba,11.759527,5.616202,2021-07-09,"OBJECTIVE: Cervical expansive laminoplasty is an effective surgical method to address multilevel cervical spinal stenosis. During surgery, the spinous processes of C2 and C7 are usually preserved to keep the insertion points of the cervical musculature and nuchal ligament intact. In this regard, dome-like laminectomy (undercutting of C7 lamina) instead of laminoplasty is performed on C7 in selected cases. However, resection of the lamina can weaken the C7 lamina, and stress fractures may occur, but this complication has not been characterized in the literature. The objective of the present study was to investigate the incidence and risk factors for C7 laminar fracture after C7 dome-like laminectomy and its impact on clinical and radiological outcomes. METHODS: Patients who underwent cervical open-door laminoplasty combined with C7 dome-like laminectomy (n=123) were classified according to the presence of C7 laminar fracture. Clinical parameters (neck/arm pain score and neck disability index) and radiologic parameters (C2–7 angle, C2–7 sagittal vertical axis, and C7–T1 angle) were compared between the groups preoperatively and at postoperatively at 3, 6, 12, and 24 months. Risk factors for complications were evaluated, and a formula estimating C7 fracture risk was suggested. RESULTS: C7 lamina fracture occurred in 32/123 (26%) patients and occurred at the bilateral isthmus in 29 patients and at the spinolaminar junction in three patients. All fractures appeared on X-ray within 3 months postoperatively, but patients did not present any neurological deterioration. The fracture spontaneously healed in 27/32 (84%) patients at 1 year and in 29/32 (91%) at 2 years. During follow-up, clinical outcomes were not significantly different between the groups. However, patients with C7 fractures showed a more lordotic C2–7 angle and kyphotic C7–T1 angle than patients without C7 fractures. C7 fracture was significantly associated with the extent of bone removal. By incorporating significant factors, the probability of C7 laminar fracture could be assessed with the formula 'Risk score = 1.08 × depth (%) + 1.03 × length (%, of the posterior height of C7 vertebral body)', and a cut-off value of 167.9% demonstrated a sensitivity of 90.3% and a specificity of 65.1% (area under the curve, 0.81). CONCLUSION: C7 laminar fracture can occur after C7 dome-like laminectomy when a substantial amount of lamina is resected. Although C7 fractures may not cause deleterious clinical outcomes, they can lead to an unharmonized cervical curvature. The chance of C7 fracture should be discussed in the shared decision-making process.","Yang, Seung Heon; Kim, Chi Heon; Lee, Chang Hyun; Ko, Young San; Won, Youngil; Chung, Chun Kee",J Korean Neurosurg Soc,10,1

The accumulation of UTs can damage the intestinal barrier integrity and cause vascular damage and progressive kidney damage. Together, these factors lead to metabolic imbalances, which in turn increase oxidative stress and inflammation and then produce uremia that affects many organs and causes diseases including renal fibrosis, vascular disease, and renal osteodystrophy. This article is based on the theory of the intestinal–renal axis, from bench to bedside, and it discusses nonextracorporeal therapies for UTs, which are classified into three categories: medication, diet and supplement therapy, and complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) and other therapies. The effects of medications such as AST-120 and meclofenamate are described. Diet and supplement therapies include plant-based diet, very low-protein diet, probiotics, prebiotics, synbiotics, and nutraceuticals. The research status of Chinese herbal medicine is discussed for CAM and other therapies.

Therefore, corresponding countermeasures should be implemented: generally, national authority needs to involve in coordination activities among regions; the regions with satisfactory coordinated growth performances need more creative approaches to maintain the coordinated growth interactions; the regions at the transitioning status need to prevent the grade decline and upgrade the performances; the regions with lagging performances need to stop the decline and reduce the gaps with others.

Periodontitis has been associated with benign tumors and cancers and withseveral disorders, including hyperlipidemia. Correspondingly, periodontal treatment may exert a positive effect on lipid metabolism, although opposite evidence has also been reported. As a counterpart, the therapy for hyperlipidemia, conventionally based on statins, has been proposed to positively affect periodontal conditions, mainly due to statin pleiotropic effects, reducing periodontal inflammation and promoting osseointegration. Therefore, the present systematic review aimed to evaluate, in subjects with untreated periodontitis and peri-implant disease (Population), the effect of routine systemically administered statins (Intervention), compared to non-statin use (Comparison), on periodontal parameters around natural teeth and implants (Outcome). Discordant results were found in periodontal parameters, and the current lack of such data related to peri-implant tissues and to alveolar bone loss highlights the need for further studies on the topic, potentially paving the way for a more comprehensive approach to periodontitis and peri-implantitis management. Indeed, the validation of the beneficial effect provided by systemically delivered statins on periodontal and peri-implant tissues may direct recall scheduling, predict response to therapy and, therefore, guide treatment strategies of periodontal and peri-implant treatments in statin users.","Di Spirito, Federica; Schiavo, Luigi; Pilone, Vincenzo; Lanza, Antonio; Sbordone, Ludovico; D’Ambrosio, Francesco",Dent J (Basel),10,1

This study aimed to investigate, on molecular basics for the first time, the effect of pantoprazole on renal IRI in rats. Different biochemical parameters and oxidative stress markers were assessed. ELISA was used to estimate proinflammatory cytokines. qRT-PCR and western blot were used to investigate the gene and protein expression. Renal histopathological examination was also performed. IRI resulted in tissue damage, elevation of serum levels of creatinine, urea nitrogen, malondialdehyde, TNF-α, IL-6, IL-1β, up-regulation of NF-κB, JNK1/2, ERK1/2, p38, and cleaved caspase-3 proteins. Furthermore, it up-regulated the expression of the Bax gene and down-regulated the expression of the Bcl-2 gene. Treatment of the injured rats with pantoprazole, either single dose or multiple doses, significantly alleviated IRI-induced biochemical and histopathological changes, attenuated the levels of proinflammatory cytokines, down-regulated the expression of NF-κB, JNK1/2, ERK1/2, p38, and cleaved caspase-3 proteins, and the Bax gene, and up-regulated Bcl-2 gene expression. Moreover, treatment with pantoprazole multiple doses has an ameliorative effect that is greater than pantoprazole single-dose. In conclusion, pantoprazole diminished renal IRI via suppression of apoptosis, attenuation of the pro-inflammatory cytokines’ levels, and inhibition of the intracellular signaling pathway MAPK (ERK1/2, JNK, p38)–NF-κB.","Fawzy, Michael A.; Maher, Sherif A.; Bakkar, Sally M.; El-Rehany, Mahmoud A.; Fathy, Moustafa",Int J Mol Sci,10,1

While attention in the global health community has focused on emerging diseases, there has been a concurrent, growing recognition that important chronic diseases, such as cancer, are often caused by infectious agents that are already widespread in human populations. For economically prosperous countries, the immediacy of this threat contrasts with their infrastructural protection from severe acute infectious disease. This reasoning leads to the conclusion that chronic infectious diseases pose a more significant threat to economically prosperous countries than zoonotic, acute infectious diseases. Research efforts directed at threats posed by infection may therefore be more effective overall if increased efforts are directed toward understanding and preventing infectious causes of chronic diseases across the spectrum of economic prosperity, as well as toward specific infrastructural improvements in less prosperous countries to protect against virulent, acute infectious diseases.","Ewald, Paul W.",Ecol Res,10,28

The potential of viral spreading via contaminated surfaces depends particularly on the ability of the virus to maintain infectivity whilst it is in the environment. This is affected by a combination of biological, physical and chemical factors. This review summarises current knowledge about the influence of environmental factors on the survival and spread of viruses via contaminated surfaces.","Vasickova, P.; Pavlik, I.; Verani, M.; Carducci, A.",Food Environ Virol,10,20

A previous study showed that the HPV16 HBE7 protein was primarily cytoplasmic while wild-type HPV16 E7 protein, termed HPV16 WE7, was concentrated in the nucleus. With the aim of studying the biological functions of HPV16 HBE7, the transforming potential of HPV16 HBE7 in NIH/3T3 cells was detected through observation of cell morphology, cell prolieration assay and anchorage-independent growth assay. The effect of HPV16 HBE7 on cell cycle was examined by flow cytometry. Dual-luciferase reporter assay and RT-PCR were used to investigate the influence of HPV16 HBE7 protein on the expression of regulation factors associated with G1/S checkpoint. The results showed that HPV16 HBE7 protein, as well as HPV16 WE7 protein, held transformation activity. NIH/3T3 cells expressing HPV16 HBE7 could easily transition from G1 phase into S phase and expressed high level of cyclin A and cdc25A. These results indicated HPV16 mutant E7 protein, located in the cytoplasm, induces oncogenic transformation of NIH/3T3 cells via up-regulation of cyclin A and cdc25A","Liu, Jin-hua; Zhang, Yu-liang; Zhu, Li-qin; Xu, Yin-yu; Zhao, Min; Wu, Xin-xing",Virol Sin,10,1

Classical studies of inbreeding in laboratory animals and livestock have shown that increased homozygosity can adversely affect spermatogenesis, ovulation and perinatal mortality and morbidity(1–3). For wild populations, the consequences of inbreeding depression have not been examined intensively, although our recent studies of the African cheetah revealed a striking degree of genetic uniformity(4,5) combined with an extremely high incidence of structurally abnormal spermatozoa (>70%) in captive(6) as well as free-ranging(7) males. In this study, we report definitive evidence that the reproductive function of free-ranging mammals can be impaired as a result of demographic contraction followed by inbreeding. In an examination of three distinct lion populations (two from the Serengeti ecosystem in East Africa and a third descended from lions in the Gir Forest of western India), a direct correlation was observed between genetic variability and two physiological traits, incidence of abnormal sperm and circulating testosterone, a critical hormone for spermatogenesis.","Wildt, D.

Depending on the semiology of the seizures and comorbidities of the patient, this stage may be treated with further antiseizure drugs or anesthesia. When seizures recur upon weaning the anesthetic agent, typically after 24 h of seizure suppression, or in the rare cases where seizure control cannot be achieved with anesthesia, status epilepticus is considered to be super refractory (SRSE).

However, the most consistent association is with viral infections, especially Epstein–Barr virus. The main clinical features are fever, liver dysfunction, coagulation abnormalities and pancytopenia. Early diagnosis and treatment are important to reducing mortality, but the diagnosis is difficult because of the rarity of the syndrome and the lack of specificity of the clinical findings. Treatment should be directed toward treating the underlying disease and to suppressing the exaggerated inflammatory response through the use of immunosuppressive agents.","Mostaza-Fernández, J.L.; Guerra Laso, J.; Carriedo Ule, D.; Ruiz de Morales, J.M.G.",Rev Clin Esp (Barc),10,28

Thus, research about WhatsApp’s influence in general and especially its influence in education was relevant and significant. While there was much research involving WhatsApp and learning, it was not conclusive about the effects of WhatsApp on student learning. Specifically, research focusing on collaborative learning using WhatsApp was lacking, including research instruments for measuring collaboration on WhatsApp. Consequently, the paper’s research problem was the lack of research instruments for measuring collaboration on WhatsApp in relation to academic achievement. To address the research problem, the study followed the important initial and conceptual steps of the instrument development process to develop a research instrument to measure collaboration on WhatsApp in relation to academic achievement. The result of the paper was a developed instrument that provides researchers with a basis to measure the explanatory constructs involved in mobile collaborative learning (MCL) processes on WhatsApp and potentially other social media platforms. Therefore, the paper made an appropriately theoretical contribution, which was grounded in the scientific literature. The study facilitated positivistic research and epistemology for acquiring objective and precise scientific knowledge. Such deductive research promotes theory testing and development and presents educators and students with scientific evidence about learning with MCL applications such as WhatsApp from which both curriculum and learning design can be informed and benefited.

Therefore, the aim of this study is to define an e-government implementation framework for developing countries. The 12 critical success factors identified for developing countries were mapped to the variables of Diffusion of Innovation (DOI) Theory in order to create the proposed implementation framework. The framework was then applied in a single case study at a government department in South Africa (SA) where the opinions of 110 managers were collected through an on-line questionnaire.

The procedure is described with the human RNA-dependent protein kinase (PKR). The Northwestern RNA blot assay provides an efficient approach for the identification of regions of a protein responsible for its RNA-binding activity. The strategy for the measurement of RNA-binding activity by Northwestern analysis involves the immobilization of target proteins on a filter membrane. Proteins fractionated by sodium dodecyl sulfate–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) are electroblotted onto a nitrocellulose filter membrane by standard techniques. The fiber-bound proteins are then analyzed for RNA-binding activity using a radioactive RNA probe; this RNA-protein blot analysis constitutes the Northwestern assay. Subsequently, a Western immunoblot analysis is carried out using the same filter membrane as is used for the Northwestern analysis to verify that comparable amounts of test proteins are present. The Western analysis is especially important in the cases of proteins that do not register as RNA-binding proteins in the Northwestern assay.","McCormack, Stephen J.; Samuel, Charles E.",,10,28

HeV was recognized in Australia 1994 in horses exhibiting respiratory disease along with a human case fatality, and then NiV was identified during a large outbreak of human cases of encephalitis with high mortality in Malaysia and Singapore in 1998–1999 along with respiratory disease in pigs which served as amplifying hosts. The recently identified third henipavirus isolate, Cedar virus (CedPV), is not pathogenic in animals susceptible to HeV and NiV disease. Molecular detection of additional henipavirus species has been reported but no additional isolates of virus have been reported. Central pathological features of both HeV and NiV infection in humans and several susceptible animal species is a severe systemic and often fatal neurologic and/or respiratory disease. In people, both viruses can also manifest relapsed encephalitis following recovery from an acute infection, particularly NiV. The recognized natural reservoir hosts of HeV, NiV, and CedPV are pteropid bats, which do not show clinical illness when infected. With spillovers of HeV continuing to occur in Australia and NiV in Bangladesh and India, these henipaviruses continue to be important transboundary biological threats. NiV in particular possesses several features that highlight a pandemic potential, such as its ability to infect humans directly from natural reservoirs or indirectly from other susceptible animals along with a capacity of limited human-to-human transmission. Several henipavirus animal challenge models have been developed which has aided in understanding HeV and NiV pathogenesis as well as how they invade the central nervous system, and successful active and passive immunization strategies against HeV and NiV have been reported which target the viral envelope glycoproteins.","Broder, Christopher C.; Wong, Kum Thong",Neurotropic Viral Infections,10,19

Among them, three of the five flocks had been vaccinated against infectious bronchitis. Virulence studies indicated that the five Chinese IBV isolates caused 10 to 30% mortality in 15-day-old specific pathogen free chickens and gross lesions were mainly confined to the kidneys in all of the dead chickens. Two oligonucleotide pairs, S1Uni2 and S1Oligo3′ or S1Oligo5′ and S1Oligo3′, were used after propagation of the isolates in embryonated eggs to amplify the S1 protein genes of the spike protein. The cDNA derived by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction was cloned and sequenced. The nucleotide and amino acid sequence of S1 protein gene had a similar degree of identity (≥92%) among the five Chinese IBV isolates. The nucleotide and amino acid identity of the S1 protein gene between the five Chinese IBV isolates and 16 strains of other IBVs varied from 60 to 81%. This clearly showed that the five Chinese IBV isolates comprised a separate genotype. These results demonstrated, for the first time, that there is a new genotype of nephropathogenic IBV circulating in vaccinated and non-vaccinated flocks in China.","Liu, Shengwang; Kong, Xiangang",Avian Pathol,10,1

As ‘diagnostic PCR’, a set of consensus nested primers was selected from highly conserved stretches of the nucleocapsid (N) gene. As ‘phylogeny’ PCR, a fragment of the spike protein gene (S1) was amplified and the PCR products were directly sequenced. To study the phylogenetic relationships of the viruses from various outbreaks, studies of molecular epizootiology were performed in Sweden, a Nordic region, where the occurrence of natural cases of the disease is relatively low and the occasional use of live vaccine(s) is well recorded and monitored. The disease appeared in the region in 1994, associated with production problems among layers of various ages. During outbreaks in 1995 and 1997, both layers and broilers were affected. To reduce losses, a live attenuated vaccine has been applied since 1997. By examining 12 cases between 1994 and 1998, molecular epizootiology revealed that, before 1997, the viruses had gene sequences very similar to strains of the Massachusetts serotype. However, comparative sequence analysis of the S1 gene revealed that the identity was not 100% to any of the strains of this serotype that we analysed. A virus related to the Dutch-type strain, D274, was also identified on one farm. Surprisingly, from 1997, the year that vaccination commenced with a live Massachusetts serotype vaccine, the majority of viruses detected had S1 sequences identical to the live Massachusetts vaccine strain. This genetic relation to the vaccine virus was also confirmed by N gene sequence analysis. The studies of molecular epizootiology reveal a strong probability that the vaccination had lead to the spread of the vaccine virus, causing various disease manifestations and a confusing epizootiological situation in the poultry population.","Farsang, A.; Ros, C.; Renström, Lena H.

The key instruments in managing public fear and panic were transparency and trust. The highest levels of government were mobilised and every conceivable channel and medium utilised to educate the domestic populace and reassure the international community. Maintaining transparency and nurturing trust did not come easy. There was concern over public morale and resilience, the absence of an international level playing field and the difficulty in differentiating Singapore from countries which managed SARS badly. Achieving trust of the domestic populace was the more difficult task and the government and political leaders had to be seen doing and initiating a range of tangible actions and activities to reassure the public. Singapore also came in for much criticism from other countries for its ‘draconian’ measures to contain the disease through home quarantine orders and other stern measures on social discipline. Risk communications is an established methodology and lessons can be drawn from the experience of many countries in managing outbreaks touching on public health. While Singapore may be unique for its particular circumstances, its experience highlighted the critical importance of ensuring transparency and public trust in confronting the disease. This paper is based on a presentation to the plenary session at the first World Health Organization (WHO) Expert Consultation on Outbreak Communications held in Singapore from 21–23rd September, 2004.","Menon, K.U.; Goh, K.T.",,10,1

Respiratory disease is caused primarily by infectious agents such as Mycoplasma pulmonis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Corynebacterium kutscheri, cilia associated respiratory (CAR) bacillus, Sendai virus and coronavirus. Other causes are cardiovascular diseases, neoplastic diseases and trauma of the upper and lower respiratory tract. A presumptive diagnosis can be made by good history and physical examination. However, many diagnostic tests are best performed under general anaesthesia. Medical treatment generally includes oxygen therapy, fluid therapy, analgesia and administration of antibiotics, the use of mucolytic agents and bronchodilators and supportive care.

Early signs of the crisis were recognized by organizational leaders, who then ushered liminality—a period when routines were disrupted, and new relational connections were made to allow members to adjust psychologically, emotionally, and socially, to activate resilience. Within the liminal period, leaders influenced the formation of new connections through mutual and swift trust and utilized these networks to enable collective meaning‐making and sensemaking. In addition, leaders communicated mindfully via these networks to promote positive emotional connections among members. These leadership tasks resulted in the formation of relational networks that could serve as social, emotional, and cognitive resources for organizational resilience.","Teo, Winnie L.; Lee, Mary; Lim, Wee‐Shiong",,10,1

Analyses are based on the case of South Korea's response to the 2015 outbreak of the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus. Based on a survey of governmental organizations, the study indicates that governmental agencies seek either reciprocal or redundant communication ties with other governmental agencies while they aim to secure crucial information from high‐level organizations to tackle the transboundary nature of the infectious disease during the outbreak response. Semi‐structured interviews with South Korean officials confirm that subnational governmental agencies rely on the national government and also seek information from other regional and local agencies to improve the resilience in interagency risk communication and to prevent the further transmission of the infectious disease in their local jurisdictions. This study empirically demonstrates how governmental agencies cope with the uncertainty of infectious disease transmission by expanding risk communication channels when hierarchical communication channels and information systems do not meet the needs of outbreak response. The research findings contribute to the understanding of the interactions across organizations in addressing the needs of public health crises that are transboundary in nature and provide important lessons for outbreak responses in South Korea as well as in other countries.","Kim, KyungWoo; Yoon, Ho Young; Jung, Kyujin",,10,8

TLR–ligand interactions trigger activation of inflammatory signal transduction and expression of genes involved in host defense. In this study, we have examined the requirement for different TLR adaptor molecules in virus‐induced chemokine expression and are currently trying to identify the TLR involved. We have found that both a herpesvirus [herpes simplex virus (HSV)] and a paramyxovirus (Sendai virus) require a functional genome to induce expression or proinflammatory chemokines in human and murine monocytic cell lines. For both viruses, this is independent of the TLR adaptor molecules TRIF and Mal. However, overexpression of the Vaccinia virus‐encoded inhibitor of TLR‐signalling A52R or dominant‐negative MyD88 totally inhibited HSV‐induced RANTES expression but only partially prevented Sendai virus from inducing this chemokine. This suggests that HSV‐induced RANTES expression occurs via a TLR pathways, whereas Sendai virus utilizes both TLR‐dependent and ‐independent pathways to stimulate expression of RANTES. We are currently trying to identify the TLRs involved. Data from these studies will also be presented at the meeting.","Melchjorsen, J.; Bowie, A. G.; Matikainen, S.; Paludan, S.

Numerical approaches have been applied to a large and varied vegetational data‐set with associated environmental data from stands dominated by Athyrium distentifolium, Thelypteris limbosperma, and Matteuccia struthiopteris in different parts of western Norway. The numerical procedures of two‐way indicator species analysis, simple discriminant functions, and canonical correspondence analysis have been used, and the strengths and weaknesses of these as tools in discerning vegetational‐environmental relationships are discussed. For each of the 96 quadrats investigated, 17 environmental variables were measured. The investigation shows that some of the observed differences in vegetational composition can be explained in terms of relatively simple soil and climatic variables measured for each quadrat. The ferns appear to be ecologically well separated. T. limbosperma‐dominaled stands are mainly characterised by low soil fertility, high January temperature, and high humidity. A. distentifolium‐dominated stands are associated with low winter temperatures, and M. struthiopteris‐dominated stands have high soil fertility and high summer temperatures.","Odland, A.; Birks, H.

In addition, they often learn a single vector for each user involved in two domains, which is insufficient to reveal user’s complex interests to both items and friends. To tackle the above issues, in this paper, we consider modeling the user-item interactions and social relations simultaneously and propose a novel metric learning-based model called RML-DGATs. Specifically, relations in two domains are modeled as two types of relation vectors, with which each user can be regarded as being translated to both multiple item-aware and social-aware representations. Then we model the relation vectors by neighborhood interactions with two carefully designed dual GATs to fully encode the neighborhood information. Finally, the two parts are jointly trained under a dual metric learning framework. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate that our model outperforms the best baseline by 1.91% to 4.74% on three metrics for top-N recommendation and the performance gains are more significant under the cold-start scenarios.","Wang, Xiaodong; Liu, Zhen; Wang, Nana; Fan, Wentao",Advances in Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining,10,1

We build a multi-agent system (MAS(IITIB)) in the context of social networks to model the mutual influence among agents’ intentions and the transformation from agents’ intentions to their behaviors in groups. On the micro level of individual agents, we construct the self-evolution rule of agents’ intentions and the generation, constraint and termination rule of agents’ behaviors; on the macro level of networked structure, we describe the mutual influence on intentions among agents, which can be diversified in both strength and polarity. We detail this multi-agent system and run experiments and simulations using the interaction of fertility intentions and the generation of fertility behaviors in families as example. Two experimental programs are designed: one is to adjust the initial fertility intentions of prospective parents, and the other is to adjust the range of weight of influence among family members, to investigate the effects on the childbearing behavior and the number of newborn children in the long-term. This study intends to provide modeling bases for the dynamics of preferences and behaviors due to mutual influence among agents in groups, particularly for the study of fertility intention and behavior in families, and more broadly, the forecast of population growth and effects of fertility policy.

In the National Cancer Institute of Egypt, we apply a protocol to prioritize cases where elective cancer surgeries that would not affect patient prognosis and outcome are postponed during the early phase and peak of the pandemic till reaching a plateau. However, emergency and urgent surgeries that can compromise cancer patient’s life and prognosis take place after the proper assessment of the patient’s condition. AIM: This review aims to spot the management of cancer patients undergoing surgery during the COVID-19 pandemic in the National Cancer Institute, Egypt.","Elsabeeny, Walaa Y.; Abd El Dayem, Omnia Y.; Rabea, Ahmed; Ibrahim, Rania S.

With more than 8 million diagnosed cases and close to 450.000 deaths worldwide by mid-June 2020, the need of safe and effective treatments is extremely urgent. Drug repurposing is a suitable approach to bring new treatments to the clinics in a very fast and cost-effective way. METHODS: We have applied an artificial intelligence screening technology based on molecular fields to find drugs that could inhibit the SARS-CoV-2 3-chymotrypsin-like cysteine protease (3CLpro) among a library of compounds with clinical experience, approved drugs and drugs in clinical development. The results were refined by covalent docking at the catalytic domain of the protein and thirty compounds were chosen for experimental validation on a protease assay with recombinant SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro. The compounds were also tested for their inhibition of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV 3CLpro. Positive hits were further tested in a VeroE6 cell infection assay with pathogenic SARS-CoV-2 using nucleocapsid protein staining at 24h post infection as a readout. RESULTS: Eravacycline was identified at the top positions of the screening and its potent inhibitory activity was demonstrated in vitro against recombinant SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV 3CL proteases, with IC50 of 1.65, 10.04 and 16.36 µM respectively. In addition, eravacycline inhibited infection of VeroE6 cells by pathogenic strains of SARS-CoV-2, with an IC50 of 30.61 µM in the absence of drug induced cell toxicity. CONCLUSION: Eravacycline is an FDA and EMA-approved antibiotic that was launched in the US in 2018. It is a safe drug that is known to accumulate in the lungs at concentrations that are compatible with its in vitro activity against SARS-CoV-2. This, together with its known antibacterial activity that could help prevent secondary infections in hospitalized COVID-19 patients, and the known anti-inflammatory actions of tetracyclines, warrant further research on the potential role of eravacycline for the treatment of patients with COVID-19 or infected with SARS-CoV-2 but with milder symptoms.

First, the Archimedean copula and co-copula are extended to handle linguistic intuitionistic cubic fuzzy information (LICFI) and the operational law of linguistic intuitionistic cubic fuzzy variables (LICFVs) based on extended copula (EC) and extended co-copula (ECC) are given. In addition, linguistic intuitionistic cubic fuzzy copula weighted average (LICFCWA) operator and linguistic intuitionistic cubic fuzzy copula weighted geometric (LICFCWG) operator are proposed based on EC and ECC under LICFI; meanwhile, some special forms of LICFCWA and LICFCWG have been obtained by different types generators of ECs and ECCs. Third, a novel MAGDM approach based on proposed LICFCWA (LICFCWG) is constructed to solve the selection problem of the online education live platform in the period of the COVID-19, and a detailed parameter analysis was carried out. Fourthly, LICFS will degenerate into linguistic intuitionistic fuzzy set and intuitionistic cubic fuzzy set, respectively, in different cases. Finally, some comparisons are carried out with other existing proposed MAGDM approaches. By comparing different types of experiments, the effectiveness and flexibility of the proposed approach are also showed.","Liu, Hao bin; Liu, Yi; Xu, Lei; Abdullah, Saleem",Comp,10,1

Critical illnesses such as acute respiratory distress syndrome and cardiogenic shock, which potentially require extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) support, are associated with changes in leukocyte numbers, phenotype, and functions. The changes observed in these illnesses could be compounded by exposure of blood to the non-endothelialized surfaces and non-physiological conditions of ECMO. This can result in further leukocyte activation, increased platelet-leukocyte interplay, pro-inflammatory and pro-coagulant state, alongside features of immunosuppression. However, the effects of ECMO on leukocytes, in particular their phenotypic and functional signatures, remain largely overlooked, including whether these changes have attributable mortality and morbidity. The aim of our narrative review is to highlight the importance of studying leukocyte signatures to better understand the development of complications associated with ECMO. Increased knowledge and appreciation of their probable role in ECMO-related adverse events may assist in guiding the design and establishment of targeted preventative actions.","Ki, Katrina K.; Millar, Jonathan E.; Langguth, Daman; Passmore, Margaret R.; McDonald, Charles I.; Shekar, Kiran; Shankar-Hari, Manu; Cho, Hwa Jin; Suen, Jacky Y.; Fraser, John F.",Front Immunol,10,5

Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) constitute important factors in numerous biological processes. However, their roles in PCOS pathogenesis require further clarification. Our study aims to elucidate the roles of lncRNA lnc-CCNL1-3:1 (CCNL) in PCOS. CCNL expression in human luteinized granulosa cells (hLGCs) derived from women with and without PCOS was detected. The full length of CCNL was obtained by 5′ and 3′ rapid amplification of cDNA ends. CCNL roles in granulosa cell apoptosis, mitochondrial function, and glucose uptake were evaluated. The binding relationship between CCNL and forkhead box O1 (FOXO1) was determined by RPISeq, RNA immunoprecipitation, subcellular fractionation, and immunofluorescence. In KGN cells and hLGCs, CCNL overexpression upregulated FOXO1 expression, promoted cell apoptosis, reduced glucose transport capability, and impaired mitochondrial function, and these effects were partially abolished by silencing FOXO1. The interaction of CCNL with FOXO1 might prevents FOXO1 exclusion from the nucleus and subsequent degradation in the cytosol. We determined that CCNL serve as a facilitator in the processes of PCOS. CCNL might participate in PCOS pathologies such as follicular atresia and insulin resistance.","Huang, Jiayu; Zhao, Jun; Geng, Xueying; Chu, Weiwei; Li, Shang; Chen, Zi-Jiang; Du, Yanzhi",Mol Ther Nucleic Acids,10,16

Although PRFs can be constructed from one-way functions generically, these black-box constructions are usually inefficient and require deep circuits to evaluate compared to direct PRF constructions that rely on specific algebraic assumptions. From lattices, one can directly construct PRFs from the Learning with Errors (LWE) assumption (or its ring variant) using the result of Banerjee, Peikert, and Rosen (Eurocrypt 2012) and its subsequent works. However, all existing PRFs in this line of work rely on the hardness of the LWE problem where the associated modulus is super-polynomial in the security parameter. In this work, we provide two new PRF constructions from the LWE problem. In each of these constructions, each focuses on either minimizing the depth of its evaluation circuit or providing key-homomorphism while relying on the hardness of the LWE problem with either a polynomial modulus or nearly polynomial modulus. Along the way, we introduce a new variant of the LWE problem called the Learning with Rounding and Errors (LWRE) problem. We show that for certain settings of parameters, the LWRE problem is as hard as the LWE problem. We then show that the hardness of the LWRE problem naturally induces a pseudorandom synthesizer that can be used to construct a low-depth PRF. The techniques that we introduce to study the LWRE problem can then be used to derive variants of existing key-homomorphic PRFs whose security can be reduced from the hardness of the LWE problem with a much smaller modulus.","Kim, Sam",Advances in Cryptology - EUROCRYPT 2020,10,18

METHODS: Dietary intake was assessed using 24-hour recall in a random sample of patients from CKD and Transplant clinics in 2019 (48) and in 2020 (30). Dietary assessments were conducted in person in 2019 and by phone in 2020. Diets were analyzed using ASA-24 software. Entries with less than 1,100 kcal were excluded from analysis. There was no difference in patterns between the two clinics so they were analyzed together. Statistical analysis was by t-test or Chi-square as appropriate. RESULTS: The 2019 cohort and the 2020 cohort were similar for age (55.9 ± 12.5 vs 60.0 ± 11.7, P = 0.148), gender (60.4% vs 43.3% male, P = 0.141), race (81.3% vs 69.2% Black, P = 0.241), and education (75% vs 80.8% with less than a college degree, P = 0.573). The 2020 patients consumed fewer total calories (1513.16 ± 350.82 vs 1731.02 ± 573.07 kcal, P = 0.041) compared to 2019 patients. For macronutrients, the 2020 cohort ate less protein (72.59 ± 24.40 vs 88.44 ± 37.17 g, P = 0.030), with no significant difference in total fat (62.11 ± 19.38 vs 72.59 ± 38.85 g, P = 0.118) and carbohydrate intake (163.08 ± 64.75 vs 185.02 ± 76.46 g, P = 0.179). In relation to protein intake, the 2020 cohort consumed less protein-rich foods such as meat, poultry, seafood, organ meat and cured meat compared to the 2019 cohort (6.74 ± 3.21 vs 8.83 ± 5.53 oz. eq., P = 0.038). Dark green vegetable consumption was also significantly less in the 2020 cohort (0.14 ± 0.29 vs 0.35 ± 0.60 cup eq., P = 0.031). Finally, the 2020 cohort consumed less water (1883.98 ± 1005.99 vs 2694.12 ± 1410.35 g, P = 0.004). CONCLUSIONS: In our population: 1. CKD and Transplant patients consumed less protein and water during the Covid-19 pandemic than in the previous year. 2. Consumption of dark green vegetables and protein-rich foods decreased significantly during the pandemic. 4. The cause of these findings may be secondary to food insecurity and/or unhealthy behaviors emerging during the COVID19 pandemic and should be explored further as poor nutrition could contribute to worse outcomes in these populations.

We need to understand predictors of poor mental health to identify at-risk women, and targets for support. BACKGROUND Previous research has demonstrated a relationship between low levels of perceived social support, and depression and anxiety in pregnant women. However, there is a lack of research into the factors that may mediate this relationship. AIM As social distancing measures (e.g., lockdown) are likely to negatively affect women's perceived support in the prenatal period, we investigated the relationship between perceived social support and both anxiety and depression in UK-based pregnant women during the COVID-19 pandemic. Further, we examined two potential mediators that may contribute to psychological symptoms: repetitive negative thinking and loneliness. METHODS We administered a battery of online measures to a sample of pregnant women (N=205) between May-June 2020, during the first peak of the pandemic in the UK, when perceived social support was likely to be low. RESULTS Consistent with predictions, perceived social support was significantly negatively related to depression, anxiety, loneliness and repetitive negative thinking. Furthermore, repetitive negative thinking and loneliness mediated the relationship between perceived social support and both depression and anxiety. Moreover, perceived social support and loneliness were associated with specific types of online behaviours. CONCLUSIONS Taken together, the findings shed light on the processes through which social support may exert its effects on depression and anxiety and highlight potential therapeutic targets for interventions which aim to prevent and treat mood disorders in perinatal cohorts.","Harrison, Virginia; Moulds, Michelle L; Jones, Katie",Women and birth : journal of the Australian College of Midwives,10,20

Among the first lines of defense against influenza virus infection, the type I interferon (IFN) response plays a major role. In the last 10 years, there have been major advances in understanding how cells recognize being infected by influenza viruses, leading to secretion of type I IFN, and on the effector mechanisms by how IFN exerts its antiviral activity. In addition, we also now know that influenza virus uses multiple mechanisms to attenuate the type I IFN response, allowing for successful infection of their hosts.

The indication for treatment varies depending on which manifestation is the cause of symptoms: lungs, heart, brain, skin, or other manifestations. While glucocorticoids (GC) remain the first choice for initial treatment of symptomatic disease, prolonged use is associated with significant toxicity. GC-sparing alternatives are available. The presented treatment guideline aims to provide guidance to physicians treating the very heterogenous sarcoidosis manifestations. MATERIALS AND METHODS A European Respiratory Society Task Force (TF) committee composed of clinicians, methodologists, and patients with experience in sarcoidosis developed recommendations based on the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations) methodology. The committee developed eight PICO (Patients, Intervention, Comparison, Outcomes) questions and these were used to make specific evidence-based recommendations. RESULTS The TF committee delivered twelve recommendations for seven PICOs. These included treatment of pulmonary, cutaneous, cardiac, and neurologic disease as well as fatigue. One PICO question regarding small fiber neuropathy had insufficient evidence to support a recommendation. In addition to the recommendations, the committee provided information on how they use alternative treatments, when there was insufficient evidence to support a recommendation.

In contexts of collective adversity, health care providers who are also members of these communities share and interdependently affect the range of responses their patients have. We aim to conceptualize this spectrum, termed shared trauma, shared resilience, and shared growth. Method: In this metasynthesis, we review the literature on these underacknowledged dynamics globally. We include prior conceptualizations of direct and indirect trauma, collective trauma, cultural context, and the COVID-19 pandemic toward clearer conceptualization of shared mental health in global collective stressor contexts. Results: Most trauma and resilience research focuses on prevailing concepts and measures with questionable cross-cultural applicability. These works usually center on acute, highly distressing threats to physical safety at the individual level. The scarce literature on shared trauma describes it as a rare phenomenon, entailing conflicting messages of narrative accounts within contexts of few cultures with medium to high degrees of individualism. There has been little consideration of other non-Western and indigenous communities with more collectivist values and collective trauma histories. There is limited understanding of these concepts as they pertain to the vast majority of cultures. As a result, shared trauma, resilience, and growth have been poorly conceptualized, differentiated, or empirically researched. Conclusions: We propose uniquely inclusive models of shared trauma, resilience, and growth. These models reflect the cumulative effects and interplay of direct to indirect, acute to chronic, individual to collective, and historic to transgenerational factors influenced by cultural context.

Here, we report the first crystal structure of full-length nsp10 from the arterivirus PRRSV, which has multiple domains: an N-terminal zinc-binding domain (ZBD), a 1B domain and helicase core domains (1A and 2A). Importantly, our structural analyses indicate that the conformation of the 1B domain from arterivirus nsp10 undergoes a dynamic transition. The polynucleotide substrate channel formed by domains 1A and 1B adopts an open state, which may create enough space to accommodate and bind dsRNA during unwinding. Moreover, we report a unique C-terminal domain structure that participates in stabilizing overall helicase structure. Our biochemical experiments also showed that deletion of the 1B domain and C-terminal domain significantly reduced the helicase activity of nsp10, indicating that the four domains must cooperate to contribute to helicase function. Besides, our results indicate that nidoviruses contain a conserved helicase core domain and key amino acid sites affecting helicase function, which share common mechanism of helicase translocation and unwinding activity. These findings will help to further our understanding of the mechanism of helicase function and provide new targets for the development of antiviral drugs.IMPORTANCE Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) is a major respiratory disease agent in pigs that causes enormous economic losses to the global swine industry. PRRSV helicase nsp10 is a multifunctional protein with translocation and unwinding activities and plays a vital role in viral RNA synthesis. Here, we report the first structure of full-length nsp10 from the arterivirus PRRSV at 3.0 Å resolution. Our results show that the 1B domain of PRRSV nsp10 adopts a novel open state and has a unique C-terminal domain structure, which plays a crucial role in nsp10 helicase activity. Furthermore, mutagenesis and structural analysis revealed conservation of the helicase catalytic domain across the order Nidovirales (families Arteriviridae and Coronaviridae). Importantly, our results will provide a structural basis for further understanding the function of helicases in the order Nidovirales.","Shi, Yuejun; Tong, Xiaohan; Ye, Gang; Xiu, Ruixue; Li, Lisha; Sun, Limeng; Shi, Jiale; Li, Mengxia; Song, Yunfeng; Fan, Chengpeng; Shi, Ke; Fu, Zhen F; Xiao, Shaobo; Peng, Guiqing",Journal of virology,10,22

Given the importance of accurate clinical patient handoffs, we adapted simulation-based medical student training in clinical patient handoffs. We scored the accuracy of the information students presented. We also elicited student feedback to determine their perceptions of the event and their evaluations of the effectiveness of the training. Methods Twenty-six third-year medical students participated online via Zoom. Students participated in groups of three or four students. They sequentially encountered a standardized patient. Clinical information and physical exam findings were handed off from student to student until the encounter was complete. The student group then debriefed with faculty. Students were evaluated based on the proportion of clinical information handed off to the following student. Students also evaluated the training session. Results The first student handoff included 73.4% of the available information. In subsequent handoffs, the percentage fell to 43%. All students said they felt the training was helpful in practicing patient handoffs and interactions with colleagues. Negative student comments focused on perceived deficiencies in session planning and standardized patient training. Conclusions This rapidly developed simulation session demonstrated that clinical training in patient handoffs can be adapted to an online environment. In order to ensure success, faculty should carefully consider logistical adjustments required to transition from a patient contact setting to an online environment. Meticulous preparation and attention to detail will ensure that training is successful.","Wells, Jack; Higbee, Dena; Doty, Jen; Louder, Elaine",PRiMER,10,29

We aimed to evaluate lipid profile, neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and cardiovascular admissions to the coronary care unit (CCU) of a tertiary center in Turkey during the COVID-19 era and to compare these results with admissions in the same time interval of the previous year. MATERIALS AND METHODS We retrospectively analyzed CCU admissions due to new-onset atrial fibrillation, ST-elevation myocardial infarction, non-ST elevation acute coronary syndrome (NSTEACS) and acute heart failure during the COVID-19 outbreak and the same time interval of the past year. Laboratory measurements including lipid profile and NLR values were retrieved from the institutional digital database. RESULTS Compared to the same time interval of 2019 (March-April, 2019), the number of patients admitted to the CCU with acute cardiovascular disorders (atrial fibrillation, STEMI, NSTEACS and acute heart failure) were lower in the COVID-19 period. The levels of NLR, total cholesterol, and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol were significantly higher and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol was significantly lower in subjects admitted to the CCU during March-April 2020 compared to subjects admitted in March-April 2019. CONCLUSIONS Our findings show that subjects admitted to the CCU in the COVID-19 era have an unfavorable lipid profile and elevated NLR compared to those admitted in 2019. These patients appear to be at high risk for future cardiovascular events.","Aladağ, N; Şipal, A; Atabey, R D; Akbulut, T; Asoğlu, R; Özdemir, M",European review for medical and pharmacological sciences,10,31

METHODS The semester-long pipeline program, Saturday Academy at New York University College of Dentistry, was conducted remotely through Zoom, and materials for hands-on, pre-clinical activities, were mailed to participants. Saturday Academy aims to educate underrepresented minority and low-income high school students about the college application process and the dental profession. After the program's completion, program applications and engagement data were analyzed. An anonymous online survey was administered to the high school student participants. The survey questions included topics about their interest in the profession of dentistry, satisfaction with the Saturday Academy programming, and program engagement. RESULTS In its remote format, Saturday Academy had an average attendance of 87.8% at each session. All (60/60, 100%) of the high school student participants responded to the anonymous program satisfaction survey. Sixty-seven percent reported an interest in the profession of dentistry before participating in the program and 82% after participating in the program. Ninety-eight percent agreed with the statement ""I enjoyed my experience participating in Saturday Academy."" Additionally, 97% agreed with the statement ""Saturday Academy's virtual programming was effective."" There were no statistically significant differences in program satisfaction when data from the virtual program were compared to 2 years of in-person program satisfaction data. CONCLUSION Challenges to fulfilling the missions of dental institutions in response to the coronavirus pandemic impact service and recruitment efforts, in addition to formal dental education.

OBJECTIVE To investigate lung deposition and distribution of nebulized porcine surfactant using an investigational eFlow neonatal nebulizer. METHODS While lying on one side, 1-day-old piglets inhaled 200 mg·kg(-1) of nebulized surfactant via mask, nasal prongs, or tracheal tube. The surfactant was diluted with normal saline to 40 mg·ml(-1) and labeled with (99m)technetium-labelled nanocolloid. Undiluted surfactant (80 mg·ml(-1)) was instilled tracheally in a fourth group. Each group had 8 animals. Lung deposition was measured by gamma scintigraphy, and deposition values were presented as a percentage of the nebulized or instilled dose. RESULTS The median lung deposition of inhaled surfactant was 5% (range 3-16) via mask, 14% (2-40) via prongs, and 45% (25-56) via tracheal tube (p < 0.05). It was 88% (71-96) with instillation. In all groups, the surfactant preferentially went to the dependent lung. Deposition ratios (upper lung/both lungs) were 0.32 (0.13-0.58), 0.15 (0.05-0.58), 0.16 (0.11-0.23), and 0.08 (0.03-0.46). CONCLUSIONS Using this nebulizer, the lung depositions of porcine surfactant were 45% via endotracheal tube and 14% via nasal-continuous positive airway pressure (prongs). These figures might be physiologically relevant, but still have to be confirmed in efficacy studies.","Linner, Rikard; Perez-de-Sa, Valeria; Cunha-Goncalves, Doris",Neonatology,10,27

RECENT FINDINGS Recent studies confirm the previously described link between increased adiposity and earlier onset of puberty in girls, and more recent studies shed light onto the previously unclear situation in boys as a preponderance of recent longitudinal studies suggests that increased adiposity is linked with earlier pubertal timing also in boys. Discoveries of novel pathways highlights the complexity of pubertal development and suggest mechanistic links between nutrition, obesity, leptin, insulin resistance, and puberty. Furthermore, genetic and epigenetic variants can be linked to early puberty. Other factors, such as prenatal and postnatal environment, gut microbiota, and endocrine-disrupting chemicals have also been linked to both obesity and earlier puberty. SUMMARY Understanding how the interactions of these factors contribute the relationship between obesity and early pubertal onset is crucial as early puberty has been linked with long-term consequences, such as short stature, earlier type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and poor psychological and behavioral outcomes.","Huang, Alyssa; Roth, Christian L",Current opinion in pediatrics,10,6

The goal of weight reduction surgery is not only to decrease excess weight, but also to improve obesity related comorbidities and quality of life (QoL). AIM To evaluate the impact of LSG on patient quality of life, weight loss, and comorbidities associated with morbid obesity according to the updated BAROS criteria. METHODS Eleven hundred thirty-eight adult patients were undergone to LSG by our bariatric surgery team between January 2013 and January 2016. A questionnaire (The Bariatric Analysis and Reporting Outcome System - BAROS) was published on social media. The data on postoperative complications were collected from hospital database. RESULTS Number of respondants was 562 (49.4%). Six of 1138 patients(0.5%) had leakage. All patients who had leakage were respondants. The overall complication rate was 7.7%. After a mean period of 7.4±5.3 months(1-30), mean excess weight loss was 71.3±27.1% (10.2-155.4). The respondants reported 772 comorbidities. Of these, 162 (30%) were improved, and 420 (54.4%) were resolved. The mean scores for QoL were significantly increased after LSG (range, p<0.05 to <0.001). Of the 562 patients, 26 (4.6%) were classified as failures; 86 (15.3%) fair; 196 (34.9%) good; 144 (25.6%) very good, and 110 (19.6%) excellent results according to the updated BAROS scoring system. CONCLUSION LSG is a highly effective bariatric procedure in the manner of weight control, improvement in comorbidities and increasing of QoL in short- and mid-term.","Wada, André M; Hashiba, Kiyoshi; Otoch, Jose P; Brasil, Horus; Marson, Fernando P; Cassab, Jorge; Abdalla, Ricardo; Artifon, Everson L A",Arquivos brasileiros de cirurgia digestiva : ABCD = Brazilian archives of digestive surgery,10,1

No study based standard treatment is established. Usually therapy protocols for bronchopulmonary carcinoids are used. So far no data exist on the effect of mTOR-inhibitors. We describe our long term experience with everolimus and give a thorough review of the therapeutic strategies used so far. PATIENTS AND METHODS 4 patients (mean age 46 years, range 37-55) with progressing thymic NEN (two well differentiated atypical carcinoids and two atypical carcinoids with large cell characteristics) were treated with everolimus 10 mg/d after failure of at least one previous medical therapy. Everolimus was applied after a mean interval of 32.4 months (range 5 - 56) after first diagnosis. The follow up included clinical examination, imaging, and chromogranin A testing in 3 or 6 monthly intervals. RESULTS We observed stable disease for a mean of 20.8 months. Both patients with large cell characteristics thymic NEN (Ki-67 of 20 %) had rapid progress after 7 and 10 months and had more previous therapies (3 and 6) than the patients with well differentiated thymic NEN (Ki-67 5 % and 10 %, progress after 24 and 42 months, 1 and 2 previous therapies). No severe side effects occurred. In 3 out of 4 patients everolimus led to stable disease for the longest, compared to the other non surgical therapies used. CONCLUSION Comparing the sparse data available everolimus is a promising treatment for thymic NEN at least in second line therapy. A low Ki-67 index was associated with a better outcome.

We aimed to construct a model integrating information from radiomics and deep learning (DL) features to discriminate critical cases from severe cases of COVID-19 using computed tomography (CT) images. METHODS We retrospectively enrolled 217 patients from three centers in China, including 82 patients with severe disease and 135 with critical disease. Patients were randomly divided into a training cohort (n=174) and a test cohort (n=43). We extracted 102 3-dimensional radiomic features from automatically segmented lung volume and selected the significant features. We also developed a 3-dimensional DL network based on center-cropped slices. Using multivariable logistic regression, we then created a merged model based on significant radiomic features and DL scores. We employed the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) to evaluate the model's performance. We then conducted cross validation, stratified analysis, survival analysis, and decision curve analysis to evaluate the robustness of our method. RESULTS The merged model could distinguish critical patients with AUCs of 0.909 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.8590.952) and 0.861 (95% CI: 0.7530.968) in the training and test cohorts, respectively. Stratified analysis indicated that our model was not affected by sex, age, or chronic disease. Moreover, the results of the merged model showed a strong correlation with patient outcomes. SIGNIFICANCE A model combining radiomic and DL features of the lung could help distinguish critical cases from severe cases of COVID-19.","Li, Cong; Dong, Di; Li, Liang; Gong, Wei; Li, Xiaohu; Bai, Yan; Wang, Meiyun; Hu, Zhenhua; Zha, Yunfei; Tian, Jie",IEEE journal of biomedical and health informatics,10,25

Stationary EEG is required to reliably apply the index algorithms. Because of rapid physiological changes, artefacts, etc., the EEG may not always fulfil this requirement. EEG analysis using permutation entropy (PeEn) may overcome this issue, since PeEn can also be applied to practically nonstationary EEG. One objective was to determine the duration of EEG sequences that can be considered stationary at different anaesthetic levels. The second, more important objective was to test the reliability of PeEn to reflect the anaesthetic levels for short EEG segments. EEG was recorded from 15 volunteers undergoing sevoflurane and propofol anaesthesia at different anaesthetic levels and for each group 10 data sets were included. EEG stationarity was evaluated for EEG sample lengths from 4 to 116 s for each level. PeEn was calculated for these sequences using different parameter settings and analysis windows from 2 to 60 s. During wakefulness EEG can only be considered stationary for sequences up to 12 s. With increasing anaesthetic level the probability and duration of stationary EEG increases. PeEn is able to reliably separate consciousness from unconsciousness for EEG segments as short as 2 s. Especially during wakefulness a conflict between stationary EEG sequence durations and methods used for monitoring may exist. PeEn does not require stationarity and functions for EEG sequences as short as 2 s. These promising results seem to support the application of non-linear parameters, such as PeEn, to depth of anaesthesia monitoring.","Kreuzer, Matthias; Kochs, Eberhard F; Schneider, Gerhard; Jordan, Denis",Journal of clinical monitoring and computing,10,26

Infected patients develop a wide range of clinical manifestations - typically presenting with fever, cough, myalgia, and fatigue. Severely-ill patients may fall victim to acute respiratory distress syndrome, acute heart injuries, neurological manifestations, or complications due to secondary infections. These critically-ill patients are also found to have disrupted coagulation function, predisposing them to consumptive coagulopathies, and both venous and thromboembolic complications. Common laboratory findings include thrombocytopenia, elevated D-dimer, fibrin degradation products, and fibrinogen, all of which have been associated with greater disease severity. Many cases of pulmonary embolism have been noted, along with deep vein thrombosis, ischemic stroke, myocardial infarction and systemic arterial embolism. The pathogenesis of COVID-19 has not been completely elucidated, but the virus is known to cause excessive inflammation, endothelial injury, hypoxia, and disseminated intravascular coagulation, all of which contribute to thrombosis formation. These patients are also faced with prolonged immobilization while staying in the hospital or intensive care unit. It is important to have a high degree of suspicion for thrombotic complications as patients may rapidly deteriorate in severe cases. Evidence suggests that prophylaxis with anticoagulation may lead to a lower risk of mortality, although it does not eliminate the possibility. The risks and benefits of anticoagulation treatment should be considered in each case. Patients should be regularly evaluated for bleeding risks and thrombotic complications.","Castro, Rebecca; Frishman, William H",Cardiology in review,10,28

Use of gloves, gown, surgical mask, N95 respirator, face protection, and infection training were each strongly protective against infection. Meta-regression showed reduced infection risk in frontline HCWs working in facilities with infection designated wards (OR -1.04, 95%CI -1.53 to -0.33, p=0.004) and performing aerosol-generating medical procedures in designated centres (OR -1.30 95%CI -2.52 to -0.08; p=0.037). CONCLUSIONS During highly infectious respiratory pandemics, widely available protective measures such as use of gloves, gowns, and face masks are strongly protective against infection and should be instituted, preferably in dedicated settings, to protect frontline HCW during waves of respiratory virus pandemics.","Tian, Chenchen; Lovrics, Olivia; Vaisman, Alon; Chin, Ki Jinn; Tomlinson, George; Lee, Yung; Englesakis, Marina; Parotto, Matteo; Singh, Mandeep",Infection control and hospital epidemiology,10,1

Low-income countries are especially at-risk, with the price of the vaccines and supply shortages limiting their ability to procure and distribute the vaccines. While the COVAX initiative is one of the solutions to these challenges, vaccine nationalism has resulted in the hoarding of vaccines and the signing of parallel bilateral deals, undermining this formerly promising initiative. Moreover, inequity in local distribution also remains a problem, with clear discrimination of minorities and lack of logistical preparation in some countries. As we continue to distribute the COVID-19 vaccines, pharmaceutical companies should share their technology to increase supply and reduce prices, governments should prioritize equitable distribution to the most at-risk in all nations and low-income countries should bolster their logistical capacity in preparation for mass vaccination campaigns.","Binagwaho, Agnes; Mathewos, Kedest; Davis, Sheila",International journal of health policy and management,10,24

METHODS We enrolled 174 patients with DKD from three centres from January 2010 to July 2017. The severity and extent of arteriosclerosis were analysed on sections based on dual immunohistochemical staining of CD31 and α-smooth muscle actin. An X-tile plot was used to determine the optimal cut-off value. The primary endpoint was renal survival (RS), defined as the duration from renal biopsy to end-stage renal disease or death. RESULTS The baseline estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of 135 qualified patients was 45 (29 ~ 70) ml/min per 1.73 m2, and the average 24-h urine protein was 4.52 (2.45 ~ 7.66) g/24 h. The number of glomeruli in the biopsy specimens was 21.07 ± 9.7. The proportion of severe arteriosclerosis in the kidney positively correlated with the Renal Pathology Society glomerular classification (r = 0.28, P < 0.012), interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy (IFTA) (r = 0.39, P < 0.001), urine protein (r = 0.213, P = 0.013), systolic BP (r = 0.305, P = 0.000), and age (r = 0.220, P = 0.010) and significantly negatively correlated with baseline eGFR (r = - 0.285, P = 0.001). In the multivariable model, the primary outcomes were significantly correlated with glomerular class (HR: 1.72, CI: 1.15 ~ 2.57), IFTA (HR: 1.96, CI: 1.26 ~ 3.06) and the modified arteriosclerosis score (HR: 2.21, CI: 1.18 ~ 4.13). After risk adjustment, RS was independently associated with the baseline eGFR (HR: 0.97, CI: 0.96 ~ 0.98), urine proteinuria (HR: 1.10, CI: 1.04 ~ 1.17) and the modified arteriosclerosis score (HR: 2.01, CI: 1.10 ~ 3.67), and the nomogram exhibited good calibration and acceptable discrimination (C-index = 0.82, CI: 0.75 ~ 0.87).

Venous thromboembolism is a common manifestation in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 with a reported incidence that is significantly higher compared to other acute viral infections. The pathophysiology mechanisms have not been fully explored and autopsy studies might enhance our understanding on this topic. Microthrombi formation occurs mainly in the pulmonary vasculature but can also occur in other organs. The high inflammatory burden related to COVID-19 seems to be associated with the coexisting coagulopathy. Concomitant manifestations of COVID-19, such as severe pneumonia, which has similar clinical presentation with pulmonary embolism (PE), and barriers related to strict isolation protocols are the two main reasons why PE diagnosis might be more challenging in patients with COVID-19.

We look at a 7- week lockdown activity for all scheduled outpatient clinics and urgent procedures. METHODS AND RESULTS A total of 2361 outpatient clinic slots (52.6% oncology slots and 47.4% benign urology slots) were scheduled during this period. The oncology slots included 330 (26.5%) flexible cystoscopy, 555 (44.7%) prostate cancer and 357(28.8%) non-prostate cancer slots. The benign urology slots included 323 (28.8%) andrology, 193 (17.2%) stones and 603 (54%) lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) slots. Of the total oncology outpatient slots (n = 1242), 66.3% were virtual consultations, 20% were face-to-face and 13.6% were cancelled. Of the total benign outpatient slots (n = 1119), 81% were virtual consultations, 9.7% were face-to-face and 9.3% were cancelled. A total of 116 anaesthetic surgical procedures were carried out, of which 54 (46.5%) were oncological procedures, 18 (15.5%) were benign urological procedures, and 44 (38%) were diagnostic procedures. CONCLUSIONS Hospitals and urologists can benefit from the model used by our hospital to mitigate the impact and prioritise patients most in need of urgent care. Reorganisation and flexibility of healthcare delivery is paramount in these troubled times and will allow clinical activity without compromising patient safety.","Somani, Bhaskar K; Pietropaolo, Amelia; Coulter, Primrose; Smith, Julian",Scottish medical journal,10,1

With polypharmacy, there is an associated risk of potentially inappropriate prescribing (PIP). The aims of this scoping review were to (1) identify the intervention elements that have been adopted to reduce PIP in the outpatient setting and (2) determine the behaviour change wheel (BCW) intervention functions performed by each of the identified intervention elements. DESIGN Scoping review DATA SOURCES: PubMed, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, EMBASE, Web of Science and Cochrane Library databases, grey literature sources, six key geriatrics journals and the reference lists of review papers. STUDY SELECTION All studies reporting an intervention or strategy that addressed PIP in the older adult population (age ≥65) with multimorbidity in the outpatient setting and in which the primary prescriber is the physician. DATA EXTRACTION Data extracted from the included studies can be broadly categorised into (1) publication details, (2) intervention details and (3) results. This was followed by data synthesis and analysis based on the BCW framework. RESULTS Of 8195 studies yielded, 80 studies were included in the final analysis and 14 intervention elements were identified. An average of two to three elements were adopted in each intervention. The three most frequently adopted intervention elements were medication review (70%), training (26.3%) and tool/instrument(s) (22.5%). Among medication reviews, 70% involved pharmacists. The 14 intervention elements were mapped onto five intervention functions: 'education', 'persuasion', 'training', 'environmental restructuring' and 'enablement'. CONCLUSION PIP is a multifaceted problem that involves multiple stakeholders. As such, interventions that address PIP require multiple elements to target the behaviour of the various stakeholders. The intervention elements and their corresponding functions identified in this scoping review will serve to inform the design of complex interventions that aim to reduce PIP.","Lee, Jia Qi; Ying, Kate; Lun, Penny; Tan, Keng Teng; Ang, Wendy; Munro, Yasmin; Ding, Yew Yoong",BMJ open,10,12
68141,68141,68141,Lobectomy for lung cancer by video-assisted thoracic surgery in situs inversus.,11.438442,5.5799317,2017,"Background: There is a trend towards decentralisation of laboratory tests by means of Point-of-Care testing (POCT). Within hospitals, Belgian law requires a POCT policy, coordinated by the clinical laboratory. There is however no legal framework for POCT performed outside the hospital: no reimbursement, no compulsory quality monitoring and no limits nor control on the prices charged to the patient. Uncontrolled use of POCT can have negative consequences for individual and public health. Proposal: We propose that POCT outside hospitals would only be reimbursed for tests carried out within a legal framework, requiring evidence-based testing and collaboration with a clinical laboratory, because clinical laboratories have procedures for test validation and quality monitoring, are equipped for electronic data transfer, are familiar with logistical processes, can provide support when technical issues arise and can organise and certify training. Under these conditions the government investment will be offset by health benefits, e.g. fall in antibiotic consumption with POCT for CRP in primary care, quick response to SARS-CoV2-positive cases in COVID-19 triage centres. Priorities:1° extension of the Belgian decree on certification of clinical laboratories to decentralised tests in primary care; 2° introduction of a separate reimbursement category for POCT; 3° introduction of reimbursement for a limited number of specified POCT; 4° setup of a Multidisciplinary POCT Advisory Council, the purpose of which is to draw up a model for reimbursement of POCT, to select tests eligible for reimbursement and to make proposals to the National Institute for Health and Disability Insurance (RIZIV/INAMI).","Van Hoof, Viviane; Barglazan, Dragos; Blairon, Laurent; Braekevelt, Bob; Debois, Regis; De Vos, Nathalie Véronique J; Gruson, Damien; Jonckheere, Jef; Lanckmans, Katrien; Moens, Marc; Peeters, Bart; Penders, Joris; Roman, Alain; Van Hoovels, Lieve; Vanstapel, Florent; Verbakel, Jan Y; Verdonck, Ann; Verstraete, Alain G",Acta clinica Belgica,10,16

In order to facilitate a full range of services for patients, some states permit advanced practice nurses to practice with full independence. However, many states limit their scopes of practice, resulting in the potential for limited healthcare access in underserved areas. The COVID-19 pandemic temporarily upended these arrangements for several states, as 17 governors quickly passed waivers and suspensions of physician oversight restrictions. ISSUES Physician resistance is a primary hurdle for states that limit advanced practice nurse scopes of practice. Longstanding restrictions were removed, however, in a short period of time. The pandemic demonstrated that even governors with strong political disagreements agreed on one way that healthcare access could potentially be improved. LESSONS LEARNED Despite longstanding concerns over patient safety when advanced practice nurses practice with full autonomy, governors quickly removed practice restrictions when faced with a crisis situation. Implied in such behavior are that policymakers were aware of advanced practice nurses' capabilities prior to the pandemic, but chose not to implement full practice authority, and that governors appeared to disagree as to whether to temporarily waive specific restrictions or suspend restrictions entirely, consistent with their political affiliation. We propose more research into understanding whether or not such changes should become permanent.","Feyereisen, Scott; Puro, Neeraj",Rural and remote health,10,19

We aimed to review morbidity and mortality data on four overlapping populations who experience considerable social exclusion: homeless populations, individuals with substance use disorders, sex workers, and imprisoned individuals. METHODS For this systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched MEDLINE, Embase, and the Cochrane Library for studies published between Jan 1, 2005, and Oct 1, 2015. We included only systematic reviews, meta-analyses, interventional studies, and observational studies that had morbidity and mortality outcomes, were published in English, from high-income countries, and were done in populations with a history of homelessness, imprisonment, sex work, or substance use disorder (excluding cannabis and alcohol use). Studies with only perinatal outcomes and studies of individuals with a specific health condition or those recruited from intensive care or high dependency hospital units were excluded. We screened studies using systematic review software and extracted data from published reports. Primary outcomes were measures of morbidity (prevalence or incidence) and mortality (standardised mortality ratios [SMRs] and mortality rates). Summary estimates were calculated using a random effects model. FINDINGS Our search identified 7946 articles, of which 337 studies were included for analysis. All-cause standardised mortality ratios were significantly increased in 91 (99%) of 92 extracted datapoints and were 11·86 (95% CI 10·42-13·30; I2=94·1%) in female individuals and 7·88 (7·03-8·74; I2=99·1%) in men. Summary SMR estimates for the International Classification of Diseases disease categories with two or more included datapoints were highest for deaths due to injury, poisoning, and other external causes, in both men (7·89; 95% CI 6·40-9·37; I2=98·1%) and women (18·72; 13·73-23·71; I2=91·5%). Disease prevalence was consistently raised across the following categories: infections (eg, highest reported was 90% for hepatitis C, 67 [65%] of 103 individuals for hepatitis B, and 133 [51%] of 263 individuals for latent tuberculosis infection), mental health (eg, highest reported was 9 [4%] of 227 individuals for schizophrenia), cardiovascular conditions (eg, highest reported was 32 [13%] of 247 individuals for coronary heart disease), and respiratory conditions (eg, highest reported was 9 [26%] of 35 individuals for asthma). INTERPRETATION Our study shows that homeless populations, individuals with substance use disorders, sex workers, and imprisoned individuals experience extreme health inequities across a wide range of health conditions, with the relative effect of exclusion being greater in female individuals than male individuals. The high heterogeneity between studies should be explored further using improved data collection in population subgroups. The extreme health inequity identified demands intensive cross-sectoral policy and service action to prevent exclusion and improve health outcomes in individuals who are already marginalised.

Moreover, pitfalls of NPPV reduce its rate of success; consistently, a clear plan of what to do in case of NPPV failure should be considered, especially for patients managed in unprotected setting. NPPV failure is likely to be reduced by the application of integrated therapeutic tools in selected patients handled by expert teams.In conclusion, NPPV has to be considered as a rational art and not just as an application of science, which requires the ability of clinicians to both choose case-by-case the best ""ingredients"" for a ""successful recipe"" (i.e. patient selection, interface, ventilator, interface, etc) and to avoid a delayed intubation if the ventilation attempt fails.","Scala, Raffaele; Pisani, Lara",European respiratory review : an official journal of the European Respiratory Society,10,20

Changes in DMEs could result in serious drug interactions. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the effects of exposure to chitosan or gold nanoparticles on hepatic Phase I and II DMEs, liver function and integrity, oxidative damage and liver architecture in male rats. Methods Animals were divided into three equal groups: a control group, a group treated with chitosan nanoparticles (200 mg/kg, 50±5 nm) and a group treated with gold nanoparticles (4 mg/kg, 15±5 nm). Rats were orally administered their respective doses daily for 10 days. Results Both chitosan and gold nanoparticles decreased the body weights by more than 10%. Gold nanoparticles reduced the activities of antioxidants (superoxide dismutase and catalase), and reduced glutathione level and elevated the malondialdehyde level in the liver. Gold nanoparticles caused significant reductions in CYP1A1, CYP2E1, quinone oxidoreductase1, and glutathione S-transferase and elevated CYP2D6 and N-acetyl transferase2. Chitosan elevated CYP2E1 and CYP2D6 and reduced UDP-glucuronosyltransferase 1A1. Both nanoparticles disturbed the architecture of the liver, but the deleterious effects after gold nanoparticles treatment were more prominent. Conclusion Taken together, gold nanoparticles severely perturbed the DMEs and would result in serious interactions with many drugs, herbs, and foods.","Al-Hamadani, Mohammed Y I; Alzahrani, Abdullah M; Yousef, Mokhtar I; Kamel, Maher A; El-Sayed, Wael M",International journal of nanomedicine,10,1

Behaviour change theories and techniques are recommended as part of complex health interventions; their integration into interventions aimed at PA behaviour in people with fibromyalgia is not known. This review explored behaviour change interventions targeting PA in adults with fibromyalgia. A systematic review was conducted; randomized and quasi-randomized controlled trials with at least one behaviour change intervention targeting PA were included. MEDLINE/OVID, EMBASE, PEDro, PsychINFO, CINAHL, Scopus, Web of Science, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and relevant conference abstracts were searched. Two authors independently screened studies for inclusion and performed risk of bias assessments. Articles were reviewed for their use of behaviour change theory and behaviour change techniques (BCTs). The search identified 2491 records, from which eight studies (1416 participants) were included. PA and exercise behaviours were the primary focus of four interventions and were components of broader interventions in four studies. Behaviour change theories informed four interventions. Thirty-two different BCTs were used across studies. Five studies reported improvements in PA either post-intervention or at follow-up. Two studies used objective PA measures and seven studies used self-report measures. Short-term benefits in pain, quality of life, and physical fitness were also observed. Behaviour change interventions targeting PA in people with fibromyalgia have had limited success to date. With significant variations in intervention designs, the optimal intervention remains unknown.","O'Dwyer, Tom; Maguire, Sinead; Mockler, David; Durcan, Laura; Wilson, Fiona",Rheumatology international,10,10

Outpatient care and dental care were limited to telephone advice and emergency services. Dental staff is particularly vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2 contraction, because of the inevitable contact with patients' body fluids during aerosol-generating procedures. The implementation of diagnostic tests among ambulatory patients could improve the occupational safety among outpatient care personnel. The aim of this review was to introduce information regarding COVID-19 diagnostics with a particular focus on the methods which can be utilized in an outpatient and dental care setting. An online PubMed database review of articles on COVID-19 diagnostics, published on February 12-May 15, 2020, was conducted. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction is the gold standard in COVID-19 diagnostics, which determines if a person has an active infection. Unfortunately, its utilization in outpatient care is limited. Serological enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays identify people who were infected, including those who have had an asymptomatic infection, but they do not give sufficient information about the acute infection. Rapid serological assays developed to facilitate testing outside of laboratories, especially in dental offices, are not recommended by the World Health Organization to be used outside research settings, and they should not constitute the basis for clinical decision-making because of frequent false-negative results which may consequently contribute to personnel infections. Out of all available COVID-19 diagnostic methods, rapid serological assays seemed to be a method of choice in outpatient medical care. Unfortunately, their results turned out to be unreliable. The best methods to ensure the occupational safety of medical staff and to avoid cross-infections in outpatient care facilities include a thorough epidemiological interview, temperature measurement to rule out patients with an active infection, and the implementation of strict infection control procedures.

Travel-related cases have been confirmed in multiple countries and regions outside mainland China including Germany, France, Thailand, Japan, South Korea, Vietnam, Canada, and the United States, as well as Hong Kong and Taiwan. Domestically in China, the virus has also been noted in several cities and provinces with cases in all but one provinence. While zoonotic transmission appears to be the original source of infections, the most alarming development is that human-to-human transmission is now prevelant. Of particular concern is that many healthcare workers have been infected in the current epidemic. There are several critical clinical questions that need to be resolved, including how efficient is human-to-human transmission? What is the animal reservoir? Is there an intermediate animal reservoir? Do the vaccines generated to the SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV or their proteins offer protection against 2019-nCoV? We offer a research perspective on the next steps for the generation of vaccines. We also present data on the use of in silico docking in gaining insight into 2019-nCoV Spike-receptor binding to aid in therapeutic development.

METHODS Data from Japanese patients enrolled in the multicenter, randomized, open-label, phase 3 ATTRACTION-3 trial were analyzed. The primary endpoint was overall survival (OS). Secondary endpoints included duration of response (DOR), objective response rate (ORR), disease control rate (DCR), and safety. Exploratory subgroup analyses evaluated the association between OS and stratification factors/baseline variables. RESULTS Overall, 274 (nivolumab, 136; chemotherapy, 138) of the 419 patients in ATTRACTION-3 were enrolled from Japan: response-evaluable population (107; 108) and safety population (135; 138). OS tended to be longer in the nivolumab group versus the chemotherapy group (median: 13.4 months vs. 9.4 months; HR, 0.77; 95% CI 0.59-1.01). Median DOR was longer in the nivolumab group (7.6 months) versus the chemotherapy group (3.6 months). ORRs were similar between the nivolumab [22.4% of patients (24/107)] and chemotherapy groups [22.2% (24/108); odds ratio, 0.98; 95% CI 0.52-1.87]. DCR was lower in the nivolumab group [41.1% (44/107)] versus the chemotherapy group [66.7% (72/108)]. OS in the exploratory analysis consistently favored the nivolumab group versus the chemotherapy group. Overall, nivolumab demonstrated favorable efficacy and safety versus chemotherapy in the Japanese subpopulation, and the trend was similar to that observed in the overall ATTRACTION-3 ITT population. CONCLUSION Nivolumab represents a new standard second-line treatment option for Japanese patients with advanced ESCC.","Takahashi, Masanobu; Kato, Ken; Okada, Morihito; Chin, Keisho; Kadowaki, Shigenori; Hamamoto, Yasuo; Doki, Yuichiro; Kubota, Yutaro; Kawakami, Hisato; Ogata, Takashi; Hara, Hiroki; Muto, Manabu; Nakashima, Yuichiro; Ishihara, Ryu; Tsuda, Masahiro; Motoyama, Satoru; Kodani, Mamoru; Kitagawa, Yuko",Esophagus : official journal of the Japan Esophageal Society,10,12

To answer this question, we use national municipal-level crime data from Mexico's National Public Security System. The NPSS reports sexual crimes, lapses in alimony, domestic violence, and femicides. Using the NPSS, we track monthly changes in crimes targeting women using an event-study design. Our results show that lapses in alimony, sexual crimes, and domestic violence follow a U-shaped trend. Each crime declined during the stay-at-home order, and then rose back to pre-COVID levels by October. Then, we analyze potential mechanisms for the reduction in crimes against women. We find that infection risk, victim-criminal match, and banning the sale of alcohol are related to higher declines in crime.","Hoehn-Velasco, Lauren; Silverio-Murillo, Adan; de la Miyar, Jose Roberto Balmori",Economics and human biology,10,27

While the burden of all Hib disease has significantly decreased in the post vaccination era, Hib still accounted for >29,000 deaths worldwide in children aged <5 years in 2015. AREAS COVERED We reviewed literature data on the most widely used Hib vaccines and vaccination strategies which led to the global prevention and control of Hib disease and aim to highlight important factors for continued disease control and elimination in the future. EXPERT COMMENTARY More than 90% of countries worldwide have implemented Hib-conjugate vaccination in their national immunization programs. Vaccines containing Hib polyribosylribitol phosphate (PRP) conjugated with tetanus toxoid (Hib-TT) are the most commonly used. Neisseria meningitidis outer membrane protein complex of PRP (Hib-OMP) is also used. Although the kinetics of the immune response varies with Hib vaccine and schedule used, high control of Hib disease was observed in all settings/scenarios. Further improving global Hib vaccination coverage may result in disease elimination.","Slack, Mary; Esposito, Susanna; Haas, Hervé; Mihalyi, Attila; Nissen, Michael; Mukherjee, Piyali; Harrington, Lauriane",Expert review of vaccines,10,24

In this study, a codon-optimized Mpro gene was cloned into pET-21a and pET-28a expression vectors. The recombinant plasmids were transformed into E. coli Rosetta(DE3) competent cells and the expression conditions were optimized. The highly expressed recombinant proteins, Mpro and Mpro-28, were purified by HisTrapTM chelating column and its proteolytic activity was determined by a fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) assay. The FRET assay showed that Mpro exhibits a desirable proteolytic activity (25 000 U/mg), with Km and kcat values of 11.68 μmol/L and 0.037/s, respectively. The specific activity of Mpro is 25 times that of Mpro-28, a fusion protein carrying a polyhistidine tag at the N and C termini, indicating additional residues at the N terminus of Mpro, but not at the C terminus, are detrimental to its proteolytic activity. The preparation of active SARS-CoV-2 Mpro through codon-optimization strategy might facilitate the development of the rapid screening assays for the discovery of broad-spectrum anti-coronaviral drugs targeting Mpro.","Chen, Yunyu; Fu, Zhenghao; Yan, Gangan; Lin, Yuan; Liu, Xiaoping",Sheng wu gong cheng xue bao = Chinese journal of biotechnology,10,30

Apart from abdominal distension, the patient denied any symptom of obvious incentives, abdominal pain, abnormal vaginal bleeding, or drainage. Biochemical analysis showed a high carbohydrate antigen-125 level and low total protein and albumin levels. Abdominal ultrasound and computed tomography showed a large amount of ascites and cystic uneven masses with an irregular shape in the area of the ovaries and fallopian tubes. Post-surgical histopathology indicated the diagnosis of sOHSS. Wedge resection of both ovaries was performed. Symptomatic treatment was further performed and the patient recovered well.

MATERIALS AND METHODS A total of 107 HCCs in 75 patients (65 men) with a mean age of 61 years (range, 44-82 y) were treated via percutaneous approach. Combination microwave ablation and transarterial chemoembolization was performed for 22 tumors in 19 patients with tumors larger than 4 cm (n = 10), tumors larger than 3 cm with ill-defined margins (n = 7), or lesions not identified with ultrasonography (n = 5). Mean tumor size was 2.1 cm (range, 0.5-4.2 cm), with median follow-up of 14 months, for ablation alone; compared with 3.7 cm (range, 1.0-7.0 cm) and 12 months, respectively, for combination therapy. All procedures were performed with a single microwave system (Certus 140) with one to three 17-gauge antennas. RESULTS Mean ablation time was 5.3 minutes (range, 1-11.5 min). All treatments were considered technically successful in a single session. Primary technique effectiveness rates were 91.6% (98 of 107) overall, 93.7% (89 of 95) for tumors 4 cm or smaller, and 75.0% (nine of 12) for tumors larger than 4 cm; and 91.8% (78 of 85) for ablation alone and 90.9% (20 of 22) for combination therapy. There was no major complication or procedure-related mortality. The overall survival rate was 76.0% at a median 14-month clinical follow-up, with most deaths related to end-stage liver disease (n = 11) or multifocal HCC (n = 5). CONCLUSIONS Treating HCC with a gas-cooled, multiantenna-capable microwave ablation device is safe, with promising treatment effectiveness.","Ziemlewicz, Timothy J; Hinshaw, J Louis; Lubner, Meghan G; Brace, Christopher L; Alexander, Marci L; Agarwal, Parul; Lee, Fred T",Journal of vascular and interventional radiology : JVIR,10,1

For hospital environments, the products recommended and authorized by regulatory institutions for environmental cleaning and disinfection need to be highly effective. OBJECTIVE To identify, systematically evaluate and summarize the best available scientific evidence on environmental cleaning to prevent COVID-19 infection. DESIGN AND SETTING A systematic review of studies analyzing cleaning products that inactivate coronavirus, conducted within the evidence-based health program of a federal university in São Paulo (SP), Brazil. METHODS A systematic search of the relevant literature was conducted in the PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, CINAHL and LILACS databases, for articles published up to May 27, 2020, relating to studies evaluating cleaning products that inactivate coronavirus in the environment. RESULTS Seven studies were selected. These analyzed use of 70% alcohol, detergent, detergent containing iodine, household bleach, sodium hypochlorite, hydrogen peroxide, chlorine dioxide, glutaraldehyde, ultraviolet irradiation and plasma air purifier. The effectiveness of treating sewage with sodium hypochlorite and chlorine dioxide was also evaluated. CONCLUSION Disinfection of environments, especially those in ordinary use, such as bathrooms, needs to be done constantly. Viral inactivation was achieved using chlorine-based disinfectants, alcohol, detergents, glutaraldehyde, iodine-containing detergents, hydrogen peroxide compounds and household bleaches. Alcohol showed efficient immediate activity. In sewage, sodium hypochlorite had better action than chlorine dioxide.

Emergency liver resection during active bleeding in a patient who takes anticoagulant therapy is a complicated and high-risk surgery. Aim. We described a technique that is combination of staplers, total hepatic vascular occlusion, and hemostatic agent (TachoSil) application for safe and quick hepatectomy. Patient and Method. A 72-year-old woman who uses warfarin regularly due to valvuloplasty admitted emergency unit with abdominal pain and shock. At admission, her hemoglobin, hematocrit, and INR values were 5.2 g/dL, 14.9%, and 6.7, respectively. Radiologic evaluation revealed abdominal free fluid and a liver lesion on segments V, VI, and VII. Emergency laparotomy was required. There was an active bleeding from a liver hematoma that could not be controlled by packing, and an urgent hepatic resection was required. Under total hepatic vascular occlusion, segments V, VI, and VII were resected with endoscopic nonvascular staplers. Cut surface of the liver was coagulated with bipolar cautery and covered with a hemostatic material. Results. Hepatectomy took six minutes, and the duration of surgery was 80 minutes. There was no complication and no transfusion required after surgery, and the patient was discharged on 8th day, uneventfully. Conclusion. Emergency hepatectomy with staplers, under vascular control with hemostatic agents, provided a rapid and safe surgery.","Kutlutürk, Koray; Soyer, Vural; Dirican, Abuzer; Unal, Bulent; Aydin, Cemalettin; Kayaalp, Cuneyt; Yilmaz, Sezai",Case reports in medicine,10,1

Aggressive endovascular management has led to survival rates of 35-50%. We report the largest series of endovascular reconstruction of occluded dominant vertebral arteries prior to basilar thrombectomy. MATERIALS AND METHODS A prospective database since August 2010 of all neuroendovascular interventions was mined for patients undergoing basilar artery thrombolysis from which a group with vertebral artery reconstruction was selected. Patient charts were retrospectively reviewed for relevant clinical, technical, and outcome data. RESULTS From August 2010 to September 2012, six patients were identified who underwent vertebral reconstruction prior to basilar thrombectomy. Patients ranged in age from 42 to 57 years (mean 51 years). Mean time from symptoms until recanalization was approximately 6 h. Angiographic Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction IIB reconstitution of the basilar trunk was achieved in all cases. There were no technical complications. Two patients had care withdrawn secondary to massive completed brainstem infarction and poor neurological status post intervention. Three patients are now independent at 12, 14, and 31 months, respectively. One patient, after a follow-up of only 8 months, has achieved a modified Rankin Scale score of 3. CONCLUSIONS Complete vertebral occlusion below a basilar thrombus can be recanalized prior to thrombectomy. In this case series, 100% of the acutely occluded vertebral arteries could be opened using either anterograde or retrograde access. However, basilar thrombosis continues to be a devastating illness, with one-third of the patients in this series dying of progressive infarction despite angiographic patency of the large conduit vessels with technical complications.","Ecker, Robert D; Tsujiura, Crystiana A; Baker, Christopher B; Cushing, Deborah",Journal of neurointerventional surgery,10,30

This increased focus and the lessons learned from this period could enhance the implementation of telerehabilitation and increase the participation in CR in Belgium.Methods: We conducted a survey between April and May 2020 about the implementation of telerehabilitation services during the COVID-19 pandemic. The electronic questionnaire was sent via email to the heads of 42 Belgian CR centres. Three reminders via email were sent during the study period.Results: 27 CR centres (64%) returned completed questionnaires after three mailings. 52% of the CR centres provided remote CR services during the lockdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic. All CR centres that provided remote CR services delivered exercise training. The most used medium to deliver the CR components were online videos (71%) followed by online information on the website (64%) and emails (64%).Conclusion: It is interesting that the COVID-19 pandemic has encouraged many CR centres to implement remote delivery of CR components.

75690,75690,75690,Taiwan's SARS hero poised to be vice-president.,11.793437,5.192144,2016,"AIMS The aims of this study were to increase the diagnostic accuracy of the analysis of synovial fluid in the differentiation of prosthetic joint infection (PJI) by the addition of inexpensive biomarkers such as the levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), adenosine deaminase (ADA), alpha-2-macrogloblulin (α2M) and procalcitonin. PATIENTS AND METHODS Between January 2013 and December 2015, synovial fluid and removed implants were requested from 143 revision total joint arthroplasties. A total of 55 patients met inclusion criteria of the receipt of sufficient synovial fluid, tissue samples and removed implants for analysis. The diagnosis of PJI followed the definition from a recent International Consensus Meeting to create two groups of patients; septic and aseptic. Using receiver operating characteristic curves we determined the cutoff values and diagnostic accuracy for each marker. RESULTS There were 23 PJIs and 32 patients with aseptic loosening. The levels of total leucocyte count, proportion of polymorphonuclear leucocytes (PMNs), CRP, ADA and α2M in the synovial fluid were all significantly higher in those with a PJI than in those with aseptic loosening. The levels of procalcitonin were comparable in the two groups. Cutoff values for the optimal performance in the diagnosis of infection were: total leucocyte count > 1463 cells/μL (sensitivity (Sens) 100%, specificity (Spec) 71.9%, positive predictive value (PPV) 71.9%, negative predictive value (NPV) 100%); proportion of PMNs > 81% (Sens 78.3%, Spec 75.0%, PPV 69.2%, NPV 82.8%); CRP > 6.7mg/L (Sens 78.3%, Spec 93.8%, PPV 90.0%, NPV 85.7%); ADA > 61U/L (Sens 78.3%, Spec 96.9%, PPV 94.7%, NPV 86.1%) and α2M > 958 mg/L (Sens 47.8%, Spec 96.9%, PPV 91.7%, NPV 72.1%). The addition of a raised level of CRP or ADA to the total leukocyte count increased the specificity: total leukocyte count > 1463 cells/μL and CRP > 6.7mg/L (Sens 78.3%, Spec 100%, PPV 100%, NPV 86.5%) or with ADA > 61U/L (Sens 78.3%, Spec 96.9%, PPV 94.7%, NPV 86.1%). CONCLUSION The total leucocyte count in the synovial fluid offers great negative predictive value in the diagnosis of PJI and the addition of more specific markers such as CRP and ADA improves the positive predictive value. Thus the addition of simple and inexpensive markers to the measurement of the leucocyte count in the synovial fluid may reduce the number of equivocal results which demand more expensive investigation.

Thus, this study aimed to critically review non-pharmacological respiratory strategies for this population. Original studies were searched in six databases considering predefined inclusion criteria. Other studies and recommendations were also included after a manual search. Oxygen therapy, invasive (IMV) and non-invasive (NIV) ventilation were the most frequent addressed interventions. In general, the original studies cited these strategies, but detailed information on parameters used was not provided. The recommendations provided more detailed data, mainly based on experiences with other acute respiratory syndromes in childhood. In the context of oxygen therapy, the nasal catheter was the most recommended strategy for hypoxemia, followed by the high-flow nasal cannula (HFNC). However, the risks of contamination due to the dispersion of aerosols in the case of the HFNC were pointed out. Lung protective IMV with the use of bacteriological or viral filters was recommended in most documents, and there was great variation about PEEP titration. Alveolar recruitment maneuvers were mentioned in a few recommendations. NIV was not consensual between studies, and when selected, several precautions must be taken to avoid contamination. Airway suctioning with closed-circuit was recommended to reduce aerosol spread. Information on prone positioning and physiotherapy was even more scarce. In conclusion, oxygen therapy seems to be essential in the treatment of hypoxemia. If necessary, IMV should not be delayed, and protective strategies are encouraged for adequate pulmonary ventilation. Information about techniques that are adjuvant to ventilatory support is superficial and require further investigation.","Rodovanski, Giovana Pascoali; Aguiar, Susana da Costa; Marchi, Bruna Samantha; Oliveira, Patricia do Nascimento; Arcêncio, Livia; Vieira, Danielle Soares Rocha; Moran, Cristiane Aparecida",Current pediatric reviews,10,31

Introduction: With support from emergency department (ED) leadership, our institution rapidly deployed telemedicine in a novel approach to large-scale ED infectious disease management at NewYork-Presbyterian/Weill Cornell Medical Center (NYP/WCMC) and NewYork-Presbyterian/Lower Manhattan Hospital (NYP/LMH). Materials and Methods: Nineteen telemedicine carts were placed in COVID-19 isolation rooms to conserve personal protective equipment (PPE) and mitigate infectious risk for patients and providers by decreasing in-person exposures. Results: The teleisolation carts were used for 261 COVID-19 patient interactions from March to May 2020, with 79% of overall use in March. Our urban academic site (NYP/WCMC) had 173 of these cases, and the urban community hospital (NYP/LMH) had 88. This initiative increased provider/patient communication and attention to staff safety, improved palliative care and patient support services, lowered PPE consumption, and streamlined clinical workflows. The carts also increased patient comfort and reduced the psychological toll of isolation. Discussion: Deploying customized placement strategies in these two EDs maximized cart availability for isolation patients and demonstrates the utility of telemedicine in various ED settings. Conclusions: The successful introduction of this program in both academic and urban community hospitals suggests that widespread adoption of similar initiatives could improve safe ED evaluation of potentially infectious patients. In the longer term, our experience underscores the critical role of telemedicine in disaster preparedness planning, as building these capabilities in advance allows for the agile scaling needed to manage unforeseen catastrophic scenarios.","Bains, Jaskaran; Greenwald, Peter W; Mulcare, Mary R; Leyden, David; Kim, Joshua; Shemesh, Amos J; Bodnar, David; Farmer, Brenna; Steel, Peter; Tanouye, Robert; Kim, Ji Won; Lame, Maria; Sharma, Rahul",Telemedicine journal and e-health : the official journal of the American Telemedicine Association,10,1

This study aimed to analyze the clinical and epidemiologic characteristics of patients with COVID-19 to better differentiate the suspected patients in Beijing, China. METHODOLOGY This was a retrospective, single-center study. Clinical and epidemiologic data were collected from suspected patients with COVID-19 admitted to Beijing Ditan Hospital from January 29 to February 21, 2020. RESULTS One hundred and six patients (60 males and 46 females, median age 36 years) were enrolled. Thirty-six patients were ultimately laboratory confirmed. Fifty-three were excluded from the diagnosis of COVID-19. The remaining 17 patients were highly suspected, although their nucleic acid tests were repeatedly negative. The confirmed patients and highly suspected patients had a significantly higher proportion of epidemiologic history than the excluded patients (P < 0.001). There was no significant difference in clinical symptoms or the underlying diseases among the three groups. The confirmed patients had a higher frequency of lymphopenia and eosinopenia than the highly suspected and excluded patients. Chest computed tomography scans showed bilateral lung involvement, and ground-glass opacity was more likely observed in the confirmed patients. CONCLUSION The clinical features of the confirmed patients with COVID-19 were insufficient for early diagnosis of COVID-19. The epidemiologic history was of great significance in the early diagnosis of COVID-19. More sensitive diagnostic methods are needed to aid the differential diagnosis of suspected patients with COVID-19.","Gao, Xuesong; Yang, Di; Yuan, Zheng; Zhang, Yijin; Li, Hongjie; Gao, Ping; Liu, Xiaomin; Zhao, Wenshan; Xiao, Te; Guan, Yanlin; Gao, Guiju; Duan, Xuefei",Journal of infection in developing countries,10,24

STUDY DESIGN Prospective experimental trial. ANIMALS Six adult ring-tailed lemurs, aged 1.3-11.2 years (median age: 8.26) and weighing a mean ± standard deviation (SD) of 2283 ± 254 g. Five adult aye-ayes, aged 4.4-19.3 years (median age: 8.0) and weighing 2712 ± 191 g. METHODS Minimum alveolar concentration of sevoflurane was determined using a tail-clamp stimulus. The end-tidal sevoflurane (Fe'Sevo) concentration was increased or decreased by approximately 10% after a positive or negative response to tail clamping, respectively. This procedure was repeated until a positive and negative result were seen on two consecutive trials (i.e. a negative result was achieved and a single 10% decrease in Fe'Sevo concentration resulted in a positive test). The MAC for that animal was determined to be the mean of the concentrations at the two consecutive trials. RESULTS The mean ± SD MAC of sevoflurane for ring-tailed lemurs was 3.48 ± 0.55% and 1.84 ± 0.17 for aye-ayes. This represents a 47.1% higher MAC in ring-tailed lemurs compared to aye-ayes. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE The sevoflurane MAC was significantly higher in ring-tailed lemurs, compared to aye-ayes. The MAC of sevoflurane in aye-ayes is consistent with reported MAC values in other species. Extrapolation of sevoflurane anesthetic dose between different species of lemurs could lead to significant errors in anesthetic dosing.","Chinnadurai, Sathya K; Williams, Cathy",Veterinary anaesthesia and analgesia,10,19

We experimentally tested this prediction by studying immune function in European starlings, Sturnus vulgaris, flown in a wind tunnel. Specifically, we predicted that constitutive immune function decreases in response to training and, additionally, in response to immediate exercise. We compared constitutive immune function among three groups: (1) 'untrained' birds that were kept in cages and were not flown; (2) 'trained' birds that received flight training over a 15 day period and performed a 1-4 h continuous flight, after which they rested for 48 h before being sampled; and (3) 'post-flight' birds that differed from the 'trained' group only in being sampled immediately after the final flight. A bird in our trained group represents an individual during migration that has been resting between migratory flights for at least 2 days. A bird in our post-flight group represents an individual that has just completed a migratory flight and has not yet had time to recover. Three of our four indicators (haptoglobin, agglutination and lysis) showed the predicted decrease in immune function in the post-flight group, and two indicators (haptoglobin, agglutination) showed the predicted decreasing trend from the untrained to trained to post-flight group. Haptoglobin levels were negatively correlated with flight duration. No effect of training or flight was detected on leukocyte profiles. Our results suggest that in European starlings, constitutive immune function is decreased more as a result of immediate exercise than of exercise training. Because of the recent emergence of avian-borne diseases, understanding the trade-offs and challenges faced by long-distance migrants has gained a new level of relevance and urgency.","Nebel, Silke; Bauchinger, Ulf; Buehler, Deborah M; Langlois, Lillie A; Boyles, Michelle; Gerson, Alexander R; Price, Edwin R; McWilliams, Scott R; Guglielmo, Christopher G",The Journal of experimental biology,10,19

The most debated issue is the risk of complications related to the use of the prosthesis, which are thought to be the cause of higher dysphagia. PATIENTS AND METHODS From January 2004 to December 2007, 198 consecutive patients underwent laparoscopic fundoplication for gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) with or without hiatal hernia. Fifty patients (25.3%) presented a giant hiatal hernia, defined as a hiatal defect over 5 cm. These 50 patients underwent primary simple suture of the crura and additional reinforcement with a Crurasoft mesh (Bard). Hiatal hernia or GERD symptoms recurrence, dysphagia, and mesh-related complications were investigated. RESULTS Of the 50 patients undergoing mesh repair, there were 32 women and 18 men with a mean age of 63.2 years. Conversion rate was 2%. Intraoperative complications rate was 6%, all of them laparoscopically managed. Postoperative complications occurred in 1 patient (2%). Mortality rate was 2%. Median postoperative stay was 3 days. Median follow-up was 62 months. Two percent of the patients presented wrap migration, and 4% presented dysphagia. Six percent of cases presented recurrence of GERD manifestations. There have been no complications related to the use of the mesh. CONCLUSIONS Laparoscopic antireflux surgery with a prosthetic mesh in cases of giant hiatal hernia is an effective and safe procedure, reducing the rate of postoperative hernia recurrence during long-term follow-up. The incidence of mesh-related complications is very low.","Priego, Pablo; Ruiz-Tovar, Jaime; Pérez de Oteyza, Joaquín",Journal of laparoendoscopic & advanced surgical techniques. Part A,10,24

Rapid diagnosis of COVID-19 is vital to control the spreading of the disease, which however is challenged by limited detection capacity and low detection efficiency in many parts of the world. The pooling test may offer an economical and effective approach to increase virus testing capacity of medical laboratories without requiring more laboratory resources such as laboratory workers, testing reagents and equipment. In this study, the sample pools of 6 and 10 were detected by a real-time Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) assay targeting ORF1ab and N genes of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Each pool consisted of 5 or 9 negative SARS-CoV-2 samples and 1 positive counterpart with varying viral loads. Two different strategies of sample pooling were investigated and the results were compared comprehensively. One approach was to pool viral transport medium (VTM) of the samples in the laboratory, and the other was to pool swab samples during collection process. For swab pooling strategy, qualitative results of SARS-CoV-2 RNA, specific tests of ORF1ab and N genes, remained stable over the different pool sizes. Together, this study demonstrates that the swab pooling strategy may serve as an effective and economical approach for screening SARS-CoV-2 infections in large populations, especially in countries and regions where medical resources are limited during the pandemic and may thus be potential for clinical laboratory applications.

Some Carnivorans may harbor comparatively fewer impediments. For example, in contrast to mice, the domestic cat genome encodes essential nonreceptor HIV-1 dependency factors. All Feliformia species and at least one Caniformia species also lack a major lentiviral restriction mechanism (TRIM5α/TRIMCyp proteins). Here we investigated cells from two species in another carnivore family, the Mustelidae, for permissiveness to the HIV-1 life cycle. Mustela putorius furo (domesticated ferret) primary cells and cell lines did not restrict HIV-1, feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV), equine infectious anemia virus (EIAV), or N-tropic murine leukemia virus (MLV) postentry and supported late HIV-1 life cycle steps comparably to human cells. The ferret TRIM5α gene exon 8, which encodes the B30.2 domain, was found to be pseudogenized. Strikingly, ferret (but not mink) cells engineered to express human HIV-1 entry receptors supported productive spreading replication, amplification, and serial passage of wild-type HIV-1. Nevertheless, produced virions had relatively reduced infectivity and the virus accrued G→A hypermutations, consistent with APOBEC3 protein pressure. Ferret cell-passaged HIV-1 also evolved amino acid changes in the capsid cyclophilin A binding loop. We conclude that the genome of this carnivore can provide essential nonreceptor HIV-1 dependency factors and that ferret APOBEC3 proteins with activity against HIV-1 are likely. Even so, unlike in cat cells, HIV-1 can replicate in ferret cells without vif substitution. The virus evolves in this novel nonprimate cell adaptive landscape. We suggest that further characterization of HIV-1 adaptation in ferret cells and delineation of Mustelidae restriction factor repertoires are warranted, with a view to the potential for an HIV-1 animal model.","Fadel, Hind J; Saenz, Dyana T; Guevara, Rebekah; von Messling, Veronika; Peretz, Mary; Poeschla, Eric M",Journal of virology,10,29

We investigated the impact of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy on regional cerebral tissue oxygenation (rSO2). MATERIALS AND METHODS In total, 40 extubated surgical intensive care unit patients requiring classic oxygen therapy (COT) for acute respiratory failure were examined. Near-infrared spectroscopy (INVOS 5100C, Covidien) was used for 30 minutes to detect bilateral rSO2 during COT via facemask (6 L/min) and CPAP therapy (40% fraction of inspired oxygen, 8 cm H2O CPAP) using a randomized crossover study design. Patients served as their own control. Continuous hemodynamic routine monitoring and blood gas analysis were performed. The effect of CPAP therapy on rSO2 and influence of assessed covariables were investigated using a mixed linear model. RESULTS Median rSO2 increased from 57.9% (95% confidence interval [CI], 54.2-61.5) during COT to 62.8% (95% CI, 59.2-66.5) during CPAP therapy (P<0.0001). The estimated difference from the mixed model between COT and CPAP is -5.0 (95% CI, -6.3 to -3.7). Median arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide decreased from 47.8±5.1 mm Hg during COT to 43.1±5 mm Hg during CPAP (P<0.001), whereas arterial partial pressure of oxygen remained unchanged (P=0.329). In total, 23% of patients had SO2 levels <50%, with a higher prevalence under COT. CONCLUSIONS Our results reveal that CPAP therapy compared with COT may influence rSO2 in patients with acute respiratory failure. However, the cause of the rSO2 increase following CPAP application remains to be elucidated, and the accuracy of cerebral oximetry during CPAP therapy in patients with acute respiratory failure remains questionable.","Doerr, Claudius; Kietaibl, Clemens; Doerr, Katharina; Hagmann, Michael; Baumann, Lukas; Kimberger, Oliver; Ullrich, Roman; Markstaller, Klaus; Klein, Klaus U",Journal of neurosurgical anesthesiology,10,17

AIMS This study investigated cultural differences in the effects of expressive suppression, whilst watching a traumatic film, on subjective distress, psychophysiological responses and intrusive memory. METHOD Australians of European heritage or East Asian Australian participants (n = 82) were randomly assigned to either a suppression group (instructed to suppress their emotions during the film) or a control group (no instructions regarding emotion management). Electrodermal activity, heart rate and heart rate variability (root mean square of the successive differences; RMSSD) were measured pre-, during and post-film. Participants reported the number of film-related intrusions in the 5 min and 7 days post-viewing. RESULTS While the European Australian group did not differ significantly on RMSSD, the East Asian suppression group scored significantly higher on RMSSD during the film than the East Asian control group. Second, those in the suppression groups, regardless of cultural background, reported significantly fewer intrusions immediately post-film than controls. Third, we found that for the European Australian group, change in heart rate interacted with group (control versus suppression) when predicting weekly intrusions. However, for the East Asian group change in heart rate did not interact with group when predicting weekly intrusions.

The association remained consistent after further adjustment for several risk factors (HR 1.13; 95% CI 0.96-1.33). The corresponding adjusted HRs were 1.24 (95% CI: 0.87-1.77) and 1.28 (95% CI: 0.87-1.88), respectively, when comparing the extreme tertiles of CRF levels. Previous studies mostly reported no evidence of an association or an increased risk of prostate cancer in relation to high CRF. Studies reporting positive associations had short-term follow-up durations (<10 years). CONCLUSIONS Primary data and a review of previous studies suggest that elevated CRF is not associated with reduced prostate cancer risk. Previous findings of significant evidence of associations could be attributed to increased screening and detection as well as reverse causation bias.","Kunutsor, Setor K; Voutilainen, Ari; Laukkanen, Jari A",European journal of clinical investigation,10,24

Among the peculiar characteristics of their biological vision are that they have two types of foveae; one shallow fovea used in their binocular vision, and a deep fovea for monocular vision. The deep fovea allows these birds to see objects at long distances and to identify them as possible prey. Inspired by the biological functioning of the deep fovea a model called DeepFoveaNet is proposed in this paper. DeepFoveaNet is a convolutional neural network model to detect moving objects in video sequences. DeepFoveaNet emulates the monocular vision of birds of prey through two Encoder-Decoder convolutional neural network modules. This model combines the capacity of magnification of the deep fovea and the context information of the peripheral vision. Unlike algorithms to detect moving objects, ranked in the first places of the Change Detection database (CDnet14), DeepFoveaNet does not depend on previously trained neural networks, neither on a huge number of training images for its training. Besides, its architecture allows it to learn spatiotemporal information of the video. DeepFoveaNet was evaluated in the CDnet14 database achieving high performance and was ranked as one of the ten best algorithms. The characteristics and results of DeepFoveaNet demonstrated that the model is comparable to the state-of-the-art algorithms to detect moving objects, and it can detect very small moving objects through its deep fovea model that other algorithms cannot detect.","Guzman-Pando, Abimael; Chacon-Murguia, Mario I",IEEE transactions on image processing : a publication of the IEEE Signal Processing Society,10,28

KT aims to understand how evidence use can best be promoted and supported through different activities. For dissemination activities, infographics are gaining in popularity as a promising KT tool to reach multiple health research users (eg, health practitioners, patients and families, decision-makers). However, to our knowledge, no study has yet mapped the available evidence on this tool using a systematic method. This scoping review will explore the depth and breadth of evidence on infographics use and its effectiveness in improving research uptake (eg, raising awareness, influencing attitudes, increasing knowledge, informing practice and changing behaviour). METHODS AND ANALYSIS We will use the scoping review methodological framework first proposed by Arksey and O'Malley (2005), improved by Levac et al, and further refined by the Joanna Briggs Institute (2020). The search will be conducted in MEDLINE, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, PsycINFO, Social Science Abstracts, Library and Information Science Abstracts, Education Resources Information Center, Cairn and Google Scholar. We will also search for relevant literature from the reference lists of the included publications. Two independent reviewers will select the studies. All study designs will be eligible for inclusion, with no date or publication status restrictions. The included studies will have evaluated infographics that disseminate health research evidence and target a non-scientific audience. A data extraction form will be developed and used to extract and chart the data, which will then be synthesised to present a descriptive summary of the results. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION Ethics approval is not required. To inform the research and KT communities, various dissemination activities will be developed, including user-friendly KT tools (eg, webinars, fact sheets and infographics), open-access publication and presentations at KT events and conferences.","Mc Sween-Cadieux, Esther; Chabot, Catherine; Fillol, Amandine; Saha, Trisha; Dagenais, Christian",BMJ open,10,1

To determine how interprofessional education (IPE) in pharmacy has been studied, namely which disciplines have engaged in IPE research initiatives, the research methodologies that have been used, and what journals have published in this area.Findings. In the 145 IPE studies included in the review, the authors represented 13 different disciplines (3.2±1.5 disciplines per study). Pharmacy authors most commonly published with co-authors from nursing, medicine, and health management and support and most frequently served as first author or last author. The IPE activities involved 4.0 student disciplines (SD = 1.9) and 211.8 students (SD = 280.1), and most commonly included nursing (n = 104, 71.7%), medicine (n = 102, 70.3%), and health management and support students (n = 50, 34.5%). Most studies did not include an author from each student discipline involved in the IPE (n = 88, 60.7%). Further, a majority of studies used nonrandomized groupings (n = 103, 71.0%) with quantitative data (n = 74, 51.0%) and most were published in an interprofessional journal (n = 65, 44.8%) or pharmacy-specific journal (n = 45, 31.0%).Summary.

We present a child with symptoms of rickets as the first clinical sign of a central giant cell granuloma (CGCG) with high serum levels of FGF23, a hormone associated with decreased phosphate resorption. A 3-year-old boy presented with a limp and 6 months later with painless growth of the jaw. On examination gingival hypertrophy and genu varum were observed. Investigations revealed hypophosphatemia, normal 1,25 and 25 (OH) vitamin D, and high alkaline phosphatase. An MRI showed an osteolytic lesion of the maxilla. Radiographs revealed typical rachitic findings. Incisional biopsy of the tumor revealed a CGCG with mesenchymal matrix. The CGCG was initially treated with calcitonin, but the lesions continued to grow, making it necessary to perform tracheostomy and gastrostomy. One year after onset the hyperphosphaturia worsened, necessitating increasing oral phosphate supplements up to 100 mg/kg per day of elemental phosphorus. FGF23 levels were extremely high. Total removal of the tumor was impossible, and partial reduction was achieved after percutaneous computed tomography-guided radiofrequency, local instillation of triamcinolone, and oral propranolol. Compassionate use of cinacalcet was unsuccessful in preventing phosphaturia. The tumor slowly regressed after the third year of disease; phosphaturia improved, allowing the tapering of phosphate supplements, and FGF23 levels normalized. Tumor-induced osteomalacia/rickets is uncommon in children and is challenging for physicians to diagnose. It should be suspected in patients with intractable osteomalacia or rickets. A tumor should be ruled out if FGF23 levels are high.","Fernández-Cooke, Elisa; Cruz-Rojo, Jaime; Gallego, Carmen; Romance, Ana Isabel; Mosqueda-Peña, Rocio; Almaden, Yolanda; Sánchez del Pozo, Jaime",Pediatrics,10,33

High-performance liquid chromatography was used to determine the content of the Sudan dyes. The parameters affecting the extraction performance were studied and optimized, including the amount of the adsorbent and inorganic salt, type and the volume of the eluent, pH of the sample solution and extraction time. Under the optimized experimental conditions, the results show that the proposed method has a good linear relationship (r≥ 0.9993). The limits of detection range from 0.88 μg L-1 to 1.27 μg L-1. The recoveries range from 86.6% to 99.7% with the relative standard deviations ranging from 0.6% to 7.9% in the methodology validation.

Using data from the Randomized Trial of Revascularization With Solitaire FR Device Versus Best Medical Therapy in the Treatment of Acute Stroke due to Anterior Circulation Large Vessel Occlusion Presenting Within 8-Hours of Symptom Onset (REVASCAT) and a parallel reperfusion treatment registry, we sought to assess the utilization of EVT in a defined patient population, comparing the outcomes of patients treated in and outside the REVASCAT trial. METHODS SONIIA [Sistema Online d'Informació de l'Ictus Agut], a population-based, government-mandated, prospective registry of reperfusion therapies for stroke encompassing the entire population of Catalonia, was used as data source. The registry documents 5 key inclusion criteria of the REVASCAT trial: age, stroke severity, time to treatment, baseline functional status, and occlusion site. We compared procedural, safety, and functional outcomes in patients treated inside and outside the trial. RESULTS From November 2012 to December 2014, out of 17596 ischemic stroke patients in Catalonia (population 7.5 million), 2576 patients received reperfusion therapies (17/100000 inhabitants-year), mainly intravenous thrombolysis only (2036). From the remaining 540 treated with EVT, 103 patients (out of 206 randomized) were treated within REVASCAT and 437 outside the trial. Of these, 399 did not fulfill some of the study criteria, and 38 were trial candidates (8 treated at REVASCAT centers and 30 at 2 non-REVASCAT centers). The majority of procedural, safety, and functional outcomes were similar in patients treated with EVT within and outside REVASCAT. CONCLUSIONS REVASCAT enrolled nearly all eligible patients representing one third of all patients treated with EVT. Patients treated with EVT within and outside REVASCAT had similar outcomes, reinforcing the therapeutic value of EVT. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION URL: http://www.clinicaltrials.gov.

Moreover, they have important implications for how the treatment is imagined, implemented and funded. Service provision which follows engagement in an intensive (usually residential) program is often called 'aftercare' in the international AOD field. In this commentary, we argue that the term 'aftercare' fails to articulate the nature of ongoing care required by people who are managing AOD use. We maintain that 'aftercare' positions post-residential care as being less important than other treatment modalities, rather than as integral to a continuum of care. It is a term that implies that care should be acute, like much treatment delivered through a medical model, and assumes that people follow linear pathways in managing their AOD use. Assumptions embedded in the term 'aftercare' such as these may disincline governments from funding ongoing services for people exiting intensive programs. Alternative terms including 'continuing coordinated care' more aptly signal the integrated and ongoing service provision that should be available to support people in sustaining changes initiated through other AOD interventions.","MacLean, Sarah J; Caluzzi, Gabriel; Ferry, Mark; Bruun, Andrew; Skattebol, Jennifer; Neale, Joanne; Bryant, Joanne",Drug and alcohol review,10,27

It is uncertain if this approach benefits patients with LDL-C near 70 mg/dL. Lipoprotein(a) levels may influence residual risk. OBJECTIVES In a post hoc analysis of the ODYSSEY Outcomes (Evaluation of Cardiovascular Outcomes After an Acute Coronary Syndrome During Treatment With Alirocumab) trial, the authors evaluated the benefit of adding the proprotein subtilisin/kexin type 9 inhibitor alirocumab to optimized statin treatment in patients with LDL-C levels near 70 mg/dL. Effects were evaluated according to concurrent lipoprotein(a) levels. METHODS ODYSSEY Outcomes compared alirocumab with placebo in 18,924 patients with recent acute coronary syndromes receiving optimized statin treatment. In 4,351 patients (23.0%), screening or randomization LDL-C was <70 mg/dL (median 69.4 mg/dL; interquartile range: 64.3-74.0 mg/dL); in 14,573 patients (77.0%), both determinations were ≥70 mg/dL (median 94.0 mg/dL; interquartile range: 83.2-111.0 mg/dL). RESULTS In the lower LDL-C subgroup, MACE rates were 4.2 and 3.1 per 100 patient-years among placebo-treated patients with baseline lipoprotein(a) greater than or less than or equal to the median (13.7 mg/dL). Corresponding adjusted treatment hazard ratios were 0.68 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.52-0.90) and 1.11 (95% CI: 0.83-1.49), with treatment-lipoprotein(a) interaction on MACE (Pinteraction = 0.017). In the higher LDL-C subgroup, MACE rates were 4.7 and 3.8 per 100 patient-years among placebo-treated patients with lipoprotein(a) >13.7 mg/dL or ≤13.7 mg/dL; corresponding adjusted treatment hazard ratios were 0.82 (95% CI: 0.72-0.92) and 0.89 (95% CI: 0.75-1.06), with Pinteraction = 0.43. CONCLUSIONS In patients with recent acute coronary syndromes and LDL-C near 70 mg/dL on optimized statin therapy, proprotein subtilisin/kexin type 9 inhibition provides incremental clinical benefit only when lipoprotein(a) concentration is at least mildly elevated.

We utilized a risk-stratified approach to allow for early recognition and isolation of potential COVID-19 infection in surgical patients, ensuring continuity of surgical services during a COVID-19 outbreak. Patients and Methods: Over a four-month period from January to April 2020, surgical patients admitted with concurrent respiratory symptom, infiltrates on chest imaging, or suspicious travel/epidemiologic history were placed in a dedicated ward in which they were tested for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). If emergency operations were necessary prior to the exclusion of COVID-19, patients were managed as per suspected cases of COVID-19, with appropriate precautions and full personal protective equipment (PPE). Results: From January through April 2020, a total of 8,437 patients were admitted to our surgical department; 5.9% (498/8437) required peri-operative testing for SARS-CoV-2. Because testing was in-house with turnaround within 24 hours, only a small number of emergency operations (n = 10) were conducted for suspected COVID-19 cases prior to results; none tested positive. The testing yield was lower in surgical inpatients compared with medical inpatients (odds ratio [OR] = 0.20, 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.12-0.32, p < 0.001). Three operations were conducted in known COVID-19 cases; all healthcare workers (HCWs) used full PPE. A risk-stratified testing strategy picked up previously unsuspected COVID-19 in six cases; 66.7% (4/6) were asymptomatic at presentation. Although 48 HCWs were exposed to these six cases, delayed diagnosis was averted and no evidence of spread to patients or HCWs was detected. Conclusion: A risk-stratified approach allowed for early recognition, testing, and isolation of potential COVID-19 infection in surgical patients, ensuring continuity of surgical services.","Wee, Liang En; Sim, Xiang Ying Jean; Conceicao, Edwin Philip; Aung, May Kyawt; Wong, Hei Man; Teh, Yii Ean; Tan, Kwee Yuen; Wijaya, Limin; Tan, Tan Ban Hock; Ling, Moi Lin; Venkatachalam, Indumathi",Surgical infections,10,1

Individually selecting vessels with a microcatheter can be time-consuming and difficult, especially when multiple branches are present in the treatment zone. This article describes a technique to perform an ""inverse"" embolization-protection of the selected vessel and embolization of the unselected vessels-a technique that has not yet been described. MATERIALS AND METHODS Two cases of hepatic chemoembolization that would require subselection of multiple branch vessels using conventional technique are reported. In both cases the proper hepatic artery was selected with a soft, nondissecting neurovascular guide catheter. The nontarget hepatic vessel was selected with a neurovascular microcatheter occlusion balloon, and the balloon was inflated to protect that vessel. Embolization to multiple target vessels was then achieved by way of a single injection through the guide catheter. RESULTS Both procedures were technically successful without complication. Postembolization angiography confirmed normal parenchymal enhancement in the protected zone and expected paucity of enhancement in the treated zone. CONCLUSION Temporary distal balloon occlusion is a useful technique to treat multiple artery branches with a single injection in cases where individual selection of the branches is difficult or time-consuming. Further study of this technique is warranted.","Itagaki, Michael W",Cardiovascular and interventional radiology,10,16

Iso-osmolal iodixanol (290 mOsm/kg H2O) infusion demonstrated smaller infarcts and less intracranial hemorrhage compared with low-osmolal iopamidol and saline. No studies comparing iodinated radiographic contrast media in human stroke have been performed, to our knowledge. We hypothesized that low-osmolal contrast media may be associated with worse outcomes compared with iodixanol in the Interventional Management of Stroke III Trial (IMS III). MATERIALS AND METHODS We reviewed prospective iodinated radiographic contrast media data for 133 M1 occlusions treated with endovascular therapy. We compared 5 prespecified efficacy and safety end points (mRS 0-2 outcome, modified TICI 2b-3 reperfusion, asymptomatic and symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage, and mortality) between those receiving iodixanol (n = 31) or low-osmolal contrast media (n = 102). Variables imbalanced between iodinated radiographic contrast media types or associated with outcome were considered potential covariates for the adjusted models. In addition to the iodinated radiographic contrast media type, final covariates were those selected by using the stepwise method in a logistic regression model. Adjusted relative risks were then estimated by using a log-link regression model. RESULTS Of baseline or endovascular therapy variables potentially linked to outcome, prior antiplatelet agent use was more common and microcatheter iodinated radiographic contrast media injections were fewer with iodixanol. Relative risk point estimates are in favor of iodixanol for the 5 prespecified end points with M1 occlusion. The percentage of risk differences are numerically greater for microcatheter injections with iodixanol. CONCLUSIONS While data favoring the use of iso-osmolal iodixanol for reperfusion of M1 occlusion following IV rtPA are inconclusive, potential pathophysiologic mechanisms suggesting clinical benefit warrant further investigation.","Tomsick, T A; Foster, L D; Liebeskind, D S; Hill, M D; Carrozella, J; Goyal, M; von Kummer, R; Demchuk, A M; Dzialowski, I; Puetz, V; Jovin, T; Morales, H; Palesch, Y Y; Broderick, J; Khatri, P; Yeatts, S D",AJNR.

METHODS The homes of 100 smokers and 50 non-smokers were visited before the residents moved out. Dust, surfaces, air and participants' fingers were measured for nicotine and children's urine samples were analysed for cotinine. The new residents who moved into these homes were recruited if they were non-smokers. Dust, surfaces, air and new residents' fingers were examined for nicotine in 25 former smoker and 16 former non-smoker homes. A urine sample was collected from the youngest resident. RESULTS Smoker homes' dust, surface and air nicotine levels decreased after the change of occupancy (p<0.001); however dust and surfaces showed higher contamination levels in former smoker homes than former non-smoker homes (p<0.05). Non-smoking participants' finger nicotine was higher in former smoker homes compared to former non-smoker homes (p<0.05). Finger nicotine levels among non-smokers living in former smoker homes were significantly correlated with dust and surface nicotine and urine cotinine. CONCLUSIONS These findings indicate that THS accumulates in smokers' homes and persists when smokers move out even after homes remain vacant for 2 months and are cleaned and prepared for new residents. When non-smokers move into homes formerly occupied by smokers, they encounter indoor environments with THS polluted surfaces and dust. Results suggest that non-smokers living in former smoker homes are exposed to THS in dust and on surfaces.","Matt, Georg E; Quintana, Penelope J E; Zakarian, Joy M; Fortmann, Addie L; Chatfield, Dale A; Hoh, Eunha; Uribe, Anna M; Hovell, Melbourne F",Tobacco control,10,16

METHODS Children's perceptions of SARS-CoV-2 were evaluated by asking 103 French children, aged 5 to 17 years old, first to draw a coronavirus and then to identify SARS-CoV-2 in a series of 16 images during summer 2020. RESULTS One hundred three children were included in the study, either during outpatient visits at the hospital (in Marseille and Paris) or through the authors' social network, and were grouped in terms of age, parents' occupation, mode of recruitment, and recollection of having previously seen a representation of a coronavirus. Half of the children drew the coronavirus as circular in shape, and almost all included a crownlike feature. One-third of the drawings had anthropomorphic features. Although the pictorial representations of the virus were fairly accurate overall, the children's interpretations of the crownlike structure were imaginative. The explanations the children gave for their drawings were in some cases surprising. Among the 16 pictures they were shown, the children correctly identified those of SARS-CoV-2, other than the electron micrograph, in more than two-thirds of cases. CONCLUSIONS Children of all ages, even the youngest, and both sexes had a relatively accurate perception of SARS-CoV-2, as evaluated through their drawings and their ability to recognize it among other pictures. The children's drawings of the coronavirus were colorful and had a less frightening tone than expected in the light of media coverage, suggesting that they had developed coping mechanisms.","Martinerie, Laetitia; Bernoux, Delphine; Giovannin-Chami, Lisa; Fabre, Alexandre",Pediatrics,10,8

Twenty-one participants took part. All individuals completed 2 repetitions each of 4 different plank exercises that consisted of a floor based plank, or planks with arms suspended, feet suspended, or feet and arms suspended using a TRX Suspension System. During plank performance, muscle activation was recorded from rectus abdominis, external oblique, rectus femoris, and serratus anterior (SA) muscles using electromyography. All planks were performed for a total of 3 seconds. Resulting muscle activation data were amplitude normalized, and root mean square activation was then determined over the full 3 second duration of the exercise. A significant main effect of plank type was found for all muscles. Post hoc analysis and effect size examination indicated that abdominal muscle activation was higher in all suspended conditions compared to the floor based plank. The highest level of abdominal muscle activation occurred in the arms suspended and arms/feet suspended conditions, which did not differ from one another. Rectus femoris activation was greatest during the arms suspended condition, whereas SA activity peaked during normal and feet suspended planks. These results indicate that suspension training as performed in this study seems to be an effective means of increasing muscle activation during the plank exercise. Contrary to expectations, the additional instability created by suspending both the arms and feet did not result in any additional abdominal muscle activation. These findings have implications in prescription and progression of core muscle training programs.","Byrne, Jeannette M; Bishop, Nicole S; Caines, Andrew M; Crane, Kalynn A; Feaver, Ashley M; Pearcey, Gregory E P",Journal of strength and conditioning research,10,12

The study hypothesizes that the cumulative number of confirmed COVID-19 patients depends on the urban population, rural population, number of persons older than 50, population density, and poverty rate. A log-linear model is used to test the stated hypothesis, with the cumulative number of confirmed COVID-19 patients up to period t as a dependent variable and demographic factors as an independent variable. The policy effectiveness indicator is calculated by taking the difference of the COVID rank of the ith state based on the predicted model and the actual COVID rank of the ith state. Our study finds that the urban population significantly impacts the spread of COVID-19. On the other hand, demographic factors such as rural population, density, and age structure do not impact the spread of COVID-19 significantly. Thus, people residing in urban areas face a significant threat of COVID-19 as compared to people in rural areas.","Pandey, Ashutosh; Saxena, Nitin Kishore","International journal of health services : planning, administration, evaluation",10,24

However, prolonged wearing of protective respirators, medical and fabric masks can easily generate excessive sweating, moisture and friction. Closed and warm environments heighten the skin's permeability and sensitivity to physical or chemical irritants, leading to chronic cumulative irritant contact dermatitis or, rarely, even allergic contact dermatitis (ACD). Although not representing a life-threatening condition, contact dermatitis can have a significant impact on emergency management, as it is potentially able to reduce work performance and create emotional discomfort due to the involvement of evident body areas. In order to minimize the skin breakdown, adherence to standards on wearing protective and safe equipments and avoidance of over-protection should be performed. At the same time, some measures of skin care are recommended. Here, we offer some tips on how to prevent and manage contact dermatitis due to masks not only in healthcare workers but also in the general population during this COVID-19 outbreak.

However, current derivation methods remain inefficient, heterogeneous, and cell line dependent. To address these issues, we first devised a strategy to efficiently cluster hPSC-derived pancreatic progenitors into 3D structures. Through a systematic study, we discovered 10 chemicals that not only retain the pancreatic progenitors in 3D clusters but also enhance their potentiality towards NKX6.1+/INS+ β cells. We further systematically screened signaling pathway modulators in the three steps from pancreatic progenitors toward β cells. The implementation of all these strategies and chemical combinations resulted in generating β cells from different sources of hPSCs with high efficiency. The derived β cells are functional and can reverse hyperglycemia in mice within two weeks. Our protocol provides a robust platform for studying human β cells and developing hPSC-derived β cells for cell replacement therapy.","Liu, Haisong; Li, Ronghui; Liao, Hsin-Kai; Min, Zheying; Wang, Chao; Yu, Yang; Shi, Lei; Dan, Jiameng; Hayek, Alberto; Martinez Martinez, Llanos; Nuñez Delicado, Estrella; Izpisua Belmonte, Juan Carlos",Nature communications,10,26
86532,86532,86532,Recent advances in benign gynecological laparoscopic surgery.,11.496674,5.594463,2021,"BACKGROUND In India, Out-of-pocket expenses accounts for about 62.6% of total health expenditure - one of the highest in the world. Lack of health insurance coverage and inadequate coverage are important reasons for high out-of-pocket health expenditures. There are many Public Health Insurance Programs offered by the Government that cover the cost of hospitalization for the people below poverty line (BPL), but their coverage is still not complete. The objective of this research is to examine the effect of Public Health Insurance Programs for the Poor on hospitalizations and inpatient Out-of-Pocket costs. METHODS Data from the recent national survey by the National Sample Survey Organization, Social Consumption in Health 2014 are used. Propensity score matching was used to identify comparable non-enrolled individuals for individuals enrolled in health insurance programs. Binary logistic regression model, Tobit model, and a Two-part model were used to study the effects of enrolment under Public Health Insurance Programs for the Poor on the incidence of hospitalizations, length of hospitalization, and Out-of- Pocket payments for inpatient care. RESULTS There were 64,270 BPL people in the sample. Individuals enrolled in health insurance for the poor have 1.21 higher odds of incidence of hospitalization compared to matched poor individuals without the health insurance coverage. Enrollment under the poor people health insurance program did not have any effect on length of hospitalization and inpatient Out-of-Pocket health expenditures. Logistic regression model showed that chronic illness, household size, and age of the individual had significant effects on hospitalization incidence. Tobit model results showed that individuals who had chronic illnesses and belonging to other backward social group had significant effects on hospital length of stay. Tobit model showed that days of hospital stay, education and age of patient, using a private hospital for treatment, admission in a paying ward, and having some specific comorbidities had significant positive effect on out-of-pocket costs. CONCLUSIONS Enrolment in the public health insurance programs for the poor increased the utilization of inpatient health care. Health insurance coverage should be expanded to cover outpatient services to discourage overutilization of inpatient services. To reduce out-of-pocket costs, insurance needs to cover all family members rather than restricting coverage to a specific maximum defined.","Sriram, Shyamkumar; Khan, M Mahmud",BMC health services research,10,12

In these units, healthcare workers encounter daily work stressors which impact on their health and well-being. Also, previous literature revealed a passion for caring among these workers, finding two types: harmonious passion, which may protect them against negative outcomes, and obsessive passion, which may boost negative consequences. We aim to study whether both types of passion could moderate the relationships between daily work stressors and STS. METHODS In all, 265 assessments were collected at ICUs from different hospitals in Spain through a diary approach (53 health workers × 5 days at two time points per day). RESULTS First, daily work stressors were positive predictors of symptomatology; secondly, dispositional harmonious passion was a negative predictor of both compassion fatigue and shattered assumptions, also presenting a buffering effect between daily work stressors and daily shattered assumptions. Finally, dispositional obsessive passion showed positive relationships with both shattered assumptions and symptomatology, also presenting a boosting effect between daily work stressors and daily symptomatology. CONCLUSIONS This study allows us to deepen our understanding of STS in ICUs and to boost preventive proposals.

Although stress has been investigated during this pandemic, there are no reports on anxiety in neurosurgical patients undergoing nonurgent surgical procedures. METHODS Neurosurgical patients admitted to hospitals in eastern Lombardy for nonurgent surgery after the lockdown prospectively completed a pre- and postoperative structured questionnaire. Recorded data included demographics, pathology, time on surgical waiting list, anxiety related to COVID-19, primary pathology and surgery, safety perception during hospital admission before and after surgery, and surgical outcomes. Anxiety was measured with the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory. Descriptive statistics were computed on the different variables and data were stratified according to pathology (oncological vs nononcological). Three different models were used to investigate which variables had the greatest impact on anxiety, oncological patients, and safety perception, respectively. Because the variables (Xs) were of a different nature (qualitative and quantitative), mostly asymmetrical, and related to outcome (Y) by nonlinear relationships, a machine learning approach composed of three steps (1, random forest growing; 2, relative variable importance measure; and 3, partial dependence plots) was chosen. RESULTS One hundred twenty-three patients from 10 different hospitals were included in the study. None of the patients developed COVID-19 after surgery. State and trait anxiety were reported by 30.3% and 18.9% of patients, respectively. Higher values of state anxiety were documented in oncological compared to nononcological patients (46.7% vs 25%; p = 0.055). Anxiety was strongly associated with worry about primary pathology, surgery, disease worsening, and with stress during waiting time, as expected. Worry about positivity to SARS-CoV-2, however, was the strongest factor associated with anxiety, even though none of the patients were infected. Neuro-oncological disease was associated with state anxiety and with worry about surgery and COVID-19. Increased bed distance and availability of hand sanitizer were associated with a feeling of safety. CONCLUSIONS These data underline the importance of psychological support, especially for neuro-oncological patients, during a pandemic.","Doglietto, Francesco; Vezzoli, Marika; Biroli, Antonio; Saraceno, Giorgio; Zanin, Luca; Pertichetti, Marta; Calza, Stefano; Agosti, Edoardo; Aliaga Arias, Jahard Mijail; Assietti, Roberto; Bellocchi, Silvio; Bernucci, Claudio; Bistazzoni, Simona; Bongetta, Daniele; Fanti, Andrea; Fioravanti, Antonio; Fiorindi, Alessandro; Franzin, Alberto; Locatelli, Davide; Pugliese, Raffaelino; Roca, Elena; Sicuri, Giovanni Marco; Stefini, Roberto; Venturini, Martina; Vivaldi, Oscar; Zattra, Costanza; Zoia, Cesare; Fontanella, Marco Maria",Neurosurgical focus,10,16

While the outcomes of PEH repair have improved largely due to the proliferation of laparoscopic surgery, there is still a defined rate of morbidity and mortality. We sought to characterize the outcomes of both elective and emergent PEH repair using a large population-based data set. METHODS The Nationwide Inpatient Sample was queried for primary ICD-9 codes associated with PEH repair (years 2006-2008). Outcomes were in-hospital mortality and the occurrence of a pre-identified complication. Multivariate analysis was performed to determine the risk factors for complications and mortality following both elective and emergent PEH repair. RESULTS A total of 8,462 records in the data, representing 41,723 patients in the US undergoing PEH repair in the study interval, were identified. Of these procedures, 74.2% was elective and 42.4% was laparoscopic. The overall complication and mortality rates were 20.8 and 1.1%, respectively. Emergent repair was associated with a higher rate of morbidity (33.4 vs. 16.5%, p < 0.001) and mortality (3.2 vs. 0.37%, p < 0.001) than elective repair. Emergent repair patients were more likely to be male, were older, and more likely to be minority. Logistic modeling revealed that younger age, elective case status, and a laparoscopic approach were independently associated with a lower probability of complications and mortality. CONCLUSIONS Patients undergoing emergent PEH repair in the United States tend to be older, more likely a racial minority, and less likely to undergo laparoscopic repair. Elective repair, younger age, and a laparoscopic approach are associated with improved outcomes. Considering all of the above, we recommend that patients consider elective repair with a surgeon experienced in the laparoscopic approach, especially when symptoms related to the hernia are present.","Jassim, Hassanain; Seligman, Johnathan T; Frelich, Matthew; Goldblatt, Matthew; Kastenmeier, Andrew; Wallace, James; Zhao, Heather S; Szabo, Aniko; Gould, Jon C",Surgical endoscopy,10,16

We sought to characterize the direct and indirect impacts of COVID-19 on this group to understand how the pandemic has affected this group, this group's public health response to COVID-19, and whether there were differences by race/ethnicity. METHODS This study recruited its sample from a drug treatment setting in the northeast region of the United States. We surveyed 110 individuals on methadone as treatment for OUD and assessed COVID-19-related impacts on their health behaviors and other indices of social, physical, and mental well-being, including sexual health behaviors, substance use, mental health status, health care access, income, and employment. RESULTS Our findings highlight overall increases in depression, anxiety, loneliness, and frustration among the sample of people with OUD; the study also observed decreases in financial stability. Significant differences between groups indicated a greater financial burden among racial-ethnic minorities; this subgroup also reported greater direct adverse effects of COVID-19, including being more concerned about contracting COVID-19, not being able to get a COVID-19 test, and knowing someone who had died from COVID-19. A greater proportion of Whites indicated increases in alcohol consumption and non-prescription drug use than did racial-ethnic minorities. CONCLUSIONS Treatment providers must be vigilant in managing direct and indirect outcomes of COVID-19 among people with OUD.

We describe the clinical characteristics of hospitalized children with 2009 influenza A (H1N1) infection in Shenzhen, China, November-December 2009. METHODS Using a standardized form, we collected data on 148 hospitalized children. 2009 influenza A (H1N1) infection was confirmed in nasopharyngeal swab specimens with the use of a real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction assay. RESULTS Of the 148 hospitalized children with 2009 influenza A (H1N1) infection, 81 (55%) were 5 years of age or older and 85% of the patients were previously healthy. The common presenting symptoms were fever (94%), cough (89%), runny nose (36.5%), vomiting (24%), sore throat (19.6%), wheezing (18%), abdominal pain (16%), mental status changes (9%), seizures (6%), diarrhea (6%), myalgia (6%), and chest pain (4%). Twenty-nine (20%) patients were admitted to an ICU, 10 (7%) patients required mechanical ventilation. The overall complication rate was 65.5%, they were pneumonia in 94 (64%), neurologic complications in 18 (12%), parapneumonic effusion in 12 (8%) and myocarditis in 7 (5%). One hundred seven (72%) patients received oseltamivir treatment, 34 (23%) received within 48 hr after the onset of symptoms. All patients received antibiotics before admission or on admission. One hundred forty-four (97%) patients were discharged; four (3%) previously healthy patients died, three died from severe encephalopathy, one died from secondary fungal meningitis.

We aimed to systematically review the quality and reliability of available ultrasound [US] indices compared with reference standards for grading disease activity in IBD patients. Methods Pubmed, Embase and Medline were searched for relevant literature published within the period 1990 to June 2017. Relevant publications were identified through full text review after initial screening by two investigators. Data on methodology and index characteristics were collected. Study quality was assessed using a modified version of the Quadas-2 tool for risk of bias assessment. Results Of 20 studies with an US index, 11 studies met the inclusion criteria. Out of these 11 studies, 7 and 4 studied Crohn's disease [CD] and ulcerative colitis [UC0 activity indices, respectively. Parameters that were used in these indices included bowel wall thickness [BWT], Doppler signal [DS], wall layer stratification [WLS], compressibility, peristalsis, haustrations, fatty wrapping, contrast enhancement [CE], and strain pattern. Study quality was graded high in 5 studies, moderate in 3 studies and low in 3 studies. Ileocolonoscopy was used as the reference standard in 9 studies. In 1 study a combined index of ileocolonoscopy and barium contrast radiography and in 1 study histology was used as the reference standard. Only 5 studies used an established endoscopic index for comparison with US. Conclusions Several US indices for assessing disease activity in IBD are available; however, the methodology for development was suboptimal in most studies. For the development of future indices, stringent methodological design is required.","Bots, S; Nylund, K; Löwenberg, M; Gecse, K; Gilja, O H; D'Haens, G",Journal of Crohn's & colitis,10,1

However, white light imaging (WLI) is the principal technology used in clinical CE at present, and therefore, CE is limited to mucosal inspection, with diagnosis remaining reliant on visible manifestations of disease. The introduction of WLI CE has motivated a wide range of research to improve its diagnostic capabilities through integration with other sensing modalities. These developments have the potential to overcome the limitations of WLI through enhanced detection of subtle mucosal microlesions and submucosal and/or transmural pathology, providing novel diagnostic avenues. Other research aims to utilize a range of sensors to measure physiological parameters or to discover new biomarkers to improve the sensitivity, specificity and thus the clinical utility of CE. This multidisciplinary Review summarizes research into non-WLI CE devices by organizing them into a taxonomic structure on the basis of their sensing modality.

This study examined (1) the feasibility of recruiting HGG patients to an exercise-based study and performing fitness assessments; (2) exercise counseling and programming preferences; and (3) associations between fitness, physical activity (PA), and quality of life (QOL). METHODS Participants completed assessments prior to starting Temozolamide chemotherapy with radiation (T1), at 2 months and 8 months. Fitness was measured with an incremental cycling exercise test to volitional exhaustion (VO2peak) and hand grip dynamometry. The Godin leisure time questionnaire measured PA and the functional assessment for cancer therapy, brain cancer module (FACT-Br) measured QOL. RESULTS Of the 35 approached, N = 16 participated. Due to safety concerns, the aerobic fitness test protocol was altered. Participants preferred to exercise during treatment, alone and unsupervised, at home, and at a moderate intensity. Few participants (<25%) met guidelines for PA at any time point. At T1, aerobic capacity was associated with the FACT Trial Outcome Index (TOI) (r = 0.619, p < 0.05). At 2 months, PA minutes were associated with FACT-TOI (r = 0.653, p = 0.057), FACT-G (r = 0.711, p < 0.05), and FACT-Br scores (r = 0.722, p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS Recruitment rate was similar to a previous study in HGG populations, but study completion rate was lower.

DESIGN A retrospective analysis. SETTING An academic hospital. PARTICIPANTS Patients older than 18 years of age undergoing thoracic surgery requiring DLT placement between 2005 and 2011. INTERVENTIONS Patients without airway predictors of difficult intubation who were intubated under DL with Macintosh (DL-MAC, n = 40) or Miller (DL-MIL, n = 44) blades and VL with McGrath MAC (Aircraft Medical, Edinburgh, UK) and C-MAC (Karl Storz, Tuttlingen, Germany) laryngoscopes (n = 46) were included in the study. Patients who were intubated with both VL devices were grouped into a VL group. MEASUREMENTS Patients in all 3 groups had comparable preoperative demographics. Mallampati scores and ease of manual ventilation after the induction of anesthesia were also similar in all groups. The Cormack Lehane (C-L) grade views were significantly higher in patients in the DL-MAC than in the DL-MIL and VL groups (p < 0.006). The number of intubation attempts was similar in all 3 groups; however, the percentage of intubation reported to be difficult was higher in the DL-MAC than in the other 2 groups (p = 0.014). No damage to the airway was found in any of the groups. CONCLUSION DLT placement using VL appeared to overcome some of the limitations of DL-MAC but was similar to DL-MIL. The authors speculated that the ease of placement was related to the improved visualization of the vocal cords because there was a significantly greater number of C-L views 3 and 4 in the DL-MAC group as compared with the VL and DL-MIL groups. Hence, the authors advocate using VL, particularly when the laryngoscopist is inexperienced using DL-MIL for DLT placement.","Purugganan, Ronaldo V; Jackson, Timothy A; Heir, Jagtar Singh; Wang, Hao; Cata, Juan P",Journal of cardiothoracic and vascular anesthesia,10,20

With the effects of COVID-19 pandemic on social security schemes and individuals' income, dependent older people's needs are critically at stake. Like other developing countries, older people in Ghana need to rely on their social networks through family ties, friends and social organisations for support. Also, there is the need for social security institutions, including the Social Security and National insurance Trust, to make provisions for older people aged 50+ to receive part of their pension package to meet their basic needs during the pandemic. In a period like this, social services are required as older people may need practical support in terms of having someone to run errands for them. However, government should improve social intervention package, particularly the livelihood empowerment against poverty grant for older adults with very low income in order to enhance their living conditions.","Arthur-Holmes, Francis; Agyemang-Duah, Williams",Journal of gerontological social work,10,1

We assessed the incidence of hepatic abscess after thermal ablation in a BEA cohort treated with extended antibiotic regimens following ablation. MATERIALS AND METHODS Retrospective review was performed to identify patients with BEA who underwent percutaneous hepatic thermal ablation between January 1, 2003-September 1, 2016. Fifteen patients with BEA underwent 18 percutaneous thermal ablation procedures. Patient and procedural characteristics were reviewed, as well as the antibiotic regiment utilized post ablation. Complications were characterized via standardized nomenclature [Common Terminology for Clinically Adverse Events (CTCAE) v4.03]. RESULTS Fifteen patients with BEA underwent treatment of 49 liver lesions during 18 ablation sessions. Mean follow-up in these patients was 39 months (range 3-138 months). Two patients (11%) developed hepatic abscesses, both of which occurred within 45 days of the ablation procedure while the patients were still on extended prophylactic antibiotic therapy. No additional CTCAE clinically significant complications were observed. CONCLUSION Thermal ablation of hepatic tumors can be accomplished safely in patients with BEA. Long-term post-procedural antibiotics may mitigate the risk of hepatic abscess formation. Due to the high number of patients who are deemed surgically unresectable, patients with BEA may have limited alternate treatment modalities and percutaneous hepatic thermal ablative treatments warrant consideration.","Welch, B T; Schmitz, J J; Atwell, T D; McGauvran, A M; Kurup, A N; Callstrom, M R; Schmit, G D",Abdominal radiology,10,5

Little is known about the role of the 2D:4D ratio in relation to serum and urinary androgens for physical performance in female athletes. We aimed to compare the 2D:4D ratio in female Olympic athletes with sedentary controls, and to investigate the 2D:4D ratio in relation to serum and urinary androgens and physical performance in the athletes. Methods: This cross-sectional study included 104 Swedish female Olympic athletes participating in power, endurance and technical sports and 117 sedentary controls. The 2D:4D ratio was calculated using direct digit measurements. Serum androgens and urinary androgen metabolites were analyzed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. The athletes performed standardized physical performance tests and body composition was established by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. Results: The 2D:4D ratio was significantly lower in the athletes compared with controls although serum testosterone levels were comparable between groups and within normal reference values. The 2D:4D ratio correlated negatively with urinary levels of testosterone glucuronide and 5α- and 5βAdiol-17G, whereas there were no correlations to serum androgen levels. Furthermore, the 2D:4D ratio correlated negatively with strength tests and positively with 3,000-meter running in the athletes. Conclusion: Female Olympic athletes had a lower 2D:4D ratio, possibly reflecting a higher prenatal androgen exposure, than sedentary controls. Furthermore, the 2D:4D ratio was related to urinary levels of androgen metabolites and physical performance in the athletes but not to serum androgen levels. It is suggested that the 2D:4D ratio could reflect androgen metabolism and may be of importance for sporting success in female athletes.","Eklund, Emma; Ekström, Lena; Thörngren, John-Olof; Ericsson, Magnus; Berglund, Bo; Hirschberg, Angelica Lindén",Frontiers in endocrinology,10,23

PURPOSE The purpose of this qualitative study was to investigate and compare 3 different impression techniques for osseointegrated dental implant transfer procedures. MATERIAL AND METHODS Three impression transfer approaches were evaluated and compared: closed-tray impression technique (CTT), impression with plastic snap-fit impression copings; open-tray impression technique (OTT), impression with independent square copings; and OTT joining the impression copings with a photo-polymerized resin (PPT). A reference acrylic resin model with 4 implants was fabricated. Polyvinyl siloxane with a stock tray was used to make 45 impressions (n=15 for each impression technique), and 45 die definitive stone casts. A computer-aided design and computer-aided manufacturing (CAD-CAM) titanium framework was fabricated on the reference model. Three blinded operators evaluated the fit of the CAD-CAM titanium framework on each model to find clinically acceptable fit. The Kappa test was used for the agreement between the examiners (α=.05). RESULTS Agreement was found among the 3 examiners on 44 of 45 specimens (Kappa value= 0.939; P<.001). In the CTT group, 14 casts were found to be acceptable. In the OTT group, nearly half of the specimens produced unacceptable fitting casts, whereas in the PPT group, 13 casts were found acceptable.

It is often a change in the individual's normal behavior that informs owners and veterinarians of the possibility of illness, pain and stress/distress. There is ample evidence in the feline literature that medical and behavioral health go hand in hand. In most feline cases, medical and behavioral conditions contribute concurrently to clinical signs. Clinical challenges: Our domestic cats do not express change in physiological and emotional states in a way that is easily recognized. Therefore, it can be difficult to diagnose medical and behavioral illnesses and ascertain contributions from each one to the final diagnosis. When various levels of stress are present, especially distress, this compromises behavioral and physical health, and influences treatment outcomes. AIMS This review is intended to help veterinarians recognize physical and behavioral changes associated with acute stress through to chronic distress, including stress-associated diseases. An emphasis on thorough history-taking will allow the clinician to ascertain which signs are behavioral and which are medical, with the understanding that they are not mutually exclusive. Equally important is the contribution of pain, chronic disease and poor environmental situations to behavioral changes and the expression of medical disorders. Evidence base: There is an increasing amount of evidence that stress and distress have profound effects on feline health, behavior and welfare.

Although green walls efficiently realize a healthy indoor environment, few studies have analyzed their impact on occupants based on the visual element of green walls. This study measures the emotional impact, task performance, and task load of the subjects according to four virtual experiments (a non-green wall, a freestanding green wall, two freestanding green walls, and a full-sized green wall). The results of the four experiments are as follows: (i) The visual elements of the green wall had an emotional impact on the occupants, which was verified through the Friedman test; (ii) the effect of the visual elements of the green wall on the task performance of the occupants was not verified by the one-way repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA); and (iii) the task load of the occupants influenced their task performance, which was verified by the repeated-measures ANOVA. This study can help determine the optimal type and area of green walls by considering their impact on the occupants as well as on the economic and constructional aspects of the indoor space.","Yeom, Seungkeun; Kim, Hakpyeong; Hong, Taehoon; Ji, Changyoon; Lee, Dong-Eun",Indoor air,10,9

MATERIAL AND METHODS A retrospective review of ocular emergency patients who attended the inpatient unit of the Department of Ophthalmology of Saarland University, Homburg/Saar, Germany during the COVID-19 pandemic, between 1 March and 30 April 2020, in comparison to the same time period in 2019. For each subject, clinical history and surgical reports were reviewed. After 24 March 2020, PCR examinations for SARS-CoV-2 were performed from throat swab specimens in all patients using real-time RT-PCR. RESULTS Totally, 135 patients were admitted in 2019 and 115 patients in 2020 as emergency cases. The patient age at the time of admission did not differ significantly between the two time periods (63.6 ± 17.9 years vs. 62.5 ± 19.6 years) (p = 0.792), but the average length of hospital stays increased significantly for 2020 (4.0 ± 3.6 vs. 4.4 ± 2.7 days, p = 0.043). The percentage of admissions due to acute corneal hydrops (0% vs. 3.5%) increased significantly from 2019 to 2020 (χ2 = 4.772, p = 0.028), however, there was not a significant difference between the two years for any other diagnosis (χ2 ≤ 3.564, p ≥ 0.059). From 2019 to 2020, the percentage of acute intravitreal anti-VEGF injections decreased significantly (7.9% vs. 1.3%, χ2 = 3.985, p = 0.045), but the proportion of other emergency surgeries did not differ between the two years (χ2 ≤ 3.617, p ≥ 0.057). COVID-19 PCR examination was performed in 66 (57.4%) cases in 2020 and all samples (100%) were negative. CONCLUSIONS The COVID pandemic did not change emergency inpatient volume in our department, but duration of hospital stay was extended on average by 8 hours, mainly due to additional COVID-19-PCR examinations. The proportion of the most frequently performed surgeries did not change remarkably between 2019 and 2020, but with the introduction of Muraine's sutures in 2019, the percentage of admissions with acute corneal hydrops (with or without subsequent surgery) increased for 2020. No urgent surgery had to be postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic at our department; all operations were performed successfully.","Tóth, Gábor; Xanthopoulou, Kassandra; Stachon, Tanja; Németh, János; Hécz, Réka; Berkó-Göttel, Barbara; Pfuhl, Thorsten; Smola, Sigrun; Seitz, Berthold; Szentmáry, Nóra",Klinische Monatsblatter fur Augenheilkunde,10,33

METHODS A literature search was conducted on laparoendoscopic single-site surgery, minilaparoscopy, needlescopy and microlaparoscopy. The most relevant papers were selected over the last 30 years. RESULTS 830 manuscripts were found about LESS, 251 in urology, two CRTs and nine match-case controls. 258 papers were about ML and 55 in urology. ML is the main topic (169 papers), followed by needlescopy (58) and microlaparoscopy (32). The most significant articles are four non-randomized match-case control studies. CONCLUSIONS Over the last few years, many urological laparoscopic operations have been successfully performed by LESS. However, the actual role of LESS remains to be determined with controversial data about postoperative pain control and almost no results on cosmesis. We are facing second-generation ML with superior performance granted by new endoscopes and most effective instruments. ML has demonstrated in almost all urologic indications to be feasible, safe and able to improve cosmetic and postoperative pain control.

As of July 7th, 2020, almost seven months into the outbreak, there are no approved vaccines and few treatments available. Developing drugs that target multiple points in the viral life cycle could serve as a strategy to tackle the current as well as future coronavirus pandemics. Here we leverage the power of our recently developed in silico screening platform, VirtualFlow, to identify inhibitors that target SARS-CoV-2. VirtualFlow is able to efficiently harness the power of computing clusters and cloud-based computing platforms to carry out ultra-large scale virtual screens. In this unprecedented structure-based multi-target virtual screening campaign, we have used VirtualFlow to screen an average of approximately 1 billion molecules against each of 40 different target sites on 17 different potential viral and host targets in the cloud. In addition to targeting the active sites of viral enzymes, we also target critical auxiliary sites such as functionally important protein-protein interaction interfaces. This multi-target approach not only increases the likelihood of finding a potent inhibitor, but could also help identify a collection of anti-coronavirus drugs that would retain efficacy in the face of viral mutation. Drugs belonging to different regimen classes could be combined to develop possible combination therapies, and top hits that bind at highly conserved sites would be potential candidates for further development as coronavirus drugs. Here, we present the top 200 in silico hits for each target site. While in-house experimental validation of some of these compounds is currently underway, we want to make this array of potential inhibitor candidates available to researchers worldwide in consideration of the pressing need for fast-tracked drug development.","Gorgulla, Christoph; PadmanabhaDas, Krishna; Leigh, Kendra E; Cespugli, Marco; Fischer, Patrick D; Wang, Zi-Fu; Tesseyre, Guilhem; Pandita, Shreya; Shnapir, Alec; Calderaio, Anthony; Hutcheson, Colin; Gechev, Minko; Rose, Alexander; Lewis, Noam; Yaffe, Erez; Luxenburg, Roni; Herce, Henry D; Durmaz, Vedat; Halazonetis, Thanos D; Fackeldey, Konstantin; Patten, Justin J; Chuprina, Alexander; Dziuba, Igor; Plekhova, Alla; Moroz, Yurii; Radchenko, Dmytro; Tarkhanova, Olga; Yavnyuk, Irina; Gruber, Christian C; Yust, Ryan; Payne, Dave; Näär, Anders M; Namchuk, Mark N; Davey, Robert A; Wagner, Gerhard; Kinney, Jamie; Arthanari, Haribabu",ChemRxiv : the preprint server for chemistry,10,1

Cu-PABA@Lac had great potential to maintain stability due to the protection of the Cu-PABA shell and reasonable conformational changes. In addition, Cu-PABA@Lac could be used repeatedly by centrifugation, as confirmed in the degradation experiment of bisphenol A (BPA). Because of the synergistic effect of copper ions between laccase and Cu-PABA, the Km value decreased (from 0.0024 to 0.0014 mM); therefore, the affinity between laccase and guaiacol was enhanced.

However, the exact mechanisms of injury to the central nervous system (CNS) during flavivirus infections remain poorly understood. Microglia are the resident immune cells of the CNS and are important for multiple functions, including control of viral pathogenesis. Utilizing a pharmacologic method of microglia depletion (PLX5622 [Plexxikon Inc.], an inhibitor of colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor), we sought to determine the role of microglia in flaviviral pathogenesis. Depletion of microglia resulted in increased mortality and viral titer in the brain following infection with either West Nile virus (WNV) or Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV). Interestingly, microglial depletion did not prevent virus-induced increases in the expression of relevant cytokines and chemokines at the mRNA level. In fact, the expression of several proinflammatory genes was increased in virus-infected, microglia-depleted mice compared to virus-infected, untreated controls. In contrast, and as expected, expression of the macrophage marker triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2) was decreased in virus-infected, PLX5622-treated mice compared to virus-infected controls.IMPORTANCE As CNS invasion by flaviviruses is a rare but life-threatening event, it is critical to understand how brain-resident immune cells elicit protection or injury during disease progression. Microglia have been shown to be important in viral clearance but may also contribute to CNS injury as part of the neuroinflammatory process. By utilizing a microglial depletion model, we can begin to parse out the exact roles of microglia during flaviviral pathogenesis with hopes of understanding specific mechanisms as potential targets for therapeutics.","Seitz, Scott; Clarke, Penny; Tyler, Kenneth L",Journal of virology,10,16

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS Based on data from the German Diabetes Prospective Follow-up Registry (DPV), we compared data from 715 children, adolescents, and young adults, newly diagnosed with type 1 diabetes during the COVID-19 pandemic in Germany between 1 March and 30 June 2020, with data from 5,428 children, adolescents, and young adults of the same periods from 2011 to 2019. Adjusted differences and relative risks (RRs) of negative β-cell autoantibody test results and diabetic ketoacidosis were estimated using multivariable log-binomial regression analysis. An upper noninferiority test (margin 1%) was applied to evaluate whether the autoantibody-negativity rate in 2020 was not higher than that in 2011 to 2019. RESULTS The estimated frequencies of autoantibody negativity in 2020 and 2011-2019 were 6.6% (95% CI 5.1-8.4) and 7.2% (95% CI 6.5-8.0), respectively, with an absolute difference of -0.68% (90% CI -2.07 to 0.71; P upper noninferiority = 0.023). The increase of the estimated frequency of diabetic ketoacidosis during the COVID-19 pandemic was similar between autoantibody-negative and -positive type 1 diabetes (adjusted RRs 1.28 [95% CI 0.80-2.05] and 1.57 [1.41-1.75], respectively). CONCLUSIONS This study found no evidence that the COVID-19 pandemic leads to a significantly increased number of new cases with autoantibody-negative type 1 diabetes in children, adolescents, and young adults. In addition, autoantibody-negative type 1 diabetes showed no particular susceptibility to ketoacidosis, neither before nor during the pandemic.","Kamrath, Clemens; Rosenbauer, Joachim; Tittel, Sascha R; Warncke, Katharina; Hirtz, Raphael; Denzer, Christian; Dost, Axel; Neu, Andreas; Pacaud, Danièle; Holl, Reinhard W",Diabetes care,10,0

Findings from the American Nurses Association Health Risk Appraisal suggested that nurses give the best patient care when they are operating at the peak of their own wellness. They also revealed that 68% of the surveyed nurses place their patients' health, safety, and wellness before their own. Globally, several nursing codes of ethics include the requirement of self-care. Often, these codes embed the responsibility to protect and promote one's own health within the clearly described obligation to provide safe patient care. The American Nurses Association Code of Ethics for Nurses is unique in that it states explicitly that nurses must adopt self-care as a duty to self in addition to their duty to provide care to patients. One of the basic assumptions of Watson's Philosophy and Science of Caring is that caring science is the essence of nursing and the foundational disciplinary core of the profession. Watson's theory of human caring provides support for the engagement in self-care. Two important value assumptions of Watson's Caritas are that ""we have to learn how to offer caring, love, forgiveness, compassion, and mercy to ourselves before we can offer authentic caring and love to others"" and we also must ""treat ourselves with loving-kindness and equanimity, gentleness, and dignity before we can accept, respect, and care for others within a professional caring-healing model."" Embedded within several caritas processes is an outline for a holistic approach to caring for self and others that can guide nurses to improve their mental, physical, emotional, and spiritual health.","Linton, Mary; Koonmen, Jamie",Nursing ethics,10,1

Here we reflect on how our integrated organisational model has faced the first impact of the pandemic and describe what challenges, opportunities and lessons have emerged. MATERIALS AND METHODS The organisational model of the Catalan Blood and Tissue Bank (Banc de Sang i Teixits, BST) is described. The new scenario was managed by following international recommendations and considering the pandemic in a context of volatility, uncertainty, complexity, and ambiguity (VUCA), allowing rapid measures to be taken. These aimed to: ensure donor safety, promote proper responses to patients' needs, ensure the health and well-being of personnel, and prepare for future scenarios. RESULTS The BST has adapted its activities to the changes in demand. No shortage of any product or service occurred. Donor acceptance, safety and wellbeing were maintained except for tissue donation, which almost completely stopped. To support the health system, several activities have been promoted: large-scale convalescent plasma (CP) production, clinical trials with CP and mesenchymal stromal cells, massive COVID-19 diagnoses, and participation in co-operative research and publications. Haemovigilance is running smoothly and no adverse effects have been detected among donors or patients. DISCUSSION Several elements have proven to be critical when addressing the pandemic scenario: a) the early creation of a crisis committee in combination with technical recommendations and the recognition of a VUCA scenario; b) identification of the strategies described; c) the integrated donor-to-patient organisational model; d) active Research and Development (R&D); and e) the flexibility of the staff. It is essential to underline the importance of the need for centralised management, effective contingency strategies, and early collaboration with peers.","Garcia-Lopez, Joan; Delgadillo, Joaquin; Vilarrodona, Anna; Querol, Sergi; Ovejo, Joan; Coll, Ruth; Millan, Anna; Madrigal, Alejandro; Soria, Gloria; Vidal, Francisco; Vives, Joaquim; Herrero, María J; Lopez, Isabel; Sauleda, Silvia; Contreras, Enric; Grifols, Joan Ramon; Guasch, Rosa; Tahull, Elisabet; Puig, Lluís; Masip, Aurora; Argelagués, Enric; Muñiz-Diaz, Eduardo",Blood transfusion = Trasfusione del sangue,10,1

MATERIALS AND METHODS Matched-pair study comparing perioperative outcomes, postoperative visual analogue pain scale (VAPS) and morbidity of 2-port (n = 20) and 4-port (n = 10) laparoscopic reconstructive urological surgery. Preoperative and perioperative data compared included demographics, type of surgery, operative time, blood loss, decrease in serum hemoglobin, operative complications, length of stay and postoperative complications according to Clavien-Dindo classification. RESULTS There was no significant difference between groups regarding age, gender, body mass index, American Society of Anesthesiologists score, type of surgery, operative time, operative complications and intraoperative or postoperative transfusion. Estimated blood loss was lower using reduced-port approach. VAPS at postoperative day one was significantly lower for 2-port approach and so was the length of stay. Patient satisfaction with the wound was higher for 2-port surgery. Differences were not observed in number and severity of postoperative complications. CONCLUSIONS Urological reconstructive operations can be safely performed using the hybrid laparoendoscopic single-site umbilical approach, resulting in lower blood loss, higher patient satisfaction and lower postoperative pain, which also facilitate earlier hospital discharge, than the same reconstructive procedures performed through multiport conventional laparoscopy.","Angulo, Javier C; Pérez, Sergio; García-Tello, Ana; Redondo, Cristina; Meilán, Elisa; Arance, Ignacio",Urologia internationalis,10,8

We investigated whether combinations of endoscopic techniques and laparoscopic techniques could be performed more safely and rapidly. MATERIAL AND METHODS Laparoscopic and endoscopic cooperative-cholecystectomy (LEC-chole) and conventional laparoscopic cholecystectomy (Lapa-chole) were performed in six dogs. Operation time was defined as the time from the creation of the first port to the retrieval of the resected gallbladder (GB); and GB bed dissection time was the time from local injection of natural saline to the clipping of the cystic duct. The main roles of the endoscope in LEC-chole were to obtain a sufficient cutting space via local injection of natural saline to the GB bed and to monitor the operative view without laparoscopic camera, thus omitting the umbilical port. RESULTS The operation times were 60 ± 18.3 minutes for LEC-chole and 95 ± 7.0 for Lapa-chole (p = .036). The GB bed dissection times were 31 ± 8.54 minutes in LEC-chole and 50.6 ± 7.37 minutes in Lapa-chole (p = 0.048). There were significant differences in liver damage and bleeding (p = 0.116), but there were no significant differences in one-month survival. CONCLUSIONS The application of LEC-chole may be expanded to cholecystectomy.","Kobayashi, Nobuya; Mori, Hirohito; Kobara, Hideki; Nishiyama, Noriko; Fujiwara, Masao; Okano, Keiichi; Suzuki, Yasuyuki; Masaki, Tsutomu",Minimally invasive therapy & allied technologies : MITAT : official journal of the Society for Minimally Invasive Therapy,10,27

Ultraviolet-C wavelength is a promising way of decontamination, however adequate dosimetry is needed to ensure balance between over and underexposed areas and provide reliable results. Our study demonstrates that UVGI light irradiance varies significantly on different respirator angles and propose a method to decontaminate several masks at once ensuring appropriate dosage in shaded zones. An UVGI irradiator was built with internal dimensions of 69.5 × 55 × 33 cm with three 15 W UV lamps. Inside, a grating of 58 × 41 × 15 cm was placed to hold the masks. Two different flat fold respirator models were used to assess irradiance, four of model Aura 9322 3 M of dimensions 17 × 9 × 4 cm (tri-fold), and two of model SAFE 231FFP3NR (bi-fold) with dimensions 17 × 6 × 5 cm. An STN-SilverNova spectrometer was employed to verify wavelength spectrum and surface irradiance. A simulation was performed to find the irradiance pattern inside the box and the six masks placed inside. These simulations were carried out using the software DIALUX EVO 8.2. The data obtained reveal that the irradiance received inside the manufactured UVGI-irradiator depends not only on the distance between the lamps' plane and the base of the respirators but also on the orientation and shape of the masks. This point becomes relevant to assure that all the respirators inside the chamber receive the correct dosage. Irradiance over FFR surfaces depend on several factors such as distance and angle of incidence of the light source. Careful irradiance measurement and simulation can ensure reliable dosage in the whole mask surface, balancing overexposure. Closed box systems might provide a more reliable, reproducible UVGI dosage than open settings.","Baluja, Aurora; Arines, Justo; Vilanova, Ramón; Cortiñas, Julio; Bao-Varela, Carmen; Flores-Arias, Maria Teresa",Journal of occupational and environmental hygiene,10,12

However, hospitalist perspectives on the COVID-19 vaccine and potential differences between APPs and physicians are unknown. Understanding hospitalist perspectives could help to address vaccine hesitancy among patients. METHODS We conducted an online survey of hospitalists at Mayo Clinic sites in Arizona, Florida, Minnesota, and Wisconsin from December 14, 2020, through January 4, 2021. We collected demographic information and assessed perspectives on the COVID-19 vaccine and, for comparison, on the influenza vaccine. Descriptive statistics were used to compare responses between APPs and physicians. RESULTS The overall response rate was 42.7% (n=128/300) and comprised of 53.9% women (n=69/128) and 41.4% APPs (n=53/128). Most hospitalists reported receiving or planning to receive vaccination against COVID-19 (93.7%; n=119/128) and influenza (97.7%; n=125/128). Most hospitalists reported they would advise 100% of patients to receive the COVID-19 vaccine (66% for APPs; 74.7% for physicians) and influenza vaccine (83% for APPs; 80% for physicians). Barriers to recommending the COVID-19 vaccine included patient health status and vaccine safety profile. Hospitalists reported that patients and co-workers receiving the COVID-19 vaccine would reduce their anxiety (~80% of hospitalists), social isolation (~64% of hospitalists), and improve their emotional support (~40% of hospitalists). APP and physician responses were similar. The possible reduction in social isolation was associated with higher odds of hospitalists advising all patients to receive the COVID-19 vaccine (adjusted odds ratio 2.95 [95% confidence interval, 1.32-6.59]; P<.008), whereas hospitalist age, gender, and profession showed no association. CONCLUSION Most hospitalists would reportedly advise patients to receive the COVID-19 vaccine. Barriers to this recommendation included patient health status and vaccine safety. Hospitalists are an important resource to provide patient education and reduce COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy.","Dugani, Sagar B; Geyer, Holly L; Maniaci, Michael J; Fischer, Karen M; Croghan, Ivana T; Coons, Trevor J; Canan, Elizabeth L; Burton, M Caroline",Hospital practice,10,1

Eight healthy males completed stationary cycling trials at 70% peak oxygen uptake until exhaustion in an environmental chamber maintained at 30°C with 50% relative humidity. Three solar radiation conditions, 0, 250 and 500 W/m2, were tested using a ceiling-mounted solar simulator (metal-halide lamps) over a 3 × 2 m irradiated area. IR-Tty and rectal temperature (Tre) were similar before and during exercise in each trial (P > 0.05). Spearman's rank correlation coefficient (rs) demonstrated very strong (250 W/m2, rs = 0.87) and strong (0 W/m2, rs = 0.73; 500 W/m2, rs = 0.78) correlations between IR-Tty and Tre in all trials (P < 0.001). A Bland-Altman plot showed that mean differences (SD; 95% limits of agreement; root mean square error) between IR-Tty and Tre were - 0.11°C (0.46; - 1.00 to 0.78°C; 0.43 ± 0.16°C) in 0 W/m2, - 0.13°C (0.32; - 0.77 to 0.50°C; 0.32 ± 0.10°C) in 250 W/m2 and - 0.03°C (0.60; - 1.21 to 1.14°C; 0.46 ± 0.27°C) in 500 W/m2. A positive correlation was found in 500 W/m2 (rs = 0.51; P < 0.001) but not in 250 W/m2 (rs = 0.04; P = 0.762) and 0 W/m2 (rs = 0.04; P = 0.732), indicating a greater elevation in IR-Tty than Tre in 500 W/m2. Percentage of target attainment within ± 0.3°C between IR-Tty and Tre was higher in 250 W/m2 (100 ± 0%) than 0 (93 ± 7%) and 500 (90 ± 10%; P < 0.05) W/m2. IR-Tty is acceptable for core temperature monitoring during exercise in the heat when solar radiation is ≤ 500 W/m2, and its accuracy increases when solar radiation is 250 W/m2 under our study conditions.","Otani, Hidenori; Kaya, Mitsuharu; Tamaki, Akira; Hosokawa, Yuri; Lee, Jason K W",International journal of biometeorology,10,19

METHOD Prospective data collection was conducted during a four-week time period and a total sum of 160 working hours for each of the two 1.5 T MRI scanners. Three core processes defined the value stream of patient handling before, during and after the MRI examination: i) Scheduling & Registration, ii) Organization & Preparation, and iii) MR scan. Quantitative data was collected for six essential time intervals of the MRI workflow. RESULTS A total of 302 MRI examinations were assessed. The workflow analysis revealed that effective utilization of scan capacity during operating hours varied by scanner (Scanner 1: 77 % / Scanner 2: 85 %). Mean process times for were: patient preparation time 18.9 min (±15.1) p = 0.11, scan preparation time 5.7 min (±4.0) p = 0,015, effective scan time 39.6 min (±18.0) p < 0.0001, scan room occupation time 50.9 min (±21.0) p < 0.0001, clean-up time 5.6 min (±3.2) p = 0.001, total patient handling time 69.7 min (±26.3) p < 0.0001, turnover time 13.4 min (±21.4) p = 0.65. CONCLUSIONS This study demonstrates the utility and applicability of a standardized core processes analyses for MRI scanning, which identified underutilization of scanning capacities, related to multiple factors, such as punctuality of patients, the number of same day cancellations, the process of placing an IV access and patient transport contribute to underutilization of MRI scanners. Furthermore, proactive patient management and effective communication with patients and referring physicians might have relevant time saving potential in the scan room.","Streit, Ulrike; Uhlig, Johannes; Lotz, Joachim; Panahi, Babak; Seif Amir Hosseini, Ali",European journal of radiology,10,1

Between January 2018 and July 2019, 16 patients with recurrent VVF were injected with PRP in a tertiary gynecological department. Subsequently, a surgical Latzko procedure for VVF closure was scheduled 6-8 weeks after the PRP injection allowing proper neovascularization and remodeling of surrounding tissues. Patients were considered cured if no leakage was observed after surgery and negative dye test results were indicated at follow-up. All patients who were examined therein remained dry. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study aiming to assess PRP injections as a supporting treatment prior to surgical procedure for recurrent VVF. Preliminary results are encouraging, and we incorporated this method in our clinical practice.

However, the iterative participatory design process required to produce effective pictograms can be costly in terms of money, time, and effort. Crowdsourcing has been applied to bring down the costs of the participatory design process, but the feasibility of using this approach with older adults remains largely unknown. OBJECTIVES To evaluate the feasibility of using Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk), a leading crowdsourcing platform, for participatory pictogram evaluation with older adults (55+) and to evaluate the comprehensibility of USP pictogram, identify common misinterpretations, and explore the relationship between selected participant characteristics and their pictogram comprehension performance. METHODS 108 older adults (56.5% female; 57-80 years of age) were recruited via MTurk to complete a cross-sectional online survey that asked them to interpret 15 USP pictograms and answer questions about their health and health literacy. RESULTS It was feasible to perform pictogram evaluation with older adults on MTurk, as shown by ease of recruitment and high data quality. Of the 15 pictograms tested, seven (46.7%) resulted in a comprehensibility score below the threshold established by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI), eight (53.3%) elicited common misinterpretations, and two (13.3%) resulted in ANSI-defined ""critical confusion."" Age (P = 0.04) was associated with pictogram comprehension performance. Certain issues with the pictogram subtitles emerged during the evaluation. CONCLUSIONS MTurk is a feasible platform for participatory pictogram evaluation, even for a sole target of older adults. The USP should develop a pictogram user manual, redesign pictograms confusing to older adults, and establish policies and procedures to ensure that pictogram subtitles conform to evidence-based best practices and standards for patient-centered written drug information.","Lin, Shih-Yin; Thompson, Hilaire J; Hart, Laura A; Fu, Musetta C C; Demiris, George",Research in social & administrative pharmacy : RSAP,10,1

Our goal was to decipher the effect of hypothermic total liquid ventilation on the systemic and cerebral response to asphyxial cardiac arrest using an original pressure- and volume-controlled ventilation strategy in rabbits. DESIGN Randomized animal study. SETTING Academic research laboratory. SUBJECTS New Zealand Rabbits. INTERVENTIONS Thirty-six rabbits were submitted to 13 minutes of asphyxia, leading to cardiac arrest. After resumption of spontaneous circulation, they underwent either normothermic life support (control group, n = 12) or hypothermia induced by either 30 minutes of total liquid ventilation (total liquid ventilation group, n = 12) or IV cold saline (conventional cooling group, n = 12). MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS Ultrafast cooling with total liquid ventilation (32 °C within 5 min in the esophagus) dramatically attenuated the post-cardiac arrest syndrome regarding survival, neurologic dysfunction, and histologic lesions (brain, heart, kidneys, liver, and lungs). Final survival rate achieved 58% versus 0% and 8% in total liquid ventilation, control, and conventional cooling groups (p < 0.05), respectively. This was accompanied by an early preservation of the blood-brain barrier integrity and cerebral hemodynamics as well as reduction in the immediate reactive oxygen species production in the brain, heart, and kidneys after cardiac arrest. Later on, total liquid ventilation also mitigated the systemic inflammatory response through alteration of monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, interleukin-1β, and interleukin-8 transcripts levels compared with control. In the conventional cooling group, cooling was achieved more slowly (32 °C within 90-120 min in the esophagus), providing none of the above-mentioned systemic or organ protection. CONCLUSIONS Ultrafast cooling by total liquid ventilation limits the post-cardiac arrest syndrome after asphyxial cardiac arrest in rabbits. This protection involves an early limitation in reactive oxidative species production, blood-brain barrier disruption, and delayed preservation against the systemic inflammatory response.","Kohlhauer, Matthias; Lidouren, Fanny; Remy-Jouet, Isabelle; Mongardon, Nicolas; Adam, Clovis; Bruneval, Patrick; Hocini, Hakim; Levy, Yves; Blengio, Fabiola; Carli, Pierre; Vivien, Benoit; Ricard, Jean-Damien; Micheau, Philippe; Walti, Hervé; Nadeau, Mathieu; Robert, Raymond; Richard, Vincent; Mulder, Paul; Maresca, David; Demené, Charlie; Pernot, Mathieu; Tanter, Mickael; Ghaleh, Bijan; Berdeaux, Alain; Tissier, Renaud",Critical care medicine,10,9

Existing theories of virulence evolution based on a tradeoff between high transmission rates and long infectious periods imply that epidemic growth conditions will select for higher virulence, possibly leading to a transient peak in virulence near the beginning of an epidemic. This transient selection could lead to high virulence in emerging pathogens. Using a simple model of the epidemiological and evolutionary dynamics of emerging pathogens, along with rough estimates of parameters for pathogens such as severe acute respiratory syndrome, West Nile virus and myxomatosis, we estimated the potential magnitude and timing of such transient virulence peaks. Pathogens that are moderately evolvable, highly transmissible, and highly virulent at equilibrium could briefly double their virulence during an epidemic; thus, epidemic-phase selection could contribute significantly to the virulence of emerging pathogens. In order to further assess the potential significance of this mechanism, we bring together data from the literature for the shapes of tradeoff curves for several pathogens (myxomatosis, HIV, and a parasite of Daphnia) and the level of genetic variation for virulence for one (myxomatosis). We discuss the need for better data on tradeoff curves and genetic variance in order to evaluate the plausibility of various scenarios of virulence evolution.","Bolker, Benjamin M; Nanda, Arjun; Shah, Dharmini","Journal of the Royal Society, Interface",10,17

Yet, an unbiased understanding of the cellular and molecular processes affected in the brains of COVID-19 patients is still missing. Here, we profile 65,309 single-nucleus transcriptomes from 30 frontal cortex and choroid plexus samples across 14 control (including 1 terminal influenza) and 8 COVID-19 patients. While a systematic analysis yields no molecular traces of SARS-CoV-2 in the brain, we observe broad cellular perturbations which predict that choroid plexus barrier cells sense and relay peripheral inflammation into the brain and show that peripheral T cells infiltrate the parenchyma. We discover COVID-19 disease-associated microglia and astrocyte subpopulations that share features with pathological cell states reported in human neurodegenerative disease4-6. Synaptic signaling of upper-layer excitatory neurons-evolutionarily expanded in humans7 and linked to cognitive function8-are preferentially affected in COVID-19.

The real case, documented here, did not use aerial imagery, but used ground-penetrating radar (calibrated to the test site described here) to identify two locations that were probed for gas release and the deployment of victim recovery dogs. We suggest technological advances in remotely sensed aerial imagery that have developed since 2004 will demonstrate their use in focusing such searches by informing a Geoforensic Search Strategy (GSS) and suggesting locations accessible by a perpetrator to identify a burial location using the still-existent analogue site. To test this, in the spring of 2020 a DJI Mavic Pro drone was flown over the control site containing the simulated 2004 burial. Aerial image processing included the creation of orthomosaics, Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Visual Atmospheric Resistance Index (VARI), and photogrammetry. Conventional ground-based geophysical surveys using ground-penetrating radar, guided by this new type of information integrated into the GSS, confirmed that anomalies seen in drone data were the 16-year-old burial. We test this strategy using both the original simulated burial in Northern Ireland and further evaluate it in two recent simulated graves in the United States in more complex scenarios, but with successful results.","Rocke, Benjamin; Ruffell, Alastair; Donnelly, Laurance",Journal of forensic sciences,10,1

Early studies showed favorable short-term results of endoscopic transanal proctectomy (ETAP), with low conversion rates to open procedures. We aimed to compare efficacy, morbidity, and functional outcomes of ETAP to standard LAP for low rectal cancer. STUDY DESIGN From 2008 to 2013, 72 consecutive patients received proctectomy and coloanal manual anastomosis for low rectal adenocarcinoma. Thirty-four patients had transanal endoscopic proctectomy, and 38 patients underwent the standard laparoscopic procedure. RESULTS When compared with the LAP group, the ETAP group demonstrated a lower conversion rate to open procedures (23.7% vs 2.9%, respectively; p = 0.015), shorter in-hospital stays (9 vs 8 days, respectively; p = 0.04), and a lower readmission rate (13.2% vs 0%; p = 0.03). Overall postoperative morbidity rates for the LAP and the ETAP groups (36.8% vs 32.4%, respectively; p = 0.69) and functional results (Kirwan score 1/2, 73.7% vs 73.5%, respectively; p = 0.85) were comparable; additionally, we found similar oncologic quality criteria (R1 resection 10.5% vs 5.9%, respectively; p = 0.68; grade 3 mesorectal integrity 52.6% vs 55.9%, respectively; p = 0.66). Disease-free survival of 24 months (Kaplan-Meier estimation) was comparable in the 2 groups: 86% in the ETAP group vs 88% in the LAP group; p = 0.91. At the date of last follow-up, 91.2% of ETAP patients and 92.1% of LAP patients were free of stoma. CONCLUSIONS The endoscopic transanal approach could facilitate mesorectal excision and improve short-term outcomes without impairing the oncologic quality of the resection or mid-term functional and oncologic results.","Lelong, Bernard; Meillat, Hélène; Zemmour, Christophe; Poizat, Flora; Ewald, Jacques; Mege, Diane; Lelong, Jean-Claude; Delpero, Jean Robert; de Chaisemartin, Cécile",Journal of the American College of Surgeons,10,1

We herein report an easy and low-cost thoracic trocar technique (TTT) for these types of procedures and recommend the simpler name ""transumbilical scarless surgery"" (TUSS) to minimize confusion in nomenclature. METHODS We retrospectively reviewed patients who underwent TUSS by TTT using a thoracic trocar and surgical glove in our hospital between November 2011 and November 2012. Operating time, postoperative stay, and complications were detailed. RESULTS A total of 101 TUSS by TTT were successfully performed, comprising appendectomy (n = 63), ovarian cyst excision (n = 7), splenectomy (n = 5), nephroureterectomy (n = 5), orchidopexy (n = 4), pyeloplasty (n = 3), nephrolithotomy (n = 2), orchiectomy (n = 2), varicocelectomy (n = 2), lymphangioma excision (n = 2), ureterectomy (n = 1), Morgagni diaphragmatic hernia repair (n = 1), ovarian detorsion (n = 1), antegrade continence enema (n = 1), intestinal resection anastomosis (n = 1), and intestinal duplication excision (n = 1). Kirschner wires were used for some organ traction. Nine patients required an additional port, but no major complications occurred. The postoperative stay (mean ± standard deviation) was 3.2 ± 1.4 days, and operating time was 58.9 ± 38.3 minutes. CONCLUSION We recommend the simpler name of TUSS to minimize confusion in nomenclature for all transumbilical single-incision laparoendoscopic surgeries. TTT is an easy and low-cost TUSS technique.","Uygun, Ibrahim; Okur, Mehmet Hanifi; Aydogdu, Bahattin; Arslan, Mehmet Serif; Cimen, Hasan; Otcu, Selcuk",Journal of the Korean Surgical Society,10,30

In order to define the epidemiological, clinical and diagnostic features of these infections, a prospective study was conducting from September 2018 to May 2019, at the University Hospital of Tizi-Ouzou (Algeria). PATIENTS All patients addressed to the Laboratory of Parasitology-Mycology of the University Hospital of Tizi-Ouzou for a suspected Tinea capitis, were included in this study. MATERIALS AND METHODS Before sampling, contact with animals or soil, presence of similar lesions in the family circle, and previous antifungal or corticosteroid treatment were searched. Mycological examination included direct microscopic examination of the samples, and culture on Sabouraud agar slants at 27°C for up to 4weeks. RESULTS Out of the 87 samples examined, 46 allowed us to confirm the diagnosis of Tinea capitis, representing a positivity rate of 52.9%. The sex ratio was 1.09 (52.2% males vs. 47.8% females among the infected patients), and the infection mainly involved children of 4-6years (43.3%). Thirty-four strains of dermatophytes were isolated. Microsporum canis was the most frequent species identified (44.1%), followed by Trichophyton mentagrophytes (38.2%). During this study, Trichophyton tonsurans, an unusual dermatophyte species in Algeria, was identified for the first time in our hospital. CONCLUSION Tinea capitis are still common in Algeria, mainly affecting school-aged children and preschool children. Microsporum canis and T. mentagrophytes are the major causative agents, in agreement with previous studies showing a decrease in frequency of anthropophilic species, in favour of zoophilic species.","Kheffache, H; Seklaoui, N; Bouchara, J P; Boukhemza-Zemmouri, N; Boukhemza, M",Journal de mycologie medicale,10,7

However, no studies have compared the effects of newly marketed video laryngoscopes and the Macintosh laryngoscope (Mac) on teeth. In this study, we measured and compared the force exerted on the teeth of an intubating manikin by the Mac, the Airway Scope (Pentax), and the McGrath MAC (Covidien). The mean force exerted was 141.1 ± 15.7 kg by the Mac, 39.2 ± 10.3 kg by the Airway Scope, and 48.7 ± 6.7 kg by the McGrath MAC. No significant difference was observed between the Airway Scope and the McGrath MAC. When the Mac is inserted, the glottis has to be visually located from outside the oral cavity. However, a significant force is not necessary when inserting video laryngoscopes because a camera is mounted on the blade tip. In this laboratory model, the lower force exerted by the video laryngoscopes should contribute to a reduction in their impact on fracture or dislocation of teeth.","Kato, Yasuhiko; Sakuma, Yasushi; Momota, Yoshihiro",Anesthesia progress,10,31

The objective of this overview of systematic reviews (SR) was to update evidence and assess the effects of various approaches for teaching evidence-based health care (EBHC) at undergraduate (UG) and postgraduate (PG) medical education (ME) level on changes in knowledge, skills, attitudes and behaviour. METHODS AND FINDINGS This is an update of an overview that was published in 2014. The process followed standard procedures specified for the previous version of the overview, with a modified search. Searches were conducted in Epistemonikos for SRs published from 1 January 2013 to 27 October 2020 with no language restrictions. We checked additional sources for ongoing and unpublished SRs. Eligibility criteria included: SRs which evaluated educational interventions for teaching EBHC compared to no intervention or a different strategy were eligible. Two reviewers independently selected SRs, extracted data and evaluated quality using standardised instrument (AMSTAR2). The effects of strategies to teach EBHC were synthesized using a narrative approach. Previously published version of this overview included 16 SR, while the updated search identified six additional SRs. We therefore included a total of 22 SRs (with a total of 141 primary studies) in this updated overview. The SRs evaluated different educational interventions of varying duration, frequency, and format to teach various components of EBHC at different levels of ME (UG, PG, mixed). Most SRs assessed a range of EBHC related outcomes using a variety of assessment tools. Two SRs included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) only, while 20 reviews included RCTs and various types of non-RCTs. Diversity of study designs and teaching activities as well as aggregated findings at the SR level prevented comparisons of the effects of different techniques. In general, knowledge was improved across all ME levels for interventions compared to no intervention or pre-test scores. Skills improved in UGs, but less so in PGs and were less consistent in mixed populations. There were positive changes in behaviour among UGs and PGs, but not in mixed populations, with no consistent improvement in attitudes in any of the studied groups. One SR showed improved patient outcomes (based on non-randomised studies). Main limitations included: poor quality and reporting of SRs, heterogeneity of interventions and outcome measures, and short-term follow up. CONCLUSIONS Teaching EBHC consistently improved EBHC knowledge and skills at all levels of ME and behaviour in UGs and PGs, but with no consistent improvement in attitudes towards EBHC, and little evidence of the long term influence on processes of care and patient outcomes. EBHC teaching and learning should be interactive, multifaceted, integrated into clinical practice, and should include assessments.

It usually arises from the cervical area which is susceptible to Human Papilloma virus induced malignancy changes. In low-resource setting visual inspection with acetic acid (VIA) is an alternative sensitive cervical screening method. Therefore the aim of this study was to assess the magnitude and associated factors of VIA positive test results for Cervical Cancer screening among Eritrean refugee women aged 25-49 years in northern Ethiopia refugee camps. METHODS A community based cross-sectional study was conducted among 412 Eritrean refugee women aged 25-49 years from august 10 to September 25, 2018. Study subjects were selected by simple random sampling method. Data were collected using pretested structured questioner through Face-to-face interview and cervical examination. Data were coded and entered to Epi info software version 7 and then exported to Statistical package for Social Science (SPSS) version 21 for analysis. Bivariable and multivariable logistic regression analysis was made to test the association between the independent variables and the outcome variable. P-value of less than 0.05 with 95% CI was considered to declare statistical significance. RESULT In this study the magnitude of VIA positive precancerous cervical lesions was 9% (95% CI: 6.3-11.8%). Previous history of sexually transmitted infections (STI) [AOR (95%CI) = 2.84(1.07-7.53)] and presence of STI during cervical examination [AOR (95%CI) =3.97(1.75-9.00)] were found significantly associated with VIA positive precancerous cervical lesions. CONCLUSIONS In this study the magnitude of VIA positive precancerous cervical lesions was high. Previous history of sexually transmitted infections (STI) and presence of STI during cervical examination were found associated with VIA positive precancerous cervical lesions. Efforts such as early screening for sexually transmitted disease shall be done to prevent precancerous cervical lesions.","Hailemariam, Gebretsadik; Gebreyesus, Hailay; Wubayehu, Tewolde; Gebregyorgis, Tsgehana; Gebrecherkos, Kidanemariam; Teweldemedhin, Mebrahtu; Kifle, Manaye",BMC cancer,10,31

The aim of this study is to compare absorbable and nonabsorbable suture materials which had been used for closing the transcolumellar incision, in the aspect of risk of postoperative infection, wound healing, postoperative columellar scar and patient satisfaction. METHOD A prospective, randomized, single-blind study was conducted between May 2017 and February 2018. Sixty-four rhinoplasty patients were randomly assigned to absorbable (n = 32) or nonabsorbable (n = 32) groups. The columellar incision was closed with 7 full-thickness skin sutures. Either nonabsorbable 6/0 polypropylene (Group 1) or absorbable 6/0 polyglytone 6211 (Group 2) sutures were placed at the columellar incisions. Polypropylene sutures were removed at the 7th postoperative day. A Mann-Whitney U test and Monte Carlo were used for statistical comparison. Photographs of the patients at the postoperative third month (Fig. 2) were evaluated and scored in terms of scarring, pigmentation, notching, level differences in the incision area by two different otorhinolaryngologists who did not know the randomization. Suture removing discomfort was assessed with visual analogue scale scores. A satisfaction survey was filled out by all the patients completing their third month after the operation. RESULTS According to the results of both otorhinolaryngologists, there was no significant difference between the two groups in terms of pigmentation, level difference, notching, overall appearance and total score (p = 0.920, p = 0.498, respectively). The mean score on the Wong-Baker scale was 3.19 ± 1.67 in group 1. In the Satisfaction Survey, the average score of the group 1 was 6.90 ± 3.24, while the mean score of the group 2 was 7.062 ± 2.77. There was no statistically significant difference between the two groups (p = 0.715). CONCLUSIONS Suturing inverted V transcolumellar incisions with rapid resorbable sutures caused significantly less discomfort but no difference in scarring compared to nonresorbable sutures as evaluated by patients and observers.

Most pathogens invade via a mucosal pathway (oral, intranasal, or vaginal). It is widely accepted that Lactobacillus species play a critical role as commensals in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. Their ability to survive in the digestive tract, their close association with the intestinal epithelium, their immunomodulatory properties and their safety even when consumed in large amounts make lactobacilli attractive candidates for live vehicles for the delivery of immunogens to the intestinal mucosa. The oral or intranasal administration of Lactobacillus-based vaccines is a promising method to control mucosal infection because these vaccines could induce strong humoral and cellular immune responses both in the blood and at mucosal sites.","Yu, Qinghua; Zhu, Liqi; Kang, Haihong; Yang, Qian",Human vaccines & immunotherapeutics,10,1

Patients that underwent a review after a telephone triage had a greater requirement for manipulation (49.7% compared to 29.6% in the control group). The telephone triage strategy led to a two-fold improvement in utilisation of outpatient capacity in the National Health Service by reducing the need for face-to-face appointments, and by decreasing patients' non-attendance to their appointments. Although in place prior to the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, the telephone triage service was particularly useful as an alternative way of working to reduce the need for face-to-face interaction.

Our main objective was to assess the impact of PCR results and patient's severity on single room assignment. METHODS All patients admitted to Bichat-Claude Bernard Hospital through the ED and tested for influenza by PCR (GenXpert, Cepheid) or (FilmArray, BioMérieux) on a nasopharyngeal swab were retrospectively included during three influenza seasons (2015-2018. RESULTS Of 1,330 included patients, 278 (20.9%) had a positive PCR for influenza. The median time to obtain a PCR result was 19 hours, and 238 (18.3%) patients were assigned a single room. Among patients with positive and negative influenza PCR, 22.3% and 16.7% were assigned a single room (p = 0.03). The multivariable analysis was performed on the two first epidemic periods, excluding the third epidemic because of the concomitant use of influenza immune-chromatic test. Only level 1 of the Emergency severity index (ESI) (aOR, 1.9; 95% CI, 1.3-2.8; p < 0.01) was associated with single-room assignment. PCR result was not statistically associated with the decision of single room assignment (aOR, 1.4; 95%CI, 1.0-1.4; p = 0.07). CONCLUSION A PCR positive for influenza was not significantly associated with single-room assignment. Less than one quarter of influenza patients were adequately assigned a single room, likely due to the long turnaround time of PCR result and other conflicting indications for single room-assignment. Accelerating biological diagnosis could improve single-room assignment.","Bouzid, Donia; Visseaux, Benoit; Perozziello, Anne; Lescure, Xavier; Duval, Xavier; Casalino, Enrique; Lucet, Jean Christophe",PloS one,10,5

Single-incision laparoscopic surgery (SILS) is a new laparoscopic procedure. Herein we would like to present our experiences. PATIENTS AND METHODS Between January 2009 and October 2009, data of the 32 patients who were operated through SILS are evaluated prospectively. There were 22 females and 10 males with a mean age of 45.1±14.8 years. Ten splenectomies for idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, 16 cholecystectomies for acute cholecystitis or asymptomatic gallstones, 3 appendectomies for acute appendicitis, one distal pancreatosplenectomy for Renal Cell Cancer metastases, 1 adrenalectomy for Conn Syndrome and 1 case of liver resection for hepatic adenoma were carried out. The most common splenectomy indication was idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, cholecystectomy indication was acute cholecystitis (n=8), and asymptomatic cholelithiasis (n=8), appendectomy indication was acute appendicitis, distal pancreatosplenectomy indication was renal cell cancer metastases, adrenalectomy indication was Conn syndrome and liver resection indication was left hepatic mass in between segments 1 and 2. SILS was carried out successfully in 31 patients. Only in 1 patient conversion was required owing to bleeding. RESULTS All procedures were carried out through a 2-cm umbilical incision. There was no mortality and morbidity recorded. CONCLUSIONS In experienced hands of minimally invasive surgeons, SILS incision laparoscopic surgery could be carried out successfully in a wide range of surgical operations. However, to be able to show the differences between Standard laparoscopic surgery and single SILS, prospective randomized comparative studies are required.","Barbaros, Umut; Sümer, Aziz; Tunca, Fatih; Gözkün, Osman; Demirel, Tuğrul; Bilge, Orhan; Randazzo, Valentina; Dinççağ, Ahmet; Seven, Ridvan; Mercan, Selçuk; Budak, Demir","Surgical laparoscopy, endoscopy & percutaneous techniques",10,1

Current occupational health (OH) management of WRSAD is based on clinical and managerial guidelines and individual risk assessment. AIMS The study sought to identify patterns of OH advice in WRSAD and the relationships between the OH advice, available evidence, experience and expertise of the OH doctors (OHDs). METHODS A retrospective cross-sectional analysis of 101 first-time OH consultations for WRSAD by nine OHDs. RESULTS The three most common OH interventions included follow-up OH consultations, adjusted duties and referrals for counselling. All OHDs preferred a light-touch approach but the less experienced and qualified OHDs were more proactive and prescriptive. CONCLUSIONS In the absence of a specific occupational medical guideline for the management of WRSAD, the OH interventions may be guided by clinical guidelines, individual risk assessment, the client's circumstances or the experience, expertise and preferences of the OHDs.

The etiology includes infectious agents (mostly viruses), systemic diseases and toxins. We aim to characterize infants and children with myocarditis at post-mortem presenting as sudden deaths. METHODS Retrospective evaluation of 813 post-mortems in infants and children dying suddenly and unexpectedly between 2009-2019. Data retrieved included histological features, microbiology and clinical history. RESULTS 23 of 813 post-mortems reviewed corresponded to acute myocarditis and 1 to dilated cardiomyopathy related to remote Parvovirus infection. PCR identified enterovirus (7), parvovirus (7 cases, 2 also with HHV6 and 1 case with EVB), Influenza A (1), Parainfluenza type 3 (1). Two cases corresponded to hypersensitivity myocarditis, 1 was Group A Streptococcus and 5 idiopathic myocarditis. Enterovirus was frequent in infants (7/10), and in newborns was associated with meningoencephalitis or congenital myocarditis. More than 50% were less than 2 years of age and all remained clinically unsuspected. CONCLUSION Myocarditis represents almost 3% of all sudden pediatric deaths. Enterovirus and parvovirus were the most common viruses. This retrospective analysis showed that patients experienced viral symptoms but remained unsuspected, highlighting the need for more clinical awareness of myocarditis.","Neagu, Oana; Rodríguez, Amparo Fernández; Callon, Domitille; Andréoletti, Laurent; Cohen, Marta C",Pediatric and developmental pathology : the official journal of the Society for Pediatric Pathology and the Paediatric Pathology Society,10,1

All members of the scientific community should feel supported and free to contribute their best at such events. I evaluated the actions and policies of conferences held by international academic societies for ecology and conservation since 2009, to assess whether conferences support participation across sexual orientations and gender identities. Although half of the 30 conferences had codes of conduct promoting equity, diversity and inclusion, the quantity and quality of initiatives to support such principles varied between societies and years. Conferences with codes were significantly more likely to implement structural initiatives to minimize discrimination or harassment, such as procedures for reporting misconduct and submission guidelines to promote speaker diversity, as well as initiatives to support parents. Initiatives minimizing barriers to attendance were rare; 47% of conferences were held in locations that discriminate against certain identities and <10% promoted event safety and accessibility to potential attendees. Piecemeal actions and inadequate conference evaluation have resulted in no significant growth in gender equity or diversity initiatives. I propose a six-step timeline that improves conference inclusion by embedding diversity and equity into planning, financing, marketing, scientific and social scheduling, evaluation and reporting.","Tulloch, Ayesha I T",Nature ecology & evolution,10,19

Recently, the conventional bulk-boundary correspondence of band topology has been extended to higher-order cases that enable explorations of topological states with codimensions larger than one such as hinge and corner states. Here, we demonstrate a higher-order quantum spin Hall effect in a two-dimensional photonic crystal. Owing to the non-trivial higher-order topology and the pseudospin-pseudospin coupling, we observe a directional localization of photons at corners with opposite pseudospin polarizations through pseudospin-momentum-locked edge waves, resembling the quantum spin Hall effect in a higher-order manner. Our work inspires an unprecedented route to transport and trap spinful waves, supporting potential applications in topological photonic devices such as spinful topological lasers and chiral quantum emitters.","Xie, Biye; Su, Guangxu; Wang, Hong-Fei; Liu, Feng; Hu, Lumang; Yu, Si-Yuan; Zhan, Peng; Lu, Ming-Hui; Wang, Zhenlin; Chen, Yan-Feng",Nature communications,10,31

A single European centre experience.,11.52392,5.2596893,2015,"BACKGROUND Skin laxity is one of the defining characteristics of aging and can be the result of various factors including intrinsic aging, genetics, diet, stress, lifestyle, sun exposure, weight fluctuations, and smoking. Recent reports suggest the ability of subdermal energy application to reduce skin laxity. Thermal energy can be delivered using different devices including lasers, radiofrequency (RF) monopolar and bipolar devices, and plasma/RF devices. Plasma-based energy platforms generate a plasma gas, allowing heat to be applied to the tissue. This study focused on the evaluation of thermal effect of plasma/RF compared to a monopolar RF device applied percutaneously to the subdermis and connective fibroseptal network in a porcine model. METHODS The subdermal application of energy was conducted using a plasma/RF system and a monopolar RF system. Both low and high energy/temperature settings were evaluated in dynamic and stationary modes. Histomorphometry was used to determine the depth of thermal effect associated with each treatment setting. RESULTS Both dermis and fibroseptal network tissue exhibited the presence of microscopically thermally treated zones. There were no significant differences in average and maximum depths of thermal effect between the different handpieces and electrosurgical systems used for all treatment settings. CONCLUSIONS No significant differences in the thermal effect between plasma/RF and monopolar RF systems were observed, suggesting that plasma/RF systems can be safely used for the percutaneous application of energy in the subcutaneous space.","Ruff, Paul G",Journal of cosmetic dermatology,10,7

CD4+CD28null (CD28null) T cells are a specialised T lymphocyte subset that produce inflammatory cytokines and cytotoxic molecules. CD28null T cells expand preferentially in patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) rather than stable angina and are barely detectable in healthy subjects. Importantly, ACS patients with CD28null T cell expansion have increased risk for recurrent acute coronary events and poor prognosis, compared to ACS patients in whom this cell subset does not expand. The mechanisms regulating CD28null T cell expansion in ACS remain elusive. We therefore investigated the role of cytokines in CD28null T cell expansion in ACS. METHODS AND RESULTS High-purity sorted CD4+ T cells from ACS patients were treated with a panel of cytokines (TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-7, IL-15), and effects on the number, phenotype and function of CD28null T cells were analysed and compared to the control counterpart CD28+ T cell subset. IL-7 and IL-15 induced expansion of CD28null T cells from ACS patients, while inflammatory cytokines TNF-α, IL-1β and IL-6 did not. The mechanisms underlying CD28null T cell expansion by IL-7/IL-15 were preferential activation and proliferation of CD28null T cells compared to control CD28+ T cells. Additionally, IL-7/IL-15 markedly augmented CD28null T cell cytotoxic function and interferon-γ production. Further mechanistic analyses revealed differences in baseline expression of component chains of IL-7/IL-15 receptors (CD127 and CD122) and increased baseline STAT5 phosphorylation in CD28null T cells from ACS patients compared to the control CD28+ T cell subset. Notably, we demonstrate that CD28null T cell expansion was significantly inhibited by Tofacitinib, a selective JAK1/JAK3 inhibitor that blocks IL-7/IL-15 signalling. CONCLUSIONS Our novel data show that IL-7 and IL-15 drive the expansion and function of CD28null T cells from ACS patients suggesting that IL-7/IL-15 blockade may prevent expansion of these cells and improve patient outcomes. TRANSLATIONAL PERSPECTIVE CD28null T cells expansion in ACS patients is an independent predictor of future acute coronary events and poor prognosis. The precise mechanisms underlying CD28null T cell expansion in ACS remain elusive. We show that IL-7 and IL-15 cytokines cause expansion of CD28null T cells from ACS patients by triggering activation and proliferation, and augment the cytotoxic function of these cells and production of inflammatory cytokines. We demonstrate that CD28null T cell expansion is inhibited by Tofacitinib that specifically blocks IL-7/IL-15 signalling. Further dissection of the roles of IL-7/IL-15 may lead to more effective and specific anti-inflammatory therapies in ACS.","Bullenkamp, Jessica; Mengoni, Veronica; Kaur, Satdip; Chhetri, Ismita; Dimou, Paraskevi; Astroulakis, Zoë M J; Kaski, Juan Carlos; Dumitriu, Ingrid E",Cardiovascular research,10,17

However, the characteristics and prognosis of ICC is not well-known. This study aims to reveal the relationship between liver function and prognosis of ICC. METHODS A total of 83 ICC patients were recruited retrospectively from March 2009 to August 2020. Child-Pugh (CP) and albumin-bilirubin (ALBI) scores were used to assess liver function. The extent of portal vein tumor thrombosis (PVTT) was classified from Vp0 to Vp4. The endpoint for this analysis was overall survival (OS). RESULTS The median age was 72 (44-88) years old, 48 patients were male (57.8%), and 70 patients were classified as CP grade A (84.3%). At baseline, chronic liver disease (hepatitis B: 9.6%, hepatitis C: 15.7%, alcoholic liver disease: 9.6%, and non-alcoholic fatty liver: disease 4.8%) were diagnosed. The median OS of all ICC patients was 21.2 months. A total of 27 patients underwent surgical resection; these patients demonstrated a longer median OS compared to those who did not (50.8 months vs 5.5 months, P < 0.001). The prognosis of patients with ICC can be stratified by ALBI grade (grade 1: 54.3 months, grade 2a: 8.4 months, grade 2b: 3.9 months, and grade 3: 1.4 months; P < 0.001) and the extent of PVTT (Vp0: 54.3 months, Vp1/2: 8.4 months, Vp3/4: 3.9 months; P = 0.0039). CONCLUSION Viral hepatitis (25.3%) was found as the background liver disease of ICC. Assessing liver function via ALBI grade is useful for stratifying prognosis of patients with ICC.

The inhalation of traffic-related air pollution, including NO2, can cause a range of problems to human health. Due to their developing organs, children are particularly susceptible to the negative effects of air pollution inhalation. Accordingly, schools and associated travel behaviours present an important area of study for the reduction of child exposure to these harmful pollutants. COVID-19 reached the UK in late January 2020. On the 23rd of March that year, the UK government announced a nationwide stay-at-home order, or lockdown, banning all non-essential travel and contact with people outside of their own homes. The lockdown was accompanied by the closure of schools, public facilities, amenities, businesses and places of worship. The current study aims to assess the significance of nationwide NO2 reductions at schools in England as a consequence of the lockdown in order to highlight the benefits of associated behavioural changes within the context of schools in England and potential child exposure. NO2 data were collected from all AURN (Automatic Urban and Rural Network) monitoring sites within 500 m of nurseries, primary schools, secondary schools and colleges in England. A significant reduction of mean NO2 concentrations was observed in the first month of the UK lockdown at background (-35.13%) and traffic (-40.82%) sites. Whilst lockdown restrictions are undoubtedly unsustainable, the study results demonstrate the possible reductions of NO2 at schools in England and potential reductions of child exposure that are achievable when public behaviours shift towards active travel, work from home policies and generally lower use of polluting vehicles.","Brown, Louis; Barnes, Jo; Hayes, Enda",The Science of the total environment,10,26

Methods: The general conditions, biochemical indicators of liver, blood clotting mechanism, routine blood test, UGT1A1 * 28 gene polymorphism and other data of 40 cases with COVID-19 admitted to the isolation ward of Tangdu Hospital were retrospectively analyzed. The clinical characteristics, influencing factors and prognosis of liver injury in patients with liver injury group and those with normal liver function group were compared. The mean of two samples in univariate analysis was compared by t-test and analysis of variance. The counting data was measured by χ(2) tests. The non-normal distribution measurement data were described by the median, and the non-parametric test was used. Statistically significant influencing factors were used as the independent variables in univariate analysis. Multiple logistic regression analysis was used to analyze the main influencing factors of liver injury. Results: Of the 40 cases, 25 were male (62.5%) and 15 were female (37.5%), aged 22 to 83 (53.87 ± 15.84) years. Liver injury was occurred in 22 cases (55%) during the course of the disease. Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) level was initially increased (4.4 to 3.5 times of the normal value) along with decrease of albumin in the second week, and the difference was statistically significant (P < 0.001). Ten cases (43.5%) had highest abnormal total blood bilirubin (54.1 μmol/ L). There was no correlation between the increase in transaminase and the increase in total blood bilirubin (R = -0.006, P = 0.972). Three cases had prothrombin activity (PTA) of ≤ 50%, 10 cases had elevated FDP, and 13 cases had elevated D-dimer, all of whom were severe or critically ill. Liver function injury was more likely to occur in patients who used many types of drugs and large amounts of hormones (P = 0.002, P = 0.031), and there was no correlation with the TA6TA7 mutation in the UGT1A1 * 28 gene locus. Multiple regression analysis showed that the occurrence of liver injury was only related to critical illness. The liver function of all patients had recovered within one week after conventional liver protection treatment. Conclusion: COVID-19 combined with liver function injury may be due to the slight elevation of transaminase, mostly around the second week of the disease course. Severe patients have a higher proportion of liver injury, and critical type is an independent risk factor for liver injury.","Yao, N; Wang, S N; Lian, J Q; Sun, Y T; Zhang, G F; Kang, W Z; Kang, W",Zhonghua gan zang bing za zhi = Zhonghua ganzangbing zazhi = Chinese journal of hepatology,10,1

Polypharmacy increases the probability of drug-drug interactions (DDIs). Amongst these, DDIs involving clopidogrel, the most commonly utilized platelet P2Y12 inhibitor, is a topic of potential clinical concern. AREAS COVERED This article reviews DDIs between clopidogrel and drugs which are widely used in clinical practice. In particular, drugs shown to interfere with the pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic effects of clopidogrel and the clinical implications of these findings are reviewed. These drugs include inhibitors of gastric acid secretion, statins, calcium channel blockers, antidiabetic agents and antimicrobial agents. For the references, we searched PubMed, EMBASE, or the Cochrane Library. EXPERT OPINION Clopidogrel-drug interactions are common. Most of these DDIs are limited to laboratory findings showing an impact on clopidogrel-induced antiplatelet effects. While variability in clopidogrel-induced antiplatelet effects are known to affect clinical outcomes, with high platelet reactivity being associated with thrombotic complications among patients undergoing coronary stenting, most studies assessing the clinical implications of clopidogrel-drug interactions have not shown to significantly affect outcomes. However, awareness of these DDIs remain important for optimizing the selection of concomitant therapies.","Lee, Chang Hoon; Franchi, Francesco; Angiolillo, Dominick J",Expert opinion on drug metabolism & toxicology,10,1

The embolectomy tool of choice was the Amplatz GooseNeck snare (83%). Successful recanalization (modified TICI 2b +3) was seen in 74% of cases. A mRS ≤ 2 at 90 days was seen in 42% with a mortality rate of 17% and symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage in 4%. CONCLUSIONS A high recanalization rate was obtained with the Amplatz GooseNeck snare without any device-related complications. Favorable outcome, mortality, and symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage are comparable with results of newer embolectomy devices.","Rentzos, A; Lundqvist, C; Karlsson, J-E; Vilmarsson, V; Schnabel, K; Wikholm, G",AJNR.

Liver fibrosis is an important prognostic factor in NAFLD, and detection is vital. The pathophysiological changes of obesity can alter the accuracy of non-invasive NAFLD tests. We aimed to review current evidence for common non-invasive tests for NAFLD-related fibrosis in obesity. METHODS We systematically searched for studies assessing the diagnostic accuracy of 11 biomarker panels and elastography techniques for NAFLD-related fibrosis in obesity. Meta-analyses were performed where possible. RESULTS Thirty-eight studies were identified assessing the selected tests in obese populations. Simple biomarker panels (e.g. NAFLD fibrosis score) were the most validated. Evidence showed better accuracy of complex biomarker panels (NAFLD fibrosis score: summary receiver operator characteristic [SROC] 0.795-0.813 vs. enhanced liver fibrosis: SROC 0.962); however, these were poorly validated in obesity. Elastography techniques were better studied and had high diagnostic accuracy (transient elastography: SROC 0.859; magnetic resonance elastography: SROC 0.965) but were limited by BMI-dependent failure. Limited evidence was found to validate the accuracy of any test in exclusively obese populations. CONCLUSION In obese subjects, complex biomarker panels and elastography have been reasonable to good accuracy for NAFLD-related fibrosis; however, these methods have not been well validated. Further study in this high-risk population is needed.","Ooi, G J; Mgaieth, S; Eslick, G D; Burton, P R; Kemp, W W; Roberts, S K; Brown, W A",Obesity reviews : an official journal of the International Association for the Study of Obesity,10,16

Mass fractions of metals, including Ag, Cd, and Pb, and of one metalloid, Sb, higher than their crustal abundance, were observed within the entire Weser Basin. Isotope-amount ratio n(87Sr)/n(86Sr) and εNd ranged from 0.71182 ± 0.00005 to 0.72880 ± 0.00009 and -11.3 ± 0.3 to -21.0 ± 0.3, respectively. n(206Pb)/n(204Pb), n(207Pb)/n(204Pb), and n(208Pb)/n(204Pb) ranged from 18.226 ± 0.008 to 18.703 ± 0.012, 15.613 ± 0.007 to 15.653 ± 0.012 and 38.14 ± 0.02 to 38.84 ± 0.02, respectively. Sr and Nd isotope compositions reflected primarily a mixture of natural materials derived from the Weser Basin. Pb isotope signatures indicated strong anthropogenic influences in the middle-lower Weser region. Pb isotopic compositions in the sediments from the Aller (tributary of the Weser) and its tributary suggested influence from historical Pb-Zn ore mining in the Harz Mountains that might contribute to the observed elevated mass fractions of Ag, Cd, Sb and Pb in that region. K-means cluster and principal component analysis of the Sr, Nd, and Pb isotope data yielded results consistent with their isotope systematics, supporting statistical analysis as an unsupervised tool in isotope fingerprinting studies. Sr, Nd, and Pb isotopic signatures in the sediments of the Weser were distinctively different from those of another major river discharging into the North Sea, the Elbe. This suggested that this Sr, Nd, and Pb isotope dataset can be used to distinguish riverine input of sediment materials and metals between the two rivers, thereby assessing their individual contribution to materials transported into the North Sea.","Deng, Feifei; Hellmann, Steffen; Zimmermann, Tristan; Pröfrock, Daniel",The Science of the total environment,10,0

METHODS This was a multi-centre retrospective study of patients who had undergone either sacral neuromodulation (SNM) or delayed sphincter repair or sphincteroplasty (SR) as primary surgical intervention for FI in five centres in Europe and one in USA. Flow of patients according to the intervention, sustainability of the treatment at minimum5-year follow-up, complications and requirement for further interventions were recorded. RESULTS 461 patients (median age 56, range 24-90, 41 male) had either SNM or SR as an index operation during the study period (SNM: 284 (61.6%), SR:177 (38.4%)).Among SNM patients, there were 169 revisional operations (change of battery and/or lead, resiting or removal). 203 patients (71.4%) continue to use SNM at the time of last follow-up. Among SR patients, 30 (16.9%) had complications, most notably wound infection (22, 12.4%). 32 patients (18.1%) crossed over to SNM during follow-up. Comparing two 4-year periods (2000-2003 and 2007-2010), the proportion of patients operated who had a circumferential sphincter defect of less than 90 degrees was 48 (68%) and 45 (46%), respectively (p=0.03) while those who had SNM as primary intervention increased from 29% to 89% (p<0.05).

Effect of supervisory load, years of Australian registration and departmental flow factors were evaluated. Descriptive statistical methods were used and regression analyses were performed.ResultsA total of 188 shifts were analysed. Productivity was 4.07 patients per 9.5-h shift (95% CI 3.56-4.58) or 0.43 patients per h, representing a 48.5% reduction from previously published data (P<0.0001). Working in a shift outside of the resuscitation area or working a day shift was associated with a reduction in individual patient load. There was a 2.2% (95% CI: 1.1-3.4, P<0.001) decrease in productivity with each year after obtaining Australian medical registration. There was a 10.6% (95% CI: 5.4-15.6, P<0.001) decrease in productivity for each junior physician supervised. Bed access had no statistically significant effect on productivity.ConclusionsEmergency physicians undertake multiple duties. Their ability to manage their own patients varies depending on multiple ED operational factors, particularly their supervisory load. COVID-19 preparations reduced their ability to see their own patients by half.What is known about the topic?An understanding of emergency physician productivity is essential in planning clinical operations. Medical productivity, however, is challenging to define, and is controversial to measure. Although baseline data exist, few studies examine the effect of patient flow and supervision requirements on the emergency physician's ability to perform primary consults. No studies describe these metrics during COVID-19.What does this paper add?This pilot study provides a novel cross-sectional description of the effect of COVID-19 preparations on the ability of emergency physicians to provide direct patient care. It also examines the effect of selected system and process factors in a physician's ability to complete primary consults.What are the implications for practitioners?When managing an emergency medical workforce, the contribution of emergency physicians to the number of patients requiring consults should take into account the high volume of alternative duties required. Increasing alternative duties can decrease primary provider tasks that can be completed. COVID-19 pandemic preparation has significantly reduced the ability of emergency physicians to manage their own patients.","Lim, Andy; Gupta, Namankit; Lim, Alvin; Hong, Wei; Walker, Katie",Australian health review : a publication of the Australian Hospital Association,10,16

RECENT FINDINGS Given significant overlap in symptoms, care must be taken to differentiate routine allergic conditions from COVID-19 infection but it appears that most allergic diseases are not risk factors for a severe COVID-19 course. The full impact of restricted allergy/immunology ambulatory services will take months to years to fully understand. One benefit of having to adapt practice style is greater awareness and acceptance of shared decision-making and recognition of preference-sensitive care options in food allergy, in particular for approaches towards allergy prevention, treatment, and anaphylaxis care. Social distancing and masks have helped reduce spread of common respiratory viruses, which may be helping to lower the incidence of viral-associated wheezing episodes, enhancing evidence of the effects of preventing exposure of young children to respiratory viruses on asthma pathogenesis, as well as on allergic rhinitis. There has been a revolution in the rise of telemedicine to increase access to high-quality allergy/immunology specialty care.

Genetic data have been generated from virus populations since the late 1970s and used to understand their evolution, emergence, and spread, culminating in the generation and analysis of many thousands of viral genome sequences. Despite this wealth of data, evolutionary genetics has played a surprisingly small role in our understanding of virus evolution. Instead, studies of RNA virus evolution have been dominated by two very different perspectives, the experimental and the comparative, that have largely been conducted independently and sometimes antagonistically. Here, we review the insights that these two approaches have provided over the last 40 years. We show that experimental approaches using in vitro and in vivo laboratory models are largely focused on short-term intrahost evolutionary mechanisms, and may not always be relevant to natural systems. In contrast, the comparative approach relies on the phylogenetic analysis of natural virus populations, usually considering data collected over multiple cycles of virus-host transmission, but is divorced from the causative evolutionary processes. To truly understand RNA virus evolution it is necessary to meld experimental and comparative approaches within a single evolutionary genetic framework, and to link viral evolution at the intrahost scale with that which occurs over both epidemiological and geological timescales. We suggest that the impetus for this new synthesis may come from methodological advances in next-generation sequencing and metagenomics.","Geoghegan, Jemma L; Holmes, Edward C",Genetics,10,1

We describe a hybrid approach that combines video-assisted thoracic surgery (VATS) lobectomy and limited Shaw-Paulson thoracotomy. METHODS We report a case of Pancoast tumor in a 57-year-old man, staged as cT3N0M0, that was treated with induction chemoradiotherapy prior to the hybrid surgical approach. After thoracoscopic pleural cavity inspection, an upper right VATS lobectomy by a 3-port standard approach was performed. The chest wall was resected through a limited paravertebral incision, allowing the extraction of the lobe together with the rib segments. The posterior chest wall defect was repaired with a synthetic patch. RESULTS The postoperative period was uneventful and the pain never exceed a score of 3 on a visual analogue scale. Pathological examination revealed nonvital tumor cells in the specimen (ypT0N0M0). The patient is disease free at 6 months' follow-up.

Increasingly, computational design plays an important role in such efforts. Our coarse-grained RAG (RNA-As-Graphs) framework offers strategies for enumerating the universe of RNA 2D folds, selecting ""RNA-like"" candidates for design, and determining sequences that fold onto these candidates. In RAG, RNA secondary structures are represented as tree or dual graphs. Graphs with known RNA structures are called ""existing"", and the others are labeled ""hypothetical"". By using simplified features for RNA graphs, we have clustered the hypothetical graphs into ""RNA-like"" and ""non-RNA-like"" groups and proposed RNA-like graphs as candidates for design. Here, we propose a new way of designing graph features by using Fiedler vectors. The new features reflect graph shapes better, and they lead to a more clustered organization of existing graphs. We show significant increases in K-means clustering accuracy by using the new features (e.g., up to 95% and 98% accuracy for tree and dual graphs, respectively). In addition, we propose a scoring model for top graph candidate selection. This scoring model allows users to set a threshold for candidates, and it incorporates weighing of existing graphs based on their corresponding number of known RNAs.

This condition with poorly understood incidence and etiology is characterized by the locoregional development of scar tissue, leading to subcutaneous cording, motion impairment and pain. The early identification of patients at risk for AWS would improve their clinical management. Here, we sought to characterize the prevalence of and the risk factors associated with AWS in BC women after surgery. PATIENTS AND METHODS All patients with BC that underwent axillary surgery referred to an Outpatient Service for Oncological Rehabilitation were retrospectively collected. These women were assessed two weeks after the surgical procedure for their clinicopathologic features, type of therapeutic interventions, and AWS presence, laterality, pain, localization, cords type, and number of cords. RESULTS Altogether, 177 patients (mean aged 60.65 ± 12.26 years) were included and divided into two groups: AWSPOS (n=52; 29.4%) and AWSNEG (n=125; 70.6%). Patients with tumor N ≥1 (OR=3.7; p<0.001), subjected to mastectomy, axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) and chemotherapy showed significant correlations with AWS onset (p<0.05). The range of shoulder motion limitation (OR=11.2; p<0.001) and the presence of breast cancer related lymphedema (OR=3.5; p=0.020) were associated with AWS. CONCLUSIONS Mastectomy, ALND, chemotherapy, low staging tumors, shoulder range of motion limitations, and BCRL represent risk factors for AWS onset. Realizing new strategies for assessing the individual risk of AWS is a crucial clinical need to improve the health-related quality of life of BC survivors.","de Sire, A; Losco, L; Cisari, C; Gennari, A; Boldorini, R; Fusco, N; Cigna, E; Invernizzi, M",European review for medical and pharmacological sciences,10,33

METHODS We used human-centered design (HCD) to understand the challenges facing Medicaid-insured pregnant people and design interventions to address these challenges. The HCD method has three phases: Inspiration, Ideation, and Implementation. This study focused on the first and second. In the Inspiration phase we conducted semi-structured interviews with a purposeful sample of stakeholders who had either received or participated in the care of Medicaid-insured pregnant people within our community, with a specific emphasis on representation from marginalized communities. Using a general inductive approach to thematic analysis, we identified themes, which were then framed into design opportunities. In the Ideation phase, we conducted structured brainstorming sessions to generate potential prototypes of solutions, which were tested and iterated upon through a series of community events and engagement with a diverse community advisory group. RESULTS We engaged a total of 171 stakeholders across both phases of the HCD methodology. In the Inspiration phase, interviews with 23 community members and an eight-person focus group revealed seven insights centered around two main themes: (1) racism and discrimination create major barriers to access, experience, and the ability to deliver high-value pregnancy care; (2) pregnancy care is overmedicalized and does not treat the pregnant person as an equal and informed partner. In the Ideation phase, 162 ideas were produced and translated into eight solution prototypes. Community scoring and feedback events with 140 stakeholders led to the progressive refinement and selection of three final prototypes: (1) implementing telemedicine (video visits) within the safety-net system, (2) integrating community-based peer support workers into healthcare teams, and (3) delivering co-located pregnancy-related care and services into high-need neighborhoods as a one-stop shop. CONCLUSIONS Using HCD methodology and a collaborative community-health system approach, we identified gaps, opportunities, and solutions to address perinatal care inequities within our urban community. Given the urgent need for implementable and effective solutions, the design process was particularly well-suited because it focuses on understanding and centering the needs and values of stakeholders, is multi-disciplinary through all phases, and results in prototyping and iteration of real-world solutions.","Nijagal, Malini A; Patel, Devika; Lyles, Courtney; Liao, Jennifer; Chehab, Lara; Williams, Schyneida; Sammann, Amanda",BMC health services research,10,7

Clinical impact depends on many factors including the virus itself. One method to sub-type PRRSv is using restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP). The RFLP pattern 1-7-4 emerged within the United States swine industry in 2014 and has become prevalent since then. This was a field study that prospectively followed 1-7-4-infected breeding herds (n=107) and compared time to stability (TTS), time to baseline production (TTBP) and total loss per 1000 sows between herds using modified-live virus vaccine (MLV) on sows and gilts (MLV-MLV), MLV on sows and MLV in addition to field virus exposure on gilts (MLV-MLV/FVE) or not deliberately exposing sows or gilts to PRRSv (Natural-Natural). Analyses were done in SAS 9.4 and results were adjusted by selected co-variates (duration of herd closure, number of previous PRRSv outbreaks of last 3 years, weaning frequency/week, gilt development unit location, herd size and production system). Survival analysis was conducted on TTS and TTBP and regression analysis on total loss. Herds in the Natural-Natural group achieved TTS and TTBP before other herds. Herds in the MLV-MLV/FVE had the longest TTS and TTBP. The total loss was numerically least in MLV-MLV herds (1194 pigs/1000 sows) compared to MLV/MLV-FVE (1810/1000 sows) and Natural-Natural (2671/1000 sows). This study provided additional information to assist veterinarians deciding between methods of exposure to manage PRRSv infection from breeding herds.","Linhares, D C L; Betlach, C; Morrison, R B",Preventive veterinary medicine,10,31

The present study aimed to provide current antimicrobial resistance and epidemiological profiles of S. pneumoniae infections in Taiwan. METHODS A total of 252 nonduplicate S. pneumoniae isolates were collected from patients admitted to 16 hospitals in Taiwan between January 2017 and December 2019, and were analyzed. The minimum inhibitory concentration of antibiotics was determined using the Vitek 2 automated system for antimicrobial susceptibility testing. Furthermore, epidemiological profiles of S. pneumoniae infections were analyzed. RESULTS Among the strains analyzed, 88% were recognized as invasive pneumococcal strains. According to the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute criteria for non-meningitis, the prevalence of penicillin-non-susceptible S. pneumoniae demonstrated a declining trend from 43.6% in 2017 to 17.2% in 2019. However, the rate of penicillin-non-susceptible S. pneumoniae was 85.7% based on the criteria for meningitis. Furthermore, the prevalence of ceftriaxone-non-susceptible S. pneumoniae was 62.7% based on the criteria for meningitis. Isolates demonstrated higher susceptibility toward doripenem and ertapenem than toward meropenem and imipenem. An increased rate of non-susceptibility toward levofloxacin was observed in southern Taiwan (15.1%) and elderly patients (≥65 years; 11.4%). Most isolates were susceptible to vancomycin and linezolid. CONCLUSION Empirical treatment with ceftriaxone monotherapy for pneumococcal meningitis should be carefully monitored owing to its high non-susceptibility rate. The susceptibility rates of most isolates to penicillin (used for treating non-meningitis pneumococcal diseases), carbapenems (ertapenem and doripenem), respiratory quinolones (moxifloxacin and levofloxacin), vancomycin, and linezolid suggested the potential of these antibiotics in treating pneumococcal diseases in Taiwan.","Tsai, Yu-Te; Lee, Yu-Lin; Lu, Min-Chi; Shao, Pei-Lan; Lu, Po-Liang; Cheng, Shu-Hsing; Ko, Wen-Chien; Lin, Chi-Ying; Wu, Ting-Shu; Yen, Muh-Yong; Wang, Lih-Shinn; Liu, Chang-Pan; Lee, Wen-Sen; Shi, Zhi-Yuan; Chen, Yao-Shen; Wang, Fu-Der; Tseng, Shu-Hui; Lin, Chao-Nan; Chen, Yu-Hui; Sheng, Wang-Huei; Lee, Chun-Ming; Tang, Hung-Jen; Lin, Chun-Yu; Chen, Yen-Hsu; Hsueh, Po-Ren","Journal of microbiology, immunology, and infection = Wei mian yu gan ran za zhi",10,1

The aim of this study was to develop a new technique for transrectal specimen extraction (TRSE) and to compare it with conventional laparoscopy (CL) for left sided colectomy. METHOD Eleven patients with benign disease requiring either sigmoid or left colon resection underwent TRSE. The unfired circular stapler was inserted transanally and used as a guide to suture-close the recto-sigmoid junction laparoscopically and as a handle to pull the sutured sigmoid through the opened rectum inside a laparoscopic camera bag. The anvil was inserted into the lumen of the intussuscepted sigmoid and pushed to the level of the anastomosis. The anastomosis was fashioned end-to-end in the first patients and side-to-end in the following patients to improve safety. Intra-operative and postoperative outcomes of patients undergoing TRSE were compared with those of a group of 20 patients undergoing CL, who were matched for type of resection, body mass index and age. RESULTS The procedure was successful in all but the first patient who was converted to conventional laparoscopic colectomy without any additional morbidity. Two patients in the end-to-end anastomosis group, but none in the side-to-end group, developed peri-anastomotic sepsis. Compared with CL, patients undergoing TRSE did not show any significant differences in operative time, recovery or morbidity. CONCLUSION Transrectal specimen extraction after left colectomy using the circular stapler technique is feasible. A side-to-end anastomosis appears safer than an end-to-end anastomosis. Further studies are needed to explore the potential advantages of this procedure over CL.","Christoforidis, D; Clerc, D; Demartines, N",Colorectal disease : the official journal of the Association of Coloproctology of Great Britain and Ireland,10,8

We sought to examine why by systematically reviewing qualitative research examining general practitioners' ('GPs') and nurses' views of discussing weight with patients. We systematically searched English language publications (1945-2018) to identify qualitative interview and focus group studies. Thematic methods were used to synthesise the findings from these papers. We synthesised the studies by identifying second-order themes (explanations offered by the original researchers) and third-order constructs (new explanations which went beyond those in the original publications). Quality assessment using the Joanna Briggs checklist was undertaken. We identified 29 studies (>601 GPs, nurses and GP trainees) reporting views on discussing weight with patients. Key second-order themes were lack of confidence in treatments and patients' ability to make changes, stigma, interactional difficulty of discussing the topic and a belief of a wider societal responsibility needed to deal with patients with overweight and obesity. The third-order analytical theme was that discussions about weight were not a priority, and other behavioural interventions, including those relating to smoking, often took precedent. GPs and nurses reported that noting body mass index measurements at every consultation alongside a framework to deliver interventions would likely increase the frequency and perceived efficacy of behavioural weight interventions. GPs and nurses acknowledge the importance of obesity as a health issue, but this is insufficient, particularly amongst GPs, for them to construe this as a medical problem to address with patients in consultations. Strategies to implement clinical guidelines need to make tackling obesity a clinical priority. Training to overcome interactional difficulties, regular weighing of patients and changing expectations and understanding of weight loss interventions are also probably required.","Warr, William; Aveyard, Paul; Albury, Charlotte; Nicholson, Brian; Tudor, Kate; Hobbs, Richard; Roberts, Nia; Ziebland, Sue",Obesity reviews : an official journal of the International Association for the Study of Obesity,10,1

However, even in high-volume centres, surgical resection is associated with significant morbidity with resultant physical decline. This systematic review explored physical function and its' implications in the management of resectable cancer of the pancreas and liver. METHODS EMBASE, Medline OVID, CINAHL, Cochrane Library and Web of Science were searched up to June 2019 using a predefined search strategy. Screening of titles, abstracts, and full texts, data extraction, and risk of bias assessment was performed independently by two reviewers. A third reviewer resolved disagreements by consensus. RESULTS Sixteen studies with a total of 1224 participants were included. Heterogeneity of the literature prevented a meta-analysis. Physical function across the pancreatic/liver cancer trajectory has been under investigated. The relationship between physical function and pancreatic/liver cancer resection outcome remains unclear, although anaerobic threshold appears the strongest predictor of postoperative outcomes. Conclusions regarding the impact of rehabilitative interventions on physical function were limited due to risk of bias concerns. CONCLUSIONS High-quality evidence regarding the implications of physical function in resectable pancreatic and liver cancers is lacking. Well-designed trials are required to examine physical function across the pancreatic/liver cancer continuum and to measure the impact of rehabilitation on physical function. IMPLICATIONS FOR CANCER SURVIVORS As survival rates for pancreatic and liver cancer slowly improve a greater understanding of the impact of these cancers and their treatments on physical function, and the potential impact of rehabilitative interventions for survivors is required.","O'Neill, Linda; Reynolds, Sophie; Sheill, Gráinne; Guinan, Emer; Mockler, David; Geoghegan, Justin; Conlon, Kevin; Reynolds, John V; Hussey, Juliette",Journal of cancer survivorship : research and practice,10,1

Microarray analysis has the capability to offer robust multiplex detection but has just started to enter the diagnostic microbiology laboratory. Multiple microarray platforms exist, including printed double-stranded DNA and oligonucleotide arrays, in situ-synthesized arrays, high-density bead arrays, electronic microarrays, and suspension bead arrays. One aim of this paper is to review microarray technology, highlighting technical differences between them and each platform's advantages and disadvantages. Although the use of microarrays to generate gene expression data has become routine, applications pertinent to clinical microbiology continue to rapidly expand.

Agents can be faced with complex fitness landscapes derived from multi-stage tasks, interaction with others, and limited environmental feedback. Agents that evolve to overcome these can sometimes access greater fitness, as a result of factors such as cooperation and tool use. However, it is often difficult to explain why evolutionary agents behave in certain ways, and what specific elements of the environment or task may influence the ability of evolution to find goal-achieving behaviours; even seemingly simple environments or tasks may contain features that affect agent evolution in unexpected ways. We explore principled simplification of evolutionary agent-based models, as a possible route to aiding their explainability. Using the River Crossing Task (RCT) as a case study, we draw on analysis in the Minimal River Crossing (RC-) Task testbed, which was designed to simplify the original task while keeping its key features. Using this method, we present new analysis concerning when agents evolve to successfully complete the RCT. We demonstrate that the RC- environment can be used to understand the effect that a cost to movement has on agent evolution, and that these findings can be generalised back to the original RCT. Then, we present new insight into the use of principled simplification in understanding evolutionary agents. We find evidence that behaviour dependent on features that survive simplification, such as problem structure, are amenable to prediction; while predicting behaviour dependent on features that are typically reduced in simplification, such as scale, can be invalid.","Barnes, Chloe M; Ghouri, Abida; Lewis, Peter R",Artificial life,10,5

Cuff inflation currently is recommended at 20-30 cm H2O pressure. ETT designs have variable seal performance in bench studies using rigid tracheal models lacking the dynamic characteristics of the human trachea. We compared ETT designs within a new, biorealistic tracheal model to assess cuff and suction performance in the setting of a compliant trachea. METHODS Three ETT designs (Mallinckrodt Hi-Lo, KimVent Microcuff, and Sheridan/HVT) were tested for performance by simulant leakage below the cuff and air leakage (measured as return tidal volume ≥ 80% delivered) over a range of cuff (5-25 cm H2O) and end-expiratory pressure (PEEP 0-15 cm H2O). Subglottic suction channel performance was tested in 2 ETTs (TaperGuard Evac [Covidien] and ISIS HVT [Teleflex]) as time to evacuate the simulant. RESULTS All ETT cuffs provided effective seals at an inflation pressure of 12 cm H2O when PEEP was ≤ 5 cm H2O. The Microcuff ETT sealed at the lowest pressure of 6 cm H2O, whereas the Sheridan/HVT cuff sealed at 12 cm H2O (P = .01). With a PEEP of 15 cm H2O, a reciprocal increase in air leak occurred, requiring a cuff inflation up to 22 cm H2O to maintain a return tidal volume at ≥ 80% delivered. Suction channel performance improved in the lateral position compared with supine for both ETT designs during continuous 15 mm Hg suction pressure (P = .001). CONCLUSIONS Within a novel model with normal trachea compliance, we found all ETT designs tested to seal at lower than current recommended cuff pressures.","Rozycki, Sarah K; Dixon, Fredrick P; Yopp, Melissa A; Maxvold, Norma J; Rubin, Bruce K",Respiratory care,10,26

Numerous studies in small rodent models have demonstrated that hydrogen sulfide (H2S) induces hypometabolism, supposedly as a result of histotoxic hypoxia. However, the induction of hypometabolism is absent in large animals following H2S administration. To determine the cause of this animal size-dependent discrepancy in H2S pharmacodynamics, the effects of sodium H2S (NaSH; 5 mg/kg/h, 4-hour intravenous administration) on systemic, pneumocardial, hematological, biochemical, microvascular (sublingual), and histological parameters were investigated in pigs. After 4 h, no differences were observed between the NaSH and control group with respect to systemic, pneumocardial, hematological, biochemical, and histological parameters. However, NaSH triggered significant hyperperfusion in the sublingual microcirculation, as evidenced by an increased blood vessel diameter (154 ± 16 and 85 ± 25% vs. baseline for NaSH and NaCl, respectively), total vessel density (139 ± 18 and 98 ± 13%, respectively), and perfused vessel density (139 ± 18 and 99 ± 13%, respectively). These phenomena are consistent with microvascular changes that occur during a panting response, an important heat loss mechanism (i.e., thermoregulatory effector) in pigs that is controlled by the thermoneutral zone (Ztn). On the basis of our findings and the literature, a mechanistic explanation is provided for the differential manifestation of hypometabolism between small and large animals. In large animals, H2S does not act via histotoxic hypoxia but likely triggers carotid bodies to transmit a hypoxic signal, which subsequently lowers the Ztn and activates heat loss mechanisms (e.g., panting) to align ATP consumption with ATP production through hypothermia. Since large animals have a small surface:size ratio, the cooling rate is too inefficient to accommodate hypothermia and subsequent hypometabolism. This is why large animals do not exhibit hypometabolism, despite the activation of thermoregulatory effectors. This is also a reason for the poor translatability of artificial hypometabolism to the clinical setting.","Dirkes, Marcel C; Milstein, Dan M J; Heger, Michal; van Gulik, Thomas M",European surgical research.

One example is hernia repair, where fibrin gluing has become increasingly established as an alternative method for mesh fixation. Clinically, fixation with fibrin glue shows a reduced postoperative complication rate compared to other fixation methods (staples, sutures), particularly with regard to pain. MATERIALS AND METHODS Six different lightweight meshes were tested: TiMesh light, TiMesh extralight, Parietene light, Ultrapro, Optilene LP, and BARD Soft Mesh. Two millimeters Tissucol was used for fixation. Five meshes from each group were tested on muscular tissue with and without fibrin glue. The defined defect was 4.5 cm in diameter. The biomechanical measurements were taken in a standardized way using a materials testing machine. The minimum fixation strength required was 32 N, calculated from a corresponding model. RESULTS The fixation strength measurements without fibrin glue gave a mean value for all 30 meshes of 2.98 N with a SD of 0.92 N. This was far below the 32 N required. With fibrin glue, the mean of all the measurements (30 meshes) was 61.86 +/- 23.0 N (min 34.9 N, max 97.3 N). The lowest value was recorded for Ultrapro (34.9 +/- 12.5 N). All the other meshes had a significantly higher fixation strength when fixed with fibrin glue than Ultrapro (p = 0.001). The best results were found for Optilene LP, and this was significantly better than all the other meshes (97.3 +/- 8.9 N; p < 0.001). CONCLUSION Given the adequate stability and superior biocompatibility of lightweight large pore monofilament polypropylene meshes, heavyweight polypropylene meshes should no longer be used. It is possible to achieve adequate fixation of the meshes using fibrin glue. However, careful consideration should be given to the particular structure of the mesh in each case. Not every mesh is equally suitable for this purpose.","Schug-Pass, Christine; Lippert, Hans; Köckerling, Ferdinand",Langenbeck's archives of surgery,10,29

Repeat and chronic CED infusions have rarely been described for oncological purposes. Currently available CED devices are not approved for extended indwelling use, and the only potential at this time is for sequential treatments through multiple procedures. The authors report on the safety and experience in a group of pediatric patients who received sequential CED into the brainstem for the treatment of diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma. METHODS Patients in this study were enrolled in a phase I single-center clinical trial using 124I-8H9 monoclonal antibody (124I-omburtamab) administered by CED (clinicaltrials.gov identifier NCT01502917). A retrospective chart and imaging review were used to assess demographic data, CED infusion data, and postoperative neurological and surgical outcomes. MRI scans were analyzed using iPlan Flow software for volumetric measurements. Target and catheter coordinates as well as radial, depth, and absolute error in MRI space were calculated with the ClearPoint imaging software. RESULTS Seven patients underwent 2 or more sequential CED infusions. No patients experienced Clinical Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events grade 3 or greater deficits. One patient had a persistent grade 2 cranial nerve deficit after a second infusion. No patient experienced hemorrhage or stroke postoperatively. There was a statistically significant decrease in radial error (p = 0.005) and absolute tip error (p = 0.008) for the second infusion compared with the initial infusion. Sequential infusions did not result in significantly different distribution capacities between the first and second infusions (volume of distribution determined by the PET signal/volume of infusion ratio [mean ± SD]: 2.66 ± 0.35 vs 2.42 ± 0.75; p = 0.45). CONCLUSIONS This series demonstrates the ability to safely perform sequential CED infusions into the pediatric brainstem. Past treatments did not negatively influence the procedural workflow, technical application of the targeting interface, or distribution capacity.

BACKGROUND The COVID-19 pandemic brought rapid changes to the healthcare community. While a few studies have examined the early pandemic experiences of nurses in China and Europe, nurses' experiences across the United States have remained relatively underexplored. DESIGN A qualitative study design was used. METHODS Using a constructivist grounded theory methodology and methods, we conducted eight focus groups across four hospital sites in the eastern, midwestern and western United States. Registered nurses with a minimum of six months' experience working in all clinical specialties were eligible. Forty-three nurses participated. Data were analysed iteratively using the constant comparative method. The COREQ guidelines supported the work and reporting of this study. RESULTS The nurses experiencing a pandemic (NEXPIC) grounded theory emerged positing associations between four interrelated themes: Challenges, Feelings, Coping and Ethics. Nurses reported Challenges associated with changes in the work environment, community and themselves. They expressed more negative than positive feelings. Nurses coped using self-care techniques, and teamwork within the healthcare organisation. Moral dilemmas, moral uncertainty, moral distress, moral injury and moral outrage were ethical issues associated with nurses' Challenges during the pandemic. Moral courage was associated with positive Coping. CONCLUSIONS Awareness of frontline nurses' complex and interrelated needs may help healthcare organisations protect their human resources. This new theory provides preliminary theoretical support for future research and interventions to address the needs of frontline nurses. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE Nurses face added distress as frontline at-risk caregivers. Interventions to promote nurses' ability to cope with personal and professional challenges from the pandemic and address ethical issues are needed to protect the nursing workforce. This study offers a new substantive theory that may be used to underpin future interventions.","Kelley, Marjorie M; Zadvinskis, Inga; Miller, Pamela S; Monturo, Cheryl; Norful, Allison A; O'Mathúna, Dónal; Roberts, Haley; Smith, Julia; Tucker, Sharon; Zellefrow, Cindy; Chipps, Esther",Journal of clinical nursing,10,16

There are a number of neurological conditions that, if present in pilots and astronauts, carry variable (and sometimes adverse) functional implications for safety and overall mission success. In this systematic overview, the authors will refer to the relevant clinical and radiological features of brain tumors and vascular anomalies, cerebral edema and intracranial hypertension, concussion and the traumatic brain injury (TBI) spectrum, hematomas, cerebrospinal fluid circulation anomalies including hydrocephalus and sequestrations, spinal degenerative changes, and cerebral ischemia and demyelination. It is notable that these last two conditions have recently been reported to be a complication in some people with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). A paradigm for practical neurological workup of symptomatic pilots and astronauts will be discussed, as will the controversial notion of pre-emptive radiological screening (vs. not screening) in asymptomatic or clinically occult situations. The concepts of medical surveillance in the setting of known or diagnosed pathologies, and expert panel review and simulator and flight checks in complex neurological cases, are also elaborated on in this paper. We believe this overview will contribute toward the enhancement of a broad understanding of neurological conditions, their clinical workup, and their precautionary management in the setting of aviation and aerospace.Khurana VG, Jithoo R, Barnett M.

It mainly solves inaccurate calibration and small DOF problems at high magnification of vision systems. The mathematical camera model, initial camera calibration based on the iterative radial alignment constraint (IRAC) and optimization strategy are presented. The effectiveness, accuracy and practicality of the proposed calibration method are verified by both simulations and experiments. The root mean square errors of measured points in the 3D world coordinates with the proposed calibration method decrease from 22.02 μm to 1.66 μm when the magnification of the vision system increases from 0.12× to 0.66×. With the proposed calibration method based on the thin-lens model, accurate measurement, extended DOF and low calibration workload can be achieved.","Lu, Zhangji; Cai, Lilong",Optics express,10,29

OBJECTIVE To quantify glycemia, glycemic variability (GV), and magnitude/duration of low sensor glucose (SG) values in patients with PBH after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (PBH-RYGB). DESIGN Retrospective analysis. SETTING Academic medical center. PARTICIPANTS Individuals with PBH-RYGB (n=40), reactive hypoglycemia without GI surgery (Non-Surg Hypo, n=20), pre-diabetes (Pre-DM, n=14), newly-diagnosed T2D (n=5), and healthy controls (HC, n=38). INTERVENTIONS Masked CGM (Dexcom G4) was used to assess patterns over 24 hours, daytime (6 AM-midnight) and nighttime (midnight-6 AM).Outcome measures: Prespecified measures included mean and median SG, variability, and percent time at thresholds of sensor glucose. RESULTS Mean and median SG were similar for PBH-RYGB and HC (mean: 99.8±18.6 vs. 96.9±10.2 mg/dL; median: 93.0±14.8 vs. 94.5±7.4 mg/dL). PBH-RYGB had a higher coefficient of variation (27.3±6.8 vs. 17.9±2.4%, p<0.0001) and range (154.5±50.4 vs. 112.0±26.7 mg/dL, p<0.0001). Nadir was lowest in PBH-RYGB (42.5±3.7 vs. HC 49.0±11.9 mg/dL, p=0.0046), with >2-fold greater time with SG<70 mg/dL vs. HC (7.7±8.4 vs. 3.2±4.1%, p=0.0013); these differences were greater at night (12.6±16.9 vs. 1.0±1.5%, p<0.0001). Non-Surg Hypo also had 4-fold greater time with SG<70 at night vs. HC (SG <70: 4.0 ± 5.9% vs 1.0 ± 1.5%), but glycemic variability was not increased. CONCLUSIONS Patients with PBH-RYGB experience higher glycemic variability and frequency of SG<70 compared to HC, especially at night. These data suggest that additional pathophysiologic mechanisms beyond prandial changes contribute to PBH.","Lee, Daniel; Dreyfuss, Jonathan M; Sheehan, Amanda; Puleio, Alexa; Mulla, Christopher M; Patti, Mary Elizabeth",The Journal of clinical endocrinology and metabolism,10,1

In the present parafoveal preview study conducted in Finnish, we examined the exact nature of this effect by comparing reading of morphologically complex words (a stem + two suffixes) to that of monomorphemic words. In the preview-change condition, the final 3-4 letters were replaced with other letters making the target word a pseudoword; for suffixed words, the word stem remained intact but the suffix information was unavailable; for monomorphemic words, only part of the stem was parafoveally available. Three alternative predictions were put forth. According to the first alternative, the morphological effect in initial fixation location is due to parafoveally perceiving the suffix as a highly frequent letter cluster and then adjusting the saccade program to land closer to the word beginning for suffixed than monomorphemic words. The second alternative, the processing difficulty hypothesis, assumes a morphological complexity effect: suffixed words are more complex than monomorphemic words. Therefore, the attentional window is narrower and the saccade is shorter. The third alternative posits that the effect reflects parafoveal access to the word's stem. The results for the initial fixation location and fixation durations were consistent with the parafoveal stem-access view.","Hyönä, Jukka; Heikkilä, Timo T; Vainio, Seppo; Kliegl, Reinhold",Cognition,10,1

These interactions critically depend on N-glycosylation at Asn297 of each CH2 domain, where biantennary complex-type oligosaccharides contain microheterogeneities resulting primarily from the presence or absence of non-reducing terminal galactose residues. Crystal structures of Fc have shown that a pair of N-glycans is located between the two CH2 domains. Here we applied our metabolic isotope labeling technique using mammalian cells for in-solution structural characterization of mouse IgG2b-Fc glycoforms with a molecular mass of 54 kDa. Based on spectral assignments of the N-glycans as well as polypeptide backbones of Fc, we probed conformational perturbations of Fc induced by N-glycan trimming, especially enzymatic degalactosylation. The results indicated that degalactosylation structurally perturbed the Fc region through rearrangement of glycan-protein interactions. The spectral assignments of IgG2b-Fc glycoprotein will provide the basis for NMR investigation of its dynamic conformations and interactions with effector molecules in solution.","Yanaka, Saeko; Yamaguchi, Yoshiki; Takizawa, Takeshi; Miyanoiri, Yohei; Yogo, Rina; Shimada, Ichio; Kato, Koichi",Biomolecular NMR assignments,10,31

We hypothesized that nuclear stiffness is a limiting factor in migration and posited that repair could be expedited by transiently decreasing nuclear stiffness. To test this, we interrogated the interstitial migratory capacity of adult meniscal cells through dense fibrous networks and adult tissue before and after nuclear softening via the application of a histone deacetylase inhibitor, Trichostatin A (TSA) or knockdown of the filamentous nuclear protein Lamin A/C. Our results show that transient softening of the nucleus improves migration through microporous membranes, electrospun fibrous matrices, and tissue sections and that nuclear properties and cell function recover after treatment. We also showed that biomaterial delivery of TSA promoted in vivo cellularization of scaffolds by endogenous cells. By addressing the inherent limitations to repair imposed by nuclear stiffness, this work defines a new strategy to promote the repair of damaged dense connective tissues.","Heo, Su-Jin; Song, Kwang Hoon; Thakur, Shreyasi; Miller, Liane M; Cao, Xuan; Peredo, Ana P; Seiber, Breanna N; Qu, Feini; Driscoll, Tristan P; Shenoy, Vivek B; Lakadamyali, Melike; Burdick, Jason A; Mauck, Robert L",Science advances,10,24

Acetazolamide inhibits carbonic anhydrase, an enzyme that accelerates carbonic acid formation. We hypothesized that preoperative administration of acetazolamide would decrease postoperative pain in patients undergoing laparoscopic inguinal herniorrhaphy. METHODS A retrospective review was conducted of patients who underwent laparoscopic preperitoneal inguinal herniorrhaphy at the Medical College of Wisconsin between October 2012 and September 2014. Beginning in January 2014, patients began receiving 250 mg of acetazolamide preoperatively; patients prior to that time did not. The visual analog scale (range 0-10) was used to assess both preoperative pain and postoperative pain. RESULTS A total of 66 patients underwent laparoscopic inguinal herniorrhaphy during the study interval. Of these, 22 (33 %) patients received acetazolamide preoperatively, and 44 (67 %) were included as controls. Overall mean pain scores were lower in the acetazolamide group (1.9 ± 1.45 vs 2.9 ± 1.5, p = 0.04). Specifically, patients who received acetazolamide reported lower pain scores immediately after surgery (0.6 ± 1.2 vs 1.9 ± 2.3, p = 0.01) and on post-op day one (2.3 ± 0.9 vs 4.0 ± 2.1, p = 0.04). Total morphine equivalents administered to manage postoperative pain were significantly less for the acetazolamide group (4.3 ± 4.8 mg) when compared to the control group (8.9 ± 8.4 mg), p = 0.04. Perioperative complications did not differ between the groups (p = 0.16). CONCLUSIONS Acetazolamide appears to reduce pain in the immediate postoperative setting. Patients who received acetazolamide had lower pain scores postoperatively and required fewer narcotics for pain management prior to discharge.","Pourladian, Irene; Lois, Alex W; Frelich, Matthew J; Woehlck, Harvey J; Weber, Michelle; Kastenmeier, Andrew S; Gould, Jon C; Goldblatt, Matthew I",Surgical endoscopy,10,1

Recent articles warn of possible long-term consequences on mental health, especially for those who suffer from underlying psychiatric conditions and for vulnerable sections of the population. The present study explores the psychological impact of the COVID-19 quarantine on outpatients at the Centre of Child and Adolescent Mental Health (CAMHS), which is based in Barcelona. METHODS A total of 441 caregivers answered an online ad-hoc survey on their sociodemographic and economic situation, perceived stress, and clinical changes and coping strategies observed in their children during lockdown. The Chi-square test was used to compare the response percentages for each behaviour or symptom between age, gender and diagnostic groups. Variance and post-hoc test were also analyzed, as was the Pearson correlation. RESULTS The use of electronic devices has significantly increased. There has also been an increase in symptoms such as attentional problems, fatigue and irritability, among others. Differences were found between age and gender groups. The diagnostic groups most affected by confinement were Autism Spectrum Disorders and Conduct Disorders. The survey also discovered a relationship between the loss of family income, parental stress and increased symptoms in children. CONCLUSION Confinement has increased externalizing symptoms and behaviours as well as Covid-19 related concerns, somatic problems and anxieties. It is important to observe the fluctuation of symptoms and how young people adapt to the pandemic in order to reach a better understanding of the situation and devise new strategies to reduce the psychological impact of the pandemic.","Lopez-Serrano, Jara; Díaz-Bóveda, Rosalía; González-Vallespí, Laura; Santamarina-Pérez, Pilar; Bretones-Rodríguez, Antonia; Calvo, Rosa; LeraMiguel, Sara",Revista de psiquiatria y salud mental,10,30

The aims of this study were to evaluate mental health outcomes among patients with COVID-19 treated in the Fangcang shelter hospitals and analyze potential risk factors associated with these symptoms, including PTSS, symptoms of anxiety, depression, insomnia, and perceived stress. METHOD This cross-sectional study used an online survey to assess mental health problems of 461 confirmed COVID-19 patients in a Jianghan Fangcang shelter from February 15 to 22, 2020. A multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed to explore potential risk factors. RESULTS Overall, 25.2%, 50.1%, 54.4%, 10.2%, and 39.7% of all patients reported symptoms of posttraumatic stress, anxiety, depression, insomnia, and perceived stress, respectively. Multivariable logistic regression analysis showed that female sex was associated with all investigated outcomes except insomnia. Patients with lower education level were more likely to endorse anxiety, depression, and higher perceived stress, while patients' family members with other diseases were more likely to endorse severe insomnia. Patients with illness onset to admission less than 7 days were associated with higher perceived stress. DISCUSSION In this survey study, patients reported high rates of symptoms of posttraumatic stress, anxiety, depression, insomnia, and perceived stress. Combining with the special environment of the shelter hospitals and patient's psychological needs, the health care workers should give more effective interventions to relieve the patients' stress and improve their mental symptoms.","Gu, Yingqi; Zhu, Yi; Xu, Fangzhong; Xi, Juzhe; Xu, Guangxing",Asia-Pacific psychiatry : official journal of the Pacific Rim College of Psychiatrists,10,1

Increased patient access to medical information and education has elicited interest in minimally invasive surgical techniques that obtain improved surgical outcomes and cosmesis. Because of these factors, there is a growing interest in single-incision surgery. Laparoscopic totally extraperitoneal (TEP) single-incision hernia repair technique has been reported with different meshes used in a tack fixation system. Recently, self-fixating mesh technology has offered the possibility of avoiding tack fixation and potentially avoiding chronic postoperative pain. Self-fixating mesh technology employs monofilament polylactic acid (PLA) creating a microgrip system that provides self-adherence of the mesh to adjacent tissue. This tack-free fixation system provides coverage over the entire myopectineal orifice and surrounding areas where traditional tacks cannot be placed. Self-fixating mesh has also been safely applied in laparoscopic TEP procedures, but this mesh has not been described in single site TEP surgery; possibly because of the potential difficulty with mesh deployment. We sought to determine the technical feasibility of a single-site laparoscopic TEP repair of inguinal hernias and to discuss our techniques and patient short-term outcomes. METHODS Review of a prospectively maintained database of patients who received single-site laparoscopic TEP herniorrhaphy from August 2012 through August 2015. Patient characteristics and demographics and perioperative and postoperative data were analyzed. RESULTS Thirty-four patients (aged 55.2 ±14.2; 17.6% women) with a mean body mass index of 26.2 ± 3.9 were analyzed. Mean operative time was 99.5 ± 30.5 minutes, 41.2% were left-side repairs, and 50% were bilateral. Estimated blood loss was 18.4 ± 14.1 mL. Recurrent hernias accounted for 14.7% of cases; 32.4% of cases were combination surgeries, most commonly a concurrent umbilical hernia repair. The most common short-term postoperative complication was urinary retention (4 patients). The median length of follow-up was 25 days (IQR 18.75-61.75). Complications occurring at >30 days included hydrocele (2 patients) and stitch abscess (1 patient). Eight (23.5%) patients had complications (surgical or during follow-up). No recurrences or deaths were reported. CONCLUSIONS With comparable operative times, perioperative outcomes, and safety profile, SS-TEP appears to be a safe and effective surgical approach for the management of inguinal hernias in the short term. Furthermore, SS-TEP with a self-fixating mesh is a feasible approach.","Guerron, Alfredo D; Lee, Hui-Jie; Yoo, Jin; Seymour, Keri; Sudan, Ranjan; Portenier, Dana; Park, Chan",JSLS : Journal of the Society of Laparoendoscopic Surgeons,10,17

To perform their functions, many GPCRs must accumulate inside primary cilia, microtubule-based plasma membrane protrusions working as cellular antennae. Nevertheless, the molecular mechanisms underlying GPCR ciliary targeting remain poorly understood. Serotonin receptor 6 (HTR6) and somatostatin receptor 3 (SSTR3) are two brain-enriched ciliary GPCRs involved in cognition and pathologies such as Alzheimer's disease and cancer. Although the third intracellular loops (IC3) of HTR6 and SSTR3 suffice to target non-ciliary GPCRs to cilia, these IC3s are dispensable for ciliary targeting of HTR6 and SSTR3 themselves, suggesting these GPCRs contain additional ciliary targeting sequences (CTSs). Herein, we discover and characterize novel CTSs in HTR6 and SSTR3 C-terminal tails (CT). These CT-CTSs (CTS2) act redundantly with IC3-CTSs (CTS1), each being sufficient for ciliary targeting. In HTR6, RKQ and LPG motifs are critical for CTS1 and CTS2 function, respectively, whereas in SSTR3 these roles are mostly fulfilled by AP[AS]CQ motifs in IC3 and juxtamembrane residues in CT. Furthermore, we shed light on how these CTSs promote ciliary targeting by modulating binding to ciliary trafficking adapters TULP3 and RABL2.","Barbeito, Pablo; Tachibana, Yuki; Martin-Morales, Raquel; Moreno, Paula; Mykytyn, Kirk; Kobayashi, Tetsuo; Garcia-Gonzalo, Francesc R",Life science alliance,10,1

Overall, there was no statistically significant interaction between time and treatment group with regard to SOFA score over the 72 hours after enrollment (mean SOFA score change from 9.1 to 4.4 [-4.7] points with intervention vs 9.2 to 5.1 [-4.1] points with placebo; adjusted mean difference, -0.8; 95% CI, -1.7 to 0.2; P = .12 for interaction). There was no statistically significant difference in the incidence of kidney failure (31.7% with intervention vs 27.3% with placebo; adjusted risk difference, 0.03; 95% CI, -0.1 to 0.2; P = .58) or in 30-day mortality (34.7% vs 29.3%, respectively; hazard ratio, 1.3; 95% CI, 0.8-2.2; P = .26). The most common serious adverse events were hyperglycemia (12 patients with intervention and 7 patients with placebo), hypernatremia (11 and 7 patients, respectively), and new hospital-acquired infection (13 and 12 patients, respectively). Conclusions and Relevance In patients with septic shock, the combination of ascorbic acid, corticosteroids, and thiamine, compared with placebo, did not result in a statistically significant reduction in SOFA score during the first 72 hours after enrollment. These data do not support routine use of this combination therapy for patients with septic shock.

Herein, we examine the impact of virtualising genetics services at Canada's largest cancer centre. A retrospective review was conducted to evaluate relevant metrics during the 12 weeks prior to and during virtual care, including referral and clinic volumes, patient wait times and genetic testing uptake. The number of appointments and new patients seen were maintained during virtual care. Likewise, there was a significant increase in the number of patients offered testing during virtual care who did not provide a blood sample (176/180 (97.7%) vs 180/243 (74.1%); p<0.001), and a longer median time from the date of pretest genetic counselling to the date a sample was given (0 vs 11 days; p<0.001). Referral volumes significantly decreased during virtual care (35 vs 22; p<0.001), which was accompanied by a decreased median wait time for first appointment (55 days vs 30 days; p<0.001). The rapid virtualisation of cancer genetic services allowed the genetics clinic to navigate the COVID-19 pandemic without compromising clinical volumes or access to genetic testing. There was a decrease in referral volumes and uptake of genetic testing, which may be attributable to pandemic-related clinical restrictions.","Norman, Maia Leigh; Malcolmson, Janet; Randall Armel, Susan; Gillies, Brittany; Ou, Brian; Thain, Emily; McCuaig, Jeanna Marie; Kim, Raymond H",Journal of medical genetics,10,27

Medical students are a potential pool for blood donors. The aim of this study was to determine overall attitudes of medical students at a single academic institution toward blood donation during times of increased need. METHODS Three anonymous REDCap surveys were administered to all medical students at a rural academic institution. Surveys 1 and 2 were administered preceding and after an institution-wide MCI drill, in September and November 2019, respectively. Survey 3 was administered following a student-organized COVID-19 blood drive in June 2020. Multivariable analysis was performed to determine if factors, ie, experience with MCI drills and emergency medical services (EMS) training, were associated with willingness to donate blood. Furthermore, barriers to donation among those not willing to donate were assessed. RESULTS Overall response rate for MCI surveys (surveys 1 and 2) was 38% (mean age 25.2 years and 50% women). 91% (n = 210) of respondents were willing to donate blood. Previous participation in MCI drills and EMS training was not associated with higher willingness to donate blood. Response rate for survey 3 was 15.6% (59.4% women), and 30 (31.3%) respondents indicated they did not volunteer to donate blood during the COVID-19 drive. Most common reasons for not donating were ""other,"" medical concerns, and being out-of-town. CONCLUSIONS Majority of medical students are willing to donate blood during times of increased need and offer a possible solution to increase blood donor pool.","Khatun, Rahima; Otaibi, Banan W; Ssentongo, Anna; Hazelton, Joshua P; Cooper, AmandaB",The American surgeon,10,1

We retrospectively analyzed medical records of 43 patients with platinum-refractory metastatic bladder cancer (mBC) who participated in one or more phase 1 trials of various investigational therapies. Patients' tumors or circulating tumor DNA were analyzed by next generation sequencing. Median progression-free survival was 4.2 months, median overall survival was 9.6 months, and the overall response rate was 17.5%. TP53, ERBB2, PI3KCA, FGFR3 and ARID1A alterations were detected in 66%, 29%, 27%, 24%, and 22% of all patients, respectively. Alterations in FGFR3 were almost mutually exclusive of TP53. More than half (64%) of patients with an FGFR alt received an FGFR inhibitor, 67% of which, achieved disease control. Among patients with urothelial carcinoma histology, those harboring a TP53 alteration had a shorter median PFS compared to those whose tumors carry wild-type TP53. The reverse relationship was observed in patients harboring an FGFR alteration. Implications: Patients with platinum-refractory mBC derive clinical benefit from participating in early phase clinical trials and their survival outcomes correlate with the genetic profile of the tumor.","Alhalabi, Omar; Hahn, Andrew W; Msaouel, Pavlos; Andreev-Drakhlin, Alexander Y; Meric-Bernstam, Funda; Naing, Aung; Piha-Paul, Sarina; Filip, Janku; Pant, Shubham; Yap, Timothy A; Hong, David S; Fu, Siqing; Karp, Daniel; Campbell, Erick; Le, Hung; Campbell, Matthew T; Shah, Amishi Y; Tannir, Nizar M; Siefker-Radtke, Arlene O; Gao, Jianjun; Roszik, Jason; Subbiah, Vivek",Molecular cancer research : MCR,10,1

Few studies have assessed the effect of socioeconomic conditions on sleep in the COVID-19 pandemic. Our objective was to analyze the increase or incidence of sleep disorders according to demographic and economic conditions, prior to the pandemic, and according to changes in financial, occupational, and household conditions during the pandemic. This study was conducted via web access, using data from April 24 to May 24, with 45,160 Brazilians (aged 18 or older), with a sample weighted by Brazilian National Household Sample Survey (PNAD) data. Change in sleep quality (outcome), monthly income, effect on family income, occupation/work, gender, age group, marital status, and change in domestic work (exposures) were reported. The percentages of onset or increase of sleep disorders and adjusted odds ratio were estimated. The chance of exacerbation of sleep disorders was 34%, 71%, and twice as high in people with income less than one minimum wage before the pandemic, in those who lost their job and in those who had a great decrease in their income/were without income, respectively. The chance of worsening sleep disorders was 82% higher in women; three times higher (OR = 3.14) in the population aged from 18 to 29, compared to the older adults; and higher with the increase in the amount of housework (OR = 2.21). Financial and occupational factors were determinants in the worsening of self-reported sleep quality, requiring rapid actions on these conditions in order to minimize this effect. Gender, age group, and household routines also deserve attention regarding sleep quality.","Lima, Margareth Guimarães; Barros, Marilisa Berti de Azevedo; Szwarcwald, Celia Landmann; Malta, Deborah Carvalho; Romero, Dalia Elena; Werneck, André Oliveira; Souza Júnior, Paulo Roberto Borges de",Cadernos de saude publica,10,1

Nous avons évalué comment différentes interventions non pharmacologiques pouvaient être utilisées pour maîtriser la pandémie de COVID-19 (maladie à coronavirus 2019) et alléger le fardeau qu’elle impose au système de santé. MÉTHODES: Nous avons utilisé un modèle à compartiments structuré selon l’âge pour faire une analyse de la transmission de la COVID-19 dans la population de l’Ontario, au Canada. Nous avons comparé un scénario de référence, soit dépistage limité, isolement et quarantaine, à des scénarios incluant dépistage accru, mesures strictes d’éloignement physique, ou combinaison de dépistage accru et d’éloignement physique moins strict. Les interventions étaient appliquées soit pendant des durées fixes, soit selon un cycle dynamique en fonction de l’occupation projetée des lits dans les unités de soins intensifs (USI). Nous présentons les médianes et les intervalles de crédibilité tirés de 100 expériences répliquées par scénario sur un horizon temporel de 2 ans. RÉSULTATS: Selon le scénario de référence, nous avons estimé que 56 % (intervalle de crédibilité de 95 %, 42 %–63 %) de la population ontarienne contractait l’infection pendant l’épidémie. Au moment du sommet épidémique, nous avons projeté 107 000 (intervalle de crédibilité de 95 %, 60 760–149 000) hospitalisations (soins standards) et 55 500 (intervalle de crédibilité de 95 %, 32 700–75 200) hospitalisations dans les USI. Pour les scénarios à durée fixe, selon les projections, toutes les interventions retardaient et réduisaient la hauteur du sommet épidémique par rapport au scénario de référence, et ce sont les mesures d’éloignement physique strict qui exerçaient le plus d’effet; de même, les interventions de durée plus longue étaient plus efficaces. Selon les projections, les interventions dynamiques réduisaient la proportion de la population atteinte à la fin de la période de 2 ans et pouvaient ramener le nombre médian de cas dans les USI en deçà des estimations actuelles de leur capacité en Ontario. INTERPRÉTATION: Sans éloignement physique substantiel ou une combinaison d’éloignement physique modéré et de dépistage accru, nous projetons que les ressources des USI pourraient être insuffisantes. L’éloignement physique dynamique maintiendrait la capacité du système de santé en plus de donner un répit psychologique et économique périodique aux populations.","Tuite, Ashleigh R; Fisman, David N; Greer, Amy L",CMAJ : Canadian Medical Association journal = journal de l'Association medicale canadienne,10,12

Often, emergence of resistance and/or undesired side effects that are discovered only after prolonged clinical use, result in discontinuation of clinical use. Since the cost and time required for improvement of existing drugs are considerably lower than those required for the development of novel drugs, academic and pharmaceutical company researchers pursue this direction. In this account we describe selected examples of how chemical probes generated from antimicrobial drugs and chemical and enzymatic modifications of these drugs have been used to modify modes of action, block mechanisms of resistance, or reduce side effects, improving performance. These examples demonstrate how new and comprehensive mechanistic insights can be translated into fresh concepts for development of next-generation antimicrobial agents.","Jaber, Qais Z; Fridman, Micha",Chemical record,10,1

In the present study, the sediment removal from double bottom ballast tanks due to flow-through ballast water exchange is investigated by simplified experimental and numerical models. Two flow rates and two sediment densities were considered to verify their influence on the process. Besides, the effectiveness of two tank configuration modifications to improve the sediments removal was investigated. The first is the introduction of a flow deflector inside the tank and the second is the water inflow from the bottom. A fully Lagrangian particle-based method is adopted to simulate the sediment removal process with complex tank geometry. A new boundary condition is proposed to model the mesh of the bottom inlet in the bottom inflow configuration. Despite the simplifications of the numerical model, the computational results are in good agreement with the experimental ones. The results show that the flow-through ballast water exchange method might not be effective to remove the sediments entrapped between the bottom stiffeners, and the proposed modifications, despite challenging implementation, improve the sediment removal.","Pereira, Lucas Soares; Cheng, Liang-Yee; Ribeiro, Gabriel Henrique de Souza; Osello, Pedro Henrique Saggioratto; Motezuki, Fabio Kenji; Pereira, Newton Narciso",Marine pollution bulletin,10,31

METHODS Ninety-five consecutive patients (11 male, 84 female; mean BMI 45 ± 6 kg/m2) undergoing RYGB 9 ± 4 years ago were treated for 24 months as follows: Patients, who gained less than 10% from weight NADIR, served as controls and were provided lifestyle counseling (DC, n = 30). The others were allowed to choose between three different treatment groups: daily s.c. administration of liraglutide (LG, n = 34); endosurgery using Apollo's Overstitch System™ (ES, n = 15), or implantation of a Fobi-ring with pouch resizing (FP, n = 16). RESULTS Controls kept their weight stable during 24 months of study (- 0.1 ± 1.7 kg/m2). Weight loss was 4.8 ± 2.9 kg/m2 for LG and 5.5 ± 2.9 kg/m2 for FP, both losing more than 85% of regained weight from weight NADIR (p < 0.001). In contrast, weight loss in ES was 1.0 ± 0.9 kg/m2 (i.e., 20% of regained weight). Thirty-seven percent of FP experienced serious complications (p < 0.05) in contrast to the other groups. An improved prevalence of hypertension and dyslipidemia was observed in LG and FP (p < 0.02) 24 months after intervention. CONCLUSIONS Weight regain during more than 6 years after RYGB can be safely and effectively reversed with liraglutide. Compared with revisional surgery, pharmacotherapy with liraglutide was low risk and resulted in an important improvement in hypertension and dyslipidemia. Therefore, daily subcutaneous injections of liraglutide are a valid option to treat weight regain after RYGB.","Horber, Fritz F; Steffen, Rudolf",Obesity surgery,10,31

This study aimed to validate AET reference ranges and diagnostic thresholds by analysis of 96-hour wireless pH studies from healthy, asymptomatic controls (HCs) and patients with and without oesophagitis. DESIGN HC and consecutive patients referred for wireless pH studies (off acid suppressants for >7 days) underwent 96-hour pH studies at two tertiary referral centres. Erosive oesophagitis was categorised by the Los Angeles (LA) classification. Linear regression and receiver operating curve (ROC) analysis were performed to define optimal diagnostic cut-offs. RESULTS Prolonged, 96-hour pH studies were completed in 39 HCs (age 28 (18-53) years, 72% female) and 944 patients (age 46 (16-85) years, 65% female), of whom 136 (14.5%) had reflux oesophagitis. Median AET in HC was 1.3% (upper 95th percentile 4.6%) for any study day and 2.6% (upper 95th percentile 6.9%) for the worst day (24-hour period) during the study. ROC analysis for average AET differentiated HC from patients with moderate-to-severe oesophagitis (LA BCD; sensitivity 87%, specificity 95%, positive predictive value (PPV) 59%, negative predictive value 99% for a cut-off AET of 4.3%; area under the receiver operating curve 0.95). Specificity was higher, but PPV was substantially lower for severe oesophagitis (LA CD). 'Worst-day' analysis provided similar results; however, day-to-day variability was high. CONCLUSION Diagnostic thresholds for average AET were identified that accurately discriminate between HCs and patients with erosive oesophagitis. The findings provide conditional support for diagnostic criteria for GORD proposed by the Lyon Consensus.","Rusu, Radu-Ionut; Fox, Mark R; Tucker, Emily; Zeki, Sebastian; Dunn, Jason M; Jafari, Jafar; Warburton, Fiona; Wong, Terry",Gut,10,32

Subjective feelings related to social relationships such as detachment have shown a strong effect on mental health, whereas objective factors might have a moderating role in that association. OBJECTIVE To investigate whether social support and living situation have a moderating effect on the association between detachment and affective disorder symptoms during the COVID-19 lockdown. METHODS 3,305 Spanish adults were interviewed by phone at the end of the COVID-19 lockdown (May-June 2020). Detachment during confinement was assessed with a single-item frequency question. Anxiety symptoms were measured through GAD-7, depressive symptoms through PHQ-9, and social support through the Oslo Social Support Scale (OSSS). Associations with anxiety and depressive symptoms were tested through Tobit regression models. Interactions of detachment with living situation and social support were tested as independent variables. RESULTS People living alone showed significantly lower levels of anxiety whereas people living with another (but not as a couple) showed higher levels of depression. Detachment was strongly associated with both affective disorders. Social support had a statistically significant moderating effect on that association. Those with a low level of social support and a high level of detachment reported means of depression and anxiety above major depression (10.5 CI 95% 9.6, 11.4 at OSSS=10) and generalized anxiety disorders (10.1 CI 95% 9.2, 11.0 at OSSS=9) cut offs CONCLUSION: Interventions centered on improving social support could alleviate feelings of detachment and prevent affective disorders during lockdowns.","Domènech-Abella, Joan; Gabarrell-Pascuet, Aina; Faris, Lydia Hanaa; Cristóbal-Narváez, Paula; Félez-Nobrega, Mireia; Mortier, Philippe; Vilagut, Gemma; Olaya, Beatriz; Alonso, Jordi; Haro, Josep Maria",Journal of affective disorders,10,28

METHODS The sample of this descriptive, correlational and cross-sectional study comprised 370 nurses working at one private and two university hospitals in Turkey. A demographic information form, the Practice Work Environment Scale of the Nursing Work Index (PES-NWI) and the Nursing Job Performance Scale (JPS) were used to collect the data. Data were analysed using descriptive statistics, Spearman's correlation and multiple linear (stepwise) regression. RESULTS There was a significant and positive correlation between the scores on the PES-NWI and the JPS (r: 0.65, p < .05). Regression analysis showed that nurses' job performance was affected by five variables (R2 : 59%, p < .05, Durbin-Watson: 2.06). CONCLUSION The results of the study show that three sub-dimensions of the PES-NWI (nursing foundations for quality of care; staffing and resource adequacy; nurse manager abilities, leadership and support for nurses), colleague solidarity and education level were important factors affecting job performance. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE The job performance of nurses is a priority issue in delivering quality healthcare services. Further efforts need to be pursued to nurse managers ensure a positive work environment to increase their nurses' job performance.","Sarıköse, Seda; Göktepe, Nilgün",Journal of clinical nursing,10,1

Some viruses may be secreted into milk - others may be contaminants. The effect of thermal pasteurization on viruses in HM has yet to be rigorously reviewed. The objective of this study is to characterize the effect of common pasteurization techniques on viruses in HM and non-HM matrices. Databases (MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science) were searched from inception to April 20th, 2020 for primary research articles assessing the impact of pasteurization on viral load or detection of live virus. Reviews were excluded, as were studies lacking quantitative measurements or those assessing pasteurization as a component of a larger process. Overall, of 65,131 reports identified, 109 studies were included. Pasteurization of HM at a minimum temperature of 56ºC-60ºC is effective at reducing detectable live virus. In cell culture media or plasma, coronaviruses (e.g., SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2, MERS-CoV) are highly susceptible to heating at ≥56ºC. Although pasteurization parameters and matrices reported vary, all viruses studied, except parvoviruses, were susceptible to thermal killing. Future research important for the study of novel viruses should standardize pasteurization protocols and should test inactivation in human milk. Novelty bullets •In all matrices, including human milk, pasteurization at 62.5ºC was generally sufficient to reduce surviving viral load by several logs or to below the limit of detection. •Holder pasteurization (62.5ºC, 30 min) of human milk should be sufficient to inactivate non-heat resistant viruses, including coronaviruses, if present.","Pitino, Michael A; O'Connor, Deborah L; McGeer, Allison J; Unger, Sharon","Applied physiology, nutrition, and metabolism = Physiologie appliquee, nutrition et metabolisme",10,16

Furthermore, it activates the fusion protein F of the human metapneumovirus and the spike protein S of the SARS-CoV (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus). Increased TMPRSS2 expression was also described in several tumour entities. Therefore TMPRSS2 emerged as a potential target for drug design. The catalytic domain of TMPRSS2 was expressed in Escherichia coli and used for an inhibitor screen with previously synthesized inhibitors of various trypsin-like serine proteases. Two inhibitor types were identified which inhibit TMPRSS2 in the nanomolar range. The first series comprises substrate analogue inhibitors containing a 4-amidinobenzylamide moiety at the P1 position, whereby some of these analogues possess inhibition constants of approximately 20 nM. An improved potency was found for a second type derived from sulfonylated 3-amindinophenylalanylamide derivatives. The most potent derivative of this series inhibits TMPRSS2 with a K(i) value of 0.9 nM and showed an efficient blockage of influenza virus propagation in human airway epithelial cells. On the basis of the inhibitor studies, a series of new fluorogenic substrates containing a D-arginine residue at the P3 position was synthesized, some of them were efficiently cleaved by TMPRSS2.","Meyer, Daniela; Sielaff, Frank; Hammami, Maya; Böttcher-Friebertshäuser, Eva; Garten, Wolfgang; Steinmetzer, Torsten",The Biochemical journal,10,7

Surgical repair may be needed, however prior LSG precludes standard HH repair with fundoplication. METHODS We retrospectively reviewed our experience with bariatric patients with prior LSG undergoing laparoscopic HH repair from August 2010 to July 2016. Patient demographics and outcomes including mortality, length of stay (LOS), readmission rates, reoperation, and complications were described. A validated 13-point questionnaire was used to determine symptomatic relief, weight loss, and overall satisfaction. RESULTS A total of nine consecutive patients with prior LSG underwent HH repair and were included in the analysis. Repair was performed using Bio-A Gore® mesh (W.L Gore Inc., Newark, DE) in six (66.7%) cases and posterior cruroplasty in three (33.3%) patients. Heartburn was significantly decreased at 1 year (1.4 ± 0.9 vs. 2.6 ± 0.9, p = 0.031), and 78% of patients reported some degree of symptomatic relief after HH repair. CONCLUSIONS Laparoscopic HH repair offers a safe and feasible approach in the management of persistent GERD after LSG in well-selected bariatric patients. Larger prospective studies are warranted to investigate the effectiveness of HH repair in this population as 22% of our patients did not demonstrate postoperative symptomatic improvement.","Macedo, Francisco Igor B; Mowzoon, Mia; Mittal, Vijay K; Sabir, Mubashir",Obesity surgery,10,9

In the present study, composite structures of lysozyme amyloid fibrils with zein proteins were fabricated using the antisolvent precipitation method by applying different blending and pH adjustment sequences. Globular prolamins were bound to the amyloid fibrils to combine their respective advantages. The dynamic light scattering showed that the composites with a characteristic stabilized behavior (43.60 ± 1.75 mV ~ 35.20 ± 0.65 mV) were formed at pH 4.0-5.0, in which non-covalent interactions between fibril and particles occurred. Two different structures, fruit tree-like structure and beaded-like structure, were presented in AFM and TEM images due to the different pH adjustment sequences, while blending sequences had negligible effect on the morphology of the composites. A fruit tree-like entity was detected for lysozyme fibrils-zein composites, where its ""branches"" bear zein globular particles. A beaded-like structure was observed for lysozyme fibrils-zein composites, where lysozyme fibril was the thread and zein aggregates were the beads. The potential mechanism of this phenomenon can be explained as the fruit tree-like structure being primarily formed through electrostatic interactions while the beaded-like structure is mainly caused by hydrophobic interactions. The composites of fruit tree-like structures hold a more promising stability than those with beaded-like structures. The results of this research would give constructive information for the fabrication of amyloid fibril-prolamin protein composites, which may exhibit the combined advantages of each components and have potential applications in encapsulation and protection of bioactive substances and stabilizing emulsions.","Song, Jingru; Sun, Cuixia; Xiang, Yanwei; Xie, Yun; Mata, Analucia; Fang, Yapeng",Journal of agricultural and food chemistry,10,20

While the organic nature of the data offer new opportunities, the limited understanding of how and by whom the data are generated poses a challenge for advancing health-related research. Individual-level data linkage could shed light into the data generation mechanism. OBJECTIVES This paper investigates whether consent to link survey data with Twitter public data is associated with sociodemographic and Twitter use pattern factors and whether consenters and non-consenters differ on health-related outcomes. METHODS Data from three health related surveys that use probability samples of the target population were used: 1) A college population web survey in KU Leuven University, 2) An adult population web survey of the US population, and 3) A population face-to-face survey in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA). In all surveys, respondents reported whether they have a Twitter account, and Twitter users were asked to provide consent for linking their survey responses to their public Twitter data. RESULTS Consent rate estimates from the two web surveys in Belgium and the US were 24% and 27% respectively. The face-to-face survey in KSA yielded a higher consent rate of 45%. In general, respondents' sociodemographic characteristics were not significantly associated with consent to link. However, more use of social media and reporting sensitive information in the survey were found to be significantly correlated with higher consent. Consenters and non-consenters were not found to be statistically different on any of the health related measures. CONCLUSIONS Very few differences were found between those who consented to link their survey data with their Twitter public data and those who did not. Modifiable design variables need to be investigated to maximize consent while maintaining balance between consenters and non-consenters.","Mneimneh, Zeina N; McClain, Colleen; Bruffaerts, Ronny; Altwaijri, Yasmin A",Research in social & administrative pharmacy : RSAP,10,16

The implementation of bundles can yield superior results to the implementation of individual measures. The aim of this study was to address the effect of the application of a bundle including intraperitoneal lavage with antibiotic solution, fascial closure with Triclosan-coated sutures and Mupirocin ointment application on the skin staples, on the surgical site infection after elective laparoscopic colorectal cancer surgery. METHODS A prospective, randomized study was performed, including patients with diagnosis of colorectal neoplasms and plans to undergo an elective laparoscopic surgery. The patients were randomized into two groups: those patients following standard bundles (Group 1) and those ones following the experimental bundle with three additional measures, added to the standard bundle. Incisional and organ space SSI were investigated. The study was assessor-blinded. RESULTS A total of 198 patients were included in the study, 99 in each group. The incisional SSI rate was 16% in Group 1 and 2% in Group 2 [p = 0.007; RR = 5.6; CI 95% (1.4-17.8)]. The organ-space SSI rate was 4% in Group 1 and 0% in Group 2 [p = 0.039; RR = 1.7; CI 95% (1.1-11.6)]. Median hospital stay was 5.5 days in Group 1 and 4 days in Group 2 (p = 0.028). CONCLUSIONS The addition of intraperitoneal lavage with antibiotic solution, fascial closure with Triclosan-coated sutures and Mupirocin ointment application on the skin staples, to a standard bundle of SSI prevention, reduces the incisional and organ-space SSI and consequently the hospital stay, after elective laparoscopic colorectal cancer surgery (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03081962).","Ruiz-Tovar, Jaime; Llavero, Carolina; Morales, Vicente; Gamallo, Carlos",Surgical endoscopy,10,1

Interestingly, sociology, biology, and psychology have at different times in their history developed constructs of illness or sickness behavior. The aims of the present paper are to consider sickness behavior in animals and humans and to evaluate to what extent the notions of sickness behavior would allow for interdisciplinary research. After distinguishing disease, illness, and sickness, the case will be made that illness behavior and sickness behavior can be considered heuristically as synonyms given the existence of some fluidity between the notion of illness and sickness. Based on this, different faces, phases, and facets of sickness behavior will be presented before addressing the question of how integration of constructs of sickness behaviors would be possible across biology, medicine, psychology, and sociology. It is concluded that interdisciplinary research on sickness behavior between biology, psychology, and sociology is possible and called for with regard to constructs, methods, and explanations, while keeping in mind differences in perspectives, for example between acute and chronic sickness behavior.","Konsman, Jan Pieter",Frontiers in psychiatry,10,27

P. aeruginosa formed the most robust biofilm of conspicuous mushroom-like structure at 20°C. However, when the temperature increased to 25°C, the biofilm formation rapidly decreased. Above 25°C, as the temperature rose, the biofilm formation increased again little by little despite its less structured form, indicating that 25°C is the low point of biofilm formation. The intracellular c-di-GMP levels also decreased rapidly as the temperature rose from 20 to 25°C. The expression of pelA, algD, and pslA encoding Pel, alginate, and Psl, respectively, were also dramatically affected by temperature, in which pelA was regulated in a pattern such as a change in intracellular c-di-GMP levels and the regulation of algD was the most similar to the actual biofilm formation pattern. Total exopolysaccharide production was thermoregulated and followed the regulation pattern of c-di-GMP. Interestingly, the thermoregulation patterns in biofilm formation were different depending on the strain of P. aeruginosa Unlike PAO1, another strain PA14 showed a gradual decrease in biofilm formation and c-di-GMP in the range of 20 - 37°C and P. aeruginosa clinical isolates also showed slightly different patterns in biofilm formation with temperature change, suggesting that different strains may sense different temperature ranges for biofilm formation. However, it is obvious that P. aeruginosa forms more biofilms at lower temperatures and temperature is an important factor determining the biofilm formation.Importance Biofilm formation is an important protection mechanism used by most microorganisms and provides cells with many advantages like high infectivity, antibiotic resistance, and strong survivability. Since most persistent bacterial infections are believed to be associated with biofilms, the biofilm control is an important issue in medicine, environmental engineering, and industry. Biofilm formation is influenced by various environmental factors. Temperature is the most direct environmental cue encountered by microorganisms. Here we investigated the temperature effect on the biofilm formation of P. aeruginosa, a notorious pathogen, and found that temperature is an important factor determining the amount and structure of biofilm. Low temperature greatly increases the biofilm formation and gives it a highly conspicuous structure. Although the thermoregulation on biofilm formation is mainly mediated by c-di-GMP, some c-di-GMP-independent regulations were also observed. This study shows how biofilms are formed at various temperatures, and provides new insights to control biofilms using temperature.","Kim, Suran; Li, Xi-Hui; Hwang, Hyeon-Ji; Lee, Joon-Hee",Applied and environmental microbiology,10,1

Intercontinental trends in neurosurgeons' perception and practices of telemedicine have been sparingly reported. METHODOLOGY We conducted an online anonymized and validated survey using a structured questionnaire to get an insight into the neurosurgeons' experience with telemedicine across various continents and rated its usefulness on a 5-point Likert scale. RESULTS We received 286 responses across five continents. There was a trend to support a major paradigm shift favoring teleconsultations during this pandemic in respondents from North America (p=0.06). Signed prescriptions were emailed along with video-based teleconsultations preferentially in Europe and North America. In comparison, audio- or text-based teleconsults along with unsigned prescriptions were prevalent in Asia and Africa (p=0.0005). Acceptability and perceived usefulness for telemedicine during this pandemic was similar across the globe, irrespective of the neurosurgeons' experience (mean satisfaction score 3.72+/-1.09; p=0.62). Majority of neurosurgeons from Asia and South America complained of difficulties during teleconsultations owing to lack of appropriate infrastructure, internet connectivity/ prescription related issues, and potential risk of litigation (p=0.0005). Approximately 46% of neurosurgeons, especially from Europe and North America, felt that telemedicine could play a vital role in clinical practice even after the subsidence of this pandemic (mean satisfaction score 3.26+/-1.16; p=0.007).

METHODS We conducted a search of articles in the MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane CENTRAL, and Web of Science databases up to March 2020 for randomized controlled trials investigating HILT intervention, placebo, or active intervention as comparator groups for alleviating pain in knee osteoarthritis. Two independent reviewers evaluated the methodological quality and extracted pain and functional outcomes using a pre-specified form. A meta-analysis was performed using an inverse-variance random effect model. Heterogeneity was assessed using Higgins I2 with p-values. RESULTS Six randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were included in this meta-analysis. For VAS pain, 334 patients from four studies showed that HILT significantly decreased pain compared to the control (MD, -1.18; 95% CI, -1.68 to -0.69). HILT significantly improved WOMAC stiffness (SMD -1.00; 95% CI -1.32, -0.68) and function (SMD, -5.36; 95% CI -7.39 to -3.34) compared to the control. CONCLUSION The effectiveness of HILT on pain, stiffness, and function in patients with knee osteoarthritis is promising.

Data, including signalment, surgical time (from incision to completion of closure), size and location of port placement, need for conversion (both to standard multiport laparoscopy and laparotomy), as well as any intraoperative complications including blood loss or tissue injury were recorded. RESULTS Mean surgical time was 52.5 minutes (range, 45-60 minutes) and mean incision length, 1.8 cm (range, 1.5-2.0 cm). In an 18-kg mix breed dog (dog 3), a ""single port rescue"" was required and located on midline 2-cm caudal to the umbilicus. Close positioning of the trocars caused instrument interference, limited viewing, and prevented safe ligation of the ovarian vessels vein with a vessel-sealing device.

A 24-year-old female patient with a diagnosis of ITP received corticosteroid therapy. However, as the side effects became serious, a splenectomy option was chosen. The SILA splenectomy using a transumbilical approach is cosmetically more attractive than a conventional laparoscopic approach, but it has an increased risk of major bleeding due to technical considerations. Therefore, we prioritized the patient's safety during the SILA splenectomy by choosing a left lower abdominal approach. The operating time was 123 min and blood loss was 1 ml. This was comparable to a conventional laparoscopic splenectomy. The present case appears to be the first SILA splenectomy reported in Japan. In our experience, a SILA splenectomy is feasible and safe, with favorable perioperative and shortterm patient outcomes.

Many new agents have been developed in recent years, most with specific biological targets. This has mandated the need to look at different ways to streamline the evaluation of new agents. One solution has been the development of adaptive trial designs that allow the evaluation of multiple agents, concentrating on the most promising agents while screening out those which are unlikely to benefit patients. Another way forward has been the growth of partnerships between academia and industry with the shared goal of designing and conducting high quality clinical trials which answer important clinical questions as efficiently as possible. The RAMPART trial (NCT03288532) brings together both of these processes in an attempt to improve outcomes for patients with locally advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC), where no globally acceptable adjuvant strategy after nephrectomy currently exist.

Amino acid substitutions in the B.1.1.7 protein increase the accessibility of its receptor binding domain and also the binding affinity for receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). The enhanced receptor engagement may account for the increased transmissibility. The B.1.351 variant has evolved to reshape antigenic surfaces of the major neutralizing sites on the S protein, making it resistant to some potent neutralizing antibodies.

We used tyramide signal amplification (TSA) and label-free mass spectrometry (MS) to compare proteins in nuclear speckles versus centromeres. Our ""TSA-MS ratio"" approach successfully identified known nuclear speckle proteins. For example, 96% and 67% of proteins in the top 30 and 100 sorted proteins, respectively, are known nuclear speckle proteins, including proteins that we validated here as enriched in nuclear speckles. We show that MFAP1, among the top 20 in our list, forms droplets under certain circumstances and that MFAP1 expression levels modulate the size, stability, and dynamics of nuclear speckles. Localization of MFAP1 and its binding partner, PRPF38A, in droplet-like nuclear bodies precedes formation of nuclear speckles during telophase. Our results update older proteomic studies of nuclear speckles and should provide a useful reference dataset to guide future experimental dissection of nuclear speckle structure and function.","Dopie, Joseph; Sweredoski, Michael J; Moradian, Annie; Belmont, Andrew S",The Journal of cell biology,10,24

METHODS The development of a PBRS started around 1993 aiming to provide an effective tool for patient registration, tracking, and tracing during major incidents. The PBRS uses wristbands with barcodes to follow and register patients in the care process. During a large trauma drill, 120 patients and 40 relatives were registered and traced in the system. Errors in registration, tracking, and tracing of persons were registered. RESULTS Of the 120 patients, no patient data were lost and patients could be traced in real time throughout the treatment process by the command team. Strategic decisions could be made based on the information provided by the system. Patient relatives were easily matched and government agencies received regular updates on the number and characteristics of the patients. CONCLUSION The PBRS is a usable, feasible, and sustainable patient tracking and tracing tool to be used during the hospital response to major incidents. Lessons learned during the last 20 years include the need for continuous updates to withstand the challenge of time.

This study was undertaken to evaluate the role of proteases in these alterations by subjecting rat hearts to different times of global ischemia, as well as reperfusion after 45 min of ischemia. Decreases in Na(+)-K(+)-ATPase activity at 30-60 min of global ischemia were accompanied by augmented activities of both calpain and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and depressed protein content of β(1)- and β(2)-subunits, without changes in α(1)- and α(2)-subunits of the enzyme. Compared with control values, the activities of both calpain and MMP-2 were increased, whereas the activity and protein content for all subunits of Na(+)-K(+)-ATPase were decreased upon reperfusion for 5-40 min, except that α(1)- and α(2)-subunit content was not depressed in 5 min I/R hearts. MDL28170, a calpain inhibitor, was more effective in attenuating the I/R-induced alterations in cardiac contracture, Na(+)-K(+)-ATPase activity, and α(2)-subunit than doxycycline, an MMP inhibitor. Incubation of control sarcolemma preparation with calpain, unlike MMP-2, depressed Na(+)-K(+)-ATPase activity and decreased α(1)-, α(2)-, and β(2)-subunits, without changes in the β(1)-subunit. These results support the view that activation of both calpain and MMP-2 are involved in depressing Na(+)-K(+)-ATPase activity and degradation of its subunits directly or indirectly in hearts subjected to I/R injury.","Müller, Alison L; Freed, Darren; Dhalla, Naranjan S",Journal of applied physiology,10,16

METHODS This retrospective analysis was conducted based on the data of 119 cases from the Department of Fever and the Department of Infection undergoing chest high-resolution CT examinations in Sanshui District People's Hospital between January, 24 and February 10, 2020. The cases with no abnormality on chest CT were excluded. Twenty-three patients were diagnosed to have pneumonia, including 9 with SARS-CoV-2-associated pneumonia and 14 with other types of pneumonia. We comparatively analyzed the CT signs, location of the lesions and the dandelion clock-like sign among different types of pneumonia. RESULTS Among the 23 patients with pneumonia, 9 (39.1%) had common or severe SARS-CoV-2- associated pneumonia with a positive epidemiological history and corresponding respiratory symptoms. Seven of the SARSCoV-2-associated pneumonia patients had multiple lesions in bilateral lungs, compromising mainly the lung field and the subpleural area and showing patchy, lumpy, and umbrella-shaped ground glass opacity, often accompanied by pulmonary vascular thickening and increased microvessels, interlobular septal thickening and fibrosis and lined with grid-like and small-bubble-like ""crazy-paving"" patterns. The dandelion clock-like sign was found in all the 9 patients with SARSCoV-2-associated pneumonia, with a total of 46 lesions (60.5%, 76 total lesions); 9 of the lesions presented with a ""dandelion clek-like"" sign and 37 with a ""dandelion seed sign"". These signs were not found in the 14 patients with other types of pneumonia. CONCLUSIONS The dandelion clock-like sign is a common and characteristic chest CT finding in patients with SARS-CoV-2-associated pneumonia, and can help to distinguish SARS-CoV-2-associated pneumonia from other types of pneumonia.","Fu, Xiaobin; Li, Jiesheng; Huang, Zhou; Xu, Zhiming; Yao, Weiping; Cui, Yunneng; Ouyang, Kexun; Liu, Huaizhong",Nan fang yi ke da xue xue bao = Journal of Southern Medical University,10,27

The separate reconstruction of two images is achieved by applying Monte Carlo simulation-based corrections for self-scatter and cross-talk between energy windows. For method evaluation, a series of (99m)Tc/(111)In physical phantom experiments was performed using a clinical SPECT/CT camera. The containers were filled with different ratios of (99m)Tc and (111)In activities to create cross-talk with varying severity levels. In addition, we illustrate the performance of our method by reconstructing images from four simultaneous (99m)Tc/(111)In SPECT/CT studies of neuroendocrine patients. Similarly to the phantom experiments, clinical cases provide examples with different severity of cross-talk. Phantom experiments showed that Monte Carlo simulation-based corrections improved both quantitative accuracy and visual properties of (99m)Tc and (111)In images. While the errors of absolute activities for both tracers in six containers ranged from 16% to 75% if no corrections for self-scatter and cross-talk were applied, these errors decreased to below 10% when images were reconstructed with the aforementioned corrections. These activities were measured using regions of interest larger than the true sizes of the containers in order to account for the spill-out effect. Analysis of patient studies confirmed that accurate simulation-based compensations improved resolution and contrast for both (99m)Tc and (111)In images.","Shcherbinin, S; Chamoiseau, S; Celler, A",Physics in medicine and biology,10,1

To contribute to future COVID-19 countermeasures, we aimed at verifying the results of countermeasures achieved by public health centers (PHCs) against the first wave of COVID-19 in Yamagata Prefecture, Japan. During January-May 2020, 1,253 patients suspected of SARS-CoV-2 infection were invited for testing. Simultaneously, based on retrospective contact tracings, PHCs investigated the infection sources and transmission routes of laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases and tested 928 contacts. Consequently, 69 cases were confirmed during March 31 - May 4, 58 (84.1%; 95% confidence interval 75.5-92.7) of whom were found from contacts. The spread of infection was triggered by cases harboring epidemiological links outside of Yamagata. Then, the number of cases increased rapidly. However, PHCs identified epidemiological links in 61 (88.4%; 95% confidence interval 80.8-96.0) of the 69 cases and transmission chains up to the fifth generation. Finally, the spread of infection ended after approximately one month. Our results indicate that the identification of infection sources and active case finding from contacts based on retrospective contact tracing was likely to be an effective strategy to end the first wave of COVID-19 in Yamagata.","Seto, Junji; Aoki, Yoko; Komabayashi, Kenichi; Ikeda, Yoko; Sampei, Mika; Ogawa, Naomi; Uchiumi, Yumiko; Fujii, Shunji; Chiba, Masami; Suzuki, Emiko; Takahashi, Tatsuya; Yamada, Keiko; Otani, Yoshiko; Ashino, Yoshihiro; Araki, Kyoko; Kato, Takeo; Ishikawa, Hitoshi; Ikeda, Tatsuya; Abe, Hideaki; Ahiko, Tadayuki; Mizuta, Katsumi",Japanese journal of infectious diseases,10,1

Ongoing surveillance and characterisation of Australian IBVs have shown that they have evolved separately from strains found throughout the rest of the world, resulting in the evolution of a range of unique strains and changes in the dominant wild type strains, affecting tissue tropism, pathogenicity, antigenicity, and gene arrangement. Between 1961 and 1976 highly nephropathogenic genotype GI-5 and GI-6 strains, causing mortalities of 40% to 100%, predominated, while strains causing mainly respiratory disease, with lower mortality rates have predominated since then. Since 1988 viruses belonging to two distinct and novel genotypes, GIII and GV, have been detected. The genome organisation of the GIII strains has not been seen in any other gammacoronavirus. Mutations that emerged soon after the introduction of vaccination, incursion of strains with a novel lineage from unknown sources, recombination between IBVs from different genetic lineages, and gene translocations and deletions have contributed to an increasingly complex IBV population. These processes and the consequences of this variation for the biology of these viruses provide an insight into the evolution of endemic coronaviruses during their control by vaccination and may provide a better understanding of the potential for evolution of other coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2. Furthermore, the continuing capacity of attenuated IBV vaccines developed over 40 years ago to provide protection against viruses in the same genetic lineage provides some assurance that coronavirus vaccines developed to control other coronaviruses may continue to be effective for an extended period.","Quinteros, José A; Ignjatovic, Jagoda; Chousalkar, Kapil K; Noormohammadi, Amir H; Browning, Glenn F",Avian pathology : journal of the W.V.P.A,10,1

METHODS A retrospective review was conducted on a prospectively collected institutional review board-approved database of nipple-sparing mastectomy cases with immediate device-based reconstruction performed between July of 2006 and October of 2012. Malposition was graded as mild (1 cm), moderate (2 cm), or severe (>3 cm) displacement. RESULTS Three hundred nineteen nipple-sparing mastectomies were reviewed. Malposition occurred in 44 (13.79 percent). Significant factors were age (p < 0.0001), diabetes mellitus (p = 0.0025), body mass index (p = 0.0093), preoperative sternal notch-to-nipple distance (p = 0.015), preoperative breast base width (p = 0.0001), periareolar mastectomy incision with lateral extension (p < 0.0001), prior radiation (p = 0.0004), prior lumpectomy (p = 0.0125), unilateral nipple-sparing mastectomy (p = 0.0004), and postoperative nipple-areola complex ischemia (p = 0.0174). Smoking status, breast volume resected, implant size, ablative surgeon, acellular dermal matrix, and single-stage reconstruction were not significant. Nineteen patients were satisfied. Eight were not offered surgical correction because of an inadequate skin envelope. Eight had crescent mastopexy, three had implant exchange and pocket revision, four had free nipple grafts, and two had pedicled nipple transposition. There were no incidences of necrosis or malposition after surgical correction.

Additional surrounding x-ray beam on time, or padding, can be variably set, and the increased padding results in additional available phases for analysis. The purpose of this study was to assess the effect of padding duration on image interpretability and its incident effect on radiation dose. SUBJECTS AND METHODS We prospectively evaluated imaging of 886 patients undergoing consecutive prospectively ECG-triggered coronary CT angiographic examinations at three centers and compared the findings in patients stratified by padding duration. We assessed the effect of padding duration on image interpretability and radiation dose. RESULTS The mean patient age was 56 +/- 12 years, and 58% of the patients were men. The median heart rate was 55 beats/min (interquartile range, 50-61 beats/min). Padding duration was 0, 1-99, and 100-150 milliseconds for 268, 482, and 136 patients, respectively, with no difference in image interpretability rate between groups (per patient, 98.8%, 97.3%, and 97.1%; per artery, 99.2%, 99.2%, and 99.1%). The groups differed in median radiation dose (2.3 mSv [interquartile range, 1.5-3.2 mSv]; 3.8 mSv [interquartile range, 2.3-4.7 mSv]; 5.5 mSv [interquartile range, 3.8-6.1 mSv]; p < 0.001). Independent of patient and scan parameters, increased padding was associated with greater radiation dose (45% increase per 100-millisecond increase in padding, p < 0.001). CONCLUSION In a large multicenter study of coronary CT angiography of patients with excellent heart rate control, the use of minimal padding was associated with a substantial reduction in radiation dose with preserved image interpretability. Use of no or reduced padding should be considered in dose-reduction strategies.","Labounty, Troy M; Leipsic, Jonathon; Min, James K; Heilbron, Brett; Mancini, G B John; Lin, Fay Y; Earls, James P",AJR.

In the setting of intraprocedural or periprocedural embolism, thrombolytics present a potentially useful therapeutic strategy. A series of patients in whom eptifibatide (a platelet glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptor inhibitor) was used in the treatment of iatrogenic thromboembolic events occurring during elective neuroendovascular procedures is described. METHODS Consecutive cases between May 2009 and July 2011 in which eptifibatide was administered were identified and individually reviewed for inclusion in this study (n=12). All study patients received a uniform, weight based bolus dose of 180 μg/kg of eptifibatide administered either intra-arterially through the guide catheter or intravenously. Eptifibatide infusion (2 μg/kg/min) for 24 h after bolus dose administration was continued at the discretion of the surgeon. Procedural details are described and illustrative cases presented. RESULTS Three major categories of thromboembolic events were isolated in the course of review of study cases: acute focal neurological decline and no radiographic findings of flow limitation (eight patients), radiographic findings with or without symptoms (two patients) and persistent particulate debris during flow reversal as part of a carotid revascularization procedure (two patients). Following eptifibatide administration, no patient experienced hemorrhagic complications, and neurologic improvement to baseline level was noted in 10 of 12 patients. CONCLUSION Eptifibatide may be an effective therapeutic strategy in the event of thromboembolism during elective neuroendovascular procedures.","Dumont, Travis M; Kan, Peter; Snyder, Kenneth V; Hopkins, L Nelson; Siddiqui, Adnan H; Levy, Elad I",Journal of neurointerventional surgery,10,13

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention emphasize improved basic preventive measures to reduce bacterial transmission and infections among patients undergoing surgery. Objective To assess whether improved basic preventive measures can reduce perioperative Staphylococcus aureus transmission and surgical site infections. Design, Setting, and Participants This randomized clinical trial was conducted from September 20, 2018, to September 20, 2019, among 19 surgeons and their 236 associated patients at a major academic medical center with a 60-day follow-up period. Participants were a random sample of adult patients undergoing orthopedic total joint, orthopedic spine, oncologic gynecological, thoracic, general, colorectal, open vascular, plastic, or open urological surgery requiring general or regional anesthesia. Surgeons and their associated patients were randomized 1:1 via a random number generator to treatment group or to usual care. Observers were masked to patient groupings during assessment of outcome measures. Interventions Sustained improvements in perioperative hand hygiene, vascular care, environmental cleaning, and patient decolonization efforts. Main Outcomes and Measures Perioperative S aureus transmission assessed by the number of isolates transmitted and the incidence of transmission among patient care units (primary) and the incidence of surgical site infections (secondary). Results Of 236 patients (156 [66.1%] women; mean [SD] age, 57 [15] years), 106 (44.9%) and 130 (55.1%) were allocated to the treatment and control groups, respectively, received the intended treatment, and were analyzed for the primary outcome. Compared with the control group, the treatment group had a reduced mean (SD) number of transmitted perioperative S aureus isolates (1.25 [2.11] vs 0.47 [1.13]; P = .002). Treatment reduced the incidence of S aureus transmission (incidence risk ratio; 0.56; 95% CI, 0.37-0.86; P = .008; with robust variance clustering by surgeon: 95% CI, 0.42-0.76; P < .001). Overall, 11 patients (4.7%) experienced surgical site infections, 10 (7.7%) in the control group and 1 (0.9%) in the treatment group. Transmission was associated with an increased risk of surgical site infection (8 of 73 patients [11.0%] with transmission vs 3 of 163 [1.8%] without; risk ratio, 5.95; 95% CI, 1.62-21.86; P = .007). Treatment reduced the risk of surgical site infection (hazard ratio, 0.12; 95% CI, 0.02-0.92; P = .04; with clustering by surgeon: 95% CI, 0.03-0.51; P = .004). Conclusions and Relevance Improved basic preventive measures in the perioperative arena can reduce S aureus transmission and surgical site infections.

One of the potential risks of joint replacement is metallosis, or the local and systemic release of metal ions. Metallosis is caused by the release of metallic debris, secondary to hardware failure. The phenomenon is most commonly associated with failed metal-on-metal hip prostheses and is characterized locally by heavy staining of surrounding soft tissue, metallic synovitis, joint effusion, and gradual loosening of the prosthesis. Additionally, metallic debris can also lead to periarticular superficial skin manifestations. The release of metal ions has further been known to lead to systemic upsets including neurologic deficit (declining vision, hearing, or cognition; headaches), cardiac failure, and hypothyroidism. As the number of patients seeking major orthopedic interventions grows, the incidence of metallosis-related skin tattooing will also increase. The structural components of a failed joint replacement can be revised (improving patients' pain and functioning). However, any skin tattooing secondary to metallosis presents the treating dermatologist with clinical challenge, due to lack of research regarding treatment of this condition. Our aim is to review the published literature on metallosis, including the pathophysiology.

In this study, nanoscale hydrophilic colloidal co-assemblies (80 ~ 150 nm) with excellent water solubility were prepared by hydrating RPs and CPs at pH 12 combined with neutralization. The solubility of RPs was boosted to over 90% (w/v), while most of the subunits in CPs became fully soluble. Structural analysis revealed that RPs and CPs non-covalently reacted, which triggered sheet-helix transitions and formed a compact core of RPs coated by a layer of CPs. Both proteins exposed significant hydrophilic motifs and buried hydrophobic moieties, contributing to the high water-dispersibility of their co-assemblies. Moreover, the co-assembled proteins acquired leveraged amino acid compositions between RPs and CPs. This study will enrich the processing technology of protein components, customizing their structural and nutritional characteristics.","Wang, Ren; Wang, Tingting; Feng, Wei; Wang, Qichu; Wang, Tao",Food chemistry,10,26

The purpose of this study was to estimate the extent to which adding a novel bench-top component improves learning of SAGES' Fundamental Use of Surgical Energy™ (FUSE) electrosurgery curriculum among surgical trainees. METHODS Surgical residents participated in a 1-h didactic electrosurgery (ES) course, based on the FUSE curriculum. They were then randomized to one of two groups: an unstructured hands-on session where trainees used ES devices (control group) or a goal-directed hands-on training session (Sim group). Pre- and post-curriculum (immediate and at 3 months) assessments included knowledge of ES (multiple-choice examination), self-perceived competence for each of the 35 course objectives (questionnaire), and self-perceived comfort with performance of seven tasks related to safe use of ES. Data expressed as median[interquartile range], *p < 0.05. RESULTS 56 (29 control; 27 Sim) surgical trainees completed the curriculum and assessments. Baseline characteristics, including pre-curriculum exam and questionnaire scores, were similar. Total score on the exam improved from 46%[40;54] to 84%[77;91]* for the entire cohort, with higher immediate post-curriculum scores in the Sim group compared to controls (89%[83;94] vs. 83%[71;86]*). At 3 months, performance on the exam declined in both groups, but remained higher in the Sim group (77%[69;90] vs 60%[51;80]*). Participants in both groups reported feeling greater comfort and competence post-curriculum (immediate and at 3 months) compared to baseline. This improvement was greater in the Sim group with a higher proportion feeling ""Very Comfortable"" or ""Fully Competent"" (Sim: 3/7 tasks and 28/35 objectives; control: 0/7 tasks and 10/35 objectives). CONCLUSIONS A FUSE-based curriculum improved surgical trainees' knowledge and comfort in the safe use of electrosurgical devices. The addition of a structured interactive bench-top simulation component further improved learning and retention at 3 months.","Madani, Amin; Watanabe, Yusuke; Vassiliou, Melina C; Fuchshuber, Pascal; Jones, Daniel B; Schwaitzberg, Steven D; Fried, Gerald M; Feldman, Liane S",Surgical endoscopy,10,16

Maternal malnutrition is a risk factor for maternal, fetal, and neonatal complications and is more prevalent in low and middle-income countries (LMICs). This review aims to study the effectiveness of antenatal macronutrient nutritional interventions on maternal, neonatal, and child outcomes. We searched the CENTRAL, PubMed, Embase, and other databases for randomized controlled trials and quasi-experimental designs on healthy pregnant women in LMICs. We also searched grey literature and reports from Google Scholar, Web of Science, and websites of different organizations. Title/abstract screening, full-text screening, and data extraction filtered 15 studies for inclusion. Balanced energy protein (BEP) supplementation (n = 8) studies showed a reduced incidence of perinatal mortality, stillbirths, low birth weight (LBW) infants, small for gestational age (SGA) babies and increased birth weight. Food distribution programs (FDPs) (n =5) witnessed reduced rates of SGA, stunting, wasting, and increased birth weight and birth length. Studies on intervention for obesity prevention (n = 2) showed reductions in birth weight. Other findings were statistically insignificant. Subgroup analyses were conducted to study the effectiveness of supplementation between regions, location, the timing of supplementation and nutritional status; however, there were a limited number of studies in each subgroup. Data from our review supports the antenatal supplementation of BEP and FDP for the prevention of adverse maternal, neonatal, and child outcomes that can be utilized for future policymaking. However, more research is required before recommending obesity prevention programs.","Lassi, Zohra S; Padhani, Zahra A; Rabbani, Amna; Rind, Fahad; Salam, Rehana A; Das, Jai K; Bhutta, Zulfiqar A",Nutrients,10,1

Meanwhile, ambulatory surgery has been developed and implemented with the aims of improving patient satisfaction and reducing health care costs. The objective of this study was to report our preliminary experience with ambulatory minimally invasive LHS. METHODS Between 1999 and 2014, 172 patients underwent LHS at our institution, including 151 liver resections and 21 fenestrations of hepatic cysts. The consecutive series of highly selected patients who underwent ambulatory LHS were included in this study. RESULTS Twenty patients underwent ambulatory LHS. Indications were liver cysts in 10 cases, liver angioma in 3 cases, focal nodular hyperplasia in 3 cases, and colorectal hepatic metastasis in 4 cases. The median operative time was 92 minutes (range: 50-240 minutes). The median blood loss was 35 mL (range: 20-150 mL). There were no postoperative complications or re-hospitalizations. All patients were hospitalized after surgery in our ambulatory surgery unit, and were discharged 5-7 hours after surgery. The median postoperative pain score at the time of discharge was 3 (visual analogue scale: 0-10; range: 0-4). The median quality-of-life score at the first postoperative visit was 8 (range: 6-10) and the median cosmetic satisfaction score was 8 (range: 7-10). CONCLUSION This series shows that, in selected patients, ambulatory LHS is feasible and safe for minor hepatic procedures.","Gaillard, M; Tranchart, H; Lainas, P; Tzanis, D; Franco, D; Dagher, I",Journal of visceral surgery,10,26

Study Design This is a retrospective nonrandomized study. Study Setting Conducted at the University of California Davis Medical Center, Sacramento, California. Patients A total of 31 patients, ranging from 24 to 83 years of age, with a mean age of 61 years (22 men, 9 women) with head and neck cancer (26 patients), malignant glomus tumor (1 patient) or giant carotid aneurysms (4 patients) as possible candidates for surgical carotid artery sacrifice were evaluated from September 2005 to September 2012. Methods All patients underwent unilateral internal carotid artery balloon test occlusion with SPECT analysis (20 mCi technetium 99m-hexamethyl propyleneamine oxime [HMPAO]) imaging before and during carotid occlusion. Carotid angiography with carotid cross-compression (manual compression of the cervical artery contralateral to the side of contrast injection) was used to analyze filling through the anterior communicating artery to the contralateral hemisphere. Intervention The balloon occlusion was terminated in two patients because of deterioration of the neurologic exam. Main Outcome Measures All patients who passed the neurologic examination during BTO and also passed the SPECT occlusive study underwent successful carotid sacrifice without neurologic sequelae. Patients failing the occlusive neurologic examination and/or the SPECT study elected chemoradiation, with the exception of one patient who underwent a successful carotid bypass graft and carotid resection. Results The success of carotid sacrifice in patients passing both the occlusive test and the SPECT analysis for carotid sacrifice was 100%. Three patients failed both the BTO and the SPECT, with two demonstrating no anterior circulation cross-fill, but one showed some cross-fill. Six additional patients passed the BTO but failed the SPECT, with poor cross-fill in five patients. In addition, three patients who had excellent cross-fill through the anterior communicating artery to the contralateral hemisphere failed the SPECT examination in two cases and failed both tests in another case.","Tansavatdi, Katharine; Dublin, Arthur B; Donald, Paul J; Dahlin, Brian","Journal of neurological surgery.

This is especially important for protection against viruses that enter the host through the respiratory tract. We show that targeting the OX40 costimulatory receptor (CD134) strongly promotes mucosal memory in the CD8 T cell compartment. Systemic injection of an agonist antibody to OX40 strongly enhanced development of polyfunctional effector CD8 T cells that were induced after intraperitoneal infection with a highly virulent strain of vaccinia virus. These cells were located in lymphoid organs and also the lung, and importantly, long-term memory CD8 T cells were maintained in the lung over 1 year. Anti-OX40 also boosted memory development when mice were vaccinated subcutaneously with viral peptide. These CD8 T cells were sufficient to provide protection from lethal respiratory infection with live vaccinia virus independent of CD4 T cells and antibody. Again, the CD8 T cell populations that were induced after secondary infection displayed polyfunctionality and were maintained in the lung for over a year. These data suggest that agonists to the OX40 costimulatory receptor represent potential candidates for incorporation into vaccines for respiratory viruses.","Salek-Ardakani, Shahram; Moutaftsi, Magdalini; Sette, Alessandro; Croft, Michael",Journal of virology,10,1

Although various treatment strategies have resulted in marked improvement in vasculitis-specific outcomes, many patients with AAV continue to suffer from complications related to the prolonged use of glucocorticoids (GC) such as infections, metabolic abnormalities, and increased cardiovascular morbidity. Recently, activation of the alternative complement pathway has been implicated in the augmentation of the damage caused by AAV via the complement C5a receptor (C5AR1, CD88). Specifically targeting this pathway may lead to improved outcomes in patients with AAV. AREAS COVERED In this article, we have summarized the rationale for targeting the complement pathway in AAV. The relevant pre-clinical, phase I, II and III findings with emphasis on the efficacy, and safety of avacopan, a new oral competitive inhibitor that interferes with the binding of C5a to C5aR1 (CD88), are reviewed. EXPERT OPINION These results are encouraging, may led to major changes in the treatment approach for AAV, and give rise to future studies utilizing complement inhibitors in AAV patients, and potentially in other immune mediated diseases.","Osman, Mohammed; Cohen Tervaert, Jan Willem; Pagnoux, Christian",Expert review of clinical immunology,10,2

METHODS A total of 1326 laparoscopic varicocelectomy cases performed by 16 participants from July 2005 to June 2012 were retrospectively analyzed. The participants were divided into 2 groups: group A was trained by laparoscopic trainer boxes; group B was trained by a virtual reality training course preoperatively. The operation time curves were drafted, and the learning, improving, and platform stages were divided and statistically confirmed. The operation time and number of cases in the learning and improving stages of both groups were compared. Testicular artery sparing failure and postoperative hydroceles rate were statistically analyzed for the confirmation of the learning curve. RESULTS The learning curve of laparoscopic varicocelectomy was 15 cases, and with 14 cases more, it came into the platform stage. The number of cases for the learning stages of both groups showed no statistical difference (P=.49), but the operation time of group B for the learning stage was less than that of group A (P<.00001). The number of cases of group B for the improving stage was significantly less than that of group A (P=.005), but the operation time of both groups in the improving stage showed no difference (P=.30). The difference of testicular artery sparing failure rates among these 3 stages was proved significant (P<.0001), the postoperative hydroceles rate showed no statistical difference (P=.60). CONCLUSIONS The virtual reality training shortened the operation time in the learning stage and hastened the trainees' steps in the improving stage, but did not shorten the learning curve as expected to.","Wang, Zheng; Ni, Yuhua; Zhang, Yinan; Jin, Xunbo; Xia, Qinghua; Wang, Hanbo",JSLS : Journal of the Society of Laparoendoscopic Surgeons,10,1

Recent studies have demonstrated that lncRNAs play essential roles in tumorigenesis, and are involved in cell proliferation, apoptosis, migration and invasion in several types of tumor, including lung cancer. However, the clinical relevance of lncRNA expression in lung cancer remains unknown. The aim of the present study was to investigate the expression pattern of RFPL3 antisense (RFPL3S) and its associations with clinicopathological characteristics in patients with lung cancer. Whether RFPL3S can act as a potential prognostic biomarker for lung cancer was also investigated. RFPL3S expression in tumor samples and cells was assessed using the Oncomine database and the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia, respectively. Based on Kaplan-Meier Plotter analyses, the prognostic values of RFPL3S were further evaluated. It was revealed that RFPL3S was highly expressed in lung cancer tissues when compared with normal tissues and was significantly associated with pN factor, pTNM stage and Ki-67 labeling index. In the survival analyses, increased RFPL3S expression was associated with poor survival and was inversely associated with first progression in all patients. These results indicate that RFPL3S may be of clinical significance and may act as a prognostic biomarker in lung cancer.","Liu, Zhonghua; Ning, Zhiqiang; Lu, Hailin; Cao, Tinghua; Zhou, Feng; Ye, Xia; Chen, Chao",Oncology letters,10,17

This review evaluates the factors leading to the rise of vaping, reasons for its striking popularity among US teens, health consequences of vaping, and measures to mitigate the vaping epidemic. RECENT FINDINGS Contemporary research highlights the continued rise of vaping amongst US teens and explains the reasons for its popularity, such as the variety of devices, a wide range of available flavors, youth-targeted advertisements, and lack of awareness of adverse consequences from vaping. This publication highlights current research findings of health consequences of vaping, including a discussion of EVALI (e-cigarette or vaping product use-associated lung injury) and provides an update on strategies to curtail the vaping epidemic. SUMMARY Vaping has risen to epidemic proportions amongst US teens. This poses a clear and present danger to teens' health with adverse effects ranging from acute lung injury to long-term addiction. This article summarizes key research findings that explain the reasons for the epidemic, health consequences of vaping, and provides an overview of efforts to mitigate the vaping threat to US teens.","Venkata, Anand N; Palagiri, Raga Deepak R; Vaithilingam, Siddharthan",Current opinion in pulmonary medicine,10,16

In this prospective non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cohort, longitudinal TE risk profiling (clinical and biomarker) was undertaken to develop risk stratification models for targeted TE prevention. These were compared with published models from Khorana, CATS, PROTECHT, CONKO, and CATS/MICA. The NSCLC cohort of 129 patients, median follow-up 22.0 months (range 5.6-31.3), demonstrated a hypercoagulable profile in >75% patients and TE incidence of 19%. High TE risk patients were those receiving chemotherapy with baseline fibrinogen ≥ 4 g/L and d-dimer ≥ 0.5 mg/L; or baseline d-dimer ≥ 1.5 mg/L; or month 1 d-dimer ≥ 1.5 mg/L. The model predicted TE with 100% sensitivity and 34% specificity (c-index 0.67), with TE incidence 27% vs. 0% for high vs. low-risk. A comparison using the Khorana, PROTECHT, and CONKO methods were not discriminatory; TE incidence 17⁻25% vs. 14⁻19% for high vs. low-risk (c-index 0.51⁻0.59). Continuous d-dimer (CATS/MICA model) was also not predictive of TE. Independent of tumour stage, high TE risk was associated with cancer progression (HR 1.9, p = 0.01) and mortality (HR 2.2, p = 0.02). The model was tested for scalability in a prospective gastrointestinal cancer cohort with equipotency demonstrated; 80% sensitivity and 39% specificity. This proposed TE risk prediction model is simple, practical, potent and can be used in the clinic for real-time, decision-making for targeted thromboprophylaxis. Validation in a multicentre randomised interventional study is underway (ACTRN12618000811202).","Alexander, Marliese; Ball, David; Solomon, Benjamin; MacManus, Michael; Manser, Renee; Riedel, Bernhard; Westerman, David; Evans, Sue M; Wolfe, Rory; Burbury, Kate",Cancers,10,31

It is important to detect malreductions because they may lead to impaired functional outcome and may demand reoperations. The aim of this study was to systematically review the literature to evaluate the appropriateness of different image techniques in determining syndesmotic malalignment. A literature search was conducted in Medline, Embase, and the Cochrane Library to search for articles assessing syndesmotic reduction. Excluded were articles where no criteria and/or measurements for syndesmotic reduction were provided, only normative values were provided and reviews. In total, 2157 articles were found, of which 1421 studies were screened for title and abstract after exclusion of duplicates. One hundred ten studies were eligible for full-text analysis. Of these, 61 were excluded. Three studies where added after screening the included references. Fifty-two studies were included, of which 32 were original publications and 20 were publications referring to the original publications. From the original publications, 14 used plains radiographs, 19 computed tomographic (CT) scans, and 5 used 3-dimensional CT scans (some authors used >1 modality in their study). For each modality, a large number of parameters and different cutoff values were reported. CT scanning is superior to plain radiography in the assessment of the quality of joint reduction. Parameters used the most were fibular position in the incisura and fibular rotation. The criteria for adequate reduction should at least include the position of the fibula in the incisura and rotation of the fibula, while ensuring adequate fibular length, all equaling or at least approaching the values of the uninjured contralateral side.","van den Heuvel, Stein B; Dingemans, Siem A; Gardenbroek, Tjibbe J; Schepers, Tim",The Journal of foot and ankle surgery : official publication of the American College of Foot and Ankle Surgeons,10,1

Although it has been acknowledged that target organ damage involves an inflammatory response, most work has focused on the role of macrophages, but T lymphocytes have recently become the center of interest. The goal of our study was to evaluate the role of T-cell-specific cytokines in the pathogenesis of EH. The study examined 39 patients with EH (57.7±6.8 years, systolic blood pressure (SBP) 157.5±11.8 mm Hg, diastolic blood pressure 92.2±12.9 mm Hg, mean arterial pressure 113.9±12.6 mm Hg) and 30 healthy, normotensive controls (55.2±4.9 years). Blood was drawn from a peripheral vein, and serum levels of interferon-inducible protein (IP)-10 and interleukins (IL)-4, -7 and -13 were measured by a multiplexing assay. Hypertensive patients had significantly higher levels of IP-10, IL-4, IL-7 and IL-13 than control subjects. When the patients were classified into tertiles according to their serum IP-10 levels (T1: 41.2-94.1 pg ml(-1); T2: 103.4-162.5 pg ml(-1); T3: 171.7-443.5 pgml(-1)), the patients classified into the highest tertile also had the highest blood pressure. In a correlation analysis, plasma IP-10 concentration was significantly associated with SBP (r=0.59, P<0.001). Furthermore, hypertensives with microalbuminuria, an early sign of hypertensive target organ damage, had the highest IP-10 levels. A stepwise multivariate regression analysis revealed IP-10 as the strongest independent predictor of SBP (P=0.01). In conclusion, our study provides new insights into the pathophysiological mechanisms in EH linking inflammation and IP-10. However, these preliminary results need to be confirmed in larger trials.","Stumpf, Christian; Auer, Christoph; Yilmaz, Atilla; Lewczuk, Piotr; Klinghammer, Lutz; Schneider, Markus; Daniel, Werner G; Schmieder, Roland E; Garlichs, Christoph D",Hypertension research : official journal of the Japanese Society of Hypertension,10,1

Our understanding of pathophysiology recognizes the role of inflammation, oxidative and endoplasm reticulum stress, and angiogenic dysfunction. Yet, we have not progressed greatly toward clinically useful prediction nor had substantial success in prevention or treatment. One possibility is that the maternal syndrome may be reached through different pathophysiological pathways, that is, subtypes of preeclampsia, that in their specificity yield more clinical utility. For example, early and late onset preeclampsia are increasingly acknowledged as different pathophysiological processes leading to a common presentation. Other subtypes of preeclampsia are supported by disparate clinical outcomes, long-range prognosis, organ systems involved, and risk factors. These insights have been supplemented by discovery-driven methods, which cluster preeclampsia cases into groups indicating different pathophysiologies. In this presentation, we review likely subtypes based on current knowledge and suggest others. We present a consideration of the requirements for a clinically meaningful preeclampsia subtype. A useful subtype should (1) identify a specific pathophysiological pathway or (2) specifically indicate maternal or fetal outcome, (3) be recognizable in a clinically useful time frame, and (4) these results should be reproducible and generalizable (but at varying frequency) including in low resource settings. We recommend that the default consideration be that preeclampsia includes several subtypes rather than trying to force all cases into a single pathophysiological pathway. The recognition of subtypes and deciphering their different pathophysiologies will provide specific targets for prevention, prediction, and treatment directing personalized care.","Roberts, James M; Rich-Edwards, Janet W; McElrath, Thomas F; Garmire, Lana",Hypertension,10,27

Potential advantages of drug delivery by means of the pulmonary route include accessibility, non-invasiveness, ease of administration, and the possibility to reach an elaborate mucosal network of antigen-presenting cells. AREAS COVERED This review discusses current pulmonary vaccination strategies and their advantages and disadvantages. EXPERT OPINION To improve efficiency of vaccination and develop new strategies, a well-founded knowledge about composition and characterization of antigen-presenting cell populations throughout the respiratory tract is essential. In particular, respiratory tract dendritic cells, as key antigen-presenting cells in the lung, constitute an ideal target for vaccine delivery. Furthermore, particle size is a key factor when designing new inhalable vaccines, as size determines not only deposition in different respiratory tract compartments, but also how an antigen and its carrier will interact with lung tissue components and immune cells. An increased knowledge of different respiratory tract antigen-presenting cell populations and their interactions with other components of the immune system will enable new targeting strategies to improve the efficacy of pulmonary vaccination.","Blank, Fabian; Stumbles, Philip; von Garnier, Christophe",Expert opinion on drug delivery,10,1

METHODS We selected a convenience sample of 80 households and 20 schools in two densely populated communities in Bangladesh, one urban and one rural. We observed and recorded respiratory hygiene events with potential to spread viruses such as coughing, sneezing, spitting and nasal cleaning using a standardized assessment tool. RESULTS In 907 (81%) of 1122 observed events, households' participants coughed or sneezed into the air (i.e. uncovered), 119 (11%) into their hands and 83 (7%) into their clothing. Twenty-two per cent of women covered their coughs and sneezes compared to 13% of men (OR 2.6, 95% CI 1.6-4.3). Twenty-seven per cent of persons living in households with a reported monthly income of >72.6 US$ covered their coughs or sneezes compared to 13% of persons living in households with lower income (OR 3.2, 95% CI 1.6-6.2). In 956 (85%) of 1126 events, school participants coughed or sneezed into the air and 142 (13%) into their hands. Twenty-seven per cent of coughs/sneezes in rural schools were covered compared to 10% of coughs/sneezes in urban schools (OR 2.3, 95% CI 1.5-3.6). Hand washing was never observed after participants coughed or sneezed into their hands. CONCLUSION There is an urgent need to develop culturally appropriate, cost-effective and scalable interventions to improve respiratory hygiene practices and to assess their effectiveness in reducing respiratory pathogen transmission.","Nasreen, S; Azziz-Baumgartner, E; Gurley, E S; Winch, P J; Unicomb, L; Sharker, M A Y; Southern, D; Luby, S P",Tropical medicine & international health : TM & IH,10,1

After RFA, the ablated esophagus heals on acid suppressive therapy, and is re-populated with a stratified squamous epithelium, referred to as ""neosquamous epithelium (NSE)."" Because the ability of the NSE to protect the underlying tissue from recurrent insult by reflux is unclear, we assessed the barrier function of NSE by comparing it to that of the native upper squamous epithelium (USE) in subjects having undergone RFA. METHODS At varying intervals following RFA, the barrier function of NSE and USE were assessed in endoscopic biopsies by light and electron microscopy, and by measurement of electrical resistance (R) and fluorescein flux in mini-Ussing chambers. Chamber results were further compared with results from control biopsies (healthy distal esophagus). A claudin expression profile in the tight junctions (TJs) of NSE and USE was determined using Quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR. Differential expression of claudin-4 between NSE and USE was assayed by immunoblots. RESULTS USE was histologically normal whereas NSE showed dilated intercellular spaces and marked eosinophilia. NSE was also more permeable than USE and healthy controls, having lower mean R and higher fluorescein fluxes. Abnormally low R values for NSE were unrelated to the time period following RFA (or number of prior RFA sessions), being abnormal even 26 months after RFA. Abnormal permeability in NSE was associated with significantly lower values for claudin-4 and claudin-10 than in USE. CONCLUSIONS NSE commonly exhibits defective barrier function. As this defect will make it vulnerable to injury, inflammation, and destruction by acidic and weakly acidic refluxates, it may in part explain incidences of recurrence of BE following ablation.","Jovov, Biljana; Shaheen, Nicholas J; Orlando, Geraldine S; Djukic, Zorka; Orlando, Roy C",The American journal of gastroenterology,10,1

We conducted a retrospective cohort analysis of COVID-19 patients at Sutter Health, a large integrated health care system in northern California, to measure potential disparities. We used Sutter's integrated electronic health record to identify adults with suspected and confirmed COVID-19, and used multivariable logistic regression to assess risk of hospitalization, adjusting for known risk factors, such as race/ethnicity, sex, age, health, and socioeconomic variables. We analyzed 1,052 confirmed cases of COVID-19 from January 1-April 8, 2020. Among our findings, we observed that, compared with non-Hispanic white patients, African Americans had 2.7 times the odds of hospitalization, after adjusting for age, sex, comorbidities, and income. We explore possible explanations for this, including societal factors that either result in barriers to timely access to care or create circumstances in which patients view delaying care as the most sensible option.

Bacterial otopathogens and respiratory viruses interact and play important roles in acute otitis media development. A better understanding of viral and bacterial interactions may lead to innovative ways to lessen the burden of this common childhood disease. RECENT FINDINGS There has been increasing evidence that acute otitis media occurs during upper respiratory infection, even in the absence of nasopharyngeal bacterial colonization. Among the types of viruses associated with acute otitis media, respiratory syncytial virus continues to be the most commonly detected. It is still unclear whether viral load plays an important role in acute otitis media development, but symptomatic upper respiratory tract infection (as opposed to asymptomatic viral infection) is crucial. Widespread use of bacterial and viral vaccines in young children, including pneumococcal conjugate and influenza vaccines, has led to the reduction in otitis media-related healthcare use between 2001 and 2011. There has been no new vaccine against respiratory viruses other than influenza. SUMMARY Progress has been made toward the reduction of the burden of acute otitis media in the last decade. Success in reducing acute otitis media incidence will rely mainly on prevention of nasopharyngeal otopathogen colonization, as well as reduction in the incidence of viral upper respiratory tract infection.","Nokso-Koivisto, Johanna; Marom, Tal; Chonmaitree, Tasnee",Current opinion in pediatrics,10,1

The compounds of each herb in XFBD were collected from TCM-PTD, ETCM, TCMSP and SymMap database. Next, the information of meridian tropisms was collected from Chinese Pharmacopoeia(2015 edition), and the target information of the major constituents of XFBD were obtained from TCM-PTD, ETCM, TCMSP and TargetNet database. Subsequently, the target network model and the major modules were generated by Cytoscape, and the functional enrichment analysis of XFBD targets were completed by DAVID and STRING. As a result, ten of the 13 herbs in XFBD belonged to the lung meridian, and 326 of the 1 224 putative XFBD targets were associated with the disease target of COVID-19, among which 109 targets were enriched in the disease pathways of viral infection and lung injury.

Community pharmacy is increasingly considered a setting through which innovations can be implemented to achieve positive service and clinical outcomes. Small-scale pilot programmes often need scaled up nation-wide to affect population level change. This systematic review aims to identify facilitators and barriers to the national implementation of community pharmacy innovations. METHODS A systematic review exploring pharmacy staff perspectives of the barriers and facilitators to implementing innovations at a national level was conducted. The databases Medline, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, and Open Grey were searched and supplemented with additional search mechanisms such as Zetoc alerts. Eligible studies underwent quality assessment, and a directed content analysis approach to data extraction was conducted and aligned to the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR) to facilitate narrative synthesis. RESULTS Thirty-nine studies were included: 16 were qualitative, 21 applied a questionnaire design, and 2 were mixed methods. Overarching thematic areas spanning across the CFIR domains were pharmacy staff engagement (e.g. their positive and negative perceptions), operationalisation of innovations (e.g. insufficient resources and training), and external engagement (e.g. the perceptions of patients and other healthcare professionals, and their relationship with the community pharmacy). Study participants commonly suggested improvements in the training offered, in the engagement strategies adopted, and in the design and quality of innovations. CONCLUSIONS This study's focus on national innovations resulted in high-level recommendations to facilitate the development of successful national implementation strategies. These include (1) more robust piloting of innovations, (2) improved engagement strategies to increase awareness and acceptance of innovations, (3) promoting whole-team involvement within pharmacies to overcome time constraints, and (4) sufficient pre-implementation evaluation to gauge acceptance and appropriateness of innovations within real-world settings. The findings highlight the international challenge of balancing the professional, clinical, and commercial obligations within community pharmacy practice. A preliminary theory of how salient factors influence national implementation in the community pharmacy setting has been developed, with further research necessary to understand how the influence of these factors may differ within varying contexts. TRIAL REGISTRATION A protocol for this systematic review was developed and uploaded onto the PROSPERO international prospective register of systematic reviews database (Registration number: CRD42016038876 ).","Weir, Natalie M; Newham, Rosemary; Dunlop, Emma; Bennie, Marion",Implementation science : IS,10,1

Here we discuss the disease-modifying agents approved for the treatment of multiple sclerosis (MS) within this context. Interferon (IFN)-1a and -1b, which display antiviral activity, could be protective in the early stage of COVID-19 infection, although SARS-CoV-2 may have developed resistance to IFNs. However, in the hyper inflammation stage, IFNs may become detrimental by facilitating macrophage invasion in the lung and other organs. Glatiramer acetate and its analogues should not interfere with the development of COVID-19 and may be considered safe. Teriflunomide, a first-line oral drug used in the treatment of relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) may display antiviral activity by depleting cellular nucleotides necessary for viral replication. The other first-line drug, dimethyl fumarate, may afford protection against SARS-CoV-2 by activating the Nrf-2 pathway and reinforcing the cellular defences against oxidative stress. Concern has been raised on the use of second-line treatments for MS during COVID-19 pandemic. However, this concern is not always justified. For example, fingolimod, might be highly beneficial during the hyperinflammatory stage of COVID-19 for a number of mechanisms including the reinforcement of the endothelial barrier. Caution is suggested for the use of natalizumab, cladribine, alemtuzumab, and ocrelizumab, although MS disease recurrence after discontinuation of these drugs may overcome a potential risk for COVID-19 infection.","Alborghetti, Marika; Bellucci, Gianmarco; Gentile, Antonietta; Calderoni, Chiara; Nicoletti, Ferdinando; Capra, Ruggero; Salvetti, Marco; Centonze, Diego",Current neuropharmacology,10,23

Current treatments have significant side effects and have met with only partial success. Therefore, alternative antiviral drugs that efficiently block virus production are needed. During recent decades, RNA interference (RNAi) technology has not only become a powerful tool for functional genomics but also represents a new therapeutic approach for treating human diseases including viral infections. RNAi is a sequence-specific and post-transcriptional gene silencing process mediated by double-stranded RNA (dsRNA). As the HCV genome is a single-stranded RNA that functions as both a messenger RNA (mRNA) and replication template, it is an attractive target for the study of RNAi-based viral therapies. In this review, we will give a brief overview about the history and current status of RNAi and focus on its potential application as a therapeutic option for treatment for HCV infection.","Motavaf, M; Safari, S; Alavian, S M",Journal of viral hepatitis,10,1

This paper presents a pilot investigation on the geochemical transformation of DNTs affected by historical wastewater spillage from a typical TNT production company in Northwest China. In the horizontal direction, DNTs diffused from the evaporation pond to the surrounding area of the site, and the concentration of DNTs in the evaporation pond surface soil exceeded 1000 mg/kg. The horizontal distribution of DNTs in the site showed a migration trend to the east and south of evaporation, which was consistent with the terrain of high northwest and low southeast of the site. Due to the high water solubility of pollutants, water flow is the main driving force for the horizontal distribution of DNTs. In the vertical direction, the concentration of pollutants gradually increased with the depth of the soil. DNTs are mainly adsorbed in the third layer (6.0-8.0 m). It can be seen that the accumulation of the 2,4-DNTs-3-SO3- is obviously larger than that of the 2,4-DNTs-5-SO3-, which may be related to the steric hindrance effect of sulfonic acid groups in the two isomers. Results showed DNTs distribution strongly linked to soil physicochemical properties and the migration of DNTs in soil exhibited obvious heterogeneity in time and space. The carcinogenic risks in surface soil (0-1.5 m) and lower soil (1.5-6.0 m, 6.0-8.0 m) are all higher than 1✕10-6; non-carcinogenic risk surface soil (0-1.5 m) is 4.011✕10, which is greater than 1, indicating that they may cause certain harm to the human body. Meanwhile, this study presented a pioneering investigation for the contamination and geochemical transfer of DNTs.","Zhao, Wenchu; Yang, Xiao; Feng, Aixi; Yan, Xiulan; Wang, Lingqing; Liang, Tao; Liu, Juan; Ma, Huansong; Zhou, Yaoyu",Journal of environmental management,10,19

DESIGN Single site, nonrandomized, cross-sectional, teleophthalmologic study. METHODS Participants underwent a comprehensive evaluation in a Wi-Fi-equipped teleophthalmology mobile unit. The evaluation consisted of a basic anamnesis with a questionnaire form, brief systemic evaluations and an ophthalmologic evaluation that included visual field, intraocular pressure, pachymetry, anterior segment optical coherence tomography, posterior segment optical coherence tomography, and nonmydriatic fundus photography. The results were evaluated in real-time and follow-up calls were scheduled to complete a secondary questionnaire form. Risk factors were calculated for different types of ophthalmological referrals. RESULTS A total of 957 participants were screened. Out of 458 (48%) participants that have been referred, 305 (32%) had glaucoma, 136 (14%) had narrow-angle, 124 (13%) had cataract, 29 had (3%) diabetic retinopathy, 9 (1%) had macular degeneration, and 97 (10%) had other eye disease findings. Significant risk factors for ophthalmological referral consisted of older age, history of high blood pressure, diabetes mellitus, Hemoglobin A1c measurement of ≥6.5, and stage 2 hypertension. As for the ocular parameters, all but central corneal thickness were found to be significant, including having an intraocular pressure >21 mm Hg, vertical cup-to-disc ratio ≥0.5, visual field abnormalities, and retinal nerve fiber layer thinning.

For this purpose, we focused on two of the most notable neurophysiological effects of MI - the event-related desynchronization (ERD) level and the increase in cortical excitability assessed with navigated transcranial magnetic stimulation (nTMS). For TMS navigation, we used individual high-resolution 3D brain MRIs. Ten BCI-naive and healthy adults participated in this study. The MI (rest or left/right hand imagery using Graz-BCI paradigm) tasks were performed separately in the presence and absence of feedback. To investigate how much the presence/absence of vibrotactile feedback in MI BCI-based training could contribute to the sensorimotor cortical activations, we compared the MEPs amplitude during MI after training with and without feedback. In addition, the ERD levels during MI BCI-based training were investigated. Our findings provide evidence that applying vibrotactile feedback during MI training leads to (i) an enhancement of the desynchronization level of mu-rhythm EEG patterns over the contralateral motor cortex area corresponding to the MI of the non-dominant hand; (ii) an increase in motor cortical excitability in hand muscle representation corresponding to a muscle engaged by the MI.","Grigorev, Nikita A; Savosenkov, Andrey O; Lukoyanov, Maksim V; Udoratina, Anna; Shusharina, Natalia N; Kaplan, Alexander Ya; Hramov, Alexander E; Kazantsev, Victor B; Gordleeva, Susanna Yu",IEEE transactions on neural systems and rehabilitation engineering : a publication of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society,10,1

HRD testing provides an opportunity to optimise PARPi use in HGSC but methodologies are diverse and clinical application remains controversial. MATERIALS AND METHODS To define best practice for HRD testing in HGSC the ESMO Translational Research and Precision Medicine Working Group launched a collaborative project that incorporated a systematic review approach. The main aims were to (i) define the term 'HRD test'; (ii) provide an overview of the biological rationale and the level of evidence supporting currently available HRD tests; (iii) provide recommendations on the clinical utility of HRD tests in clinical management of HGSC. RESULTS A broad range of repair genes, genomic scars, mutational signatures and functional assays are associated with a history of HRD. Currently, the clinical validity of HRD tests in ovarian cancer is best assessed, not in terms of biological HRD status per se, but in terms of PARPi benefit. Clinical trials evidence supports the use of BRCA mutation testing and two commercially available assays that also incorporate genomic instability for identifying subgroups of HGSCs that derive different magnitudes of benefit from PARPi therapy, albeit with some variation by clinical scenario. These tests can be used to inform treatment selection and scheduling but their use is limited by a failure to consistently identify a subgroup of patients who derive no benefit from PARPis in most studies. Existing tests lack negative predictive value and inadequately address the complex and dynamic nature of the HRD phenotype. CONCLUSIONS Currently available HRD tests are useful for predicting likely magnitude of benefit from PARPis but better biomarkers are urgently needed to better identify current homologous recombination proficiency status and stratify HGSC management.","Miller, R E; Leary, A; Scott, C L; Serra, V; Lord, C J; Bowtell, D; Chang, D K; Garsed, D W; Jonkers, J; Ledermann, J A; Nik-Zainal, S; Ray-Coquard, I; Shah, S P; Matias-Guiu, X; Swisher, E M; Yates, L R",Annals of oncology : official journal of the European Society for Medical Oncology,10,20

Our aim was to determine whether T1 signal changes suggestive of gadolinium deposition occur in the brains of pediatric nonneurologic patients after multiple exposures to gadobenate dimeglumine. MATERIALS AND METHODS Thirty-four nonneurologic patients (group 1; 17 males/17 females; mean age, 7.18 years) who received between 5 and 15 injections (mean, 7.8 injections) of 0.05 mmol/kg of gadobenate during a mean of 2.24 years were compared with 24 control patients (group 2; 16 males/8 females; mean age, 8.78 years) who had never received gadolinium-based contrast agents. Exposure to gadobenate was for diagnosis and therapy monitoring. Five blinded readers independently determined the signal intensity at ROIs in the dentate nucleus, globus pallidus, pons, and thalamus on unenhanced T1-weighted spin-echo images from both groups. Unpaired t tests were used to compare signal-intensity values and dentate nucleus-pons and globus pallidus-thalamus signal-intensity ratios between groups 1 and 2. RESULTS Mean signal-intensity values in the dentate nucleus, globus pallidus, pons, and thalamus of gadobenate-exposed patients ranged from 366.4 to 389.2, 360.5 to 392.9, 370.5 to 374.9, and 356.9 to 371.0, respectively. Corresponding values in gadolinium-based contrast agent-naïve subjects were not significantly different (P > .05). Similarly, no significant differences were noted by any reader for comparisons of the dentate nucleus-pons signal-intensity ratios. One reader noted a difference in the mean globus pallidus-thalamus signal-intensity ratios (1.06 ± 0.006 versus 1.02 ± 0.009, P = .002), but this reflected nonsignificantly higher T1 signal in the thalamus of control subjects. The number of exposures and the interval between the first and last exposures did not influence signal-intensity values. CONCLUSIONS Signal-intensity increases potentially indicative of gadolinium deposition are not seen in pediatric nonneurologic patients after multiple exposures to low-dose gadobenate.","Schneider, G K; Stroeder, J; Roditi, G; Colosimo, C; Armstrong, P; Martucci, M; Buecker, A; Raczeck, P",AJNR.

OBJECTIVE This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of both injection botulinum toxin type A (botox) and surgical lip repositioning in the correction of the gummy smile due to hyperactive upper lip according to the resulting smile and the patients' satisfaction. MATERIAL AND METHODS The study consisted of 24 patients: 12 received the BTX-A (botulinum toxin type-A) injection and the remaining 12 underwent the surgical procedure (lip repositioning). The patients rated their satisfaction according to their gingival display that was defined as the difference between the lower margin of the upper lip and the superior margin of the right incisor, and patients were followed at 2 weeks, 2 months, and 6 months. Post injection and post-surgery with changes documented by photographs. Both groups answered a questionnaire addressing the overall appearance and they were asked to rate the improvement of their smile according to a 5-point aesthetic scale. RESULTS The patients rated the effects of BTX-A as highly favorable if we take into consideration that BTX-A had a temporary effect while the surgical procedure (lip repositioning) had a relapse likelihood of more than 80% because the lip reverted back to its original position with almost complete relapse after 6 months and not to mention the risks affiliated with the surgical procedures. CONCLUSION BTX-A injection exhibits better results than those of surgery and had given safer and more satisfactory results and achieved the required cosmetic patient requirement than lip repositioning.","Makkeiah, M O; Harfoush, M; Makkiah, A; Saneeva, L; Tuturov, N; Katbeh, I",Stomatologiia,10,12

STUDY DESIGN Cross-sectional study using an online survey disseminated during the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in Canada. METHODS Survey data from 572 direct service providers working in the homeless, supportive housing, and harm reduction service sectors were analyzed for this study. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression models were used to examine predictors of paid sick leave benefits. RESULTS One hundred one (17.7%) participants did not have any paid sick leave benefits. In the univariate models, paid sick leave was associated with older age, greater family income, full-time work, specific employment settings (supportive housing and not emergency shelters or harm reduction programs), having a regular medical doctor, and fewer occupational impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. Older age, full-time work, and non-receipt of emergency financial benefits remained statistically significant predictors in the multivariate model. CONCLUSIONS Although the majority of service providers working with people experiencing homelessness have some amount of paid sick leave benefits, there is a precariously employed subset of individuals who are younger and working part-time in the sector. Temporary expansion of paid sick leave and removal of waiting periods for new employees to qualify for benefits are recommended.","Kerman, N; Ecker, J; Tiderington, E; Gaetz, S; Kidd, S A",Public health,10,1

Many countries have regulated non-prescription medications available for use in self-medication. However, in countries such as Rwanda, where prescriptions are not required to purchase medications, prescription, non-prescription and traditional medications have been used for self-medication. Objectives To determine the reported self-medication use in Rwanda and to determine attitudes and reasons associated with parental decisions to self-medicate their children. Methods A cross-sectional multi-center questionnaire based quantitative study of 154 parents/caregivers of children under ten years undertaken in private and public health facilities. Results The use of self-medication was reported to be 77.9%. Among these parents/caregivers, 50.8% used modern self-medication only, 15.8% used traditional self-medication only and 33.3% used both types of self-medication. Paracetamol was the most commonly used drug in modern self-medication; the traditional drugs used were Rwandan local herbs. Parents/caregivers who used modern medicines had slightly more confidence in self-medication than self-medication users of traditional medicines (p=0.005). Parents/caregivers who used modern self-medication reported barriers to consultation as a reason to self-medicate more frequently than those who used traditional drugs. Having more than one child below 10 years of-age was the only socio-demographic factor associated with having used self-medication (AOR=4.74, CI: 1.94-11.58, p=0.001). Being above 30 years (AOR= 5.78, CI: 1.25-26.68, p=0.025) and living in Kigali (AOR=8.2, CI: 1.58-43.12, p=.0.012) were factors associated with preference of modern self- medication compared to traditional self-medication. Conclusion Self-medication is common in Rwanda. Parents/caregivers are involved in this practice regardless of their socio-demographic background.","Ukwishaka, Joyeuse; Umuhoza, Christian; Cartledge, Peter; McCall, Natalie",African health sciences,10,19

Here, we examined whether divergent thinking is differentially associated with the ability to construct novel imagined future events and recast future events (i.e., actual past events recast as future events) as opposed to recalled past events. We also examined whether different types of creative ideas (i.e., old ideas from memory or new ideas from imagination) underlie the linkage between divergent thinking and various autobiographical events. Divergent thinking ability was measured using the Alternate Uses Task (AUT). In Experiment 1, the amount of episodic details for both novel and recast future events was associated with divergent thinking (AUT scores), and this relationship was significant with AUT scores for new creative ideas but not old creative ideas. There was no significant relationship between divergent thinking and the amount of episodic detail for recalled past events. We extended these findings in Experiment 2 to a different test of divergent thinking, the Consequences Task. These results demonstrate that individual differences in divergent thinking are associated with the capacity to both imagine and recast future events.","Thakral, Preston P; Yang, Amanda C; Addis, Donna Rose; Schacter, Daniel L",Memory,10,31

We describe the clinic transition to virtual visits in April 2020 and reflect on our six-month experience in virtual visits. Clinic metrics were tracked. Electronic survey responses were collected from caregivers attending virtual visits. Input from the MGH DSP team was collected. From April to September 2020, we maintained patient volume (45 visits per month) and overall satisfaction score (6.7 out of 7) following a sudden, unanticipated transition to virtual visits. Survey of 17 caregivers attending virtual visits found that most were equipped with technology, had access to a private location, and most were able to access visit without any limitations. Caregivers appreciated the convenience of virtual visits but sometimes missed the personal connection of an in-person visit. Overall, though, virtual visits were frequently viewed as no different than office visits. Team members identified benefits and challenges of virtual visits, as well as lessons learned from this transition. We were able to maintain multidisciplinary, specialty care with optimal caregiver feedback and sustained number of patient visits.","Santoro, Stephanie L; Donelan, Karen; Haugen, Kelsey; Oreskovic, Nicolas M; Torres, Amy; Skotko, Brian G","American journal of medical genetics.

These two types of metabolic surgery alter the anatomy and function of digestive tract producing significant weight loss in morbidly obese patients but may lead to malnutrition. AIM Analysis of incidence and severity of malnutrition after bariatric surgery in patients submitted to RYGB or LSG during 12 months of follow-up. MATERIAL AND METHODS Retrospective study of 98 patients after RYGB (n = 47) or LSG (n = 51) assessed for nutritional deficiencies during 12 months after surgery was conducted. The differences in body mass index (BMI) and blood tests including erythrocytes, haemoglobin, total protein, albumin, iron, ferritin, transferrin, vitamin B12, folic acid, calcium and phosphorus concentrations were compared between groups before the operations and at 1 and 12 months. RESULTS Nutritional deficiencies were common before surgery with prevalence up to 19.6% for albumin in the LSG group. Median preoperative BMI levels and albumin concentrations were higher in the RYGB group compared to the LSG group, but there was no difference in percent excess weight loss (%EWL) at 1 and 12 months between LSG and RYGB. One month after LSG erythrocyte count, haemoglobin, iron, ferritin and transferrin levels were significantly higher than in the RYGB group. These differences subsided at 12 months. At 12 months, only the prevalence of vitamin B12 deficiency was significantly higher in the RYGB group. CONCLUSION Both RYGB and LSG lead to nutritional deficiencies despite different properties of operations and similar %EWL during follow-up.","Antoniewicz, Aleksander; Kalinowski, Piotr; Kotulecka, Kamila J; Kocoń, Piotr; Paluszkiewicz, Rafał; Remiszewski, Piotr; Zieniewicz, Krzysztof",Obesity surgery,10,19

Mammalian genomes encode 20 canonical RGS and 16 Gα genes with key roles in physiology and disease. To understand the principles governing the selectivity of Gα regulation by RGS, we examine the catalytic activity of all canonical human RGS proteins and their selectivity for a complete set of Gα substrates using real-time kinetic measurements in living cells. The data reveal rules governing RGS-Gα recognition, the structural basis of its selectivity, and provide principles for engineering RGS proteins with defined selectivity. The study also explores the evolution of RGS-Gα selectivity through ancestral reconstruction and demonstrates how naturally occurring non-synonymous variants in RGS alter signaling. These results provide a blueprint for decoding signaling selectivity and advance our understanding of molecular recognition principles.","Masuho, Ikuo; Balaji, Santhanam; Muntean, Brian S; Skamangas, Nickolas K; Chavali, Sreenivas; Tesmer, John J G; Babu, M Madan; Martemyanov, Kirill A",Cell,10,29

Research also suggests that informal coercion, including subtle inducements, leverage, or threats, is prevalent and influential in psychiatric settings. Digital technologies bring promise for expanding access to psychiatric care and improving delivery of these services; however, use and misuse of digital technologies, such as electronic medical record flags, surveillance cameras, videoconferencing, and risk assessment tools, could lead to unexpected coercion of patients with mental illness. Using several composite case examples, the author proposes that the integration of digital technologies into psychiatric care can influence patients' experiences of coercion and provides recommendations for studying and addressing these effects.","Morris, Nathaniel P",Psychiatric services,10,31

The recent Ebola, Zika and COVID-19 outbreaks demonstrate the devastating human, social and economic impacts of such diseases if they are not prevented or controlled, ideally at source. The risk drivers for zoonoses, which are complex and often interdependent, include climate change and related disasters, antimicrobial resistance, and anthropogenic drivers such as land-use changes and animal production practices. Understanding these drivers requires a better understanding of the ecology of zoonotic diseases at the human-animal-environment interface. Biosecurity and biosafety are critical for reducing the risk of accidental or deliberate release and should be included in risk management strategies. International frameworks for sustainable development, climate change, and disaster risk reduction have all integrated health as one of the core areas of work, calling for better preparedness and response to biological hazards and increased health system resilience. To improve their ability to prevent, prepare for, and respond to emerging and re-emerging threats, countries should address these risk drivers, taking a multidisciplinary One Health approach that involves the animal and human health and environment sectors.

For this challenge we propose a finger artery non-invasive tono-oscillometric monitor (FANTOM) which is an automated low-cost instrument for measuring blood pressure and hemodynamic parameters from the fingertip. The sensing technology is highly scalable and could be integrated to a pulse oximeter probe for increased patient comfort. A tonometric cuff-less mechatronic system is used to apply pressure on the fingertip for (i) measuring oscillometric blood pressure, (ii) recording arterial waveform and for (iii) constructing central blood pressure (CBP) waveform. Clinical study on volunteers (n = 33) was performed against a commercially available arm cuff device yielding systolic and diastolic readings ((mean±SD) mmHg) of (-0.9 ± 7.3) mmHg and (-3.3 ± 6.6) mmHg respectively. The results comply with the Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation (AAMI) standard for non-invasive blood pressure monitors. The arterial pulse recording morphology was compared against a volume clamp device (CNSystems CNAP 500) (n = 3) resulting in similar performance. Comparison of CBP against a pulse wave analysis (PWA) device (Atcor Medical Sphygmocor XCEL) (n = 5) revealed central aortic systolic pulse (CASP) and central augmentation index (cAIx) estimates with precision and accuracy of (2.0 ± 3.7) mmHg and (1.4 ± 6.2)% respectively. In conclusion, the results indicate that the proposed technology could be useful in the development of new portable or wearable blood pressure monitors. The sensing technology is highly scalable and could be integrated to a pulse oximeter probe for increased patient comfort.","Panula, Tuukka; Koivisto, Tero; Pänkäälä, Mikko; Niiranen, Teemu; Kantola, Ilkka; Kaisti, Matti",Biosensors & bioelectronics,10,28

Using data on 43,538 hospitalized patients admitted between February 21 and July 12, 2020, we evaluated variations in intensive care unit (ICU) admissions and mortality over three periods: the early phase (February 20-March 13), the period of highest pressure on healthcare (March 14-April 25, when COVID-19 patients exceeded the ICU pre-pandemic bed capacity), and the declining phase (April 26-July 12). Compared to the early phase, patients above 70 years of age were admitted less often to an ICU during highest pressure on healthcare (odds ratio OR 0.47, 95%CI: 0.41-0.54) with longer delays (incidence rate ratio IRR 1.82, 95%CI: 1.52-2.18), and lower chances of death in ICU (OR 0.47, 95%CI: 0.34-0.64).

Every day, millions of people were subjected to diagnostic testing for Covid-19, all over the world. Molecular tests helped in the diagnosis of current infection by detecting the presence of viral genome whereas serological tests helped in detecting the presence of antibody in blood as well as contributed to vaccine development. This testing helped in understanding the immunogenicity, community prevalence, geographical spread, conditions post-infection. However, with the contagious nature of the virus, biological specimen sampling involved the risk of transmission and spread of infection. Clinic or pathology visit was the most concerning part. Trained personnel and resources was another barrier. In this scenario, microsampling played an important role due to its most important advantage of remote, contactless, small volume, self-sampling. Minimum requirements for sample storage and ease of shipment added value in this situation. The highly sensitive instruments and validated assay formats assured the accuracy of results and stability of samples.

EGT resembles the human keloid. While the events leading to keloid formation are not fully elucidated, tissue hypoxia has been proposed as a major contributing factor. The objective of this study was to investigate tissue oxygen saturation in healing full-thickness wounds created on the horse limb and body, using near-infrared spectroscopy. Spectroscopic reflectance data were collected from both anatomic sites at specific times following wounding. The oxygen saturation values of limb wounds were significantly inferior to those of body wounds during the early period of healing, indicating a temporary, relative state of hypoxia in the former during the inflammatory phase of repair. Horses present a weak, persistent inflammatory response to wounding, especially at the limb level. The relative hypoxia present acutely in limb wounds of horses may promote a feeble yet prolonged inflammatory response, which could interfere with and retard the subsequent phases of healing. Ongoing low-grade inflammation in horse wounds is accompanied by up-regulation of various inflammatory and profibrotic mediators, which might ultimately promote the development of fibroproliferative disorders such as EGT.","Celeste, Christophe J; Deschene, Karine; Riley, Christopher B; Theoret, Christine L",Wound repair and regeneration : official publication of the Wound Healing Society [and] the European Tissue Repair Society,10,7

This review attempts to provide a comprehensive overview of the COVID-19 research in India including design aspects, through the clinical trials registered in the Clinical Trials Registry - India (CTRI) till June 5, 2020. One hundred and twenty two registered trials on COVID-19 were extracted from the CTRI database. These trials were categorized into modern medicine (n=42), traditional medicine (n=67) and miscellaneous (n=13). Of the 42 modern medicine trials, 28 were on repurposed drugs, used singly (n=24) or in combination (n=4). Of these 28 trials, 23 were to evaluate their therapeutic efficacy in different severities of the disease. There were nine registered trials on cell- and plasma-based therapies, two phytopharmaceutical trials and three vaccine trials. The traditional medicine trials category majorly comprised Ayurveda (n=45), followed by homeopathy (n=14) and others (n=8) from Yoga, Siddha and Unani. Among the traditional medicine category, 31 trials were prophylactic and 36 were therapeutic, mostly conducted on asymptomatic or mild-to-moderate COVID-19 patients.

We aimed to evaluate the associations between overweight (25 kg/m2 < BMI ≤ 29.9 kg/m2), obese (30 kg/m2 < BMI ≤ 39.9 kg/m2) and morbidly obese (BMI > 40 kg/m2) BMIs and outcomes in septic patients. METHODS We searched the PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, Cochrane Library and ClinicalTrials.gov databases for studies published by December 1, 2016. Electronic database searches yielded 3713 articles, eight of which were included in this meta-analysis. Data were independently extracted by two reviewers, and a third reviewer participated in making decisions as needed. We used Review Manager to conduct the analysis, and the outcomes were reported with odds ratios (ORs) or mean differences (MDs). The primary outcome was mortality, and the secondary outcome was length of stay (LOS) in the intensive care unit (ICU) or the hospital. RESULTS Data from eight studies involving a total of 9696 patients were pooled in our final analysis. Compared with patients with normal BMI (18.5 kg/m2 < BMI ≤ 24.9 kg/m2), patients with BMI ≥ 25 kg/m2 exhibited decreased mortality (OR 0.81; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.74-0.89, P < 0.0001). In subgroup analysis, compared with normal-weight patients, overweight patients had lower mortality (OR 0.87; 95% CI 0.77-0.97, P = 0.02), whereas obese (OR 0.89, 95% CI 0.72-1.10, P = 0.29) and morbidly obese (OR 0.64, 95% CI 0.38-1.08, P = 0.09) patients did not exhibit significantly reduced mortality.

However, up to 90% of people with schizophrenia begin smoking before the onset of their illness, thus smoking could be an independent risk factor for schizophrenia. Prenatal exposure to maternal cigarette smoke is also associated with psychiatric problems in adolescence. Therefore, our aim was to undertake a systematic review and meta-analysis to explore the effect of smoking, and prenatal smoke exposure, on risk of schizophrenia. Method We systematically searched Medline, Embase, PsychInfo, Maternity and Infant Care, and Web of Science (from inception to February 2018) to identify comparative observational studies of the risk of schizophrenia in relation to smoking status. Measures of Relative Risk (RR) were pooled in a meta-analysis with 95% confidence intervals, using random effects model. Results Twelve studies (9 cohort, 3 case-control) were included. Odds ratios (OR) and hazard ratios (HR) were pooled together to estimate pooled RRs and estimates combined in a meta-analysis on an assumption of constant risk over time. Smokers had a significantly increased risk of schizophrenia compared to non-smokers (RR 1.99, 95% CI 1.10-3.61, I2= 97%, 5 studies). Exposure to prenatal smoke increased the risk of schizophrenia by 29% (95% CI 1.10-1.51, I2= 71%, 7 studies). Sensitivity analyses identified no significant differences between the results from studies reporting OR and HR. Conclusions Our findings suggest smoking, and prenatal smoke exposure, may be an independent risk factor for schizophrenia. Care should be taken when inferring causation, given the observational nature of the studies. Implications In this meta-analysis of 12 studies smokers had a significantly increased risk of schizophrenia compared to non-smokers. Exposure to prenatal tobacco smoke also increased the risk of schizophrenia by 29% compared to those with no exposure to prenatal tobacco smoke. Our findings suggest that smoking, and prenatal tobacco smoke exposure, may be independent risk factors for schizophrenia. These results may have important public health implications for decreasing the incidence of schizophrenia. The possibility of a causal link between smoking and schizophrenia warrants further investigation.","Hunter, Abby; Murray, Rachael; Asher, Laura; Leonardi-Bee, Jo",Nicotine & tobacco research : official journal of the Society for Research on Nicotine and Tobacco,10,1

METHODS Every patient treated with mechanical thrombectomy for acute ischemic stroke from September 2005 to December 2011 was consecutively included in this retrospective analysis. Baseline and outcome data were retrieved from computerized records at the hospital. National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score and the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score were used as outcome parameters. Favorable outcome was defined as a mRS score of 0-2, corresponding to independence in activities of daily living. We also evaluated revascularization and severe adverse events, with focus on symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage. RESULTS Good functional outcome (mRS 0-2) was achieved in 50 % (120/240) of all patients. For patients with no neurological deficit prior to stroke onset (i.e., mRS = 0 before stroke), the proportion with good functional outcome was 54 %. Symptomatic hemorrhages occurred in 4.6 % of the cases (5.7 % in the anterior circulation). CONCLUSION In summary, our results supports that mechanical thrombectomy is a safe and effective method to restore blood flow in selected patients suffering from an acute ischemic stroke.","Kuntze Söderqvist, Asa; Kaijser, Magnus; Söderman, Michael; Holmin, Staffan; Wahlgren, Nils; Andersson, Tommy",Neuroradiology,10,29

However, there are no standardized recommendations yet for CE training courses in Europe. The following suggestions in this curriculum are based on the experience of European CE training courses directors. It is suggested that 12 hours be dedicated for either a small bowel capsule endoscopy (SBCE) or a colon capsule endoscopy (CCE) course with 4 hours for an introductory CCE course delivered in conjunction with SBCE courses. SBCE courses should include state-of-the-art lectures on indications, contraindications, complications, patient management and hardware and software use. Procedural issues require approximately 2 hours. For CCE courses 2.5 hours for theoretical lessons and 3.5 hours for procedural issued are considered appropriate. Hands-on training on reading and interpretation of CE cases using a personal computer (PC) for 1 or 2 delegates is recommended for both SBCE and CCE courses. A total of 6 hours hands-on session- time should be allocated. Cases in a SBCE course should cover SB bleeding, inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), tumors and variants of normal and cases with various types of polyps covered in CCE courses.

MATERIALS AND METHODS The primary objective was to describe the characteristics of ICU-acquired enterococcal BSI in critically ill patients with COVID-19. A secondary objective was to exploratorily assess the predictors of 30-day mortality in critically ill COVID-19 patients with ICU-acquired enterococcal BSI. RESULTS During the study period, 223 patients with COVID-19 were admitted to COVID-19-dedicated ICUs in our centre. Overall, 51 episodes of enterococcal BSI, occurring in 43 patients, were registered. 29 (56.9%) and 22 (43.1%) BSI were caused by Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium, respectively. The cumulative incidence of ICU-acquired enterococcal BSI was of 229 episodes per 1000 ICU admissions (95% mid-p confidence interval [CI] 172-298). Most patients received an empirical therapy with at least one agent showing in vitro activity against the blood isolate (38/43, 88%). The crude 30-day mortality was 42% (18/43) and 57% (4/7) in the entire series and in patients with vancomycin-resistant E. faecium BSI, respectively. The sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score showed an independent association with increased mortality (odds ratio 1.32 per one-point increase, with 95% confidence interval 1.04-1.66, p = .021).

It has fallen out of favor due to the emergence of the adjustable gastric band and late complications including band erosion and stenosis. Options for revision include conversion to a Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) or VBG reversal via gastrogastrostomy. Patients undergoing revision of a previous VBG were identified. VBG reversal was performed laparoscopically. Conversion to RYGB was performed by both laparotomy and laparoscopy. Perioperative outcomes and long-term weight loss were evaluated. A total of 34 patients with a previous open VBG underwent revision over a nearly 8-year period (January 2003 to September 2010). Conversion to RYGB was performed in 25 (four laparoscopically) and VBG reversal in nine patients. Mean age for all patients was 56.3 years (range 36-70), and VBG had been performed 23 years previously (range 16-30). Patients to undergo VBG reversal were more likely to be male and less likely to be morbidly obese at the time of revision. Operative time and length of stay were shorter for laparoscopic procedures. Complication rates did not differ based on technique or procedure. Patients with a previous VBG may present with complications and obesity decades after the primary procedure. Revisional surgery can be accomplished laparoscopically. Following VBG reversal, most patients gain weight and many become morbidly obese again. Conversion to RYGB is associated with weight loss and resolution of morbid obesity in most patients. When feasible, laparoscopic conversion to RYGB may offer the best outcomes.","Tevis, Sarah; Garren, Michael J; Gould, Jon C",Obesity surgery,10,31

However, these procedures remain technically demanding due to flexible technology issues: difficult imaging, limited energy devices, lack of staplers, unsatisfactory suturing abilities, and so on. Transgastric laparoscopy or hybrid laparoscopy/flex endoscopy has been described for almost two decades as an alternative to a pure endoluminal approach, mainly for pancreatic pseudocyst drainage and full-thickness and mucosal resection of various lesions. The approach has never been widely adopted mostly due to cumbersome and difficult to maintain methods of gastric access. We propose to expand the indications of transgastric laparoscopy by using novel endoscopically placed ports to replicate endoscopic procedures particularly in the difficult to access proximal stomach such as endoluminal antireflux surgery. Under general anesthesia, five female pigs (mean weight: 27.6 kg) had endoscopic placement of 3, 5 mm intragastric ports (Endo-TAGSS, Leakwood KS, USA) using a technique similar to percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy. A 5-mm laparoscope was used for visualization. Laparoendoscopic-assisted plication of the gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) was performed using 3-0 interrupted sutures (Polysorb®, Covidien, Mansfield, MA, USA). A functional lumen imagine probe (EndoFLIP®, Crospon, Inc., Galway, Ireland) was used to measure diameter, cross sectional area (CSA), distensibility, and compliance of GEJ before and after intervention. Once the TAGSS ports were removed, the gastrotomies were closed by using endoscopic over-the-scope clips. At the end of the procedure, animals were euthanized. Five laparoendoscopic-assisted endoluminal plications were performed. The mean operative time was 65.6 min (Endoscopic evaluation: 3.2 min, TAGSS Insertion: 11 min, EndoFLIP evaluation + GEJ Plication: 43.25 min, gastric wall closure: 15 minutes). In all cases, this technique was effective and allowed to achieve an adequate GEJ plication by endoscopic grading and EndoFLIP measurements. Median pre-plication GEJ diameter (D) and median pre-plication GEJ cross-sectional area (CSA) were 11.42 mm (8.6-13.6 mm) and 104.8 mm2 (58-146 mm2). After the procedure, these values were decreased to 6.14 mm (5.7-6.6 mm) and 29.8 mm2 (25-34 mm2) respectively (p = 0.0079). Median pre-plication distensibility (d) and compliance (C) were 7.87 mm2/mmHg (2.4-22.69 mm2/mmHg) and 190.56 mm3/mmHg (70.9-502.8 mm3/mmHg). After the procedure, these values decreased to 1.5 mm2/mmHg (0.7-2.2 mm2/mmHg) and 52.17 mm3/mmHg (21.9-98.7 mm3/mmHg) respectively (p = 0.0317). No intraoperative events were observed. Endoscopically, all valves were felt to be transitioned from a Hill grade 3 (normal state for the animal model) to a Hill grade 1 at the procedure completion. A hybrid laparoendoscopic approach is a feasible alternative for performing intragastric procedures with the assistance of conventional laparoscopic instruments; especially in cases where the intervention location limits the access to standard endoscopy or where endoscopic technology is inadequate. Further evaluation is planned in survival models and clinical trials.","Gonzalez, C; Kwak, J-M; Davrieux, F; Watanabe, R; Marescaux, J; Swanström, L L",Diseases of the esophagus : official journal of the International Society for Diseases of the Esophagus,10,1

The purpose of this study was to assess the impact of robotic assistance on novice suturing performance, safety, and workload in the operating room. METHODS Medical students (n = 34), without prior laparoscopic suturing experience, were enrolled in an Institutional Review Board-approved, randomized protocol. After viewing an instructional video, subjects were tested in intracorporeal suturing on two identical, live, porcine Nissen fundoplication models; they placed three gastro-gastric sutures using conventional laparoscopic instruments in one model and using robotic assistance (da Vinci) in the other, in random order. Each knot was objectively scored based on time, accuracy, and security. Injuries to surrounding structures were recorded. Workload was assessed using the validated National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) task load index (TLX) questionnaire, which measures the subjects' self-reported performance, effort, frustration, and mental, physical, and temporal demands of the task. Analysis was by paired t-test; p < 0.05 was considered significant. RESULTS Compared with laparoscopy, robotic assistance enabled subjects to suture faster (595 +/- 22 s versus 459 +/- 137 s, respectively; p < 0.001), achieve higher overall scores (0 +/- 1 versus 95 +/- 128, respectively; p < 0.001), and commit fewer errors per knot (1.15 +/- 1.35 versus 0.05 +/- 0.26, respectively; p < 0.001). Subjects' overall score did not improve between the first and third attempt for laparoscopic suturing (0 +/- 0 versus 0 +/- 0; p = NS) but improved significantly for robotic suturing (49 +/- 100 versus 141 +/- 152; p < 0.001). Moreover, subjects indicated on the NASA-TLX scale that the task was more difficult to perform with laparoscopic instruments compared with robotic assistance (99 +/- 15 versus 57 +/- 23; p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS Compared with standard laparoscopy, robotic assistance significantly improved intracorporeal suturing performance and safety of novices in the operating room while decreasing their workload. Moreover, the robot significantly shortened the learning curve of this difficult task. Further study is needed to assess the value of robotic assistance for experienced surgeons, and validated robotic training curricula need to be developed.","Stefanidis, Dimitrios; Wang, Fikre; Korndorffer, James R; Dunne, J Bruce; Scott, Daniel J",Surgical endoscopy,10,22

METHODS A retrospective cohort study compared telehealth patients with matched controls seen in the office. The feasibility of a thorough patient evaluation in a single telehealth visit without a follow-up office visit was assessed. Both groups were also compared for completeness of physical exam, management, follow-up recommendations, and correlation of physical exam findings with intraoperative findings. RESULTS 100 children [mean age (SD) = 20.7 (15.6) months] with a chief complaint of recurrent acute otitis media and 128 children [5.4 (3.2) years] with a chief complaint of sleep-disordered breathing were evaluated. Recommendations for surgery, additional studies, or routine follow-up were similar between telehealth and office-based groups. Physical exam feasibility was significantly different for the nasal cavity, oropharynx, and middle ear (P < .001). Patients who underwent office-based consultation were much more likely to have findings of middle ear fluid at the time of tympanostomy tube placement (79.3% vs 39.3%, P = .002). There was no significant difference between preoperative and intraoperative tonsil size discrepancies (P = .749). CONCLUSION Telehealth can be used successfully for the evaluation of pediatric patients with sleep-disordered breathing; however, reliance on history alone may result in unnecessary tympanostomy tube placement in patients with recurrent acute otitis media. Physical examination of the oropharynx, nasal cavity, and middle ear via telehealth presents a unique challenge in pediatric otolaryngology.","Kolb, Caroline M; Born, Kristen; Banker, Karen; Barth, Patrick; Aaronson, Nicole L",International journal of pediatric otorhinolaryngology,10,25

DESIGN Prospective clinical study. SETTING Abdominal wall unit, university hospital. PATIENTS Between January 1995 and December 2008, data from 55 consecutive patients who had undergone laparoscopic (n = 35) or open (n = 20) lumbar hernia repair. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES The primary endpoint was recurrence; secondary endpoints were patient outcomes (morbidity, pain, and return to normal activity). RESULTS Mean operating time (P = .01), hospital stay, return to normal activity, analgesic consumption, and pain at 1 month (P < .001) were significantly less in the laparoscopic group. Complications were similar in the 2 groups (37% vs 40%, respectively; P = .50). Traumatic hernias increased local complications versus incisional lumbar hernias (71.4% vs 29%; P = .007). Consumption of analgesics (6.8 ± 6.5 vs 18.1 ± 9.1; P < .001) and pain during the first month (no pain: 90% vs 54.3%; P = .015) were significantly less with a lightweight versus medium-weight mesh. The risk factors associated with recurrences development were localization (P = .01) and size (P = .008). Recurrence rates were 2.9% in the laparoscopic group and 15% in the open group (P = .13). CONCLUSIONS Outcomes did not differ with respect to morbidity and recurrence rate after long-term follow-up; however, this study suggested that laparoscopic approach for lumbar hernia is safe, effective, and more efficient than open repair and can be considered the procedure of choice. Open surgery may be considered the best option in the diffuse hernias with size larger than 15 cm.","Moreno-Egea, Alfredo; Alcaraz, Andres C; Cuervo, Marian C",Surgical innovation,10,1

We identified twenty-two articles from fourteen RCT. Most studies were conducted in adults. These used between 80 and 2000 mg ARA per d and were of 1-12 weeks duration. Supplementation with ARA doses as low as 80 mg/d increased the content of ARA in different blood fractions. Overall there seem to be few marked benefits for adults of increasing ARA intake from the typical usual intake of 100-200 mg/d to as much as 1000 mg/d; the few studies using higher doses (1500 or 2000 mg/d) also report little benefit. However, there may be an impact of ARA on cognitive and muscle function which could be particularly relevant in the ageing population. The studies reviewed here suggest no adverse effects in adults of increased ARA intake up to at least 1000-1500 mg/d on blood lipids, platelet aggregation and blood clotting, immune function, inflammation or urinary excretion of ARA metabolites. However, in many areas there are insufficient studies to make firm conclusions, and higher intakes of ARA are deserving of further study. Based on the RCT reviewed, there are not enough data to make any recommendations for specific health effects of ARA intake.","Calder, Philip C; Campoy, Cristina; Eilander, Ans; Fleith, Mathilde; Forsyth, Stewart; Larsson, Per-Olof; Schelkle, Bettina; Lohner, Szimonetta; Szommer, Aliz; van de Heijning, Bert J M; Mensink, Ronald P",The British journal of nutrition,10,16

At the same time, the volatile COVID-19 situation presents unique, unforeseen daily disruptive task setbacks that divert employees' attention from routinized work tasks and require them to respond adaptively and effortfully. Yet, little is known about how telework employees react to such complex demands and regulate their work behaviors while working from home. Drawing on Hobfoll's (1989) conservation of resources (COR) theory, we develop a multilevel, two-stage moderated-mediation model arguing that daily COVID-19 task setbacks are stressors that would trigger a resource loss process and will thus be positively related to the employee's end-of-day emotional exhaustion. The emotionally exhausted employee then enters a resource preservation mode that precipitates a positive relationship between end-of-day exhaustion and next-day work withdrawal behaviors. Based on COR, we also predict that the relation between daily COVID-19 task setbacks and exhaustion would be more positive in telework employees who have higher (vs. lower) task interdependence with coworkers, but organizations could alleviate the positive relation between end-of-day exhaustion and next-day work withdrawal behavior by providing employees with higher (vs. lower) telework task support. We collected daily experience-sampling data over 10 workdays from 120 employees (Level 1, n = 1,022) who were teleworking full-time due to the pandemic lockdown. The results generally supported our hypotheses, and their implications for scholars and managers during and beyond the pandemic are discussed.

This study focuses on investigating the clinical usability of a functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS)-derived machine learning classifier to perform automated and real-time classification of maintenance and emergence states during sevoflurane anesthesia. For 19 surgical procedures, we examine the entire continuum of the maintenance-transition-emergence phases and evaluate the predictive capability of a support vector machine (SVM) classifier during these phases. We demonstrate the robustness of the predictions made by the SVM classifier and compare its performance with that of minimum alveolar concentration (MAC) and bispectral (BIS) index-based predictions. The fNIRS-SVM investigated in this study provides evidence to the usability of the fNIRS signal for anesthesia monitoring. The method presented enables classification of the signal as maintenance or emergence automatically as well as in real-time with high accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity. The features local mean HbTotal, std [Formula: see text], local min Hb and [Formula: see text], and range Hb and [Formula: see text] were found to be robust biomarkers of this binary classification task.

Viable peripheral nerve allografts (PNAs) as growth-guide conduits are immunologically rejected and all anucleated donor/host axonal segments undergo Wallerian degeneration. In contrast, we report that ablation-type sciatic PNIs repaired by neurorrhaphy of viable sciatic PNAs and a polyethylene glycol (PEG)-fusion protocol using PEG immediately restored axonal continuity for many axons, reinnervated/maintained their neuromuscular junctions, and prevented much Wallerian degeneration. PEG-fused PNAs permanently restored many sciatic-mediated behaviors within 2-6 weeks. PEG-fused PNAs were not rejected even though host/donors were neither immunosuppressed nor tissue-matched in outbred female Sprague Dawley rats. Innate and adaptive immune responses to PEG-fused sciatic PNAs were analyzed using electron microscopy, immunohistochemistry, and quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction for morphological features, T cell and macrophage infiltration, major histocompatibility complex (MHC) expression, apoptosis, expression of cytokines, chemokines, and cytotoxic effectors. PEG-fused PNAs exhibited attenuated innate and adaptive immune responses by 14-21 days postoperatively, as evidenced by (a) many axons and cells remaining viable, (b) significantly reduced infiltration of cytotoxic and total T cells and macrophages, (c) significantly reduced expression of inflammatory cytokines, chemokines, and MHC proteins, (d) consistently low apoptotic response. Morphologically and/or biochemically, PEG-fused sciatic PNAs often resembled sciatic autografts or intact sciatic nerves. In brief, PEG-fused PNAs are an unstudied, perhaps unique, example of immune tolerance of viable allograft tissue in a nonimmune-privileged environment and could greatly improve the clinical outcomes for PNIs relative to current protocols.","Smith, Tyler A; Ghergherehchi, Cameron L; Mikesh, Michelle; Shores, Jaimie T; Tucker, Haley O; Bittner, George D",Journal of neuroscience research,10,16

As DLM is a congenital anomaly, the ultrastructural features and morphology differ from those of the normal meniscus, potentially leading to meniscal tears. Snapping and pain are common symptoms, with occasional limitations of extension, in patients with DLM. Examination of the contralateral knee is necessary as DLM affects both knees. While simple radiographs may provide indirect signs of a DLM, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is essential for diagnosis and treatment planning. Although DLM was traditionally classified into three categories, namely, complete, incomplete, and Wrisberg DLM, a recent MRI classification provides useful information for surgical planning because the MRI classification was based on the peripheral detachment in patients with DLM, as follows: no shift, anterocentral shift, posterocentral shift, and central shift. Asymptomatic patients require close follow-up without surgical treatment, while patients with symptoms often require surgery. Total or subtotal meniscectomy, which has been traditionally performed, leads to an increased risk of degenerative arthritis; thus, partial meniscectomy is currently considered the treatment of choice for DLM. In addition to partial meniscectomy, meniscal repair of peripheral detachment is recommended for stabilization in patients with DLM to preserve the function of the meniscus. Previous studies have reported that partial meniscectomy with or without meniscal repair is effective and shows superior clinical and radiological outcomes to those of total or subtotal meniscectomy during the short- to long-term follow-up. Our preferred principle for DLM treatment is reduction, followed by reshaping with reference to the midbody of the medial meniscus and repair as firm as possible.","Kim, Jun-Ho; Ahn, Jin Hwan; Kim, Joo-Hwan; Wang, Joon Ho",Journal of experimental orthopaedics,10,16

OBJECTIVE We examine the relationship between the COVID-19 lockdowns and mental health-related Google searches in 11 Latin American countries. We include the following countries: Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico, Paraguay, Peru, and Uruguay. We also explore how changes in search patterns relate to income support policies and to COVID-19 death rates. METHOD Using Google Trends data and an event-study design, as well as a difference-in-differences analysis, we investigate the association between country specific stay-at-home orders and internet searches including the following words: insomnia, stress, anxiety, sadness, depression, and suicide. RESULTS We find three main patterns. First, searches for insomnia peak but then decline. Second, searches for stress, anxiety, and sadness increase and remain high throughout the lockdown. Third, there is no substantial change in depression-related or suicide-related searches after the lockdown. In terms of potential mechanisms, our results suggest that searches declined for suicide and insomnia following the passage of each country's income support, while in countries with higher COVID-19-related death rates, searches for insomnia, stress, and anxiety increased by more. CONCLUSIONS Our results suggest that, in Latin America, Google searches for words associated with mild mental health disorders increased during the COVID-19 stay-at-home orders. Nonetheless, these conclusions should not be construed as a general population mental health deterioration, as we cannot verify that search indicators are accurately related to the users' current feelings and behaviors, and as internet users may not be representative of the population in this region.","Silverio-Murillo, Adan; Hoehn-Velasco, Lauren; Rodriguez Tirado, Abel; Balmori de la Miyar, Jose Roberto",Social science & medicine,10,17

The physician assistant (PA) profession has historically not employed a profession-specific entrance exam, and the idea was never seriously explored until the Physician Assistant College Admissions Test was developed recently by a commercial assessment publisher, with field testing in some volunteer programs in 2018 and the exam's first administration in May of 2020. The 2020 Physician Assistant Education Association Presidents Commission chose to investigate the issues raised by a consensus-derived, PA-specific entrance exam to stimulate more informed discussion on the efficacy of such an exam. While it may have the potential to enhance efficiency in PA admissions and reduce variability in admissions requirements, a PA entrance exam would also likely introduce new challenges, including increased costs, impact on the diversity of the applicant pool, and incongruence with an increasingly holistic admissions process. The biggest barrier would likely be the lack of current consensus on the knowledge, skills, and attributes that matriculants need to be successful in the program and in clinical practice. Development of a consensus-derived PA entrance exam would be a complex, expensive, and time-consuming endeavor, requiring considerable attention to technical issues of psychometric quality, process transparency, and legal defensibility. Changes being made to health professions admissions practices due to the COVID-19 pandemic, including the dropping of test scores as a requirement by some institutions, may make some of the issues raised in this paper more timely than ever.","VanderMeulen, Stephane; Hills, Karen; Snyder, Jennifer A; Kohlhepp, William; Alexander, Lisa Mustone; Bowser, Jonathan; Lane, Steven",The journal of physician assistant education : the official journal of the Physician Assistant Education Association,10,1

There is limited evidence of PP effects on awake patients. This study aimed to investigate the effects and feasibility of PP on coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)-associated awake patients with ARDS in a subintensive setting of care. MATERIAL AND METHODS This is a single-center case-control study involving patients with severe COVID-19 infection. A total of 29 patients underwent noninvasive ventilation, and PP was initiated 12 h from admission; 18 patients tolerated prone and side positioning for at least 10 h/d and cycled their position every 2 h, and 11 patients had no complaints with PP. RESULTS A total of 29 patients (25 men and 4 women) with a median age of 64 years showed the average baseline white blood cell count of 8.45×109 cells/L, C-reactive protein of 10.1 mg/L, lactate dehydrogenase of 366 mU/mL, and interleukin-6 of 172 pg/mL. Basal pO2/FiO2 ratio (P/F) was 95 (±56.5) and showed no linear correlation with any of the inflammatory markers tested. Computed tomography findings included ground-glass opacities in 100% (29/29) of patients. Consolidation/atelectasis was found in 58% (17/29) of patients. P/F was homogeneously distributed at baseline in patients with PP (96.5) and without PP (95). P/F during PP increased significantly compared with noncompliant controls (288 vs. 202; p=0.0002). Total duration of respiratory failure was significantly shorter in patients with PP (14 vs. 21 days; p=0.002). The number of days to recover from respiratory failure inversely correlated with PP P/F independently from baseline P/F. CONCLUSION COVID-19 can lead to a severe impairment of gas exchange regardless of inflammatory status. Therefore, respiratory support may play a major role in COVID-19 treatment. We documented substantial efficacy of PP when started early and for at least 10 h/d. On awake patients, PP feasibility strictly depends on patient's compliance. The interface should be carefully chosen to best fit every patient.","Simioli, Francesca; Annunziata, Anna; Langella, Gerardo; Martino, Maria; Musella, Salvatore; Fiorentino, Giuseppe",Turkish thoracic journal,10,13

COVID-19 induces a massive release of proinflammatory cytokines, which drives COVID-19 progression, severity, and mortality. In addition, bronchial epithelial cells are the first pulmonary cells activated by coronavirus-2 (SARS-Cov-2) leading to massive cytokine release, which can hyperactivate lung fibroblasts, resulting in pulmonary fibrosis, a phenomenon observed even in moderate COVID-19 survivors. This in vitro study tested the hypothesis that Virlaza, a herbal medicine, could inhibit the hyperactivation of human bronchial epithelial cells (BEAS-2B) and pulmonary fibroblasts (MRC-5) induced by SARS-Cov-2. BEAS-2B (5x104/mL/well) and MRC-5 (5x104/mL/well) cells were co-cultivated with 1ml of blood of a Sars-Cov-2 infected patient for 4 hours and Virlaza (1ug/mL) was added in the first minute of the co-culture. After 4 hours, the cells were recovered and used for analysis of cytotoxicity by MTT and for mRNA expression of P2X7 receptor E iNOS. The supernatant was used to measure ATP and cytokines. Sars-Cov-2 incubation resulted in increased release of ATP, IL-1beta, IL-6, IL-8, and TNF-alpha by BEAS-2B and MRC-5 cells (p<0.001). Treatment with Virlaza resulted in reduction of ATP, IL-1beta, IL-6, IL-8, and TNF-alpha release (p<0.001). In addition, Sars-Cov-2 incubation resulted in increased expression of P2X7 receptor and iNOS (p<0.001), which has been reversed by Virlaza (p<0.001). In conclusion, Virlaza presents important anti-inflammatory effects in the context of Sars-Cov-2 infection.","Brandao-Rangel, M. A. R.; Melamed, D.; Silva-Reis, A.; Brill, B.; Zamarioli, L. d.

Methods: Data of 22 consecutive COVID-19 patients with severe respiratory failure whom were supported with ECMO were collected from computer-based hospital software retrospectively. Patients were treated in a single medical center between April 23, 2020 and February 14, 2021. Patients were analyzed from the points of laboratory and inflammatory markers, ventilation and ECMO features. Results: The ages of patients were between 30 and 69 years (mean age: 56.3±10.63). All patients were under maximum ventilator support, with the prone position. All patients had elevated levels of inflammatory indicators as D-dimer and ferritin. The mean level of ferritin was 1, 564±1, 611 ng/mL. D-dimer value was maximum 10.000 mg/mL (mean: 5, 215±3, 104), CRP increased to 177 mg/L (mean: 159±71). Percent of lymphocytes decreased as low as 2% (mean: 4.16±2.10). The mean duration of veno-arterial (VA) ECMO was 1.6±0.94 days whereas, for veno-venous (VV) ECMO, it was 10.05±5 days. VA ECMO was decided due to cardiovascular collapse. Four patients with VA ECMO survived a maximum of 3 days. Four of (22.22%) of 18 VV ECMO supported patient’s blood gas values were at normal ranges, 3 of them needed tracheostomy, and all of could be discharged from the hospital. Conclusion: Although, ECMO support for severe respiratory failure patients with COVID-19 is more challenging than regular ECMO applications, especially VV ECMO usage should be reminded as a remedy.","Ulukan, M.

We take a scenario-based approach to modelling potential interventions to assess relative changes rather than real-world forecasts. Specifically, we assess the effects of vaccinating those aged 16-17, those aged 12-17, and not vaccinating children at all relative to only vaccinating the adult population. Vaccinating children in the 12-15 age group would have had a significant impact on the course of the epidemic, saving thousands of lives overall in these simulations. In the absence of such a vaccination campaign our simulations show there could still be a significant positive impact on the epidemic (fewer cases, fewer deaths) by continuing NPI strategies in schools.

Especially challenging in places with sparse healthcare, limited diagnostic capacity, and public health infrastructure, syndromes with overlapping febrile presentations easily evade early detection. There is a clear need for evidence-based and context-dependent tools to make syndromic surveillance more efficient. Using published data on symptom presentation and incidence of 21 febrile syndromes, we develop a novel algorithm for aetiological identification of case clusters and demonstrate its ability to identify outbreaks of dengue, malaria, typhoid fever, and meningococcal disease based on clinical data from past outbreaks. We then apply the same algorithm to simulated outbreaks to systematically estimate the syndromic detectability of outbreaks of all 21 syndromes. We show that while most rare haemorrhagic fevers are clinically distinct from most endemic fevers in sub-Saharan Africa, VHF detectability is limited even under conditions of perfect syndromic surveillance. Furthermore, even large clusters (20+ cases) of filoviral diseases cannot be routinely distinguished by the clinical criteria present in their case definitions alone; we show that simple syndromic case definitions are insensitive to rare fevers across most of the region. We map the estimated detectability of Ebola virus disease across sub-Saharan Africa, based on geospatially mapped estimates of malaria, dengue, and other fevers with overlapping syndromes. We demonstrate ""hidden hotspots"" where Ebola virus is likely to spill over from wildlife and also transmit undetected for many cases. Such places may represent both the locations of past unobserved outbreaks and potential future origins for larger epidemics. Finally, we consider the implications of these results for improved locally relevant syndromic surveillance and the consequences of syndemics and under-resourced health infrastructure for infectious disease emergence.","Glennon, Emma E; Jephcott, Freya L; Oti, Alexandra; Carlson, Colin J; Bustos Carillo, Fausto A; Hranac, C Reed; Parker, Edyth; Wood, James L N; Restif, Olivier",,10,1

Our system extracts valuable insights from users from the perspective of offering suggestions to public health policy makers about what pandemic action is required in Afghanistan. The research goal of this study is to contribute insights about the scale of the issues and their solutions for COVID-19 by facilitating crowd engagement and discussing potential factors to address future policy-making issues. We methodically used social platforms to encourage participation from private citizens and invited health experts and patients into our discussion system in collaboration with Afghanistans Ministry of Public Health. ZOOM webinars were used to host discussions on Facebook and YouTube as a way to promote COVID-related collective social awareness. Our system mediates discussions with an unlimited number of participants and extracts the insights of their opinions in real time. It can also classify discussion insights into four elements and find the relationships among them: issues, ideas, merits, and demerits. We present various kinds of statistical information from 2,046 collected opinions of 1,101 participants by both identification of Al insights and human-conducted studies. Our discourse analysis categorized the discussion elements and peoples word-usage frequency in each group. We analyzed the word frequencies of each groups discussion data based on four types of extracted IBIS elements and extracted the most frequently used keywords. In a discourses IBIS analysis, we found that a solution proposed by one class was considered an issue by another class. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time in Afghanistan that a cross-class dialogue on COVID-19 has been organized using conversational Al as a representative application for public mediation and deliberation.","Haqbeen, J.; Ito, T.; Sahab, S.; Sato, T.; Okuhara, S.; Hofiani, M.",IEEE/WIC/ACM International Joint Conference on Web Intelligence and Intelligent Agent Technology (WI-IAT),10,16

Using bibliometric information to identify neglected taxonomic groups and potential viral reservoirs of zoonotic importance,11.538928,5.2949424,2020,"Background: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by a novel corona virus named SARS-CoV-2, has emerged as a global pandemic. Severe inflammatory process is one of main pathogenesis of COVID-19 and this involves cytokine storm along with overactivation of macrophage. On another front, cytokine storm with macrophage activation is frequently observed in various connective tissue diseases including dermatomyositis with positive antimelanoma differentiation-associated protein 5 (anti-MDA5) autoantibodies and adult Still's disease. Macrophage activation during inflammatory states is partially characterized by an increased serum ferritin levels and hyperferritinaemia and characteristics shared by the three diseases are a topic of interest to rheumatologists, however, no study has evaluated anti-MDA5-positive dermatomyositis and adult Still's disease in comparison to COVID-19. Objectives: The aim of this study was to highlight the homology and heterogeneity of COVID-19, anti-MDA5 dermatomyositis, and adult Still's disease by comparing clinical pictures of each disease in order to discuss their respective pathogeneses. Methods: We reviewed consecutive, newly diagnosed, untreated patients with COVID-19, anti-MDA5 dermatomyositis, or adult Still's disease. We compared their clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics, including the prevalence of macrophage activation syndrome and lung involvement in each disease. Results: The numbers of patients with COVID-19, anti-MDA5 dermatomyositis, and adult-onset Still's disease with hyperferritinaemia (serum ferritin ≥ 500ng/dL) who were included for main analysis were 22, 14, and 59, respectively. COVID-19 and adult Still's disease both featured hyperinflammatory status, such as high fever and elevated serum C-reactive protein, whereas COVID-19 and anti-MDA5 dermatomyositis both presented with severe interstitial lung disease and hypoxaemia. While two-thirds of the patients in each group met the criteria for macrophage-activated syndrome that is used in systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis, the HScore, an indicator of haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, was low in anti-MDA5 dermatomyositis and COVID-19 even in severe or critical cases. The findings of chest computed tomography were similar between COVID-19 and anti-MDA5 dermatomyositis (Figure 1). Conclusion: COVID-19 shared clinical features with rheumatic diseases characterised by hyperferritinaemia, including anti-MDA5 dermatomyositis and adult Still's disease. These findings should be investigated further in order to shed light on the pathogenesis of not only COVID-19 but also the aforementioned rheumatic diseases.","Kondo, Y.; Kaneko, Y.; Takei, H.; Tamai, H.; Takeuchi, T.",Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases,10,16

However, the transition to remote research has made it challenging for researchers to collect classroom data, observe teacher-student-technology interactions, and facilitate study sessions. To explore how researchers can effectively plan and conduct technology-based educational studies in the new, evolving classroom research environment, we interviewed seven US teachers, investigating their perceptions of participating in remote classroom studies. Based on the findings and the authors’ experience of running classroom studies, we propose a framework that educational technology researchers can refer to when planning and conducting research in the evolving classroom research environment. Specifically, the framework informs researchers of several types of questions they can explore with teachers, students, and researchers themselves to be better prepared to address potential confusion, unexpected issues, and practical benefits in remote classroom research. Our work contributes by providing a practical guide for running technology-based research remotely, which may remain as a means of classroom research in the future.

One of the most important issues in this situation is the adherence to self-quarantine behaviors and its psychological impacts on community health. To date, it is not clear how the Iranian medical students have been adapted with self-quarantine neither and their psychological impacts. The purposes of this study were to investigate effect of self-quarantine on medical student’s behaviors and their psychological health during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. Materials and Methods: During the early stage of the nationwide lockdown, a total 607 Iranian medical students (63.4% females, range 18-51 years), who were in self-quarantine, participated in an online cross-sectional survey. The valid and reliable questionnaires included covid-19 self-quarantine behaviors, general health (GHQ-28), and impact of events-revised (IES-R) were used to collect data. Series of analysis tests like t-tests, one way-ANOVA and Pearson's correlation coefficient were conducted via SPSS v.25. Results: The results indicated suitable behaviors (57.09±22.36) and higher-level of adherence in females and married students that there is no member in their family affected with COVID-19(P-value<0.05). Respondents exhibited significant levels of mental disturbance (29.33±16.11) and PTSD symptoms (28.96±15.40) and also Pearson correlation test indicated a significant positive correlation between self-quarantine behaviors with psychological disturbance and PTSD symptoms (r=0.208 and 0.215, P-value =0.01). Conclusion: Despite observing the appropriate behaviors in students during self-quarantine, but significant psychological effects due to self-quarantine condition have affected them. The results of this study can help professional health policy makers to determine special strategies for promoting appropriate behaviors during COVID-19 pandemic self-quarantine, controlling the resulting psychological impacts in medical students who considered as one the most important academic population. © 2021, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences.

Many cell-surface receptors recycle from endosomes to the plasma membrane via a recently discovered pathway, which includes sorting-nexin SNX17, Retriever, WASH and CCC complexes. Here we discover that PIKfyve and its upstream PI3-kinase VPS34 positively regulate this pathway. VPS34 produces PI3P, which is the substrate for PIKfyve to generate PI3,5P2. We show that PIKfyve controls recycling of cargoes including integrins, receptors that control cell migration. Furthermore, endogenous PIKfyve colocalizes with SNX17, Retriever, WASH and CCC complexes on endosomes. Importantly, PIKfyve inhibition causes a loss of Retriever and CCC from endosomes, and mutation of the lipid binding site on a CCC subunit impairs its endosomal localization and delays integrin recycling. In addition, we show that recruitment of SNX17 is an early step and requires VPS34. These discoveries suggest that VPS34 and PIKfyve coordinate an ordered pathway to regulate recycling from endosomes and suggest how PIKfyve functions in cell migration.","Giridharan, Sai Srinivas Panapakkam; Luo, Guangming; Rivero-Ríos, Pilar; Steinfeld, Noah; Tronchere, Helene; Singla, Amika; Burstein, Ezra; Billadeau, Daniel D.; Sutton, Michael A.; Weisman, Lois",bioRxiv,10,17

The formula virus and adjuvant in buffer saline solution was used as a vaccine. The safety and protective effectiveness of the developed vaccine was studied on Syrian hamsters. The results of the studies showed the absolute safety of the candidate vaccine on the Syrian hamsters. When studying the protective effectiveness, the developed vaccine with an immunizing dose of 5 mcg/dose of a specific antigen protected animals from wild virus at a dose of 104.5 TCID50/ml. The candidate vaccine formed virus-neutralizing antibodies in vaccinated hamsters in titers from 3.3 ± 1.45 log2 to 7.25 ± 0.78 log2, which were retained for 6 months (observation period) in the indicated titers. The candidate vaccine suppressed the replication of the wild virus in the body of vaccinated hamsters, protected against the development of acute pneumonia and ensured 100% survival of the animals. At the same time, no replicative virus was isolated from the lungs of vaccinated animals. At the same time, a virulent virus was isolated from the lungs of unvaccinated animals in relatively high titers, reaching 4.5 ± 0.7 lg TCID50/ml. After challenge infection, 100% of unvaccinated hamsters became ill with clinical signs (stress state, passivity, tousled coat, decreased body temperature and body weight, and the development of acute pneumonia), of which 25 ± 5% were fatal. The findings paved the way for testing the candidate vaccine in humans in clinical trials.","Zhugunissov, Kuandyk; Zakarya, Kunsulu; Khairullin, Berik; Orynbayev, Mukhit; Abduraimov, Yergali; Kassenov, Markhabat; Sultankulova, Kulyaisan; Kerimbayev, Aslan; Nurabayev, Sergazy; Myrzhakhmetova, Balzhan; Nakhanov, Aziz; Nurpeisova, Ainur; Chervyakova, Olga; Assanzhanova, Nurika; Burashev, Yerbol; Mambetaliev, Muratbay; Azanbekova, Moldir; Kopeyev, Syrym; Kozhabergenov, Nurlan; Issabek, Aisha; Tuyskanova, Moldir; Kutumbetov, Lespek",bioRxiv,10,28

Large granular lymphocytes (LGL) of both natural killer (NK) cell and cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) phenotypes were found to accumulate in livers of mice infected with either the nonhepatotropic Armstrong strain of lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV-ARM) or the hepatotropic WE strain (LCMV-WE). Between days 1 and 5 postinfection (p.i.), both viruses induced a three- to fourfold increase in NK cell lytic activity in the livers of C3H/St mice and a three- to fourfold increase in the number of LGL in the organ. These LGL were characterized as NK cells on the basis of cell surface antigens, kinetics of appearance, target cell range, and morphology. By day 7 p.i., virus-specific, H-2-restricted, Thy-1+, Lyt-2+, CTL activity was present in the liver, and its appearance correlated with a second wave of LGL accumulation. CTL activity, total leukocyte number, and CTL/LGL number were at least fivefold higher in the livers of mice infected with LCMV-WE than with LCMV-ARM. The dramatic LCMV-WE-induced day 7 increases in total leukocytes and LGL were absent in athymic nude (nu/nu) mice, suggesting that the increases were T cell-dependent. LCMV- ARM infection of C57BL/6 mice induced significant spleen CTL activity but little liver CTL activity, whereas LCMV-WE infection resulted in significant liver CTL activity but minimal spleen CTL activity. Mice infected with the cytopathic hepatotropic viruses, mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) and murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV), experienced much greater increases in liver NK/LGL by day 3 p.i. than did mice infected with LCMV or injected with the interferon-inducer poly(I-C). MHV-infected mice homozygous for the beige (bg/bg) mutation also exhibited significant increases in liver NK/LGL cell number and activity, although the activity was less than heterozygote controls, and the morphology of the LGL granules was aberrant. These data show that the LGL accumulate in virus-infected organs, in this case, the liver. An early NK/LGL influx is most pronounced during infection with cytopathic hepatotropic viruses. This initial influx of NK/LGL is followed later by an influx of CTL also possessing LGL morphology. The CTL/LGL response in the liver is significantly greater during hepatotropic virus infections, even when a strong CTL response in the spleen is lacking.",,J Exp Med,10,17

By the virus isolation to see the source of contamination, viruses were isolated from the feces of apparently healthy mice of ICR, CDF1, DBA/2 and C3H, and from human cancer cell line stocked in liquid nitrogen. In experimental infection, the isolates produced only mild hepatitis in ICR mice treated with cortisone. By cross-neutralization test, the nude isolate reacted closely with the virus from C3H mice but not with the virus from cancer cell line. The isolates from nude and C3H mice produced experimentally wasting disease with necrotic hepatitis in nude mice. These findings suggest that wasting disease in nude mice might be caused by low-virulent mouse coronavirus shed in feces from C3H mice introduced before the outbreak of disease.","Hirano, N; Ono, K",Zentralblatt fur Veterinarmedizin.

Before modem pharmaceuticals became readily available, mud-based emollients, salves, cold therapies, and other natural remedies were often used. Now we have effective therapies and are developing advanced topical analgesics as we learn more about the physiology and pathophysiology of pain. The use of topical analgesics may be associated with fewer patient systemic side effects than are seen with oral, parenteral, or transdermally administered agents, making the topical route of administration attractive to prescribers and patients. With further refinement of existing drugs and the development of novel agents, topical analgesics may offer relief for treating patient pain conditions that are currently challenging to treat, such as pain resulting from burns, wound debridement, and pressure ulcers. Recognizing the value of a multimodal approach, topical analgesics may offer a therapeutic option that can become part of a comprehensive treatment plan for the patient. With continued advancements in targeted drug-delivery systems, topical analgesics may be able to provide a method to prevent or reverse the phenomena of peripheral and central sensitization, or the neuroplastic changes believed to be responsible for the transition from acute to chronic pain states in patients. For those patients at risk for developing chronic pain states, such as complex regional pain syndrome, the combination of cutaneous stimulation (achieved through rubbing during application) and analgesic effects produced by the drug itself may prevent the disabling pain that often emerges during the subacute phase of disease. In summary, better utilization of currently available topical analgesics and continued research promise to ensure that topical analgesics are, and will continue to be, important tools in the treatment of patients with resistant pain.","Arnstein, Paul M",Postgraduate medicine,10,1

Identification of their function facilitates a mechanistic understanding of SARS infection and drug development for its treatment. The sequence of the majority of these putative proteins has no significant similarity to those of known proteins, which complicates the task of using sequence analysis tools to probe their function. Support vector machines (SVM), useful for predicting the functional class of distantly related proteins, is employed to ascribe a possible functional class to SARS-CoV proteins. Testing results indicate that SVM is able to predict the functional class of 73% of the known SARS-CoV proteins with available sequences and 67% of 18 other novel viral proteins. A combination of the sequence comparison method BLAST and SVMProt can further improve the prediction accuracy of SMVProt such that the functional class of two additional SARS-CoV proteins is correctly predicted. Our study suggests that the SARS-CoV genome possibly contains a putative voltage-gated ion channel, structural proteins, a carbon-oxygen lyase, oxidoreductases acting on the CH-OH group of donors, and an ATP-binding cassette transporter.

We identify an approach that allows selective activation of strongly Th1-dominated immune responses to protein antigens. Whereas in vivo administration of ovalbumin (OVA) induces cytokine synthesis that is neither Th1 nor Th2 dominated, administration of glutaraldehyde polymerized, high relative molecular weight OVA (OA-POL) leads to 20-fold increase in the ratio of interferon gamma (IFN-gamma)/IL-4 and IFN-gamma/IL-10 synthesis observed after short-term, antigen-mediated restimulation directly ex vivo. In contrast, concurrent in vivo administration of anti-IFN-gamma mAb and OVA or OA-POL results in marked increases in IL-4 and IL-10, and decreased IFN-gamma production, reflecting a polarization of the response towards a Th2-like pattern of cytokine synthesis. These observations may be useful in clinical settings including hypersensitivity, autoimmune diseases, and vaccine development where the ability to actively select specific patterns of cytokine gene expression would be advantageous.","Yang, X; Gieni, R S; Mosmann, T R; HayGlass, K T",The Journal of experimental medicine,10,19

The purpose of this study was to investigate the interesting enteric symptoms of the medical care workers who were evidently infected with SARS by means of respiratory transmission. STUDY Between May 1 and June 16, 2003, we enrolled 16 medical care workers who fulfilled the definition of probable SARS. Samples used for the detection of coronavirus RNA by RT-PCR were collected from throat and rectal swabs during acute phase. Serum anti-SARS IgG was checked by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays at the convalescent phase. RESULTS The incidence of watery diarrhea was 18.8% (3 of 16). The RT-PCR of coronavirus was positive in three (18.8%) of 16 throat swabs and in none (0%) of seven rectal swabs. Serum anti-coronavirus IgG was positive in 13 of the 15 patients (86.7%). The mortality rate was 6.25% (1 of 16). The diarrhea rate in our hospital was significantly lower in comparison with the 73% (55 of 75) of the Amoy Gardens outbreak in Hong Kong (P = 0.000073), and similar to the 19.6% (27 of 138) of the hospital-acquired outbreak in the Prince of Wales Hospital in Hong Kong (P = 0.798). In contrast to the high positive rate of feces RT-PCR (97%) in Amoy Gardens, our positive rate in rectal swab RT-PCT (0%) was significantly lower (P = 0.00000002). CONCLUSIONS Hospital-acquired SARS cases infected mainly by respiratory route less commonly presented with diarrhea. Lower intestinal viral load, when the virus spread by respiratory route, may be contributive to lower diarrhea rate and lower positive rate in rectal swab RT-PCR.","Chiu, Yi-Chun; Wu, Keng-Liang; Chou, Yeh-Pin; Fong, Tze-Vun; Tsai, Tung-Lung; Kuo, Chung-Mou; Kuo, Chung-Huang; Chiu, King-Wah; Liu, Jhien-Wei; Eng, Hock-Liew; Jawan, Bruno; Cheng, Yu-Fan; Chen, Chao-Long",Journal of clinical gastroenterology,10,1

Each has a broad species tropism and can cause disease with high mortality in both animal and human hosts. These viruses infect cells by a pH-independent membrane fusion event mediated by their attachment (G) and fusion (F) envelope glycoproteins (Envs). Seven Fabs, m101 to -7, were selected for their significant binding to a soluble form of Hendra G (sG) which was used as the antigen for panning of a large naïve human antibody library. The selected Fabs inhibited, to various degrees, cell fusion mediated by the HeV or NiV Envs and virus infection. The conversion of the most potent neutralizer of infectious HeV, Fab m101, to immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) significantly increased its cell fusion inhibitory activity: the 50% inhibitory concentration was decreased more than 10-fold to approximately 1 microg/ml. The IgG1 m101 was also exceptionally potent in neutralizing infectious HeV; complete (100%) neutralization was achieved with 12.5 microg/ml, and 98% neutralization required only 1.6 microg/ml. The inhibition of fusion and infection correlated with binding of the Fabs to full-length G as measured by immunoprecipitation and less with binding to sG as measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and Biacore. m101 and m102 competed with the ephrin-B2, which we recently identified as a functional receptor for both HeV and NiV, indicating a possible mechanism of neutralization by these antibodies. The m101, m102, and m103 antibodies competed with each other, suggesting that they bind to overlapping epitopes which are distinct from the epitopes of m106 and m107. In an initial attempt to localize the epitopes of m101 and m102, we measured their binding to a panel of 11 G alanine-scanning mutants and identified two mutants, P185A and Q191 K192A, which significantly decreased binding to m101 and one, G183, which decreased binding of m102 to G. These results suggest that m101 to -7 are specific for HeV or NiV or both and exhibit various neutralizing activities; they are the first human monoclonal antibodies identified against these viruses and could be used for treatment, prophylaxis, and diagnosis and as research reagents and could aid in the development of vaccines.","Zhu, Zhongyu; Dimitrov, Antony S; Bossart, Katharine N; Crameri, Gary; Bishop, Kimberly A; Choudhry, Vidita; Mungall, Bruce A; Feng, Yan-Ru; Choudhary, Anil; Zhang, Mei-Yun; Feng, Yang; Wang, Lin-Fa; Xiao, Xiaodong; Eaton, Bryan T; Broder, Christopher C; Dimitrov, Dimiter S",Journal of virology,10,9

HealthMap accumulates and assesses outbreak data from a range of sources, this includes news media (Google News (Arabic)), validated official alerts (WHO) and expert-curated accounts (ProMED). Search terms ""MERS"" and ""Coronavirus"" were used to search HealthMap for relevant alerts pertaining to MERS. The search terms were geographically limited to the Arab World and North African countries. Our results show that the prevalence of MERS still remains to be the highest in Saudi Arabia, however, between 9 September 2015 and 7 March 2015 there has been a slight overall trend in decreasing number of MERS related alerts within Saudi Arabia and the Arab world. All countries other than Saudi Arabia such as, UAE, Tunisia, Qatar, Oman, Lebanon, Kuwait, Jordan and Egypt together amounted for only 25.6% (n=214) of total MERS alerts (n=837).

Little is known, however, about the ways that systematic reviewers evaluate heterogeneity, especially in clinical specialties like oncology. We examined a sample of systematic reviews from this body of literature to determine how meta-analysts assessed and reported heterogeneity. A PubMed search of 6 oncology journals was conducted to locate systematic reviews and meta-analyses. Two coders then independently evaluated the manuscripts for 10 different elements based on an abstraction manual. The initial PubMed search yielded 337 systematic reviews from 6 journals. Screening for exclusion criteria (nonsystematic reviews, genetic studies, individual patient data, etc.) found 155 articles that did not meet the definition of a systematic review. This left a final sample of 182 systematic reviews across 4 journals. Of these reviews, 50% (91/182) used varying combinations of heterogeneity tests, and of those, 16% (15/91) of review authors noted excessive heterogeneity and opted to not perform a meta-analysis. Of the studies that measured heterogeneity, 51% (46/91) used a random-effects model, 7% (8/91) used a fixed-effects model, and 43% (39/91) used both. We conclude that use of quantitative and qualitative heterogeneity measurement tools are underused in the 4 oncology journals evaluated. Such assessments should be routinely applied in meta-analyses.","Holmes, Jonathan; Herrmann, David; Koller, Chelsea; Khan, Sarah; Umberham, Blake; Worley, Jody A; Vassar, Matt",Proceedings,10,15

We have also analysed if the implementation of TNO during the COVID-19 pandemic was beneficial in order to provide uninterrupted care to the patients with the limited resources available in these challenging times. METHODS All patients who underwent TNO guided biopsies or dilatation attempted over a 7 month period during COVID- 19 pandemic were included by searching the hospital and department database at The Royal Albert Edward Infirmary. A comparative group of patients who underwent panendoscopy over 9 months were included for comparison. Demographic data, histological diagnosis, second procedure and cost involved were recorded. RESULTS During this period, 20 TNO procedures (16 biopsies and 4 dilatations) were attempted which were compared with 20 panendoscopy procedures. The diagnostic accuracy of TNO biopsy for identifying benign and malignant pathology was 81.1%. The sensitivity and specificity for identifying malignancy was 76.9% and 100% respectively. The most common lesion location was laryngeal (43.8%) followed by oropharyngeal (37.5%), more specifically located at the tongue base. The median waiting period between the procedure being listed and TNO being performed was 5.5 days compared to 12 days for panendoscopy. There were 12/16 patients who did not require further interventions for histological diagnosis of the tumor. The TNO procedure was well tolerated with no complications and all were done under local anaesthesia as outpatient procedure without need for admission. TNO resulted in cost saving of £356 per case on a standard NHS tariff. CONCLUSION TNO is a valuable diagnostic tool for patients with suspected UADT malignancy and dysphagia and has proven to be an asset during the COVID-19 pandemic when we have to make the best use of the limited theatre time and resources. Also, the cost analysis showed that outpatient based TNO can provide significant cost savings for the current standard of care. Furthermore, it has shown better patient tolerability, lesser complications and shortened the time for diagnosis and hence starting timely treatment for these patients.","Goyal, M; McNally, G; Batra, A; Izzat, S; Pothula, V",The Medical journal of Malaysia,10,16

The psychometric Assessment included HDRS the HAS and the GAF scales. Free-T3, Free-T4, TSH, Thyroid Binding Inhibitory Immunoglobulins (TBII), Thyroglobulin antibodies (TA) and Thyroid Microsomal Antibodies (TMA) were measured in the serum. The Statistical analysis included 1 and 2-way MANCOVA, discriminant function analysis and Pearson Product Moment Correlation Coefficient. RESULTS All depressive subtypes had significantly higher TBII levels in comparison to controls. Atypical patients had significantly higher TMA in comparison to controls. No significant correlation was observed between the HDRS, HAS and GAF scales and thyroid indices. Discriminant function analysis produced functions based on thyroid indices, which could moderately discriminate between diagnostic groups, but could predict good response to treatment with 89.47% chance of success.

Recent works based on convolution neural networks have achieved good performance for this task. However, they are still limited in capturing structured relationships due to the nature of convolution. The shape of the pulmonary lobes affect each other and their borders relate to the appearance of other structures, such as vessels, airways, and the pleural wall. We argue that such structural relationships play a critical role in the accurate delineation of pulmonary lobes when the lungs are affected by diseases such as COVID-19 or COPD. In this paper, we propose a relational approach (RTSU-Net) that leverages structured relationships by introducing a novel non-local neural network module. The proposed module learns both visual and geometric relationships among all convolution features to produce self-attention weights. With a limited amount of training data available from COVID-19 subjects, we initially train and validate RTSU-Net on a cohort of 5000 subjects from the COPDGene study (4000 for training and 1000 for evaluation). Using models pre-trained on COPDGene, we apply transfer learning to retrain and evaluate RTSU-Net on 470 COVID-19 suspects (370 for retraining and 100 for evaluation). Experimental results show that RTSU-Net outperforms three baselines and performs robustly on cases with severe lung infection due to COVID-19.","Xie, Weiyi; Jacobs, Colin; Charbonnier, Jean-Paul; van Ginneken, Bram",ArXiv,10,1

The primary objective of this study was to investigate the safety and effectiveness of enoxaparin as a prophylaxis in patients undergoing distal, proximal, or total gastrectomy (TG) for gastric cancers. A total of 565 patients who underwent gastrectomy for gastric cancer were reviewed retrospectively. About 256 patients received postoperative prophylaxis with enoxaparin (2000 international unit twice daily for at least six days) and compression stockings; these patients were assigned to the enoxaparin group. About 257 patients comprised a historical control group, who used only compression stockings as a thromboprophylaxis. All patients underwent the same rehabilitation programs during the perioperative period. None of the patients developed symptomatic venous thromboembolism in either the enoxaparin group or the control group. The complication rate of bleeding was not significantly different between the two groups. Only one patient who used three antiplatelet agents concomitantly with enoxaparin required reoperation for anastomotic site bleeding. The usage of enoxaparin for venous thromboembolism prophylaxis is safe for Japanese patients after gastrectomy. But, cautious application is still needed especially when used concomitantly with other antiplatelet agents.","Yanagita, Takeshi; Kusanagi, Hiroshi",The American surgeon,10,26

The objective of this work was to characterize the IFN-alpha-producing cells (IPC) in tissues of TGEV-infected piglets. Caesarean-derived colostrum-deprived piglets were infected orally with the TGEV virulent Miller strain and IPC were characterized in situ by immunohistochemistry, using a rabbit anti-pig IFN-alpha antiserum. IPC were almost exclusively detected in intestinal tissues and mesenteric lymph nodes (MLN), as early as 6 h post inoculation (p.i.), with a peak at 12-18 h. They disappeared by 24 h. IPC were localized between enterocytes in the small intestine epithelial layer, in the lamina propria, around the Peyer's patches and, at highest frequency, in MLN. Very few IPC were present in the spleen and popliteal lymph nodes of infected piglets. Double immunohistochemical staining for IFN-alpha and leukocyte markers on MLN cryosections showed that IPC were mainly Swine Leukocyte Antigen (SLA) class II positive, and were not stained by an anti-macrophage (SWC3a) MAb. In addition, double staining with anti-TGEV and anti-IFN-alpha MAbs showed that viral antigens were present in MLN, close to IPC. These results show for the first time the presence of IPC in gut mucosa and gut-associated lymphoid tissues in response to an enteropathogenic virus. Moreover, this work shows that IFN-alpha released in serum is likely to originate almost exclusively from gut IPC triggered locally by viral antigens to produce IFN-alpha, since there were very few IPC in spleen or peripheral lymph nodes. MHC class II molecule expression by gut-associated IPC suggests that these cells may be the in vivo mucosal counterparts of the dendritic cells recently shown to produce IFN-alpha after in vitro viral induction.","Riffault, S; Carrat, C; van Reeth, K; Pensaert, M; Charley, B",Veterinary research,10,1

Venous angioplasty and stent placement has been progressively used to restore and maintain venous patency in PTS patients. This study reports our single-center experience with the use of endovascular treatment for chronic post-thrombotic symptomatic ilio-femoral venous obstructive lesions. METHODS A prospective mono-centric observational cohort study of PTS patients with chronic symptomatic ilio-femoral venous obstructive lesions referred for endovascular treatment was conducted from March 2012 to April 2016. Procedure consisted in recanalization, pre-dilation and self-expandable stenting of stenotic or occluded iliac and/or femoral veins. Severity of PTS, quality-of-life and treatment outcomes were assessed using Villalta scale and Chronic Venous Insufficiency Questionnaire (CIVIQ-20) at baseline and 3 months after the procedure. Imaging follow-up was based on duplex ultrasound (US) and computed tomography (CT). RESULTS Twenty-one patients (11 females, 10 males; median age, 41 years; range, 32-60) were included. Recanalization and stenting was successfully accomplished in all prime procedures, 4 patients benefitted from an additional procedure. Immediate technical success rate was 96% considering 25 procedures, performed without any complications. Median follow-up was 18 months (range, 6-30 months) with a 90.5% stent patency rate. Villalta score significantly decreased from baseline compared with 3 months after the procedure [14 (range, 11-22) and 5 (range, 1-10), respectively, P<0.0001], showing a significant decrease in the severity of PTS. CIVIQ-20 score significantly decreased from baseline compared with 3 months after stenting [48.5 (range, 39-73) and 26.5 (range, 21-45), respectively, P<0.0001] thus showing a significant improvement of quality-of-life. Post-procedural CIVIQ-20 score was significantly associated with Villalta score (95% CI, 1.53-2.95; P<0.0001). CONCLUSIONS Our results confirm the high clinical success rate and safety of endovascular PTS treatment and highlight the significant impact of stenting on the quality of life of patients with chronic symptomatic ilio-femoral venous obstructive lesions.","Falcoz, Marie-Tiphaine; Falvo, Nicolas; Aho-Glélé, Serge; Demaistre, Emmanuel; Galland, Christophe; Favelier, Sylvain; Pottecher, Pierre; Chevallier, Olivier; Bonnotte, Bernard; Audia, Sylvain; Samson, Maxime; Terriat, Béatrice; Midulla, Marco; Loffroy, Romaric",Quantitative imaging in medicine and surgery,10,9

The first influenza virus detection methods were based on its isolation in egg embryos or cell lines and on demonstration of the presence of the viral antigens. Molecular biology techniques associated with amplification of RNA improved the quality of tests as well as sensitivity of influenza virus detection in clinical samples.

The aim of the study was to investigate the cortisol and aldosterone response to adrenocorticotrophic hormone at altitude. Eleven subjects underwent a 250 μg short synacthen test at sea-level and again after trekking to 3 600 m in Nepal. Cortisol and aldosterone were measured by conventional assay from blood samples taken immediately prior to the administration of synacthen (T0) and then 30 (T30) and 60 (T60) min later. At 3 600 m resting basal cortisol and aldosterone levels were both significantly lower than they were at sea-level (p=0.004, p=0.003, respectively). Cortisol values at T30 and T60 were not different between sea-level and 3 600 m but the increment after synacthen was significantly greater (p=0.041) at 3 600 m due to a lower basal value. Aldosterone at T30 and T60 was significantly lower (p=0.003 for both) at 3 600 m than at sea-level and the increment following synacthen was also significantly less (p=0.003) at 3 600 m. At 3 600 m there appears to be a divergent adrenal response to synthetic adrenocorticotrophic hormone with an intact cortisol response but a reduced aldosterone response, relative to sea-level. This may reflect a specific effect of hypoxia on aldosterone synthesis and may be beneficial to acclimatization.","Mackey, J; Mellor, A; Watchorn, J; Burnett, A; Boot, C; Woods, D",Hormone and metabolic research = Hormon- und Stoffwechselforschung = Hormones et metabolisme,10,21

The manufacturer recommendation for all systems is for perpendicular deployment of these tacks into the tissue. Achieving this optimal angle with previously developed deployment systems is often challenging and can lead to tack failure, mesh migration, and recurrence, or may require the placement of additional ports. Additionally, current tack deployment systems lack the ability to reload, leading to increased cost when entire systems must be opened each time a reload is necessary. This article presents products designed to addresses both of these problems. These deployment instruments incorporate an articulating shaft or a hinge mechanism allowing for improved access to different parts of the abdominal cavity and delivering perpendicular placement of tacks with fewer port sites. Devices with the option of reloadable fixation decrease costs and reduce waste.","Moore, Alexandra M; Chen, David C",Surgical technology international,10,16

Various national apps with different technical design features have been commissioned and issued by governments worldwide. OBJECTIVE: Our goal was to develop and propose an item set that was suitable for describing and monitoring nationally issued COVID-19 contact tracing apps. This item set could provide a framework for describing the key technical features of such apps and monitoring their use based on widely available information. METHODS: We used an open-source intelligence approach (OSINT) to access a multitude of publicly available sources and collect data and information regarding the development and use of contact tracing apps in different countries over several months (from June 2020 to January 2021). The collected documents were then iteratively analyzed via content analysis methods. During this process, an initial set of subject areas were refined into categories for evaluation (ie, coherent topics), which were then examined for individual features. These features were paraphrased as items in the form of questions and applied to information materials from a sample of countries (ie, Brazil, China, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, Singapore, South Korea, Spain, and the United Kingdom [England and Wales]). This sample was purposefully selected; our intention was to include the apps of different countries from around the world and to propose a valid item set that can be relatively easily applied by using an OSINT approach. RESULTS: Our OSINT approach and subsequent analysis of the collected documents resulted in the definition of the following five main categories and associated subcategories: (1) background information (open-source code, public information, and collaborators); (2) purpose and workflow (secondary data use and warning process design); (3) technical information (protocol, tracing technology, exposure notification system, and interoperability); (4) privacy protection (the entity of trust and anonymity); and (5) availability and use (release date and the number of downloads). Based on this structure, a set of items that constituted the evaluation framework were specified. The application of these items to the 10 selected countries revealed differences, especially with regard to the centralization of the entity of trust and the overall transparency of the apps' technical makeup. CONCLUSIONS: We provide a set of criteria for monitoring and evaluating COVID-19 tracing apps that can be easily applied to publicly issued information. The application of these criteria might help governments to identify design features that promote the successful, widespread adoption of COVID-19 tracing apps among target populations and across national boundaries.","Weiß, Jan-Patrick; Esdar, Moritz; Hübner, Ursula",JMIR Mhealth Uhealth,10,24

Work up was done including echocardiography showing reduced ejection fraction. Later in the hospital course he developed acute renal failure and was treated with intermittent renal replacement therapy. No other definite cause of cardiorenal complications was identified during the course of the disease. A possible link with COVID-19 was considered with underlying mechanisms still needed to be explored. This case highlights the potential of SARS-CoV-2 affecting heart and kidneys.

This inefficient system takes 2 or more months to complete. Method: We designed and pilot tested the use of text messaging to report certain infectious disease symptoms in rural areas of northern Viet Nam. The project was divided into three 6-month phases carried out in two provinces. The current analysis focuses on the implementation of a two-way feedback system between Phases II and III, which aims at (1) evaluating whether this system improves efficiency by determining the number of correctly (vs. incorrectly) formatted text messages; (2) assessing this system's influence on accuracy by comparing text messages with their respective official paper-based documented forms; and (3) determining whether the amount of information required to report through text messages influences the efficiency and accuracy of the text messages. Results: Between Phases II and III, results revealed a significant improvement in correctly formatted texts in comparison to incorrectly formatted texts. As the number of fields required to report increased, the number of correctly formatted texts (efficiency) as well as the number of matched text messages (accuracy) decreased. Conclusion: Our research demonstrates that an automated error bidirectional feedback system can significantly improve both the efficiency and accuracy of a Short Message Service-based method for disease surveillance. Also, our data may suggest that two-way communication has better engaged health care staff to follow reporting protocols as well as to maintain accuracy from their clinic's own data.","Wong, Jordan A; Dang, Linh Thuy; Phan, Ngoc Tran; Le, Thuy Kim; Vu, Nguyen Cong; Vu, Thiem Dinh; James, Spencer; Katona, Peter; Katona, Lindsay; Rosen, Joseph; Wong, Frank Y; Nguyen, Cuong Kieu",Telemed. j. e. health,10,15

To alleviate the burden of data annotation, we herein present a label-free approach for segmenting COVID-19 lesions in CT via voxel-level anomaly modeling that mines out the relevant knowledge from normal CT lung scans. Our modeling is inspired by the observation that the parts of tracheae and vessels, which lay in the high-intensity range where lesions belong to, exhibit strong patterns. To facilitate the learning of such patterns at a voxel level, we synthesize 'lesions' using a set of simple operations and insert the synthesized 'lesions' into normal CT lung scans to form training pairs, from which we learn a normalcy-recognizing network (NormNet) that recognizes normal tissues and separate them from possible COVID-19 lesions. Our experiments on three different public datasets validate the effectiveness of NormNet, which conspicuously outperforms a variety of unsupervised anomaly detection (UAD) methods.","Yao, Qingsong; Xiao, Li; Liu, Peihang; Kevin Zhou, S",IEEE. trans. med. imaging,10,16

Whether they originated in Han or Daic people, there is no consensus. Three hypotheses have been proposed to explain the origin of this group: (1) the Han Chinese origin, (2) the ancient Daic origin, (3) and the admixture between Daic and Han. This study addressed this issue by analyzing the paternal Y chromosome and maternal mtDNA variation of 62 Fujian Tanka and 25 neighboring Han in Fujian. The southern East Asian predominant haplogroups (e.g., Y-chromosome O1a1a-P203 and O1b1a1a-M95, and mtDNA F2a, M7c1, and F1a1) had relatively high frequencies in Tanka. The interpopulation comparison revealed that the Tanka have a closer affinity with Daic populations than with Han Chinese in paternal lineages but are closely clustered with southern Han populations such as Hakka and Chaoshanese in maternal lineages. Network and haplotype-sharing analyses also support the admixture hypothesis. The Fujian Tanka mainly originate from the ancient indigenous Daic people and have only limited gene flows from Han Chinese populations. Notably, the divergence time inferred by the Tanka-specific haplotypes indicates that the formation of Fujian Tanka was a least 1033.8-1050.6 years before present (the early Northern Song dynasty), indicating that they are an indigenous population, not late Daic migrants from southwestern China.","Luo, Xiao-Qin; Du, Pan-Xin; Wang, Ling-Xiang; Zhou, Bo-Yan; Li, Yu-Chun; Zheng, Hong-Xiang; Wei, Lan-Hai; Liu, Jun-Jian; Sun, Chang; Meng, Hai-Liang; Tan, Jing-Ze; Su, Wen-Jing; Wen, Shao-Qing; Li, Hui",Hum Biol,10,22

Neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) are extracellular webs of chromatin, microbicidal proteins, and oxidant enzymes that are released by neutrophils to contain infections. However, when not properly regulated, NETs have the potential to propagate inflammation and microvascular thrombosis - including in the lungs of patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome. We now report that sera from patients with COVID-19 have elevated levels of cell-free DNA, myeloperoxidase-DNA (MPO-DNA), and citrullinated histone H3 (Cit-H3); the latter 2 are specific markers of NETs. Highlighting the potential clinical relevance of these findings, cell-free DNA strongly correlated with acute-phase reactants, including C-reactive protein, D-dimer, and lactate dehydrogenase, as well as absolute neutrophil count. MPO-DNA associated with both cell-free DNA and absolute neutrophil count, while Cit-H3 correlated with platelet levels. Importantly, both cell-free DNA and MPO-DNA were higher in hospitalized patients receiving mechanical ventilation as compared with hospitalized patients breathing room air.

Our understanding of the disease has evolved rapidly since the outbreak; disease prognosis is influenced mainly by multi-organ involvement. Acute respiratory distress syndrome, heart failure, renal failure, liver damage, shock and multi-organ failure are strongly associated with morbidity and mortality. The COVID-19 disease pathology is plausibly linked to the hyperinflammatory response of the body characterized by pathological cytokine levels. The term 'cytokine storm syndrome' is perhaps one of the critical hallmarks of COVID-19 disease severity. In this review, we highlight prominent cytokine families and their potential role in COVID-19, the type I and II interferons, tumour necrosis factor and members of the Interleukin family. We address various changes in cellular components of the immune response corroborating with changes in cytokine levels while discussing cytokine sources and biological functions.

A majority of respondents remained strongly concerned about environmental issues, such as climate change, while responses to sudden relaxations of environmental and food safety policies varied. We analyze the PFSS data to identify factors associated with concerns about pandemic and environmental regulatory changes. In general, we find that people whose food security has been threatened by COVID-19 remain concerned about relaxation of environmental regulations, and those most inclined to take steps to reduce spread of the virus, such as wearing masks and social distancing, are more concerned about relaxed regulations than those less willing to take mitigating actions.","Kecinski, Maik; Messer, Kent D; McFadden, Brandon R; Malone, Trey",Environ Resour Econ (Dordr),10,1

Its limitation or suspension, recursively extended over time, could be associated with a significant increase in the number of blind people worldwide. Indeed, cataract causes more than half of all cases of visual impairment in those countries with limited availability of means for performing eye operations (e.g., Africa or India). In this scenario, the pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) quickly resulted in the suspension or sharp reduction of various ophthalmic activities considered non-urgent, including lens replacement surgery or some intraocular injections. Despite the imperative need to continuously practice eye operations to avoid the abovementioned problems, there are currently little-shared and vague recommendations among the various countries on safety in operating rooms (for health care workers and patients) and poor legal protection for surgeons (potentially transmitting the COVID-19 infectious agent). Herein, we individuated and discussed some critical points in safety recommendations and medical liability. A paradigm shift for ocular surgery during the COVID-19 era is now mandatory. While telemedicine has been able to solve some problems in clinical ophthalmology, the lack of adequate health and legal protection for surgeons and patients may result in an excessive reduction in the volume of surgical interventions during a pandemic era and the immediately following period, thus determining inability to ensure health care to all patients.","Napoli, Pietro Emanuele; Nioi, Matteo; D’aloja, Ernesto; Fossarello, Maurizio",J.

KEY FINDINGS: Medical Imaging plays an important auxiliary role in the diagnosis of Covid-19 patients, mainly those most seriously affected. Practice differs widely among different countries, mainly due to the variability of access to resources (viral testing and imaging equipment, specialised staff, protective equipment). It has been now well-documented that chest radiographs should be the first-line imaging tool and chest CT should only be reserved for critically ill patients, or when chest radiograph and clinical presentation may be inconclusive. CONCLUSION: As radiographers work on the frontline, they should be aware of the potential risks associated with Covid-19 and engage in optimal strategies to reduce these. Their role in vetting, conducting and often reporting the imaging examinations is vital, as well as their contribution in patient safety and care. Medical Imaging should be limited to critically ill patients, and where it may have an impact on the patient management plan. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: At the time of publication, this review offers the most up-to-date recommendations for clinical practitioners in radiology departments, including radiographers. Radiography practice has to significantly adjust to these new requirements to support optimal and safe imaging practices for the diagnosis of Covid-19. The adoption of low dose CT, rigorous infection control protocols and optimal use of personal protective equipment may reduce the potential risks of radiation exposure and infection, respectively, within Radiology departments.","Stogiannos, N; Fotopoulos, D; Woznitza, N; Malamateniou, C",,10,30

The model was trained and optimized on the relative immunodominance of CTL epitopes in human immunodeficiency virus infection. Its accuracy was tested against experimental data from patients with COVID-19. Our model predicts that only some SARS-CoV-2 epitopes predicted to bind to HLA molecules are immunogenic. The immunogenic CTL epitopes across all SARS-CoV-2 proteins are predicted to provide broad population coverage, but those from the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein alone are unlikely to do so. Our model also predicts that several immunogenic SARS-CoV-2 CTL epitopes are identical to seasonal coronaviruses circulating in the population and such cross-reactive CD8+ T cells can indeed be detected in prepandemic blood donors, suggesting that some level of CTL immunity against COVID-19 may be present in some individuals before SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Gao, Ang; Chen, Zhilin; Amitai, Assaf; Doelger, Julia; Mallajosyula, Vamsee; Sundquist, Emily; Pereyra Segal, Florencia; Carrington, Mary; Davis, Mark M; Streeck, Hendrik; Chakraborty, Arup K; Julg, Boris",iScience,10,26

The unexpected number of people who have been infected with and died from coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is evidence that the pandemic has affected families and societies. The strong shock wave that has resulted in the international response has focused more on medical rather than psychosocial interventions. Little has been written or studied about the impact of COVID-19 on families. This article explores the impact of the COVID-19 quarantine on the mental health of families. We conducted 20 in-depth interviews with Jordanian families through snowball sampling.The results show that 20 interviewees described varied and new experiences. Many of the families we interviewed displayed symptoms of mental health problems, including disrupted sleep patterns, changes in eating habits, excessive digital media use, anxiety, depression, excessive smoking, stomach aches, bedwetting among children, and persistent headaches. The study also demonstrated the psychological stress partners felt during the lockdown due to their worries about job security. They also communicated their hope that renewed family commitments might bring more stability to their relationships. During the lockdown, family members spent more time together, and it became harder to conceal any issues from each other.The findings of this research demonstrate a critical need for social workers, and it is hoped that future legislation will include a role for social workers in various fields of crisis. Moreover, social workers should encourage families to ask for intervention to overcome the long-term effects that may result from COVID-19.

METHODS: The regional register for A&E admissions and hospitalizations has been reviewed in order to compare the number of A&D admission, the triage colour codes rates, aetiology of trauma, number of patients hospitalized for trauma, number of fractures that required surgery, type of fractures and injuries and mean patients' age. RESULTS: During lockdown 7314 patients were admitted in A&E, while 22,508 patients were admitted in 2019. In 2020 and 2019 triage codes were respectively distributed as follows: red code 0.1% vs 0.2%, yellow code 8.9% vs 6.3%, green code 84% vs 84.7% and white code 6% vs 8.8%. (p = 0.042). The number of hospitalized patients for trauma was 670 in 2020, while in 2019 was 1774 (p = 0.02). The most common fracture that required surgery was femur fracture (409 in 2020 vs 635 in 2019); fracture subtype distribution and mean age of the patients were significantly different in the two groups (respectively p < 0.01 and p = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: One month of lockdown showed a 68% decrease in the number of A&E visits and a 74% decrease of fractures that required surgery. Femur fracture showed the lowest decrease moving from 635 to 409 units but increasing their incidence rate (42 to 61%).","Aprato, Alessandro; Bini, Nathalie; Ferro, Silvia; Favella, Lucia; Conforti, Luigi; Massè, Alessandro",Ir. j. med. sci,10,16

In-office aerosol-generating procedures pose a risk to staff and patients while necessitating examination room shutdown to allow aerosol decontamination by indwelling ventilation. This review summarizes the current state of knowledge on portable high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) purifiers' effectiveness in eliminating airborne SARS-CoV-2 from indoor environments. DATA SOURCES: Medline, Embase, Cochrane Databases, and the World Health Organization's COVID-19 Global Literature on Coronavirus Disease. REVIEW METHODS: Data sources were systematically searched for original English-language published studies indexed up to January 14, 2021 per the following search strategy: (""HEPA"" OR ""High-efficiency"" OR ""High-efficiency particulate air"" OR ""Efficiency particulate"" OR ""Purifier"" OR ""Filter"" OR ""Cleaner"" OR ""Filtration"") AND (""COVID"" OR ""COVID-19"" OR ""SARS-CoV-2"" OR ""Coronavirus""). Additional relevant studies were identified by searching the reference lists of included articles. RESULTS: Eleven published studies have evaluated the effectiveness of portable HEPA purifiers in eliminating airborne SARS-CoV-2 with relevantly sized surrogate particles. Ten studies evaluated aerosols and submicron particles similar in size to SARS-CoV-2 virions. In all studies, portable HEPA purifiers were able to significantly reduce airborne SARS-CoV-2-surrogate particles. The addition of portable HEPA purifiers augmented other decontamination strategies such as ventilation. CONCLUSION: Experimental studies provide evidence for portable HEPA purifiers' potential to eliminate airborne SARS-CoV-2 and augment primary decontamination strategies such as ventilation. Based on filtration rates, additional air exchanges provided by portable HEPA purifiers may be calculated and room shutdown times potentially reduced after aerosol-generating procedures.","Liu, David T; Phillips, Katie M; Speth, Marlene M; Besser, Gerold; Mueller, Christian A; Sedaghat, Ahmad R",Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg,10,15

There have been many outbreaks of viral pneumonia with high contagiousness and mortality both in China and abroad, such as the great influenza in 1918, the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus in 2003, the Influenza A (H1N1) virus in 2009, and the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in 2012 and the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in 2019. These outbreaks and/or pandemic have significant impact on human life, social behaviors, and economic development. Moreover, no specific drug has been developed for these viruses. Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) plays an important role in the treatment of viral pneumonia during these outbreaks especially in SARS and SARS-CoV-2 because studies suggest that TCM formulations may target several aspects of the disease and may have lesser side effects than manufactured pharmaceuticals. In recent years, a lot of clinicians and researchers have made a series of in-depth explorations and investigations on the treatment of viral pneumonia with TCM, which have understood TCM therapeutic mechanisms more specifically and clearly. But critical analysis of this research in addition to further studies are needed to assess the potential of TCM in the treatment of viral pneumonia.","Xi, Shengyan; Li, Yunhong; Yue, Lifeng; Gong, Yuewen; Qian, Linchao; Liang, Tengxiao; Ye, Yong039; an,",Front Pharmacol,10,29

Yet rural communities-which make up tens of millions of people from diverse backgrounds in the United States-are among the nation's most vulnerable populations and may be less resilient to the effects of such a large-scale exogenous shock. We address this critical knowledge gap with data from a new survey designed to assess the impacts of the pandemic on health-related and economic dimensions of rural well-being in the North American West. Notably, we find that the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on rural populations have been severe, with significant negative impacts on unemployment, overall life satisfaction, mental health, and economic outlook. Further, we find that these impacts have been generally consistent across age, ethnicity, education, and sex. We discuss how these findings constitute the beginning of a much larger interdisciplinary COVID-19 research effort that integrates rural areas and pushes beyond the predominant focus on cities and nation-states.","Mueller, J Tom; McConnell, Kathryn; Burow, Paul Berne; Pofahl, Katie; Merdjanoff, Alexis A; Farrell, Justin",Proc.

Similarly, the U.S. also experienced a shortage of healthcare resources, which led to a reduction in the efficiency of the whole healthcare system. In order to evaluate this from a transportation perspective, it is critical to understand the extent to which healthcare facilities with intensive care unit (ICU) beds are available in both urban and rural areas. As such, this study aims to assess the spatial accessibility of COVID-19 patients to healthcare facilities in the State of Florida. For this purpose, two methods were used: the two-step floating catchment area (2SFCA) and the enhanced two-step floating catchment area (E2SFCA). These methods were applied to identify the high and low access areas in the entire state. Furthermore, a metric, namely the Accessibility Ratio Difference (ARD), was developed to evaluate the spatial access difference between the models. Results revealed that many areas in the northwest and southern Florida have lower access compared to other locations. The residents in central Florida (e.g., Tampa and Orlando cities) had the highest level of accessibility given their higher access ratios. We also observed that the 2SFCA method overestimates the accessibility in the areas with a lower number of ICU beds due to the ""equal access"" assumption of the population within the catchment area. The findings of this study can provide valuable insights and information for state officials and decision makers in the field of public health.","Ghorbanzadeh, Mahyar; Kim, Kyusik; Erman Ozguven, Eren; Horner, Mark W",,10,1

Methods This study summarized and reviewd the experience of interventional ultrasound for the diagnosis and treatment of three emergency patients in the department of ultrasound of our hospital during the COVID-19 epidemic, focusing on the screening of severe COVID-19 patients, the selection of indications for interventional puncture, the perioperative protection and postoperative management. Results According to epidemiological screening, patient 1 had close contact with the confirmed COVID-19 patient. Chest CT showed diffused interstitial exudation in the lower lobes of both lungs, and the patient was seen as a suspected case after consultation with the hospital expert group, who had retropharyngeal space infection on admission and needed to remove the infection focus quickly. COVID-19 was excluded in patient 2, who was diagnosed as acute episode of calculous incarcerated cholecystitis on admission, requiring rapid drainage of bile to relieve gallbladder obstruction. Patient 3 was excluded from COVID-19 and diagnosed as acute pericardial tamponade on admission, requiring rapid drainage of pericardial effusion. All 3 patients underwent strict COVID-19 screening procedures to identify the indications of interventional puncture. During the operation, tertiary protective measures were adopted for patient 1, and primary protective measures were adopted for the other two patients. Three severe patients were successfully treated by interventional ultrasound, with short average time, less bleeding and improved clinical symptoms. Conclusion Interventional ultrasound is minimally invasive, convenient and efficient, making it suitable for the emergency treatment during the COVID-19 epidemic. It can be used as an alternative to some emergency surgery, or provide a safe window period for confirmed or suspected severe COVID-19 patients. Our experience may provide a reference for the safe and effective practice of interventional ultrasound during the COVID-19 epidemic..","Hang, Zhang; Jia-Qi, Zhao; Sai, Zhang",Acad. J. Second Mil.

349998,349998,349998,A history of the mid-south sociological association,11.692074,5.426313,2020,"RATIONALE: Many hospitals were unable to accommodate the rapid surge of critically ill patients with COVID-19 requiring intensive care unit (ICU) admission in the spring of 2020. As a result, some patients were transferred to tertiary referral centers with increased surge capacity and an ability to provide a higher level of care for patients in respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation. In general, interhospital transfers have higher disease severity, longer length of stay, and higher mortality. Our study investigated whether patients with COVID-19 who were transferred to a tertiary referral center had higher severity of illness and poorer health outcomes compared to patients who were directly admitted. METHODS: This was a single center, retrospective cohort study of adult patients with COVID-19 who received mechanical ventilation. Demographic and clinical variables were extracted from the electronic medical record for patients admitted and discharged between March 17, 2020 and September 30, 2020. Patients were classified as either directly admitted or admitted via interhospital transfer. Inverse probability weighted regression models were constructed to test the association between transfer status and outcomes, including in-hospital death versus survival to hospital discharge, and number of days from intubation to discharge, adjusting for patient demographic characteristics and severity of illness. RESULTS: Of 1,785 patients admitted to Rush University Medical Center with COIVD-19, 174 (10%) were transferred from another hospital and 1,611 were directly admitted through the emergency department. A total of 119 transfer patients and 183 direct admits required mechanical ventilation. Transfer patients differed from direct admits in being more likely to have English as a preferred language (71% vs 56%,), younger age (median 57 vs 60 years), higher BMI (median, 34 vs 31), and more likely to have received ECMO (12% vs 3%), p&lt;0.01 for each. Overall,150 (42%) transferred patients and 78 (43%) directly admitted patients died prior to discharge, and there was no significant difference in in-hospital mortality after adjusting for patient sociodemographic factors and presentation severity. Additionally, there were no significant difference found between days from intubation to discharge between the two groups. CONCLUSION: Although transferred patients may have been sicker on arrival when compared to directly admitted patients, there were no differences in in-hospital mortality or length of stay in this study. These data suggest that interhospital transfer of critically ill patients with COVID-19 can be done safely and effectively.","McGowan, S.; Chen, E.; Johnson, T.; Longcoy, J.; Avery, E.; Lange-Maia, B.; Ansell, D.",American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine,10,24

But we can neither afford to insist on a zero-risk response, nor can we pretend that the risk does not exist. What is needed are tools to rationally triage the risk. To this end, we propose a novel 'risk index', which is the intersection of two components of risk: 1) the risk of an individual becoming infected due to action 'X'; and 2) the likely probability of death (or serious harm) if that individual develops CV19. The risk index allows risk to be compared across different scenarios, and may reveal that seemingly very different situations constitute similar degrees of risk. With risk measured in this way, one can then contrast different levels of risk against the social benefits of absorbing that risk, allowing actions to be sorted into those that are tolerable, debatable, or acceptable. While these concepts are presented in abstract based on approximate estimates of risk and influenced by our judgements about social desirability, the concept itself can be refined as more accurate approximations of risk and broadly accepted values of social desirability are derived empirically. In short, this is a tool intended to provide a useful empirical framework for rationale decision making about CV19.","Gill, Christopher J; Galea, Sandro",F1000Res,10,11

We aimed to assess the association between mtTKIs treatment and appearance of SMF on computed tomography (CT). METHODS: We performed retrospective evaluation of patients who started mtTKI treatment between 2016 and 2018, with a comparison patient cohort treated with single-target tyrosine kinase inhibitors (stTKIs). SMF amount for each gastrointestinal tract segment (stomach, duodenum, jejunum, ileum, terminal ileum, right colon, left colon) was scored as follows: 0 = none; 1 = low amount (<2 mm thick); 2 = high amount (>2 mm layer). For each CT, segment scores were aggregated to create an SMF index (SMFI). Maximal increase in SMFI between pretreatment and posttreatment CTs was documented. SMF â©¾3 was defined as positive. RESULTS: Forty patients treated with mtTKIs and 23 patients receiving stTKIs were included. Maximal increase in SMFI during treatment was 0-1 in 56/63 patients (89%) and 3-6 in 7/63 patients (11%). All patients with positive SMFI received mtTKIs compared to 0 patients treated with stTKIs (17.5% vs. 0%; p = 0.04). mtTKI treatment was associated with higher incidence of nausea/vomiting (4/7) and diarrhea (4/7) when positive SMF was noted, as compared to patients with negative SMF (6/33 patients each; p = 0.048). CONCLUSION: Gastrointestinal tract SMF deposition occurs in a considerable proportion of patients treated with mtTKIs with association to abdominal symptoms. This may be unique to mtTKIs and was not found in patients receiving stTKIs.","Tamir, Shlomit; Gavrielli, Shlomo; Abitbol, Chen; Tau, Noam; Grubstein, Ahuva; Neiman, Victoria; Yosef, Lilach; Atar, Eli; Zer, Alona",Tumori,10,20

A minority (13.0%) were admitted to a psychiatric hospital (10.0% informally, 3.0% under the Mental Health Act 1983).Approximately one in five (21.0%) patients re-attended to MHLS within 3 months. Out of 37 patients that had previously been assessed by MHLS in the preceding 12 months;37.8% were reassessed within 3 months (p &lt; 0.01).ConclusionIn the studied sample, most (90%) of psychiatric patients attended ED for self-harm or suicide, and a significant proportion had repeat attendance. Socioeconomic deprivation, substance misuse, relationship difficulties and stress due to the COVID-19 pandemic were major issues, alongside diagnosed depression and personality disorder. Focussed support for these issues may decrease ED attendance due to self-harm/suicidality.","Pandian, Haridha Kar Nilamadhab",BJPsych Open,10,24

However, since experiments are typically limited in duration, observed treatment effects are not always permanently stable, sometimes revealing increasing or decreasing patterns over time. There are multiple causes for a treatment effect to change over time. In this paper, we focus on a particular cause, user-learning, which is primarily associated with novelty or primacy. Novelty describes the desire to use new technology that tends to diminish over time. Primacy describes the growing engagement with technology as a result of adoption of the innovation. User-learning estimation is critical because it holds experimentation responsible for trustworthiness, empowers organizations to make better decisions by providing a long-term view of expected impact, and prevents user dissatisfaction. In this paper, we propose an observational approach, based on difference-in-differences technique to estimate user-learning at scale. We use this approach to test and estimate user-learning in many experiments at Microsoft. We compare our approach with the existing experimental method to show its benefits in terms of ease of use and higher statistical power, and to discuss its limitation in presence of other forms of treatment interaction with time.","Sadeghi, Soheil; Gupta, Somit; Gramatovici, Stefan; Lu, Jiannan; Ai, Hao; Zhang, Ruhan",,10,20

Ethiopia reported its first case on 13 March 2020 but has an accelerated case load and geographical distribution recently. In this article, we described the epidemiology of COVID-19 in Oromia Region, the largest and most populous region in Ethiopia, during the early months of the outbreak. METHODS: We analysed data from the COVID-19 surveillance database of the Oromia Regional Health Bureau. We included all reverse transcription-PCR-confirmed cases reported from the region between 13 March and 13 September 2020. RESULTS: COVID-19 was confirmed in 8955 (5.5%) of 164 206 tested individuals. The test positivity rate increased from an average of 1.0% in the first 3 months to 6.3% in August and September. About 70% (6230) of the cases were men; the mean age was 30.0 years (SD=13.3), and 90.5% were <50 years of age. Only 64 (0.7%) of the cases had symptoms at diagnosis. Cough was the most common among symptomatic cases reported in 48 (75.0%), while fever was the least. Overall, 4346 (48.5%) have recovered from the virus; and a total of 52 deaths were reported with a case fatality rate of 1.2%. However, we should interpret the reported case fatality rate cautiously since in 44 (84.6%) of those reported as COVID-19 death, the virus was detected from dead bodies. CONCLUSION: Despite the steady increase in the number of reported COVID-19 cases, Ethiopia has so far avoided the feared catastrophe from the pandemic due to the milder and asymptomatic nature of the disease. However, with the current pattern of widespread community transmission, the danger posed by the pandemic remains real. Thus, the country should focus on averting COVID-19-related humanitarian crisis through strengthening COVID-19 surveillance and targeted testing for the most vulnerable groups.","Gudina, Esayas Kebede; Gobena, Dabesa; Debela, Tessema; Yilma, Daniel; Girma, Tsinuel; Mekonnen, Zeleke; Woldie, Mirkuzie; Abdena, Dereje; Shume, Gemechu; Kenate, Birhanu; Lemi, Meles; Diriba, Dereje; Degfie, Tizta Tilahun",BMJ Open,10,8

Here, we describe an analysis procedure where genome composition and its variables are related, through the genetic code to molecular mechanisms, based on understanding of RNA replication and its feedback loop from mutation to viral proteome sequence fraternity including effective sites on the replicase-transcriptase complex. Our analysis starts with primary sequence information, identity-based phylogeny based on 22,051 SARS-CoV-2 sequences, and evaluation of sequence variation patterns as mutation spectra and its 12 permutations among organized clades. All are tailored to two key mechanisms: strand-biased and function-associated mutations. Our findings are listed as follows. (1) The most dominant mutation is C-to-U permutation, whose abundant second-codon-position counts alter amino acid composition toward higher molecular weight and lower hydrophobicity, albeit assumed most slightly deleterious. (2) The second abundance group includes three negative-strand mutations (U-to-C, A-to-G, and G-to-A) and a positive-strand mutation (G-to-U) due to DNA repair mechanisms after cellular abasic events. (3) A clade-associated biased mutation trend is found attributable to elevated level of negative-sense strand synthesis. (4) Within-clade permutation variation is very informative for associating non-synonymous mutations and viral proteome changes. These findings demand a platform where emerging mutations are mapped onto mostly subtle but fast-adjusting viral proteomes and transcriptomes, to provide biological and clinical information after logical convergence for effective pharmaceutical and diagnostic applications. Such actions are in desperate need, especially in the middle of the War against COVID-19.","Teng, Xufei; Li, Qianpeng; Li, Zhao; Zhang, Yuansheng; Niu, Guangyi; Xiao, Jingfa; Yu, Jun; Zhang, Zhang; Song, Shuhui",Genomics Proteomics Bioinformatics,10,27

Nevertheless, a previous zoonotic and highly pathogenic coronavirus, the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), is still causing concern, especially in Saudi Arabia and neighbour countries. The MERS-CoV has been reported from respiratory samples in more than 27 countries, and around 2500 cases have been reported with an approximate fatality rate of 35%. After its emergence in 2012 intermittent, sporadic cases, nosocomial infections and many community clusters of MERS continued to occur in many countries. Human-to-human transmission resulted in the large outbreaks in Saudi Arabia. The inherent genetic variability among various clads of the MERS-CoV might have probably paved the events of cross-species transmission along with changes in the inter-species and intra-species tropism. The current review is drafted using an extensive review of literature on various databases, selecting of publications irrespective of favouring or opposing, assessing the merit of study, the abstraction of data and analysing data. The genome of MERS-CoV contains around thirty thousand nucleotides having seven predicted open reading frames. Spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M), and nucleocapsid (N) proteins are the four main structural proteins. The surface located spike protein (S) of betacoronaviruses has been established to be one of the significant factors in their zoonotic transmission through virus-receptor recognition mediation and subsequent initiation of viral infection.

The case severity and fatality of COVID-19 are associated with excessive inflammation, namely, a cytokine storm. Metformin, a widely used drug to treat type 2 diabetes (T2D) mellitus and metabolic syndrome, has immunomodulatory activity that reduces the production of proinflammatory cytokines using macrophages and causes the formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs). Metformin also inhibits the cytokine production of pathogenic Th1 and Th17 cells. Importantly, treatment with metformin alleviates various lung injuries in preclinical animal models. In addition, a recent proteomic study revealed that metformin has the potential to directly inhibit SARS-CoV-2 infection. Furthermore, retrospective clinical studies have revealed that metformin treatment reduces the mortality of T2D with COVID-19. Therefore, metformin has the potential to be repurposed to treat patients with COVID-19 at risk of developing severe illness. This review summarizes the immune pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 and addresses the effects of metformin on inhibiting cytokine storms and preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection, as well as its side effects.","Chen, Xianyang; Guo, Huifang; Qiu, Li; Zhang, Chengdong; Deng, Qiang; Leng, Qibin",Front Immunol,10,10

Overall, 99% of respondents said that they would recommend the EMPIRE series to a colleague and 98% requested that the series continue after COVID-19 abates. Conclusions: The EMPIRE didactic series was well received, with the majority of participants positively endorsing its value. Further initiatives pertaining to virtual education for urology trainees should continue to be explored.","Smigelski, M.; Movassaghi, M.; Small, A.; Saji, A. A.; Badalato, G.

Currently, the World Health Organization (WHO) has recognized the novel coronavirus as the main cause of global pandemic. Patients infected with this virus generally show fever, nausea, and respiratory illness, while some patients also manifest gastrointestinal symptoms such as abdominal pain, vomiting, and diarrhea. Traces of SARS-CoV-2 RNA have been found in gastrointestinal cells. Further angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) the known receptor for the virus is extensively expressed in these cells. This implies that gastrointestinal tract can be infected and can also present them as a replication site for SARS-CoV-2, but since this infection may lead to multiple organ failure, therefore identification of another receptor is a plausible choice. This review aims to provide comprehensive information about probable receptors such as sialic acid and CD147 which may facilitate the virus entry. Several potential targets are mentioned which can be used as a therapeutic approach for COVID-19 and associated GI disorders. The gut microbiomes are responsible for high levels of interferon-gamma which causes hyper-inflammation and exacerbates the severity of the disease. Briefly, this article highlights the gut microbiome's relation and provides potential diagnostic approaches like RDT and LC-MS for sensitive and specific identification of viral proteins. Altogether, this article reviews epidemiology, probable receptors and put forward the tentative ideas of the therapeutic targets and diagnostic methods for COVID-19 with gastrointestinal aspect of disease.","Sonkar, Charu; Kashyap, Dharmendra; Varshney, Nidhi; Baral, Budhadev; Jha, Hem Chandra",SN Compr Clin Med,10,30

The person-to-person transmission of SARS-Cov-2 when in close contact is facilitated by respiratory droplets containing the virus particles, and by skin contact with contaminated surfaces. However, the large number of COVID-19 infections cannot be explained only by droplet deposition or contact contamination. It seems very plausible that aerosols are important in transmitting SARS-Cov-2. It has been demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 remains viable in aerosols for hours, facilitating rapid distribution of the virus over great distances. Aerosols may, therefore, also be responsible for so-called super-spreader events. Indirect evidence points to a correlation between ventilation and the transmission and spread of SARS-Cov-2, supporting ventilation as an important factor in preventing airborne transmission. Further actions to avoid transmission of COVID-19 include social distancing, hygiene measures, and barrier measures, such as face-coverings. Professional masks offer better protection than cloth masks. These protection measures are especially relevant to health care workers, when performing endotracheal intubation, but the risk from non-invasive ventilation and nebulizing treatment seems to be moderate.","van der Valk, Johanna P M; 039, In; t Veen, Johannes C C M",J Occup Environ Med,10,22

METHODS: Documents and international response communication from 4-31 January 2020 were reviewed and dates of responses were collected for descriptive analysis. A questionnaire was submitted to the DDC officers responsible for international coordination. A meeting to identify responses was held to evaluate the self-assessed capacities of the Department's international communication. RESULTS: Thailand began the COVID-19 screening protocol on 3 January 2020. International correspondence subsequently occurred continually either through the ASEAN or International Health Regulations (IHR) mechanisms. The total score of communication for international response was 88.9%. For IHR reporting duties, the median duration to respond was 2.49hours. Official news was sent within a mean of 9.18hours and the English daily situation reports were always uploaded onto the official website within 24hours.

Fewer than half of adults get a flu shot in the United States in a typical year, and a large minority of Americans say they will not get vaccinated against COVID-19. This resistance to vaccines creates challenges for both public health and the economy. The academic literature needs to consider potential policy solutions that might increase vaccination rates. In this study, we use experimental auctions to estimate how much university students need to be paid in exchange for agreeing to get a flu shot. These were real auctions where winners received compensation to get the flu shot. As found in prior research, the perceived stakes of such auctions incentivize participants to estimate the price at which they would engage in the auctioned behavior – in this instance, receiving a flu shot. We find that 50% require less than $1, and an additional 30% would get vaccinated for a payment of $20 or less. We also use a tobit regression to estimate bids as a function of participants’ demographic characteristics. If low levels of compensation increase vaccination rates, this has significant public health implications. The government may be able to achieve higher vaccination rates at a relatively low cost, particularly in comparison with the economic harms caused by illness. This study demonstrates that experimental auctions may be useful for estimating how much a larger, more representative sample would need to be paid in exchange for agreeing to receive flu or COVID-19 vaccinations.","Clark, Nick Corrigan Jay R.; Rousu, Matthew C.",Preventive Medicine Reports,10,26

The goal here was to determine the developmental profile of synaptic plasticity leading to L-LTP in the mouse hippocampus. Two mouse strains and two mutations known to affect synaptic plasticity were chosen: C57BL/6J and Fmr1-/y on the C57BL/6J background, and 129SVE and Hevin-/- (Sparcl1-/- ) on the 129SVE background. Like rats, hippocampal slices from all of the mice showed test pulse-induced depression early during development that was gradually resolved with maturation by 5 weeks. All the mouse strains showed a gradual progression between P10-P35 in the expression of short-term potentiation (STP), lasting &#8804;1 hr. In the 129SVE mice, L-LTP onset (>25% of slices) occurred by 3 weeks, reliable L-LTP (>50% slices) was achieved by 4 weeks, and Hevin-/- advanced this profile by 1 week. In the C57BL/6J mice, L-LTP onset occurred significantly later, over 3-4 weeks, and reliability was not achieved until 5 weeks.

L-LTP onset was not advanced in any of the mouse genotypes by multiple bouts of theta-burst stimulation at 90 or 180 min intervals.

Lipomas of the airway region are exceedingly rare, accounting for less than 1% of airway obstruction tumors. Correlation of radiographic findings from cone beam computed tomography (CBCT), multi-detector computed tomography (MDCT), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of a rare retropharyngeal lipoma has not been previously reported. CBCT studies acquired for implant and/or other diagnostic purposes may be the first line of detection as an incidental finding. CASE PRESENTATION: A 66-year-old female presented for a pre-implant CBCT with no history of other complaints or signs/symptoms. CBCT imaging depicts a large, well-defined, low-attenuation/soft tissue density lesion with an undulating appearance extending from the posterior left pharyngeal wall and occluding two-thirds of the airway from C2 to C4. The lesion extends laterally into the left parapharyngeal space and inferiorly beyond the field of view of the study. Evidence of faint internal septations was noted. The patient was immediately referred for an ENT consult. Laryngoscopy, MRI, and contrast-enhanced MDCT imaging were conducted to determine the full extent and nature of the lesion, as well as to potentially plan for biopsy and/or surgical resection. Removal of the lesion was successful, and histopathologic evaluation confirmed lipoma. Periodic follow-up was recommended to monitor for possible recurrence. DISCUSSION: The slower growth pattern of some benign lesions may obscure any symptoms as changes the patient may normally notice take place over an extended period. Furthermore, soft tissue lesions and especially those in the posterior midline, such as in this case, may not be easily visible on routine panoramic imaging or clinical exam, allowing for substantially large growth before detection. While the soft tissue contrast of the CBCT volume is poor, enough information was present to establish an initial differential diagnosis and the need for more advanced imaging modalities. With the growing popularity and adoption of CBCT in maxillofacial imaging, a thorough understanding of the appearance of hard and soft tissue lesions, as well as a strong understanding of the baseline appearance of normal anatomy, is important to ensure no incidental pathoses go undiagnosed.","Ehlers, Scott A; Bozanich, John M; Arashlow, Mehrnaz Tahmasbi; Liang, Hui; Nair, Madhu K",Int J Implant Dent,10,16

The most obvious and pressing challenge is taking care of acutely ill patients while managing spread of infection within the care facility, but this is just the tip of the iceberg if we consider what could be done to prepare in advance for future pandemics. Beyond the obvious need for strengthening medical knowledge and preparedness, there is a complementary need to anticipate and address the engineering challenges associated with infectious disease emergencies. Robotic technologies are inherently programmable, and robotic systems have been adapted and deployed, to some extent, in the current crisis for such purposes as transport, logistics, and disinfection. As technical capabilities advance and as the installed base of robotic systems increases in the future, they could play a much more significant role in future crises. This report is the outcome of a virtual workshop co-hosted by the National Academy of Engineering (NAE) and the Computing Community Consortium (CCC) held on July 9-10, 2020. The workshop consisted of over forty participants including representatives from the engineering/robotics community, clinicians, critical care workers, public health and safety experts, and emergency responders. It identifies key challenges faced by healthcare responders and the general population and then identifies robotic/technological responses to these challenges. Then it identifies the key research/knowledge barriers that need to be addressed in developing effective, scalable solutions. Finally, the report ends with the following recommendations on how to implement this strategy.","Hager, Gregory; Kumar, Vijay; Murphy, Robin; Rus, Daniela; Taylor, Russell",,10,26

Little is known about its clinicopathological features, prognosis and potential therapeutic strategies. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of postoperative radiotherapy (PORT) on patients with squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the breast. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed patients diagnosed with PSCCB in our center. All pathological slides were reviewed by an experienced pathologist to confirm the diagnosis. Furthermore, we searched the public database for patients with SCC of the breast. Then, we analyzed the clinicopathological features, treatment methods and patient outcomes. RESULTS: We identified 14 patients with primary SCC of the breast in our center. Additionally, 739 patients with SCC of the breast from the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) database were diagnosed between 1975 and 2016. Only 453 patients who underwent surgery were included in this study. Patients from the SEER database had a more advanced tumor node metastasis (TNM) stage than patients from our center. The median overall survival (OS) of all patients was 104 months (95% confidence interval [CI], 87.2-120.8 months), and the 5-year OS was 60.8% (95% CI, 56.1%-65.5%). Most of the patients (58%) tested negative for hormonal receptor expression. Multivariate analysis showed that PORT was an independent prognostic factor for OS. CONCLUSION: The results of our study demonstrate that SCC of the breast presents aggressive behavior with unique clinical characteristics. PORT improved OS significantly in patients with SCC of the breast. Longer-term studies are needed to confirm our findings.","Wang, Xuanyi; Zhang, Li; Luo, Jurui; Jin, Kairui; Yang, Zhaozhi; Meng, Jin; Zhang, Xiaomeng; Zhang, Zhen; Shao, Zhimin; Guo, Xiaomao; Chen, Xingxing; Yu, Xiaoli",Asia Pac. j. clin.oncol,10,30

While efforts to quickly identify effective antiviral therapies have focused largely on repurposing existing drugs1-4, the current standard of care, remdesivir, remains the only authorized antiviral intervention of COVID-19 and provides only modest clinical benefits5. Here we show that water-soluble derivatives of -tocopherol have potent antiviral activity and synergize with remdesivir as inhibitors of the SARS-CoV-2 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). Through an artificial-intelligence-driven in silico screen and in vitro viral inhibition assay, we identified D--tocopherol polyethylene glycol succinate (TPGS) as an effective antiviral against SARS-CoV-2 and {beta}-coronaviruses more broadly that also displays strong synergy with remdesivir. We subsequently determined that TPGS and other water-soluble derivatives of -tocopherol inhibit the transcriptional activity of purified SARS-CoV-2 RdRp and identified affinity binding sites for these compounds within a conserved, hydrophobic interface between SARS-CoV-2 nonstructural protein 7 and nonstructural protein 8 that is functionally implicated in the assembly of the SARS-CoV-2 RdRp6. In summary, we conclude that solubilizing modifications to -tocopherol allow it to interact with the SARS-CoV-2 RdRp, making it an effective antiviral molecule alone and even more so in combination with remdesivir. These findings are significant given that many tocopherol derivatives, including TPGS, are considered safe for humans, orally bioavailable, and dramatically enhance the activity of the only approved antiviral for SARS-CoV-2 infection7-9.","Pacl, Hayden Thomas; Tipper, Jennifer L; Sevalkar, Ritesh R; Crouse, Andrew; Crowder, Camerron; Institute, - UAB Precision Medicine; Ahmad, Shama; Ahmad, Aftab; Holder, Gillian D; Kuhlman, Charles J; Chinta, Krishna Chaitanya; Nadeem, Sajid; Green, Todd J; Petit, Chad M.; Steyn, Adrie JC; Might, Matthew; Harrod, Kevin S",,10,20

Despite the introduction of pneumococcal vaccines, IPDs caused by mucoid-type isolates are still prevalent. The present study aimed to characterize mucoid-type S. pneumoniae isolated from IPD patients throughout Japan in 2017 (post-vaccination era). METHODS: A total of 225 mucoid-type isolates were collected. The serotype, antimicrobial susceptibility, and multilocus sequence type of these isolates were determined. RESULTS: The prevalence of IPDs caused by mucoid-type isolates was high in adults, especially in the elderly (&#8805;65 years of age), and prognosis in these patients was significantly poor. Of the mucoid-type isolates, the predominant serotype was serotype 3 (84.4%), and the remaining were serotypes 37 (15.1%) and 8 (0.4%). Antimicrobial susceptibility showed that most mucoid isolates exhibited the penicillin-intermediate resistant S. pneumoniae genotype (gPISP). However, the serotype 3 isolate exhibited the penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae genotype (gPRSP). This gPRSP isolate was classified into ST166, which is related to serotypes 9 V and 11 strains. Sequence analysis of the capsule-coding regions and its flanking regions indicated that recombination occurred upstream and downstream of the capsule-coding region, suggesting that gPRSP (serotype 9 V/ST166) obtaining the type-3 capsule gene cluster resulted in the emergence of gPRSP (serotype 3/ST166). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicated that IPDs caused by mucoid-type S. pneumoniae are still a serious concern and mucoid-type S. pneumoniae with novel phenotype could emerge via capsular switching in response to environmental changes such as introduction of vaccines and improper use of antimicrobial agents.","Ubukata, Kimiko; Wajima, Takeaki; Takata, Misako; Murayama, Somay Y; Morozumi, Miyuki; Mukae, Hiroshi; Ishida, Tadashi; Miyairi, Isao; Kiyota, Hiroshi; Iwata, Satoshi",J. infect. chemother,10,1

Methods: Here, we employed a Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered-Dead (SEIRD) model to estimate the proportion of unreported SARS-CoV-2 cases in Italy from the reported number of deaths prior to the adoption of national control measures. Results: We estimated 115 894 infectious individuals (95% confidence interval (CI) = 95 318-140 455) and a total of 144 116 cases (95% CI = 119 030-173 959) on 20 March, 2020. These estimates resulted in 67.3% (95% CI = 60.3%-73.0%) unreported infectious individuals and in 67.4% (95% CI = 60.5%-73.0%) total cases. As such, given the substantial volume of undocumented cases, the case fatality risk would drop from an apparent 8.6% to an estimated 2.6% (95% CI = 2.2%-2.9%). Conclusions: Our findings partially explain the case fatality risk observed in Italy with a high proportion of unreported SARS-CoV-2 cases.

Now, we are entering the second phase of the pandemics in which the spread of the virus needs to be contained within the limits that national health systems can cope with. This second phase of the epidemics is expected to last until a vaccination is available or herd immunity is reached. Long-term management strategies thus need to be developed. METHODS: In this paper we present a new agent-based simulation model ""COVID-19 ABM"" with which we simulate 4 alternative scenarios for the second ""new normality"" phase that can help decision-makers to take adequate control and intervention measures. RESULTS: The scenarios resulted in distinctly different outcomes. A continued lockdown could regionally eradicate the virus within a few months, whereas a relaxation back to 80% of former activity-levels was followed by a second outbreak. Contact-tracing as well as adaptive response strategies could keep COVID-19 within limits. CONCLUSION: The main insights are that low-level voluntary use of tracing apps shows no relevant effects on containing the virus, whereas medium or high-level tracing allows maintaining a considerably higher level of social activity. Adaptive control strategies help in finding the level of least restrictions. A regional approach to adaptive management can further help in fine-tuning the response to regional dynamics and thus minimise negative economic effects.","Wallentin, Gudrun; Kaziyeva, Dana; Reibersdorfer-Adelsberger, Eva",Int. j. health policy manag,10,1

Although many diabetes technologies, such as insulin pumps and continuous glucose monitors, have been established, the data from these devices are rarely assessed. Furthermore, telemedicine has not been sufficiently integrated into clinical workflows. OBJECTIVE: We sought to remotely support children with type 1 diabetes and their caregivers, enhance the clinical outcomes and quality of life of children with diabetes, increase multiple stakeholders' engagement with digital care via a participatory approach, evaluate the feasibility of using an interoperable open-source platform in a university hospital setting, and analyze the success factors and barriers of transitioning from conventional care to digital care. METHODS: Service design methods were used to adapt clinical workflows. Remote consultations were performed on a monthly and on-demand basis. Diabetes device data were uploaded from patients' homes to an open-source platform. Clinical and patient-reported outcomes were assessed before, during, and after the COVID-19 lockdown period in Germany. RESULTS: A total of 28 children with type 1 diabetes and their caregivers enrolled in this study and completed 6 months of remote visits. Of these 28 participants, 16 (57%) also opted to attend at least one of their regular visits remotely. After 3 months of remote visits, participants' time in range (P=.001) and time in hyperglycemia (P=.004) significantly improved, and their time in hypoglycemia did not increase. These improvements were maintained during the COVID-19 lockdown period (ie, between months 3 and 6 of this study). Participants' psychosocial health improved after 6 months. CONCLUSIONS: Remote consultations and commonly shared data access can improve the clinical outcomes and quality of life of children with type 1 diabetes, even during challenging circumstances. A service design approach helped with the delivery of comprehensive and holistic solutions that accounted for the needs of multiple stakeholders. Our findings can inform the future integration of digital tools into clinical care during and beyond the pandemic.

The long-term pulmonary consequences of COVID-19, particularly in severe cases requiring ICU admission, are not known. The objective of the current study is to prospectively follow the pulmonary function of COVID-19 survivors who required ICU admission and compare outcomes amongst patients who needed high-flow oxygen (HFO), mechanical ventilation (MV) and extracorporeal life support (ECLS) for 1-year post-recovery. Osc is particularly sensitive to peripheral lung dysfunction and has been shown to identify lung disease earlier than conventional PFT. Thus, we will also compare Osc with conventional PFT in detecting respiratory dysfunction amongst the three groups. Methods: COVID-19 patients who survived ICU admission and were followed at the TGH post-recovery outpatient clinic are prospectively enrolled for quarterly Osc and conventional PFT. Demographic and clinical information are extracted from patients' electronic medical records. Results: From August 20-November 26, 2020, we enrolled 15 patients (12 M/3 F;mean age 53±15 years) who were 5.6±1.1 months post-infection. Conventional PFT showed restrictive defects only in the MV [%predicted total lung capacity (%TLC) =77±16, %predicted forced vital capacity (%FVC) =79±16, n=6] and ECLS (%TLC=71±14, %FVC=74±12, n=5) groups. Diffusing capacity and 6-minute walk distance were normal in all patient groups. In contrast, Osc was abnormal in all groups, particularly in the indices of peripheral airway obstruction and ventilatory inhomogeneity: R5-19 (difference in respiratory resistance between 5 and 19 Hz) and AX (area of reactance). The respective median (IQR) values for the HFO, MV and ECLS groups are as follows: R5-19 =1.47 (0.92-1.49), 1.02 (0.62-1.31), 1.29 (0.61-1.48) cmH2O.s/L (normal median range=0.11-0.66 cmH2O.s/L) and AX=12.65 (7.67-15.62), 10.83 (9.15-15.82), 14.32 (12.22-22.63) cmH2O/L (normal median range=2.11-5.79 cmH2O/L). Conclusion: Early findings in a cross-section of severe COVID-19 survivors revealed restrictive defects in the MV and ECLS groups when assessed by conventional PFT. However, abnormalities in respiratory mechanics were detectable by Osc in all patients suggesting that Osc may provide an early biomarker of subsequent lung function impairment. .","Jiang, A.; Wu, J.; Nohra, C.; Belousova, N.; Hantos, Z.; Ryan, C.

As the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) ravages the world, we have seen many perish in a short time. Many have died alone because of requirements for physical distancing. Even more will succumb as COVID-19 continues to spread. Moreover, deaths from other causes, numbering over 50 million annually, are also happening amid physical distancing and other COVID-19-related challenges. The pandemic is affecting the way terminally ill patients are being cared for, when and how people are dying of other causes, and how bodies are being handled and bereavement rituals performed. The bereaved are required to grieve without the support of usual social and cultural rituals. Grieving is further encumbered by cascading life stressors deriving from policies needed to mitigate the pandemic. Though we are often heartened by human resilience in response to death and other hardships, for some, the burden of this pandemic will be too much.

Recently, it was found that the IL-6 plays a vital role in the progression of COVID-19, which is responsible for the high mortality rate. In order to facilitate the scientific community to fight against COVID-19, we have developed a method for predicting IL-6 inducing peptides/epitopes. The models were trained and tested on experimentally validated 365 IL-6 inducing and 2991 non-inducing peptides extracted from the immune epitope database. Initially, 9149 features of each peptide were computed using Pfeature, which were reduced to 186 features using the SVC-L1 technique. These features were ranked based on their classification ability, and the top 10 features were used for developing prediction models. A wide range of machine learning techniques has been deployed to develop models.

An ONP sample was obtained following bilateral conjunctiva swabs in 85 subjects with a contact history or symptoms but unknown SARS‐CoV‐2 status and with no ocular symptoms or findings. The results were evaluated according to the patient's symptoms and how the swab was taken. The conjunctiva swab was positive in 29 (34.1%) cases and the ONP swab in 20 (23.5%) cases. Both methods produced positive results in 11 (14.1%) cases. The mean cycle threshold (C (t)) value was 30.15 ± 3.41 in symptomatic cases and 33.62 ± 1.76 in asymptomatic cases (p = .008). The mean C (t) value was 24.37 ± 3.48 when only the ONP swab was positive and 31.22 ± 1.99 when only the conjunctiva swab was positive. In cases that were positive by both methods, the mean C (t) value was 25.21 ± 4.94 for the ONP swab and 30.29 ± 5.05 for the conjunctiva swab. We found higher SARS‐CoV‐2 detection rates with the conjunctiva swab than the ONP swab in cases with unknown SARS‐CoV‐2 status in the early period. In addition, the conjunctival viral load seemed to be higher in symptomatic cases than in asymptomatic cases. We, therefore, believe a conjunctiva swab could be an alternative method to detect SARS‐CoV‐2 at the time of the first presentation to the outpatient department.","Gunduz, Ayten; Firat, Murat; Turkoglu, Gamze",J Med Virol,10,16

This proposes a bi-objective linear mathematical model comprising supply chain flexibility dimensions. The proposed model is to integrate environmental considerations into a flexible supply chain as an optimization framework. The first objective function is to minimize the costs, while the second one minimizes the environmental impacts of automotive industry. The goal of this paper is to find a trade-off between the total cost and the environmental pollution with regard to the supply chain flexibility dimensions. We suggest adding four different supply chain flexibility dimensions to the model which are budget for transportation, trained labor team to help the packaging process, number of active plants, and outsourcing the painting process flexibilities to curb harmful emissions from factories while reducing the costs. Six flexibility scenarios are proposed in this study to do the sensitivity analysis. The model is applicable with the use of a real data set derived from an automotive parts factory located in Iran. We use an improved augmented ε-constraint method to address the proposed bi-objective optimization framework. The results show that choosing the model with all flexibility dimensions is the best initiative to promote sustainable development, since it leads to a significant reduction in costs and environmental pollution.","Karimi, Sara Khorsandi; Naini, Seyed Gholamreza Jalali; Sadjadi, Seyed Jafar",Environ Sci Pollut Res Int,10,20

Histological changes, blood gases, bronchoalveolar lavage fluids (BALF) and wet-to-dry weight were analyzed to evaluate lung injury after smoke inhalation; beside, we also measured the expression of ACE and ACE2 at different time points to explore the possible mechanism of those changes. The results showed that pH of arterial blood, partial blood oxygen (PaO(2)) and blood oxygen saturation (SO(2)) decreased after smoke inhalation at different time points (P < 0.01); while, partial blood carbon dioxide (PaCO(2)), wet-to-dry weight ratio, leukocytes count, protein concentration and inflammatory cytokines in BALF increased after smoke exposure (P < 0.01). More importantly, both immunohistochemical staining and Western blot results showed that ACE and ACE2 expression in lungs from the experimental groups significantly increased compared with that of the control group (P < 0.05).

RESULTS: Results show that there is spatial variability in vulnerability based on environmental and socio-economic conditions. Districts of north and central India found more vulnerable then south India. Statistical significance has been tested using regression analysis and positive relation found in between vulnerability index and confirmed and active cases. CONCLUSION: The vulnerability index has highlighted environmental and socioeconomic backward districts. These areas will suffer more critical problems against COVID-19 pandemic for their socio-environmental problem.","Sarkar, Apurba; Chouhan, Pradip",Clin Epidemiol Glob Health,10,33

In this retrospective study, the authors reviewed data obtained from 236 animals, including buffaloes, goats/sheep, horses, carrier pigeons, rabbits, hens, snakes, pigs and cows that were screened for SARS-CoV-2 infection because they had been in contact with their SARS-CoV-2-positive breeder for at least 2 weeks. None of the tested animals were found to be positive. The authors' findings suggest that the risk of reverse zoonotic transmission among bred animals and SARS-CoV-2-positive breeders is very low or nonexistent.

The model includes immunization of susceptible people (S), quarantine (Q) of exposed people (E), isolation (J) of infectious people (I), a recovered population (R), and variation in population size due to natural births and deaths and deaths of infected people. It is shown analytically that the model has a disease-free equilibrium state which always exists and an endemic equilibrium state which exists if and only if the disease-free state is unstable. A simple formula is obtained for a generalized reproduction number [Formula: see text] where, for any given initial population, [Formula: see text] means that the initial population is locally asymptotically stable and [Formula: see text] means that the initial population is unstable. As special cases, simple formulas are given for the basic reproduction number [Formula: see text] , a disease-free reproduction number [Formula: see text] , and an endemic reproduction number [Formula: see text]. Formulas are derived for the sensitivity indices for variations in model parameters of the disease-free reproduction number [Formula: see text] and for the infected populations in the endemic equilibrium state. A simple formula in terms of the basic reproduction number [Formula: see text] is derived for the critical immunization level required to prevent the spread of disease in an initially disease-free population. Numerical simulations are carried out using the Matlab program for parameters corresponding to the outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in Beijing, Hong Kong, Canada and Singapore in 2002 and 2003. From the sensitivity analyses for these four regions, the parameters are identified that are the most important for preventing the spread of disease in a disease-free population or for reducing infection in an infected population. The results support the importance of isolating infectious individuals in an epidemic and in maintaining a critical level of immunity in a population to prevent a disease from occurring.","Siriprapaiwan, Supatcha; Moore, Elvin J.; Koonprasert, Sanoe",Math Comput Simul,10,10

They are unpleasant for patients and sometimes severe enough to cause hospital admission and death. Moreover, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, vulnerable populations with these disorders are at high risk, and their routine care cannot be done properly. Remote monitoring offers a low cost and safe solution for gaining visibility into the health of people in their daily lives, making it useful for vulnerable populations. OBJECTIVE: The primary objective is to assess the feasibility and acceptability of remote monitoring using wearables and mobile phones in patients with pulmonary diseases. The secondary objective is to provide power calculations for future studies centered around understanding the number of exacerbations according to sample size and duration. METHODS: Twenty participants will be recruited in each of three cohorts (COPD, IPF, and posthospitalization COVID). Data collection will be done remotely using the RADAR-Base (Remote Assessment of Disease And Relapse) mobile health (mHealth) platform for different devices, including Garmin wearable devices and smart spirometers, mobile app questionnaires, surveys, and finger pulse oximeters. Passive data include wearable-derived continuous heart rate, oxygen saturation, respiration rate, activity, and sleep. Active data include disease-specific patient-reported outcome measures, mental health questionnaires, and symptom tracking to track disease trajectory. Analyses will assess the feasibility of lung disorder remote monitoring (including data quality, data completeness, system usability, and system acceptability). We will attempt to explore disease trajectory, patient stratification, and identification of acute clinical events such as exacerbations. A key aspect is understanding the potential of real-time data collection. We will simulate an intervention to acquire responses at the time of the event to assess model performance for exacerbation identification. RESULTS: The Remote Assessment of Lung Disease and Impact on Physical and Mental Health (RALPMH) study provides a unique opportunity to assess the use of remote monitoring in the evaluation of lung disorders. The study started in the middle of June 2021. The data collection apparatus, questionnaires, and wearable integrations were setup and tested by the clinical teams prior to the start of recruitment. While recruitment is ongoing, real-time exacerbation identification models are currently being constructed. The models will be pretrained daily on data of previous days, but the inference will be run in real time. CONCLUSIONS: The RALPMH study will provide a reference infrastructure for remote monitoring of lung diseases. It specifically involves information regarding the feasibility and acceptability of remote monitoring and the potential of real-time data collection and analysis in the context of chronic lung disorders. It will help plan and inform decisions in future studies in the area of respiratory health. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ISRCTN Registry ISRCTN16275601; https://www.isrctn.com/ISRCTN16275601.

In this context, it has been reported that the lockdown and social distancing may have exerted an impact even on gambling behavior, not only by increasing gambling behavior in those affected by this disorder but even contributing to the occurrence of new cases. To explore such a possibility, we designed a cross-sectional web survey addressing a general population sample that lasted 3 weeks (March 23–April 20). Participants completed a survey including a demographic information section, a question regarding the presence of pathological gambling in the past and several questionnaires. These included the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), the Kellner's Symptom Questionnaire (SQ), and the version of The Yale Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale adapted for Pathological Gambling (PG-YBOCS) that investigated the presence of gambling behaviors in the last week. The final sample was composed by 254 subjects (112 males, 44.1%; 142 females, 55.9%). According to PG-YBOCS total score, pathological gambling has been found in 23.6% (n = 60) of the sample (53 males, 88.3%; 7 females, 11.7%), which is a high frequency compared to that reported by the existing literature. Among gamblers, 20.9% (n = 53) reported both past and current problem gambling (they have been defined as “chronic gamblers”), whereas 2.8% (n = 7) did not report to use gambling platforms in the past but only in the last week (defined as “new gamblers”). Data analysis showed a statistically significant difference between gamblers and people who do not gamble in age but not in education, and higher level of perceived stress, distress, and hostility in both chronic and new gamblers compared to those who did not report gambling behavior. A consistent proportion of business owners and unemployed individuals reported problem gambling during the lockdown period.","Salerno, Luana; Pallanti, Stefano",Front Psychiatry,10,8

Specifically, it analyzes the effects of different types of sport activities, including nature-based, natural resource-using, and nature-neutral sport activities and different types of environmentally sustainable behaviors such as recycling, ecological consumption, energy-saving, and mobility on subjective well-being. The study conducts comparisons between the period before the COVID-19 pandemic and during the first lockdown in Germany. Quantitative survey data were collected using a convenience sampling approach (n = 412). Sport activities were captured with the number of hours spent on nature-based, natural resource-using, and nature-neutral activities. Environmentally sustainable behaviors were measured across four areas, including recycling, ecological consumption, energy-saving, and mobility. Subjective well-being was measured using the scale of the World Health Organization (WHO-5). Differences between the periods before and during COVID-19 were analyzed using t-tests. A set of multivariate regression models were estimated with subjective well-being as the dependent variable and sport activities, environmentally sustainable behaviors, and socio-demographics as independent variables. The results show that nature-based and nature-neutral sport activities significantly decreased during the first COVID-19 lockdown, while environmentally sustainable behaviors increased. The regression analyses reveal that nature-based and nature-neutral sport activities as well as ecological consumption significantly added to individuals' subjective well-being in the pre- and during-COVID-19-period. A decrease in nature-based and nature-neutral sport activities significantly predicted a decrease in individuals' subjective well-being.

The extent to which these findings are generalizable to other settings is unknown. Coronavirus disease-2019 data from large, urban settings may be particularly difficult to apply in military medicine, where practice environments are often semi-urban, rural, or austere. The purpose of this study is compare presenting characteristics and outcomes of U.S. patients with COVID-19 in a nonurban setting to similar patients in an urban setting. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This is a retrospective case series of adults with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 infection who were admitted to Hershey Medical Center (HMC), a 548-bed tertiary academic medical center in central Pennsylvania serving semi-urban and rural populations, from March 23, 2020, to April 20, 2020 (the first month of COVID-19 admissions at HMC). Patients and outcomes of this cohort were compared to published data on a cohort of similar patients from the New York City (NYC) area. RESULTS: The cohorts had similar age, gender, comorbidities, need for intensive care or mechanical ventilation, and most vital sign and laboratory studies. The NYC’s cohort had shorter hospital stays (4.1 versus 7.2 days, P < .001) but more African American patients (23% versus 12%, P = .02) and higher prevalence of abnormal alanine (>60U/L; 39.0% versus 5.9%, P < .001) and aspartate (>40U/L; 58.4% versus 42.4%, P = .012) aminotransferase, oxygen saturation <90% (20.4% versus 7.2%, P = .004), and mortality (21% versus 1.4%, P < .001). CONCLUSIONS: Hospitalists in nonurban environments would be prudent to use caution when considering the generalizability of results from dissimilar regions. Further investigation is needed to explore the possibility of reproducible causative systemic elements that may help improve COVID-19-related outcomes. Broader reports of these relationships across many settings will offer military medical planners greater ability to consider outcomes most relevant to their unique settings when considering COVID-19 planning.","Lennon, Robert P; Demetriou, Theodore J; Khalid, M Fahad; Van Scoy, Lauren Jodi; Miller, Erin L; Dong, Huamei; Zgierska, Aleksandra E",Mil Med,10,32

In a previous work I have highlighted that the binding of the SARS-CoV spike proteins to the zinc-metalloprotease ACE2 has been shown to induce ACE2 shedding by activating the zinc-metalloprotease ADAM17, which ultimately leads to systemic upregulation of ACE2 activity. Moreover, based on experimental models, it was also shown the detrimental effect of the excessive systemic activity of ACE2 through its downstream pathways, which leads to “clinical” manifestations resembling COVID-19. In this regard, strong upregulation of circulating ACE2 activity was recently reported in COVID-19 patients, thus supporting the previous hypothesis that COVID-19 may derive from upregulation of ACE2 activity. Based on this, a reasonable hypothesis of using inhibitors that curb the upregulation of both ACE2 and ADAM17 zinc-metalloprotease activities and consequent positive feedback-loops (initially triggered by SARS-CoV-2 and subsequently sustained independently on viral trigger) is proposed as therapy for COVID-19. In particular, zinc-chelating agents such as citrate and ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) alone or in combination are expected to act in protecting from COVID-19 at different levels thanks to their both anticoagulant properties and inhibitory activity on zinc-metalloproteases. Several arguments are presented in support of this hypothesis and based on the current knowledge of both beneficial/harmful effects and cost/effectiveness, the use of chelating agents in the prevention and therapy of COVID-19 is proposed. In this regard, clinical trials (currently absent) employing citrate/EDTA in COVID-19 are urgently needed in order to shed more light on the efficacy of zinc chelators against SARS-CoV-2 infection in vivo.","Zamai, Loris",Cells,10,13

In this study, 3-week-old SPF PCV2-seronegative piglets were inoculated intranasally with PCV2. The effect of immunostimulation on the induction of PMWS was investigated by immunisation with keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH) emulsified in incomplete Freunds adjuvant. The study was terminated 5 weeks after inoculation. While disease was not observed in the age-matched controls, two out of five non-immunised PCV2-infected piglets died on postinoculation day (PID) 21, and one was euthanized on PID 25 in moribund condition. These animals had appeared lethargic with persistent fever from PID 12 onwards. The euthanized pig appeared smaller than littermates and suffered from jaundice. At postmortem examination, gastric ulceration, icterus, and liver and thymus atrophy were observed. Furthermore, histological lesions of degenerating hepatocytes and hepatitis in combination with lymphoid depletion and syncytial cells in lymph nodes were consistent with the diagnosis of PMWS. One out of five immunostimulated PCV2-infected piglets was euthanized on PID 22 with convulsions after a period with wasting. This pig was lethargic from PID 14 onwards with persistent fever from PID 8 and transient dyspnoea. No differences in clinical signs, gross pathologic or histological findings were observed for the remaining non-immunostimulated and immunostimulated PCV2-infected piglets. All 10 PCV2-inoculated piglets seroconverted to PCV2 within 14 days after inoculation. By virus isolation, quantitative polymerase chain reaction (Q-PCR), and immunostaining of cryostat sections, it was demonstrated that lymphoid tissue contained abundant PCV2 antigen. Viral DNA load in serum samples was assessed by Q-PCR. All four PMWS-affected piglets had high levels of PCV2 DNA in serum, suggesting that there was a correlation between high levels of viral DNA in serum and the development of PMWS. In conclusion, infection with PCV2 caused PMWS in SPF piglets, however, the immunostimulation did not seem to play a critical role.","Ladekjær-Mikkelsen, A.-S; Nielsen, J; Stadejek, T; Storgaard, T; Krakowka, S; Ellis, J; McNeilly, F; Allan, G; Bøtner, A",Vet Microbiol,10,16

METHODS: A total of 2830 valid questionnaires were collected as data for empirical analysis via network sampling in China. Structural equation modeling (SEM) was performed to explore the relationships between the latent variables. RESULTS: SEM indicated that social emotion significantly positively affected protective behavior and intention. Protective behavioral intention had significant direct effects on protective behavior, and the direct effects were also the largest. Government trust did not have a significant effect on protective behavior but did have a significant indirect effect. Moreover, it was found that government trust had the greatest direct effect on social emotion. In addition, we found that excessive risk perception level may directly reduce people’s intention and frequency of engaging in protective behavior, which was not conducive to positive, protective behavior. CONCLUSION: In the post-COVID-19 period, theoretical framework constructed in this study can be used to evaluate people’s protective behavior. The government should strengthen its information-sharing and interaction with the public, enhance people’s trust in the government, create a positive social mood, appropriately regulate people's risk perception, and, finally, maintain a positive attitude and intent of protection.","Shi, Guiqian; Zhong, Xiaoni; He, Wei; Liu, Hui; Liu, Xiaoyan; Ma, Mingzhu",Environ Health Prev Med,10,2

Spanish Society of Thoracic Surgery,11.648288,5.635556,2020-11-20,"Avian influenza A(H7N9) virus (A(H7N9)) emerged in February 2013. Liver impairment of unknown cause is present in 29% of patients with A(H7N9) infection, some of whom experience severe liver injury. Hypoxic hepatitis (HH) is a type of acute severe liver injury characterized by an abrupt, massive increase in serum aminotransferases resulting from anoxic centrilobular necrosis of liver cells. In the intensive care unit (ICU), the prevalence of HH is ∼1%–2%. Here, we report a 1.8% (2/112) incidence of HH in the largest single-centre cohort of ICU patients with A(H7N9) infection. Both HH patients presented with multiple organ failure (MOF) involving respiratory, cardiac, circulatory and renal failure and had a history of chronic heart disease. On admission, severe liver impairment was found. Peak alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) values were 937 and 1281 U/L, and 3117 and 3029 U/L, respectively, in the two patients. Unfortunately, both patients died due to deterioration of MOF. A post-mortem biopsy in case 1 confirmed the presence of centrilobular necrosis of the liver, and real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction of A(H7N9)-specific genes was negative, which excluded A(H7N9)-related hepatitis. The incidence of HH in A(H7N9) patients is similar to that in ICU patients with other aetiologies. It seems that patients with A(H7N9) infection and a history of chronic heart disease with a low left ventricular ejection fraction on admission are susceptible to HH, which presents as a marked elevation in ALT at the time of admission.","Zhang, YiMin; Liu, JiMin; Yu, Liang; Zhou, Ning; Ding, Wei; Zheng, ShuFa; Shi, Ding; Li, LanJuan",Emerg Microbes Infect,10,5

However, rare cases of vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia (VITT) and cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST) after viral vector vaccines (ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine, Ad26.COV2 vaccine) have been reported. Herein we systemically reviewed the reported cases of CVST and VITT following the COVID-19 vaccination. METHODS: This systematic review was performed according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement. We searched PubMed until May 19, 2021, and the following Keywords were used: COVID Vaccine & Neurology, AstraZeneca COVID vaccine, ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 COVID vaccine, AZD1222 COVID vaccine, Janssen COVID vaccine, Johnson & Johnson COVID vaccine, Ad26.COV2 COVID vaccine. The authors evaluated the abstracts and titles of each article for screening and inclusion. English reports about post-vaccine CVST and VITT in humans were collected. RESULTS: Until May 19, we found 877 articles with the searched terms. We found 12 articles, which overall present clinical features of 36 patients with CVST and VITT after the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine. Moreover, two articles were noted, which present 13 patients with CVST and VITT after Ad26.COV2 vaccine. The majority of the patients were females. Symptom onset occurred within one week after the first dose of vaccination (Range 4–19 days). Headache was the most common presenting symptom. Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) and/or Subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) were reported in 49% of the patients. The platelet count of the patients was between 5 and 127 cells×10(9)/l, PF4 IgG Assay and d-Dimer were positive in the majority of the reported cases. Among 49 patients with CVST, at least 19 patients died (39%) due to complications of CVST and VITT. CONCLUSION: Health care providers should be familiar with the clinical presentations, pathophysiology, diagnostic criteria, and management consideration of this rare but severe and potentially fatal complication of the COVID-19 vaccination. Early diagnosis and quick initiation of the treatment may help to provide patients with a more favorable neurological outcome.","Sharifian-Dorche, Maryam; Bahmanyar, Mohammad; Sharifian-Dorche, Amirhossein; Mohammadi, Pegah; Nomovi, Masood; Mowla, Ashkan",J Neurol Sci,10,16

As a new mechanism of clinician communication, electronic consultations (e-consults) may have downstream effects on care provision and coordination. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to understand primary care providers’ and specialists’ perspectives on how e-consults affect communication and relationships between clinicians. RESEARCH DESIGN: Qualitative study using thematic analysis of semistructured interviews. SUBJECTS: Six of 8 sites in the VISN 1 (Veterans Integrated Service Network) in New England were chosen, based on variation in organization and received e-consult volume. Seventy-three respondents, including 60 clinicians in primary care and 3 high-volume specialties (cardiology, pulmonology, and neurology) and 13 clinical leaders at the site and VISN level, were recruited. MEASURES: Participants’ perspectives on the role and impact of e-consults on communication and relationships between clinicians. RESULTS: Clinicians identified 3 types of e-consults’ social affordances: (1) e-consults were praised for allowing specialist advice to be more grounded in patient data and well-documented, but concerns about potential legal liability and increased transparency of communication to patients and others were also noted; (2) e-consults were perceived as an imperfect modality for iterative communication, especially for complex conversations requiring shared deliberation; (3) e-consults were understood as a factor influencing clinician relationships, but clinicians disagreed on whether e-consults promote or undermine relationship building. CONCLUSIONS: Clinicians have diverse concerns about the implications of e-consults for communication and relationships. Our findings may inform efforts to expand and improve the use of e-consults in diverse health care settings.","Anderson, Ekaterina; Vimalananda, Varsha G.; Orlander, Jay D.; Cutrona, Sarah L.; Strymish, Judith L.; Bokhour, Barbara G.; Rinne, Seppo T.",Med Care,10,20

Here we investigate if and how individual responses to a shared threat reflect those patterns of ideological difference. In seeming contradiction to the general association between social conservatism and pathogen avoidance, the more socially conservative political party in the United States has more consistently downplayed the dangers of COVID-19 during the ongoing pandemic. This puzzle offers an opportunity to examine the contributions of multiple factors to disease avoidance. We investigated the relationship between social conservatism and COVID-19 precautionary behavior in light of the partisan landscape of the United States. We explored whether consumption of, and attitudes toward, different sources of information, as well as differential evaluation of various threats caused by the pandemic—such as direct health costs versus indirect harms to the economy and individual liberties—shape partisan differences in responses to the pandemic in ways that overwhelm the contributions of social conservatism. In two pre-registered studies, socially conservative attitudes correlate with self-reported COVID-19 prophylactic behaviors, but only among Democrats. Reflecting larger societal divisions, among Republicans and Independents, the absence of a positive relationship between social conservatism and COVID-19 precautions appears driven by lower trust in scientists, lower trust in liberal and moderate sources, lesser consumption of liberal news media, and greater economic conservatism.","Samore, Theodore; Fessler, Daniel M.

Most serious respiratory manifestations are acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and pneumonia. By understanding the key aspects that can be used to differentiate between pediatric and adult respiratory compromise by COVID-19, we can improve our knowledge, and thus decrease the negative impact of the disease in the pediatric population.

By distinguishing contaminations generated by imported cases from those originating in the community, we are able to evaluate the contribution of importations to the dynamics of the disease in a community. We find that after an initial seeding, the role of importations becomes marginal compared to that of community-based propagation. We also evaluate the role of two travel control measures, quarantine and travel interruptions. We conclude that quarantine is an efficacious way of lowering importation rates, while travel interruptions have the potential to delay the consequences of importations but need to be applied within a very tight time window following the initial emergence of the variant.","Arino, Julien; Boëlle, Pierre-Yves; Milliken, Evan; Portet, Stéphanie",Infect Dis Model,10,22

Notably, graphitic carbon nitride (g-C(3)N(4)) is the most stable allotrope of carbon nitrides. It has been explored in various analytical fields due to its excellent biocompatibility properties, including ease of surface functionalization and hydrogen-bonding. Graphitic carbon nitride (g-C(3)N(4)) acts as a nanomediator and serves as an immobilization layer to detect various biomolecules. Numerous reports have been presented in the literature on applying graphitic carbon nitride (g-C(3)N(4)) for the construction of electrochemical sensors and biosensors. Different electrochemical techniques such as cyclic voltammetry, electrochemiluminescence, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, square wave anodic stripping voltammetry, and amperometry techniques have been extensively used for the detection of biologic molecules and heavy metals, with high sensitivity and good selectivity. For this reason, the leading drive of this review is to stress the importance of employing graphitic carbon nitride (g-C(3)N(4)) for the fabrication of electrochemical sensors and biosensors.","Idris, Azeez O.; Oseghe, Ekemena O.; Msagati, Titus A.

The similarity measure is one of the essential and advantageous tools to determine the degree of similarity between items. Several studies on similarity measures have been developed due to the importance of similarity measure and application in decision making, data mining, medical diagnosis, and pattern recognition in the literature. The contribution of this study is to present some novel spherical fuzzy similarity measures. We develop the Jaccard, exponential, and square root cosine similarity measures under spherical fuzzy environment.

L-OVE is a platform that maps PICO questions to evidence from Epistemonikos database. In response to the COVID-19 emergency, L-OVE was adapted to expand the range of evidence it covers and customised to group all COVID-19 evidence in one place. The search will cover the period until the day before submission to a journal.

We will include studies that assess patients with confirmed or suspected infection with SARS-CoV-2 and inform the relation of potential prognostic factors with death or disease severity. Two groups of two reviewers will independently screen studies for eligibility, extract data, and assess the risk of bias. We will perform meta-analyses and use GRADE to assess the certainty of evidence for each prognostic factor and outcome.

Results: For each microgram per cubic meter, the incidence rate increased by 1.3% regarding PM(2.5) and 0.9% regarding PM(10). There was no statistically significant relationship between the COVID-19 mortality rate and PM(2.5) or PM(10).

Telehealth is a viable alternative to face-to-face service delivery. Telephone calls alone, however, may be insufficient. Here, we evaluated whether supplementary telehealth via video-conferencing platforms could bring additional benefits to care-recipient with NCD and their spousal caregivers at home. PARTICIPANTS: Sixty older adults NCD-and-caregiver dyads were recruited through an activity centre. DESIGN, INTERVENTION: The impact of additional services delivered to both care-recipient and caregiver through video conference (n=30) was compared with telehealth targeted at caregivers by telephone only (n=30), over 4 weeks in a pretest-posttest design. Interviews and questionnaires were conducted at baseline and study's end. MEASUREMENTS, RESULTS: Supplementary telemedicine had averted the deterioration in the Montreal Cognitive Assessment evident in the telephone-only group (η(p)(2)=0.50). It also reversed the falling trend in quality of life observed in the telephone only group (QoL-AD, η(p)(2)=0.23). Varying degrees of improvements in physical and mental health (Short-Form 36 v2), perceived burden (Zarit Burden Interview Scale) and self-efficacy (Revised Caregiving Self-Efficacy Scale) were observed among caregivers in the video-conferencing group, which were absent in the telephone-only group (η(p)(2)=0.23–0.51). CONCLUSIONS: Telehealth by video conference was associated with improved resilience and wellbeing to both people with NCD and their caregivers at home. The benefits were visible already after 4 weeks and unmatched by telephone alone.

The goal of this study is to investigate the in vivo and in vitro inhibitory effect of cinnamon water extract (CWE) on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α and its underlying intracellular mechanisms. METHODS: CWE was orally administrated to mice for 6 days prior to intraperitoneal injection of LPS. Serum levels of TNF-α and interleukin (IL)-6 were determined 1 hour after LPS stimulation. Peritoneal macrophages from thioglycollate-injected mice were isolated and assayed for viability, cytokine expression and signaling molecules upon LPS stimulation. CWE was further fractioned according to molecular size, and the levels of total polyphenols and biological activities of each fraction were measured. RESULTS: The oral administration of CWE to mice significantly decreased the serum levels of TNF-α and IL-6. CWE treatment in vitro decreased the mRNA expression of TNF-α. CWE blocked the LPS-induced degradation of IκBα as well as the activation of JNK, p38 and ERK1/2. Furthermore, size-based fractionation of CWE showed that the observed inhibitory effect of CWE in vitro occurred in the fraction containing the highest level of total polyphenols. CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with CWE decreased LPS-induced TNF-α in serum. In vitro inhibition of TNF-α gene by CWE may occur via the modulation of IκBα degradation and JNK, p38, and ERK1/2 activation. Our results also indicate that the observed anti-inflammatory action of CWE may originate from the presence of polyphenols.","Hong, Joung-Woo; Yang, Ga-Eun; Kim, Yoon Bum; Eom, Seok Hyun; Lew, Jae-Hwan; Kang, Hee",BMC Complement Altern Med,10,2

Data regarding the host response within the lung are sparse. The objective is to compare alveolar and systemic inflammation response patterns, mitochondrial alarmin release, and outcomes according to ARDS etiology (i.e., COVID-19 vs. non-COVID-19). METHODS: Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and plasma were obtained from 7 control, 7 non-COVID-19 ARDS, and 14 COVID-19 ARDS patients. Clinical data, plasma, and epithelial lining fluid (ELF) concentrations of 45 inflammatory mediators and cell-free mitochondrial DNA were measured and compared. RESULTS: COVID-19 ARDS patients required mechanical ventilation (MV) for significantly longer, even after adjustment for potential confounders. There was a trend toward higher concentrations of plasma CCL5, CXCL2, CXCL10, CD40 ligand, IL-10, and GM-CSF, and ELF concentrations of CXCL1, CXCL10, granzyme B, TRAIL, and EGF in the COVID-19 ARDS group compared with the non-COVID-19 ARDS group. Plasma and ELF CXCL10 concentrations were independently associated with the number of ventilator-free days, without correlation between ELF CXCL-10 and viral load. Mitochondrial DNA plasma and ELF concentrations were elevated in all ARDS patients, with no differences between the two groups. ELF concentrations of mitochondrial DNA were correlated with alveolar cell counts, as well as IL-8 and IL-1β concentrations. CONCLUSION: CXCL10 could be one key mediator involved in the dysregulated immune response. It should be evaluated as a candidate biomarker that may predict the duration of MV in COVID-19 ARDS patients. Targeting the CXCL10-CXCR3 axis could also be considered as a new therapeutic approach.

These conversions contain alterations or disruptions of the tight and adherens junctions between cells as part of their pathogenesis, and reorganise cellular microfilaments that initiate, sustain and spread the viral infections and so on. Using porcine epidemic diarrhoea virus (PEDV), transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) and a model of normal intestinal epithelial cells (IPEC-J2), we researched the interaction between tight and adherens junctions and microfilaments of IPEC-J2 cells with these viruses. In our work, the results showed that IPEC-J2 cells were susceptible to TGEV and PEDV infection. And TGEV could impair the barrier integrity of IPEC-J2 cells at early stages of infection through down-regulating some proteins of tight and adherens junctions, while PEDV cloud cause a slight of damage in the integrity of epithelial barrier. In addition, they also could affect the microfilaments remodelling of IPEC-J2 cells, and the drug-interfered microfilaments could inhibit viral replication and release. Furthermore, PEDV + TGEV co-infection was more aggravating to damage of tight junctions and remodelling of microfilaments than their single infection. Finally, the PEDV and TGEV infection affected the MAPK pathway, and inhibition of MAPK pathway regulated the changes of tight junctions and microfilaments of cells. These studies provide a new insight from the perspective of the epithelial barrier and microfilaments into the pathogenesis of PEDV and TGEV.","Zhao, Shanshan; Gao, Junkai; Zhu, Liqi; Yang, Qian",Virus Res,10,4

In this paper, I discuss that emerging literature on gender inequalities in pandemic academic productivity. I reflect on the questions asked, the issues centered and the assumptions made within this literature, devoting particular attention to how authors conceptualize academic labor and productivity, on one hand, and gender, on the other. I show that this literature makes major contributions to exposing old and new gender inequalities in academia, but argue that it also risks reproducing some problematic assumptions about gender and about academic work.

Others believe that conventional viruses, which replicate by virtue of their nucleic acid-defined genes, are involved in the causation and progression of the encephalopathies but that technical problems have prevented their identification. Others postulate even more exotic causative agents. While this paper will particularly address the possibility of a viral aetiology for these diseases, it is also emphasized that our knowledge of the state of the immune system in animals with encephalopathy needs broadening. There are remarkable gaps in our knowledge of the histopathology of these diseases, particularly the nature of the characteristic vacuoles.

Since its emergence in December 2019, the virus has infected millions of people, caused the deaths of hundreds of thousands, and resulted in incalculable social and economic damage. Understanding the infectivity and transmission dynamics of the virus is essential to determine how best to reduce mortality while ensuring minimal social restrictions on the lives of the general population. Anecdotal evidence is available, but detailed studies have not yet revealed whether infection with the virus results in immunity. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to use mathematical modeling to investigate the reinfection frequency of COVID-19. METHODS: We have used the SIR (Susceptible, Infected, Recovered) framework and random processing based on empirical SARS-CoV-2 infection and fatality data from different regions to calculate the number of reinfections that would be expected to occur if no immunity to the disease occurred. RESULTS: Our model predicts that cases of reinfection should have been observed by now if primary SARS-CoV-2 infection did not protect individuals from subsequent exposure in the short term; however, no such cases have been documented. CONCLUSIONS: This work concludes that infection with SARS-CoV-2 provides short-term immunity to reinfection and therefore offers useful insight for serological testing strategies, lockdown easing, and vaccine development.","McMahon, Andrew; Robb, Nicole C",JMIR Public Health Surveill,10,16

Measurements of communities’ mask use behavior have mostly relied on self-report. This study’s objective was to devise a method to measure the prevalence of improper mask use and no mask use in indoor public areas without relying on self-report. A stratified random sample of retail trade stores (public areas) in Louisville, Kentucky, USA, was selected and targeted for observation by trained surveyors during December 14–20, 2020. The stratification allowed for investigating mask use behavior by city district, retail trade group, and public area size. The total number of visited public areas was 382 where mask use behavior of 2,080 visitors and 1,510 staff were observed. The average prevalence of mask use among observed visitors was 96%, while the average prevalence of proper use was 86%. In 48% of the public areas, at least one improperly masked visitor was observed and in 17% at least one unmasked visitor was observed. The average prevalence of proper mask use among staff was 87%, similar to the average among visitors. However, the percentage of public areas where at least one improperly masked staff was observed was 33. Significant disparities in mask use and its proper use were observed among both visitors and staff by public area size, retail trade type, and geographical area.

Ocean-based mitigation actions could contribute 12% of the emissions reductions required by 2030 to keep warming to less than 1.5 ºC but, because substantial warming is already locked in, extensive adaptation action is also needed. Here, as part of the Future Seas project, we use a “foresighting/hindcasting” technique to describe two scenarios for 2030 in the context of climate change mitigation and adaptation for ocean systems.

Our findings indicate that among the self-employed, who generally face a higher likelihood of income losses due to COVID-19 than employees, women are about one-third more likely to experience income losses than their male counterparts. We do not find a comparable gender gap among employees. Our results further suggest that the gender gap among the self-employed is largely explained by the fact that women disproportionately work in industries that are more severely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. Our analysis of potential mechanisms reveals that women are significantly more likely to be impacted by government-imposed restrictions, e.g., the regulation of opening hours.

Although several studies have discussed the role of 5-lipoxygenase (5-LOX) in viral infections, such as influenzae and SARS, it remains unexplored in the pathophysiology of COVID-19. 5-LOX acts on free arachidonic acid (AA) to form proinflammatory leukotrienes (LTs). Of note, numerous cells involved with COVID-19 (e.g., inflammatory and smooth muscle cells, platelets, and vascular endothelium) widely express leukotriene receptors. Moreover, 5-LOX metabolites induce the release of cytokines (e.g., tumour necrosis factor-α [TNF-α], interleukin-1α [IL-1α], and interleukin-1β [IL-1β]) and express tissue factor on cell membranes and activate plasmin. Since macrophages, monocytes, neutrophils, and eosinophils can express lipoxygenases, activation of 5-LOX and the subsequent release of LTs may contribute to the severity of COVID-19.

METHODS: We performed a literature search to answer four key questions. The committee graded the evidence and developed recommendations by using Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation methodology. QUESTIONS ADDRESSED BY THE GUIDELINE AND RECOMMENDATIONS: We assessed evidence on the risk of bacterial infections in hospitalized COVID-19 patients, the associated bacterial pathogens, how to diagnose bacterial infections and how to treat bacterial infections. Bacterial co-infection upon admission was reported in 3.5% of COVID-19 patients, while bacterial secondary infections during hospitalization occurred up to 15%. No or very low quality evidence was found to answer the other key clinical questions. Although the evidence base on bacterial infections in COVID-19 is currently limited, available evidence supports restrictive antibiotic use from an antibiotic stewardship perspective, especially upon admission. To support restrictive antibiotic use, maximum efforts should be undertaken to obtain sputum and blood culture samples as well as pneumococcal urinary antigen testing. We suggest to stop antibiotics in patients who started antibiotic treatment upon admission when representative cultures as well as urinary antigen tests show no signs of involvement of bacterial pathogens after 48 hours. For patients with secondary bacterial respiratory infection we recommend to follow other guideline recommendations on antibacterial treatment for patients with hospital-acquired and ventilator-associated pneumonia. An antibiotic treatment duration of five days in patients with COVID-19 and suspected bacterial respiratory infection is recommended upon improvement of signs, symptoms and inflammatory markers.

However, variability in specimen quality can alter the Ct values obtained from SARS-CoV-2 clinical assays. We sought to define how variable nasopharyngeal (NP) swab quality impacts clinical SARS-CoV-2 test sensitivity. METHODS: We performed amplification of a human gene target (β-actin) in parallel with a clinical RT-PCR targeting the SARS-CoV-2 ORF1ab gene for 1311 NP specimens collected from patients with clinical concern for COVID-19. We evaluated the relationship between NP specimen quality, characterized by high Ct values for the human gene target β-actin Ct, and the probability of SARS-CoV-2 detection via logistic regression, as well as the linear relationship between SARS-CoV-2 and β-actin Ct. RESULTS: Low quality NP swabs are less likely to detect SARS-CoV-2 (odds ratio 0.654, 95%CI 0.523 to 0.802). We observed a positive linear relationship between SARS-CoV-2 and β-actin Ct values (slope 0.169, 95%CI 0.092 to 0.247). COVID-19 disease severity was not associated with β-actin Ct values. CONCLUSIONS: Variability in NP specimen quality accounts for significant differences in the sensitivity of clinical SARS-CoV-2 assays. If unrecognized, low quality NP specimens, which are characterized by a low level of amplifiable human DNA target, may limit the application of SARS-CoV-2 Ct values to direct infection control and public health interventions.","Richard-Greenblatt, Melissa; Ziegler, Matthew J.; Bromberg, Valerie; Huang, Elizabeth; Abdallah, Hatem; Tolomeo, Pam; Lautenbach, Ebbing; Glaser, Laurel; Kelly, Brendan J.",medRxiv,10,5

Telehealth quickly became essential during the COVID-19 pandemic as a result of stay-at-home orders. Regulatory waivers encouraged the use of telehealth as an alternative to the in-person encounter to limit the spread of disease. The pandemic incited a rapid growth in telehealth, and new legislation, new technologies, and providers new to virtual care changed the delivery of traditional telehealth. Postpandemic planning is necessary to support the safe integration of telehealth in the health care system. The purpose of this article is to discuss the current issues affecting telehealth and offer recommendations for safer virtual care. Critical considerations, beginning with an assessment of remote patient acuity, are needed to ensure the standard of care for telehealth is equivalent to the in-person setting. A triage protocol to screen patients seeking virtual services is required to prevent underestimation of severity of illness, sort patients to place of service, and determine if a need exists to escalate to an in-person evaluation or higher level of care. A standard approach to triage may minimize the risks to patient safety and support the appropriate use of telehealth technologies.","Kobeissi, Mahrokh M; Ruppert, Susan D",Journal of the American Association of Nurse Practitioners,10,24

In addition to the abundance of evidence supporting the ergogenic benefits of creatine supplementation, recent evidence suggests a far broader application for creatine within various myopathies, neurodegenerative diseases, and other pathologies. Furthermore, creatine has been found to exhibit non-energy related properties, contributing as a possible direct and in-direct antioxidant and eliciting anti-inflammatory effects. In spite of the new clinical success of supplemental creatine, there is little scientific insight into the potential effects of creatine on cardiovascular disease (CVD), the leading cause of mortality. Taking into consideration the non-energy related actions of creatine, highlighted in this review, it can be speculated that creatine supplementation may serve as an adjuvant therapy for the management of vascular health in at-risk populations. This review, therefore, not only aims to summarize the current literature surrounding creatine and vascular health, but to also shed light onto the potential mechanisms in which creatine may be able to serve as a beneficial supplement capable of imparting vascular-protective properties and promoting vascular health.","Clarke, Holly; Hickner, Robert C.; Ormsbee, Michael J.",Nutrients,10,25

However, widespread gaps in the quality of primary health care still exist. In this Review, we aim to identify the causes for this poor quality, and provide policy recommendations. System challenges include: the suboptimal education and training of primary health-care practitioners, a fee-for-service payment system that incentivises testing and treatments over prevention, fragmentation of clinical care and public health service, and insufficient continuity of care throughout the entire health-care system. The following recommendations merit consideration: (1) enhancement of the quality of training for primary health-care physicians, (2) establishment of performance accountability to incentivise high-quality and high-value care; (3) integration of clinical care with the basic public health services, and (4) strengthening of the coordination between primary health-care institutions and hospitals. Additionally, China should consider modernising its primary health-care system through the establishment of a learning health system built on digital data and innovative technologies.","Li, Xi; Krumholz, Harlan M; Yip, Winnie; Cheng, Kar Keung; De Maeseneer, Jan; Meng, Qingyue; Mossialos, Elias; Li, Chuang; Lu, Jiapeng; Su, Meng; Zhang, Qiuli; Xu, Dong Roman; Li, Liming; Normand, Sharon-Lise T; Peto, Richard; Li, Jing; Wang, Zengwu; Yan, Hongbing; Gao, Runlin; Chunharas, Somsak; Gao, Xin; Guerra, Raniero; Ji, Huijie; Ke, Yang; Pan, Zhigang; Wu, Xianping; Xiao, Shuiyuan; Xie, Xinying; Zhang, Yujuan; Zhu, Jun; Zhu, Shanzhu; Hu, Shengshou",Lancet,10,11

We herein report that severe acutely infected patients have high levels of both type-1 and type-2 cytokines. Our results show abnormal cytokine levels upon T cell stimulation, in a non-polarized profile. Furthermore, our findings indicate that this hyperactive cytokine response is associated with a significantly increased frequency of late-differentiated T cells with particular phenotype of effector exhausted/senescent CD28 (-)CD57 (+) cells. Interestingly, we demonstrated for the first time an increased frequency of CD3 (+)CD4 (+)CD28 (-)CD57 (+) T cells with expression of programmed death 1 (PD-1), one of the hallmarks of T cell exhaustion. These findings reveal that COVID-19 is associated with acute immunodeficiency, especially within the CD4 (+) T cell compartment and points to possible mechanisms of loss of clonal repertoire and susceptibility to viral relapse and reinfection events.","Arcanjo, Angélica; Pinto, Kamila Guimarães; Logullo, Jorgete; Leite, Paulo Emílio Corrêa; Menezes, Camilla Cristie Barreto; Freire-de-Lima, Leonardo; Diniz-Lima, Israel; Decoté-Ricardo, Debora; Rodrigues-da-Silva, Rodrigo Nunes; Freire-de-Lima, Celio Geraldo; Filardy, Alessandra Almeida; Lima-Junior, Josué da Costa; Bertho, Alvaro Luiz; De Luca, Paula Mello; Granjeiro, José Mauro; Barroso, Shana Priscila Coutinho; Conceição-Silva, Fátima; Savino, Wilson; Morrot, Alexandre",J Infect Dis,10,16

The virus has quickly spread to a large number of countries leading to a great number of deaths. Unfortunately, till today there is no specific treatment or vaccination for SARS-CoV-2. Most of the suggested treatment medications are based on in vitro laboratory investigations, experimental animal models, or previous clinical experience in treating similar viruses such as SARS-CoV-1 or other retroviral infections. The running of any clinical trial during a pandemic is affected at multiple levels. Reasons for this include patient hesitancy or inability to continue investigative treatments due to self-isolation/quarantine, or limited access to public places (including hospitals). Additional barriers relate to health care professionals being committed to other critical tasks or quarantining themselves due to contact with COVID-19 positive patients. The best research approaches are those that adapt to such external unplanned obstacles. Ongoing clinical trials before COVID-19 pandemic have the potential for identifying important therapies in the long-term if they can be completed as planned. However, these clinical trials may require modifications due a pandemic such as this one to ensure the rights, safety, and wellbeing of participants as well as medical staff involved in the conduction of clinical trials. Clinical trials initiated during the pandemic must be time-efficient and flexible due to high contagiousness of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, the significant number of reported deaths, and time constraints needed to perform high quality clinical trials, enrolling adequate sample sizes. Collaboration between different countries as well as implementation of innovative clinical trial designs are essential to successfully complete such initiatives during the current pandemic. Studies looking at the long term sequalae of COVID-19 are also of importance as recent publications describe multi-organ involvement.

The virus exists in many different genetic forms which made the disease control very difficult. The present study describes the development and validation of TaqMan probe‐based real‐time reverse transcription‐polymerase chain reaction (real‐time RT‐PCR) targeting the S1 coding region of S gene characteristic for the GII‐1 lineage (formerly the D1466‐like variant) of IBV. These strains are quite different from other European IBV belonging to different lineages of the GI genotype. The developed method was 30‐fold more sensitive than used so far for standard nested RT‐PCR with detection limit of 56 RNA copies per reaction. The specificity of the assay was also evaluated with a panel of different poultry pathogens. Repeatability and reproducibility of the method was very high with coefficients of variation lower than 4%. One hundred and twenty‐seven IBV‐positive samples were tested by this method and GII‐1 strains were detected in four of them (3·15%) which indicate a decrease in the GII‐1 IBV prevalence in Poland. The assay was proven to be a valuable tool for rapid diagnosis of GII‐1 lineage of IBV strains and moreover it enabled the monitoring of viral loads which can be used to assess disease progression.

The assay revealed to be more sensitive than standard nested RT‐PCR assay, previously used for this purpose. The developed assay has been tested on numerous field samples and revealed 3·15% prevalence of this lineage of IBV in Polish chicken population. Moreover, this new assay enables the assessment of viral load measurement which might be useful for epidemiology and pathogenesis studies.","Domanska‐Blicharz, K.; Lisowska, A.; Pikuła, A.; Sajewicz‐Krukowska, J.",Lett Appl Microbiol,10,23

This analysis cannot be done for all samples due to the conventional process using the extraction and HPLC methods requires a long analysis time and sample destruction. Therefore, near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) was employed to classify the class of A. paniculata and to determine the content of two active ingredients, andrographolide (AP1) and dehydroandrographolide (AP3) in A. paniculata, rapidly and non-destructively. One hundred twenty dried powder samples were obtained from aerial parts, branches, leaves, and branches mixed with leaves. The NIR absorption scans were collected from a broad spectral region (1000–2500 nm). Then, the scanned samples were extracted and analyzed for their AP1 and AP3 contents using an HPLC reference method. The success classification model based on AP1 level was developed using the second derivative pretreated NIR spectra of the entire wavelength region using the Partial Least Squares-Discriminant Analysis (PLS-DA) method. The NIR calibration models were developed and tested for quantitative analysis with 50 independent samples. The models were identified for the analysis of the AP1 content with excellent performance (correlation coefficient (R) = 0.98; standard error of validation (SEV) = 0.24%) and for the analysis of the AP3 content at a good level of efficiency (R = 0.93; SEV = 0.15%). This study showed that NIR spectroscopic method offers rapid analysis for the selection of A. paniculata that meets the requirement in bioactive amount.

The increasing number of SARS-CoV-2 infections raises the need for better antibody detection assays. Current antibody detection methods compromise sensitivity for speed or are sensitive but time-consuming. A large proportion of SARS-CoV-2-neutralizing antibodies target the receptor-binding domain (RBD), one of the primary immunogenic compartments of SARS-CoV-2. We have recently designed and developed a highly sensitive, bioluminescent-tagged RBD (NanoLuc HiBiT-RBD) to detect SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. The following text describes the procedure to produce the HiBiT-RBD complex and a fast assay to evaluate the presence of RBD-targeting antibodies using this tool. Due to the durability of the HiBiT-RBD protein product over a wide range of temperatures and the shorter experimental procedure that can be completed within 1 h, the protocol can be considered as a more efficient alternative to detect SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in patient serum samples.","Rezaei, Reza; Surendran, Abera; Singaravelu, Ragunath; Jamieson, Taylor R; Taklifi, Parisa; Poutou, Joanna; Azad, Taha; Ilkow, Carolina S",Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE,10,10

Here, we present The Genome Detective Coronavirus Typing Tool that can accurately identify the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) related coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) sequences isolated in China and around the world. The tool can accept up to 2,000 sequences per submission and the analysis of a new whole genome sequence will take approximately one minute. The tool has been tested and validated with hundreds of whole genomes from ten coronavirus species, and correctly classified all of the SARS-related coronavirus (SARSr-CoV) and all of the available public data for SARS-CoV-2. The tool also allows tracking of new viral mutations as the outbreak expands globally, which may help to accelerate the development of novel diagnostics, drugs and vaccines to stop the COVID-19 disease.

We discuss scenarios in which ring vaccination of direct contacts of infected persons is sufficient to contain an epidemic. Ring vaccination can be successful if infectious cases are rapidly diagnosed. However, because of the inherent stochastic nature of epidemic outbreaks, both the size and duration of contained outbreaks are highly variable. Intervention requirements depend on the basic reproduction number R(0), for which different estimates exist. When faced with the decision of whether to rely on ring vaccination, the public health community should be aware that an epidemic might take time to subside even for an eventually successful intervention strategy.","Kretzschmar, Mirjam; van den Hof, Susan; Wallinga, Jacco; van Wijngaarden, Jan",Emerg Infect Dis,10,26

The disease has a high mortality rate of approximately 30–50%. Despite the high mortality rate, a dearth of effective pharmacotherapy exists that demands extensive research in this area. The complex ARDS pathophysiology which remains to be understood completely and the multifactorial etiology of the disease has led to the poor diagnosis, impeded drug-delivery to the deeper pulmonary tissues, and delayed treatment of the ARDS patients. Besides, critically ill patients are unable to tolerate the off-target side effects. The vast domain of nanobiotechnology presents several drug delivery systems offering numerous benefits such as targeted delivery, prolonged drug release, and uniform drug-distribution. The present review presents a brief insight into the ARDS pathophysiology and summarizes conventional pharmacotherapies available to date. Furthermore, the review provides an updated report of major developments in the nanomedicinal approaches for the treatment of ARDS.

By June of 2020, many people reported experiencing mild COVID-19 associated symptoms, yet did not get tested due to inaccessible testing and insufficient knowledge of the disease. There were media stories quoting grave diggers in Kano who reported high burial rates during this time. Methods: In order to draw more data on COVID-19 cases during this time period, we conducted a cross-sectional symptom survey in Kano, surveying 291 adults. Participants were asked to report demographic characteristics, past COVID-19 testing and symptoms, and community deaths. To assess associations between COVID-19 associated symptoms and socio-demographic characteristics, bivariate analyses using Chi-square tests were performed. A logistic regression assessing the association between any reported symptoms and the kind of work (indoor/outdoor) was done while adjusting for age, gender and education level. Results: Half of the respondents reported at least one symptom associated with COVID-19; the three most common symptoms were loss of appetite, cough, and fever. There was a statistically significant relationship between age group of the respondent and presence of COVID-19 associated symptoms. Gender or level of education did not have statistically significant association with COVID-19 associated symptoms among the respondents. People with outdoor occupations such as trading and hawking were more than twice as likely to report COVID-19 associated symptoms compared to those who were unemployed. Just under half of the respondents reported knowing someone who died in their community, with unexplained causes attributed to two-thirds of these cases. Our study found evidence of COVID-19 associated symptoms especially among the older population and unexplained deaths in Kano. Lack of confirmatory laboratory tests and absence of baseline vital statistics precluded us from finding definitive evidence for or against COVID-19 infection and associated mortality.","Shahani, D.; Farouq, Z.

During spread from infected cells, vaccinia virus (VACV) particles induce localized actin nucleation that propel virus to surrounding cells and facilitate cell‐to‐cell spread of infection. Here we show that virus‐tipped actin comets are composed of β‐ and γ‐actin. We employed isoform‐specific siRNA knockdown to examine the role of the two isoforms in VACV‐induced actin comets. Despite the high level of similarity between the actin isoforms, and their colocalization, VACV‐induced actin nucleation was dependent exclusively on β‐actin. Knockdown of β‐actin led to a reduction in the release of virus from infected cells, a phenotype dependent on virus‐induced Arp2/3 complex activity. We suggest that local concentrations of actin isoforms may regulate the activity of cellular actin nucleator complexes.","Marzook, N.

Radiologic abnormalities in sinuses occur, however, in most patients with upper respiratory virus infections. Objective: Assessment of the occurrence, clinical profile, laboratory findings, and outcome of radiologically confirmed sinusitis was carried out as part of a common cold study in young adults. Methods: Clinical examinations and radiography of the paranasal sinuses were carried out on days 1, 7, and 21 in 197 patients with the common cold. The symptoms were recorded on diary cards on days 1 to 20. Ten viruses and 5 bacteria were studied as etiologic agents of common cold as reported earlier. Serum C reactive protein concentrations, erythrocyte sedimentation rates, and total white blood cell counts with differentials were determined in 40 randomized subjects on day 7. The effect of 6 days of intranasal fluticasone propionate treatment of the common cold in the prevention of sinusitis was analyzed. Results: On day 7, 39% of patients with the common cold in the placebo group (n = 98) had sinusitis, which we would prefer to call viral sinusitis. The symptoms of patients with sinusitis and those without it were not clinically distinguishable. Viral infection was detected in 81.6% of patients with sinusitis. No significantly increased levels of antibodies to bacteria were detected. Serum C reactive protein concentrations, erythrocyte sedimentation rates, and white blood cell counts were low in patients with sinusitis. All patients made a clinical recovery within 21 days without antibiotic treatment. Fluticasone propionate treatment tended to prevent paranasal sinusitis, especially in rhinovirus-positive subjects. Conclusion: Viral sinusitis frequently occurs in the early days of the common cold, but it is a self-limited illness. The sinuses should not be imaged in patients with the common cold if the signs and symptoms of illness gradually become less severe and no specific signs suggestive of bacterial sinusitis occur.

Clausena lansium (Lour.) or wampee (WP) fruit peel is a rich source of antioxidants and flavonoids that could prove beneficial for human health. Currently, there has been no scientific evidence supporting the potency of WP peel extract to combat or reverse the memory impairment induced by chronic restraint stress (CRS). Therefore, we aimed to investigate the AChE-inhibiting and neuroprotective effects of WP peel extracts against CRS-mediated oxidative stress and cognitive dysfunction in rats. Initial assessment of the extract revealed antioxidant capacity and high concentrations of polyphenols. Further, Wistar rats were dosed orally with the WP peel extract (200, 400, and 600 mg/kg daily) and kept in a restrainer for 4 h a day for 28 consecutive days. The object recognition and Morris water maze tests were used to determine cognitive functions. After sacrifice, biomarkers of oxidative stress and AChE inhibitory activity in brain homogenates of rats were also investigated. CRS exposure produced oxidative stress and increased AChE activity, changes that led to learning and memory impairment in the cognition tests. Improved memory, reduced AChE activity, and a decreased oxidative stress status were seen in rats treated with WP peel extract. Overall, supplementation with WP peel extract may exert cognitive-enhancing effects through antioxidative neuroprotection and inhibition of AChE activity against CRS-induced oxidative stress.","Phachonpai, W.; Tongun, T.",Heliyon,10,16

Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is an angiogenic factor that also induces potent increases in vascular permeability; it is a candidate mediator of rhinorrhea in response to rhinovirus infection as well as contributing to enhanced vascular leakage in rhinovirus‐linked asthma exacerbations. It has been shown that rhinovirus induces significant increases in both VEGF protein and mRNA in primary airway fibroblasts [Ghildyal et al. (2005): J Med Virol 75:608–615]. The current studies assessed VEGF responses to rhinovirus in primary culture airway epithelium, in epithelial and fibroblast cell lines and in rhinovirus‐infected nasal secretions. Epithelial and fibroblast cells were infected with rhinovirus serotype 16 and VEGF protein and isoforms assessed by ELISA and RT‐PCR, respectively. VEGF protein was released by both epithelial and fibroblast cell lines and primary airway epithelial cells in culture but was not increased following rhinovirus infection. PCR products coding for four or five of the six known VEGF isoforms were produced (121, 145, 165 and 183, and/or 189 amino acids) in cell lines and primary culture cells, but no specific isoform was linked to rhinovirus infection. Nasal VEGF was also measured in a cohort of asthmatics with verified rhinovirus and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection. VEGF was not raised following rhinovirus infection alone, but was increased significantly if concomitant RSV infection was present. The data suggest that fibroblasts rather than the epithelium may play a key role in VEGF mediated vascular responses after rhinovirus infection. This may aid recruitment of inflammatory cells and contribute to airway inflammation and bronchial obstruction. J. Med.

Three extraction methods were tested, that is, the MagNA Pure LC™, the COBAS Ampliprep™, and the MagNA Pure 96™ with 10‐fold dilutions of an influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 sample. Two hundred thirty‐nine respiratory specimens, 35 throat swabs, 164 nasopharyngeal specimens, and 40 broncho‐alveolar fluids, were extracted with the MagNA Pure 96™ and the COBAS Ampliprep™ instruments. Forty COBAS Ampliprep™ positive samples were also tested. Real‐time PCRs were used to identify influenza A and influenza A(H1N1)pdm09, rhinovirus, enterovirus, adenovirus, varicella zoster virus, cytomegalovirus, and herpes simplex virus. Similar results were obtained on RNA extracted from dilutions of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 with the three systems: the MagNA Pure LC™, the COBAS Ampliprep™, and the MagNA Pure 96™. Data from clinical respiratory specimens extracted with the MagNA Pure 96™ and COBAS Ampliprep™ instruments were in 98.5% in agreement (P < 0.0001) for influenza A and influenza A(H1N1)pdm09. Data for rhinovirus were in 97.3% agreement (P < 0.0001) and in 96.8% agreement for enterovirus. They were in 100% agreement for adenovirus. Data for cytomegalovirus and HSV1‐2 were in 95.2% agreement (P < 0.0001). The MagNA Pure 96™ instrument is easy‐to‐use, reliable, and has a high throughput for extracting total nucleic acid from respiratory specimens.

Acute lung inflammatory edema is a major pathological finding in autopsies explaining O(2) diffusion failure and hypoxemia. Only dexamethasone has been shown to reduce mortality in severe cases, further supporting a role for inflammation in disease severity. SARS-CoV-2 enters cells employing angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as a receptor, which is highly expressed in lung alveolar cells. ACE2 is one of the components of the cellular machinery that inactivates the potent inflammatory agent bradykinin, and SARS-CoV-2 infection could interfere with the catalytic activity of ACE2, leading to the accumulation of bradykinin. Methods: In this case control study, we tested two pharmacological inhibitors of the kinin–kallikrein system that are currently approved for the treatment of hereditary angioedema, icatibant, and inhibitor of C1 esterase/kallikrein, in a group of 30 patients with severe COVID-19. Results: Neither icatibant nor inhibitor of C1 esterase/kallikrein resulted in changes in time to clinical improvement. However, both compounds were safe and promoted the significant improvement of lung computed tomography scores and increased blood eosinophils, which are indicators of disease recovery. Conclusions: In this small cohort, we found evidence for safety and a beneficial role of pharmacological inhibition of the kinin–kallikrein system in two markers that indicate improved disease recovery.","Mansour, Eli; Palma, Andre C.; Ulaf, Raisa G.; Ribeiro, Luciana C.; Bernardes, Ana Flavia; Nunes, Thyago A.; Agrela, Marcus V.; Bombassaro, Bruna; Monfort-Pires, Milena; Camargo, Rafael L.; Araujo, Eliana P.; Brunetti, Natalia S.; Farias, Alessandro S.; Falcão, Antônio Luís E.; Santos, Thiago Martins; Trabasso, Plinio; Dertkigil, Rachel P.; Dertkigil, Sergio S.; Moretti, Maria Luiza; Velloso, Licio A.",Viruses,10,29

Un circuit de prise en charge ambulatoire (REB-ambu) a été mis en place. Matériels et méthodes La mise à disposition de la RT-PCR SARS-CoV-2 dans notre centre a rendu possible l’ouverture du REB-ambu dans une zone isolée de l’HDJ avec porte d’accès dédiée et traitement d’air (Plasmair®) permettant d’accueillir jusqu’à 5 patients par jour. Les critères permettant la prise en charge ambulatoire étaient restreints : absence de comorbidité majeure, absence de signe de gravité, la possibilité d’isolement à domicile et la venue si possible par leurs propres moyens. Un examen clinique était réalisé à l’arrivée du patient pour réorientation en hospitalisation en cas de signe de gravité. Un prélèvement nasopharyngé était réalisé pour recherche du COVID-19. Les RT-PCR étaient effectuées 2 fois par jour, avec rendu des résultats en 4heures. Les patients étaient installés en salle d’attente avec port permanent de masque chirurgical jusqu’à réception des résultats. En cas de résultat négatif, la prise en charge était adaptée au cas par cas. En cas de résultat positif, un transfert en hospitalisation en secteur spécialisé était prévu. Résultats Au total, sur 85 patients classés « cas possibles » du 30/01 au 14/02/20, 60 (71 %) ont été pris en charge au REB-ambu dont 23 (38 %) de nationalité chinoise. Quarante-six (77 %) des patients sont venus par leurs propres moyens et 8 (13 %) par SMUR ou ambulance privée régulée par SAMU. Aucune réorientation en hospitalisation n’a été nécessaire. Aucun cas d’infection COVID-19 n’a été confirmé. Se sont déclarés satisfaits de la prise en charge 41 (87 %) des 47 patients interrogés. Conclusion La mise en place d’un circuit ambulatoire a permis la prise en charge rapide d’un nombre important de cas possibles d’infection COVID-19. Cette structure semble adaptée pour des infections peu sévères, pour lesquelles les critères de classement génèrent un nombre élevé de cas possibles, ayant un risque de contagiosité limité permettant l’attente des résultats en salle commune, et pour lesquelles un résultat microbiologique est disponible rapidement. Un tel circuit permet de limiter la désorganisation des secteurs d’hospitalisation conventionnelle et la mobilisation du SAMU, qui restent réservés aux cas sévères. Dans notre série, l’orientation en ambulatoire réalisée par téléphone, a été correcte. L’acceptabilité auprès des patients semble bonne malgré l’attente initiale à domicile, le délai de rendu du résultat et l’attente en salle commune. La faisabilité semble également correcte y compris pour des patients étrangers. Néanmoins, des difficultés de transport et d’orientation des patients ont été rencontrées.","Lehur, A.; Pourbaix, A.; Souhail, B.; Lescure, X.; Yazdanpanah, Y.; Deconinck, L.",Médecine et Maladies Infectieuses,10,12

Lenalidomide-refractory patients now represent a challenge with inferior progression free survival (PFS) reported to subsequent treatments. We therefore sought to describe the natural history of MM patients following lenalidomide in the real world. METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort review of patients with relapsed MM who received lenalidomide-based treatments in the U.K. Data were collected for demographics, subsequent therapies, treatment responses, survival outcomes and clinical trial enrollment. RESULTS: 198 patients received lenalidomide-based treatments at a median of 2 prior lines of therapy at a median of 41 months (range 0.5-210) from diagnosis. 114 patients (72% of 158 evaluable) became refractory to lenalidomide. The overall survival (OS) after lenalidomide failure was 14.7 months having received between 0-6 subsequent lines of therapy. Few deep responses were observed with subsequent treatments and the PFS to each further line was < 7 months. There was a steep reduction in numbers of patients able to receive further treatment, with an associated increase in number of deaths. The OS of patients progressing on lenalidomide who did not enter a clinical trial incorporating novel agents was very poor (8.8 months versus 30 months, p 0.0002), although the trials group were a biologically fitter group. CONCLUSION: These data demonstrate the poor outcomes of patients failing lenalidomide-based treatments in the real world, the highlight need for more effective treatments.","Lecat, Catherine S.

Epidemiologic techniques succeeded in containing the disease in China, but efforts were not as successful in the rest of the world, particularly the United States where there have been 1,592, 599 cases with 95,863 deaths as of May 25, 2020. Projections are for continued new infections and deaths if no effective treatments can be activated over the next six months.. We performed a systematic review to determine the potential time course of development of treatments and vaccines focusing on availability in the last half of 2020. Methods. Our search was performed during the week of May 17, 2020. Publications: We reviewed up to date information from several sources to identify potential treatments for COVID-19: We used the Reagan-Udall Expanded Access Navigator COVID-19 Treatment Hub to track the efforts of companies to develop treatments. We then used the results to search for publications on pubmed.gov and on MedRxiv, the preprint server. We further used a targeted Google search to find announcements of trial results. Clinical Trials: We searched for all investigational trials involving potential treatments using several different sources: (A) covid-trials.org, then validated results on (B) clinicaltrials.gov and the (C) World Health Organization's International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (WHO ICTRP). We focused on trials which were completed or currently recruiting for patients, reasoning that the timeline to arrive at treatments by the end of the year would require completion within the next 6 months. We excluded studies which were clearly observational, with no randomization, control or comparison group. We furtherset a cutoff of 100 for numbers of subjects since smaller trial size could lack statistical power to establish superiority of the intervention over the control condition. Results. Published Data: We found 19 publications reporting findings on 6 classes of agents. There were 9 publications related to hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), three on lopanovir/ritonavir (LPV/R) (one of which was combined with interferon beta-1),three on remdesivir, two on favipiravir, one on mepaluzamab, and one on tocilizumab. Ten publications reported randomized controlled trials, the rest were retrospective observational. Only one publication touched on outpatient management, the rest on hospitalized patients. Clinical Trials: We found 409 trials meeting our minimum requirement of 100 subjects which were recruiting or completed. The WHO has launched the Solidarity megatrial performed in over 100 countries actively comparing HCQ, lopanovir/ritonavir (LPV/R) alone and in combination with interferon beta-1, and remdesivir. That trial is scheduled to complete enrollment in the first quarter of 2021. In addition, we found 46 trials of HCQ, 11 trials of LPV/R and 8 trials of interferons. There were 18 ongoing trials of antiviral agents, 24 immune modulator trials, 9 vaccine trials, and 62 trials of other agents.We excluded a large number of trials of Chinese traditional medications, reasoning that there was insufficient clinical experience with these agents outside China to offer these treatments to the rest of the world. Forty four trials were hoping to complete enrollment by the end of the second quarter of 2020. Of these, only 9 were conducted on outpatients. A few vaccine trials are hoping to complete Phase 3 enrollment by the end of the third quarter, but a prolonged follow-up of patients will likely be required. Conclusion. Several treatments for severe disease in hospitalized patients have now been granted emergency authorization. However, the disease is propagated primarily by infected ambulatory individuals. There are only a few randomized controlled studies in outpatients which can be expected to yield results in time to impact on the continuing spread of the epidemic in 2020. It will be necessary for public health authorities to make hard decisions with limited data. The choices will be hardest in dealing with potential early release of vaccines.

Using data from a cross-sectional sample of students aged 12–14 from 20 elementary schools (n = 1802) and consenting parents (n = 843), we applied a nominal logistic regression model to highlight important predictors of AST. The findings showed that street network connectivity (as measured by two novel space syntax measures, metric reach and directional reach) was the main deciding factor for active commuting to school, while parents’ perceptions of condition of sidewalks and shade-casting street trees were moderately significant factors associated with AST. Overall, this study demonstrated the significance of spatial structure of street network around the homes in the potential for encouraging AST, and more importantly, the need to consider objective and perceived environmental attributes when strategizing means to increase this mode choice and reduce ill-health among children.","Ozbil, Ayse; Yesiltepe, Demet; Argin, Gorsev; Rybarczyk, Greg",Int J Environ Res Public Health,10,12

Viruses still remain one of the main causes of human diseases, mainly because the development of new vaccines is usually challenging and drug resistance has become an increasing concern in recent decades. Therefore, the development of potential antiviral agents remains crucial and is an unmet clinical need. One abundant source of potential therapeutic molecules are plants: they biosynthesize a myriad of compounds, including peptides which can have antimicrobial activity. Our objective is to summarize the literature on peptides with antiviral properties derived from plants and to identify key features of these peptides and their application in systemic viral infections. This literature review highlights studies including clinical trials which demonstrated that plant cyclotides have the ability to inhibit the growth of viruses causing human diseases, defensin-like peptides possess anti-HIV-1 activity, and lipid transfer proteins and some lectins exhibit a varied antimicrobial profile.

However, in a small minority, patients can experience severe asthma with respiratory failure and hypercapnia, necessitating intensive care unit admission. Hypercapnia occurs due to alveolar hypoventilation and insufficient removal of carbon dioxide (CO(2)) from the blood. Although mild hypercapnia is generally well tolerated in patients with asthma, there is accumulating evidence that elevated levels of CO(2) can act as a gaso-signaling molecule, triggering deleterious effects in various organs such as the lung, skeletal muscles and the innate immune system. Here, we review recent advances on pathophysiological response to hypercapnia and discuss potential detrimental effects of hypercapnia in patients with asthma.","Shigemura, Masahiko; Homma, Tetsuya; Sznajder, Jacob I",J Clin Med,10,1

While wastewater surveillance has been applied at various scales to monitor population-level COVID-19 dynamics, there is a need for quantitative metrics to interpret wastewater data in the context of public health trends. We collected 24-hour composite wastewater samples from March 2020 through May 2021 from a Massachusetts wastewater treatment plant and measured SARS-CoV-2 RNA concentrations using RT-qPCR. We show that the relationship between wastewater viral titers and COVID-19 clinical cases and deaths varies over time. We demonstrate the utility of three new metrics to monitor changes in COVID-19 epidemiology: (1) the ratio between wastewater viral titers and clinical cases (WC ratio), (2) the time lag between wastewater and clinical reporting, and (3) a transfer function between the wastewater and clinical case curves. We find that the WC ratio increases after key events, providing insight into the balance between disease spread and public health response. We also find that wastewater data preceded clinically reported cases in the first wave of the pandemic but did not serve as a leading indicator in the second wave, likely due to increased testing capacity. These three metrics could complement a framework for integrating wastewater surveillance into the public health response to the COVID-19 pandemic and future pandemics.","Xiao, Amy; Wu, Fuqing; Bushman, Mary; Zhang, Jianbo; Imakaev, Maxim; Chai, Peter R; Duvallet, Claire; Endo, Noriko; Erickson, Timothy B; Armas, Federica; Arnold, Brian; Chen, Hongjie; Chandra, Franciscus; Ghaeli, Newsha; Gu, Xiaoqiong; Hanage, William P; Lee, Wei Lin; Matus, Mariana; McElroy, Kyle A; Moniz, Katya; Rhode, Steven F; Thompson, Janelle; Alm, Eric J",medRxiv,10,26

Qualitative studies examining how well prepared and supported HCWs feel are lacking despite their key role. This study investigated how prepared and supported front-line HCWs at an Australian tertiary hospital felt about managing HCIDs such as viral haemorrhagic fever (VHF). METHODS: A qualitative research approach was used to undertake interviews with 45 Royal Melbourne Hospital medical and nursing staff from emergency, intensive care and infectious diseases. Interview questions captured data on HCWs’ role, familiarity with using protocols, psychological attributes and training for scenarios related to VHF patient management. Interviews were recorded and transcribed. Categorical responses were analysed quantitatively and open-ended responses were analysed thematically. RESULTS: Ninety-eight percent of participants indicated feeling capable of undertaking their role in managing VHF patients; 77% felt supported through personnel/resources. However, 69% indicated barriers to managing these patients effectively; and 68% felt anxious at the prospect of managing VHF patients. Themes emerging from participants’ observations included concerns about training frequency, miscommunication, difficulty with uncertainty, feeling underprepared, and fear of transmitting infection to others. CONCLUSION: Although the majority of HCWs feel confident about their ability to care for VHF patients, they also have a moderately-high degree of anxiety. Perceptions of interviewed staff have fed into recommendations to increase HCW preparedness and reduce anxiety, which include investigating support services, and exploring training options that create multi-departmental groups of highly specialised medical officers and nurses.","Fryk, Jesse J.; Tong, Steven; Marshall, Caroline; Rajkhowa, Arjun; Buising, Kirsty; MacIsaac, Christopher; Walsham, Nicola; Thevarajan, Irani",Infect Dis Health,10,1

The objectives of this study were to add context to the global data and international genomic consortiums, and to give insight into the efficiency of the contact tracing system in Oman. METHODS: We combined epidemiological data and whole-genome sequence data from 94 samples of SARS-CoV-2 in Oman to understand the origins, genetic variation, and transmissibility. The whole-genome size of sequence data was obtained through a customized SARS-COV-2 research panel. Amplifier methods ranged from 26 Kbp to 30 Kbp and were submitted to GISAID. FINDINGS: The study found that P323L (94.7%) is the most common mutation, followed by D614G (92.6%) Spike protein mutation. A unique mutation, I280V, was first reported in Oman and was associated with a rare lineage, B.1.113 (10.6%). In addition, the study revealed a good agreement between genetic and epidemiological data. INTERPRETATION: Oman’s robust surveillance system was very efficient in guiding the outbreak investigation processes in the country, the study illustrates the future importance of molecular epidemiology in leading the national response to outbreaks and pandemics.","Al-Mahruqi, Samira; Al-Wahaibi, Adil; Khan, Abdul Latif; Al-Jardani, Amina; Asaf, Sajjad; Alkindi, Hanan; Al-Kharusi, Samiha; Al-Rawahi, Ahmed N.; Al-Rawahi, Ahmed; Al-Salmani, Majid; Al-Shukri, Intisar; Al-Busaidi, Aisha; Al-Abri, Seif Salem; Al-Harrasi, Ahmed",Int J Infect Dis,10,33
