Effective treatment, however, was not possible at that time; prevention and spread of infectious diseases depended solely on proper hygienic means. At the beginning of the 20th century, passive and active vaccination procedures were developed against a number of these PATHOGENIC MICRO-ORGANISMS to prevent the diseases in question (rabies, diphtheria, tetanus, etc.). Thanks to the discovery of antimicrobial chemicals (by Paul Ehrlich) and antibiotics (by Sir Alexander Fleming), the threat of infectious diseases seemed to be minimised. Large scale vaccination programmes against childhood diseases (diphtheria, whooping cough and polio), started in the early 1950s, raised hopes of finally being able to eradicate these diseases from the planet.","Verhoef, Jan; van Kessel, Kok; Snippe, Harm",Principles of Immunopharmacology,770,20

It has a devastating impact on the supply chain management and its sustainability. Many firms were forced to close due to unavailability of raw materials, essential ingredients, and labor shortage. Not many firms were capable of efficiently handling such disruptive situation. There is not much study on appropriate supply chain strategy for such turbulent situation. The practitioners as well as academic researchers are interested to know how to deal with such situation and remain sustainable for any such future crisis like COVID-19. In this background the aim of this study is to examine the determinants that impact the supply chain sustainability during turbulent situation. The study investigates how firm capability and government regulation impact the supply chain sustainability during turbulent environment. With the help of literature review, dynamic capability theory and contingency theory, a theoretical model has been developed. Later the model has been validated using PLS-SEM technique with 315 usable responses from employees of different firms in India engaged in supply chain management process. The study finds out that firms’ capabilities, leadership team support and contingency plan play vital role to formulate appropriate supply chain strategy which in turn positively impacts supply chain sustainability during turbulent environment. The study also finds that there is a moderating role of government regulation impacting supply chain management during the turbulent environment.","Chatterjee, Sheshadri; Chaudhuri, Ranjan",Oper Manag Res,770,28

To better understand how they evolve, we introduce the notion of EE path dependence based on an original combination of an evolutionary approach and complex adaptive system theory. We thus present a whirlwind model that takes the form of subecosystems and that integrates a structural approach with attributes and a dynamic approach with sequences. Context is addressed through narratives and entrepreneurial stories. We conducted a case study on the EE of Montpellier, France. To characterize the subecosystems, we quantified the attributes using NVivo software, showing their links and evolution over time. The results shed light on the subecosystems that contributed the most to the entrepreneurial dynamics. This study contributes to extending path dependence theory to EEs. The results may help policymakers rethink their development strategies by setting priorities in accordance with the drivers of their EEs.

Using data from a representative sample of the Portuguese population (N = 1,411) collected early in the pandemic, we find that while media sources were more frequently used, scientific sources played a more important role on perceived personal and societal-level risks; higher trust in scientific sources associated with increased risk perceptions (i.e., amplified perceived risk), trust in social media associated with dismissing personal threat (i.e., attenuated perceived risk). These findings suggest that people's relations with science were determinant factors in risk perceptions, and dimensions that measure these deserve further investigation.","Entradas, Marta",Health communication,770,1

STUDY DESIGN We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials and observational studies in the English language assessing effects of proton pump inhibitors and histamine-2 receptor antagonists on PICU patients published before October 2018 from PubMed, EMBASE, CINAHL, and CENTRAL databases. Random-effect Mantel-Haenszel risk difference (MHRD) model was used to pool all the selected studies for meta-analysis. Primary outcomes were incidence of gastrointestinal bleeding and nosocomial pneumonia. Secondary outcomes included mortality and length of PICU stay. RESULTS Seventeen studies (4 randomized controlled trials and 13 observational) comprising 340,763 patients were included. Overall incidence of gastrointestinal bleeding was 15.2%. There was no difference in the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding (MHRD 5.0%; 95%CI -1.0% to 11.0%, I2=62%) between SUP status. There was increased risk of nosocomial pneumonia for patients who received SUP (MHRD 5.3%; 95%CI 3.5% to 7.0%; I2=0%) compared with those who did not. An increased risk of mortality was found in patients receiving SUP (MHRD 2.1%; 95%CI 2.0% to 2.2%; I2=0%), although when one large study was removed in a sensitivity analysis this association was no longer found. No statistical difference was found in length of PICU stay between the groups (standardized mean difference 0.42; 95%CI -0.16 to 1.01 days; I2=89.8%). CONCLUSIONS SUP does not show clear benefit in reducing gastrointestinal bleeding or PICU stay. Observational studies suggest an increased risk of nosocomial pneumonia and mortality with SUP, which needs to be validated in clinical trials.","Jie Yao, Dominic Wen; Ong, Chengsi; Eales, Nichola Mary; Sultana, Rehena; Ju-Ming Wong, Judith; Lee, Jan Hau",The Journal of pediatrics,770,1

The objective of this study was to investigate whether perineal burns affect in-hospital mortality. Using data from the nation-wide burn registry collected from April 1, 2011 to March 31, 2019, we retrospectively identified 10,179 hospitalized burn patients over 16 years of age. The in-hospital mortality rate between the patients with perineal burn and those with other burns was compared, and the adjusted odds ratio for in-hospital mortality was determined with multivariable logistic regression analysis controlling for age, gender, mechanism of burn injury, year of admission, total burn surface area, inhalation injury, hand injury, and transfers from another hospital. One thousand one hundred forty-nine patients with perineal burn were enrolled, and the in-hospital mortality of this group was higher than that of the group of patients with other types of burns (46 vs 5.2%, P < 0.001). Multivariable analysis found that the presence of perineal burns is associated with in-hospital mortality (odds ratio 2.11 [95% confidence intervals (CI) 1.64-2.71]; P < 0.001).

The national Kidney Allocation System prioritizes patients with Estimated Post-Transplant Survival (EPTS) scores in the top 20% for expedited access to optimal deceased donor kidneys. METHODS We studied adults aged ≥18 years in the United States Renal Data System with top 20% EPTS scores who had been preemptively waitlisted or initiated dialysis in 2015-2017. We evaluated time to waitlist placement, transplantation, and mortality with unadjusted and multivariable survival models. RESULTS Of 42,445 patients with top 20% EPTS scores (mean age, 38.0 years; 57% male; 59% White patients, and 31% Black patients), 7922 were preemptively waitlisted. Among 34,523 patients initiating dialysis, the 3-year cumulative waitlist placement incidence was 37%. Numerous factors independently associated with waitlisting included race, income, and having noncommercial insurance. For example, waitlisting was less likely for Black versus White patients, and for patients in the lowest-income neighborhoods versus those in the highest-income neighborhoods. Among patients initiating dialysis, 61% lost their top 20% EPTS status within 30 months versus 18% of patients who were preemptively listed. The 3-year incidence of deceased and living donor transplantation was 5% and 6%, respectively, for patients who initiated dialysis and 26% and 44%, respectively, for patients who were preemptively listed. CONCLUSIONS Many patients with ESKDqualifying with top 20% EPTS status are not placed on the transplant waiting list in a timely manner, with significant variation on the basis of demographic and social factors. Patients who are preemptively listed are more likely to receive benefits of top 20% EPTS status. Efforts to expedite care for qualifying candidates are needed, and automated transplant referral for patients with the best prognoses should be considered.","Schold, Jesse D; Huml, Anne M; Poggio, Emilio D; Sedor, John R; Husain, Syed A; King, Kristin L; Mohan, Sumit",Journal of the American Society of Nephrology : JASN,770,1

The relevance of the cingulate to the structure and dynamics of large-scale networks ultimately requires a link to functional connectivity. Here, we map fine-grained functional connectivity across the complete extent of the macaque (Macaca fascicularis) cingulate cortex and delineate subdivisions pertaining to distinct identifiable networks. In particular, we identified 4 primary networks representing the functional spectrum of the cingulate: somatomotor, attention-orienting, executive, and limbic. The cingulate nodes of these networks originated from separable subfields along the rostral-to-caudal axis and were characterized by positive and negative correlations of spontaneous blood oxygen level-dependent activity. These findings represent a critical component for understanding how the anterior and midcingulate cortices integrate and shape information processing during task performance. The connectivity patterns also suggest future electrophysiological targets that may reveal new functional representations including those involved in conflict monitoring.","Hutchison, R Matthew; Womelsdorf, Thilo; Gati, Joseph S; Leung, L Stan; Menon, Ravi S; Everling, Stefan",Cerebral cortex,770,0

Their clinical course can be severe with progression to lower respiratory tract infection, co-infection with serious pulmonary co-pathogens, and high mortality. Non-myeloablative conditioning regimens achieve engraftment without eradication of host hematopoietic cells, which potentially allows for protection against infections commonly seen in hematopoietic cell transplantation patients treated with standard intensity conditioning regimens. DESIGN AND METHODS We performed a retrospective cohort study to measure the incidence and severity of parainfluenza types 1-4, influenza (A and B), respiratory syncitial virus and human rhinovirus disease in myeloablative versus non-myeloablative versus autologous hematopoietic cell transplantation patients. RESULTS The incidences of all respiratory virus infections were similar in the non-myeloablative and myeloablative cohorts but less in the autologous cohort (33/420 [7.9%], 150/1593 [9.4%], and 37/751 [4.9%], respectively, p<0.0001). However, respiratory virus lower tract infections were significantly less common during the first 100 days after transplantation in non-myeloablative patients compared to myeloablative and autologous patients (1/420 [0.2%], 34/1593 [2.1%] and 16/751 [2.1%], respectively, p=0.005. Respiratory virus lower tract infection had high co-infection and attributable mortality rates. CONCLUSIONS Respiratory virus lower tract infection during the first 100 days after hematopoietic cell transplantation was less common in persons receiving non-myeloablative conditioning regimens compared to myeloablative conditioning, despite a similar overall rate of acquisition.","Schiffer, Joshua T; Kirby, Kate; Sandmaier, Brenda; Storb, Rainer; Corey, Lawrence; Boeckh, Michael",Haematologica,770,16

METHODS A multi-ethnic, multinational Latin American SLE cohort was studied. Familial lupus was defined as patients with a first-degree SLE relative; these relatives were interviewed in person or by telephone. Clinical variables, disease activity, damage, and mortality were compared. Odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were estimated. Hazard ratios (HR) were calculated using Cox proportional hazard adjusted for potential confounders for time to damage and mortality. RESULTS A total of 66 (5.6%) patients had familial lupus, and 1110 (94.4%) had sporadic lupus. Both groups were predominantly female, of comparable age, and of similar ethnic distribution. Discoid lupus (OR = 1.97; 95% CI 1.08-3.60) and neurologic disorder (OR = 1.65; 95% CI 1.00-2.73) were significantly associated with familial SLE; pericarditis was negatively associated (OR = 0.35; 95% CI 0.14-0.87). The SLE Disease Activity Index and Systemic Lupus International Collaborating Clinics/American College of Rheumatology Damage Index (SDI) were similar in both groups, although the neuropsychiatric (45.4% vs. 33.5%; p = 0.04) and musculoskeletal (6.1% vs. 1.9%; p = 0.02) domains of the SDI were more frequent in familial lupus. They were not retained in the Cox models (by domains). Familial lupus was not significantly associated with damage accrual (HR = 0.69; 95% CI 0.30-1.55) or mortality (HR = 1.23; 95% CI 0.26-4.81). CONCLUSION Familial SLE is not characterized by a more severe form of disease than sporadic lupus. We also observed that familial SLE has a higher frequency of discoid lupus and neurologic manifestations and a lower frequency of pericarditis.","Quintana, Rosana; Pons-Estel, Guillermo J; Roberts, Karen; Sacnún, Mónica; Serrano, Rosa; Nieto, Romina; Conti, Silvana; Gervasoni, Viviana; Catoggio, Luis J; Soriano, Enrique R; Scolnik, Marina; García, Mercedes A; Alvarellos, Alejandro; Saurit, Verónica; Berbotto, Guillermo A; Sato, Emilia I; Costallat, Lilian T Lavras; Neto, Eduardo Ferreira Borba; Bonfa, Eloisa; Xavier, Ricardo M; de Oliveira E Silva Montandon, Ana Carolina; Molina-Restrepo, José Fernando; Iglesias-Gamarra, Antonio; Guibert-Toledano, Marlene; Reyes-Llerena, Gil Alberto; Massardo, Loreto; Neira, Oscar J; Cardiel, Mario H; Barile-Fabris, Leonor A; Amigo, Mary-Carmen; Silveira, Luis H; Torre, Ignacio García De La; Acevedo-Vásquez, Eduardo M; Ugarte-Gil, Manuel F; Alfaro-Lozano, José Luis; Segami, María Inés; Chacón-Díaz, Rosa; Esteva-Spinetti, María H; Gomez-Puerta, José A; Alarcón, Graciela S; Pons-Estel, Bernardo A",Lupus,770,20

However, 3 days later after the second operation, he had the second intrathoracic bleeding. Emergent CP was performed with cardiopulmonary bypass by anterior transpericarsial approach via a median sternotomy.

A statistical association was found with informal employment, cigarette consumption, alcohol and psychoactive substances, risk of depression, having a disability, dissatisfaction with their quality of life, with their health, with their economic situation, as well as feeling unhappy, bad treatment and bad relationships among family members, poor social support, sexual and economic abuse, and finally, discrimination. CONCLUSIONS Suicidal ideation in older adults in three cities of Colombia is explained by the sexual and economic abuse that this population is suffering, as well as bad personal relationships between the members of the family of the older adult. The risk of depression increases the probability of having thoughts against one's life.","Ramírez Arango, Yuri Catherine; Flórez Jaramillo, Hanllely Mallely; Cardona Arango, Doris; Segura Cardona, Ángela María; Segura Cardona, Alejandra; Muñoz Rodríguez, Diana Isabel; Lizcano Cardona, Douglas; Morales Mesa, Santiago Alberto; Arango Álzate, Catalina; Agudelo Cifuentes, Maite Catalina",Revista colombiana de psiquiatria,770,16

METHODS This was a prospective study of patients who underwent LSG at Jordan University Hospital from February 2009 to January 2014. RESULTS One hundred ninety patients (mean age 34.0 ± 10.8 years; mean preoperative body mass index 46.2 ± 7.7 kg/m(2)) were included in the study. Of these, 146 were followed for 1 year and 73 were followed for 2 years. Thirty patients (20.5 %) had hypertension, 23 (15.8 %) had diabetes, 78 (53.4 %) had hyperlipidemia, 30 (20.5 %) had obstructive sleep apnea, and 50 (34.2 %) had more than one comorbidity. The percentage of excess weight loss (%EWL) was 22.7 ± 8.1, 75.1 ± 22.8, and 72.6 ± 17.5 at 1, 12, and 24 months, respectively. Fifty-five patients (37.7 %) had a 1-year %EWL of ≥80 %, and 29 (39.7 %) had a 2-year %EWL of ≥80 %. Linear regression analysis showed a strong correlation between 1-month %EWL and %EWL at 1 year (r (2) = 0.23, p < 0.001) and 2 years (r (2) = 0.28, p < 0.001). Resolution of comorbidities was associated with higher %EWL achieved at 1 year, but early postoperative weight loss did not have a significant effect on comorbidity resolution. CONCLUSIONS Early postoperative weight loss can be used to identify and target poor responders.","Obeidat, Firas; Shanti, Hiba",Obesity surgery,770,17

Because CE is indefinite, this study was designed to formulate and validate a new model of PBV based on stochastic CE distribution. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS Data were retrospectively collected on 146 peripheral blood stem cell harvests from 114 patients and donors in a single institution from April 2014 to February 2018. The training set consisted of all procedures performed from April 2014 to June 2016 and the validation set of all procedures performed from July 2016 to February 2018. A new algorithm, based on CE2 distribution of the training set, was affirmed using the validation set. The positive predictive value of the model was estimated from the expected percentage of procedures that reached the target CD34-positive dose, with predicted PBV processed as the gold standard. RESULTS The 10th and 50th percentiles of CE2 were 33.4% and 52.5%, respectively. When PBV was assorted into three categories, defined as greater than 90%, 50% to 90%, and less than 50% of procedures reaching the targeted CD34-positive dose, the positive predictive values of the new model were 100%, 70%, and 100%, respectively. CONCLUSION The new model was validated with a high positive predictive value and can reliably estimate the required PBV and the success rate corresponding to the PBV. The model can be utilized easily with a Web-based tool.","Ono, Yuichiro; Yoshioka, Satoshi; Inoue, Kazuhisa; Yoshida, Masahiro; Maruoka, Hayato; Ishikawa, Takayuki",Transfusion,770,1

Here, we report that mutant RNAs that carry an expanded CAG repeat (expanded CAG RNAs) induce apoptosis by activating the nucleolar stress pathway in both polyQ patients and transgenic animal disease models. We showed that expanded CAG RNAs interacted directly with nucleolin (NCL), a protein that regulates rRNA transcription. Such RNA-protein interaction deprived NCL of binding to upstream control element (UCE) of the rRNA promoter, which resulted in UCE DNA hypermethylation and subsequently perturbation of rRNA transcription. The down-regulation of rRNA transcription induced nucleolar stress and provoked apoptosis by promoting physical interaction between ribosomal proteins and MDM2. Consequently, p53 protein was found to be stabilized in cells and became concentrated in the mitochondria. Finally, we showed that mitochondrial p53 disrupted the interaction between the antiapoptotic protein, Bcl-xL, and the proapoptotic protein, Bak, which then caused cytochrome c release and caspase activation. Our work provides in vivo evidence that expanded CAG RNAs trigger nucleolar stress and induce apoptosis via p53 and describes a polyQ pathogenic mechanism that involves the nucleolus.","Tsoi, Ho; Lau, Terrence Chi-Kong; Tsang, Suk-Ying; Lau, Kwok-Fai; Chan, Ho Yin Edwin",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,770,30

However, no comparative studies have addressed its application to gastrectomy for advanced gastric cancer (AGC). We therefore aimed to demonstrate the safety and feasibility of single-port laparoscopic gastrectomy (SLG) for the treatment of AGC by comparing it with conventional multi-port laparoscopic gastrectomy (MLG). METHODS We searched the prospective gastric cancer database of our institute for patients with AGC who underwent SLG or MLG between October 2007 and December 2013. Cases of R2 resection with distant metastasis or concurrent surgery for comorbid malignant lesions were excluded. One-to-one propensity score matching was performed to reduce bias from confounding patient-related variables, and the short- and long-term outcomes were compared between the two groups. RESULTS We identified 216 patients who underwent SLG (n = 100) or MLG (n = 116). After propensity score matching, we selected 73 pairs of patients who underwent SLG (distal gastrectomy, 49; total gastrectomy, 24) or MLG (distal gastrectomy, 45; total gastrectomy, 28). While the mean operative times were comparable between the groups, the SLG group had less blood loss, a lower postoperative morbidity, and shorter postoperative hospital stays. The 5-year survival rates were 74.2% in the SLG group and 60.2% in the MLG group (P = 0.081 by log-rank test). CONCLUSIONS SLG is shown to be safe and feasible for the treatment of AGC, with better short-term results and acceptable oncologic outcomes and may be applicable for AGC treatment.","Omori, Takeshi; Fujiwara, Yoshiyuki; Yamamoto, Kazuyoshi; Yanagimoto, Yoshitomo; Sugimura, Keijirou; Masuzawa, Toru; Kishi, Kentarou; Takahashi, Hidenori; Yasui, Masayoshi; Miyata, Hiroshi; Ohue, Masayuki; Yano, Masahiko; Sakon, Masato",Journal of gastrointestinal surgery : official journal of the Society for Surgery of the Alimentary Tract,770,1

In Asia, the virus, more commonly referred to as COVID-19, has been spreading since the end of December. To contain the public health threat, almost all countries enforced a variety of measures, including lockdowns, to minimize face-to-face human interactions between the infected and the susceptible. While these vigilant measures save lives, they also generate a substantial negative economic shock that immediately halts demand and significantly disrupts supply, global production value chain and trade. The consequences are dire - considerable decline in output, massive surge in unemployment, countless bankruptcy cases, and unrelentless worries over financial stability. The result, a worldwide economic setback, is more severe than that experienced during the Great Financial Crisis of 2008-2009. Asia’s experiences with COVID-19 precede that in the West. This fortuitous timing allows Asia to share its learnings drawn from experiences to benefit the world.

Anti-inflammatory drugs often come with severe side effects driven by high and fluctuating drug concentrations. To remedy this, drugs with sustained anti-inflammatory responses are desirable. However, we still lack a quantitative mechanistic understanding of such sustained effects. Here, we study the anti-inflammatory response to a common glucocorticoid drug, Dexamethasone. We find a sustained response 22 hours after drug removal. With hypothesis testing using mathematical modeling, we unravel the underlying mechanism – a slow release of Dexamethasone from the receptor-drug complex. The developed model is in agreement with time-resolved training and testing data, and is used to simulate hypothetical treatment schemes. This work opens up for a more knowledge-driven drug development, to find sustained anti-inflammatory responses and fewer side effects.","Nyman, Elin; Lindh, Maria; Lövfors, William; Simonsson, Christian; Persson, Alexander; Eklund, Daniel; Bäckström, Erica; Fridén, Markus; Cedersund, Gunnar",bioRxiv,770,1

Early diagnosis plays an essential role in controlling the infection. Therefore, early and accurate SARS-CoV-2 detection assays along with easy operation are required. The aim of this study was to compare the clinical performance of the Ampdirect™ 2019-nCoV Detection Kit (SHIMADZU assay), which does not require RNA purification steps, with that of the preexisting SARS-CoV-2 detection assays, which use a purified RNA template. A total of 71 samples (65 nasopharyngeal specimens and 6 sputum specimens) were collected from 32 individuals, including patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 and those with suspected infection. The sensitivity and kappa (κ) coefficient were assessed between the SARS-CoV-2 detection assays using the reference standard, which was defined as a true positive result by any one of the four SARS-CoV-2 detection assays. The overall sensitivity and κ coefficient of the SHIMADZU assay were 86.0% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 77.9-94.2) and 0.83 (95% CI: 0.69-0.96), respectively. In particular, among the 18 samples collected within 10 days from symptom onset, the sensitivity and κ coefficient of the SHIMADZU assay were 100% and 1.0, respectively. Although a relatively small number of samples was evaluated, the SHIMADZU assay showed good analytical performance and as such would be highly useful for the detection of SARS-CoV-2. The test can be performed easily and quickly and has the potential for future applications in situations where a highly sensitive diagnosis is required. © 2021","Sato, Y.; Kondo, T.; Moriai, M.; Nirasawa, S.; Saeki, M.; Yakuwa, Y.; Katayama, Y.; Kitayama, I.; Kobayashi, R.; Endoh, A.; Asanuma, K.; Fujiya, Y.; Takahashi, S.",Journal of Laboratory Medicine,770,1

Methods Observational studies reporting at least 30 cases of COVID-19 describing disease severity or mortality were included. Meta-data of demographics, clinical symptoms, vital signs, comorbidities, and 14 clinical laboratory biomarkers on initial hospital presentation were extracted. Taking the outcome group as the analysis unit, meta-regression analysis with the generalized estimating equations (GEE) method for clustered data was performed sequentially. The unadjusted effect of each potential predictor of the three binary outcome variables (i.e., severe vs. non-severe, critically severe vs. non-critically severe, and dead vs. alive) was examined one by one by fitting three series of simple GEE logistic regression models due to missing data. The worst one was dropped one at a time. Then, a final multiple GEE logistic regression model for each of the three outcome variables was obtained. Findings Meta-data was extracted from 76 articles, reporting a total of 26,627 cases of COVID-19. Patients were recruited across 16 countries. The number of studies (patients) included in the final models of the analysis for severity, critical severity, and mortality was 38 studies (9,764 patients), 21 studies (4,792 patients), and 24 studies (14,825 patients), respectively. After adjusting for the effect of age, lymphocyte count mean or median [≤] 1.03 (estimated hazard ratio [HR] = 46.2594, p < 0.0001), smaller lymphocyte count mean or median (HR < 0.0001, p = 0.0028), and lymphocyte count mean or median [≤] 0.8714 (HR = 17.3756, p = 0.0079) were the strongest predictor of severity, critical severity, and mortality, respectively.

Unfortunately, an effective vaccine or therapeutic is not currently available, resulting in tens of thousands of hospitalizations per year. In an effort to discover a protective antibody against HPIV3, we screened the B cell repertoires from peripheral blood, tonsils, or spleen from healthy children and adults. These analyses yielded five monoclonal antibodies that potently neutralized HPIV3 in vitro. These HPIV3 neutralizing antibodies targeted two non-overlapping epitopes of the HPIV3 F protein, with most targeting the apex. Importantly, prophylactic administration of one of these antibodies, named PI3-E12, resulted in potent protection against HPIV3 infection in cotton rats. Additionally, PI3-E12 could also be used therapeutically to suppress HPIV3 in immunocompromised animals. These results demonstrate the potential clinical utility of PI3-E12 for the prevention or treatment of HPIV3 in both immunocompetent and immunocompromised individuals.","Boonyaratanakornkit, Jim; Singh, Suruchi; Weidle, Connor; Rodarte, Justas; Bakthavatsalam, Ramasamy; Perkins, Jonathan; Stewart-Jones, Guillaume B.E.; Kwong, Peter D.; McGuire, Andrew T.; Pancera, Marie; Taylor, Justin J.",bioRxiv,770,17

Using deconvolution and 3D image registration, we were able to identify fluorescently labeled membrane structures analyzed by cryo-electron tomography. In situ cryo-electron tomography of A549 cells as well as primary Human Small Airway Epithelial Cells revealed that LBs are composed of membrane sheets frequently attached to the limiting membrane through “T”-junctions. We report a so far undescribed outer membrane dome protein complex (OMDP) on the limiting membrane of LBs. Our data suggest that LB biogenesis is driven by parallel membrane sheet import and by the curvature of the limiting membrane to maximize lipid storage capacity.","Klein, Steffen; Wimmer, Benedikt H.; Winter, Sophie L.; Kolovou, Androniki; Laketa, Vibor; Chlanda, Petr",bioRxiv,770,16

A novel eHealth system is required to cope with infectious and chronic diseases. This article proposes an online eHealth system to monitor patients and provides edge computing services based on the Internet of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). In order to minimize the health monitoring latency and guarantee the resource utilization efficiency of UAVs, the Lyapunov optimization method is utilized to decompose the long-term optimization problem into a series of instantaneous optimization problems. Then the decomposed sub-problem is formulated as a minimum cost maximum flow problem by constructing a bipartite graph that maps medical analysis requests to target UAVs. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our system. Finally, system analyses illustrate that the robustness and scalability of our eHealth system is favorable, and our system can provide agile edge computing services for dispersed patients.","Dong, Peiran Wang Yongjian Zhaolong Ning Obaidat Mohammad S.",IEEE Wireless Communications,770,5

These drugs may be protective across a range of respiratory infections including bacterial and viral pneumonias. We examined long-term use of ACEi/ARBs on the risk of first pneumonia hospitalization and pneumonia-related death in Chinese patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D). Methods: Prospective analysis of 16,285 Chinese T2D patients with new RASi use observed between 2001 and 2019. Overlap weighting was performed to balance baseline characteristics. We used time-dependent Cox model to estimate the hazard ratio (HR) of outcomes while adjusting for the time-varying covariates. Results: There were 6,379 (39.2%) ACEi-users only, 4,065 (25.0%) ARBs-users and 5,841 (35.9%) non RASi-users. During a median observation of 7.6 years, 6.1% had first pneumonia hospitalization, 1.3% died during or within one month of pneumonia hospitalization and 17.6% died from other causes. No association was observed between RASi use and first pneumonia hospitalization. However, RASi-users had lower risk for pneumonia-related death (HR 0.51, 95% CI 0.35-0.76) than non-users [ACEi-users only: HR 0.53 (0.34-0.81);ARBs-users: HR 0.58 (0.32-1.04)]. We also noted reduced risk for all-cause death in RASi-users (HR 0.60, 95% CI 0.54-0.67) [ACEi-users only: HR 0.61 (0.54-0.69);ARBs-users: HR 0.67 (0.57-0.79)]. Conclusions: Long-term use of RASi was associated with reduced risk of pneumonia-related death and all-cause death, but not first pneumonia hospitalization, in Chinese patients with T2D. Relevance to other respiratory infections such as coronavirus-disease 2019 (COVID-19) merits further investigation.","Shi, Mai Yang Aimin Lau Eric Sh Wu Hongjiang Fan Baoqi Kong Alice P.; Luk, Andrea Ma Ronald C.; Chan, Juliana C.; Chow, Elaine",Diabetes,770,8

Miles et al. (2020) argue that the March-June UK lockdown was more costly than the benefit of lives saved, evaluated using the NICE threshold of {\pounds}30000 for a quality-adjusted life year (QALY) and that the costs of a lockdown for 13 weeks from mid-June would be vastly greater than any plausible estimate of the benefits, even if easing produced a second infection wave causing over 7000 deaths weekly by mid-September. I note here two key problems that significantly affect their estimates and cast doubt on their conclusions. Firstly, their calculations arbitrarily cut off after 13 weeks, without costing the epidemic end state. That is, they assume indifference between mid-September states of 13 or 7500 weekly deaths and corresponding infection rates. This seems indefensible unless one assumes that (a) there is little chance of any effective vaccine or improved medical or social interventions for the foreseeable future, (b) notwithstanding temporary lockdowns, COVID-19 will very likely propagate until herd immunity. Even under these assumptions it is very questionable. Secondly, they ignore the costs of serious illness, possible long-term lowering of life quality and expectancy for survivors. These are uncertain, but plausibly at least as large as the costs in deaths. In summary, policy on tackling COVID-19 cannot be rationally made without estimating probabilities of future medical interventions and long-term illness costs. More work on modelling these uncertainties is urgently needed.","Kent, Adrian",,770,10

Impact of viral infections is not only due to the direct effects of viral replication, but also to immunologically-mediated lung injury that may lead to acute rejection and chronic lung allograft dysfunction. This has particularly been seen in infections caused by herpesviruses and respiratory viruses. The implementation of universal preventive measures against cytomegalovirus (CMV) and influenza (by means of antiviral prophylaxis and vaccination, respectively) and administration of early antiviral treatment have reduced the burden of these diseases and potentially their role in affecting allograft outcomes. New antivirals against CMV for prophylaxis and for treatment of antiviral-resistant CMV infection are currently being evaluated in transplant recipients, and may continue to improve the management of CMV in lung transplant recipients. However, new therapeutic and preventive strategies are highly needed for other viruses such as respiratory syncytial virus or parainfluenza virus, including new antivirals and vaccines. This is particularly important in the advent of the COVID-19 pandemic, for which several unanswered questions remain, in particular on the best antiviral and immunomodulatory regimen for decreasing mortality specifically in lung transplant recipients. In conclusion, the appropriate management of viral complications after transplantation remain an essential step to continue improving survival and quality of life of lung transplant recipients.","Munting, A.; Manuel, O.",Journal of Thoracic Disease,770,26

Ostracism leads to serious psychological distress and health issues in the young adults being ostracized. However, there are no psychometrically designed instruments to measure this phenomenon in young adults. This study aims to develop a scale that measures ostracism efficiently and establishes the scale’s psychometric properties. Design/methodology/approach: The research design used for the study is “a mixed-method study using non-experimental research with an exploratory sequential approach and instrument development design.” For the formation of the item pool, theoretical evidence was collected and focus group discussions were conducted. Afterward, content validity was established with the help of subject matter experts, followed by Velicer’s minimum average partial method and maximum likelihood factor analysis to form the instrument’s factorial structure. Findings: Velicer’s minimum average partial method and maximum likelihood factor analysis made two factors as follows: ostracism experience and psychological effect. The instrument developed has a high value of alpha reliability i.e. a = 0.97 and a = 0.96, a = 0.92 for the subscales, respectively. Research limitations/implications: The sample used for the research was enough to run the analysis, but future studies can go for a more extensive and more diverse sample. The sample was based solely on university students. The current research focused only on the target of the phenomenon, and the whole research process was conducted online because of the Covid-19 pandemic going on. The scale developed can be used in several settings to find out if the individual is being ostracized or not. Practical implications: The scale’s most important implication is in the colleges and universities where young adults are found and face this problem daily. Likewise, psychologists can also use it in clinical settings. The other important implication of this scale is that it is opening a route to future research as different variables can be studied in ostracism such as depression, physical health and anxiety. Social implications: Ostracism is a hidden evil in societies that is not usually talked about. When people are not given equal importance in groups or settings, it leads to serious psychological issues in those individuals. This scale will in the identification of the problem that will lead to a proper solution to this evil. Originality/value: This work is original and not copied from anywhere. The research was conducted with the sole purpose of developing a scale on the ostracism experiences in young adults. The data is collected in the form of online surveys. The current scale is an attempt at developing a more reliable and valid scale that can be used in social settings. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Shahzad, B.; Aqeel, M.; Naseer, H.; Khan, M.

People can find doctors for diagnosis and treatment by the name of the disease online. However, patients usually lack professional medical knowledge and have their own subjective preferences for health services, which makes it difficult for patients to accurately find a doctor that suits them. To this end, we proposed a medical guidance model driven by subjective and objective knowledge to provide decision support to patients. In the proposed model, the doctor's and disease's own information is regarded as objective knowledge, and the information of doctor feature extracted from patient reviews is regarded as subjective knowledge. They are fused into a knowledge graph. On this basis, a knowledge decision engine is designed to recommend the most suitable doctor based on the patient's objective conditions and subjective preferences. Finally, a prototype system is designed and developed to demonstrate the feasibility of the model as above. The system guides patients to improve their objective conditions and subjective preferences through inquiries, and returns recommended doctors to patients in an interpretable manner. The medical guidance model can effectively meet the personalized and professional needs of patients in online medical services, which has good practical value under the digital healthcare continues to become the trend of the future. © 2021 IEEE.","Yu, H.; Xiao, L.","2021 IEEE International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Industrial Design, AIID 2021",770,1

While vaccination still lowers the risk of infection, similar viral loads in vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals infected with Delta question how much vaccination prevents onward transmission. Methods We performed a retrospective observational cohort study of contacts of SARS-CoV-2-infected index cases using contact testing data from England. We used multivariable logistic regression to investigate the impact of index case and contact vaccination on transmission, and how this varies with Alpha and Delta variants (classified using S-gene detection/calendar trends) and time since second vaccination. Results 51,798/139,164(37.2%) contacts tested were PCR-positive. Two doses of BNT162b2 or ChAdOx1 vaccines in Alpha variant index cases independently reduced PCR-positivity in contacts (aOR, adjusted odds ratio vs. unvaccinated=0.18[95%CI 0.12-0.29] and 0.37[0.22-0.63] respectively). The Delta variant attenuated vaccine-associated reductions in transmission: two BNT162b2 doses reduced Delta transmission (aOR=0.35[0.26-0.48]), more than ChAdOx1 (aOR=0.64[0.57-0.72]; heterogeneity p<0.001). Variation in viral load (Ct values) explained only a modest proportion of vaccine-associated transmission reductions. Transmission reductions declined over time since second vaccination, for Delta reaching similar levels to unvaccinated individuals by 12 weeks for ChAdOx1 and attenuating substantially for BNT162b2. Protection from vaccination in contacts also declined in the 3 months after second vaccination. Conclusions Vaccination reduces transmission of Delta, but by less than the Alpha variant. The impact of vaccination decreased over time. Factors other than PCR-measured viral load are important in vaccine-associated transmission reductions. Booster vaccinations may help control transmission together with preventing infections.","Eyre, D. W.; Taylor, D.; Purver, M.; Chapman, D.; Fowler, T.; Pouwels, K.; Walker, A. S.; Peto, T. E.",,770,1

Findings from factor analysis clustered SME policy preferences into three groups: policy preferences related to financing and liquidity constraints, market related and tax preferences. This study discusses some policy and managerial implications urging the need for more nuanced and variegated understanding of the effect of coronavirus pandemic on SMEs.","Krasniqi, B.

Our group, and others, have shown that scaffolds derived from plants can be utilized for tissue engineering applications in biomedicine and in the burgeoning cultured meat industry. Such scaffolds are ideally straightforward and inexpensive to prepare, allowing researchers to take advantage of their intrinsic 3D microarchitectures. These efforts inspired us to continue to pursue the development of novel and unconventional biomaterials that are easily produced and high performing in vitro. With this in mind, few plant-derived materials are more ubiquitous than bread. Having observed the porosity of the crumb (i.e. the internal bulk) we sought to investigate whether it might support the proliferation of mammalian cells in vitro. Here, we develop and validate a yeast-free “soda bread” that maintains its mechanical stability over several weeks in culture conditions. Importantly, we also demonstrate that control over the mechanical stability of the scaffold can also be achieved with both chemical and enzymatic means. The scaffolding is a heterogeneous and complex structure of isolated and interconnected pores which allow for the proliferation of multiple cell types. We demonstrate here that mouse fibroblasts, myoblasts and pre-osteoblasts are able to proliferate up to four weeks in culture. Immunohistochemistry demonstrates that the fibroblasts are able to deposit their own fibronectin extracellular matrix and that mouse myoblasts are able to differentiate and fuse into myotubes. Although the pre-osteoblasts proliferated over the course of four weeks their ability to differentiate was inconclusive. Metabolic analyses of proliferation, cytotoxicity and oxidative stress reveal that cells remain highly viable and functional on these novel bread scaffolds. While the results presented in this proof-of-concept study create many new questions and opportunities, the results open up novel possibilities in the development of edible scaffolds that may be utilized in future food applications. Bread derived scaffolds represent a surprising alternative to synthetic or animal-derived scaffolds for addressing a diverse variety of tissue engineering challenges in food science. Future studies will delve deeper into investigating these how possibilities might take advantage of the immense breadth of knowledge about bread making and examine their applicability in the development of lab grown foods and broader applications in cellular agriculture.","Holmes, Jessica T.; Jaberansari, Ziba; Collins, William; Latour, Maxime Leblanc; Modulevsky, Daniel J.; Pelling, Andrew E.",bioRxiv,770,16

Herein, we summarized data resulted from the Lean model adoption in an Emergency Department of the Lombardy region, the Italian epicenter of the pandemic, to critically appraise its effectiveness and feasibility. The Lean algorithm was applied in the Humanitas Clinical and Research Hospital, Milan, north of Italy. At admission, patients underwent outdoor pre-triage for fever, respiratory, and gastrointestinal symptoms, with a focus on SpO2. Based on these data, they were directed to the most appropriate area for the COVID-19 first-level screening. High-risk patients were assisted by trained staff for second-level screening and planning of treatment. Out of 7.778 patients, 21.9% were suspected of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Mortality was 21.9% and the infection rate in health workers was 4.8%. The lean model has proved to be effective in optimizing the overall management of COVID-19 patients in an emergency setting. It allowed for screening of a large volume of patients, while also limiting the health workers’ infection rate.

In response, the Incorporated Research Institutions for Seismology Education and Outreach program, in collaboration with Miami University, offered a free online Seismology Skill Building Workshop to increase undergraduates' knowledge, skills, self-efficacy, and interest in observational seismology and scientific computing. Registrations were received from 760 undergraduates representing 60 different countries. U.S. participants consisted of 59% women and 29% from populations traditionally underrepresented in the geosciences. The workshop design consisted of a tailored Linux virtual machine, regular webinars, a Slack workspace, tutorial-style active e-learning assignments, and an optional final project. Every other week for 12 weeks, a module with ∼6 assignments was released to build skills with Linux, Generic Mapping Tools, Seismic Analysis Code, webservices, seismic network processing, Python, ObsPy, and Jupyter notebooks. A final module focused on competitiveness for graduate school, summer internships, and professional jobs. Evaluation of the workshop relied on registration data, pre- and post-workshop surveys, and performance data from the learning management system. 440 participants completed at least one assignment, 224 completed at least 80% of the assignments, and 191 completed all 35 assignments, significantly higher than most comparable large-scale, open-access courses. Participants invested ∼6 hrs per week and averaged a score of 88%on assignments. We identified > 60%normalized gain in scientific computing skills. There is evidence that the inclusive design of the workshop was able to attract and retain a diverse population. However, some additional investigation is needed to ensure that benefits were evenly experienced. Regardless of the degree of completion, participants perceived the workshop quite positively: On average 96%described it as high to very high quality, 83%satisfied to very satisfiedwith their experience, and 70%very likely to recommend to peers.

In contrast, the quality of such T cell responses has been poorly investigated, in particular in the case of CD8+ T cells. Here, we explored the quality of SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8+ T cell responses in individuals who recovered from mild symptomatic infections, through which protective immunity should develop, by functional characterization of their T cell receptor (TCR) repertoire. CD8+ T cell responses specific for SARS-CoV-2-derived epitopes were low in frequency but could be detected robustly early as well as late - up to twelve months - after infection. A pool of immunodominant epitopes, which accurately identified previous SARSCoV- 2 infections, was used to isolate TCRs specific for epitopes restricted by common HLA class I molecules. TCR-engineered T cells showed heterogeneous functional avidity and cytotoxicity towards virus-infected target cells. High TCR functionality correlated with gene signatures of T cell function and activation that, remarkably, could be retrieved for each epitope:HLA combination and patient analyzed. Overall, our data demonstrate that highly functional HLA class I TCRs are recruited and maintained upon mild SARS-CoV-2 infection. Such validated epitopes and TCRs could become valuable tools for the development of diagnostic tests determining the quality of SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8+ T cell immunity, and thereby investigating correlates of protection, as well as to restore functional immunity through therapeutic transfer of TCR-engineered T cells.","Wagner, K.

The causes of these disturbances, also occurring during training, remain unclear. Viruses such as rhinovirus, adenovirus and para-influenza virus are frequently reported as the source of URTI. However, in a few comprehensive laboratory and epidemiological studies which reported at least a 30% incidence of URTI, no identifiable pathogens were either reported or studied. A recent, longitudinal study investigated symptomatology and pathogenic etiology in sedentary controls, recreational and elite athletes. The highest incidence of URTI occurred in elite athletes. However; only 11 out of 37 illness episodes overall had pathogenic origins, and most of the unidentified upper respiratory illnesses were shorter in duration and less severe than infectious ones. This concept of inflammation without infection in athletes is quite new and leads us to consider other explanatory pathophysiological conditions. Increases in airway neutrophils, eosinophils and lymphocytes have been described under resting conditions in endurance sports, swimmers and cross-country skiers. These inflammatory patterns may be due to pollutants or chlorine-related compounds in swimmers. After intense exercise similar airways cellular profiles have been reported, with a high amount of bronchial epithelial cells. This increase in airway inflammatory cells in athletes can result from a hyperventilation-induced increase in airway osmolarity stimulating bronchial epithelial cells to release chemotactic factors. Fortunately, in most cases, these inflammatory cells express rather low level of adhesion molecules, explaining why airway inflammation may appear blunted in athletes despite numerous inflammatory cellular elements. However it can be hypothesized that a transient loss of control of this local inflammation, due to various external physico-chemical strains, might occur. This might account for some of the unidentified upper respiratory illnesses.","Bermon, Stéphane",Exercise immunology review,770,10

Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) is a well described and documented condition that is associated with the active or recent COVID-19 infection. A similar presentation in adults is termed as Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in Adults (MIS-A). With only very limited cases reported from the west, MIS-A is considered a rare and serious complication of COVID-19. However, it is not as uncommon as we think. Many cases go undiagnosed for lack of COVID -19 like symptoms and unawareness among treating clinicians about this newer clinical entity. Further, antibody testing and inflammatory markers are not easily available in many of the Indian hospitals especially in rural India where the second wave had been intense, thereby making it difficult for the diagnosis of MIS-A. Also, there is no clear treatment guideline for MIS-A unlike MIS-C where the treatment protocol is well laid out. Awareness about MIS-A among treating clinicians can thus help in further evaluation and increased identification of the syndrome at the early stages thereby helping in the early institution of treatment. Our tertiary COVID care hospital in South India which has handled about 5200 cases of COVID-19 is been able to identify 04 cases of MIS-A proving that this clinical entity is not as rare as it is thought but lacks reporting and prompt identification.

This prompted us to perform a case-control study to investigate the relationship of ACE2 polymorphisms with CHD (coronary heart disease) and MI (myocardial infarction). Three single nucleotide polymorphisms in the ACE2 gene (1075A/G, 8790A/G and 16854G/C) were genotyped by PCR-RFLP (restriction-fragment-length polymorphism) in 811 patients with CHD (of which 508 were patients with MI) and 905 normal controls in a Chinese population. The polymorphisms were in linkage disequilibrium (r(2)=0.854-0.973). Analyses were conducted by gender, because the ACE2 gene is on the X chromosome. In females, an association was detected with MI for 1075A/G (P=0.026; odds ratio=1.98) and 16854G/C (P=0.028; odds ratio=1.97) in recessive models after adjusting for covariates.

Five anti-TNF drugs as well as four biological drugs with a different mechanism of action (abatacept, rituximab, and two IL-6 inhibitors) are currently registered for the treatment of RA. In the past two years, Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors have been introduced in the clinical management of RA, namely tofacitinib, baricitinib, upadacitinib, and filgotinib. They are small molecules of non-biological origin which enter the cell and inhibit signal transduction. Biological or targeted therapy of RA is indicated in the case of failure of conventional treatment and when there is at least moderate or high RA activity. Five anti-TNF drugs are indicated in the treatment of spondyloarthritides. They have been shown to be equally effective except for etanercept which is not effective for a coexisting inflammatory bowel disease. Recently, the IL-17 inhibitors secukinumab and ixekizumab have been introduced in the treatment of axial spondyloarthritis. Their efficacy on the locomotor system is similar to that of anti-TNF, but they are more effective in treating psoriasis. In the treatment of psoriatic arthritis, TNF inhibitors as well as IL-12/23 axis modulators and interleu¬kin-17 inhibitors have been introduced. Furthermore, targeted synthetic drugs are used in the treatment of PsA, namely the phosphodiesterase-4 inhibitor apremilast, whose efficacy is lower, and the newly introduced JAK1/3 inhibitor tofacitinib.

Little is known about the predisposing factors of this infection. The aim of this study was to explore an association between the serum vitamin D level, obesity, and underlying health conditions, as well as the vulnerability to COVID-19 in the Iranian population. METHODS: We conducted a case-control study of 201 patients with coronavirus infection and 201 controls. Cases and controls were matched for age and gender. The study was carried out for 2 months (February 2020-April 2020) at Imam Khomeini Hospital Complex, Tehran, Iran. Serum 25(OH) vitamin D was measured using the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay method. Information containing age, gender, clinical symptoms, body mass index, computed tomography scan findings, and underlying health conditions related to each participant were elicited from health records. RESULTS: A significant negative correlation (p = .02) was observed between the serum vitamin D level and developing coronavirus infection. Also, the results showed that the COVID-19 cases were more likely to be overweight than the controls (p = .023). Diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and respiratory infections were found in 20.89%, 9.65%, and 6.96% of cases, respectively.

In medium infections individuals have the virus and exhibit symptoms, however hospitalization is not necessary, in severe infections, individuals are hospitalized, have high pathology and in some cases progress to death. The virus is formed by simple positive RNA, enveloped, non-segmented, and presenting the largest genome of viruses constituting 32 Kb, consisting of envelope proteins, membrane, nucleocapsid and spike protein, which is essential in the interaction with the host cells. As for the origin of this virus, research has been intensified to determine this paradox and although the similarity with SARS-CoV, this virus did not has necessarily the same place of origin.

The Papain-like protease (PLpro) is a domain of Nsp3 - a large multidomain protein that is an essential component of the replication-transcription complex, making it a good therapeutic target. PLpro is a multi-functional protein encoded in coronaviruses that can cleave viral polyproteins, poly-ubiquitin and protective Interferon Stimulated Gene 15 product, ISG15, which mimics a head-to-tail linked ubiquitin (Ub) dimer. PLpro across coronavirus families showed divergent selectivity for recognition and cleavage of these protein substrates despite sequence conservation. However, it is not clear how sequence changes in SARS-CoV-2 PLpro alter its selectivity for substrates and what outcome this has on the pathogenesis of the virus. We show that SARS-CoV-2 PLpro preferentially binds ISG15 over Ub and K48-linked Ub2. We determined crystal structures of PLpro in complex with human K48-Ub2 and ISG15 revealing that dual domain recognition of ISG15 drives substrate selectivity over Ub and Ub2. We also characterized the PLpro substrate interactions using solution NMR, cross-linking mass spectrometry to support that ISG15 is recognized via two domains while Ub2 binds primarily through one Ub domain. Finally, energetic analysis of the binding interfaces between PLpro from SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 with ISG15 and Ub2 define the sequence determinants for how PLpros from different coronaviruses recognize two topologically distinct substrates and how evolution of the protease altered its substrate selectivity. Our work reveals how PLpro substrate selectivity may evolve in PLpro coronaviruses variants enabling design of more effective therapeutics.","Osipiuk, Jerzy; Wydorski, Pawel M; Lanham, Benjamin T; Tesar, Christine; Endres, Michael; Engle, Elizabeth; Jedrzejczak, Robert; Mullapudi, Vishruth; Michalska, Karolina; Fidelis, Krzysztof; Fushman, David; Joachimiak, Andrzej; Joachimiak, Lukasz A.",,770,21

These viral sequences or 'viromes' encode viruses that populate the Earth's oceans [2, 3] and terrestrial environments [4, 5], where their infections impact life across diverse ecological niches and scales [6, 7], including humans [8-10]. Most viruses have yet to be isolated and cultured [11-13], and surprisingly few efforts have explored what analysis of available data might reveal about their nature. Here, we compiled and analyzed seven decades of one-step growth and other data for viruses from six major families, including their infections of archaeal, bacterial and eukaryotic hosts [14-191]. We found that the use of host cell biomass for virus production was highest for archaea at 10%, followed by bacteria at 1% and eukarya at 0.01%, highlighting the degree to which viruses of archaea and bacteria exploit their host cells. For individual host cells, the yield of virus progeny spanned a relatively narrow range (10-1000 infectious particles per cell) compared with the million-fold difference in size between the smallest and largest cells. Furthermore, healthy and infected host cells were remarkably similar in the time they needed to multiply themselves or their virus progeny. Specifically, the doubling time of healthy cells and the delay time for virus release from infected cells were not only correlated (r = 0.71, p < 10-10, n = 101); they also spanned the same range from tens of minutes to about a week. These results have implications for better understanding the growth, spread and persistence of viruses in complex natural habitats that abound with diverse hosts, including humans and their associated microbes.","Jin, Tianyi; Yin, John",Integr Biol (Camb),770,9

However, at no time it was used the desirable community perspective and community participation throughout the process as it has been successfully done in other settings. Subsequently, with the closure of health centers, it ceased to be provided in some autonomous communities, when all the attention was transferred to the hospital setting. This exacerbated hospital-centrism, to the detriment of PHC and Home Care, is showing a high contagion in healthcare professionals. The circulation of professionals in the hospitals, where the main focus of infection is concentrated, and from these to their homes is a clear risk factor. In addition, we must not forget that Home Care is of special importance for the care of people with terminal illnesses or very advanced chronic diseases (dementia, COPD ...), although always taking into account recommendations tending to extreme precautions for infection for professionals, family and caregivers. This can be adapted to the pandemic situation by using tools that digital health offers (telephone care, video calls ...). Finally, it would be very interesting that, once the crisis was over, research was carried out that allowed the incorporation of people who have been treated by the health service during the pandemic, through the technique called public participation in research projects.","Ramón Martínez Riera, José; Gras-Nieto, Elvira",Enferm. clin.

We aimed to assess temporal trends in primary care-recorded common mental illness, episodes of self-harm, psychotropic medication prescribing, and general practitioner (GP) referrals to mental health services during the COVID-19 emergency in the UK. METHODS: We did a population-based cohort study using primary care electronic health records from general practices registered on the UK Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD). We included patient records from Jan 1, 2010, to Sept 10, 2020, to establish long-term trends and patterns of seasonality, but focused primarily on the period January, 2019-September, 2020. We extracted data on clinical codes entered into patient records to estimate the incidence of depression and anxiety disorders, self-harm, prescriptions for antidepressants and benzodiazepines, and GP referrals to mental health services, and assessed event rates of all psychotropic prescriptions and self-harm. We used mean-dispersion negative binomial regression models to predict expected monthly incidence and overall event rates, which were then compared with observed rates to assess the percentage reduction in incidence and event rates after March, 2020. We also stratified analyses by sex, age group, and practice-level Index of Multiple Deprivation quintiles. FINDINGS: We identified 14â210â507 patients from 1697 UK general practices registered in the CPRD databases. In April, 2020, compared with expected rates, the incidence of primary care-recorded depression had reduced by 43·0% (95% CI 38·3-47·4), anxiety disorders by 47·8% (44·3-51·2), and first antidepressant prescribing by 36·4% (33·9-38·8) in English general practices. Reductions in first diagnoses of depression and anxiety disorders were largest for adults of working age (18-44 and 45-64 years) and for patients registered at practices in more deprived areas. The incidence of self-harm was 37·6% (34·8-40·3%) lower than expected in April, 2020, and the reduction was greatest for women and individuals aged younger than 45 years. By September, 2020, rates of incident depression, anxiety disorder, and self-harm were similar to expected levels. In Northern Ireland, Scotland, and Wales, rates of incident depression and anxiety disorder remained around a third lower than expected to September, 2020. In April, 2020, the rate of referral to mental health services was less than a quarter of the expected rate for the time of year (75·3% reduction [74·0-76·4]).

The putative sequence of the TMDs is obtained using 20 available secondary structure prediction programs (SSPPs) with different lengths of the overall amino acid sequence of the protein as input. The results support the notion of four helical TMDs. Whilst the region of the first TMDs leaves room for speculation about an additional TMD, the other three TMDs are consistently predicted. Structural features and the role of each of the TMDs is proposed by applying pairwise sequence alignment using BLAST on the level (i) protein sequence alignment and consequent (ii) function-related alignment. Sequence identity with those TMDs of proteins involved in Ca-homeostasis and generation of replication vesicles, such as Nsp3 of corona viruses, murine coronavirus especially mouse hepatitis virus (MEW), middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS), severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and SARS-CoV-2, are suggested.

Poston. Poston supervised a team of nurses as they cared for soldiers serving with the American Expeditionary Forces during World War I in France. Poston and her nurses worked in the first American specialized neuropsychiatric hospital in a war. The soldiers they treated primarily had functional nervous disorders described at that time as ""shell shock"" or ""war neuroses."" The traumatized officers and enlisted men were considered capable of being cured and returned to active duty based on research done by American psychiatrists among British troops during the first 3 years of the war. The story of Poston's career prior, during, and after the war and her work with other nurses during a global war are significant in psychiatric nursing history. Bringing this hitherto missing piece of psychiatric and nursing history into the light gives us a unique opportunity to recognize Poston and the nurses who served with her, even as today we recognize the nurses who serve during the global COVID-19 pandemic.

Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) transplantation is emerging as a promising strategy to alleviate the neuropathic pain conditions induced by peripheral nerve injury. The aim of this systematic review was to assess the efficacy and safety of MSCs transplantation in neuropathic pain induced by peripheral nerve injury in controlled animal studies, and thus to yield evidence-based decision making. Following the PRISMA guidelines, PubMED, Cochrane Central Library, Embase and CINAHL were searched for preclinical controlled animal studies from the inception to April 16th, 2020. Seventeen studies are included in this review. Substantial heterogeneity is observed regarding the animal's species, models of neuropathic pain, regimen of MSCs transplantation and outcome of measures across the included studies. Both mechanical allodynia and thermal hyperalgesia could be significantly attenuated by transplanted MSCs. The MSCs-elicited analgesic effect is independent on type of MSCs, time of administration, and route of delivery, and is efficiently enhanced by genetic transfection with fibroblast growth factor, proenkephalin and glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor. The migration of MSCs after intrathecal or intravenous injection has been shown to be directed towards the surface of dorsal spinal cord or dorsal root ganglions on the ipsilateral side of injury. No adverse effects have been reported. The accumulating evidence demonstrates the therapeutic effect of MSCs-based cell therapy on prevention and alleviation of the neuropathic pain induced by peripheral nerve injury in rat or mouse models. The robust preclinical studies are deserved to optimize the regimen of MSCs transplantation, and to promote the translation of this potentially MSCs-based therapeutic approach into clinical studies.","Wang, Qian; He, Hongchen; Xie, Shuhang; Wei, Quan; He, Chengqi",Stem cells dev,770,20

PA preserves privacy and reduces the communication cost while maintaining the performance without additional complexity. We validated our method on 38,000 skin lesion images collected from 4 publicly available datasets.

The ability to activate and enhance the immune system makes this versatile vitamin a prospective therapeutic agent amid the current situation of coronavirus disease (COVID-19). Being highly effective against the influenza virus, causing the common cold, vitamin C may also function against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and its associated complications. Severe infections need higher doses of the vitamin to compensate for the augmented inflammatory response and metabolic demand that commonly occur during COVID-19. Compelling evidence also suggests that a high dose of vitamin C (1.5 g/kg body weight) in inflammatory conditions can result in effective clinical outcomes and thus can be employed to combat COVID-19. However, further studies are crucial to delineate the mechanism underlying the action of vitamin C against COVID-19.

Cohort was classified according to Ct into three: Group 1 >30.0, Group 2 25.0-29.9 and Group 3 <25.0. Descriptive statistics are presented. Results: 873 adults (men 651, women 222) were enrolled. The mean age in men was 38.2±18y and women 41.2±19y. Group 3 patients were significantly older (42.4±19y) than Group 2(39.5±18) and Group 1(39.3±17y). Co-morbiditieshypertension, diabetes, obstructive lung disease- were more in Group 3 as were shortness of breath at admission and lymphopenia.

This study focuses on a review of historical literature and biblical texts around monarchy and the episcopacy in light of current media articles related to COVID-19. It found that politics and policy need to be grounded into the more fundamental aspects of our human condition and that it is the compassion and care people have for those who are more fragile: be it financially, physically, mentally or spiritually, that bishops and monarchs should be embodying in a time of COVID-19. Contribution: This study drew its key insights from contested historical thoughts on the role of monarchs and bishops. The results of this line of thinking challenge us as we consider the future function and role of these positions, and what they mean in times of crises.

The potential causes of coagulopathy are inflammation, platelet activation, endothelial dysfunction, and stasis. The thrombotic events including pulmonary embolism, deep venous thrombosis as well as intracatheter thrombosis are more likely to develop in patients infected with severe form of SARS-CoV-2 who are admitted to ICU. Furthermore, these events contribute to multi-organ failure. CASE PRESENTATION: Herein, we report a case of an immunocompromised COVID-19 elderly patient with acute lymphocytic leukemia who developed myocardial infarction with ST elevation in the setting of acute pulmonary thromboembolism in the presence of zero platelet count. Despite successful urgent coronary revascularization and platelet transfusion, the patient eventually died after failed resuscitation efforts. CONCLUSION: Patients with COVID-19 infection are at a greater risk of developing cardiovascular complications, but their appropriate management can decrease the risk of fatal events. Coronary thrombosis associated with pulmonary thromboembolism in the setting of thrombocytopenia is a rare and a complex to manage condition. Significance of single antiplatelet agent in STEMI with thrombocytopenia merits further studies. According to expert opinions and literature reviews, we must avoid dual antiplatelet therapy in these patients and keep platelet transfusion as a standard therapy to avoid drastic bleeding complications.","Hashemi, Arash; Gerges, Fady; Naqvi, Haseeb Raza; Kotlar, Irina; Moscatelli, Sara; Hashemi, Ashkan; Rustamova, Yasmin; Almaghraby, Abdallah",Egypt Heart J,770,20

Plants accumulate Se and thus represent a major source of Se to consumers. Agronomic biofortification intends to enrich crops with Se in order to secure its adequate supply by people. Scope: The goal of this review is to report the present knowledge of the distribution and processes of Se in soil and at the plant-soil interface, and of Se behaviour inside the plant in terms of biofortification. It aims to unravel the Se metabolic pathways that affect the nutritional value of edible plant products, various Se biofortification strategies in challenging environments, as well as the impact of Se-enriched food on human health. Conclusions: Agronomic biofortification and breeding are prevalent strategies for battling Se deficiency. Future research addresses nanosized Se biofortification, crop enrichment with multiple micronutrients, microbial-integrated agronomic biofortification, and optimization of Se biofortification in adverse conditions. Biofortified food of superior nutritional quality may be created, enriched with healthy Se-compounds, as well as several other valuable phytochemicals.

In this review, we summarize the current uses of RTMUS to diagnose and manage cardiovascular dysfunction and discuss expanded and future uses. Materials and Methods: We performed a literature search (PubMed and EMBase) to access articles related to RTMUS echo. We reviewed articles for selection using Covidence, a web-based tool for managing systematic reviews and data were extracted using a separate standardized collection form. Results: Our search yielded 15 articles. Twelve of these articles demonstrated the feasibility of having a novice sonographer mentored by a tele-expert in obtaining a variety of cardiac ultrasound views. The articles discussed different technological specifications for the RTMUS system, but all showed that adequate images were able to be obtained. Overall, RTMUS echo was found to be a positive intervention that contributed to patient care. Conclusion: RTMUS echo allows for rapid access to diagnostic imaging in various clinical settings. RTMUS echo can help in assessing patients that may require a higher level of isolation precautions or in other resource-constrained environments. In the future, identifying the least expensive way to utilize RTMUS echo will be important.","Salerno, Alexis; Kuhn, Diane; El Sibai, Rayan; Levine, Andrea R; McCurdy, Michael T",Medicina (Kaunas),770,29

The debate includes claims that sheltering in place influences deaths unrelated to infection or other natural causes. Testing this claim should improve the benefit/cost accounting that informs choice on reimposing sheltering in place. We used time-series methods to compare weekly nonnatural deaths in California with those in Florida. California was the first state to begin, and among the last to end, sheltering in place, while sheltering began later and ended earlier in Florida. During weeks when California had shelter-in-place orders in effect, but Florida did not, the odds that a nonnatural death occurred in California rather than Florida were 14.4% below expected levels. Sheltering-in-place policies likely reduce mortality from mechanisms unrelated to infection or other natural causes of death.","Catalano, Ralph; Glymour, M Maria; Chen, Yea-Hung; Bibbins-Domingo, Kirsten",Am J Epidemiol,770,16

Regardless of the strength of health care infrastructure across different economies, all countries are diverting their resources toward care for COVID-19 patients. AIM: The aim of this survey was to evaluate the pattern of care of gynaecologic cancers in a developing country during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: An anonymous survey consisting of 20 questions intended for the gynaecologic cancer care providers with emphasis on their current practice and approach to their patients was distributed online via social media from April 30 to May 31, 2020. Basic descriptive statistics were applied. RESULTS: Among a total of 61 respondents, 63.9% were gynaecologic oncologists, 18.0% were radiation oncologists and 18.0% were medical oncologists. Majority, that is, 95.1% health care professionals felt that COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant change on their practice pattern and 56.2% practitioners had stopped registering new cases of cancer. In 75.4% centers surgery was being done for gynaecologic cancer cases and among them 60.8% were doing surgery only for cases requiring immediate intervention. Among the centers providing chemotherapy, 39.1% had switched to oral drugs. Among the centers providing radiation, 40.9% were providing radiation to cases based on their type and urgency and 9.0% had implemented hypofractionation. In early stage low risk cases, majority, that is, 34.0% centers were managing as before. In early stage high-risk cases, 32.6% centers were managing as before. In advanced stage endometrial cancer cases, 28.8% had postponed any treatment and 28.8% administered chemotherapy. In early stage, epithelial ovarian cancer 65.9% centers were performing complete staging of the disease. In advanced stage epithelial ovarian cancer, 65.9% centers preferred biopsy followed by neoadjuvant chemotherapy and 11.3% centers performed primary debulking surgery. In cases of interval debulking surgery, 73.3% centers deferred surgery till all six cycles of chemotherapy was completed. In cases of recurrent ovarian cancer amenable for secondary debulking surgery, 38.6% preferred chemotherapy. In early stage cervical cancer, surgical treatment was provided in 46.5% centers. In locally advanced cervical cancer, chemoradiation was given in 65.9% centers. In cases of metastatic cervical cancer, 46.6% centers were performing palliative radiation.

This infection was first reported in Wuhan city of China in December 2019, and afterward, it became a global pandemic spreading rapidly around the world. As the virus spreads through human to human contact, it has affected our lives in a devastating way, including the vigorous pressure on the public health system, the world economy, education sector, workplaces, and shopping malls. Preventing viral spreading requires early detection of positive cases and to treat infected patients as quickly as possible. The need for COVID-19 testing kits has increased, and many of the developing countries in the world are facing a shortage of testing kits as new cases are increasing day by day. In this situation, the recent research using radiology imaging (such as X-ray and CT scan) techniques can be proven helpful to detect COVID-19 as X-ray and CT scan images provide important information about the disease caused by COVID-19 virus. The latest data mining and machine learning techniques such as Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) can be applied along with X-ray and CT scan images of the lungs for the accurate and rapid detection of the disease, assisting in mitigating the problem of scarcity of testing kits. Methods: Hence a novel CNN model called CoroDet for automatic detection of COVID-19 by using raw chest X-ray and CT scan images have been proposed in this study. CoroDet is developed to serve as an accurate diagnostics for 2 class classification (COVID and Normal), 3 class classification (COVID, Normal, and non-COVID pneumonia), and 4 class classification (COVID, Normal, non-COVID viral pneumonia, and non-COVID bacterial pneumonia). Results: The performance of our proposed model was compared with ten existing techniques for COVID detection in terms of accuracy. A classification accuracy of 99.1% for 2 class classification, 94.2% for 3 class classification, and 91.2% for 4 class classification was produced by our proposed model, which is obviously better than the state-of-the-art-methods used for COVID-19 detection to the best of our knowledge. Moreover, the dataset with x-ray images that we prepared for the evaluation of our method is the largest datasets for COVID detection as far as our knowledge goes. Conclusion: The experimental results of our proposed method CoroDet indicate the superiority of CoroDet over the existing state-of-the-art-methods. CoroDet may assist clinicians in making appropriate decisions for COVID-19 detection and may also mitigate the problem of scarcity of testing kits.","Hussain, Emtiaz; Hasan, Mahmudul; Rahman, Md Anisur; Lee, Ickjai; Tamanna, Tasmi; Parvez, Mohammad Zavid",Chaos Solitons Fractals,770,20

The objective of this study was to summarize the adverse drug events (ADEs) associated with HCQ, CQ, and AZM use during the national COVID-19 emergency and compare the results with known adverse reactions listed in the drugs' package inserts. METHODS: A cross-sectional study design was used. The publicly available Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System quarterly data extract files from January 1, 2020 to June 30, 2020 were downloaded. A disproportionality analysis was conducted using the proportional reporting ratio to identify possible ADE signals. A Poisson regression was used to assess if the number of ADE reports for the 3 drugs increased over time. RESULTS: There was a statistically significant increasing trend in the reported ADEs for both HCQ (P < 0.001) and AZM (P < 0.001). Before the declaration of the national emergency, there were 592 reported drug-ADE pairs for the 3 drugs compared with 2492 drug-ADE pairs reported after March 13, 2020. These 2492 drug-ADE pairs represented 848 ADEs across the 3 drugs, of which 114 (13.4%) were identified as potential signals including 55 (48.2%) that were not listed in the prescribing information. CONCLUSIONS: Our results showed that the reported ADEs for HCQ and AZM have increased during the COVID-19 pandemic. Differences were observed in both the type of and frequency of the highest reported ADEs for the 3 selected drugs before and after the national emergency declaration. Although causation cannot be determined from ADE reports, further investigation of some reports may be warranted.

It is hypothesized that the severe acute respiratory syndrome corona virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has the potential to elicit autoimmunity due to molecular mimicry between human extracellular Hsps and immunogenic proteins of the virus. To confirm the above hypothesis, levels of circulating autoantibodies directed to the key human chaperones i.e., Hsp60, Hsp70, and Hsp90 in the anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG-seropositive participants have been evaluated. Twenty-six healthy volunteers who got two doses of the mRNA vaccine encoding the viral spike protein, anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG-positive participants (n = 15), and healthy naïve (anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG-negative) volunteers (n = 51) have been included in this study.

There is little research on individuals' COVID-19 vaccination decision-making. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to determine individual preferences for COVID-19 vaccinations in China, and to assess the factors influencing vaccination decision-making to facilitate vaccination coverage. METHODS: A D-efficient discrete choice experiment was conducted across six Chinese provinces selected by the stratified random sampling method. Vaccine choice sets were constructed using seven attributes: vaccine effectiveness, side-effects, accessibility, number of doses, vaccination sites, duration of vaccine protection, and proportion of acquaintances vaccinated. Conditional logit and latent class models were used to identify preferences. RESULTS: Although all seven attributes were proved to significantly influence respondents' vaccination decision, vaccine effectiveness, side-effects and proportion of acquaintances vaccinated were the most important. We also found a higher probability of vaccinating when the vaccine was more effective; risks of serious side effects were small; vaccinations were free and voluntary; the fewer the number of doses; the longer the protection duration; and the higher the proportion of acquaintances vaccinated. Higher local vaccine coverage created altruistic herd incentives to vaccinate rather than free-rider problems. The predicted vaccination uptake of the optimal vaccination scenario in our study was 84.77%. Preference heterogeneity was substantial. Individuals who were older, had a lower education level, lower income, higher trust in the vaccine and higher perceived risk of infection, displayed a higher probability to vaccinate. CONCLUSIONS: Preference heterogeneity among individuals should lead health authorities to address the diversity of expectations about COVID-19 vaccinations. To maximize COVID-19 vaccine uptake, health authorities should promote vaccine effectiveness; pro-actively communicate the absence or presence of vaccine side effects; and ensure rapid and wide media communication about local vaccine coverage.","Leng, Anli; Maitland, Elizabeth; Wang, Siyuan; Nicholas, Stephen; Liu, Rugang; Wang, Jian",Vaccine,770,20
265102,265102,265102,First six sequences of the complete SARS-CoV-2 genome by NGS in El Salvador,9.964763,9.988896,2021,"Coronaviruses may exert severely negative effects on the mortality and morbidity of birds and mammals including humans and domestic animals. Most recently CoVID-19 has killed about half million people (27th of June, 2020). Susceptibility to this disease appears to differ markedly across different societies but the factors underlying this variability are not known. Given that prevalence of toxoplasmosis in human societies may serve as a proxy for hygiene, and it also exerts both direct and immune-mediated antiviral effects, we hypothesize a negative covariation between toxoplasmosis and measures of the CoVID-19 pandemic across countries. We obtained aged-adjusted toxoplasmosis prevalence of pregnant women from the literature. Since the differences in the CoVID-19 morbidity and mortality may depend on the different timing of the epidemics in each country, we applied the date of first documented CoVID-19 in each country as a proxy of susceptibility, with a statistical control for population size effects. Using these two indices, we show a highly significant negative co-variation between the two pandemics across 86 countries. Then, considering that the wealth of nations often co-varies with the prevalence of diseases, we introduced GDP per capita into our model. The prevalence of toxoplasmosis co-varies negatively, while the date of first CoVID-19 co-varies positively with GDP per capita across countries. Further, to control for the strong spatial autocorrelation among countries, we carried out a Spatial Structure Analyses of the relationships between the date of first CoVID-19, prevalence of toxoplasmosis, and GDP per capita. Results of this analysis did not confirm a direct causal relationship between toxoplasmosis and susceptibility to the CoVID-19 pandemics. As far as an analysis of observational data let us to suggest, it appears that the interaction between CoVID-19 and toxoplasmosis is mediated by GDP per capita and spatial effects. This prompts the question whether the formerly known covariations of CoVID-19 and BCG vaccination or air pollution might have also emerged as spurious indirect effects.","Jankowiak, Lukasz; Rozsa, Lajos; Tryjanowski, Piotr; Møller, Anders Pape",Sci Rep,770,23

the Internet of Things and wearable technology in recent decades have brought great changes and convenience with better healthcare and manufacturing and higher safety, security, and efficiency for the whole society As an essential important link in these systems, sensors provide key value proposition and play a pivotal role Take wearable electronics as examples, the market value of wearable technology has doubled in the past five years Sensors have provided core functions for many different products during the development of wearable electronics, and they will continue to play a key role in future generation of products For example, smartwatches and skin patches are built based on the fitness tracking and daily activity data, and are used for medical measurement Virtual, augmented, and mixed reality devices rely on a set of sensors (e g inertial measurement unit, depth induction, force/pressure sensors) to enable users to interact with the content and environment Moreover, the transition from traditional human-computer interaction to a natural user interface will also depend on further advances in sensors Other products in different areas, such as autonomous vehicles, air detector, and smart clothing, are similar and depend on a set of core sensors that can interact with the body or the surrounding environment Some of these sensor systems have been gradually commercialized and expanded to more industrial, agricultural, military, environmental, and safety applications In particular, the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 has also brought increased attention to sensors owing to their promising applications in tracking early onset and potential virus contacts, and remote patient monitoring of isolated patients In short, the sensor remains a fundamental component of the entire product line, which has been required to be thinner, lighter, smaller, more flexible, and sensitive in the new application systems Based on the important role of sensors, many preparation methods such as vapor deposition, lithography, nano-imprint lithography as well as printing have been developed Each technology has its unique advantages and adapts to different scenarios At the same time, their disadvantages that cannot be ignored also need to be addressed For instance, chemical and physical vapor deposition methods, including thermal evaporation, vacuum evaporation, magnetron sputtering, and molecular beam epitaxy, can produce high-quality materials and devices with good performance, but these technologies usually require expensive equipment and specific operating environment Moreover, it is difficult for these techniques to be compatible with flexible substrates and realize low-cost industrialized mass production In addition, photolithography and nano-imprint lithography are suitable for precision device fabrication However, they often face the challenges of low processing efficiency, low output, high cost due to the complex processing process, high design cost of mask, and long processing cycle In comparison, printing is a very attractive technology for low-cost large scale production But in most cases, the presence of mask limits the precision and resolution of the prepared micro/nano-sized devices Therefore, with the increasing demand for flexible, wearable, miniaturized, precise, integrated, and customized sensors, the new processing method with higher precision and more flexibility manners is needed to achieve controllable preparation To meet the developmental requirements of sensors, various processing techniques mentioned above are utilized to optimize and improve the sensor mainly from the aspects of the electrode, sensing material, and whole device In recent decade, laser micro-nano fabrication has been gradually developed and popular in the field of manufacturing The laser micro-nano fabrication changes the material state and property through the laser-material interaction and realizes the well-control of shape and property across scales With the advantages of large proc ssing speed, high precision, strong controllability, easy integration, and high compatibility with materials, the sensor fabricated by laser has ushered in a new development in structure regulation and performance optimization However, it still faces challenges and difficulties in mass production and efficiency promotion in practical applications Progress The laser processing technologies for the fabrication of sensors and sensing systems of different stimulus sources are summarized (Fig 2) Firstly, three laser processing modes widely used in sensor production including laser induced heating, reaction, and delamination are introduced The convenience and advantages of laser processing compared with those of the traditional processing technology can be clearly understood in the section of laser processing modes (Fig 3) Then, based on the existing research results, the sensor systems prepared by laser are classified into ultraviolet, gas, humidity, temperature, strain/stress, biology, and environmental monitoring sensors It is easily found that the advantages of laser micro-nano fabrication are mainly reflected in the following three aspects 1) Laser micro-nano fabrication has broadened the preparation approaches of electrodes and sensing materials It can realize in-situ or non-in-situ preparation of conductive electrodes and sensing materials by laser reduction, sintering, annealing, ablation, pulse deposition, laser induced carbonization, and hydrothermal reaction as well as other specific laser processing technologies, which provide alternative strategies for material preparation 2) Laser micro-nano fabrication simplifies the assembly process of the whole device The laser direct writing technology can realize in situ selective process in specific areas or specific materials, leading to great convenience for device construction Moreover, the whole sensor on flexible substrates can even be prepared by one-step laser fabrication through digital design 3) Laser micro-nano fabrication contributes to promote sensor performance Sensing material, as a key part of a single sensor, can be modified and regulated by laser processing, thus providing the possibility of performance optimization With these optimizations and improvements, the sensors become softer, smaller, and more customized and have higher integration Finally, we also analyze the problems existing in sensors fabricated by laser micro-nano fabrication, such as insufficient researches on laser-material interaction, limited processing accuracy and efficiency enhancement, and low level of device integration Conclusions and Prospect Laser micro-nano fabrication has gradually become a common and popular technology for sensing system preparation and integration To sum up, the sensor fabricated by laser still needs in-depth and detailed exploration to promote the development of

Torsade de pointes typically occurs in bursts of self-limiting episodes with symptoms of dizziness and syncope. However, it may occasionally progress to ventricular fibrillation and sudden death. In this article, we report a case of COVID-19 patient who developed polymorphic ventricular tachycardia with torsade de pointes morphology with normal QTc interval in the setting of fever. An 81-year-old woman was admitted with symptoms of COVID-19. She was treated with hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, and doxycycline at an outside facility and finished the treatment 5 days prior to admission to our facility. Her course was complicated by atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response requiring cardioversion. Later, she developed two episodes of polymorphic ventricular tachycardia with TdP morphology with normal QTc. There was a correlation with fever triggering the ventricular tachycardia. We advocated aggressive fever control given the QTc was normal and stable. Following fever control, the patient remained stable and had no abnormal rhythm. COVID-19 patients are prone to different arrhythmias including life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias with normal left ventricular systolic function and normal QTc, and they should be monitored for fever and electrolyte abnormality during their hospital stay.","Babapoor-Farrokhran, Savalan; Port, Zachary; Wiener, Philip C; Amanullah, Aman; Mainigi, Sumeet K",SN Compr Clin Med,770,1

It has been recently proposed that COVID-19 is an endothelial disease. Indeed, the COVID-19 virus binds to angiotensin-converting enzyme type 2 (ACE2), which is expressed in endothelial cells. ACE2 could be implicated in the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) caused by endothelial dysfunction due to viral damage. Consequently, oxidative stress could prime these cells to acquire a pro-thrombotic and pro-inflammatory phenotype, predisposing patients to thromboembolic and vasculitic events and to disseminated intravascular coagulopathy (DIC). This implies a pivotal role played by oxygen in the pathogenetic mechanism of COVID-19 disease, in that its availability would tune the oxidant state and consequent damage.","Panfoli, Isabella",Clin Med (Lond),770,24

METHODS: The tool was based on a Susceptible-Infected-Removed (SIR) epidemiological model in which the population is divided into three compartments and transmission parameters are specified to define the rate at which people move between stages. Appropriate data entry was guaranteed by the creation of structured guided paths. The drugs needed for the forecasted patients were estimated according to a list of critical care drugs compiled by consulting previous published scientific works, national and international guidelines. For each drug, an estimation was made of the percentage average ICU uptake for each therapeutic group and active principle. RESULTS: The tool consists of a Microsoft Excel template that is based on the initial epidemiological situation, the non-pharmaceutical interventions applied, the risk of hospitalisation based on the population age distribution, and the hospital beds available. The tool provides a forecast of which patients with COVID-19 will need to be treated in a hospital setting. The number of patients is used to estimate the drugs needed based on the average daily dose and the treatment length of each drug. The possibility of editing the type of distribution (exponential or linear) of the number of patients at the beginning of the analysis, the percentage adherence with non-pharmaceutical interventions and their delayed effect, and all the key epidemiological parameters make the estimation tailorable to different clinical contexts and needs. CONCLUSIONS: This model might be an effective supporting tool that could be easily implemented within the workflow of health professionals.

We prospectively screened at-risk individuals for SARS-CoV-2 spike and nucleocapsid protein antibodies in a POC setting to determine if it was a feasible method to identify antibody from prior infection. METHODS: Three EUA-approved lateral flow antibody assays were performed on POC finger-stick blood and compared with serum and a CLIA nucleocapsid antibody immunoassay. Variables including antibody class, time since PCR, and the assay antigen used were evaluated. RESULTS: 512 subjects enrolled, of which 104 had a COVID-19 history and positive PCR. Only three PCR-positive subjects required hospitalization, with one requiring mechanical ventilation. The POC results correlated well with the immunoassay (93-97% sensitivity) and using serum did not improve the sensitivity or specificity. CONCLUSIONS: Finger-stick, POC COVID-19 antibody testing was highly effective in identifying antibody resulting from prior infections in mildly symptomatic subjects. Using high-complexity serum immunoassays did not improve the screening outcome. Almost all individuals with COVID-19 infection produced detectable antibodies to the virus.

The S1 sequences were divisible into four groups: A to D. All Yamagata strains belonged to either group B or group D. In group B, 46 (90.2%) out of 51 Yamagata strains were clustered with those of genotype E reference strains (cluster E). In group D, 28 (17.8%) and 122 (77.7%) out of 157 Yamagata strains were clustered, respectively, with genotype F and genotype G reference strains. In cluster G, 28 strains formed a distinct cluster.

Objective: To evaluate the association of public health interventions with the epidemiological features of the COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan by 5 periods according to key events and interventions. Design, Setting, and Participants: In this cohort study, individual-level data on 32â¯583 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases reported between December 8, 2019, and March 8, 2020, were extracted from the municipal Notifiable Disease Report System, including patients' age, sex, residential location, occupation, and severity classification. Exposures: Nonpharmaceutical public health interventions including cordons sanitaire, traffic restriction, social distancing, home confinement, centralized quarantine, and universal symptom survey. Main Outcomes and Measures: Rates of laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 infections (defined as the number of cases per day per million people), across age, sex, and geographic locations were calculated across 5 periods: December 8 to January 9 (no intervention), January 10 to 22 (massive human movement due to the Chinese New Year holiday), January 23 to February 1 (cordons sanitaire, traffic restriction and home quarantine), February 2 to 16 (centralized quarantine and treatment), and February 17 to March 8 (universal symptom survey). The effective reproduction number of SARS-CoV-2 (an indicator of secondary transmission) was also calculated over the periods. Results: Among 32 583 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases, the median patient age was 56.7 years (range, 0-103; interquartile range, 43.4-66.8) and 16 817 (51.6%) were women. The daily confirmed case rate peaked in the third period and declined afterward across geographic regions and sex and age groups, except for children and adolescents, whose rate of confirmed cases continued to increase. The daily confirmed case rate over the whole period in local health care workers (130.5 per million people [95% CI, 123.9-137.2]) was higher than that in the general population (41.5 per million people [95% CI, 41.0-41.9]). The proportion of severe and critical cases decreased from 53.1% to 10.3% over the 5 periods. The severity risk increased with age: compared with those aged 20 to 39 years (proportion of severe and critical cases, 12.1%), elderly people (&#8805;80 years) had a higher risk of having severe or critical disease (proportion, 41.3%; risk ratio, 3.61 [95% CI, 3.31-3.95]) while younger people (<20 years) had a lower risk (proportion, 4.1%; risk ratio, 0.47 [95% CI, 0.31-0.70]). The effective reproduction number fluctuated above 3.0 before January 26, decreased to below 1.0 after February 6, and decreased further to less than 0.3 after March 1. Conclusions and Relevance: A series of multifaceted public health interventions was temporally associated with improved control of the COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan, China.

In this study, we have developed and evaluated a novel one-step single-tube nested quantitative real-time PCR (OSN-qRT-PCR) assay for the highly sensitive detection of SARS-CoV-2 targeting the ORF1ab and N genes. The sensitivity of the OSN-qRT-PCR assay was 1 copy/reaction and 10-fold higher than that of the commercial qRT-PCR kit (10 copies/reaction). The clinical performance of the OSN-qRT-PCR assay was evaluated using 181 clinical samples. Among them, 14 qRT-PCR-negative samples (7 had no repetitive results and 7 had no cycle threshold (CT) values) were detected by OSN-qRT-PCR. Moreover, the 7 qRT-PCR-positives in the qRT-PCR gray zone (CT values of ORF1ab ranged from 37.48 to 39.07, and CT values of N ranged from 37.34 to 38.75) were out of the gray zone and thus were deemed to be positive by OSN-qRT-PCR, indicating that the positivity of these samples is confirmative.

As universities prepare to re-start in-class activities, students' adherence to physical distancing requirements is a priority topic. While physical distancing in classrooms can be easily managed, the movement of students inside common spaces can pose higher risks due to individuals' proximity. This paper provides an experimental analysis of unidirectional student flow inside a case-study university building, by investigating students' movements and grouping behaviour according to physical distancing requirements. Results show general adherence with the minimum required physical distancing guidance, but some spaces, such as corridors, pose higher exposure than doorways. Their width, in combination with group behaviour, affects the students' capacity to keep the recommended distance. Furthermore, students report higher perceived vulnerability while moving along corridors. Evidence-based results can support decision-makers in understanding individuals' exposure in universities and researchers in developing behavioural models in preparation of future outbreaks and pandemics.","Bartolucci, Andrea; Templeton, Anne; Bernardini, Gabriele",,770,23

STUDY DESIGN: This is an observational study wherein public health surveillance systems are evaluated. METHODS: Data were collected in the Public Health England's Second-Generation Surveillance System through routine laboratory reporting processes, as well as via enhanced testing in collaboration with commercial partners. Three periods were chosen to present developments in disease surveillance around the first pandemic wave in England. Completeness of valid entries for key demographic and epidemiological fields was summarised. Timeliness was assessed using recorded date intervals: from sample collection to the laboratory reporting a positive result, the positive result being received by the national surveillance system and the data being available for epidemiological analysis. RESULTS: In each period, demographic variables were more than 95% complete and enhanced ethnicity more than 85%, allowing a rich understanding of the general characteristics of COVID-19 cases in England. The proportion of cases completing all reporting stages of the national system within 3 days of when the specimen was taken increased from 69.1% in period 1 to 76.6% in period 3. In period 3, the median number of days to complete all reporting stages decreased to 2, from 3 in previous periods. Analysis of each reporting stage offers suggestive evidence that timeliness of the system has improved as reporting has become established over time. CONCLUSIONS: Timely processing of data for epidemiological use was consistent and rapid once received by the national system. Delays in timeliness were most likely to occur in the first stage of the reporting process, before laboratory input to the surveillance platform. Existing national surveillance mechanisms enhanced during the response have succeeded in providing rapid collection and reporting of case data to facilitate epidemiological monitoring and analysis and guide public health policy and strategy.","Clare, T; Twohig, K A; O039,; Connell, A-M; Dabrera, G",Public Health,770,16

Pain is the first reported symptom, related to insufficient oxygen delivery to the extremities that leads to ischemia of the peripheral tissues. The initial treatment is conservative, but if the symptoms persist, necrosis and distal amputation can occur. In selected patients, neuromodulation with spinal cord stimulation (SCS) can be an effective treatment by reducing pain and amputation rate. Recent evidence suggests that severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) can cause endotheliopathy with microvascular and macrovascular thrombotic events and can present as a systemic inflammatory vascular disease. We present a case of a severe necrotizing Raynaud's phenomenon successfully treated and controlled with SCS that abruptly reappeared during SARS-CoV-2 infection. The report of this case is suggestive for potential treatment in case of peripheral ischemia consequent to COVID-19 vasculopathy. The interaction between SCS and SARS-CoV-2-related endotheliopathy is unknown and would deserve further studies.","Giglio, M.; Preziosa, A.; Rekatsina, M.; Viswanath, O.; Urits, I.; Varrassi, G.; Paladini, A.; Puntillo, F.",Cureus,770,16

Myocarditis lacks systematic characterization in COVID-19 patients. Methods. We enrolled consecutive patients with newly diagnosed myocarditis in the context of COVID-19 infection. Diagnostic and treatment strategies were driven by a dedicated multidisciplinary disease unit for myocarditis. Multimodal outcomes were assessed during prospective follow-up. Results. Seven consecutive patients (57% males, age 51 ± 9 y) with acute COVID-19 infection received a de novo diagnosis of myocarditis. Endomyocardial biopsy was of choice in hemodynamically unstable patients (n = 4, mean left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) 25 ± 9%), whereas cardiac magnetic resonance constituted the first exam in stable patients (n = 3, mean LVEF 48 ± 10%). Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis revealed an intra-myocardial SARS-CoV-2 genome in one of the six cases undergoing biopsy: in the remaining patients, myocarditis was either due to other viruses (n = 2) or virus-negative (n = 3). Hemodynamic support was needed for four unstable patients (57%), whereas a cardiac device implant was chosen in two of four cases showing ventricular arrhythmias. Medical treatment included immunosuppression (43%) and biological therapy (29%). By the 6-month median follow-up, no patient died or experienced malignant arrhythmias. However, two cases (29%) were screened for heart transplantation. Conclusions. Myocarditis associated with acute COVID-19 infection is a spectrum of clinical manifestations and underlying etiologies. A multidisciplinary approach is the cornerstone for tailored management.","Peretto, Giovanni Villatore Andrea Rizzo Stefania Esposito Antonio De Luca Giacomo Palmisano Anna Vignale Davide Cappelletti Alberto Maria Tresoldi Moreno Campochiaro Corrado Sartorelli Silvia Ripa Marco De Gaspari Monica Busnardo Elena Ferro Paola Calabrò Maria Grazia Fominskiy Evgeny Monaco Fabrizio Cavalli Giulio Gianolli Luigi De Cobelli Francesco Margonato Alberto Dagna Lorenzo Scandroglio Mara Camici Paolo Guido Mazzone Patrizio Della Bella Paolo Basso Cristina Sala Simone",Journal of Clinical Medicine,770,20

Il n’existe pas à ce jour de moyen efficace pour s’assurer du bon suivi des recommandations vaccinales chez les personnes à risques. Pour améliorer la couverture vaccinale des patients hospitalisés, nous avons mis en place un processus interprofessionnel et novateur : la conciliation vaccinale (CV). Matériels et méthodes Nous avons conduit une étude prospective unicentrique dans un service des maladies infectieuses d’un CHU de France sur une période d’un an. Les intervenants ont été : étudiants en pharmacie (analyse & suivi) et en médecine (recueil), infirmières (acte vaccinal), internes en médecine (recueil & prescription), pharmaciens (analyse), médecins (analyse & suivi & prescription). Tous les patients hospitalisés en maladies infectieuses en 2020 et acceptant le recueil de leurs données relatives aux vaccinations (sous toutes formes : DTPCa, pneumocoque, grippe saisonnière, VHB, ROR, VZV, méningocoque, VHA) ont été inclus (n=665). Si une ou plusieurs des vaccinations du patient n’étai(en)t pas à jour, celui-ci se voyait proposer un rattrapage (fait durant son hospitalisation ou prescrit à sa sortie). Résultats Sur 665 patients inclus, 49 % (326) ont bénéficié de la CV. L’absence de CV a pour causes: des patients restant en moyenne moins longtemps (p&lt;0,00000001) et une charge de travail ajoutée par la gestion de l’épidémie de COVID-19. Parmi les patients ayant eu une CV, 20 % (64) ont pu fournir des informations sur la totalité des vaccinations considérées. Ceux-ci étaient en moyenne plus âgés (p=0,024). Parmi les patients ayant eu une CV, 25 % (81) étaient à jour de toutes leurs vaccinations. Les patients bénéficiant d’une CV étaient en moyenne hospitalisés plus longtemps (p=0,0016) mais ni le sexe ni l’âge n’ont été des facteurs favorisant la réalisation d’une CV (p respectifs : 0,554 et 0,455). Les patients à jour n’étaient en moyenne pas différents de la population totale en sexe, âge et durée d’hospitalisation (p respectifs : 0,084 et 0,327 et 0,205). Parmi les patients ayant eu une CV, les taux de patients à jour ou pour lesquels il n’y a pas d’indication à la vaccination ont été de près de 40 % pour le DTPCa et le pneumocoque, 60 % pour la grippe et le VHB et 80 % pour les autres, recoupant les données de la littérature. Notre action a conduit à une hausse significative du nombre de patients vaccinés et donc de la couverture vaccinale : très forte (+350 %, p&lt;0,00001) pour le DTPCa et pneumocoque ;et plus faible mais significative (+6 à +60 %, p&lt;0,0001) pour tous les autres vaccins. Conclusion Nous avons réussi à mettre en place un processus de CV au sein d’un service de maladies infectieuses. Nous avons pu montrer que notre processus améliore à faible coût la couverture vaccinale pour plusieurs vaccins chez les patients hospitalisés dans notre service en 2020. Nous pouvons diviser les vaccinations étudiées en 3 classes, selon le bénéfice attendu de la CV : – DTPCa & pneumocoque : très élevé ;– grippe & VHB : élevé ;– autres vaccins étudiés : limité.

Although the greater focus on social determinants is laudable and necessary, there is a tendency for health care organizations to implement SDOH programs at scale without rigorous evidence of effect, rather than targeting interventions to specific patients and assessing their impact. This broad, and sometimes blind, application of SDOH interventions can be costly and wasteful. We argue for rejecting the ""more is better"" mindset and specifically targeting patients who truly need and would substantially benefit from SDOH interventions.

Although the recommendation is to use automated methods for nucleic acid extraction, alternatives are necessary to replace commercial kits. However, these alternatives should be as reliable as automated methods. This work describes a simple method to detect SARS-CoV-2 from specimens collected in different preservation media. Samples were previously inactivated by heating and precipitating with a PEG/NaCl solution before rRT-PCR assays for Orf1ab, N and S genes. The new method was compared with an automated protocol of nucleic acid extraction. Both procedures showed similar analytical results.

We implemented an innovative teaching proposal based on high-fidelity virtual OSCEs with standardized patients. The purposes of our study were to describe this innovative teaching proposal and compare nursing competence acquisition in final year nursing students through virtual and in-person OSCE modalities. The study included 234 undergraduate students: 123 students were assessed through high-fidelity virtual OSCEs during May 2020, whereas 111 students were assessed through in-person OSCEs during May 2019. The structure of OSCEs, including its stations, clinical simulated scenarios, and checklists, was the same in both OSCE modalities. The effect size of the differences among the competence categories of checklists, including their total scores, was small. Regarding our virtual OSCEs was similarly successful to in-person OSCEs, this online format was found to be useful, feasible, and cost-saving when in-person OSCE was not possible. Therefore, high-fidelity virtual OSCEs with standardized patients could be considered as another choice of OSCE not only in the current COVID-19 pandemic but could also be extended to normal situations, even post-pandemic.","Arrogante, Oscar; López-Torre, Eva María; Carrión-García, Laura; Polo, Alberto; Jiménez-Rodríguez, Diana",,770,22

Anosmia and agueusia are now well documented and included in the criteria list for diagnosis, and specialists have stressed that doctors screen COVID-19 patients for these two signs. The eventual brainstem dysregulation, due to the invasion of SARS CoV-2, as a cause of respiratory problems linked to COVID-19, has also been extensively discussed. All these findings lead to an implication of the central nervous system in the pathophysiology of COVID-19. Here we provide additional elements that could explain other described signs like appetite loss, vomiting, and nausea. For this, we investigated the role of brainstem structures located in the medulla oblongata involved in food intake and vomiting control. We also discussed the possible pathways the virus uses to reach the brainstem, i.e., neurotropic and hematogenous (with its two variants) routes.","Chigr, Fatiha; Merzouki, Mohamed; Najimi, Mohamed",ACS Chem Neurosci,770,1

OBJECTIVE: To identify priorities, and criteria that health services can use to pursue actually the goal of achieving person-centred care. DESIGN: Three-phase online qualitative study performed during May-July of 2020 using the Delphi technique. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: An online platform was used for a consensus meeting of 114 participants, including health planning experts, health-care institution managers, clinicians and patients. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Criteria and indicators for the achievement of person-centred care. MAIN RESULTS: The first round began with 125 proposals and 11 dimensions. After the second round, 28 ideas reached a high level of consensus among the participants. Ultimately, the workgroup agreed on 20 criteria for goals in the implementation of person-centred care during the COVID-19 era and 21 related indicators to measure goal achievement. DISCUSSION: Nine dimensions and 28 priorities were identified. These priorities are also in accordance with the quadruple aim approach, which emphasizes the need for care for health-care professionals, without whom it is impossible to achieve a better quality of care. CONCLUSIONS: Person-centred care continues to be a key objective. However, new metrics are needed to ensure its continued development during the restoration of public health services beyond the control of COVID-19.

Risks and characteristics relating to secondary infections in severe COVID-19 have not been described. Methods Severe and critical COVID-19 patients from Shanghai were included. We collected lower respiratory, urine, catheters, and blood samples according to clinical necessity and culture and mNGS were performed. Clinical and laboratory data were archived. Results We found 57.89% (22/38) patients developed secondary infections. The patient receiving invasive mechanical ventilation or in critical state has a higher chance of secondary infections (P<0.0001). The most common infections were respiratory, blood-stream and urinary infections, and in respiratory infections, the most detected pathogens were gram-negative bacteria (26, 50.00%), following by gram-positive bacteria (14, 26.92%), virus (6, 11.54%), fungi (4, 7.69%), and others (2, 3.85%). Respiratory Infection rate post high flow, tracheal intubation, and tracheotomy were 12.90% (4/31), 30.43% (7/23), and 92.31% (12/13) respectively. Secondary infections would lead to lower discharge rate and higher mortality rate. Conclusion Our study originally illustrated secondary infection proportion in severe and critical COVID-19 patients. Culture accompanied with metagenomics sequencing increased pathogen diagnostic rate. Secondary infections risks increased after receiving invasive respiratory ventilations and intravascular devices, and would lead to a lower discharge rate and a higher mortality rate.","Zhang, Haocheng; Zhang, Yi; Wu, Jing; Li, Yang; Zhou, Xian; Li, Xin; Chen, Haili; Guo, Mingquan; Chen, Shu; Sun, Feng; Mao, Richeng; Qiu, Chao; Zhu, Zhaoqin; Ai, Jingwen; Zhang, Wenhong",Emerg Microbes Infect,770,26

This study aimed at exploring vascular comorbidity patterns among SARS-CoV-2 infected patients with subsequent stroke. We also investigated whether the comorbidities and their frequencies under each subclass of TOAST criteria were similar to the AIS population studies prior to the pandemic. METHODS: This is a report from the Multinational COVID-19 Stroke Study Group. We present an original dataset of SASR-CoV-2 infected patients who had a subsequent stroke recorded through our multicenter prospective study. In addition, we built a dataset of previously reported patients by conducting a systematic literature review. We demonstrated distinct subgroups by clinical risk scoring models and unsupervised machine learning algorithms, including hierarchical K-Means (ML-K) and Spectral clustering (ML-S). RESULTS: This study included 323 AIS patients from 71 centers in 17 countries from the original dataset and 145 patients reported in the literature. The unsupervised clustering methods suggest a distinct cohort of patients (ML-K: 36% and ML-S: 42%) with no or few comorbidities. These patients were more than 6 years younger than other subgroups and more likely were men (ML-K: 59% and ML-S: 60%). The majority of patients in this subgroup suffered from an embolic-appearing stroke on imaging (ML-K: 83% and ML-S: 85%) and had about 50% risk of large vessel occlusions (ML-K: 50% and ML-S: 53%). In addition, there were two cohorts of patients with large-artery atherosclerosis (ML-K: 30% and ML-S: 43% of patients) and cardioembolic strokes (ML-K: 34% and ML-S: 15%) with consistent comorbidity and imaging patterns.

In this crisis time of the COVID-19 outbreak, technologists try to smooth the lives by minimizing the infection rate and facilitating in-time quality treatment. In this work, we collected the world data of COVID-19 cases in terms of confirmed, recovery, active, and death and provided visualization. We have also tried to find the patient’s risk level in terms of high, medium, and low by analyzing the patient’s symptoms and previous health histories such as high blood pressure, cardiac disease, diabetes, kidney issues, and others.

Phages from this group conduct a strictly lytic lifestyle and cause substantial losses during milk fermentation processes, by infecting lactococcal host starter strains. Despite their deleterious activity, there are limited research data concerning Ceduovirus phages. To advance our knowledge on this specific phage group, we sequenced and performed a comparative analysis of 10 new Lactococcus lactis Ceduovirus phages isolated from distinct dairy environments. Host range studies allowed us to distinguish the differential patterns of infection of L. lactis cells for each phage, and revealed a broad host spectrum for most of them. We showed that 40% of the studied Ceduovirus phages can infect both cremoris and lactis strains. A preference to lyse strains with the C-type cell wall polysaccharide genotype was observed. Phage whole-genome sequencing revealed an average nucleotide identity above 80%, with distinct regions of divergence mapped to several locations. The comparative approach for analyzing genomic data and the phage lytic spectrum suggested that the amino acid sequence of the orf8-encoded putative tape measure protein correlates with host range. Phylogenetic studies revealed separation of the sequenced phages into two subgroups. Finally, we identified three types of phage origin of replication regions, and showed they are able to support plasmid replication without additional phage proteins.","Chmielewska-Jeznach, Magdalena; Bardowski, Jacek K; Szczepankowska, Agnieszka K",Viruses,770,1

When do irrational fears of contamination as seen in OCD start to diverge from rational fears and behaviors? The current paper argues that the personal meaning attributed to viruses and germs, including their personification as entities that possess human-like characteristics, allows them to threaten and violate an individual's identity. Specifically, it suggests that fears of contamination become obsessional when the threat of viruses and germs becomes personal, not solely in terms of its objective outcomes, but in how these life forms are able to threaten the self as the result of a fear of inner corruption characterizing those with OCD. The person with OCD may act as if, or believe that they are acting upon reality when they fear contagion, but are in effect only acting upon an underlying fear of inner corruption that is confused with reality itself. The current paper concludes with some clinical recommendations on how to treat obsessional fears of contamination in the context of the current pandemic.","Aardema, Frederick",J.

The aim of this study was to find out the radiograph rejection and its causes during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemics as there was fear of coronavirus disease infection among the technical staff from the incoming patients in a busy, high volume public sector tertiary care hospital. Materials and method: This descriptive study was conducted at Radiology Department, Lady Reading Hospital, Peshawar from August to November, 2020. The rejected radiographs and their causes were analyzed. Results: A total of 15,000 X-ray procedures were conducted during study period out of which 2550 cases were repeated making the total rejection 17%. Rejection in male and female were 74.3 and 25.7%, respectively, while rejection in adults was (80.1%) and (19.9%) in pediatric age group of the total rejection. The main cause of rejection was positioning (30.5%) followed by artifacts (22.4%), motion (12.1%), improper collimation (10%), wrong labeling (8.4%), exposure errors (6.9%), detector errors (3.7%), machine faults (2.8%), re-request from referring physician (1.7%), and PACS issues (1.5%).

Classes included in the study were scheduled as full-semester, on-campus classes but made an emergency switch to online post-spring break, after eight weeks. Results: Students' and faculty's comfort levels at the time of the switch depended on the amount of prior experience they had in online teaching and learning. Individual students and faculty experienced varying degrees of ease of adjustment to the switch in format from in-class to online. Faculty had to adapt quickly to determine the best way to replicate the in-class experience. Many faculty would depend on familiarity with technology and creativity with its usage. To varying degrees, comfort level improved as the semester progressed for both faculty and students. Still, a majority of students expressed less interest than before in taking online classes.

Thus, predicting biological function from pathogen sequence is crucial and urgently needed. However, little work has been performed to identify viruses by the enzymes that they encode, and which are key to pathogen propagation. RESULTS: We built a comprehensive scientific resource, SARS2020, that integrates coronavirus-related research, genomic sequences, and results of anti-viral drug trials. In addition, we built a consensus sequence-catalytic function model from which we identified the novel coronavirus as encoding the same proteinase as the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome virus.

Smoking increases the risk of respiratory infections; thus, cessation represents a huge opportunity for public health. However, there is scarce evidence about if and how smoking affects the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection. METHODS: We performed an observational case-control study, assessing the single-day point prevalence of smoking among 218 COVID-19 adult patients hospitalized in 7 Italian non-intensive care wards and in a control group of 243 patients admitted for other conditions to 7 general wards COVID-19-free. We compared proportions for categorical variables by using the &#967;2 test and performed univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses to identify the variables associated with risk of hospitalization for COVID-19. RESULTS: The percentages of current smokers (4.1% vs 16%, p=0.00003) and never smokers (71.6% vs 56.8%, p=0.0014) were significantly different between COVID-19 and non-COVID 19 patients. COVID-19 patients had lower mean age (69.5 vs 74.2 years, p=0.00085) and were more frequently males (59.2% vs 44%, p=0.0011). In the logistic regression analysis, current smokers were significantly less likely to be hospitalized for COVID-19 compared with non-smokers (Odds ratio 0.23; 95% CI, 0.11-0.48, p<0.001), even after adjusting for age and gender (OR 0.14; 95% CI, 0.06-0.31, p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: We reported an unexpectedly low prevalence of current smokers among COVID-19 patients hospitalized in non-intensive care wards. The meaning of these preliminary findings, which are in line with those currently emerging in literature, is unclear; they need to be confirmed by larger studies. IMPLICATIONS: An unexpectedly low prevalence of current smokers among patients hospitalized for COVID-19 in some Italian non-intensive care wards is reported. This finding could be a stimulus for the generation of novel hypotheses on individual predisposition and possible strategies for reducing the risk of infection from SARS-CoV-2, and needs to be confirmed by further larger studies designed with adequate methodology.","Meini, Simone; Fortini, Alberto; Andreini, Roberto; Sechi, Leonardo Alberto; Tascini, Carlo",Nicotine tob. res,770,26

Over the subsequent 5 months, NPI policies were eased in stages according to a national strategy. COVID-19 spread throughout the country heterogeneously; the disease reached rural areas by July and case numbers peaked from July to August. A second COVID-19 wave began in late 2020. Data on the impact of NPI policies on social and economic well-being and access to health care are limited. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to determine how rural residents in three South African provinces changed their behaviors during the first COVID-19 epidemic wave. METHODS: The South African Population Research Infrastructure Network nodes in the Mpumalanga (Agincourt), KwaZulu-Natal, (Africa Health Research Institute) and Limpopo (Dikgale-Mamabolo-Mothiba) provinces conducted up to 14 rounds of longitudinal telephone surveys among randomly sampled households from rural and periurban surveillance populations every 2-3 weeks. Interviews included questions on the following topics: COVID-19-related knowledge and behaviors, the health and economic impacts of NPIs, and mental health. We analyzed how responses varied based on NPI stringency and household sociodemographics. RESULTS: In total, 5120 households completed 23,095 interviews between April and December 2020. Respondents' self-reported satisfaction with their COVID-19-related knowledge and face mask use rapidly rose to 85% and 95%, respectively, by August. As selected NPIs were eased, the amount of travel increased, economic losses were reduced, and the prevalence of anxiety and depression symptoms fell. When the number of COVID-19 cases spiked at one node in July, the amount of travel dropped rapidly and the rate of missed daily medications doubled. Households where more adults received government-funded old-age pensions reported concerns about economic matters and medication access less often. CONCLUSIONS: South Africans complied with stringent, COVID-19-related NPIs despite the threat of substantial social, economic, and health repercussions. Government-supported social welfare programs appeared to buffer interruptions in income and health care access during local outbreaks. Epidemic control policies must be balanced against the broader well-being of people in resource-limited settings and designed with parallel support systems when such policies threaten peoples' income and access to basic services.","Harling, Guy; Gómez-Olivé, Francesc Xavier; Tlouyamma, Joseph; Mutevedzi, Tinofa; Kabudula, Chodziwadziwa Whiteson; Mahlako, Ruth; Singh, Urisha; Ohene-Kwofie, Daniel; Buckland, Rose; Ndagurwa, Pedzisai; Gareta, Dickman; Gunda, Resign; Mngomezulu, Thobeka; Nxumalo, Siyabonga; Wong, Emily B; Kahn, Kathleen; Siedner, Mark J; Maimela, Eric; Tollman, Stephen; Collinson, Mark; Herbst, Kobus",JMIR Public Health Surveill,770,24

These unprecedented circumstances have amplified the sources of emotional distress and worker burnout. However, many healthcare organizations (HCOs) in the United States, have opted for a ""stoic approach"" to healthcare worker support, i.e., no additional support beyond federal and state policy protections for the licensing and liability of healthcare workers. In this scenario, a key public health concern is sustaining an adequate healthcare workforce, both by way of quantity (adequate numbers) and quality (maximizing clinician resilience to provide safe care to large volumes of patients under challenging conditions). Therefore, it is imperative for HCO leaders to recognize that a limited view of worker psychological safety, without due consideration for the broader emotional distress created by the pandemic, could have the effect of restricting organizational resilience and adversely impacting patient safety and staff retention during and beyond the pandemic. This paper uses the organizational resilience framework to discuss the potential impact of a stoic approach to healthcare worker support on patient safety and staff retention in a hospital intensive care unit (ICU) during COVID-19. The discussion in turn, helps to develop recommendations for HCOs to overcome these challenges.","Rangachari, Pavani; L Woods, Jacquelynn",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),770,1

All consecutive patients with symptoms were included in the analysis, RESULTS: Between March 1st and June 27th2020, data from 243 adult symptomatic cases from 36 centers and 9 countries were collected. Thirty-nine (16%) were managed as outpatients while 204 (84%) required hospitalization including admission to the ICU (39/204, 19.1%). Forty-nine (20.2%) patients died after a median of 13.5 (10-23) days, respiratory failure was the major cause. After multivariable Cox regression analysis, age > 70 (HR 4.16; 95%CI 1.78-9.73) had a negative effect and tacrolimus (TAC) use (HR 0.55; 95%CI 0.31-0.99) had a positive independent effect on survival. The role of co-morbidities was strongly influenced by the dominant effect of age where comorbidities increased with the increasing age of the recipients.

However, whether those changes are specific to SARS-CoV-2 or driven by a general inflammatory response shared across severely ill pneumonia patients remains unknown. Here, we compared the immune profile of severe COVID-19 with non-SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia ICU patients using longitudinal, high-dimensional single-cell spectral cytometry and algorithm-guided analysis. COVID-19 and non-SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia both showed increased emergency myelopoiesis and displayed features of adaptive immune paralysis. However, pathological immune signatures suggestive of T cell exhaustion were exclusive to COVID-19. The integration of single-cell profiling with a predicted binding capacity of SARS-CoV-2 peptides to the patients' HLA profile further linked the COVID-19 immunopathology to impaired virus recognition. Toward clinical translation, circulating NKT cell frequency was identified as a predictive biomarker for patient outcome. Our comparative immune map serves to delineate treatment strategies to interfere with the immunopathologic cascade exclusive to severe COVID-19.","Kreutmair, Stefanie; Unger, Susanne; Núñez, Nicolás Gonzalo; Ingelfinger, Florian; Alberti, Chiara; De Feo, Donatella; Krishnarajah, Sinduya; Kauffmann, Manuel; Friebel, Ekaterina; Babaei, Sepideh; Gaborit, Benjamin; Lutz, Mirjam; Jurado, Nicole Puertas; Malek, Nisar P; Goepel, Siri; Rosenberger, Peter; Häberle, Helene A; Ayoub, Ikram; Al-Hajj, Sally; Nilsson, Jakob; Claassen, Manfred; Liblau, Roland; Martin-Blondel, Guillaume; Bitzer, Michael; Roquilly, Antoine; Becher, Burkhard",Immunity,770,1

In order to effectively prepare a localized plan for infectious disease management, it is important to find the relationship between COVID-19 infection rate and other key variables. This study aims to understand the spatial relationships between COVID-19 infection rate and key variables of air pollution, geo-meteorological, and social parameters in Dhaka, Bangladesh. The relationship was analyzed using Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR) model and Geographic Information System (GIS) by means of COVID-19 infection rate as a dependent variable and 17 independent variables. This study revealed that air pollution parameters like PM2.5 (p < 0.02), AOT (p < 0.01), CO (p < 0.05), water vapor (p < 0.01), and O3 (p < 0.01) were highly correlated with COVID-19 infection rate while geo-meteorological parameters like DEM (p < 0.01), wind pressure (p < 0.01), LST (p < 0.04), rainfall (p < 0.01), and wind speed (p < 0.03) were also similarly associated. Social parameters like population density (p < 0.01), brickfield density (p < 0.02), and poverty level (p < 0.01) showed high coefficients as the key independent variables to COVID-19 infection rate. Significant robust relationships between these factors were found in the middle and southern parts of the city where the reported COVID-19 infection case was also higher. Relevant agencies can utilize these findings to formulate new and smart strategies for reducing infectious diseases like COVID-19 in Dhaka and in similar urban cities around the world. Future studies will have more variables including ecological, meteorological, and economical to model and understand the spread of COVID-19.","Hassan, Md Shareful; Bhuiyan, Mohammad Amir Hossain; Tareq, Faysal; Bodrud-Doza, Md; Tanu, Saikat Mandal; Rabbani, Khondkar Ayaz",Environ Monit Assess,770,20

Five online databases-Embase, PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, ScienceDirect and pre-print Medrevix were searched. The inclusion criteria were observational studies measuring serum vitamin D in adult and elderly subjects with COVID-19. The main outcome was the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency in severe cases of COVID-19. We carried out a meta-analysis with random effect measures. We identified 1542 articles and selected 27. Vitamin D deficiency was not associated with a higher chance of infection by COVID-19 (OR = 1.35; 95% CI = 0.80-1.88), but we identified that severe cases of COVID-19 present 64% (OR = 1.64; 95% CI = 1.30-2.09) more vitamin D deficiency compared with mild cases.

Of these deaths, acute coronary syndromes (ACS) account for a substantial percentage of deaths. Improvement in ACS outcomes, are achieved by reducing the time from symptom onset until reperfusion or total ischemic time (TIT). Nevertheless, due to the overwhelming reality at the beginning of the pandemic, acute coronary syndrome (ACS) care may have been compromised. OBJECTIVES: We evaluated delays in TIT based on the date and timing of admissions in patients with STEMI, by a timeline follow-up form, before and during the current COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Between July 2018 and June 2020, two hundred and twelve patients diagnosed with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) were admitted to our medical center. Upon presentation, cases were assigned a timeline report sheet and each time interval, from onset of symptoms to the catheterization lab, was documented. The information was later evaluated to study potential excessive delays throughout ACS management. RESULTS: Our data evidenced that during the COVID-19 pandemic ACS admissions were reduced by 34.54%, in addition to several in-hospital delays in patient's ACS management including delays in door-to-ECG time (9.43 ± 18.21 vs. 18.41 ± 28.34, p = 0.029), ECG-to-balloon (58.25 ± 22.59 vs. 74.39 ± 50.30, p = 0.004) and door-to-balloon time (57.41 ± 27.52 vs. 69.31 ± 54.14, p = 0.04). CONCLUSIONS: During the pandemic a reduction in ACS admissions occurred in our hospital that accompanied with longer in-hospital TIT due to additional tests, triage, protocols to protect and prevent infection within hospital staff, and maintenance of adequate standards of care. However, door-to-balloon time was maintained under 90 min.","Bruoha, Sharon; Yosefy, Chaim; Gallego-Colon, Enrique; Rieck, Jonathan; Orlov, Yan; Osherov, Azriel; Jihad, Abu Hamed; Sherer, Yaniv; Viki, Nasi; Jafari, Jamal",Am J Emerg Med,770,1

During 2020, there were many research papers that proved our environmental and climate conditions were improving due to lockdown or large-scale restriction regulations. In contrast, the economic conditions deteriorated due to disruption in industry business activities and most people stayed at home and worked from home, which probably reduced the noise pollution. Methods: To assess whether there were differences in noise pollution before and during COVID-19. In this paper, we use various statistical methods following odds ratios, Wilcoxon and Fisher’s tests and Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) with various comparisons of prior selection. The outcome of interest for a parameter in Bayesian inference is complete posterior distribution. Roughly, the mean of the posterior will be clear with point approximation. That being said, the median is an available choice. Findings: To make the Bayesian MCMC work, we ran the sampling from the conditional posterior distributions. It is straightforward to draw random samples from these distributions if they have regular shapes using MCMC. The case of over-standard noise per time frame, number of noise petition cases, number of industry petition cases, number of motorcycles, number of cars and density of vehicles are significant at α=5%. In line with this, we prove that there were differences of noise pollution before and during COVID-19 in Taiwan.

Based on an analysis of 10,395 research publications about SARS-CoV-2 that mention at least one human gene, we report here that the COVID-19 literature up to mid-October 2020 follows a similar pattern. This means that a large number of host genes that have been implicated in SARS-CoV-2 infection by four genome-wide studies remain unstudied.

The risk of bias was assessed as 'low' for five of the seven mortality results and as 'some concerns' and 'high' in one trial each. There were 657/3100 (21.2%) and 1244/5654 (22%) deaths among patients randomized to AZM and standard of care, respectively.

Results: We found a strong relationship between reproductive number and mobility, with each 10% drop in mobility being associated with an expected 10.2% reduction in Rt compared to baseline. The effects of limitations on the size of gatherings, school and business closures, and stay-at-home orders were dominated by the trend over time, which was associated with a 48% decrease in the reproductive number, adjusting for the NPI. Conclusions: We found that the decrease in mobility associated with time may be due to individuals changing their behavior in response to perceived risk or external factors.","Fellows, Ian E.; Slayton, Rachel B.; Hakim, Avi J.",,770,26

OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate socioeconomic disparities in eHealth literacy and seeking of web-based information on COVID-19, and their associations with COVID-19 preventive behaviors. METHODS: The COVID-19 Health Information Survey (CoVHIns), using telephonic (n=500) and web-based surveys (n=1001), was conducted among adults in Hong Kong in April 2020. The Chinese eHealth literacy scale (eHEALS; score range 8-40) was used to measure eHealth literacy. COVID-19 preventive behaviors included wearing surgical masks, wearing fabric masks, washing hands, social distancing, and adding water or bleach to the household drainage system. Adjusted beta coefficients and the slope indices of inequality for the eHEALS score by socioeconomic status, adjusted odds ratios (aORs) for seeking of web-based information on COVID-19 by socioeconomic status, and aORs for the high adherence to preventive behaviors by the eHEALS score and seeking of web-based information on COVID-19 were calculated. RESULTS: The mean eHEALS score was 26.10 (SD 7.70). Age was inversely associated with the eHEALS score, but education and personal income were positively associated with the eHEALS score and seeking of web-based information on COVID-19 (for all, P for trend<.05). Participants who sought web-based information on COVID-19 showed high adherence to the practice of wearing surgical masks (aOR 1.56, 95% CI 1.15-2.13), washing hands (aOR 1.33, 95% CI 1.05-1.71), social distancing (aOR 1.48, 95% CI 1.14-1.93), and adding water or bleach to the household drainage system (aOR 1.67, 95% CI 1.28-2.18). Those with the highest eHEALS score displayed high adherence to the practice of wearing surgical masks (aOR 3.84, 95% CI 1.63-9.05), washing hands (aOR 4.14, 95% CI 2.46-6.96), social distancing (aOR 2.25, 95% CI 1.39-3.65), and adding water or bleach to the household drainage system (aOR 1.94, 95% CI 1.19-3.16), compared to those with the lowest eHEALS score. CONCLUSIONS: Chinese adults with a higher socioeconomic status had higher eHealth literacy and sought more web-based information on COVID-19; both these factors were associated with a high adherence to the guidelines for preventive behaviors during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Guo, Ziqiu; Zhao, Sheng Zhi; Guo, Ningyuan; Wu, Yongda; Weng, Xue; Wong, Janet Yuen-Ha; Lam, Tai Hing; Wang, Man Ping",J Med Internet Res,770,1

METHODS: We conducted a prospective cohort study of nulliparous women with singleton gestations, recruited between 110 and 136 weeks gestation. Data on the following were collected: maternal age; ethnicity; chronic diseases; use of fertility treatment; body mass index; mean arterial blood pressure (MAP); serum levels of pregnancy-associated plasma protein A (PAPP-A), placental growth factor (PlGF), soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase-1 (sFlt-1), alpha fetoprotein (AFP), free beta human chorionic gonadotropin (ß-hCG); and mean uterine artery pulsatility index (UtA-PI). We constructed a proportional hazard model for the prediction of preterm preeclampsia selected based on the Akaike information criterion. A receiver operating characteristic curve was created with the predicted risk from the final model. Our primary outcome was preterm preeclampsia and our secondary outcome was a composite of preeclampsia, small for gestational age, intrauterine death, and preterm birth. RESULTS: Among 4659 nulliparous women with singleton gestations, our final model included 4 variables: MAP MoM, log10PlGF MoM, log10AFP MoM and log10UtA-PI MoM. We obtained an area under the curve of 0.84 (95% CI 0.75-0.93) with a detection rate of preterm preeclampsia of 55% (95% CI 37%-73%) and a false-positive rate of 10%. Using a risk cut-off with a false-positive rate of 10%, the positive predictive value for our composite outcome was 33% (95% CI 29%-37%).

So far, there are no specific treatments for patients with coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19), and the treatments available today are based on previous experience with similar viruses such as severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and Influenza virus. In this article, we have tried to reach a therapeutic window of drugs available to patients with COVID-19. Cathepsin L is required for entry of the 2019-nCoV virus into the cell as target teicoplanin inhibits virus replication. Angiotensin-converting-enzyme 2 (ACE2) in soluble form as a recombinant protein can prevent the spread of coronavirus by restricting binding and entry. In patients with COVID-19, hydroxychloroquine decreases the inflammatory response and cytokine storm, but overdose causes toxicity and mortality. Neuraminidase inhibitors such as oseltamivir, peramivir, and zanamivir are invalid for 2019-nCoV and are not recommended for treatment but protease inhibitors such as lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r) inhibit the progression of MERS-CoV disease and can be useful for patients of COVID-19 and, in combination with Arbidol, has a direct antiviral effect on early replication of SARS-CoV. Ribavirin reduces hemoglobin concentrations in respiratory patients, and remdesivir improves respiratory symptoms. Use of ribavirin in combination with LPV/r in patients with SARS-CoV reduces acute respiratory distress syndrome and mortality, which has a significant protective effect with the addition of corticosteroids. Favipiravir increases clinical recovery and reduces respiratory problems and has a stronger antiviral effect than LPV/r. currently, appropriate treatment for patients with COVID-19 is an ACE2 inhibitor and a clinical problem reducing agent such as favipiravir in addition to hydroxychloroquine and corticosteroids.","Yousefi, Bahman; Valizadeh, Saeid; Ghaffari, Hadi; Vahedi, Azadeh; Karbalaei, Mohsen; Eslami, Majid",J. cell. physiol,770,1

Masks are thought to have two modes of effect: they prevent infection with COVID-19 in wearers; and prevent transmission by individuals with subclinical infection. We used a simple next-generation matrix approach to estimate the conditions under which masks would reduce the reproduction number of COVID-19 under a threshold of 1. Our model takes into account the possibility of assortative mixing, where mask users interact preferentially with other mask users. We make 3 key observations: 1. Masks, even with suboptimal efficacy in both prevention of acquisition and transmission of infection, could substantially decrease the reproduction number for COVID-19 if widely used. 2. Widespread masking may be sufficient to suppress epidemics where R has been brought close to 1 via other measures (e.g., distancing). 3. “Assortment” within populations (the tendency for interactions between masked individuals to be more likely than interactions between masked and unmasked individuals) would rapidly erode the impact of masks. As such, mask uptake needs to be fairly universal to have an effect. This simple model suggests that widespread uptake of masking could be determinative in suppressing COVID-19 epidemics in regions with R(t) at or near 1.","Fisman, David N.; Greer, Amy L.; Tuite, Ashleigh R.",Infect.

Two recent publications have speculated on the possibility of island nation refuges closing their borders to protect a human population against a catastrophic pandemic that poses an existential risk to humanity.3,4 The most recent paper described an index based on characteristics of an island nation’s population, location, resources and society. The authors used this index to conclude that Australia and New Zealand are the island nations most likely to be able to be both isolated from the rest of humanity in a pandemic and to also have the resources to reboot a thriving technological society following a pandemic that devastated the rest of global society as we know it, thereby acting as ‘island refuges’.4 Previous analysis in this journal has argued the economic case for border closure by island nations in the face of extreme pandemics.5 This work reported that 100 per cent border closure for six months by New Zealand, that results in the country avoiding any pandemic cases, could have a net present value of NZ$7.86 (US$5.29) billion for its “Scenario A” (involving half the mortality rate of the 1918 influenza pandemic) and NZ$144 (US$96.9) billion for preventing a pandemic with 10 times this mortality. There is evidence for travel restrictions being successful in controlling the spread of influenza between countries, and small islands successfully used protective sequestration and maritime quarantine to avoid the 1918–1919 influenza pandemic ). However, the 1918- 19 pandemic still appeared to reach most of the world’s islands. Drastic measures such as border closure have potentially large benefits (if successful) but also potentially major harmful consequences including economic harm. Some of these potential trade-offs are illustrated by the 2014 Ebola outbreak where the GDP of countries affected fell by 12% during the emergency even without successful complete border closures. The question remains, which pandemics, if any, might ever plausibly justify partitioning a segment of the human population through border closure by island nations to reduce major burdens of morbidity and mortality?

Containment measures have been imposed, with negative consequences on population mental health. Therefore, an increase in both symptomatology and mental disorder incidence is expected. This research aims to identify, describe and assess the empirical background on online strategies and recommendations developed by international organizations and governments to cope with the psychological impact of COVID-19 at a very early stage of the pandemic. METHODS: The PRISMA guidelines were adapted to review online documents. A new questionnaire was developed to identify the existence of common patterns in the selected documents. Questions were classified into three domains: COVID-19 information, mental health strategies and mental health recommendations. A two-step cluster analysis was carried out to highlight underlying behaviours in the data (patterns). The results are shown as spider graphs (pattern profiles) and conceptual maps (multidimensional links between questions). RESULTS: Twenty-six documents were included in the review. The questionnaire analysed document complexity and identified their common key mental health characteristics (i.e., does the respondent have the tools for dealing with stress, depression and anxiety?). Cluster analysis highlighted patterns from the questionnaire domains. Strong relationships between questions were identified, such as psychological tips for maintaining good mental health and coping with COVID-19 (question n° 4), describing some psychological skills to help people cope with anxiety and worry about COVID-19 (question n° 6) and promoting social connection at home (question n° 8). CONCLUSIONS: When fast results are needed to develop health strategies and policies, rapid reviews associated with statistical and graphical methods are essential. The results obtained from the proposed analytical procedure can be relevant to a) classify documents according to their complexity in structuring the information provided on how to cope with the psychological impact of COVID-19, b) develop new documents according to specific objectives matching population needs, c) improve document design to face unforeseen events, and d) adapt new documents to local situations. In this framework, the relevance of adapting e-mental health procedures to community mental health care model principles was highlighted, although some problems related to the digital gap must be considered.","Almeda, Nerea; García-Alonso, Carlos; Salvador-Carulla, Luis",BMC Psychiatry,770,16

The onset of severe acute respiratory distress syndrome led this patient to receive endotracheal intubation with mechanical ventilation and subsequent extracorporeal membrane oxygenation for life support. He was isolated in the negative air pressure room in the intensive care unit for infection control for this emerging respiratory infectious disease. This patient was also confronted with emotional pressures arising from the general uncertainty regarding the progress of this novel disease and from being isolated from the outside world. The care period was from April 5th to May 12th, 2020. The data was collected through direct care, written conversations, physical communication, observation, medical record reviews, diagnosis reports, and nursing assessments of physical, psychological, social, and spiritual distress. The health problems of this patient were identified as gas exchange disorder, infection, anxiety, and other problems. Our chest physiotherapy team comprised nurses, physicians, and respiratory therapists. After administering individualized treatments, including monitoring vital signs and installing an external life support system, the lung consolidation and lung collapse problems of the patient improved, allowing the ventilator to be removed. To address the patient's psychological problems, we used a humanoid diagram and whiteboard drawing as communication tools to explain to the patient the reasons for and functions of the different tubes on his body to reduce his anxiety and maintain the safe use of these tubes. Moreover, bedside care was replaced by mobile phone video and phone calls, allowing the patient to communicate with family members, which reduced his isolation-related anxiety and enhanced his compliance with treatment and care protocols. This experience supports the benefit of installing two-way video devices and viewing monitors in negative pressure rooms in the ICU to facilitate effective communications between patients, patient family members, and the medical team to reduce patient-perceived anxiety and social isolation. This case report provides a reference demonstrating a patient-centered caring model for treating COVID-19 patients in the ICU.","Wang, Yo-Ping; Chuang, Pao-Yu; Gone, Shu-Ing; Tseng, Chi-Ying",Hu Li Za Zhi,770,26

Annually, Botswana accounts only for a small proportion of cases (<<1%). Despite significantly reduced incidence rate, the country still experiences sporadic outbreaks that hamper the goal of malaria elimination. This review evaluated previous and current biological factors that impact malaria in Botswana, specifically focussing on the vectors, the parasite and the host. This was accomplished via a literature review evaluating these variables in Botswana. Current literature suggests that Anopheles arabiensis is the main malaria vector in the country. Several other potential vectors have been found widely distributed throughout Botswana in high numbers, yet remain largely unstudied with regards to their contribution to the country's malaria burden. We also report the most up to date list of all Anopheles species that have been found in Botswana. Plasmodium falciparum is responsible for the vast majority of symptomatic malaria in the country and some drug resistance markers have been documented for this species. Plasmodium vivax has been reported in asymptomatic subjects, even though a large proportion of the Botswana population appears to be Duffy antigen negative. Very little is known about the true distribution of P. vivax and no point of care testing infrastructure for this species exists in Botswana, making it difficult to tailor treatment to address possible recrudescence or relapse. Due to a genetically diverse population with a substantial Khoisan contribution into the Bantu genetic background, several phenotypes that potentially impact prevalence and severity of malaria exist within the country. These include sickle cell trait, Glucose-6-Phosphate Dehydrogenase deficiency, and Duffy negativity. This review highlights the information that currently exists on malaria in Botswana. It also postulates that a comprehensive understanding of these aforementioned biological factors may help to explain malaria persistence in Botswana.","Bango, Zackary Austin; Tawe, Leabaneng; Muthoga, Charles Waithaka; Paganotti, Giacomo Maria",Infect Genet Evol,770,18

This mini-review aims to provide a summary of available studies on exocrine pancreas involvement during COVID-19 infection. A search through MEDLINE/PubMed was conducted on the topic in hand. With regard to exocrine function, some studies highlight the presence of an associated hyperenzymemia (hyperamylasemia, hyperlipasemia), while others describe isolated and rare cases of acute pancreatitis. More attention should be paid to pancreatic impairment in subjects with COVID-19, as this may prove to be one of the elements aggravating its clinical course. Indeed, acute pancreatitis, especially when presenting in severe forms with hyperstimulation of the pro-inflammatory response, may represent a crucial factor in the progression of COVID-19, entailing both an increase in hospitalization days and in mortality rate.","Zippi, Maddalena; Hong, Wandong; Traversa, Giampiero; Maccioni, Francesca; De Biase, Dario; Gallo, Claudio; Fiorino, Sirio",Infez Med,770,24

To curb the spread of COVID-19, efficacious vaccination is emerging as essential in mitigating the disease and preventing deaths. Health care workers (HCW) are one of the first groups to receive vaccinations, so it is important to consider their attitudes to COVID-19 vaccination to better address barriers to widespread vaccination acceptance. This study aimed to evaluate variables that are linked with the recommendation of vaccines and intention to take-up vaccination against COVID-19 among the HCWs, in the context of the current pandemic. The study was conducted during the first week of the vaccination campaign dedicated to Italian HCWs, beginning in December 2020, and it involved all doctors in a public hospital in Sicily. The following questionnaires were administered: (1) The perceived vaccine trust questionnaire, measuring the degree of trust in vaccines by healthcare professionals both in general and for the protection of healthcare professionals themselves and patients;(2) the positive and negative affect scale-state (PANAS), for assessing positive and negative emotions in relation to their work as “frontline care providers”;(3) The locus of control of behaviour (LCB) to measure the extent to which subjects perceive responsibility for their personal behaviour (internal vs. external);(4) recommendation vaccines item, referring to the intention to recommend vaccination. The findings suggest that socio-demographic control variables (age, gender, and seniority) showed little or no predictive power in vaccine recommendation, while vaccine confidence, positive emotions, and internal locus of control were excellent predictors of vaccine recommendations by doctors. Younger doctors, both in age and experience, are more confident in vaccines and recommend them more frequently.

These enzymes are cytidine deaminases which transform cytosine into uracil. They preferentially mutate cytidine preceded by thymidine making the 5'TC motif their favored target. Viruses have evolved different strategies to evade APOBEC3 restriction. Certain viruses actively encode viral proteins antagonizing the APOBEC3s, others passively face the APOBEC3 selection pressure thanks to a depleted genome for APOBEC3-targeted motifs. Hence, the APOBEC3s left on the genome of certain viruses an evolutionary footprint. The aim of our study is the identification of these viruses having a genome shaped by the APOBEC3s. We analyzed the genome of 33,400 human viruses for the depletion of APOBEC3-favored motifs. We demonstrate that the APOBEC3 selection pressure impacts at least 22% of all currently annotated human viral species. The papillomaviridae and polyomaviridae are the most intensively footprinted families; evidencing a selection pressure acting genome-wide and on both strands. Members of the parvoviridae family are differentially targeted in term of both magnitude and localization of the footprint. Interestingly, a massive APOBEC3 footprint is present on both strands of the B19 erythroparvovirus; making this viral genome one of the most cleaned sequences for APOBEC3-favored motifs. We also identified the endemic coronaviridae as significantly footprinted. Interestingly, no such footprint has been detected on the zoonotic MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 coronaviruses. In addition to viruses that are footprinted genome-wide, certain viruses are footprinted only on very short sections of their genome. That is the case for the gamma-herpesviridae and adenoviridae where the footprint is localized on the lytic origins of replication. A mild footprint can also be detected on the negative strand of the reverse transcribing HIV-1, HIV-2, HTLV-1 and HBV viruses. Together, our data illustrate the extent of the APOBEC3 selection pressure on the human viruses and identify new putatively APOBEC3-targeted viruses.","Poulain, Florian; Lejeune, Noémie; Willemart, Kévin; Gillet, Nicolas A",PLoS Pathog,770,19

This study fills this gap by examining the self-reported mental health (SRMH) of immigrants by admission category and other immigration dimensions (e.g., source world region and duration since landing) and making comparisons with Canadian-born respondents to a population-based survey. DATA AND METHODS: Based on four cycles (2011 to 2014) of the Canadian Community Health Survey (CCHS) linked to the Longitudinal Immigration Database (IMDB), odds ratios of high (i.e., excellent or very good) SRMH among Canadian-born respondents and IMDB-linked immigrants are compared using logistic regression. Among the IMDB immigrant population, high SRMH was also examined according to the above-mentioned immigration dimensions. Adjusted results were hierarchically controlled for age, sex, social and economic factors, and sense of belonging. RESULTS: Age-sex adjusted results show that immigrants, especially refugees, are less likely than the Canadian-born population to report high mental health levels, but these differences disappeared after full adjustment. The odds of immigrants having high SRMH differed more by source world region and duration since landing. For example, fully adjusted results show support for the HIE, with recent immigrants (interviewed within 10 years of landing) more likely to report high SRMH than either the Canadian-born population or established immigrants. Greater odds of high SRMH among recent immigrants also holds across admission classes and for selected world regions. DISCUSSION: This study provides new evidence on differences in mental health between Canadian-born individuals and immigrants by various characteristics. Results support a deterioration of the HIE in SRMH and identify factors significantly associated with SRMH. This study can also serve as a baseline for further studies on the impact of COVID-19 on immigrants' mental health by immigrant category.","Ng, Edward; Zhang, Haozhen",Health Rep,770,16

During the emergency state declared in Portugal in the months of March and April 2020, there was a severe reduction in medical activity in order to reduce the pressure on health systems. This study aimed to assess the impact of COVID-19 in gastroenterology departments across Portugal and the strategies developed to overcome this challenge. Methods: This was a cross-sectional study based on an online survey. A detailed questionnaire concerning different aspects of gastroenterology department activity was sent via e-mail to the heads of gastroenterology departments of Portuguese District Hospitals (Nucleo de Gastroenterologia dos Hospitais Distritais). Two periods were assessed, i.e., the emergency state and the recovery period between May and September. The responses were collected between September and October 2020. Results: A total of 21 hospitals were enrolled (80.8% response rate). Twenty-eight percent of the responders reported healthcare professionals from their unit infected with COVID-19. At least 1 member (mostly fellows) of the department was deployed to another workplace in 66.7% of the hospitals. During the emergency state, 47.6% of the hospitals only performed urgent/emergent endoscopic procedures. In 38.5% of the hospitals the need to ration personal protective equipment led to the suspension of endoscopic training. Regarding the recovery period, nonurgent procedures were restarted in almost all of the centers. The same was reported for the colorectal cancer screening program. Remarkably, 81% of the responders confirmed that they had postponed procedures at patients' request for ""fear of getting infected."" Remote consultation was maintained in 81% of the hospitals. Globally, the fellows had resumed their training. Discussion/Conclusion: This study provides a snapshot of the impact and consequences of the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic across Portuguese hospitals. It is important to understand how the gastroenterology world dealt with the first impact of COVID-19 and what strategies were implemented in order to better prepare for what might follow.","Leal, T.; Goncalves, M.; Mocanu, I.; Carvalho, R.; Gloria, L.; Nucleo, Gastroente",Ge Portuguese Journal of Gastroenterology,770,22

Such misinformation has confused people. To be able to detect such COVID-19 misinformation, an effective detection method should be applied to obtain more accurate information. This will help people and researchers easily differentiate between true and fake news. The objective of this research was to introduce an enhanced evolutionary detection approach to obtain better results compared with the previous approaches. The proposed approach aimed to reduce the number of symmetrical features and obtain a high accuracy after implementing three wrapper feature selections for evolutionary classifications using particle swarm optimization (PSO), the genetic algorithm (GA), and the salp swarm algorithm (SSA). The experiments were conducted on one of the popular datasets called the Koirala dataset. Based on the obtained prediction results, the proposed model revealed an optimistic and superior predictability performance with a high accuracy (75.4%) and reduced the number of features to 303. In addition, by comparison with other state-of-the-art classifiers, our results showed that the proposed detection method with the genetic algorithm model outperformed other classifiers in the accuracy.","Al-Ahmad, Bilal Al-Zoubi Ala’ M.; Abu Khurma, Ruba Aljarah Ibrahim",Symmetry,770,24

The aim was to recognize the risk factors for nonpsychotic postpartum mood and anxiety disorders (NPMADs) in women during the pandemic and state of emergency police lockdown in Serbia. METHODS: We assessed 108 postpartum women who completed the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) and an additional survey constructed for this study. We also used the additional, previously mentioned survey, in 67 healthy age-matched women with children who were &#8805;2 years of age. The additional survey allowed us to gain insight into the impact of the pandemic as well as postpartum period on the risk of NPMADs. RESULTS: In 16 (14.8%) subjects we found a score &#8805;10 on EPDS. Higher rates on the EPDS were noticed in elderly, single, and unemployed, women who lost their jobs due to the pandemic, or women who were dissatisfied with their household income (p < 0.05). The risk of NPMADs was linked significantly to quarantine, and social isolation, the absence of social support, as well as having emotional problems. Postpartum women, compared to non-postpartum women, were more anxious and had feelings of helplessness during social isolation. CONCLUSION: Understanding the factors that increase the risk of NPMADs during the pandemic could help prevent mental disorders during a possible future pandemic.","Stojanov, Jelena; Stankovic, Miodrag; Zikic, Olivera; Stankovic, Matija; Stojanov, Aleksandar",Int J Psychiatry Med,770,18

DESIGN AND METHODS: The incidence rates per 100,000 inhabitants and the case fatality ratio (CFR) (dependent variables) in all Italian regions were calculated in January 2021 at John Hopkins University Coronavirus Center. The independent variables were: -Minimum average temperatures in the same month (January) of 2020, -Average pollution of PM10 in the air in each region in the last year available reported on a 0-10 scale to 0 = total absence of PM10 to 10 maximum pollutions. -Number of places in hotels occupied per inhabitants in 2020. Linear regression and Multiple Regression Analysis were carried out. RESULTS: The spread of the COVID-19 in the Italian regions seems to be related to pollution of PM10, the number of beds occupied in hotels (as an index of mobility and temperature (indirect correlation). On the contrary, the CFR correlates inversely with temperature but not with pollution. Measuring the concomitant effect of two independent variables by means of Multiple Regression Analysis, temperature and pollution show a synergistic effect on COVID-19 incidence. CONCLUSIONS: The study seems to confirm the literature on the influence of temperature on the lethality of COVID-19 but adds the new results of an inverse relationship between the spread of the virus and low temperature in regions between the Mediterranean area (which includes southern Italy and Sicily and Sardinia islands) and the cold European temperate zone which includes the northern regions under the Alps.

As information emerges regarding the impact of ""lockdown measures"" and changes to clinical practice worldwide; there is no comparative information emerging from the United Kingdom with regard to major trauma. METHODS: This observational study from a UK Major Trauma Centre matched a cohort of patients admitted during a 10-week period of the SARS-CoV-2-pandemic (09/03/2020-18/05/2020) to a historical cohort of patients admitted during a similar time period in 2019 (11/03/2019-20/05/2019). Differences in demographics, Clinical Frailty Scale, SARS-CoV-2 status, mechanism of injury and injury severity were compared using Fisher's exact and Chi-squared tests. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression analyses examined the associated factors that predicted 30-days mortality. RESULTS: A total of 642 patients were included, with 405 in the 2019 and 237 in the 2020 cohorts, respectively. 4/237(1.69%) of patients in the 2020 cohort tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. There was a 41.5% decrease in the number of trauma admissions in 2020. This cohort was older (median 46 vs 40 years), had more comorbidities and were frail (p < 0.0015). There was a significant difference in mechanism of injury with a decrease in vehicle related trauma, but an increase in falls. There was a twofold increased risk of mortality in the 2020 cohort which in adjusted multivariable models, was explained by injury severity and frailty. A positive SARS-CoV-2 status was not significantly associated with increased mortality when adjusted for other variables. CONCLUSION: Patients admitted during the COVID-19 pandemic were older, frailer, more co-morbid and had an associated increased risk of mortality.","Adiamah, Alfred; Thompson, Amari; Lewis-Lloyd, Christopher; Dickson, Edward; Blackburn, Lauren; Moody, Nick; Gida, Sunil; La Valle, Angelo; Reilly, John-Joe; Saunders, John; Brooks, Adam",Eur. j. trauma emerg. surg,770,16

This cross-sectional descriptive study recruited participants with assistance from South Asian community centres and organisations. A total of 352 participants completed questionnaires to assess their level of KAP towards COVID-19. The mean knowledge score was 5.38/10, indicating a relatively low knowledge level. The participants expressed certain misconceptions regarding the prevention of COVID-19 infection. They perceived a mild risk related to the disease, had positive attitudes regarding its prevention and often implemented recommended disease-preventive measures, such as maintaining social distance (88.1%) and wearing masks in public (94.3%). Participants who were male, had a secondary school education or lower and who perceived a lower risk of being infected and lower self-efficacy were less likely to implement preventive measures. Culturally and linguistically appropriate health education could be developed to increase the knowledge of South Asians, especially those with lower education levels, about COVID-19 and to encourage them to implement the necessary preventive measures.","Wong, Cho Lee; Chen, Jieling; Chow, Ka Ming; Law, Bernard M H; Chan, Dorothy N S; So, Winnie K W; Leung, Alice W Y; Chan, Carmen W H",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),770,26

In response to the pandemic, numerous studies have tried to identify the causes and symptoms of the disease. Emerging evidence supports recently acquired anosmia (complete loss of smell) and hyposmia (partial loss of smell) as symptoms of COVID-19, but studies of olfactory dysfunction show a wide range of prevalence from 5% to 98%. We undertook a search of Pubmed/Medline and Google Scholar with the keywords ""COVID-19,"" ""smell,"" and/or ""olfaction."" We included any study that quantified smell loss (anosmia and hyposmia) as a symptom of COVID-19. Studies were grouped and compared based on the type of method used to measure smell loss-subjective measures, such as self-reported smell loss, versus objective measures using rated stimuli-to determine if prevalence differed by method type. For each study, 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated from point estimates of olfactory disturbances. We identified 34 articles quantifying anosmia as a symptom of COVID-19 (6 objective and 28 subjective), collected from cases identified from January 16 to April 30, 2020. The pooled prevalence estimate of smell loss was 77% when assessed through objective measurements (95% CI of 61.4-89.2%) and 44% with subjective measurements (95% CI of 32.2-57.0%). Objective measures are a more sensitive method to identify smell loss as a result of infection with SARS-CoV-2; the use of subjective measures, while expedient during the early stages of the pandemic, underestimates the true prevalence of smell loss.","Hannum, Mackenzie E; Ramirez, Vicente A; Lipson, Sarah J; Herriman, Riley D; Toskala, Aurora K; Lin, Cailu; Joseph, Paule V; Reed, Danielle R",Chem. senses,770,13

In response, Foodshare, the regional food bank serving Greater Hartford, Connecticut, created a drive-through distribution program to meet the immediate food needs of residents. Our team at Foodshare's Institute for Hunger Research & Solutions conducted two surveys of people receiving food at the drive-through distribution to help inform Foodshare's programming and response to the pandemic. Results show that 70% of households receiving food had never gone to a food pantry or other program to receive free food prior to COVID-19, and 67% said they come at least once a week. Additionally, 86% of guests are not going elsewhere to receive free food and only 37% know of other places to get free food. The majority of people receiving food at the drive-through distribution were people of color, who are those most affected by COVID-19 from both health and financial perspectives. From April to August 2020, Foodshare served an average of 1,500 households each day and more than 150,000 cars total at the drive-through distribution alone. Despite serving an immediate need for food, the drive-through model presents challenges, particularly during the New England winter with snow and freezing temperatures, and is an expensive endeavor. Foodshare and other food banks will need to pivot again from short-term pandemic assistance to longer-term approaches to create dignified, convenient, and sustainable access to healthy food for additional people struggling with food insecurity. Food banks can also leverage their extensive platforms of volunteers and donors to advocate for policy changes that will ensure economic stability and food security.","Cavaliere, B.

Fever, dry cough and fatigue were the main manifestations, but the primary concern is cases that deteriorated to severe pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The outbreak of COVID- 19 in Israel, in March 2020 caused major changes in the routine work in hospitals. Hasharon hospital, a small community hospital in Petah Tikvah was converted to corona patients' admissions only. In accordance with this new reality, the physiotherapy service prepared itself to provide treatments tailored to the clinical needs of the Covid 19 patients and the quarantine conditions of these patients' hospitalization. During a period of 2 months, we built a unique protocol adjusted to isolated patients and staff, including telemedicine and hands-on treatment.

Patients with SLE are a unique population when considering the risk of contracting COVID-19 and infection outcomes. The use of systemic glucocorticoids and immunosuppressants, and underlying organ damage from SLE are potential susceptibility factors. Most patients with SLE have evidence of high type I interferon activity, which may theoretically act as an antiviral line of defense or contribute to the development of a deleterious hyperinflammatory response in COVID-19. Other immunopathogenic mechanisms of SLE may overlap with those described in COVID-19, thus, studies in SLE could provide some insight into immune responses occurring in severe cases of the viral infection. We reviewed the literature to date on COVID-19 in patients with SLE and provide an in-depth review of current research in the area, including immune pathway activation, epidemiology, clinical features, outcomes, and the psychosocial impact of the pandemic in those with autoimmune disease.","Fernandez-Ruiz, Ruth; Paredes, Jacqueline L; Niewold, Timothy B",Transl. res,770,16

Similar to other medical specialities and general practice (1), to continue providing a service for our service users, we employed other means of communication including telephone and video consultations (although face-to-face consultations were available for high clinical concern and/or identified risk). We set out to explore the acceptability of remote consultation for service users of an older adult (&gt;65 years) Community Mental Health Team (CMHT).Reference: BMJ 2020;371:m3945MethodA total of 34 service users were selected randomly from the CMHT caseload (9% of total 372 caseload). 4 clinicians were involved in collecting data between July and October 2020. We used our trust's (East London Foundation Trust) standard questionnaire on patient satisfaction and contacted individuals by telephone to complete the survey.ResultFor both questions of ‘I felt listened to by the team’ and ‘I feel I have been given enough information regarding my care’ 17 (50%) responders ‘agreed’ with this statement and an additional 13 (38%) ‘strongly agreed’ (total of 88%). For the statement ‘I feel involved in decisions about my care’ 16 (47%) responders ‘agreed’ and a further 11 (32%) responders ‘strongly agreed’ with this statement. The statement ‘The professionals involved in my care talk to each other and we all work as a team’ had 15 (44%) responders ‘agree’ and 13 (38%) responders ‘strongly agree’. When asked ‘If you experienced telephone/video sessions, were these helpful?’ 31 responders said ‘yes’.ConclusionOverall most responders agreed or strongly agreed that they felt listened to, were given enough information about their care, felt involved in decisions about their care and that they worked as a team with the professionals involved in their care. 91% of responders felt that the video/telephone sessions had been helpful. These data have provided reassurance that telemedicine methods were a useful substitute for face-to-face consultations during the early stages of the pandemic. However this was a small scale study. This study cannot tell us about the experience after the initial 6 months of the pandemic, how often it would be optimal for people have face to face reviews, or whether satisfaction with telemedicine altered over a longer period. We were also not able to tell whether the experience varied for those who had less robust and longstanding relationships with their clinicians.","Dineva, Darena Altun Sukran Twaha Tahiya Brown Juliette",BJPsych Open,770,1

It was demonstrated that cancer patients have an increased risk of developing a worse symptomatology upon severe acute respiratory syndrome associated coronavirus‐2 (SARS‐CoV‐2) infection, often leading to hospitalization and intensive care. The consequences of this pandemic for oncology are really heavy, as the entire healthcare system got reorganized. Both oncologists and cancer patients are experiencing rescheduling of treatments and disruptions of appointments with a concurrent surge of fear and stress. In this review all the up‐to‐date findings, concerning the association between COVID‐19 and cancer, are reported. A remaining very debated question regards the use of an innovative class of anti‐cancer molecules, the immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), given their modulating effects on the immune system. For that reason, administration of ICIs to cancer patients represents a question mark during this pandemic, as its correlation with COVID‐19‐associated risks is still under investigation. Based on the mechanisms of action of ICIs and the current evidence, we suggest that ICIs not only can be safely administered to cancer patients, but they might even be beneficial in COVID‐19‐positive cancer patients, by exerting an immune‐stimulating action.","Vivarelli, Silvia; Falzone, Luca; Grillo, Caterina Maria; Scandurra, Giuseppa; Torino, Francesco; Libra, Massimo",Cancers,770,1

However, the spreading patterns of the disease in cities are still not clear. Historically, preventing and controlling pandemics in cities has always been challenging due to various factors such as higher population density, higher mobility of people, and higher contact frequency. To shed more light on the spread patterns of the pandemic, in this study we analyze 43,000 confirmed COVID-19 cases at the neighborhood level in Tehran, the capital of Iran. To examine spatio-temporal patterns and place-based factors contributing to the spread of the pandemic, we used exploratory spatial data analysis and spatial regression. We developed a geo-referenced database composed of 12 quantitative place-based variables related to physical attributes, land use and public transportation facilities, and demographic status. We also used the geographically weighted regression model for the local examination of spatial non-stationarity. According to the results, population density (R2 = 0.88) and distribution of neighborhood centers (R2 = 0.59), drugstores (R2 = 0.64), and chain stores (R2 = 0.59) are the main factors contributing to the spread of the disease. Additionally, density of public transportation facilities showed a varying degree of contribution. Overall, our findings suggest that demographic composition and major neighborhood-level physical attributes are important factors explaining high rates of infection and mortality. Results contribute to gaining a better understanding of the role of place-based attributes that may contribute to the spread of the pandemic and can inform actions aimed at achieving Sustainable Development Goals, particularly Goals 3 and 11.","Lak, Azadeh Sharifi Ayyoob Badr Siamak Zali Alireza Maher Ali Mostafavi Ehsan Khalili Davood",Sustainable Cities and Society,770,24

For capacity planning of healthcare providers and to optimize protection of healthcare workers (HCW) in SARS-CoV­2 pandemics, it is essential to know the risk of infection and potential immunity status of staff dealing with COVID-19 patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We examined seropravalence of SARS-CoV­2 IgM/IgG antibodies (AB) in HCW of a region with the highest rate of infection (1570/100,000) during COVID-19 pandemic in Germany, 4 months after its start. Employees of a nonmedical company (MU) served as control group. Demographic data, medical history and working situation were recorded. RESULTS: A total of 1838 HCW and 986 MU volunteered to participate. Seroprevalence for SARS-CoV­2 in HCW was 15.1% and 3.7% in MU. Among HCWs, nurses had a seropositivity of 20.0%, ICU personnel 20.3%, housekeepers 19.3%, physicians 12.0%, medical services (e.g., radiology, physiotherapy) 11.3%, administration 7.1% and technical services 6%. Symptoms typical for COVID-19 were not experienced by 10% of seropositive HCWs. CONCLUSION: Seroprevalence of SARS-CoV­2 antibodies in HCW of a region heavily affected by COVID-19 is with 15.1% significantly higher than in a control group of nonmedical staff with 3.7%. Infection rate in HCW was higher in staff with close contact to infected patients. Seropositivity in ICU personnel is higher than in other clinical professions. The occupational risk for housekeepers seems to be underestimated.","Finkenzeller, T; Faltlhauser, A; Dietl, K-H; Paetzel, C; Szczypien, N; Klawonn, F; Bodmann, K-F; von Meyer, A",Med. Klin.

Obtained concentrations have been treated by a combination of several receptor-oriented models to reveal source contributions to the suburban PM2.5 at different spatial scales. Applied positive matrix factorization analysis indicated five main groups of emission sources: biomass burning (14.5%), traffic (3.9%), regional combustion/secondary sulphates (28.8%), local combustion/secondary nitrates (29.7%) and soil (5.4%). Local heating units had been pointed out as dominant contributors by long-range transport and ground-wind circulation analyses. Air masses circulating over the Balkan Peninsula denoted regional emissions as responsible for the high concentrations of secondary sulphates. Local and long-range transport analyses combined suggested that the BB and the LC/NO3 originated from the wider urban area. Several Saharan dust episodes were detected as well.

There are currently no approved antiviral drugs or vaccine options available for treatment. Patients with severe cases of COVID-19 are receiving supportive care to manage life-threatening symptoms of viral pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Clinical and pathological evidence suggests that patients with severe COVID-19 infections suffer from cytokine storm syndrome, which leads to unfavorable health outcomes. Unfortunately, the conventional pharmacotherapies for cytokine storm syndrome are associated with immunosuppression and various other side effects that may worsen the patients' health status and healing capability. This study is to review the literature on how zinc status may affect susceptibility and outcomes of a viral infection, as well as to explore the possible beneficial effects of supplementing zinc to alleviate COVID-19 duration and severity. We propose zinc supplementation as a viable therapeutic approach when used alone or in combination with other drugs to combat cytokine storm syndrome in COVID-19 patients. The supplementation may be especially effective for elderly patients or patients with co-morbidity already deficient in zinc. More level I randomized controlled studies are needed to determine the clinical efficacy of zinc supplementation as a potential low-cost intervention to reduce morbidity and mortality due to pneumonia and ARDS in COVID-19 patients.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: In this review we identified 136 published studies in PubMed's curated literature database LitCovid on SARS-CoV­2 detection methods in tissues and evaluated them regarding sources of error, specificity, and sensitivity of the methods, taking into account our own experience. RESULTS: Currently, no sufficiently specific histomorphological alterations or diagnostic features for COVID-19 are known. Therefore, three approaches for SARS-CoV­2 detection are used: RNA, proteins/antigens, or morphological detection by electron microscopy. In the preanalytical phase, the dominant source of error is tissue quality, especially the different intervals between sample collection and processing or fixation (and its duration) and specifically the interval between death and sample collection in autopsies. However, this information is found in less than half of the studies (e.g., in only 42% of autopsy studies). Our own experience and first studies prove the significantly higher sensitivity and specificity of RNA-based detection methods compared to antigen or protein detection by immunohistochemistry or immunofluorescence. Detection by electron microscopy is time consuming and difficult to interpret. CONCLUSIONS: Different methods are available for the detection of SARS-CoV­2 in tissue. Currently, RNA detection by RT-PCR is the method of choice. However, extensive validation studies and method harmonization are not available and are absolutely necessary.","von Stillfried, Saskia; Boor, Peter",Pathologe,770,29

There is no effective intervention for the severe patients, and their prognosis is poor. It is worth noting that in the fight against COVID-19, China has always put equal emphasis on both Chinese and Western medicine. Traditional Chinese medicine has played an important role in the whole process. It is of great significance to discuss the rules and characteristics of the prescription of traditional Chinese medicine in the treatment of COVID-19. In this study, information was collected from 444 severe COVID-19 patients who were admitted to a hospital designated to treat patients with severe COVID-19 in Wuhan before March 20, 2020. We collected traditional Chinese medicine prescriptions for patients with severe COVID-19, referred to Chinese Pharmacopoeia to standardize the names of traditional Chinese medicine, and extract the property, flavor and channel tropism of traditional Chinese medicines to analyze the rules of the prescriptions. IBM SPSS Modeler 18.0 software was used to conduct correlation analysis of traditional Chinese medicine. Effective traditional Chinese medicines against COVID-19 was identified by the TCMATCOV platform. In the end, 1 532 effective prescriptions were included. Among them, the high-frequency drugs are Poria, Astragali Radix, Pogostemonis Herba, Armeniacae Semen Amarum, Atractylodis Macrocephalae Rhizoma, Pinelliae Rhizoma, Glycyrrhizae Radix et Rhizoma, Magnoliae Officinalis Cortex, Ephedrae Herba, Cinna-momi Ramulus. Most of the drugs have the following functions: resolving dampness, replenishing deficiency, resolving phlegm, cough, and asthma. The core combinations are Pogostemonis Herba-Poria, Astragali Radix-Pogostemonis Herba-Poria, Amomi Fructus-Poria, Amomi Fructus-Pogostemonis Herba, Amomi Fructus-Astragali Radix. The majority of the medicines are with cold and warm properties, and the proportions are 41.03% and 38.46%, respectively. The medicinal flavors are mainly concentrated in sweet and bitter, and the proportions are 34.71% and 30.58%, respectively. The meridian of the drug is more into the lung, stomach and spleen, with lung accounting for 22.87%. From the analysis of high-frequency drugs to the core combinations, one can see that the main treatment principle for severe COVID-19 is to remove internal and external dampness, protect the spleen and stomach, remove evil energy, and support righteousness. TCMATCOV platform was used to calculate the network disturbances of the high-frequency drugs. It was found that the traditional Chinese medicine with a high disturbance score accounted for a high proportion of the classic anti-COVID-19 prescriptions used by clinicians. Among them, the drugs with top scores are Ephedrae Herba, Citri Reticulatae Pericarpium, Eupatorii Herba, Platycodonis Radix, Cinnamomi Ramulus, Astragali Radix, Magnoliae Officinalis Cortex, Atractylodis Macrocephalae Rhizoma, Pogostemonis Herba, Scutellariae Radix.

METHODS The presence of COVID-19 was investigated in 167 patients with BCG and 167 without bladder cancer. All patients were compatible with COVID-19 infection. Patients with RT-PCR positive for SARS-CoV-2 and/or Chest CT positive for viral pneumonia between March and May 2020 were included in the study. RESULTS A total of 334 patients were included in the study. The mean age of the 167 patients in the study group was 71.1±14.2 1 (min. 38.0- max. 98.0 years), 141 (84.4%) were male. The mean age of the 167 patients in the control group was 70.5±13.8 years (min. 41.0- max. 96.0 years), and 149 were male (p&gt; 0.05).

To date, no vaccines or specific antiviral drugs have been approved for the treatment of this disease in clinic. Herein, therapeutic antibodies for SARS-CoV-2 were obtained from hyperimmune equine plasma. First, a recombinant SARS-CoV-2 spike protein receptor-binding domain (RBD) was obtained in gram-level quantities through high-cell density fermentation of Chinese hamster ovary cells. Then, the binding of the RBD to the SARS-CoV-2 receptor, human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, was verified by several biochemical methods. The efficacy of the RBD in triggering antibody response in vivo was subsequently tested in both mice and equines, and the results showed that the RBD triggered high-titer neutralizing antibody production in vivo. Immunoglobulin F(ab')2 fragments were prepared from equine antisera via removal of the Fc region from the immunoglobulins. Finally, a neutralization test with live virus demonstrated that RBD-specific F(ab')2 inhibited SARS-CoV-2 with an EC50 of 0.07 µg/ml and an EC80 of 0.18 µg/ml, showing a potent inhibitory effect on SARS-CoV-2.

Often used to compare outbreaks and forecast pandemic risk, this single number belies the complexity that different epidemics can exhibit, even when they have the same R0. Here, we reformulate and extend a classic result from random network theory to forecast the size of an epidemic using estimates of the distribution of secondary infections, leveraging both its average R0 and the underlying heterogeneity. Importantly, epidemics with lower R0 can be larger if they spread more homogeneously (and are therefore more robust to stochastic fluctuations). We illustrate the potential of this approach using different real epidemics with known estimates for R0, heterogeneity and epidemic size in the absence of significant intervention. Further, we discuss the different ways in which this framework can be implemented in the data-scarce reality of emerging pathogens. Lastly, we demonstrate that without data on the heterogeneity in secondary infections for emerging infectious diseases like COVID-19 the uncertainty in outbreak size ranges dramatically. Taken together, our work highlights the critical need for contact tracing during emerging infectious disease outbreaks and the need to look beyond R0.","Hébert-Dufresne, Laurent; Althouse, Benjamin M; Scarpino, Samuel V; Allard, Antoine",J R Soc Interface,770,20

They provide a favorable environment for plasma anticoagulant proteins, including antithrombin, tissue factor pathway inhibitor, and protein C. Under septic conditions, however, the anticoagulant properties of endothelial cells are compromised. Rather, activated/injured endothelial cells can provide a scaffold for intravascular coagulation. For example, the expression of tissue factor, an important initiator of the coagulation pathway, is induced on the surface of activated endothelial cells. Phosphatidylserine, a high-affinity scaffold for gamma-carboxyglutamate domain containing coagulation factors, including FII, FVII, FIX, and FX, is externalized to the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane of injured endothelial cells. Hemodilution decreases not only coagulation factors but also plasma anticoagulant proteins, resulting in unleashed activation of coagulation on the surface of activated/injured endothelial cells. The aberrant activation of coagulation can be suppressed in part by the supplementation of recombinant antithrombin and recombinant thrombomodulin. This review aims to overview the physiological and pathological functions of endothelial cells along with proof-of-concept in vitro studies.

METHODS: All patients with carcinoid HD that underwent cardiac CT, either preoperatively or for assessment of coronary arteries, between Apr-2006 and Dec-2019 at the Royal Free Hospital, UK, were reviewed. RESULTS: Of 32 patients with carcinoid HD, 29 (91%) had heart valve involvement. Abnormalities of the tricuspid and pulmonary valves were present in all patients, affecting all three leaflets in 23/26 (89%) unoperated patients for both valves. The aortic valve was affected in 4/29 (14%) patients and the mitral valve in 5/29 (17%). Left heart valves were affected in 6/29 (21%) patients. One patient (1/29; 3%) had all four valves affected. Severe changes with significant valvular regurgitation were seen in &#8805;75% of patients with tricuspid, pulmonary, and aortic valve abnormalities. Three patients had carcinoid myocardial metastases (3/32; 9%) and one patient had constrictive pericarditis (1/32; 3%). Ten patients had surgery of whom four (40%) had invasive coronary angiography preoperatively. Ten patients had a patent foramen ovale. Cardiac CT allowed an accurate assessment of damage to different leaflets/cusps, particularly of the pulmonary valve, where visualization with echocardiography was often (3/8; 38%) incomplete. CONCLUSION: Cardiac CT is a powerful tool for assessment of cardiac valve abnormalities, coronary arteries and the spatial relationship of coronary arteries with myocardial metastasis in patients with carcinoid HD, and should form part of multimodal imaging of this complex pathology.","Davar, Joseph; Lazoura, Olga; Caplin, Martyn E; Toumpanakis, Christos",,770,20

We aimed to estimate the reproductive number of SARS-CoV-2 in the Hubei Province and evaluate the risk of an acute respiratory coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak outside China by using a mathematical model and stochastic simulations. RESULTS: We constructed a mathematical model of SARS-CoV-2 transmission dynamics, estimated the rate of transmission, and calculated the reproductive number in Hubei Province by using case-report data from January 11 to February 6, 2020. The possible number of secondary cases outside China was estimated by stochastic simulations in various scenarios of reductions in the duration to quarantine and rate of transmission. The rate of transmission was estimated as 0.8238 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.8095-0.8382), and the basic reproductive number as 4.1192 (95% CI 4.0473-4.1912). Assuming the same rate of transmission as in Hubei Province, the possibility of no local transmission is 54.9% with a 24-h quarantine strategy, and the possibility of more than 20 local transmission cases is 7% outside of China. CONCLUSION: The reproductive number for SARS-CoV-2 transmission dynamics is significantly higher compared to that of the previous SARS epidemic in China. This implies that human-to-human transmission is a significant factor for contagion in Hubei Province. Results of the stochastic simulation emphasize the role of quarantine implementation, which is critical to prevent and control the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak outside China.","Kim, Soyoung; Choi, Sunhwa; Ko, Youngsuk; Ki, Moran; Jung, Eunok",Theor Biol Med Model,770,8

METHODS: This was a cross-sectional time-series study of clinical virology results from children tested for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 in Southern Connecticut and areas of New York and Rhode Island. Data collected include demographics, hospital admission, changes in percent positive tests over time, detection intervals in persistently positive children and cycle threshold values. The setting was the Yale New Haven Health System has 6 hospitals at 4 Connecticut locations, 1 hospital in Rhode Island and ambulatory locations in Connecticut, Rhode Island and New York. Participants included twenty-three-thousand one-hundred thirty-seven children &#8804; 18 years of age, tested for coronavirus disease 2019 at an ambulatory testing site, the emergency department or on an inpatient unit within the Yale New Haven Health System. RESULTS: Among all tests, 3.2% were positive. Older children consistently made up the larger portion of positive pediatric cases, regardless of community prevalence. Increased pediatric cases later in the pandemic when prevalence in adults was relatively low correlates with a higher number of tests performed in children and not with an increased positivity rate. No significant changes in trends of positivity were detected after the reopening of schools. Symptomatic and asymptomatic children had similar cycle threshold values regardless of age, and a subset of children demonstrated persistent viral detection, some for as long as 6 weeks. CONCLUSION: An increase in pediatric cases documented in the late summer was predominately due to increased access to testing for children. The percent positivity in children did not change in the first 3 weeks after school opened.

Here we show that deletion of the protein IX gene from a HAdV-5 vector enhanced the reporter gene delivery 5 to 25-fold, specifically to Coxsackie and Adenovirus Receptor (CAR)-negative cell lines. Deletion of the protein IX gene also resulted in enhanced activation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells. The mechanism for the enhanced transduction is obscure. No differences in fiber loading, integrin-dependency of transduction, or factor-X binding could be established between protein IX-containing and protein IX-deficient particles.

Conversely, Uruguay stands out as an outlier managing this health crisis with remarkable success. Methods: We developed a molecular diagnostic test to detect SARS-CoV-2. This methodology was transferred to research institutes, public hospitals and academic laboratories all around the country, creating a COVID-19 diagnostic lab network. Uruguay also implemented active epidemiological surveillance following the Test, Trace and Isolate (TETRIS) strategy coupled to real-time genomic epidemiology. Results: Three months after the first cases were detected, the number of positive individuals reached 826 (23 deaths, 112 active cases and 691 recovered). The Uruguayan strategy was based in a close synergy established between the national health authorities and the scientific community. In turn, academia rapidly responded to develop national RT-qPCR tests. Consequently, Uruguay was able to perform ~1,000 molecular tests per day in a matter of weeks. The COVID-19 diagnostic lab network performed more than 54% of the molecular tests in the country. This, together with real-time genomics, were instrumental to implement the TETRIS strategy, helping to contain domestic transmission of the main outbreaks registered so far. Conclusions: Uruguay has successfully navigated the first trimester of the COVID-19 health crisis in South America.

COVID‐19‐associated neutrophilia, increased neutrophil‐to‐lymphocyte ratio, aberrant neutrophil activation, and infiltration of neutrophils into lungs suggest that neutrophils are important players in the disease immunopathology. The main objective of this study was to assess the phenotypic and functional characteristics of neutrophils in COVID‐19 patients, with particular focus on the interaction between neutrophils and T cells. We hypothesize that the altered functional characteristics of COVID‐19 patient‐derived neutrophils result in skewed Th1/Th17 adaptive immune response, thus contributing to disease pathology. The expansion of G‐MDSC and immature forms of neutrophils was shown in the COVID‐19 patients. In the COVID‐19 neutrophil/T cell cocultures, neutrophils caused a strong polarity shift toward Th17, and, conversely, a reduction of IFNγ‐producing Th1 cells. The Th17 promotion was NOS dependent. Neutrophils, the known modulators of adaptive immunity, skew the polarization of T cells toward the Th17 promotion and Th1 suppression in COVID‐19 patients, contributing to the discoordinated orchestration of immune response against SARS‐CoV‐2. As IL‐17 and other Th17‐related cytokines have previously been shown to correlate with the disease severity, we suggest that targeting neutrophils and/or Th17 represents a potentially beneficial therapeutic strategy for severe COVID‐19 patients.","Parackova, Zuzana; Bloomfield, Marketa; Klocperk, Adam; Sediva, Anna",J Leukoc Biol,770,29

The primary intention is to assess the efficacy and safety of Galaxy and MicrusFrame coils (Cerenovus, Irvine, CA). The Covid pandemic has the potential to alter the delivery of medical care or trial enrollment. Changes to regional or hospital specific research infrastructure will likely affect trials for the worse. Methods A retrospective review of STERLING sites and patients was undertaken to better understand regional variation in adapting to the pandemic and how enrollment was affected. Results 45 global sites currently take part in the STERLING registry. 28 sites began enrolling pre-Covid. 34% of U.S. sites were required to halt research, enrollment or elective surgery, whereas only 8% of EU and none of the Japanese sites were required to significantly change their research protocols respectively. At the 10 (9 US, 1 EU) sites required to put a hold on research, rates of enrollment dropped from an average of 0.6 subjects/month in the US (0.5 in EU) to 0 in the first month and 0.1 subjects/month in the second month of Covid-related restrictions. At the time of this analysis (1/ 2021), the average rate of enrollment across those sites partially recovered to 0.2 subjects/month in the US and 0.2 in EU, although 5 of the 10 sites (all US) had not enrolled any subjects post Covid. Overall, mean actual vs. projected enrollment rates decreased more in the U.S. than in the EU and Japan. The percent of ruptured aneurysms in the per-protocol analysis increased from 23% to 40%, while the percent of unruptured aneurysms decreased from 76% to 60%. There were no significant changes to occlusion rates or adverse events pre/ post Covid. Conclusion The Covid pandemic has the potential to dramatically alter how research is conducted worldwide. U.S. sites faced tougher restrictions than their EU and Japan counterparts. Particularly within the U.S., moratoriums on research and elective surgery may be the driving factor in reducing overall enrollment and increasing the percentage of ruptured aneurysm enrollment. Fortunately, these changes did not appear to negatively affect occlusion rates or adverse events.","De Leacy, R.; Puri, A.; Starke, R.; Jankowitz, B.; Yoo, A.; Pero, G.; Chivot, C.; Yao, T.; Zaidat, O.",Journal of NeuroInterventional Surgery,770,16

Most of the existing studies are based on large and private annotated datasets that are impractical to obtain from a single institution, especially when radiologists are busy fighting the coronavirus disease. Furthermore, it is hard to compare current COVID-19 CT segmentation methods as they are developed on different datasets, trained in different settings, and evaluated with different metrics. Methods: To promote the development of data-efficient deep learning methods, in this paper, we built three benchmarks for lung and infection segmentation based on 70 annotated COVID-19 cases, which contain current active research areas, e.g., few-shot learning, domain generalization, and knowledge transfer. For a fair comparison among different segmentation methods, we also provide standard training, validation and testing splits, evaluation metrics and, the corresponding code. Results: Based on the state-of-the-art network, we provide more than 40 pre-trained baseline models, which not only serve as out-of-the-box segmentation tools but also save computational time for researchers who are interested in COVID-19 lung and infection segmentation. We achieve average Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) scores of 97.3\%, 97.7\%, and 67.3\% and average Normalized Surface Dice (NSD) scores of 90.6\%, 91.4\%, and 70.0\% for left lung, right lung, and infection, respectively. Conclusions: To the best of our knowledge, this work presents the first data-efficient learning benchmark for medical image segmentation and the largest number of pre-trained models up to now. All these resources are publicly available, and our work lays the foundation for promoting the development of deep learning methods for efficient COVID-19 CT segmentation with limited data.","Ma, Jun; Wang, Yixin; An, Xingle; Ge, Cheng; Yu, Ziqi; Chen, Jianan; Zhu, Qiongjie; Dong, Guoqiang; He, Jian; He, Zhiqiang; Zhu, Yuntao; Nie, Ziwei; Yang, Xiaoping",Medical physics,770,33

The aim of our study was to evaluate the immune response to COVID-19 vaccinations in breastfeeding women. Methods: The study included 32 breastfeeding women who, regardless of the study, had decided to be vaccinated. Maternal serum and breast milk samples were simultaneously collected on days 8 ± 1, 22 ± 2, 29 ± 3, and 43 ± 4 after the first dose of the vaccine. The immune response was assessed by determining the presence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgA. Results: The breast milk IgG level was detectable (6.50 ± 6.74, median 4.7, and maximum 34.2 BAU/mL) and highly correlated to serum IgG level (r(S) 0.89; p < 0.001). The breast milk ratio of IgA to the cut-off value was higher in serum IgA-positive (4.18 ± 3.26, median 2.8, and maximum >10) than in serum IgA-negative women (0.56 ± 0.37, median 0.5, and maximum 1.6; p < 0.001). The highest concentrations of serum and breast milk antibodies were observed on day 29 ± 3 with a decrease on day 43 ± 4. Conclusion: The immune response to the vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 is strongest 7 ± 3 days after the second dose of the vaccine. Lactating mothers breastfeeding their children after vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 may transfer antibodies to their infant.","Jakuszko, Katarzyna; Kościelska-Kasprzak, Katarzyna; Żabińska, Marcelina; Bartoszek, Dorota; Poznański, Paweł; Rukasz, Dagna; Kłak, Renata; Królak-Olejnik, Barbara; Krajewska, Magdalena",Vaccines (Basel),770,1

DESIGN: Prospective observational study. SETTING: Primary Care and Community. PARTICIPANTS: A-RGA and SA-RGA app were administered to older adults ≥ 60 years old from December 2020 to April 2021. MEASUREMENTS: The RGA app screens for frailty (FRAIL), sarcopenia (SARC-F), anorexia of aging (SNAQ) and cognition (Rapid Cognitive Screen) with assisted management pathway. Patient Health Questionnaire 9 is administered for those who score positive for fatigue. The diagnostic performance of SA-RGA was compared against A-RGA as a reference by calculating the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) and positive likelihood ratio (+LR). RESULTS: 123 participants with a mean age of 71 ± 5.9 years completed both the SA-RGA and A-RGA. Questions on fatigue, 5 or more illnesses, loss of weight and falls in the past year performed better with high sensitivity, specificity, NPV and +LR than self-functional assessment where SA-RGA participants reported lower prevalence on the FRAIL scale aerobic and resistance components, and higher prevalence on the SARC-F strength and rising from a chair components. CONCLUSION: The SA-RGA app performed well in certain domains such as assessment for weight loss, falls, number of chronic illness and fatigue. Self-functional assessment can be improved further by removing ambiguity in wordings such as “some” or “a lot” and replacing it with functional difficulty scale. SA-RGA has the potential to be incorporated in the eHEALTH platforms worldwide for early identifications of older adults at risk and to reduce health inequalities, at the same time building community resilience in the era of Covid-19 pandemic.","Tan, L.

We aimed to estimate the proportion of Syrian adult population intending to be vaccinated against COVID-19 and, principally, to assess the demographic and attitudinal factors associated with it in order to approach suitable solutions. METHODS: An anonymous online questionnaire was conducted between 23rd December 2020 and 5th January 2021 in various provinces in Syria. A total of 3402 adults were sampled to reflect the population demographic factors. Attitudinal factors included Covid-19 fears, risks, and beliefs on the origin. Vaccination hesitancy and knowledge were also measured. The intention to get vaccinated against COVID-19 was the primary endpoint. RESULTS: According to their statements, 1222 participants (35.92%) will consent to get vaccinated against COVID-19. Our findings indicate that male gender, younger age, rural residence, not having children, smoking, fear about COVID-19, individual perceived severity, believing in the natural origin of the coronavirus, and high vaccination knowledge were positive predictors of embracing COVID-19 vaccine when it is available. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 vaccine acceptance rate is considerably poor across Syrian population compared to populations in developed countries. Vaccine hesitancy is closely bound to the fear of side effects and doubts about vaccine efficacy. Factors such as conspiracy beliefs and myths about the vaccine lower vaccine uptake. Thus, interventional educational campaigns are increasingly required to overcome misinformation and avert low vaccination acceptance rates.","Mohamad, Okbah; Zamlout, Ali; AlKhoury, Naseem; Mazloum, Abd Aljawad; Alsalkini, Marah; Shaaban, Rafea",BMC Public Health,770,2

SNPs are located in coding or non-coding genomic regions and can affect gene expression or protein function by different mechanisms. Furthermore, they have been linked to multiple human diseases, highlighting their medical relevance. Therefore, the identification and analysis of this kind of polymorphisms in the human genome has gained high importance in the research community, and an increasing number of studies have been published during the last years. As a consequence of this exhaustive exploration, an association between the presence of some specific SNPs and the susceptibility or severity of many infectious diseases in some risk population groups has been found. In this review, we discuss the relevance of SNPs that are important to understand the pathology derived from influenza A virus (IAV) infections in humans and the susceptibility of some individuals to suffer more severe symptoms.

Time use studies, questionnaires, and telephone- and person-to-person interviews were used for assessing meal times in relation to commensality. Four of the studies used a method of time use registration, and six papers used interviews or questionnaires. Common meals with family members were the most common, and dinners late at night were often preferred for commensal activities among the working population. In conclusion, the family meal seemed to be the most important commensal meal.

METHODS: Descriptive and analytical observational retrospective study of all emergency consultations between March 1, 2020, and May 21, 2020, carried out by the Otorhinolaryngology–Head and Neck Surgery Department of a tertiary university hospital. The adequacy of consultations was assessed with the Hospital Emergency Suitability Protocol (HESP). The correlation between the emergencies and the SARS-CoV-2 confirmed cases was assessed with a generalized linear model. RESULTS: Although there was a decrease of almost 50% in ENT-ED visits during the first wave of COVID-19, the pattern of most cases remained similar to the pre-COVID-19 era: non-urgent consultations, not previously assessed by Primary Care (PC), being considered inadequate by the HESP. The three main reasons for consultation were otalgia, odynophagia, and epistaxis. The number of ENT-ED visits and the total number of confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 in the health area were correlated. CONCLUSIONS: SARS-CoV-2 pandemic was a challenge for the Spanish health system. The critical epidemiological situation experienced during March, April, and May explains the reduction in the number of visits to the ENT-ED. However, this condition did not affect the predominant pattern of visits with respect to the pre-COVID-19 era, which were mostly inadequate.

Previously, it was suggested that FLAV is unique among the rhabdoviruses in that it contains two pseudogenes located between the P and M genes, while the cognate sequence for HPV has been lacking. Herein, we demonstrate that FLAV and HPV do not contain pseudogenes in this region, but encode three small functional proteins designated as U1–U3 that apparently arose by gene duplication. To further investigate the U1–U3 region, we conducted the first large-scale evolutionary analysis of a member of the Hart Park serogroup by analyzing over 100 spatially and temporally distinct FLAV isolates. Our phylogeographic analysis demonstrates that although FLAV appears to be slowly evolving, phylogenetically divergent lineages co-circulate sympatrically.","Allison, Andrew B.; Mead, Daniel G.; Palacios, Gustavo F.; Tesh, Robert B.; Holmes, Edward C.",Virology,770,29

While the current focus is on limiting its transmission from direct contact with infected patients and surfaces during the pandemic, the secondary transmission potential via sewage should not be underestimated, especially in low-income and developing countries with weak wastewater treatment technologies. Recent studies have indicated SARS-CoV-2 positivity also be detected in the feces of patients. Therefore, the risk of transmission and infection can be increased into sewage by the fecal-oral way, mainly in some parts of the globe with a high amount of open defecation. This review collected scattered data and recent studies about the direct and indirect effects of coronavirus in the water cycle. The direct impacts of COVID-19 on wastewater are related to the presence of the coronavirus and suitable viral removal methods in different phases of treatment in wastewater treatment plants. The indirect effects of COVID-19 on wastewater are related to the overuse of cleaning and disinfecting products to protect against viral infection and the overuse of certain drugs to protect against virus or novel mental problems and panic to COVID-19 and consequently their presence in wastewater. This unexpected situation leads to changes in the quality of wastewater and brings adverse and harmful effects for the human, aquatic organisms, and the environment. Therefore, applying effective wastewater treatment technologies with low toxic by-products in wastewater treatment plants will be helpful to prevent the increasing occurrence of these extra contaminants in the environment.","Teymoorian, Termeh; Teymourian, Targol; Kowsari, Elaheh; Ramakrishna, Seeram",,770,1

We hypothesized that comprehensive national data on ICU resources would permit a better understanding of regional differences in system capacity. METHODS: After the 2009–2010 Influenza A (H1N1) pandemic, the Canadian Critical Care Trials Group surveyed all acute care hospitals in Canada to assess ICU capacity. Using a structured survey tool administered to physicians, respiratory therapists and nurses, we determined the number of ICU beds, ventilators, and the ability to provide specialized support for respiratory failure. RESULTS: We identified 286 hospitals with 3170 ICU beds and 4982 mechanical ventilators for critically ill patients. Twenty-two hospitals had an ICU that routinely cared for children; 15 had dedicated pediatric ICUs. Per 100,000 population, there was substantial variability in provincial capacity, with a mean of 0.9 hospitals with ICUs (provincial range 0.4-2.8), 10 ICU beds capable of providing mechanical ventilation (provincial range 6–19), and 15 invasive mechanical ventilators (provincial range 10–24). There was only moderate correlation between ventilation capacity and population size (coefficient of determination (R(2)) = 0.771). CONCLUSION: ICU resources vary widely across Canadian provinces, and during times of increased demand, may result in geographic differences in the ability to care for critically ill patients. These results highlight the need to evolve inter-jurisdictional resource sharing during periods of substantial increase in demand, and provide background data for the development of appropriate critical care capacity benchmarks.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: An online survey comprising of 51 opinion and socio-economic questions, divided into 9 sections of different topics, which was administered between the members of 13 professional associations. Chi-squared tests were calculated (p<0.05). RESULTS: Valid responses were received from 422 participants with a mean age of 41 years old and 66% of female dentists. Most dentists considered their selves in a “good” position, however, 72.3% of them said the profession “has had worsened”. Opinions significantly differed between women and men in gender equity and the pay gap between them could be observed (29.4% of males earned more of 4000 euros a month, while only 15.1% female dentists did). Also, 49.5% of female dentists felt underrepresented in the highest association of Spanish dentists (General Council of Dentist - Consejo General de Dentistas) and 38.4% declared they have had suffered verbal violence coming from patients repeatedly.

There are currently over one thousand CBD products available globally, ranging from oil extracts to CBD-infused beverages. Despite increased usage and availability, the evidence supporting the medical efficacy of CBD is limited. Anecdotal evidence suggests CBD sellers represent their products for medical use through direct medical claims or advice, which in Canada, is not allowed under the Cannabis Act without Health Canada approval. However, it is not clear the extent of sellers making health claims or other strategies used to promote medical usage of CBD. The objective of this study is to determine how CBD sellers advertise their products online to consumers. METHODS: The product descriptions of 2165 CBD products from 70 websites selling CBD products for human consumption in Canada were collected from January 14th(,) 2020 to February 2nd(,) 2020 using an automated website scraper tool. A framing analysis was used to determine how CBD sellers frame their products to prospective customers. The specific medical conditions CBD is represented to treat and product forms were tabulated. RESULTS: CBD products are framed to prospective customer through three distinct frames: a specific cure or treatment (n = 1153), a natural health product (n = 872), and a product used in certain ways to achieve particular results (n = 1388). Product descriptions contained medical or therapeutic claims for 171 medical conditions and ailments, with 53.3% of products containing at least one claim. The most prevalent claims found in product descriptions were the ability to treat or manage pain (n = 824), anxiety (n = 609), and inflammation (n = 545). Claims were found for treating or managing serious and-life-threatening illnesses such as multiple sclerosis (n = 210), arthritis (n = 179), cancer (n = 169), Crohn’s disease (n = 78), Parkinson’s disease (n = 59), and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) (n = 54). CBD most often came in oil/tincture/concentrate form (n = 755), followed by edibles (n = 428), and vaporizer pen/cartridge/liquid products (n = 290). CONCLUSION: The findings suggest CBD is represented as a medical option for numerous conditions and ailments. We recommend Health Canada to conduct a systematic audit of companies selling CBD for regulatory adherence.","Zenone, Marco Antonio; Snyder, Jeremy; Crooks, Valorie",BMC Public Health,770,1

It enters by binding with ACE2 receptor present on the outer surface of a cell by cleaving S1/S2 with proteolytic protein Furin. Further viral replication or transcription then takes place with the help of main protease 3CLpro and polymerase RdRp. This in silco study was carried out to block ACE2, Furin, 3CLpro and RdRP with various phytochemicals to prevent SARS- CoV-2 entry and replication or transcription. Twenty different phytochemicals were screened to understand the drug-likeliness obeying Lipinski’s rule 5 and further, molecular docking was performed using these phytochemicals to block their respective target proteins. All the phytochemicals follow Lipinski’s rule of five and molecular docking result shows best binding affinity of Podofilox − 7.54 kcal/mol with ACE2, Psoralidin − 8.04 kcal/mol with Furin, Ursolic acid − 8.88 kcal/mol with 3CLpro and Epiafzelechin − 8.26 kcal/mol with RdRp. Thus, blocking two human receptors ACE2 and Furin with Podofilox and Psoralidin respectively may prevent the viral entry into the cells. Also blocking viral proteins 3CLpro and RdRp with Ursolic acid and Epiafzelechin may prevent viral replication or transcription. Using this combination therapy of blocking the receptors responsible for viral entry and viral proteins responsible for replication or transcription may prevent SARS- CoV-2 infection.","Dey, Dipjyoti; Dey, Nirban; Ghosh, Shalini; Chandrasekaran, Natrajan; Mukherjee, Amitava; Thomas, John",Virusdisease,770,26

Most research has been focused on isolation, genome sequencing, pathogenicity, and virulence of these viruses, but there is little information on long-term growth performance and tissue accretion of pigs inoculated with PEDV or PDCoV. Therefore, our objective was to determine the effect of PEDV or PDCoV infection on growth performance and tissue accretion over 42 d following inoculation. A total of 75 Choice Genetics Large White Pureline barrows and gilts (BW = 10.81 ± 0.81 kg) at approximately 2 wk post-wean and naïve for PEDV and PDCoV were selected. Pigs were allotted based on BW and sex, stratified across 3 treatments with 8 pens per treatment. Treatments were: 1) Control (n = 8); 2) PEDV inoculated (n = 8); and 3) PDCoV inoculated (n = 8). On day post inoculation (dpi) 2, 5, 7, and 14 pigs were euthanized for tissue collection and analyses from these tissues are discussed elsewhere. Pen feed intake and BW were recorded on dpi 2, 5, 7, and weekly thereafter until dpi 42. On 1 designated pig per pen, initial and final body composition was determined using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) and tissue accretion rates were calculated over 6 wk test period. Peak PEDV infection was noted at 3 dpi compared with 4 dpi for PDCoV pigs as determined by fecal swab quantitative real-time PCR (RT-PCR). Control pigs remained negative for PEDV and PDCoV throughout the experiment. Overall, Control and PDCoV pigs did not differ in ADG, ADFI or G:F (P > 0.05). Compared to Control and PDCoV pigs, the overall 42 d ADFI was reduced in the challenged PEDV pigs (P < 0.05) by 19 and 27%, respectively. PEDV did not significantly reduce the overall ADG or G:F compared with Control and PDCoV pigs; however, the biggest reduction in ADG and ADFI for PEDV pigs was within 14 dpi compared to the Control pigs (P < 0.05). Whole body tissue accretion was altered due to PED, with fat, lean, protein, and bone mineral accretion reductions by 24, 20, 21, and 42%, respectively (P < 0.05) compared with Control pigs. Overall, nursery pig performance was greatly impacted by PEDV challenge. Surprisingly, the PDCoV challenge did not negatively influence nursery pig performance.

Infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) presents with upper respiratory symptoms like cough, fever, and lethargy. At the same time, in later stages, critical COVID-19 patients develop acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), venous thromboembolism (VTE), and multiple organ failure from cytokine storm and coagulation hyperactivity. Primary manifestations of thrombotic events include deep vein thrombosis (DVT), disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) and pulmonary embolism (PE). Initial coagulopathy in COVID-19 patients presents with elevated fibrin degradation products, especially D-dimers. In contrast, late presentations show evidence of prolonged prothrombin time (PT) and activated partial thromboplastin (aPTT), increased platelets, and fibrinogen levels. Diagnosis and monitoring of disease progression are done by regular screening of laboratory parameters, including D-dimer and fibrinogen. Management of coagulopathy in COVID-19 patients is like that of critically ill patients, including thromboprophylaxis. Coagulopathy is a poor prognostic factor, and optimum strategies should be developed for early diagnosis, prevention, and prompt treatment of VTE in COVID-19 patients. Thrombosis prophylaxis with low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) has shown beneficial results in preventing coagulopathy a reducing risk of mortality due to thrombotic events.

A seroepidemiological study has shown that almost all the children have antibodies to HBoV by the age of five years, and HBoV infection seems to be rare in adults. HBoV is often detected in association with other respiratory viruses. This virus has also been detected in stools, but its role in gastroenteritis has not been yet established. Virological diagnostic of HBoV infection is based on the detection of viral DNA by PCR.

Although its genome sequence has previously been published and molecular biology methods have been used to study this species, no suitable internal reference genes have been investigated for standardization of gene expression via quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Here, the stabilities of 10 candidate reference genes, ACT11, ACT7, α-TUB, β-TUB, GAPDH, UBC, RPL, SAM, HSP70, and PP2A, were analyzed by four different procedures of GeNorm, NormFinder, BestKeeper, and RefFinder. Their expression stabilities were evaluated under various conditions, including different tissue types (root, stem, leaf, and flower), hormone stimuli treatments (methyl jasmonate, salicylic acid, and abscisic acid), and abiotic stresses (heavy metal, salt, drought, cold, and wounding). The results indicated that β-TUB was the most stable gene for all tested samples, while ACT11 was the most unstable. The most stable reference gene was not consistent under different conditions. β-TUB exhibited the highest stability for different tissue types and abiotic stresses, while for hormone stimuli treatments, ACT7 showed the highest stability. To confirm the applicability of suitable reference genes, we selected to SbF6H and SbF8H as target genes to analyze their expression levels in different tissues.

During this pathway, BAs are modified in their molecular structure by the action of enzymes and bacteria. Such transformations allow them to acquire the chemical–physical properties needed for fulling several activities including metabolic regulation, antimicrobial functions and solubilization of lipids in digestion. The versatility of BAs in the physiological functions has inspired their use in many bio-applications, making them important tools for active molecule delivery, metabolic disease treatments and emulsification processes in food and drug industries. Moreover, moving over the borders of the biological field, BAs have been largely investigated as building blocks for the construction of supramolecular aggregates having peculiar structural, mechanical, chemical and optical properties.

This cross-reactivity is sometimes predictable, such as between lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) and Pichinde virus, where cross-reactive epitopes share six out of eight amino acids. Here, however, we demonstrate more subtle and less predictable cross-reactivity between LCMV and the unrelated vaccinia virus (VV). Epitope-specific T cell receptor usage differed between individual LCMV-infected C57BL/6 mice, even though the mice had similar epitope-specific T cell hierarchies. LCMV-immune mice challenged with VV showed variations, albeit in a distinct hierarchy, in proliferative expansions of and down-regulation of IL-7Rα by T cells specific to different LCMV epitopes. T cell responses to a VV-encoded epitope that is cross-reactive with LCMV fluctuated greatly in VV-infected LCMV-immune mice. Adoptive transfers of splenocytes from individual LCMV-immune donors resulted in nearly identical VV-induced responses in each of several recipients, but responses differed depending on the donor. This indicates that the specificities of T cell responses that are not shared between individuals may influence cross-reactivity with other antigens and play roles in heterologous immunity upon encounter with another pathogen. This variability in cross-reactive T cell expansion that is unique to the individual may underlie variation in the pathogenesis of infectious diseases.","Kim, Sung-Kwon; Cornberg, Markus; Wang, Xiaoting Z.; Chen, Hong D.; Selin, Liisa K.; Welsh, Raymond M.",J Exp Med,770,16

Random effects meta-regression was used to compute pooled odds ratios for mortality adjusted for imbalance in age, sex and prevalence of cardiovascular disease, hypertension, diabetes mellitus and chronic kidney disease between users and non-users of ARBs/ACE inhibitors at the study-level during data synthesis. RESULTS In 30 included studies of 17,281 patients, 22%, 68%, 25%, and 11% had cardiovascular disease, hypertension, diabetes mellitus and chronic kidney disease. ARBs/ACE inhibitors use was associated with significantly lower mortality after controlling for potential confounding factors (OR 0.77 (95% CI: 0.62, 0.96)). In contrast, meta-analysis of ARBs/ACE inhibitors use was not significantly associated with mortality when all studies were combined with no confounder adjustment performed (0.87 (95% CI: 0.71, 1.08)). CONCLUSIONS ARBs/ACE inhibitors use was associated with decreased mortality in cohorts of COVID-19 patients after adjusting for age, sex, cardiovascular disease, hypertension, diabetes and chronic kidney disease.

Design: This descriptive ecological observational study Setting: 224 cantons (geographical area) of Ecuador with secondary data sources of hospital information. Participants: The unit of measurement was 224 cantons of Ecuador, in which analysed morbidity and lethality rates for SARI using hospital release data (2016-2018). Main measurements: Eight sociodemographic indicators were structuralized, and correlation tests applied for a multiple regression model. The priorization index was created with criteria of efficiency, efficacy, effect size (IRR) and equity. Using the sum of the index for each indicator, the priorization score was calculated and localized in a territorial map. Results: Morbidity associated factors where: school attendance years, urbanization and population density; for mortality resulted: school attendance and ethnics (indigenous) IRR: 1.09 (IC95%:1.06-1.15) and IRR: 1.024 (IC95%:1.02-1.03) respectively. With lethality where related cantons, with population older than 60 years, IRR: 1.049 (IC95%: 1.03-1.07); 87 cantons had high priority mostly localized in the mountain region and the Morona Santiago Province. Conclusions: Morbidity and mortality of SARI in Ecuador are associated to social and demographic factors.

There are many dermatologic conditions which a primary care provider (PCP) should be able to recognize and manage. One such condition is granuloma annulare (GA), which commonly presents as smooth, annular plaques on the trunk and/or extremities. Rashes like GA rarely present as unique variants and may be difficult for PCPs to determine from patient history and physical exam alone. Patch granuloma annulare (patch GA) is an example that may clinically mimic a cutaneous lymphoma known as mycosis fungoides (MF). PCPs should ideally be able to recognize the utility of performing a skin biopsy and/or referring the patient to a dermatologist when history and physical exam alone are insufficient. The histologic findings of skin biopsies often become essential in establishing a proper diagnosis and guiding patient management in unique dermatologic variants. EXAMPLE CASE: The patient in this clinical practice report is a Caucasian female in her late 60s who presented to a dermatology clinic with a two-year history of a worsening widespread eruption on her trunk and extremities. She had been evaluated previously by her PCP about 4 months prior and, without obtaining skin biopsies, treated her with a medium potency topical corticosteroid cream. The eruption had spread over her hips, buttocks, back, thighs, wrists, and elbows. Multiple skin biopsies of affected sites were taken by the second author and revealed findings consistent with patch GA. The patient was started on topical betamethasone dipropionate 0.05% ointment twice daily and noted marked improvement of her symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Although GA is a benign condition of the skin that may be readily detected by PCPs, skin biopsies may be necessary to establish a proper diagnosis when this condition presents as a unique variant (e.g., patch GA). Therapy for patch GA often begins with a trial of high-potency topical steroid therapy in combination with ultraviolet light exposure, depending on disease severity and patient preference. Early evaluation with a skin biopsy by her PCP or an earlier referral to a dermatologist to have skin biopsies performed likely would have helped establish a prompter diagnosis and treatment plan for this patient.","Schukow, Casey P.; Schaeffer, Madeline; Boss, Katherine; Fivenson, David",Spartan medical research journal,770,30

Exploring factors that may heighten or buffer the risk of mental health problems in this context is thus critical. Whilst compassion may be a protective factor, in contrast fears of compassion increase vulnerability to psychosocial distress and may amplify the impact of the pandemic on mental health. This study explores the magnifying effects of fears of compassion on the impact of perceived threat of COVID‐19 on depression, anxiety and stress, and social safeness. METHODS: Adult participants from the general population (N = 4057) were recruited across 21 countries worldwide, and completed self‐report measures of perceived threat of COVID‐19, fears of compassion (for self, from others, for others), depression, anxiety, stress and social safeness. RESULTS: Perceived threat of COVID‐19 predicted increased depression, anxiety and stress. The three flows of fears of compassion predicted higher levels of depression, anxiety and stress and lower social safeness. All fears of compassion moderated (heightened) the impact of perceived threat of COVID‐19 on psychological distress. Only fears of compassion from others moderated the effects of likelihood of contracting COVID‐19 on social safeness. These effects were consistent across all countries. CONCLUSIONS: Fears of compassion have a universal magnifying effect on the damaging impact of the COVID‐19 pandemic on mental health and social safeness. Compassion focused interventions and communications could be implemented to reduce resistances to compassion and promote mental wellbeing during and following the pandemic.","Matos, Marcela; McEwan, Kirsten; Kanovský, Martin; Halamová, Júlia; Steindl, Stanley R.; Ferreira, Nuno; Linharelhos, Mariana; Rijo, Daniel; Asano, Kenichi; Gregório, Sónia; Márquez, Margarita G.; Vilas, Sara P.; Brito‐Pons, Gonzalo; Lucena‐Santos, Paola; da Silva Oliveira, Margareth; de Souza, Erika Leonardo; Llobenes, Lorena; Gumiy, Natali; Costa, Maria Ileana; Habib, Noor; Hakem, Reham; Khrad, Hussain; Alzahrani, Ahmad; Cheli, Simone; Petrocchi, Nicola; Tholouli, Elli; Issari, Philia; Simos, Gregoris; Lunding‐Gregersen, Vibeke; Elklit, Ask; Kolts, Russell; Kelly, Allison C.; Bortolon, Catherine; Delamillieure, Pascal; Paucsik, Marine; Wahl, Julia E.; Zieba, Mariusz; Zatorski, Mateusz; Komendziński, Tomasz; Zhang, Shuge; Basran, Jaskaran; Kagialis, Antonios; Kirby, James; Gilbert, Paul",Clin Psychol Psychother,770,20

Excess mortality analysis is suggested as a useful tool in estimating the impact of the disease. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Mortality data between January 01 and May 18, 2020, were analyzed to evaluate the excess mortality owing to COVID-19 in Istanbul, the city most affected by the pandemic in Turkey. The average weekly percentage changes in the number of deaths in 4 previous years were compared with those in the year 2020 using excess mortality analysis. RESULTS: The number of deaths in Istanbul was significantly higher in 2020 (p=0.001), with a 10% weekly increase between the 10th and 15th weeks, which started to decrease until the 20th week. The excess mortality found during the study period was 4,084 deaths, higher than the officially reported COVID-19 mortality. CONCLUSION: Our findings demonstrated that mortality owing to COVID-19 could be higher than the official figures reported by health authorities.","Musellim, Benan; Kul, Seval; Ay, Pinar; Küçük, Filiz Çagla Uyanusta; Dagli, Elif; Itil, Oya; Bayram, Hasan",Turk Thorac J,770,24

From 2006 to 2020, the incidence of deep vein thrombosis (DVT), pulmonary embolism (PE), and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) tended to increase. Unlike intracranial venous thrombosis (ICVT) and intracranial thrombophlebitis (ICTP), which showed no age difference, other venous embolism, and thrombosis (OVET), DIC, DVT, and PE were significantly more common in over 65 years. The overall 2-week incidence of ICVT was 0.21/1,000,000 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.11–0.32). ICTP, OVET, DIC, DVT and PE were expected to occur in 0.08 (95% CI, 0.02–0.14), 7.66 (95% CI, 6.08–9.23), 5.95 (95% CI, 4.88–7.03), 13.28 (95% CI, 11.92–14.64), 14.09 (95% CI, 12.80–15.37) per 1,000,000, respectively.

We aimed to develop and evaluate an artificial intelligence system using chest x-rays and clinical data to predict disease severity and progression in patients with COVID-19. METHODS: We did a retrospective study in multiple hospitals in the University of Pennsylvania Health System in Philadelphia, PA, USA, and Brown University affiliated hospitals in Providence, RI, USA. Patients who presented to a hospital in the University of Pennsylvania Health System via the emergency department, with a diagnosis of COVID-19 confirmed by RT-PCR and with an available chest x-ray from their initial presentation or admission, were retrospectively identified and randomly divided into training, validation, and test sets (7:1:2). Using the chest x-rays as input to an EfficientNet deep neural network and clinical data, models were trained to predict the binary outcome of disease severity (ie, critical or non-critical). The deep-learning features extracted from the model and clinical data were used to build time-to-event models to predict the risk of disease progression. The models were externally tested on patients who presented to an independent multicentre institution, Brown University affiliated hospitals, and compared with severity scores provided by radiologists. FINDINGS: 1834 patients who presented via the University of Pennsylvania Health System between March 9 and July 20, 2020, were identified and assigned to the model training (n=1285), validation (n=183), or testing (n=366) sets. 475 patients who presented via the Brown University affiliated hospitals between March 1 and July 18, 2020, were identified for external testing of the models. When chest x-rays were added to clinical data for severity prediction, area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC-AUC) increased from 0·821 (95% CI 0·796–0·828) to 0·846 (0·815–0·852; p<0·0001) on internal testing and 0·731 (0·712–0·738) to 0·792 (0·780–0 ·803; p<0·0001) on external testing. When deep-learning features were added to clinical data for progression prediction, the concordance index (C-index) increased from 0·769 (0·755–0·786) to 0·805 (0·800–0·820; p<0·0001) on internal testing and 0·707 (0·695–0·729) to 0·752 (0·739–0·764; p<0·0001) on external testing. The image and clinical data combined model had significantly better prognostic performance than combined severity scores and clinical data on internal testing (C-index 0·805 vs 0·781; p=0·0002) and external testing (C-inde 0·752 vs 0·715; p<0·0001). INTERPRETATION: In patients with COVID-19, artificial intelligence based on chest x-rays had better prognostic performance than clinical data or radiologist-derived severity scores. Using artificial intelligence, chest x-rays can augment clinical data in predicting the risk of progression to critical illness in patients with COVID-19.

We report the clinical, virological and serological findings in dogs experimentally infected with strain CB/05. The dogs, three 2.5-month-old and two 6-month-old pups, were successfully infected, shedding viral RNA with their faeces for the entire observation period (21 days) and displaying systemic clinical signs resembling those observed during the course of natural infection. Leucopenia (acute lymphopenia) occurred in all infected dogs, with values dropping below 60% of the initial counts. Considering the severity of the CB/05-induced disease, two of the youngest pups were euthanized for ethical reasons at days 8–9 postinfection, whereas the other pups underwent a slow but progressive improvement of their clinical status with complete recovery. At postmortem examination, remarkable lesions were observed in the internal organs of the euthanized pups, that tested positive for CCoV by real-time RT-PCR and virus isolation on cell cultures. All pups seroconverted for CCoV, as shown by the high optical density values and antibody titres detected by ELISA and virusneutralisation tests, respectively. The present study confirms that strain CB/05 is highly pathogenic for dogs, being able to induce a severe disease (and in some cases the death) even in experimental conditions.","Decaro, Nicola; Campolo, Marco; Lorusso, Alessio; Desario, Costantina; Mari, Viviana; Colaianni, Maria Loredana; Elia, Gabriella; Martella, Vito; Buonavoglia, Canio",Vet Microbiol,770,1

Objective Our objectives were 1) to compare the URT microbiome between SARS-CoV-2-infected and -uninfected adults, and 2) to examine the association of SARS-CoV-2 viral load with the URT microbiome during COVID-19. Methods We characterized the URT microbiome using 16S ribosomal RNA sequencing in 59 adults (38 with confirmed, symptomatic, mild-to-moderate COVID-19 and 21 asymptomatic, uninfected controls). In those with COVID-19, we measured SARS-CoV-2 viral load using quantitative reverse transcription PCR. We then examined the association of SARS-CoV-2 infection status and its viral load with the ⍺-diversity, β-diversity, and abundance of bacterial taxa of the URT microbiome. Our main models were all adjusted for age and sex. Results The observed species index was significantly higher in SARS-CoV-2-infected than in -uninfected adults (β linear regression coefficient=7.53, 95%CI=0.17-14.89, p=0.045). In differential abundance testing, 9 amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) were significantly different in both of our comparisons, with Peptoniphilus lacrimalis, Campylobacter hominis, Prevotella 9 copri, and an Anaerococcus unclassified ASV being more abundant in those with SARS-CoV-2 infection and in those with high viral load during COVID-19, whereas Corynebacterium unclassified, Staphylococcus haemolyticus, Prevotella disiens, and 2 Corynebacterium_1 unclassified ASVs were more abundant in those without SARS-CoV-2 infection and in those with low viral load during COVID-19. Conclusion Our findings suggest complex associations between SARS-CoV-2 and the URT microbiome in adults. Future studies are needed to examine how these viral-bacterial interactions can impact the clinical progression, severity, and recovery of COVID-19.","Rosas-Salazar, Christian; Kimura, Kyle S.; Shilts, Meghan H.; Strickland, Britton A.; Freeman, Michael H.; Wessinger, Bronson C.; Gupta, Veerain; Brown, Hunter M.; Rajagopala, Seesandra V.; Turner, Justin H.; Das, Suman R.",J Allergy Clin Immunol,770,16

Risks include virus exposures, extra working hours, psychological stressors, fatigue, work burnout, stigma, and physical and psychological violence. However, attention is needed to prepare the midwives during this crisis and help them overcome their challenges. The current study aims to explore Jordanian midwives’ experiences of providing health care during the COVID-19 pandemic crisis METHODS: A descriptive phenomenological qualitative study was used. Semi-structured interviews using telephone calls were conducted to collect data from April to May 2020. Each interview lasted for 30-45 minutes. Purposive and snowball sampling strategies were used to recruit 20 midwives from two hospitals. Colaizzi’s method was used to analyze the data manually RESULTS: Four main themes and eight subthemes were obtained. The main themes included: “Living in turmoil”; “Communication dilemma”; “Positive experience over time”, and “Seeking support”. CONCLUSION: Jordanian midwives experienced a stressful and interruptive routine life while providing care to their clients during the COVID-19 pandemic. This study recommends more attention towards the psychological state and factors that might affect the midwives during this crisis. The management and administrative teams should do their best to reduce the work pressure and arrange holidays appropriately. Policymakers and the government should provide the midwives with a safe work environment, good information resources, and financial rewards.","Alnuaimi, Karimeh",Int J Community Based Nurs Midwifery,770,28

METHODS: Using 16 years of nationally representative hospital-level data from the American Hospital Association (AHA) annual survey, we employed a difference-in-difference design to compare changes in productive hours per patient day for registered nurses (RNs), licensed practical/vocational nurses (LPNs), and nursing assistive personnel (NAP) in the state that mandated staffing ratios, states that legislated staffing committees, and states that legislated public reporting, to changes in states that did not implement any nurse staffing legislation before and after the legislation was implemented. We constructed multivariate linear regression models to assess the effects with hospital and year fixed effects, controlling for hospital-level characteristics and state-level factors. RESULTS: Compared with states with no legislation, the state that legislated minimum staffing ratios had an 0.996 (P<0.01) increase in RN hours per patient day and 0.224 (P<0.01) increase in NAP hours after the legislation was implemented, but no statistically significant changes in RN or NAP hours were found in states that legislated a staffing committee or public reporting. The staffing committee approach had a negative effect on LPN hours (difference-in-difference=−0.076, P<0.01), while the public reporting approach had a positive effect on LPN hours (difference-in-difference=0.115, P<0.01). There was no statistically significant effect of staffing mandate on LPN hours. CONCLUSIONS: When we included California in the comparison, our model suggests that neither the staffing committee nor the public reporting approach alone are effective in increasing hospital RN staffing, although the public reporting approach appeared to have a positive effect on LPN staffing. When we excluded California form the model, public reporting also had a positive effect on RN staffing. Future research should examine patient outcomes associated with these policies, as well as potential cost savings for hospitals from reduced nurse turnover rates.","Han, Xinxin; Pittman, Patricia; Barnow, Burt",Med Care,770,26

Their adoption provides clinicians with a central location to access and share data, write notes, order labs and prescriptions, and bill for patient visits. However, as non-clinical requirements have increased, time spent using EHRs eclipsed time spent on direct patient care. Several solutions have been proposed to minimize the time spent using EHRs, though each have limitations. Digital scribe technology uses voice-to-text software to convert ambient listening to meaningful medical notes and may eliminate the physical task of documentation, allowing physicians to spend less time on EHR engagement and more time with patients. However, adoption of digital scribe technology poses many barriers for physicians. In this study, we perform a scoping review of the literature to identify barriers to digital scribe implementation and provide solutions to address these barriers. We performed a literature review of digital scribe technology and voice-to-text conversion and information extraction as a scope for future research. Fifteen articles met inclusion criteria. Of the articles included, four were comparative studies, three were reviews, three were original investigations, two were perspective pieces, one was a cost-effectiveness study, one was a keynote address, and one was an observational study. The published articles on digital scribe technology and voice-to-text conversion highlight digital scribe technology as a solution to the inefficient interaction with EHRs. Benefits of digital scribe technologies included enhancing clinician ability to navigate charts, write notes, use decision support tools, and improve the quality of time spent with patients. Digital scribe technologies can improve clinic efficiency and increase patient access to care while simultaneously reducing physician burnout. Implementation barriers include upfront costs, integration with existing technology, and time-intensive training. Technological barriers include adaptability to linguistic differences, compatibility across different clinical encounters, and integration of medical jargon into the note. Broader risks include automation bias and risks to data privacy. Overcoming significant barriers to implementation will facilitate more widespread adoption.

Starting from the well-known “pandemic effect” on sleep and dreaming, we presented a picture of dream activity in pharmacologically treated NT1 patients during the Italian lockdown. Forty-three NT1 patients completed a web-survey during Spring 2021 and were compared with 86 matched-controls. Statistical comparisons revealed that: (a) NT1 patients showed greater sleepiness than controls; (b) controls showed higher sleep disturbances than NT1 patients, and this result disappeared when the medication effect in NT1 was controlled; (c) NT1 patients reported higher lucid dream frequency than controls. Focusing on dreaming in NT1 patients, we found that (a) nightmare frequency was correlated with female gender, longer sleep duration, higher intrasleep wakefulness; (b) dream recall, nightmare and lucid dream frequency were positively correlated with sleepiness. Comparisons between low and high NT1 lucid dreamers showed that patients more frequently experiencing lucid dreams reported a greater influence of dreaming during wakefulness, especially concerning problem-solving and creativity. Overall, our results are consistent with previous studies on pandemic dreaming carried out on healthy subjects. Moreover, we confirmed a link between lucidity and creativity in NT1 patients. Considering the small sample size and the cross-sectional design, our findings cannot provide a causal relationship between lucid dreams and the COVID-19 lockdown. Nevertheless, they represent a first contribution to address future studies on this issue, suggesting that some stable characteristics could interact with changes provoked by the pandemic.","Scarpelli, Serena; Alfonsi, Valentina; D'Anselmo, Anita; Gorgoni, Maurizio; Musetti, Alessandro; Plazzi, Giuseppe; De Gennaro, Luigi; Franceschini, Christian",Front Psychol,770,33

Longitudinal and repeated cross-sectional data were collected from online surveys distributed in April, between July and August, and December 2020. Australian adults who were ≥18 years old were recruited through email lists, social media networks, and paid Facebook advertisement. Willingness to vaccinate against COVID-19 was self-reported. The results showed that participants were more willing to vaccinate if the vaccine was safe at survey 1 (longitudinal: adjusted OR (aOR) = 1.88, 95%CI = 1.38, 2.56; cross-sectional: aOR = 3.73, 95%CI = 2.55, 5.45) and survey 2 (longitudinal: aOR = 1.54, 95%CI = 1.19, 2.00; cross-sectional: aOR = 2.48, 1.67, 3.67), compared to survey 3. The change in willingness to vaccinate if the vaccine was safe and effective was not significant for those in Metropolitan Victoria; but was for those living in other Australian locations at survey 1 (OR = 2.13, 95%CI = 1.64, 2.76) and survey 2 (OR = 1.62, 95%CI = 1.30, 2.01), compared to survey 3. Willingness to vaccinate even if a vaccine had not been proven safe decreased at survey 3 (OR = 2.02, 95%CI = 1.14, 3.57) for those living in Metropolitan Victoria. In conclusion willingness to vaccinate against COVID-19 decreased over time among Australians, except for those living in metropolitan Victoria, where an additional strict and prolonged lockdown was implemented around the time of survey 2. Either the experience of the lockdown, or the presence of the COVID-19 virus itself had a positive influence on participants’ willingness to vaccinate, even if such a vaccine was not yet proven to be safe and effective.","To, Quyen G.; Stanton, Robert; Khalesi, Saman; Williams, Susan L.; Alley, Stephanie J.; Thwaite, Tanya L.; Fenning, Andrew S.; Vandelanotte, Corneel",Vaccines (Basel),770,27

As the markers of lung injury, the correlation of Krebs von den Lungen-6 (KL-6) and fibronectin (Fn) with pulmonary fibrosis in COVID-19 was still unclear. METHODS: 113 patients diagnosed as COVID-19 were enrolled in this retrospective study, and divided into three categories as mild, moderate and severe cases. The concentrations of serum KL-6 and Fn at hospital admission were tested using the method of latex agglutination assay and immunoturbidimetic assay, respectively. RESULTS: Compared with that in the non-severe COVID-19 cases and normal control subjects, serum KL-6 concentration on admission was significantly higher in the severe group, which was positively correlated with C-reactive protein, and negatively correlated with lymphocytes count. Whereas, no obvious elevation in serum Fn concentration was investigated in COVID-19 patients with the different phenotypes. The severe cases displayed the higher incident rate of pulmonary fibrosis at hospital discharge. Compared with non-PF patients, the COVID-19 cases with PF had the higher serum KL-6 values. CONCLUSION: Serum KL-6 concentration was significantly elevated in severe COVID-19 patients, which may be useful for evaluating the disease severity. For early prevention of the development of pulmonary fibrosis, high concentrations of serum KL-6 in the early stage of COVID-19 should be paid close attention.","Peng, Ding-Hui; Luo, Yi; Huang, Li-Jun; Liao, Fan-Lu; Liu, Yan-Yuan; Tang, Peng; Hu, Han-Ning; Chen, Wei",Clin Chim Acta,770,10

In this study, we examine the disease potential for SARS-like CoVs currently circulating in Chinese horseshoe bat populations. Utilizing the SARS-CoV infectious clone, we generated and characterized a chimeric virus expressing the spike of bat coronavirus SHC014 in a mouse adapted SARS-CoV backbone. The results indicate that group 2b viruses encoding the SHC014 spike in a wild type backbone can efficiently utilize multiple ACE2 receptor orthologs, replicate efficiently in primary human airway cells, and achieve in vitro titers equivalent to epidemic strains of SARS-CoV. Additionally, in vivo experiments demonstrate replication of the chimeric virus in mouse lung with notable pathogenesis. Evaluation of available SARS-based immune-therapeutic and prophylactic modalities revealed poor efficacy; both monoclonal antibody and vaccine approaches failed to neutralize and protect from CoVs utilizing the novel spike protein. Importantly, based on these findings, we synthetically rederived an infectious full length SHC014 recombinant virus and demonstrate robust viral replication both in vitro and in vivo. Together, the work highlights a continued risk of SARS-CoV reemergence from viruses currently circulating in bat populations.","Menachery, Vineet D.; Yount, Boyd L.; Debbink, Kari; Agnihothram, Sudhakar; Gralinski, Lisa E.; Plante, Jessica A.; Graham, Rachel L.; Scobey, Trevor; Ge, Xing-Yi; Donaldson, Eric F.; Randell, Scott H.; Lanzavecchia, Antonio; Marasco, Wayne A.; Shi, Zhengli-Li; Baric, Ralph S.",Nature Medicine,770,1

OBJECTIVES: The main objective of this study was to determine if the referred fever of elderly patients admitted for COVID-19 was related to their mortality. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Data were obtained from the 2020 hospital admissions records of the Hospital de San Juan de Alicante, Spain. RESULTS: Those patients without fever had a greater age and comorbidity. There was not a significant difference related to fever in in-hospital mortality. DISCUSSION: Previous studies seem to indicate that fever in its early stages has a protective effect rather than a harmful one. Our results confirm this trend. No data have been found in the literature that express the differences of elderly patients admitted for COVID-19 who presented fever versus those who did not in the context of hospital admission. CONCLUSION: No significant differences were detected in terms of mortality with respect to the fever variable. However, patients without fever present significantly different laboratory values that could indicate a greater severity in their evolutionary course. For example, patients without fever have significantly higher D-dimer and LDH levels in addition to significantly lower arterial oxygen pressure and PaO2/FiO2 and SpO2/FiO2 ratios.","Roig-Marín, Noel; Roig-Rico, Pablo",Exp Aging Res,770,5

It rapidly spread across the world and was classed as a global pandemic on 11 June 2009. OBJECTIVE: To analyse UK newsprint coverage of the swine flu pandemic. METHODS: Content analysis of 2374 newsprint articles published in eight UK national newspapers between 1 March 2009 and 28 February 2010. RESULTS: Newsprint coverage of the swine flu epidemic was immense. The threat from swine flu was portrayed as greatest in the spring and summer of 2009 when scientific uncertainties about the impact on the UK and global population were at their height and when swine flu cases in the UK first peaked. Thereafter the number of news articles waned, failing to mirror the October peak in flu cases as the virus failed to be as virulent as first feared. Content analysis found little evidence of the media ‘over-hyping’ the swine flu pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: The news media's role as a disseminator of scientific information is particularly important in areas of risk perception. Despite a succession of health scares in recent years in which the media has been accused of exaggerating the risks and contributing to public misunderstandings of the issues, this analysis suggests that the UK newsprint reporting of swine flu in the 2009–10 outbreak was largely measured. The news media's role as disseminators of factual health information on swine flu is to be welcomed, particularly in relation to their handling and responsible reporting on scientific uncertainty.","Hilton, Shona; Hunt, Kate",J Epidemiol Community Health,770,28

International Medical Graduates (IMGs) serve the underserved communities of Kentucky to fill in the physician gap. However, uncertainties surrounding immigration policies added significant challenges to physicians and the rural communities served by them during the pandemic. Methods A survey was created using the data collection platform “SurveyMonkey” and sent to IMG physicians practicing on a visa to understand their role and their immigration-related challenges. Only the physicians practicing in Kentucky were included in this study. Results It was found that 84% practice in primary care specialties like internal medicine, pediatrics, or family medicine, 92.9% practice in Medically Underserved Areas or Health Professional Shortage Areas, and 71.4% practice in rural settings. Also, 61.5% practice in a “frontline” COVID-19 specialty and 92.3% were involved in direct care of COVID-19 infected or suspected patients. Of the physicians, 88.5% were in an “immigration backlog”; 92.6% of them were the primary visa holders of their families and 88.9% expressed concern that their families face hardship if they have a disability during the pandemic. It was reported by 92.3% of them that visa-related restrictions limited them from providing additional coverage in these places. Conclusions Lack of physician access is a critical issue facing many rural states in America like Kentucky, and IMG physicians play a valuable role in taking care of this underserved population and fighting the COVID-19 pandemic. The challenges surrounding the immigration backlog are contributing to significant hardships and remain a hurdle to expand healthcare access to the rural and medically underserved communities.","Malayala, Srikrishna V; Vasireddy, Deepa; Kadali, Renuka Ananth Kalyan; Alur, Ram Sanjeev; Koushik, Kiran",Cureus,770,20

There is a paucity of data concerning coinfection with other common respiratory pathogens in COVID-19 patients outside of Wuhan. Methods: We conducted a double-centre study recruiting 68 patients with severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection confirmed by nucleic acid testing in Qingdao and Wuhan from January 17 to February 16, 2020. Indirect immunofluorescence was performed to detect the specific IgM antibody against common respiratory pathogens in collected acute phase serum. Results: Of the 68 patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection, 30 (44.12%) were from Qingdao. The median age of Qingdao and Wuhan patients were 50 (IQR: 37-59) and 31 (IQR: 28-38) years, respectively, and the majority of patients were female in Qingdao (60.00%) and Wuhan (55.26%). Among COVID-19 patients in Qingdao, 24 (80.00%) of them had IgM antibodies against at least one respiratory pathogen, whereas only one (2.63%) of the patients in Wuhan had positive results for serum IgM antibody detection (P<0.0001). The most common respiratory pathogens detected in Qingdao COVID-19 patients were influenza virus A (60.00%) and influenza virus B (53.33%), followed by mycoplasma pneumoniae (23.33%) and legionella pneumophila (20.00%). While the pattern for coinfection in patients with community-acquired pneumonia in Qingdao was quite different, with a positive rate of only 20.90%. Interpretation: We reported a large proportion of COVID-19 patients with coinfection of seasonal respiratory pathogens in Qingdao, northeast China, which differed greatly from the patients in Wuhan, central China. Precautions are needed when dealing with COVID-19 patients beyond the epidemic centre who have coinfection with other respiratory pathogens.

AIM: To describe and evaluate a primary care transitions clinic that serves patients with medical and/or social needs that must be addressed prior to establishment of primary care. SETTING: Brigham Health, an academic medical center in Boston, MA. PROGRAM DESCRIPTION: The transitions clinic opened within an existing primary care practice in January 2019. It employs one full-time nurse care coordinator and one full-time medical assistant, and is staffed by one primary care physician (PCP) or nurse practitioner each weekday afternoon. Both medical and social diagnoses that require follow-up post-discharge are addressed. Patients with any insurance are seen as many times as necessary until PCP care is established. PROGRAM EVALUATION: In the year after its establishment (January 20, 2019, to January 19, 2020), the transitions clinic received 498 referrals (73.2% from the emergency department (ED), 23.3% from inpatient), with 207 patients ultimately seen. Patients were seen 5 (median; IQR 4–6) work days post-discharge, with 2 (median; IQR 1–3) visits per patient. Patients seen in the transitions clinic had significantly fewer ED visits than a comparator cohort referred to Brigham Health Primary Care after ED or hospital discharge in the year prior (January 20, 2018, to January 20, 2019). Patients seen in the transitions clinic additionally had significantly fewer ED visits and hospitalizations in the three months post-referral than in the three months pre-referral. The most common social determinants addressed by the clinic’s nurse coordinator were insurance, transportation, and housing. DISCUSSION: A primary care transitions clinic can provide accessible, attentive care post-discharge with positive effects on healthcare utilization. Availability of a multidisciplinary team that can see patients for repeated visits until establishment of PCP care was a key success factor for the transitions clinic.

As evidence is emerging that these measures may have slowed the spread of the pandemic, it is important to assess the impact of any changes in strategy, including scenarios for school reopening and broader relaxation of social distancing. This work uses an individual-based model to predict the impact of a suite of possible strategies to reopen schools in the UK, including that currently proposed by the UK government. Methods We use Covasim, a stochastic agent-based model for transmission of COVID-19, calibrated to the UK epidemic. The model describes individuals' contact networks stratified as household, school, work and community layers, and uses demographic and epidemiological data from the UK. We simulate a range of different school reopening strategies with a society-wide relaxation of lockdown measures and in the presence of different non-pharmaceutical interventions, to estimate the number of new infections, cumulative cases and deaths, as well as the effective reproduction number with different strategies. To account for uncertainties within the stochastic simulation, we also simulated different levels of infectiousness of children and young adults under 20 years old compared to older ages. Findings We found that with increased levels of testing of people (between 25% and 72% of symptomatic people tested at some point during an active COVID-19 infection depending on scenarios) and effective contact-tracing and isolation for infected individuals, an epidemic rebound may be prevented across all reopening scenarios, with the effective reproduction number (R) remaining below one and the cumulative number of new infections and deaths significantly lower than they would be if testing did not increase. If UK schools reopen in phases from June 2020, prevention of a second wave would require testing 51% of symptomatic infections, tracing of 40% of their contacts, and isolation of symptomatic and diagnosed cases. However, without such measures, reopening of schools together with gradual relaxing of the lockdown measures are likely to induce a secondary pandemic wave, as are other scenarios for reopening. When infectiousness of <20 year olds was varied from 100% to 50% of that of older ages, our findings remained unchanged. Interpretation To prevent a secondary COVID-19 wave, relaxation of social distancing including reopening schools in the UK must be implemented alongside an active large-scale population-wide testing of symptomatic individuals and effective tracing of their contacts, followed by isolation of symptomatic and diagnosed individuals. Such combined measures have a greater likelihood of controlling the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and preventing a large number of COVID-19 deaths than reopening schools and society with the current level of implementation of testing and isolation of infected individuals.","Panovska-Griffiths, J.; Kerr, C.; Stuart, R.

Professional cleaning of the subgingival biofilm by instrumentation of dental root surfaces, known as scaling and root planning (SRP), is the mainstay of periodontal therapy and is indisputably effective. Non-physical approaches used as adjuncts to SRP, such as chemical and biological agents, will be the focus of this review. In this regard, traditional agents such as oral antiseptics and antibiotics, delivered either locally or systemically, were briefly reviewed as a backdrop. While generally effective in winning the “battle” against PD in the short term, by reducing its signs and symptoms, patients receiving such therapies are more susceptible to recurrence of PD. Moreover, the long-term consequences of such therapies are still in question. In particular, concern about chronic use of systemic antibiotics and their influence on the oral and gut microbiota is warranted, considering antibiotic resistance plasmids, and potential transfer between oral and non-oral microbes. In the interest of winning the “battle and the war”, new more selective and targeted antimicrobials and biologics for PD are being studied. These are principally indirect, blocking pathways involved in bacterial colonization, nutrient acquisition, inflammation or cellular invasion without directly killing the pathogens. This review will focus on current and prospective antimicrobial therapies for PD, emphasizing therapies that act indirectly on the microbiota, with clearly defined cellular and molecular targets.","Elashiry, Mahmoud; Morandini, Ana Carolina; Cornelius Timothius, Celine Joyce; Ghaly, Mira; Cutler, Christopher W.",Int J Mol Sci,770,24

Thus, the Pythagorean fuzzy decision by opinion score method (PFDOSM) for prioritising vaccine recipients is the correct approach because it utilises the most powerful MCDM ranking method. However, PFDOSM weighs the criteria values of each alternative implicitly, which is limited to explicitly weighting each criterion. In view of solving this theoretical issue, the fuzzy-weighted zero-inconsistency (FWZIC) can be used as a powerful weighting MCDM method to provide explicit weights for a criteria set with zero inconstancy. However, FWZIC is based on the triangular fuzzy number that is limited in solving the vagueness related to the aforementioned theoretical issues. OBJECTIVES: This research presents a novel homogeneous Pythagorean fuzzy framework for distributing the COVID-19 vaccine dose by integrating a new formulation of the Pythagorean fuzzy-weighted zero-inconsistency (PFWZIC) and PFDOSM methods. METHODS: The methodology is divided into two phases. Firstly, an augmented dataset was generated that included 300 recipients based on five COVID-19 vaccine distribution criteria (i.e., vaccine recipient memberships, chronic disease conditions, age, geographic location severity and disabilities). Then, a decision matrix was constructed on the basis of an intersection of the ‘recipients list’ and ‘COVID-19 distribution criteria’. Then, the MCDM methods were integrated. An extended PFWZIC was developed, followed by the development of PFDOSM. RESULTS: (1) PFWZIC effectively weighted the vaccine distribution criteria. (2) The PFDOSM-based group prioritisation was considered in the final distribution result. (3) The prioritisation ranks of the vaccine recipients were subject to a systematic ranking that is supported by high correlation results over nine scenarios of the changing criteria weights values. A comparison with previous work also proved the efficiency of the proposed framework. CONCLUSION: The findings of this study are expected to contribute to ensuring equitable protection against COVID-19 and thus help accelerate vaccine progress worldwide.","Albahri, O.S.; Zaidan, A.A.; Albahri, A.S.; Alsattar, H.A.; Mohammed, Rawia; Aickelin, Uwe; Kou, Gang; Jumaah, FM.; Salih, Mahmood M.; Alamoodi, A.H.; Zaidan, B.B.; Alazab, Mamoun; Alnoor, Alhamzah; Al-Obaidi, Jameel R.",J Adv Res,770,23

However, studies investigating the potential benefits of different UIs for DMHS are currently lacking. To fill this knowledge gap, the aim of this study was to investigate differences in treatment engagement between two different UIs for DMHS. METHODS: A total of 397 participants from the Swedish general public were randomized (1:1) to use a self-guided digital problem-solving intervention during one week, either with an optimized UI (N = 198), based on user experience (UX) design principles and with automated features, or a basic UI (N = 199), analogous with a UI used in Swedish regular health care comprising elementary UI features and less automation. Primary outcome measures were self-rated usability, on the System Usability Scale, and treatment credibility, on the Credibility/Expectancy Questionnaire. Secondary outcome measures included behavioral engagement with the intervention. FINDINGS: There were no significant differences between the UIs in ratings of usability or treatment credibility. However, participants who used the optimized UI were significantly more engaged with the intervention as measured by usage of the intervention at least once (odds ratio 2.54, 95% CI [1.67, 3.85]), total number of generated solutions (mean difference 1.41, 95% CI [0.72, 2.11]), and mean number of generated solutions per initiated problem-solving attempt (mean difference 1.45, 95% CI [1.06, 1.85]). Other findings included participants using the optimized UI rating the intervention as easier to understand, while feeling more overwhelmed, than those using the basic UI. INTERPRETATION: Our findings indicate that an optimized UI based on UX design principles, in comparison to a basic UI comprising elementary UI features, do not affect overall self-rated usability or treatment credibility but increases some measures of behavioral engagement with a digital intervention.

However, instead of breaking down, many families and therapists have hunkered down to cope with this ‘wicked’ situation as it continues to evolve. This article examines the unique challenges and opportunities of COVID‐19 for families at different life developmental stages, as well as the challenges and opportunities for systemic therapists as they venture into unfamiliar territory. Through a case example and by integrating recent literature related to this pandemic, we apply three key and interconnected systemic themes (unsafe uncertainty, family life cycle, and social diversity) to discuss the challenges and opportunities for families and therapists, respectively. We are optimistic that there are many possibilities as families and therapists draw on, and often reinvent, currently available resources to navigate their course in this pandemic. We also find that while the pandemic continues to present unsafe and uncertain situations, there are new ways of being and behaving, especially when families and professionals work together collaboratively. Despite formidable challenges, there are many opportunities, both within families and communities that cut through different social contexts related to family, culture, economics, and even politics. Families and therapists could endure better when they are more cognisant of how and what these contexts may impact and offer them.","Singh, Reenee; Sim, Timothy",Aust N Z J Fam Ther,770,33

To better understand the long-term course and etiology of symptoms we analyzed a cohort of patients with COVID-19 prospectively. METHODS: Patients were included at 5 months after acute COVID-19 in this prospective, noninterventional, follow-up study. Patients followed until 12 months after COVID-19 symptom onset (n = 96; 32.3% hospitalized, 55.2% females) were included in this analysis of symptoms, quality of life (based on an SF-12 survey), laboratory parameters including antinuclear antibodies (ANAs), and SARS-CoV-2 antibody levels. RESULTS: At month 12, only 22.9% of patients were completely free of symptoms and the most frequent symptoms were reduced exercise capacity (56.3%), fatigue (53.1%), dyspnea (37.5%), and problems with concentration (39.6%), finding words (32.3%), and sleeping (26.0%). Females showed significantly more neurocognitive symptoms than males. ANA titers were ≥1:160 in 43.6% of patients at 12 months post–COVID-19 symptom onset, and neurocognitive symptom frequency was significantly higher in the group with an ANA titer ≥1:160 versus <1:160. Compared with patients without symptoms, patients with ≥1 long-COVID symptom at 12 months did not differ significantly with respect to their SARS-CoV-2 antibody levels but had a significantly reduced physical and mental life quality compared with patients without symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Neurocognitive long-COVID symptoms can persist ≥1 year after COVID-19 symptom onset and reduce life quality significantly. Several neurocognitive symptoms were associated with ANA titer elevations. This may indicate autoimmunity as a cofactor in etiology of long COVID.","Seeßle, Jessica; Waterboer, Tim; Hippchen, Theresa; Simon, Julia; Kirchner, Marietta; Lim, Adeline; Müller, Barbara; Merle, Uta",Clin Infect Dis,770,22

Aim: We aimed to examine the effects of social distancing, loneliness, difficulties in emotion regulation, and self-regulation on participants self-reported coping using sex during lockdown in the UK. METHODS: Participants had to be residents of the UK, aged between 18 – 60 years, fluent in English, and had to have an internet connection. Participants were instructed not to participate if they had consumed alcohol in the previous 24 hours. A total of 789 participants aged 18-59 completed an online survey. Participants completed self-report measures of social distancing, loneliness, and difficulties in emotion regulation. A Go/No-Go task was used to assess self-regulation. Outcomes: Participants self-reported their use of sex to cope over a 14-day period during lockdown, as well as retrospectively for a 14-day period immediately preceding lockdown. Coping using sex items included consensual and non-consensual themes. RESULTS: Overall, there was no increase in coping using sex during compared with before lockdown. Findings showed that 30% of participants reported increased coping using sex during lockdown compared with before, 29% reported decreased coping using sex, and 41% reported no change. All regression models included age, gender, ethnicity, diagnosis of psychiatric condition, level of education, being at high-risk for difficulties relating to COVID-19, living alone, and diagnosed or suspected COVID-19 as covariates. Being younger, being male, and greater emotion dysregulation were associated with higher coping using sex total and consent subscale scores during lockdown. Being younger, being male, not living alone, and less adherence to social distancing advice was associated with coping using sex with a theme of rape/violence during lockdown. Clinical Translation: A proportion of participants used sex to cope more often during lockdown compared with before. Less adherence to social distancing advice and emotion dysregulation were associated with using sex to cope during lockdown. Strengths and Limitations: Strengths of this study were the large sample size and inclusion of key socio-demographic characteristics as covariates. The main limitations were the cross-sectional design and a sample that was mostly white, educated, and female. CONCLUSION: Participants who had difficulty regulating emotions were more likely to use sex to cope. It is important that support is available for people who have problems regulating their emotions during the pandemic and that they have access to appropriate help and advice.","Gillespie, Steven M.; Jones, Andrew; Uzieblo, Kasia; Garofalo, Carlo; Robinson, Eric",J Sex Med,770,24

Firstly, we found that the distribution of outbreaks in universities in late 2020 was consistent with the expected importation of infection from arriving students. Considering outbreaks at one university, larger halls of residence posed higher risks for transmission. The dynamics of transmission from university outbreaks to wider communities is complex, and while sometimes spillover does occur, occasionally even large outbreaks do not give any detectable signal of spillover to the local population. Secondly, we explored proposed control measures for reopening and keeping open universities. We found the proposal of staggering the return of students to university residence is of limited value in terms of reducing transmission. We show that student adherence to testing and self-isolation is likely to be much more important for reducing transmission during term time. Finally, we explored strategies for testing students in the context of a more transmissible variant and found that frequent testing would be necessary to prevent a major outbreak.","Enright, Jessica; Hill, Edward M.; Stage, Helena B.; Bolton, Kirsty J.; Nixon, Emily J.; Fairbanks, Emma L.; Tang, Maria L.; Brooks-Pollock, Ellen; Dyson, Louise; Budd, Chris J.; Hoyle, Rebecca B.; Schewe, Lars; Gog, Julia R.; Tildesley, Michael J.",Royal Society Open Science,770,10

A proposed treatment could use synthesized proteins to mask pathogenic viral surface proteins to quickly induce an immune attack on specific enveloped viruses by using existing immune cells. One treatment could inject dual‐protein ligand masks into patients' blood streams to mask pathogenic surface proteins used to infect mammalian cells. The mammalian immune system already uses an analogous, more complex structure called a pentraxin to neutralize some pathogens by connecting their surface proteins to immune cells. And several types of antiviral peptides have already experimentally demonstrated effectiveness in blocking various viral pathogen infections. These treatments offer advantages, especially for currently untreatable viral pathogens. Furthermore, using dual‐protein ligands and the antigenic memory of some subpopulations of NK cells would also allow the creation of defacto vaccines based on a host's NK cells, instead of vaccines utilizing CD4 and CD8 α:β T cells, which are limited by the requirement of MHC presentation of the target antigens to α:β T cells. Targeted NK cell vaccines could attack host cells latently or actively infected by intracellular pathogens, even host cells having pathogen downregulated MHC antigen presentation. Eight postulates concerning the effects of pathogen mutation, or change in phenotype from genetic recombination or rearrangement, and replication rates on pathogen versus host dominance are also listed, which should be applicable to viral and non‐viral pathogens.","Roe, Kevin",Scand J Immunol,770,1

GWAS focuses on identifying single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with certain diseases such as cancer and diabetes, and the chi-squared (χ(2)) hypothesis test of independence can be utilized for this identification. However, recent studies have shown that publishing the results of χ(2) tests of SNPs or personal data could lead to privacy violations. Several studies have proposed anonymization methods for χ(2) testing with ε-differential privacy, which is the cryptographic community’s de facto privacy metric. However, existing methods can only be applied to 2×2 or 2×3 contingency tables, otherwise their accuracy is low for small numbers of samples. It is difficult to collect numerous high-sensitive samples in many cases such as COVID-19 analysis in its early propagation stage. RESULTS: We propose a novel anonymization method (RandChiDist), which anonymizes χ(2) testing for small samples. We prove that RandChiDist satisfies differential privacy. We also experimentally evaluate its analysis using synthetic datasets and real two genomic datasets. RandChiDist achieved the least number of Type II errors among existing and baseline methods that can control the ratio of Type I errors. CONCLUSIONS: We propose a new differentially private method, named RandChiDist, for anonymizing χ(2) values for an I×J contingency table with a small number of samples.

However, the determinants of susceptibility to acute respiratory tract infections still need to be defined. Objective We investigated whether the individual variation in antiviral response at birth determines the risk for acute respiratory tract illness in the first year of life. Methods We studied 82 children who were enrolled in a birth cohort study of inner-city children with at least 1 parent with allergy or asthma. We cultured cord blood monocytes and assessed IFNG and CCL5 mRNA production at 24 hours after inoculation with respiratory syncytial virus. We also monitored the frequency of acute respiratory tract illness at 3-month intervals and analyzed nasal lavage samples for respiratory tract viruses at the time of illness during the first year. Results Respiratory tract infection was reported for 88% of subjects, and respiratory tract viruses were recovered in 74% of symptomatic children. We observed a wide range of antiviral responses in cord blood monocytes across the population. Furthermore, a decrease in production of IFNG (but not CCL5) mRNA in response to respiratory syncytial virus infection of monocytes was associated with a significant increase in the frequency of upper respiratory tract infections (r = −0.42, P < .001) and the prevalence of ear and sinus infections, pneumonias, and respiratory-related hospitalizations. Conclusion Individual variations in the innate immune response to respiratory tract viruses are detectable even at birth, and these differences predict the susceptibility to acute respiratory tract illness during the first year of life.","Sumino, Kaharu; Tucker, Jennifer; Shahab, Muhammad; Jaffee, Katy F.; Visness, Cynthia M.; Gern, James E.; Bloomberg, Gordon R.; Holtzman, Michael J.",Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology,770,24

In this study, we evaluated the protective efficacy of an intranasal Poly I:C adjuvanted UV inactivated bivalent swine influenza vaccine consisting of Swine/OH/24366/07 H1N1 and Swine/CO/99 H3N2, referred as PAV, in maternal antibody positive pigs against an antigenic variant and a heterologous swine influenza virus challenge. Groups of three-week-old commercial-grade pigs were immunized intranasally with PAV or a commercial vaccine (CV) twice at 2 weeks intervals. Three weeks after the second immunization, pigs were challenged with the antigenic variant Swine/MN/08 H1N1 (MN08) and the heterologous Swine/NC/10 H1N2 (NC10) influenza virus. Antibodies in serum and respiratory tract, lung lesions, virus shedding in nasal secretions and virus load in lungs were assessed. Intranasal administration of PAV induced challenge viruses specific-hemagglutination inhibition- and IgG antibodies in the serum and IgA and IgG antibodies in the respiratory tract. Importantly, intranasal administration of PAV provided protection against the antigenic variant MN08 and the heterologous NC10 swine influenza viruses as evidenced by significant reductions in lung virus load, gross lung lesions and significantly reduced shedding of challenge viruses in nasal secretions. These results indicate that Poly I:C or its homologues may be effective as vaccine adjuvants capable of generating cross-protective immunity against antigenic variants/heterologous swine influenza viruses in pigs.","Thomas, Milton; Wang, Zhao; Sreenivasan, Chithra C.; Hause, Ben M.; Gourapura J.

Clinics frequently struggle to choose a screening approach that is best suited to their resources, workflows, and patient populations. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate how to best implement electronic health record (EHR)–integrated screening for substance use by comparing commonly used screening methods and examining their association with implementation outcomes. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This article presents the outcomes of phases 3 and 4 of a 4-phase quality improvement, implementation feasibility study in which researchers worked with stakeholders at 6 primary care clinics in 2 large urban academic health care systems to define and implement their optimal screening approach. Site A was located in New York City and comprised 2 clinics, and site B was located in Boston, Massachusetts, and comprised 4 clinics. Clinics initiated screening between January 2017 and October 2018, and 93 114 patients were eligible for screening for alcohol and drug use. Data used in the analysis were collected between January 2017 and October 2019, and analysis was performed from July 13, 2018, to March 23, 2021. INTERVENTIONS: Clinics integrated validated screening questions and a brief counseling script into the EHR, with implementation supported by the use of clinical champions (ie, clinicians who advocate for change, motivate others, and use their expertise to facilitate the adoption of an intervention) and the training of clinic staff. Clinics varied in their screening approaches, including the type of visit targeted for screening (any visit vs annual examinations only), the mode of administration (staff-administered vs self-administered by the patient), and the extent to which they used practice facilitation and EHR usability testing. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Data from the EHRs were extracted quarterly for 12 months to measure implementation outcomes. The primary outcome was screening rate for alcohol and drug use. Secondary outcomes were the prevalence of unhealthy alcohol and drug use detected via screening, and clinician adoption of a brief counseling script. RESULTS: Patients of the 6 clinics had a mean (SD) age ranging from 48.9 (17.3) years at clinic B2 to 59.1 (16.7) years at clinic B3, were predominantly female (52.4% at clinic A1 to 64.6% at clinic A2), and were English speaking. Racial diversity varied by location. Of the 93,114 patients with primary care visits, 71.8% received screening for alcohol use, and 70.5% received screening for drug use. Screening at any visit (implemented at site A) in comparison with screening at annual examinations only (implemented at site B) was associated with higher screening rates for alcohol use (90.3%-94.7% vs 24.2%-72.0%, respectively) and drug use (89.6%-93.9% vs 24.6%-69.8%). The 5 clinics that used a self-administered screening approach had a higher detection rate for moderate- to high-risk alcohol use (14.7%-36.6%) compared with the 1 clinic that used a staff-administered screening approach (1.6%). The detection of moderate- to high-risk drug use was low across all clinics (0.5%-1.0%). Clinics with more robust practice facilitation and EHR usability testing had somewhat greater adoption of the counseling script for patients with moderate-high risk alcohol or drug use (1.4%-12.5% vs 0.1%-1.1%). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this quality improvement study, EHR-integrated screening was feasible to implement in all clinics and unhealthy alcohol use was detected more frequently when self-administered screening was used at any primary care visit. The detection of drug use was low at all clinics, as was clinician adoption of counseling. These findings can be used to inform the decision-making of health care systems that are seeking to implement screening for substance use.

We therefore described the organization of a province-level healthcare system during the occurrence of the COVID-19 epidemic and the 60-day outcomes of the hospitalized COVID-19 patients according to the respiratory strategy adopted given the limited available resources. PATIENTS AND METHODS: All COVID-19 patients (26/02/2020–18/04/2020) in the Rimini Province of Italy were included in this population-based cohort study. The hospitalized patients were classified according to the maximum level of respiratory support: oxygen supplementation (Oxygen group), non-invasive ventilation (NIV-only group), invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV-only group), and IMV after an NIV trial (IMV-after-NIV group). Sixty-day mortality risk was estimated with a Cox proportional hazard analysis adjusted by age, sex, and administration of steroids, canakinumab, and tocilizumab. RESULTS: We identified a total of 1,424 symptomatic patients: 520 (36.5%) were hospitalized, while 904 (63.5%) were treated at home with no 60-day deaths. Based on the respiratory support, 408 (78.5%) were assigned to the Oxygen group, 46 (8.8%) to the NIV-only group, 25 (4.8%) to the IMV-after-NIV group, and 41 (7.9%) to the IMV-only group. There was no significant difference in the PaO(2)/FiO(2) at IMV inception in the IMV-after-NIV and IMV-only groups (p=0.9). Overall 60-day mortality was 24.2% (Oxygen: 23.0%; NIV-only: 19.6%; IMV-after-NIV: 32.0%; IMV-only: 36.6%; p=0.165). Compared with the Oxygen group, the adjusted 60-day mortality risk significantly increased in the IMV-after-NIV (HR 2.776; p=0.024) and IMV-only groups (HR 2.966; p=0.001). CONCLUSION: This study provided a population-based estimate of the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak in a severely affected Italian province. A similar 60-day mortality risk was found for patients undergoing immediate IMV and those intubated after an NIV trial with favorable outcomes after prolonged IMV.","Potalivo, Antonella; Montomoli, Jonathan; Facondini, Francesca; Sanson, Gianfranco; Lazzari Agli, Luigi Arcangelo; Perin, Tiziana; Cristini, Francesco; Cavagna, Enrico; De Giovanni, Raffaella; Biagetti, Carlo; Panzini, Ilaria; Ravaioli, Cinzia; Bitondo, Maria Maddalena; Guerra, Daniela; Giuliani, Giovanni; Mosconi, Elena; Guarino, Sonia; Marchionni, Elisa; Gangitano, Gianfilippo; Valentini, Ilaria; Giampaolo, Luca; Muratore, Francesco; Nardi, Giuseppe",Clin Epidemiol,770,24

The impact assessment requires socioeconomic scenarios, including a long-term outlook for demographic and economic indices. In Japan, the National Institute for Environmental Studies developed the Japan Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (JPNSSPs) and presented regional population scenarios corresponding to five different storylines. However, there exists no quantitative information about changes in local economies under the population scenarios. This study examines the economic activities in Japan's 47 prefectures using statistical models and calculates changes in the major economic indices (e.g., production, capital stock, and labor population) until 2100. The economic projection is based on ten socioeconomic scenarios generated from the JPNSSP population scenarios and original productivity scenarios. The economic projection results clearly show that Japan's population aging and decline have catastrophic impacts on national and subnational economies. Even in the most optimistic scenario, assuming a massive influx of immigrants and fast productivity growth, the GDP growth rate becomes negative in the 2090s. In the most pessimistic scenario, the GDP growth rate becomes negative in 2028 and continues to decline. As a result, Japan's GDP decreases to the level of the 1970s by 2100. The improvement of productivity cannot offset the GDP shrink caused by demographic changes. Furthermore, the population aging and decline accelerate the wealth concentration in urban areas. The Theil index, calculated using the economic projection results, shows increasing trends in all the scenarios. Tokyo's presence in Japan's economy will continue to increase throughout this century. Meanwhile, Kanagawa and Saitama, which belong to the top five prefectures in terms of economic production, may lose their positions. The Tohoku region, already suffering from population decline, will face severe economic stagnation. Our findings suggest that the depressing future is inevitable unless Japan overcomes the population aging and decline.","Honjo, Keita; Gomi, Kei; Kanamori, Yuko; Takahashi, Kiyoshi; Matsuhashi, Keisuke",Heliyon,770,23

This study traced its diffusion from the global to national level and identified a few superspreaders that played a central role in the transmission of this disease in India. DATA AND METHODS: We used the travel history of infected patients from January 30 to April 6, 2020, as the primary data source. A total of 1386 cases were assessed, of which 373 were international, and 1013 were national contacts. The networks were generated in Gephi software (version 0.9.2). RESULTS: The maximum numbers of connections were established from Dubai (degree 144) and the UK (degree 64). Dubai’s eigenvector centrality was the highest that made it the most influential node. The statistical metrics calculated from the data revealed that Dubai and the UK played a crucial role in spreading the disease in Indian states and were the primary sources of COVID-19 importations into India. Based on the modularity class, different clusters were shown to form across Indian states, which demonstrated the formation of a multi-layered social network structure. A significant increase in confirmed cases was reported in states like Tamil Nadu, Delhi, and Andhra Pradesh during the first phase of the nationwide lockdown, which spanned from March 25 to April 14, 2020. This was primarily attributed to a gathering at the Delhi Religious Conference (DRC) known as Tabliqui Jamaat. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 got induced into Indian states mainly due to International travels with the very first patient travelling from Wuhan, China. Subsequently, the contacts of positive cases were located, and a significant spread was identified in states like Gujarat, Rajasthan, Maharashtra, Kerala, and Karnataka. The COVID-19’s spread in phase one was traced using the travelling history of the patients, and it was found that most of the transmissions were local.","Azad, Sarita; Devi, Sushma",J Travel Med,770,19

We assessed the effectiveness of therapeutics in cohorts in Hong Kong SAR and Anhui, China. METHODS: We conducted propensity-score analysis of 4771 symptomatic patients from Hong Kong between 21st January and 6th December 2020, and 648 symptomatic patients from Anhui between 1st January and 27th February 2020. We censored all observations as at 13st December 2020. Time from hospital admission to discharge, and composite outcome of death, invasive mechanical ventilation or intensive care unit admission across 1) all therapeutic options including lopinavir-ritonavir, ribavirin, umifenovir, interferon-alpha-2b, interferon-beta-1b, corticosteroids, antibiotics, and Chinese medicines, and 2) four interferon-beta-1b combination treatment groups were investigated. FINDINGS: Interferon-beta-1b was associated with an improved composite outcome (OR=0.55, 95%CI 0.38, 0.80) and earlier discharge (−8.8 days, 95%CI −9.7, −7.9) compared to those not administered interferon-beta-1b. Oral ribavirin initiated within 7 days from onset was associated with lower risk of the composite outcome in Hong Kong (OR=0.51, 95%CI 0.29, 0.90). Lopinavir-ritonavir, intravenous ribavirin, umifenovir, corticosteroids, interferon-alpha-2b, antibiotics or Chinese medicines failed to show consistent clinical benefit. Interferon-beta-1b co-administered with ribavirin was associated with improved composite outcome (OR=0.50, 95%CI 0.32, 0.78) and earlier discharge (−2.35 days, 95%CI −3.65, −1.06) compared to interferon-beta-1b monotherapy.

The main purpose of the RRT were: 1) consultation to the Government controlling MERS-CoV outbreak. 2) Visit hospitals that were exposed to MERS-CoV infected patients, and to provide advice regarding infection control strategy for rehabilitating of the exposed hospitals. Since June 8th, the RRT visited more than 10 hospitals and an effective consultation was carried out. Most of the hospitals were recovering from the MERS outbreak since early July.

The acetaminophen absorption test (APAT) was used to determine abomasal emptying rate. Four healthy and five diarrheic female Holstein-Friesian calves (age < 14 days) were included in the study. For APAT, calves were fed 2 L of milk replacer containing 50 mg acetaminophen/kg body weight, and blood samples were taken during a 12-h period afterward. Concomitantly, a WAC in the abomasum continuously measured luminal pH, pressure, and temperature. Five hours post suckling, intraluminal temperature was significantly higher in diarrheic calves than in healthy calves. Abomasal pH and pressure were not significantly different, but intraluminal pressure was always numerically lower in diarrheic calves. During APAT no significant differences in maximum acetaminophen concentrations (C(max)) and time to reach maximum acetaminophen concentration (T(max)) were observed. Nonlinear regression findings revealed a longer acetaminophen half-time (AAP t(1/2)) in diarrheic calves compared to healthy calves [564 ± 96 min vs. 393 ± 84 min, respectively; P = 0.04] and lower area under the concentration curve values (e.g., 60 min postprandial AUC(60) 681 ± 244 (µg∙min)/mL vs. 1064 ± 23 (µg∙min)/mL, respectively; P = 0.04). In conclusion, abomasal luminal conditions were different between diarrheic and healthy calves. Significant differences in APAT reflected a delay in abomasal emptying in diarrheic calves. Impaired abomasal movement may induce enhanced bacterial fermentation processes as indicated by a higher abomasal temperature in diarrheic calves, which should be considered in management of their feeding.","Hildebrandt, Thomas; Scheuch, Eberhard; Weitschies, Werner; Grimm, Michael; Schneider, Felix; Bachmann, Lisa; Vervuert, Ingrid",Livest Sci,770,16

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: 21 residents in a senior living community and a family member (who participated in the VR with the older adult from a distance) engaged in a baseline telephone call, followed by 3 weekly VR sessions. RESULTS: Residents and family members alike found the VR safe, extremely enjoyable, and easy to use. The VR was also acceptable and highly satisfying for residents with MCI and dementia. Human and automated coding revealed that residents were more conversationally and behaviorally engaged with their family member in the VR sessions compared to the baseline telephone call and in the VR sessions that used reminiscence therapy. The results also illustrate the importance of using multiple methods to assess engagement. Residents with dementia reported greater immersion in the VR than residents with MCI. However, the automated coding indicated that residents with MCI were more kinesically engaged while using the VR than residents with dementia.

As new epicentres in Europe and America have arisen, of particular concern is the increased number of imported coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases in Africa, where the impact of the pandemic could be more severe. We aim to estimate the number of COVID-19 cases imported from 12 major epicentres in Europe and America to each African country, as well as the probability of reaching 10,000 cases in total by the end of March, April, May, and June following viral introduction. METHODS: We used the reported number of cases imported from the 12 major epicentres in Europe and America to Singapore, as well as flight data, to estimate the number of imported cases in each African country. Under the assumption that Singapore has detected all the imported cases, the estimates for Africa were thus conservative. We then propagated the uncertainty in the imported case count estimates to simulate the onward spread of the virus, until 10,000 cases are reached or the end of June, whichever is earlier. Specifically, 1,000 simulations were run separately under four different combinations of parameter values to test the sensitivity of our results. RESULTS: We estimated Morocco, Algeria, South Africa, Egypt, Tunisia, and Nigeria as having the largest number of COVID-19 cases imported from the 12 major epicentres. Based on our 1,000 simulation runs, Morocco and Algeria’s estimated probability of reaching 10,000 cases by end of March was close to 100% under all scenarios. In particular, we identified countries with less than 1,000 cases in total reported by end of June whilst the estimated probability of reaching 10,000 cases by then was higher than 50% even under the most optimistic scenario. CONCLUSIONS: Our study highlights particular countries that are likely to reach (or have reached) 10,000 cases far earlier than the reported data suggest, calling for the prioritization of resources to mitigate the further spread of the epidemic.","Sun, Haoyang; Dickens, Borame L.; Cook, Alex R.; Clapham, Hannah E.",BMC Infect Dis,770,24

Arrest histories are linked to comprehensive longitudinal measurement on over 1,000 individuals originally from Chicago. Using group-based trajectory modeling, we investigated the magnitude and type of cohort differences in trajectories of arrest over the period 1995 to 2020. Our results show that trajectory group membership varies strongly by birth cohort. Membership in the nonoffender group is nearly 15 percentage points higher for cohorts born in the mid-1990s as compared to those born in the 1980s; conversely, older cohorts are more likely to be members of adolescent-limited and chronic-offender groups. Large cohort differences in trajectory group membership persist after controlling for a wide-ranging set of demographic characteristics and early-life risk factors that vary by cohort and that prior research has identified as important influences on crime. Not only does the effect of social change on cohort differentiation persist, but its magnitude is comparable to—indeed larger than—differences in trajectory group membership associated with varying levels of self-control or by whether individuals grew up in high-poverty households. These results suggest that changes in the broader social environment shared by members of the same birth cohort are as powerful in shaping their trajectory group membership as classic predictors identified in prior research, a finding that carries implications for crime-control policies that rely on prediction.","Neil, Roland; Sampson, Robert J.; Nagin, Daniel S.",Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,770,20

Whether the pandemic could change the association between cold temperature and mortality remains unknown. Objectives: We aimed to assess whether the association between cold temperature and all-cause mortality in the pandemic period has changed compared to non-COVID-19 period (2015-2019) in Italy. Methods: We collected daily all-cause mortality data and meteorological data for 107 Italian provinces from 1, January 2015 to 31, May 2020. A time-stratified case-crossover design with the distributed lag non-linear model was used to examine the association between cold temperature and all-cause mortality during the first three months (from March to May in 2020) of the COVID-19 outbreak and the same months in 2015-2019. Results: The relative risk (RR) of all-cause mortality at extreme cold temperature (2.5th percentile of temperature at 3 {degrees}C) in comparison with the minimum mortality temperature (24 {degrees}C) was 4.75 [95% confidence interval (CI): 3.90-5.79] in the pandemic period, which is more than triple higher than RR [1.41 (95%CI: 1.33-1.50)] in the same months during 2015-2019. The shift in cold-mortality association was particularly significant for people aged 65-74 years [RR (95%CI): 5.98 (3.78-9.46) in 2020 versus 1.29 (1.10-1.51) in 2015-2019], 75-84 years [5.25 (3.79-7.26) versus 1.40 (1.25-1.56)], and [≥] 85 years [5.03 (3.90-6.51) versus 1.52 (1.39-1.66)], but not significant for those aged 0-64 years [1.95 (1.17-3.24) versus 1.24 (1.05-1.48)]. Conclusion: The findings suggest that the COVID-19 pandemic enhanced the risk of cold temperature on mortality in Italy, particularly among the elderly people.

The virtual journal club (VJC), initiated as a robust solution to many educational challenges encountered during COVID-19 pandemic-related distance learning, provides an enduring and fluid forum for multilevel teaching and learning. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this manuscript we share our institutions' reasoning and methods to implement a VJC for multi-level learners. A standardized format applicable to all VJC sessions was adopted to ensure reproducibility from presenter to presenter. Sessions were held via video conference platforms. Pedagogy regularly emphasized in undergraduate medical education was adopted. Informal assessment of each session's strengths and areas for improvement was performed. RESULTS: A total of 30 sessions were held prior to manuscript submission, including discussion of 36 refereed journal articles from March 26, 2020, to April 20, 2021. The virtual journal club was very well received by all participants. The medical students and residents found the information current and engaging. The fellows stated that the journal club strengthened their knowledge base and enhanced communication and teaching skills. The attendings learned from its encouraged frank discussion of differing practice patterns. The format of these sessions offers an ideal setting to teach medical students and residents how to evaluate and employ evidence-based medicine and meets multiple LCME and ACGME requirements. CONCLUSIONS: This VJC forum allows for development of essential nonclinical skills including lifelong active learning and analysis, peer collaboration, and technology adaptation and usage.","Belfi, Lily M.; Dean, Kathryn E.; Sailer, David S.; Kesler, Thomas; Jordan, Sheryl G.",Curr Probl Diagn Radiol,770,20

This study examines associations of changing COVID-19-related employment conditions with physical activity and sedentary behavior. Methods: Data from 2,303 US adults in employment prior to COVID-19 were collected April 3rd−7th, 2020. Participants reported whether their employment remained unchanged, they were working from home (WFH) when they had not been before, or they lost their job due to the pandemic. Validated questionnaires assessed physical activity, sitting time, and screen time. Linear regression quantified associations of COVID-19-related employment changes with physical activity, sitting time, and screen time, controlling for age, sex, race, BMI, smoking status, marital status, chronic conditions, household location, public health restrictions, and recalled physical activity, sitting time, and screen time prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. Results: Compared to those whose employment remained unchanged, participants whose employment changed (either WFH or lost their job) due to COVID-19 reported higher sitting time (WFH: g = 0.153, 95% CI = 0.095–0.210; lost job: g = 0.212, 0.113–0.311) and screen time (WFH: g = 0.158, 0.104–0.212; lost job: g = 0.193, 0.102–0.285). There were no significant group differences for physical activity (WFH: g = −0.030, −0.101 to 0.042; lost job: g=-0.070, −0.178 to 0.037). Conclusion: COVID-19 related employment changes were associated with greater sitting and screen time. As sedentary time is consistently negatively associated with current and future health and wellbeing, increased sedentary time due to employment changes is a public health concern.","McDowell, Cillian P.; Herring, Matthew P.; Lansing, Jeni; Brower, Cassandra; Meyer, Jacob D.",Front Public Health,770,6

This article explores the potential value of using triage tests before reference tests when the capacity of the reference test is constrained. METHODS: We developed a simple model with inputs: prevalence, sensitivity, specificity, and reference test capacity. We included a case study of rapid diagnostic tests for SARS-CoV-2 antigens used as triage tests before a reference polymerase chain reaction test. Performance data were obtained from an evaluation performed by an academic center on 425 samples from testing centers in the United Kingdom and Germany. RESULTS: When reference test capacity is constrained, the use of a triage test leads to a relative expansion of the population tested and cases identified; both are higher with a high-specificity triage test. When reference test capacity is not constrained, the potential advantages of introducing a triage test can be assessed using a standard cost-utility framework, balancing the utility of the reduction in the number of reference tests required against the disutility of missed cases associated with the use of a lower-sensitivity triage test. In the constrained case, the advantage of a triage testing strategy in terms of population covered and cases identified is reduced as the prevalence increases. In the unconstrained case, the reduction in reference tests required is reduced and the number of cases missed increase as the prevalence rises. CONCLUSION: When the availability of the reference test is constrained, tests added in a triage position do not need high levels of accuracy to increase the number of cases diagnosed. This has implications in many disease areas, including COVID-19.","Bouttell, Janet; Hawkins, Neil",Med Decis Making,770,6

Objectives: In this observational multicenter study, based on children with AAE, we aimed to assess the proportion of household members possibly infected by SARS-CoV-2. Methods: We collected data from all children observed with AAE, prospectively from April 7, 2020 to June 22, 2020, and retrospectively since February 28, 2020. The primary outcome was the household infection rate, defined as the proportion of family clusters having at least one member with COVID-19 infection other than the child with AAE (“index child”). The definition of a case was based on characteristic clinical signs and a positive PCR or serology. Results: The study included 103 children in 10 French departments and in Quebec. The median age was 13 years and the interquartile range [8-15], with a female-to-male ratio of 1/1.15. In children with AAE, all PCR tests were negative (n=18), and serology was positive in 2/14 (14.3%) cases. We found no significant anomalies in the lab results. 66 of the 103 families (64.1%) of included children had at least one other infected member apart from the index child. The total number of household members was 292, of whom 119 (40.8%) were considered possibly infected by SARS-CoV-2. No index children or households exhibited severe COVID-19. Discussion: Among the 103 households included, 64.1% had at least one infected member. Neither children with AAE nor their households showed severe COVID-19.","Hubiche, T; Phan, A; Leducq, S; Rapp, J; Fertitta, L; Aubert, H; Barbarot, S; Chiaverini, C; Giraudeau, B; Lasek, A; Mallet, S; Labarelle, A; Piram, M; McCuaig, C; Martin, L; Monitor, L; Nicol, I; Bissuel, M; Bellissen, A; Jullien, D; Lesort, C; Vabres, P; Maruani, A",Ann Dermatol Venereol,770,26

This pilot study investigated the effectiveness of a daily 14-h metabolic fast (14:10 TRE beginning after dinner, a “fasting snack” at hour 12, and ending with breakfast 14 h later) combined with a commercial weight management program on body weight and fasting blood glucose (FBG) in individuals with obesity. We also investigated the effect of the low-calorie, high-fat, low-carbohydrate, and low-protein “fasting snack” on blood glucose. METHODS: This 8-week, randomized, controlled, clinical trial included men and women (BMI ≥ 30 kg/m(2)) between June and October 2020. Study procedures were conducted remotely. Participants were randomized to 14:10 or 12-h TRE (12:12, active comparator) and prescribed a diet (controlled for calories and macronutrient composition) and exercise program that included weekly customized counseling and support. The primary outcome was change from baseline in body weight in the 14:10 group. RESULTS: Of the 78 randomized participants, 60 (n = 30/group) completed 8 weeks. The LS mean change from baseline in weight in the 14:10 group was −8.5% (95% CI −9.6 to −7.4; P < 0.001) and −7.1% (−8.3 to −5.8; P < 0.001) in the 12:12 group (between group difference −1.4%; −2.7 to −0.2; P < 0.05). There was a statistically significant LS mean change from baseline to week 8 in FBG in the 14:10 group of −7.6 mg/dl (95% CI −15.1 to −0.1; P < 0.05) but not in the 12:12 group (−3.1 mg/dl, −10.0 to 3.7; P = NS). Both interventions resulted in a larger reduction in FBG in participants with elevated FBG (≥100 mg/dl) at baseline (both P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: In participants with obesity who completed 8 weeks of the 14:10 TRE schedule combined with a commercial weight loss program, there was statistically significant and clinically meaningful weight loss and improvements in FBG.","Peeke, Pamela M.; Greenway, Frank L.; Billes, Sonja K.; Zhang, Dachuan; Fujioka, Ken",Nutr Diabetes,770,16

Since stigma is created and reinforced by society—through in-person and online social interactions—referencing the novel coronavirus as the “Chinese virus” or “China virus” has the potential to create and perpetuate stigma. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to assess if there was an increase in the prevalence and frequency of the phrases “Chinese virus” and “China virus” on Twitter after the March 16, 2020, US presidential reference of this term. METHODS: Using the Sysomos software (Sysomos, Inc), we extracted tweets from the United States using a list of keywords that were derivatives of “Chinese virus.” We compared tweets at the national and state levels posted between March 9 and March 15 (preperiod) with those posted between March 19 and March 25 (postperiod). We used Stata 16 (StataCorp) for quantitative analysis, and Python (Python Software Foundation) to plot a state-level heat map. RESULTS: A total of 16,535 “Chinese virus” or “China virus” tweets were identified in the preperiod, and 177,327 tweets were identified in the postperiod, illustrating a nearly ten-fold increase at the national level. All 50 states witnessed an increase in the number of tweets exclusively mentioning “Chinese virus” or “China virus” instead of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) or coronavirus. On average, 0.38 tweets referencing “Chinese virus” or “China virus” were posted per 10,000 people at the state level in the preperiod, and 4.08 of these stigmatizing tweets were posted in the postperiod, also indicating a ten-fold increase. The 5 states with the highest number of postperiod “Chinese virus” tweets were Pennsylvania (n=5249), New York (n=11,754), Florida (n=13,070), Texas (n=14,861), and California (n=19,442). Adjusting for population size, the 5 states with the highest prevalence of postperiod “Chinese virus” tweets were Arizona (5.85), New York (6.04), Florida (6.09), Nevada (7.72), and Wyoming (8.76). The 5 states with the largest increase in pre- to postperiod “Chinese virus” tweets were Kansas (n=697/58, 1202%), South Dakota (n=185/15, 1233%), Mississippi (n=749/54, 1387%), New Hampshire (n=582/41, 1420%), and Idaho (n=670/46, 1457%). CONCLUSIONS: The rise in tweets referencing “Chinese virus” or “China virus,” along with the content of these tweets, indicate that knowledge translation may be occurring online and COVID-19 stigma is likely being perpetuated on Twitter.","Budhwani, Henna; Sun, Ruoyan",J Med Internet Res,770,16

The sample consisted of 24 science teachers recruited using criterion sampling, which is a purposive sampling method. A case study, which is a qualitative research method, was the design of choice. Data were collected through interviews, videotapes, and expert observations. The data were analyzed using inductive content analysis. Themes, categories, and codes were developed in accordance with the research purpose. Participants had positive opinions about the LSM, STEM education, and distance learning. Participants stated that the LSM activities within distance learning contributed to pedagogy and content knowledge in the STEM education process. The challenges faced by participants were unfavorable environmental conditions, time management issues, and a lack of knowledge and experience in lesson planning. Expert observations and videotapes corroborate these results, indicating that the LSM integrated with STEM education results in higher quality STEM lesson planning and teaching.

Thematic analysis was used to analyse the data. Three major themes were co-produced as essential care elements. These were: ‘My experience of healthcare’, ‘Care that I am confident in’ and ‘My journey through healthcare’. Through an IPPOSI partner project steering group and their membership groups’ contribution, these themes were further refined into a definition of person-centred coordinated care and nineteen related generic descriptors.

Under all scenarios of immune evasion, we find an increased transmissibility advantage for B.1617.2 against all previously circulating strains. Using an extended SIR model accounting for reinfections and wanning immunity, we produce evidence in support of how early public interventions in March 2021 would have helped to control transmission in the country.

However, numerous uncertainties exist regarding the pros and cons of vaccination, especially in patients with (immune-mediated) kidney diseases on immunosuppressive drugs. Here, members of the Immunonephrology Working Group (IWG) of the European Renal Association-European Dialysis and Transplant Association (ERA-EDTA) discuss thirteen frequently-asked questions regarding safety and efficacy of the most promising vaccine candidates. Post-marketing surveillance should be performed to estimate the rate of vaccine response (humoral and cellular) of different vaccine platforms, and surveillance of disease activity following administration of COVID-19 vaccines. Some of the candidates induce signaling pathways which also promote autoimmune kidney diseases, e.g. type I interferons in systemic lupus erythematosus. Efficacy estimates would thus far favor the use of selected COVID-19 vaccines, such as BNT162b2, mRNA-1273 or Gam-COVID-Vac. Humoral immune response after vaccination should be monitored using appropriate assays. Even in the absence of neutralizing antibodies patients might be protected by a sufficient cellular immune response capable to reduce severity of COVID-19. A reduced vaccine response after the use of CD20-depleting agents is anticipated, and it is particularly important to discuss strategies to improve vaccine response with these patients. Distancing and shielding measures remain important as not all vaccines fully protect from coronavirus infection.

However, there is no effective anti-viral therapy or licensed vaccines currently available for these human pathogens. The envelope glycoprotein (GP) of Ebola virus, which mediates entry into target cells, is cytotoxic and this effect maps to a highly glycosylated mucin-like region in the surface subunit of GP (GP1). However, the mechanism underlying this cytotoxic property of GP is unknown. To gain insight into the basis of this GP-induced cytotoxicity, HEK293T cells were transiently transfected with full-length and mucin-deleted (Δmucin) Ebola GP plasmids and GP localization was examined relative to the nucleus, endoplasmic reticulum (ER), Golgi, early and late endosomes using deconvolution fluorescent microscopy. Full-length Ebola GP was observed to accumulate in the ER. In contrast, GPΔmucin was uniformly expressed throughout the cell and did not localize in the ER. The Ebola major matrix protein VP40 was also co-expressed with GP to investigate its influence on GP localization. GP and VP40 co-expression did not alter GP localization to the ER. Also, when VP40 was co-expressed with the nucleoprotein (NP), it localized to the plasma membrane while NP accumulated in distinct cytoplasmic structures lined with vimentin. These latter structures are consistent with aggresomes and may serve as assembly sites for filoviral nucleocapsids. Collectively, these data suggest that full-length GP, but not GPΔmucin, accumulates in the ER in close proximity to the nuclear membrane, which may underscore its cytotoxic property.","Bhattacharyya, Suchita; Hope, Thomas J",Virol J,770,16

However, at no time it was used the desirable community perspective and community participation throughout the process as it has been successfully done in other settings. Subsequently, with the closure of health centers, it ceased to be provided in some autonomous communities, when all the attention was transferred to the hospital setting. This exacerbated hospital-centrism, to the detriment of PHC and Home Care, is showing a high contagion in healthcare professionals. The circulation of professionals in the hospitals, where the main focus of infection is concentrated, and from these to their homes is a clear risk factor. In addition, we must not forget that Home Care is of special importance for the care of people with terminal illnesses or very advanced chronic diseases (dementia, COPD ...), although always taking into account recommendations tending to extreme precautions for infection for professionals, family and caregivers. This can be adapted to the pandemic situation by using tools that digital health offers (telephone care, video calls ...). Finally, it would be very interesting that, once the crisis was over, research was carried out that allowed the incorporation of people who have been treated by the health service during the pandemic, through the technique called public participation in research projects.","Ramón Martínez Riera, José; Gras-Nieto, Elvira",Enferm Clin,770,16

In this context, documenting people’s behaviour changes, the impact of public health measures, and individuals’ knowledge, motivations, and beliefs – even their perception of how the crisis is being managed – is essential for understanding the experience of the population and adapting the management approach accordingly. This article presents findings and lessons on how to monitor a population’s behaviour during a crisis, obtained by reviewing forty-five surveys conducted in Belgium and France during the first Covid-19 stay-at-home order, from April to May 2020. The central message is to argue that the citizens’ role in this type of survey – and in managing the crisis, more generally – should be reconsidered by thinking of them as true health partners and members of a community that could be mobilised to help.","Pétré, Benoit; Kirkove, Delphine; de Andrade, Vincent; Crozet, Cyril; Toro-Arrocet, Daniela; Margat, Aurore; Gagnayre, Rémi",Patient Prefer Adherence,770,33

Based on a broad perspective—historical, social and political—we show how the development of a collective needs-conscious identity can lead to active protests on the part of social workers against their condition. This process is brought into sharp focus by critical analysis of media reports on the protests held by social workers in Israel in July 2020. An analysis of the struggle points to a number of factors that are responsible for its success: creating a collective consciousness with respect to the profession and the use of anger (as against fear); increasing the visibility of the profession in the public eye and the media; developing a dialogue that defined the party responsible for oppressing the status of the social workers; highlighting the ramifications of this oppression not only on the social workers but also on society as a whole; and using rhetoric that enabled the professional struggle to be ended and collaboration to be continued. The significance of these findings and their theoretical and practical implications are discussed.","Ben Shlomo, Shirley; Levin-Keini, Noga",Br J Soc Work,770,16

Objective: To estimate the CFR applying a delay-adjusted method across countries, exploring differences to simple methods and potential correlation to country level variables. Methods: Secondary analysis of publicly available data from countries with [≥]500 cases by April 30th. We calculated CFR adjusting for delay time from diagnosis to death and using simple methods for comparison. We performed a random effects meta-analysis to pooling CFRs for all countries and for those with high testing coverage and low positivity rate. We explored correlation of adjusted CFR with age structure and health care resources at country level. Results: We included 107 countries and the Diamond Princess cruise-ship. The overall delay adjusted CFR was 2.8% (95%CI: 2.1 to 3.1) while naive CFR was 5.1% (95%CI: 4.1 to 6.2). In countries with high testing coverage/low positivity rate the pooled adjusted CFR was 2.1% (95%CI: 1.5 to 3.0), there was a correlation with age over 65 years ({beta} = 0.12; 95%CI: 0.06 to 0.18), but not with number of physician or critical care beds. Naive method underestimated the CFR of the CFR with a median of 1.3% across countries. Conclusion: Our best estimation of CFR across countries is 2% and varies according to the aged population size. Modelers and policy makers may consider these results to assess the impact of lockdowns or other mitigation policies.","Canelo-Aybar, C.; Beltran, J.; Santero, M.; Alonso-Coello, P.",,770,21

The Korean city of Daegu endured the first large COVID-19 outbreak outside of China. Since the report of the first confirmed case in Daegu on February 18, 2020, a total of 6,880 patients have been reported until May 29, 2020. We experienced five patients with ischemic stroke and COVID-19 during this period in four tertiary hospitals in Daegu. The D-dimer levels were high in all three patients in whom D-dimer blood testing was performed. Multiple embolic infarctions were observed in three patients and suspected in one. The mean time from stroke symptom onset to emergency room arrival was 22 hours. As a result, acute treatment for ischemic stroke was delayed. The present case series report raises the possibility that the coronavirus responsible for COVID-19 causes or worsens stroke, perhaps by inducing inflammation. The control of COVID-19 is very important; however, early and proper management of stroke should not be neglected during the epidemic.","Kwon, Doo Hyuk; Do, Youngrok; Eun, Mi-Yeon; Lee, Jun; Park, Hyungjong; Sohn, Sung-Il; Hong, Jeong-Ho",J Korean Med Sci,770,12

The pathogen–host interaction after PEDV infection is still unclear. To investigate this issue, high-throughput-based sequencing technology is one of the optimal choices. In this study, we used in vitro transcription sequencing alternative polyadenylation sites (IVT-SAPAS) method, which allowed accurate profiling of gene expression and alternative polyadenylation (APA) sites to profile APA switching genes and differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in IPEC-J2 cells during PEDV variant strain infection. We found 804 APA switching genes, including switching in tandem 3′ UTRs and switching between coding region and 3′ UTR, and 1,677 DEGs in host after PEDV challenge. These genes participated in variety of biological processes such as cellular process, metabolism and immunity reactions. Moreover, 413 genes, most of which are the “focus” genes in interaction networks, were found to be involved in both APA switching genes and DEGs, suggesting these genes were synchronously regulated by different mechanisms. In summary, our results gave a relatively comprehensive insight into dynamic host–pathogen interactions in the regulation of host gene transcripts during PEDV infection.

However, the rapid dissemination of information has highlighted some issues with communication of scientific results and opinions in this time of heightened sensitivity and global concern. MAIN TEXT: Rapid publication of COVID-19 literature through expedited review, preprint publications and opinion pieces are important resources for the medical scientific community. Yet the risks of unverified information loom large in times when the healthcare community is desperate for information. Information that has not been properly vetted, or opinion pieces without solid evidence, may be used to influence public health policy decisions. We discuss three examples of unverified information and the consequences in this time of high anxiety surrounding COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: In an era when information can be widely and swiftly disseminated, it is important to ensure that the scientific community is not an inadvertent source of misinformation. This will require a multimodal approach, with buy-in from editors, publishers, preprint servers, authors and journalists. The landscape of medical publications has changed, and a collaborative approach is required to maintain a high standard of scientific communications.","Bagdasarian, N.; Cross, G.

Here, we sought to determine the prevalence of different respiratory viruses during asthma exacerbations. Systematic computerized searches of the literature up to June 2017 without language limitation were performed. The primary focus was on the prevalence of respiratory viruses, including AdV (adenovirus), BoV (bocavirus), CoV (coronavirus), CMV (cytomegalovirus), EnV (enterovirus), HSV (herpes simplex virus), IfV (influenza virus), MpV (metapneumovirus), PiV (parainfluenzavirus), RV (rhinovirus) and RSV (respiratory syncytial virus) during asthma exacerbations. We also examined the prevalence of viral infection stratified by age, geographic region, type of respiratory secretion, and detection method. Sixty articles were included in the final analysis. During asthma exacerbations, the mean prevalence of AdV, BoV, CoV, CMV, EnV, HSV, IfV, MpV, PiV, RV and RSV was 3.8%, 6.9%, 8.4%, 7.2%, 10.1%, 12.3%, 10.0%, 5.3%, 5.6%, 42.1% and 13.6%, respectively. EnV, MPV, RV and RSV were more prevalent in children, whereas AdV, BoV, CoV, IfV and PiV were more frequently present in adults. RV was the major virus detected globally, except in Africa. RV could be detected in both the upper and lower airway. Polymerase chain reaction was the most sensitive method for detecting viral infection. Our findings indicate the need to develop prophylactic polyvalent or polyvirus (including RV, EnV, IfV and RSV) vaccines that produce herd immunity and reduce the healthcare burden associated with virus-induced asthma exacerbations.

As of June 2020, gaps and longitudinal trends in the COVID-19 medical literature remain unidentified, despite potential benefits for research prioritisation and policy setting in both the COVID-19 pandemic and future large-scale public health crises. METHODS: In this paper, we searched PubMed and Embase for medical literature on COVID-19 between 1 January and 24 March 2020. We characterised the growth of the early COVID-19 medical literature using evidence maps and bibliometric analyses to elicit cross-sectional and longitudinal trends and systematically identify gaps. RESULTS: The early COVID-19 medical literature originated primarily from Asia and focused mainly on clinical features and diagnosis of the disease. Many areas of potential research remain underexplored, such as mental health, the use of novel technologies and artificial intelligence, pathophysiology of COVID-19 within different body systems, and indirect effects of COVID-19 on the care of non-COVID-19 patients. Few articles involved research collaboration at the international level (24.7%). The median submission-to-publication duration was 8 days (interquartile range: 4–16). CONCLUSIONS: Although in its early phase, COVID-19 research has generated a large volume of publications. However, there are still knowledge gaps yet to be filled and areas for improvement for the global research community. Our analysis of early COVID-19 research may be valuable in informing research prioritisation and policy planning both in the current COVID-19 pandemic and similar global health crises.","Liu, Nan; Chee, Marcel Lucas; Niu, Chenglin; Pek, Pin Pin; Siddiqui, Fahad Javaid; Ansah, John Pastor; Matchar, David Bruce; Lam, Sean Shao Wei; Abdullah, Hairil Rizal; Chan, Angelique; Malhotra, Rahul; Graves, Nicholas; Koh, Mariko Siyue; Yoon, Sungwon; Ho, Andrew Fu Wah; Ting, Daniel Shu Wei; Low, Jenny Guek Hong; Ong, Marcus Eng Hock",BMC Med Res Methodol,770,2

In Germany, where I am located we have meanwhile ended the lockdown phase and started reopening. In this Editorial, I will try to describe the different aspects of the changes for an Orthopaedic Surgeon in this second phase of reopening. As numbers are the main basis for decision-making in this pandemic, I will try to give you a bit of background information on them first. As situations differ depending on the country you live in, you as a reader are probably in a different situation than I am right now, but hopefully you will still get some useful information for your daily routine. Although the numbers have improved a lot, the pandemic is still affecting all aspects of our lives, therefore this editorial is again divided into 4 sections: Role as surgeon, as doctor, as teacher, and as family/society member. As of a few days ago in Germany elective surgeries are allowed to be performed again. Although processes in the OR are very similar to what we have been used to, outside the OR a lot has changed. Testing and patients, maintaining distance, wearing face masks the entire day and so on is heavily affecting our practice. Patients are still nervous to visit the doctor and enter the Hospital although a lot of them are in great pain and have restricted mobility. Even testing all of them is not diffusing the anxiety completely. Objective information by the media, the politicians and us is important to overcome this anxiety. The part of interdisciplinary work became a lot smaller in this phase of reopening. Still pathways and regulations need to be developed but now Orthopaedic work is again the centre of our day in the Hospital. In our role as teacher, we are meanwhile used to all those webinars and digital options of education. However, getting used to it does not mean that we don’t miss dearly the additional value of face to face discussions. We have further experienced that building up professional relationships and networks is not only based on facts but also on social factors. Something that we still miss. Reopening has improved life in families a lot. Grandchildren can meet their grandparents again and so on. This positive effect cannot be regarded high enough. Within the society reopening, however, is more demanding than the lockdown was. Protests and conspiracy theories are numerous and it is our mission as educated scientists to inform as many people around us as possible about the facts. Overall, it has to be stated, that all parts of our lives as Orthopaedic Surgeons remain affected by the Covid-19 pandemic. Life became better in a lot of ways; however, it is still a long way back to normal and we need to be patient.","Graichen, Heiko",J Orthop,770,11

One approach to rapid testing might be to consider the olfactory capacities of trained detection dogs in order to develop a non-invasive, rapid and cheap mass detection approach, through the Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) signature of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The goal of this study is to determine the individual values of sensitivity and specificity of trained dogs when performing olfactory detection of COVID-19 on axillary sweat samples. A group of 7 dogs was tested on a total of 218 samples (62 positive and 156 negative), completely unknown to the dogs, following a randomised and double-blinded protocol carried out on olfaction cone line-ups. To ensure a wide olfactory range as close as possible to operational conditions, the samples were retrieved from 13 different sites. Sensitivities vary from 87 to 94p100 for 6 dogs, and are above 90p100 for 3 of them. Only one dog, whose sensitivity was 60p100, was not selected to continue the study and enter the operational stage. Sensitivity results vary from 78 to 92p100, with 6 dogs over 85p100 and 4 over 90p100. Thanks to these results, a virtual approach of Positive and Negative Predilection Values (PPV and NPV) was designed, based on an almost perfect diagnostic tool as reference and for increasing prevalence values of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The studies to come on olfactory detection of COVID-19 by dogs will still face several challenges, but the accumulation of positive and encouraging results suggest that it may play an important part in mass COVID-19 pre-testing situations.","Grandjean, D.; Gallet, C.; Lecoq-Julien, C.; Sarkis, R.; Muzzin, Q.; Roger, V.; Roisse, D.; Dirn, N.; Levert, C.; Breton, E.; Galtat, A.; Forget, A.; Charreaudeau, S.; Gasmi, F.; Jean-Baptiste, C.; Petitjean, S.; Hamon, K.; Duquesne, J.-M.; Coudert, C.; Tourtier, J.-P.; Billy, C.; Wurtz, J.-M.; Chauvin, A.; Eyer, X.; Ziani, S.; Prevel, L.; Cherubini, I.; Khelili-Houas, E.; Hausfater, P.; Devillier, P.; Desquilbet, L.",,770,16

Longer term sequelae of COVID-19 infection includes lung fibrosis in a proportion of patients. Krebs von den Lungen 6 (KL-6) is a mucin like glycoprotein that has been proposed as a marker of pulmonary epithelial cell injury. We sought to determine whether KL-6 was a marker of 1) the severity of acute COVID-19 infection, or 2) the persistence of symptoms/radiological abnormalities at medium term follow up. METHODS: Prospective single centre observational study. RESULTS: Convalescent KL-6 levels were available for 93 patients (male 63%, mean age 55.8 years) who attended an 12-week follow up appointment after being admitted to hospital with COVID-19. For 67 patients a baseline KL-6 result was available for comparison. There was no significant correlations between baseline KL-6 and the admission CXR severity score or clinical severity NEWS score. Furthermore, there was no significant difference in the baseline KL-6 level and an initial requirement for oxygen on admission or the severity of acute infection as measured at 28 days. There was no significant difference in the 12-week KL-6 level and the presence or absence of subjective breathlessness but patients with abnormal CT scans at 12 weeks had significantly higher convalescent KL-6 levels compared to the remainder of the cohort (median 1101 IU/ml vs 409 IU/ml). CONCLUSIONS: The association between high KL-6 levels at 12 weeks and persisting CT abnormalities (GGO/fibrosis), is a finding that requires further exploration. Whether KL-6 may help differentiate those patients with persisting dyspnoea due to complications rather than deconditioning or dysfunctional breathing alone, is an important future research question.","Arnold, David T.; Donald, Charmaine; Lyon, Max; Hamilton, Fergus W.; Morley, Anna J.; Attwood, Marie; Dipper, Alexandra; Barratt, Shaney L.",PLoS One,770,16
