2226,Between Scylla and Charybdis: reconciling competing data management demands in the life sciences,2016-05-17,"BACKGROUND: The widespread sharing of biologicaConcluding Comments: Teaching Responsible Datal and biomedical data is recognised as a key element in facilitating translation of scientific discoveries into novel clinical applications and services. At the same time, twenty-first century states are increasingly concerned that this data could also be used for purposes of bioterrorism. There is thus a tension between the desire to promote the sharing of data, as encapsulated by the Open Data movement, and the desire to prevent this data from ‘falling into the wrong hands’ as represented by ‘dual use’ policies. Both frameworks posit a moral duty for life sciences researchers with respect to how they should make their data available. However, Open data and dual use concerns are rarely discussed in concert and their implementation can present scientists with potentially conflicting ethical requirements. DISCUSSION: Both dual use and Open data policies frame scientific data and data dissemination in particular, though different, ways. As such they contain implicit models for how data is translated. Both approaches are limited by a focus on abstract conceptions of data and data sharing. This works to impede consensus-building between the two ethical frameworks. As an alternative, this paper proposes that an ethics of responsible management of scientific data should be based on a more nuanced understanding of the everyday data practices of life scientists. Responsibility for these ‘micromovements’ of data must consider the needs and duties of scientists as individuals and as collectively-organised groups. SUMMARY: Researchers in the life sciences are faced with conflicting ethical responsibilities to share data as widely as possible, but prevent it being used for bioterrorist purposes. In order to reconcile the responsibilities posed by the Open Data and dual use frameworks, approaches should focus more on the everyday practices of laboratory scientists and less on abstract conceptions of data.","Bezuidenhout, Louise M.; Morrison, Michael",BMC Med Ethics,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4869374/,344
2493,Mapping internal connectivity through human migration in malaria endemic countries,2016-08-16,"Human mobility continues to increase in terms of volumes and reach, producing growing global connectivity. This connectivity hampers efforts to eliminate infectious diseases such as malaria through reintroductions of pathogens, and thus accounting for it becomes important in designing global, continental, regional, and national strategies. Recent works have shown that census-derived migration data provides a good proxy for internal connectivity, in terms of relative strengths of movement between administrative units, across temporal scales. To support global malaria eradication strategy efforts, here we describe the construction of an open access archive of estimated internal migration flows in endemic countries built through pooling of census microdata. These connectivity datasets, described here along with the approaches and methods used to create and validate them, are available both through the WorldPop website and the WorldPop Dataverse Repository.","Sorichetta, Alessandro; Bird, Tom J.; Ruktanonchai, Nick W.; zu Erbach-Schoenberg, Elisabeth; Pezzulo, Carla; Tejedor, Natalia; Waldock, Ian C.; Sadler, Jason D.; Garcia, Andres J.; Sedda, Luigi; Tatem, Andrew J.",Sci Data,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5127488/,344
2600,"Analysis of spatial mobility in subjects from a Dengue endemic urban locality in Morelos State, Mexico",2017-02-22,"INTRODUCTION: Mathematical models and field data suggest that human mobility is an important driver for Dengue virus transmission. Nonetheless little is known on this matter due the lack of instruments for precise mobility quantification and study design difficulties. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We carried out a cohort-nested, case-control study with 126 individuals (42 cases, 42 intradomestic controls and 42 population controls) with the goal of describing human mobility patterns of recently Dengue virus-infected subjects, and comparing them with those of non-infected subjects living in an urban endemic locality. Mobility was quantified using a GPS-data logger registering waypoints at 60-second intervals for a minimum of 15 natural days. RESULTS: Although absolute displacement was highly biased towards the intradomestic and peridomestic areas, occasional displacements exceeding a 100-Km radius from the center of the studied locality were recorded for all three study groups and individual displacements were recorded traveling across six states from central Mexico. Additionally, cases had a larger number of visits out of the municipality´s administrative limits when compared to intradomestic controls (cases: 10.4 versus intradomestic controls: 2.9, p = 0.0282). We were able to identify extradomestic places within and out of the locality that were independently visited by apparently non-related infected subjects, consistent with houses, working and leisure places. CONCLUSIONS: Results of this study show that human mobility in a small urban setting exceeded that considered by local health authority’s administrative limits, and was different between recently infected and non-infected subjects living in the same household. These observations provide important insights about the role that human mobility may have in Dengue virus transmission and persistence across endemic geographic areas that need to be taken into account when planning preventive and control measures. Finally, these results are a valuable reference when setting the parameters for future mathematical modeling studies.","Falcón-Lezama, Jorge Abelardo; Santos-Luna, René; Román-Pérez, Susana; Martínez-Vega, Ruth Aralí; Herrera-Valdez, Marco Arieli; Kuri-Morales, Ángel Fernando; Adams, Ben; Kuri-Morales, Pablo Antonio; López-Cervantes, Malaquías; Ramos-Castañeda, José",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5321279/,344
4220,Human core duplicon gene families: game changers or game players?,2019-09-16,"Illuminating the role of specific gene duplications within the human lineage can provide insights into human-specific adaptations. The so-called human core duplicon gene families have received particular attention in this respect, due to special features, such as expansion along single chromosomes, newly acquired protein domains and signatures of positive selection. Here, we summarize the data available for 10 such families and include some new analyses. A picture emerges that suggests broad functions for these protein families, possibly through modification of core cellular pathways. Still, more dedicated studies are required to elucidate the function of core-duplicons gene families and how they have shaped adaptations and evolution of humans.","Bekpen, Cemalettin; Tautz, Diethard",Brief Funct Genomics,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6920530/,344

The putative transgenic individuals were tested for the presence of ureB in the nuclear genome of rice plants by PCR analysis. Expression of ureB gene in rice plants was verified by RT-PCR and Western blot analysis using polyclonal human antiserum for transcription and translation levels respectively. These results provide a basis for further studies on the accumulation level of UreB recombinant protein in transgenic rice and potential utilization of transgenic rice for delivery of edible vaccines against Helicobacter pylori.","Gu, Qing; Han, Ning; Liu, Jianyi; Zhu, Muyuan",Biotechnol Lett,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7088001/,344

AIDS and SARS are examples. 2. Global alliances are emerging to protect health, especially fighting AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis. 3. In many millennium declarations, health was declared a worldwide development goal. 4. The international development cooperation for health is ailing everywhere despite three good reasons to make health a priority. 5. Good health supports good politics and national security. 6. The lack of security in health is an essential trap of poverty and increases population growth. 7. Health has essential macroeconomic benefits. Leading economists have made this clear. 8. Thus, health and education are true keys to social and economic development. Brains and bodies are the most essential factors of production. 9. “Empowerment in security creates opportunities”. This new motto underlines the strategic importance of health literacy and social health insurance. 10. International or global health is a leitmotiv of this decade of development. 11.

5291,Pattern formation of an epidemic model with diffusion,2012-01-28,"Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is the leading cause of infectious death in the world. Immune dysregulation during acute lung infection plays a role in lung injury and the systemic inflammatory response. Cytokines seem to be major players in severe lung infection cases. Here, we present a review of published papers in the last 3 years regarding this topic. The cytokine response during pneumonia is different in bacterial vs viral infections; some of these cytokines correlate with clinical severity scales such as CURB65 or SOFA. Treatment focused in the cytokine environment is an interesting area that could impact the prognosis of CAP. Some of the agents that have been studied as co-adjuvant therapy are corticosteroids, macrolides, and linezolid, but anyone of those have shown a clear or proven efficacy or have been recommended as a part of the standard of care for CAP. More studies designed to define the role of immunomodulatory agents, such as co-adjuvant therapy in pneumonia, are needed.","Rendon, Adrian; Rendon-Ramirez, Erick J.; Rosas-Taraco, Adrian G.",Curr Infect Dis Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7088528/,344
5309,Complex dynamic behavior in a viral model with state feedback control strategies,2014-04-02,"Part of the dorsal funiculus of the adult male rat (Wistar) spinal cord was treated for l h at the thoracolumbar level by running hot water, at approximately 48–50 ° C, through a polyethylene tube 2 mm in diameter in contact with the dura. Animals were fixed 1 day to 4 weeks later and the spinal cords were examined by light and electron microscopy. The affected area in the dorsal funiculus was approximately 1 mm long and less than 1 mm wide at the dorsal surface, and varied from 0.4 to 0.7 mm in depth. Within 3 days after treatment, almost all the myelin sheaths in the affected area were degraded, leaving the axons denuded, and at the same time astrocyte endfeet at the glial limiting membrane were swollen and partly destroyed. Almost all the denuded axons remained intact, exhibiting no noticeable morphological changes. There was evidence of a moderate vasogenic oedema, but minimal signs of haemorrhage in the lesion. Seven days after treatment, many immature Schwann cells but no oligodendrocytes were found between the denuded axons. By 2 weeks many of the denuded axons were remyelinated, and by 4 weeks almost all of those axons located near the pial and perivascular surfaces had been remyelinated by Schwann cells, while most of those located in the deep and marginal zones bordering the adjoining intact areas were remyelinated by oligodendrocytes. Longitudinal sections revealed that at nodes of Ranvier PNS-type myelin sheaths were apposed by either intact or newly formed CNS-type myelin sheaths. A typical glial limiting membrane was not reformed beneath the pial surface, but an inconspicuous one was found between the PNS- and CNS-type fibre areas.","Sasaki, Makoto; Ide, Chizuka",J Neurocytol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7088616/,344

8862,On the analysis of a multi-regions discrete SIR epidemic model: an optimal control approach,2016-03-07,"OBJECTIVES: Chronic diarrhoea and wasting are well recognized features of AIDS in Africa. However, because of resource constraints few ocmprehensive aetiological studies have conducted in sub-Saharan Africa which have included a broad range of microbiological investigations. We undertook a prospective cross-sectional study of adult patients admitted to a government hospital in Nairobi, Kenya, to determine possible bacterial, mycobacterial, parasitic and viral causes of diarrhoca; to consider which may be treatable; and to relate microbiological findings to clinical outcome. METHODS: Stool specimens from 75 consecutive HIV-seropositive patients with chronic diarrhoca admitted to a Nairobi hospital were subjected to microbiological investigation and results were compared with clinical findings and outcome. Stool samples were cultured for bacteria and mycobacteria and underwent light and electron microscopy; lawns of Escherichica coli were probed for pathogenic types and aliquots were tested for the presence of Clostridium difficile cytotoxin. Blood cultures for mycobacteria and other bacterial pathogens were performed as clinically indicated. RESULTS: Thirty-nine (52%) patients yielded putative pathogens, the most common being Cryptosporidium sp. (17%), Salmonella typhimurium (13%), and Mycobacterium tuberculosis (13%). Of 41 patients investigated for pathogenic Escherichia coli, enteroaggregative E. coli and diffusely adherent E. coli were each found in four patients. Thirty-one (41%) patients died. Detection of cryptosporidium cysts was the single most significant predictor of death (X(2) = 5.2, P<0.05). Many patients did not improve (21; 285) or self-discharged whilst still sick (5; 7%) but five (7%) were diagnosed ante mortem with tuberculosis and treated and a further 13 (17%) showed improvement by time of discharge. CONCLUSIONS: HIV-infected patients with chronic diarrhoea in Nairobi have a poor outcome overall, and even with extensive investigation a putative pathogen was identified in only just over half the patients. The most important step is to exclude tuberculosis: and the most useful investigation appears to be Ziehl-Neelsen staining. Other potentially treatable Gram-negative bacterial pathogens, S. typhimurium, Shigella sp. and adherent E. coli were, however, common but require culture facilities which are not widely accessible for definitive identification. Further studies focussing on simple ways to identify sub-groups of patients with treatable infections are warranted.","Mwachari, C.; Batchelor, B.I.F.; Paul, J.; Waiyaki, P.G.; Gilks, C.F.",J Infect,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7133614/,344

10081,Current issues and forthcoming events,2003-09-03,"The abilities of hybridization probes to detect all human adenovirus types and to identify enteric adenovirus types were evaluated. The efficiency of hybridization was compared to other tests currently in routine laboratory use on clinical specimens from young children with gastroenteritis, Probes were derived from various regions of the adenovirus types 2 and 41 genomes, and were evaluated by hybridization with a series of DNA quantities from 1 μg to 10 pg of one adenovirus type from each human subgenus, lambda phage, and HEp 2 cells. The sensitivity of hybridization with the HPII probe (92.7%), containing the conserved hexon gene, compared well with EM (54.6%), culture and neutralization (45.5%), and enzyme immunoassay (61.8%). The sensitivity of detection of enteric adenovirus isolates by the cloned Bg/II D fragment probe (92.9%) and by a synthetic probe (85.7%), manufactured from type‐specific sequences of the Ad41 hexon gene were comparable to Ad40/Ad41 specific enzyme immunoassay (84.6%). Hybridization was found to be a sensitive method of adenovirus detection in comparison to traditional methods of laboratory diagnosis. Synthetic oligonucleotides enable specific detection of individual enteric adenovirus types. Hybridization had additional advantages over other tests in identifying cases of infection with more than one adenovirus type and in allowing an estimate of the concentration of adenovirus in the specimen.","Scott‐Taylor, Tim H.; Ahluwalia, Gurmuk; Dawood, Magdy; Hammond, Gregory W.",J Med Virol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7166767/,344

10910,Tuning the overlap and the cross-layer correlations in two-layer networks: Application to a susceptible-infectious-recovered model with awareness dissemination,2018-03-09,"Several recent studies have tackled the issue of optimal network immunization by providing efficient criteria to identify key nodes to be removed in order to break apart a network, thus preventing the occurrence of extensive epidemic outbreaks. Yet, although the efficiency of those criteria has been demonstrated also in empirical networks, preventive immunization is rarely applied to real-world scenarios, where the usual approach is the a posteriori attempt to contain epidemic outbreaks using quarantine measures. Here we compare the efficiency of prevention with that of quarantine in terms of the tradeoff between the number of removed and saved nodes on both synthetic and empirical topologies. We show how, consistent with common sense, but contrary to common practice, in many cases preventing is better than curing: depending on network structure, rescuing an infected network by quarantine could become inefficient soon after the first infection.","Strona, Giovanni; Castellano, Claudio",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7217530/,344

Here, we demonstrate that CD8(+) T cell recognition of the naturally occurring MHC-I-restricted LCMV-associated immune escape variant Y4F is restored following vaccination with a proline-altered peptide ligand (APL). The APL increases MHC/peptide (pMHC) complex stability, rigidifies the peptide and facilitates T cell receptor (TCR) recognition through reduced entropy costs. Structural analyses of pMHC complexes before and after TCR binding, combined with biophysical analyses, revealed that although the TCR binds similarly to all complexes, the p3P modification alters the conformations of a very limited amount of specific MHC and peptide residues, facilitating efficient TCR recognition. This approach can be easily introduced in peptides restricted to other MHC alleles, and can be combined with currently available and future vaccination protocols in order to prevent viral immune escape.","Duru, Adil Doganay; Sun, Renhua; Allerbring, Eva B.; Chadderton, Jesseka; Kadri, Nadir; Han, Xiao; Peqini, Kaliroi; Uchtenhagen, Hannes; Madhurantakam, Chaithanya; Pellegrino, Sara; Sandalova, Tatyana; Nygren, Per-Åke; Turner, Stephen J.; Achour, Adnane",PLoS Pathog,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7224568/,344

Her case serves as the basis for a plea for modesty up and against the somewhat heroic conceptualizations of techno-moral change to date—less logos, less autos, more practice, more relationality. Rather than a displacement of these conceptualizations, I question whether Kamphof’s art of living offers only a different perspective: in scale (as a micro-event of techno-moral change), and in unit of analysis (as an art of living oriented to relations with others rather than the relation to the self).

Here, we identify an antirheumatic drug, auranofin (AUR) as a dual inhibitor of metallo-β-lactamases (MBLs) and mobilized colistin resistance (MCRs), two resistance enzymes that have distinct structures and substrates. We demonstrate that AUR irreversibly abrogates both enzyme activity via the displacement of Zn(II) cofactors from their active sites. We further show that AUR synergizes with antibiotics on killing a broad spectrum of carbapenem and/or COL resistant bacterial strains, and slows down the development of β-lactam and COL resistance. Combination of AUR and COL rescues all mice infected by Escherichia coli co-expressing MCR-1 and New Delhi metallo-β-lactamase 5 (NDM-5).

Recently, we observed a spontaneous bimodal variation in liver weight in C57BL/6JOlaHsd mice fed a semisynthetic diet. We now characterized the spontaneous variation in liver weight and its relationship with parameters of hepatic lipid and bile acid (BA) metabolism. In male C57BL/6JOlaHsd mice fed AIN-93G from birth to postnatal day (PN)70, we measured plasma BA, lipids, Very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL)-triglyceride (TG) secretion, and hepatic mRNA expression patterns. Mice were sacrificed at PN21, PN42, PN63 and PN70. Liver weight distribution was bimodal at PN70. Mice could be subdivided into two nonoverlapping groups based on liver weight: 0.6 SD 0.1 g (approximately one-third of mice, small liver; SL), and 1.0 SD 0.1 g (normal liver; NL; p<0.05). Liver histology showed a higher steatosis grade, inflammation score, more mitotic figures and more fibrosis in the SL versus the NL group. Plasma BA concentration was 14-fold higher in SL (p<0.001). VLDL-TG secretion rate was lower in SL mice, both absolutely (-66%, p<0.001) and upon correction for liver weight (-44%, p<0.001). Mice that would later have the SL-phenotype showed lower food efficiency ratios during PN21-28, suggesting the cause of the SL phenotype is present at weaning (PN21). Our data show that approximately one-third of C57BL/6JOlaHsd mice fed semisynthetic diet develop spontaneous liver disease with aberrant histology and parameters of hepatic lipid, bile acid and lipoprotein metabolism.

14730,Message from the Editor-in-Chief,2021-01-15,"BACKGROUND: With visceral leishmaniasis (VL) incidence at its lowest level since the 1960s, increasing attention has turned to early detection and investigation of outbreaks. METHODS: Outbreak investigations were triggered by recognition of case clusters in the VL surveillance system established for the elimination program. Investigations included ascertainment of all VL cases by date of fever onset, household mapping and structured collection of risk factor data. RESULTS: VL outbreaks were investigated in 13 villages in 10 blocks of 7 districts. Data were collected for 20,670 individuals, of whom 272 were diagnosed with VL between 2012 and 2019. Risk was significantly higher among 10–19 year-olds and adults 35 or older compared to children younger than 10 years. Outbreak confirmation triggered vector control activities and heightened surveillance. VL cases strongly clustered in tolas (hamlets within villages) in which > 66% of residents self-identified as scheduled caste or scheduled tribe (SC/ST); 79.8% of VL cases occurred in SC/ST tolas whereas only 24.2% of the population resided in them. Other significant risk factors included being an unskilled non-agricultural laborer, migration for work in a brick kiln, living in a kuccha (mud brick) house, household crowding, habitually sleeping outside or on the ground, and open defecation. CONCLUSIONS: Our data highlight the importance of sensitive surveillance with triggers for case cluster detection and rapid, careful outbreak investigations to better respond to ongoing and new transmission. The strong association with SC/ST tolas suggests that efforts should focus on enhanced surveillance in these disadvantaged communities.

It is characterized by a high level of basal Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER) stress, Unfolded Protein Response (UPR) activation and constitutive phosphorylation of oncogenic pathways such as the Signal Transducer and activator of Transcription (STAT3). In this study, we found that the inositol requiring kinase (IRE) 1alpha/X-box binding protein (XBP1) axis of UPR plays a key role in the survival of PEL cells, while double stranded RNA-activated protein kinase-like ER kinase (PERK) and activating transcription factor (ATF) 6 slightly influence it, in correlation with the capacity of the IRE1alpha/XBP1 axis to induce the release of interleukin (IL)-6, IL-10 and Vascular-Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF). Moreover, we found that IRE1alpha/XBP1 inhibition reduced STAT3 Tyr705 phosphorylation and induced a pro-survival autophagy in PEL cells. In conclusion, this study suggests that targeting the IRE1alpha/XBP1 axis represents a promising strategy against PEL cells and that the cytotoxic effect of this treatment may be potentiated by autophagy inhibition.","Gonnella, Roberta; Gilardini Montani, Maria Saveria; Guttieri, Luisa; Romeo, Maria Anele; Santarelli, Roberta; Cirone, Mara",Biomedicines,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7912693/,344

The impact of sedation strategy on outcome, particularly when delivered early after initiation of mechanical ventilation, is unknown. Evidence is increasing that volatile anaesthetic agents could be associated with better outcome. Their use in delirium prevention is unknown. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This study is an investigator-initiated, prospective, multicentre, two-arm, randomised, control, open-trial comparing inhaled sedation strategy versus intravenous sedation strategy in mechanically ventilated patients in ICU. Two hundred and fifty patients will be randomly assigned to the intravenous sedation group or inhaled sedation group, with a 1:1 ratio in two groups according to the sedation strategy. The primary outcome is the occurrence of delirium assessed using two times a day confusion assessment method for the ICU (CAM-ICU). Secondary outcomes include cognitive and functional outcomes at 3 and 12 months. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The study has been approved by the Regional Ethics Committee (CPP Ouest) and national authorities (ANSM).

Optimizing Childcare Functions for Different Parenting Characteristics,2021-04-05,"We find ourselves at our present crossroads with a well-traveled toolkit, perhaps too well worn but with aspirational hopes and dreams for the field of sleep neurotherapeutics. This volume is organized thematically into six topical domains that parallel the major subspecialty areas of contemporary clinical sleep neurology practice, as well as novel directions and opportunities. The issue begins with an overview of the central disorders of hypersomnolence, including narcolepsy, idiopathic hypersomnia and other hypersomnia disorders, and the related use of the entire broad range of stimulant and wake-promoting pharmacotherapies. Next, the range of behavioral therapies, application of light and light restriction and melatonin therapies, and hypnotic pharmacotherapies useful in insomnia and circadian sleep–wake rhythm disorders are reviewed, followed by an overview of treatment options for sleep-related breathing disorders including positive airway pressure and the novel approach of hypoglossal neurostimulation for obstructive sleep apnea. The parasomnias and sleep-related movement disorders, including NREM disorders of arousal, REM parasomnias (nightmares and isolated sleep paralysis and idiopathic/isolated REM sleep behavior disorder, and restless legs syndrome are then discussed, and the applications of sleep neurotherapeutics in sleep and neurological disease are reviewed, including neurodevelopmental, epileptic, autoimmune encephalopathies, and neurodegenerative diseases. Last, the novel directions and opportunities in sleep neurology offered by cannabinoid therapies and machine learning/artificial intelligence methodology conclude this comprehensive survey of contemporary sleep neurology. We hope that you find this volume to be a useful and inspirational support tool for the work that matters most, your care of all our sleep neurology patients in the clinics.

16973,Terminal Groups-Dependent Near-Field Enhancement Effect of Ti(3)C(2)T(x) Nanosheets,2021-04-12,"Zika virus (ZIKV) is a serious public health concern that may lead to neurological disorders in affected individuals. The virus can be transmitted from an infected mother to her fetus, via mosquitoes, or sexually. ZIKV infections are associated with increased risk for Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) and congenital microcephaly in newborns infected prenatally. Dysregulations of intracellular microRNAs (miRNAs) in infected neurons have been linked to different neurological diseases. To determine the potential role of miRNAs in ZIKV infection we developed a chronically infected neuroblastoma cell line and carried out differential expression analyses of miRNAs with reference to an uninfected neuroblastoma cell line. A total of 3192miRNAs were evaluated and 389 were found to be upregulated < 2-fold and 1291 were downregulated < 2-fold. In particular, we determined that hsa-mir-431-5p, hsa-mir-3687, hsa-mir-4655-5p, hsa-mir-6071, hsa-mir-762, hsa-mir-5787, and hsa-mir-6825-3p were significantly downregulated, ranging from -5711 to -660-fold whereas, has-mir-4315, hsa-mir-5681b, hsa-mir-6511a-3p, hsa-mir-1264, hsa-mir-4418, hsa-mir-4497, hsa-mir-4485-3p, hsa-mir-4715-3p, hsa-mir-4433-3p, hsa-mir-4708-3p, hsa-mir-1973 and hsa-mir-564 were upregulated, ranging from 20-0.8-fold. We carried out target gene alignment of these miRNAs with the ZIKV genome to predict the function of the differentially expressed miRNAs and their potential impact on ZIKV pathogenesis. These miRNAs might prove useful as novel diagnostic or therapeutic markers and targets for further research on ZIKV infection and neuronal injury resulting from ZIKV infectivity in developing fetal brain neurons.","Bagasra, Omar; Shamabadi, Narges Sadat; Pandey, Pratima; Desoky, Abdelrahman; McLean, Ewen",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8049460/,344
17216,Introduction for special issue: Antiviral immunity in invertebrates,2021-04-30,"Biallelic inactivating mutations in IL21R causes a combined immunodeficiency that is often complicated by cryptosporidium infections. While eight IL-21R-deficient patients have been reported previously, the natural course, immune characteristics of disease, and response to hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) remain to be comprehensively examined. In our study, we have collected clinical histories of 13 patients with IL-21R deficiency from eight families across seven centers worldwide, including five novel patients identified by exome or NGS panel sequencing. Eight unique mutations in IL21R were identified in these patients, including two novel mutations. Median age at disease onset was 2.5 years (0.5–7 years). The main clinical manifestations were recurrent bacterial (84.6%), fungal (46.2%), and viral (38.5%) infections; cryptosporidiosis-associated cholangitis (46.2%); and asthma (23.1%). Inflammatory skin diseases (15.3%) and recurrent anaphylaxis (7.9%) constitute novel phenotypes of this combined immunodeficiency. Most patients exhibited hypogammaglobulinemia and reduced proportions of memory B cells, circulating T follicular helper cells, MAIT cells and terminally differentiated NK cells. However, IgE levels were elevated in 50% of IL-21R-deficient patients. Overall survival following HSCT (6 patients, mean follow-up 1.8 year) was 33.3%, with pre-existing organ damage constituting a negative prognostic factor. Mortality of non-transplanted patients (n = 7) was 57.1%. Our detailed analysis of the largest cohort of IL-21R-deficient patients to date provides in-depth clinical, immunological and immunophenotypic features of these patients, thereby establishing critical non-redundant functions of IL-21/IL-21R signaling in lymphocyte differentiation, humoral immunity and host defense against infection, and mechanisms of disease pathogenesis due to IL-21R deficiency. Outcome following HSCT depends on prior chronic infections and organ damage, which should thus be considered as early as possible following molecular diagnosis.

17638,Cohort Profile: Research Advancement through Cohort Cataloguing and Harmonization (ReACH),2020-12-25,"BACKGROUND: Frequent retesting for HIV among persons at increased risk of HIV infection is critical to early HIV diagnosis of persons and delivery of combination HIV prevention services. There are few evidence-based interventions for promoting frequent retesting for HIV. We sought to determine the effectiveness of financial incentives and deposit contracts in promoting quarterly HIV retesting among adults at increased risk of HIV. METHODS AND FINDINGS: In peri-urban Ugandan communities from October to December 2018, we randomized HIV–negative adults with self-reported risk to 1 of 3 strategies to promote HIV retesting: (1) no incentive; (2) cash incentives (US$7) for retesting at 3 and 6 months (total US$14); or (3) deposit contracts: participants could voluntarily deposit US$6 at baseline and at 3 months that would be returned with interest (total US$7) upon retesting at 3 and 6 months (total US$14) or lost if participants failed to retest. The primary outcome was retesting for HIV at both 3 and 6 months. Of 1,482 persons screened for study eligibility following community-based recruitment, 524 participants were randomized to either no incentive (N = 180), incentives (N = 172), or deposit contracts (N = 172): median age was 25 years (IQR: 22 to 30), 44% were women, and median weekly income was US$13.60 (IQR: US$8.16 to US$21.76). Among participants randomized to deposit contracts, 24/172 (14%) made a baseline deposit, and 2/172 (1%) made a 3-month deposit. In intent-to-treat analyses, HIV retesting at both 3 and 6 months was significantly higher in the incentive arm (89/172 [52%]) than either the control arm (33/180 [18%], odds ratio (OR) 4.8, 95% CI: 3.0 to 7.7, p < 0.001) or the deposit contract arm (28/172 [16%], OR 5.5, 95% CI: 3.3 to 9.1, p < 0.001). Among those in the deposit contract arm who made a baseline deposit, 20/24 (83%) retested at 3 months; 11/24 (46%) retested at both 3 and 6 months. Among 282 participants who retested for HIV during the trial, three (1%; 95%CI: 0.2 to 3%) seroconverted: one in the incentive group and two in the control group. Study limitations include measurement of retesting at the clinic where baseline enrollment occurred, only offering clinic-based (rather than community-based) HIV retesting and lack of measurement of retesting after completion of the trial to evaluate sustained retesting behavior. CONCLUSIONS: Offering financial incentives to high-risk adults in Uganda resulted in significantly higher HIV retesting. Deposit contracts had low uptake and overall did not increase retesting. As part of efforts to increase early diagnosis of HIV among high-risk populations, strategic use of incentives to promote retesting should receive greater consideration by HIV programs.

They typically range in size from 30 to 150 nm in diameter. An exosome’s surfaces can be bioengineered with antibodies, fluorescent dye, peptides, and tailored for small molecule and large active biologics. Exosomes have enormous potential as a drug delivery vehicle due to enhanced biocompatibility, excellent payload capability, and reduced immunogenicity compared to alternative polymeric-based carriers. Because of active targeting and specificity, exosomes are capable of delivering their cargo to exosome-recipient cells. Additionally, exosomes can potentially act as early stage disease diagnostic tools as the exosome carries various protein biomarkers associated with a specific disease. In this review, we summarize recent progress on exosome composition, biological characterization, and isolation techniques. Finally, we outline the exosome’s clinical applications and preclinical advancement to provide an outlook on the importance of exosomes for use in targeted drug delivery, biomarker study, and vaccine development.","Huda, Md Nurul; Nafiujjaman, Md; Deaguero, Isaac G.; Okonkwo, Jude; Hill, Meghan L.; Kim, Taeho; Nurunnabi, Md",ACS Biomater Sci Eng,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8147457/,344
17973,A Diffusive Sveir Epidemic Model with Time Delay and General Incidence,2021-06-01,"Introduction: Enteric fever, a systemic infection caused by Salmonella enterica Typhi and S. enterica Paratyphi is one of the most common infections in developing countries such as Nepal. Aside from irrational practices of antibiotic use, mutations in chromosomal genes encoding DNA gyrase and Topoisomerase IV and by plasmid mediated quinolone resistant (PMQR) genes are suggested mechanisms for the development of resistance to nalidixic acid and reduced susceptibility to ciprofloxacin. Regardless of high endemicity of enteric fever in Nepal, there is paucity of studies on prevalence and drug-resistance of the pathogen. Therefore, this study aimed to assess the antibiotic susceptibility pattern of Salmonella isolates and determine the minimum inhibitory concentration of ciprofloxacin. Methods: A total of 1298 blood samples were obtained from patients with suspected enteric fever, attending Sukraraj Tropical and Infectious Disease Hospital (STIDH) during March–August, 2019. Blood samples were inoculated immediately into BACTEC culture bottles and further processed for isolation and identification of Salmonella Typhi and S. Paratyphi. Axenic cultures of the isolates were further subjected to antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) by using the modified Kirby–Bauer disc diffusion method based on the guidelines by CLSI. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of ciprofloxacin was determined by agar-dilution method. Results: Out of 1298 blood cultures, 40 (3.1%) were positive for Salmonella spp. among which 29 (72.5%) isolates were S. Typhi and 11 (27.5%) isolates were S. Paratyphi A. In AST, 12.5% (5/40), 15% (6/40) and 20% (8/40) of the Salmonella isolates were susceptible to nalidixic acid, ofloxacin and levofloxacin, respectively, whereas none of the isolates were susceptible to ciprofloxacin. The MIC value for ciprofloxacin ranged from 0.06-16 µg/mL in which, respectively, 5% (2/40) and 52.5% (21/40) of the isolates were susceptible and resistant to ciprofloxacin. None of the isolates showed multidrug-resistance (MDR) in this study. Conclusion: This study showed high prevalence of quinolone-resistant Salmonella spp., while there was marked re-emergence of susceptibilities to traditional first option drugs. Hence, conventional first-line-drugs and third-generation cephalosporins may find potential usage as the empirical drugs for enteric fever. Although our reporting was free of MDR strains, extensive surveillance, augmentation of diagnostic facilities and treatment protocol aided by AST report are recommended for addressing the escalating drug-resistance in the country.","Maharjan, Anu; Dhungel, Binod; Bastola, Anup; Thapa Shrestha, Upendra; Adhikari, Nabaraj; Banjara, Megha Raj; Lekhak, Binod; Ghimire, Prakash; Rijal, Komal Raj",Infect Dis Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8167555/,344

There is a growing concern that the number of women needing treatment for advanced breast cancer is rising at an unprecedented rate in Nigeria. AIM: To assess the caregiver burden and its associated factors amongst family caregivers of women with advanced breast cancer. SETTING: The study was conducted at the radiation oncology clinic of the University College Hospital, Ibadan, Nigeria. METHODS: A cross-sectional descriptive study was conducted amongst 157 eligible family caregivers of women with advanced breast cancer. The family caregivers completed an interviewer-administered questionnaire, which included the socio-demographic data, the caregiving process and the Zarit Burden Interview (ZBI). Logistic regression was used to identify factors, and ethical approval was obtained. RESULTS: Over half (53%) of the respondents were males with spousal caregivers dominantly constituting 27.4% of all respondents, closely followed by daughters (25.5%) of the care recipients. The mean ZBI score was 29.84 ± 13.9. Most (72%) of the caregivers experienced burden. Factors associated with caregiver burden were previous hospitalisation of the care recipient (odds ratio [OR] = 3.74, confidence interval [CI]: 1.67 to 8.38) and perceived dysfunction in patients activities of daily living (OR = 2.57, CI: 1.14 to 5.78). CONCLUSION: Family caregivers of women with advanced breast cancer experience burden of care.

19232,The Economics of Viagra Revisited: The Price Is Right,2021-06-01,"Diabetic kidney disease (DKD) has been the leading cause of chronic kidney disease for over 20 years. Yet, over these two decades, the clinical approach to this condition has not much improved beyond the administration of glucose-lowering agents, renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system blockers for blood pressure control, and lipid-lowering agents. The proportion of diabetic patients who develop DKD and progress to end-stage renal disease has remained nearly the same. This unmet need for DKD treatment is caused by the complex pathophysiology of DKD, and the difficulty of translating treatment from bench to bed, which further adds to the growing argument that DKD is not a homogeneous disease. To better capture the full spectrum of DKD in our design of treatment regimens, we need improved diagnostic tools that can better distinguish the subgroups within the condition. For instance, DKD is typically placed in the broad category of a non-inflammatory kidney disease. However, genome-wide transcriptome analysis studies consistently indicate the inflammatory signaling pathway activation in DKD. This review will utilize human data in discussing the potential for redefining the role of inflammation in DKD. We also comment on the therapeutic potential of targeted anti-inflammatory therapy for DKD.","Jung, Su Woong; Moon, Ju-Young",Korean J Intern Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8273831/,344

Previous studies have shown such detection can be obtained with a separate gas concentrator and a sensor device using zeolites and oxide semiconductors of WO(3) nanoparticles. By applying the gas concentrator, porous molecular structures alter both the gas sensitivity and the selectivity, and even can be used to define the sensor characteristics. Based on such a gas sensor design, we investigated the properties of an array of three sensors made of a layer of WO(3) nanoparticles coated with zeolites with different interactions between gas molecule adsorption and desorption. The array was tested with four volatile organic compounds, each measured at different concentrations. The results confirm that the features of individual zeolites combined with the hybrid gas sensor behavior, along with the differences among the sensors, are sufficient for enabling the discrimination of volatile compounds when disregarding their concentration.","Park, Jongyoon; Tabata, Hitoshi",ACS Omega,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8387996/,344
21059,Nursing Leadership for 21st Century,2021-08-30,"BACKGROUND: Dexmedetomidine promotes normal sleep architecture; the drug also improves analgesia. We therefore tested the hypothesis that supplementing intravenous analgesia with dexmedetomidine reduces delirium in older patients recovering from orthopedic surgery. METHODS: In this double-blinded randomized controlled trial, we enrolled 712 older (aged 65–90 years) patients scheduled for major orthopedic surgery. Postoperative analgesia was provided by patient-controlled intravenous sufentanil, supplemented by randomly assigned dexmedetomidine (1.25 μg/mL) or placebo, for up to three days. The primary outcome was the incidence of delirium assessed twice daily with the Confusion Assessment Method. Among secondary outcomes, pain severity was assessed twice daily and sleep quality once daily, each with an 11-point scale where 0 = no pain/the best possible sleep and 10 = the worst pain/the worst possible sleep. RESULTS: The incidence of postoperative delirium was 7.3% (26 of 354) with placebo and 4.8% (17 of 356) with dexmedetomidine; relative risk 0.65, 95% CI 0.36 to 1.18; P = 0.151. Dexmedetomidine reduced pain both at rest (median difference -1 to 0 points, P ≤ 0.001) and with movement (-1 points, P < 0.001) throughout the first 5 postoperative days; it also improved subjective sleep quality during the first 3 postoperative days: day one median difference -1 point (95% CI -1 to 0), P = 0.007; day two 0 point (-1 to 0), P = 0.010; and day three 0 point (-1 to 0), P = 0.003. The incidence of adverse events was similar in each group. CONCLUSIONS: Supplementing sufentanil intravenous analgesia with low-dose dexmedetomidine did not significantly reduce delirium, but improved analgesia and sleep quality without provoking adverse events.

The abaR gene was knocked out in ATCC 17978 strain using homologous recombination method. The growth curve and biofilm formation were measured in the wild type and abaR gene knockdown strains. Transcriptome sequencing was performed in the wild type and abaR gene knockdown strains following 8 h of culture. The growth curve in the abaR gene knockdown strain was similar to that of the wild-type strain. Biofilm formation significantly declined in the abaR gene knockdown strain at 8 and 48 h after culture. A total of 137 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were obtained including 20 downregulated DEGs and 117 upregulated DEGs. Genes with differential expression were closely related to viral procapsid maturation (GO:0046797), acetoin catabolism (GO:0045150), carbon metabolism (ko01200), and the glycolysis/gluconeogenesis (ko00010)-related pathways. The results of the eight verified expression DEGs were consistent with the results predicted by bioinformatics.

In this study, we sought to characterize facilitators and barriers to optimal RHD treatment with BPG in Sudan. METHODS: We conducted a mixed-methods study, collecting survey data from 397 patients who were enrolled in a national RHD registry between July and November 2017. The cross-sectional surveys included information on demographics, healthcare access, and patient perspectives on treatment barriers and facilitators. Factors associated with increased likelihood of RHD treatment adherence to prophylactic BPG were assessed by using adjusted logistic regression. These data were enhanced by focus group discussions with 20 participants, to further explore health system factors impacting RHD care. RESULTS: Our quantitative analysis revealed that only 32% of the study cohort reported optimal prophylaxis adherence. Younger age, reduced primary RHD healthcare facility wait time, perception of adequate health facility staffing, increased treatment costs, and high patient knowledge about RHD were significantly associated with increased odds of treatment adherence. Qualitative data revealed significant barriers to RHD treatment arising from health services factors at the health system level, including lack of access due to inadequate healthcare staffing, lack of faith in local healthcare systems, poor ancillary services, and patient lack of understanding of disease. Facilitators of RHD treatment included strong interpersonal support. CONCLUSIONS: Multiple patient and system-level barriers to RHD prophylaxis adherence were identified in Khartoum, Sudan. These included patient self-efficacy and participant perception of healthcare facility quality. Strengthening local health system infrastructure, while enhancing RHD patient education, may help to improve treatment adherence in this vulnerable population.

We have studied viral evolution at population level (competition on the same receptor) and at species level (competitions on different receptors). During the HIV infection, several mutants of the virus arise, which are able to use different chemokine receptors, in particular the CCR5 and CXCR4 coreceptors (termed R5 and X4 phenotypes, respectively). Phylogenetic inference of chemokine receptors suggests that virus mutational pathways may generate R5 variants able to interact with a wide range of chemokine receptors different from CXCR4. Using the chemokine tree topology as conceptual framework for HIV viral speciation, we present a model of viral phenotypic mutations from R5 to X4 strains which reflect HIV late infection dynamics. Our model investigates the action of Tumor Necrosis Factor in AIDS progression and makes suggestions on better design of HAART therapy.","Sguanci, Luca; Liò, Pietro; Bagnoli, Franco",Computational Methods in Systems Biology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7119952/,344

Unfortunately, many older patients’ final days are spent in the ICU; 40 % of Medicare patients who die are admitted to an ICU during their terminal illness, accounting for 25 % of all Medicare expenditures. Additionally, of those who survive, many are discharged to a subacute facility with persistent organ failure where they will eventually die. Furthermore, those discharged to a subacute care facility have a higher mortality rate compared to those discharged home (31 vs. 17 %). The decision to admit an elderly patient to an ICU should be based not only on their comorbidities, acuity of illness, and prehospital functional status, including quality of life, but also on their preference for the use of life-sustaining treatments if it is known. The underlying disease process is not altered despite the use of invasive procedures in terminally ill patients, and potential harm or discomfort can occur if invasive procedures are used inappropriately. To avoid such unintended consequences and enhance optimal end-of-life decision making, healthcare providers need to identify, explain, and negotiate consensus therapeutic goals.","Schwartz, Steven J.; Sieber, Frederick",Manual of Geriatric Anesthesia,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7120603/,344

For example, records from the fifth century B.C. suggest that influenza pandemics were observed in ancient Greece. In Europe, during the Middle Ages and the Renaissance, numerous concordant reports from different countries describe epidemics of respiratory infections that resemble influenza pandemics. However, it is not possible to be certain that these epidemics were due to influenza. In the twentieth century, three influenza pandemics have occurred, including the deadly Spanish flu pandemic. Modern virology has unravelled the mechanisms of emergence of pandemic viruses, and considerable knowledge on influenza viruses has been accumulated. The picture is now clear: influenza A is a zoonotic virus whose reservoir is in wild birds. In rare cases, these avian viruses are introduced into man and, eventually, become pandemic viruses. Although these mechanisms are now understood, the time frame required for adaptation of the avian virus to its new host remains unknown. Maybe the next pandemic will show us how rapid this adaptation can be.","Lina, Bruno",Paleomicrobiology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7121287/,344

However, significant improvements in ICU and in-hospital survival of cancer patients in ICU have been demonstrated in studies in recent years [1–4]. Risk factors for mortality have shifted from those related to the underlying condition to those related to the severity of acute illness similar to other critically-ill patients. Neutropenia per se and the underlying malignancy (solid and hematological) do not have an impact on the outcome of patients in ICU. Recent chemotherapy is associated rather with improved survival [3, 5–7], while organ dysfunction, severity of disease scores, need for vasopressor treatment, need for mechanical ventilation immediately or after noninvasive ventilation, no definite diagnosis and a non-infectious diagnosis are associated with mortality [1–3, 8]. Invasive aspergillosis is also associated with very high mortality rates in ICU (see below). In several studies, admission to ICU in the early stages of sepsis or other acute event was associated with better survival than admission later, after development of organ dysfunction. Performance status is perhaps the most important and only variable relating to the underlying condition that is correlated with ICU death. The prognosis remains guarded for certain cancer patients, including patients after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) with active uncontrolled graft versus host disease, those with relapse of the primary disease after allogeneic HSCT and special cases of solid cancer including pulmonary carcinomatous lymphangitis and carcinomatous meningitis with coma [9].","Humphreys, Hilary; Winter, Bob; Paul, Mical",Infections in the Adult Intensive Care Unit,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7121735/,344

We then focused on the stereo-array isotope-labeling (SAIL) method, one of our recent accomplishments, which culminates the isotope-aided NMR technologies for structural studies of proteins from various aspects: accurate structural determinations of large proteins, elaboration for automated structural determination, highly efficient and versatile residue-selective methyl labeling with newly developed auxotrophic E. coli strains, large-amplitude slow-breathing motion (LASBM) as revealed by the aromatic ring flipping of the residues in ligand-binding interfaces, and applications of the deuterium-induced (13)C-NMR isotope shift to investigate the hydrogen exchange phenomena of side-chain polar groups. Meanwhile, the expected role of NMR spectroscopy has been rapidly shifting from structure determinations to dynamics studies of biologically interesting targets, such as membrane proteins and larger protein complexes. The dynamic aspects of protein–protein and protein–ligand interactions are closely related to their biological functions and can be efficiently studied by using proteins residue selectively labeled with amino acids bearing optimized labeling patterns, prepared by cellular expression. We are absolutely confident that biological NMR spectroscopy will continually develop with further innovations of isotope-labeling technologies in the coming era, featuring ultrahigh field spectrometers beyond 1 GHz.","Kainosho, Masatsune; Miyanoiri, Yohei; Takeda, Mitsuhiro",Experimental Approaches of NMR Spectroscopy,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7122432/,344
25940,Etiquette with Chinese Characteristics,2016-11-12,"The transboundary diseases in camel are mainly linked to the regional camel meat market from Sahelian countries (from Mauritania to Somalia) to the Arabian peninsula and North Africa. Indeed, the camel flow in relationship with this market is based on live animals’ export. Because the camel trade can be formal and informal with interconnections between both sectors and despite veterinary controls in the main exporting ports, some diseases such as Rift Valley fever (RVF), PPR-like disease, and MERS-coronavirus can spread from exporting countries to importing ones. However, the epidemiological status of these different diseases is quite variable and the transmission to humans in case of zoonosis (RVF and MERS-Cov) is not necessarily due to transboundary camel trade despite the impact of outbreak on the regional camel market. Globally, dromedary camel is less affected than other ruminants by infectious diseases under transboundary surveillance. But, because camel breeding is concentrated in countries where the disease surveillance systems often lack means, where the frontiers in desert areas are often “porous,” and where the herd mobility is difficult to assess, the risk of transboundary diseases’ transmission through borders is not negligible. Nowadays, the challenge of TADs control is limited to Rift Valley fever, but special attention must be paid to emerging diseases, including the recent discovery of prion disease in Algeria.","Faye, Bernard",Transboundary Animal Diseases in Sahelian Africa and Connected Regions,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7122668/,344

A large body of theoretical work has been devoted to modeling disease emergence, and critical factors that predict outbreak occurrence and severity have been proposed. In this chapter, we focus on biological factors that underlie both theoretical models and urban planning. We describe the SARS 2002–2003 pandemic as a case study of epidemic control of a human infectious disease. We then describe theoretical analyses of disease dynamics and control strategies. An important conclusion is that epidemic control will be strongly dependent on particular aspects of pathogen biology including host breadth, virulence, incubation time, and/or mutation rate. The probability, and potential cost, of future outbreaks, may be high and lessons from both past cases and theoretical work should inform urban design and policy. Interdisciplinary collaboration in planning, swiftness of information dissemination and response, and willingness to forgo personal liberties during a crisis may be key factors in resilience to infectious disease outbreaks.","Kawashima, Kent; Matsumoto, Tomotaka; Akashi, Hiroshi",Urban Resilience,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7122892/,344

Classical microbiological methods in general seek to define the common features of specific bacterial groups as a means of classification and identification of microbes. Thus, the focus was to describe the common features which discriminated closely related groups of organisms. In contrast, the newer molecular methods often seek to expand the classification of microbes not only as a means to organize microbial phylogeny but also to differentiate signatures between microbes identified within a species in greater detail. Molecular biology tools are used both as an adjunct to established methods and as replacement for classical methods for detection, discrimination, or identification of bacterial and viral species.","Jackman, Joany",Chemical and Physical Signatures for Microbial Forensics,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7123343/,344

Cerebrospinal fluid analysis usually shows lymphocytic pleocytosis but, unlike viral or bacterial encephalitis, no evidence of direct CNS infection is found. There are no biologic markers of the disease and cerebral magnetic resonance imaging is essential to ADEM diagnosis, detecting diffuse or multifocal asymmetrical lesions throughout the white matter on T2- and FLAIR-weighted sequences.

Phosphoprotein (P) is known to play pivotal roles in the life cycle of RABV, and has been regarded as a prime target for inhibitors of viral replication. This study aimed to carry out intracellular administration of a kind of P-binding peptide for RABV inhibition. A group of reported P-binding peptides were focused on for activity improvement by quantitative structure–activity relationship (QSAR) method, and then were mediated by cell penetrating peptide (CPP) for intracellular activity evaluation. The QSAR models had good performance in reliability and predictability (R(2) ≥ 0.852, Q(2) ≥ 0.601, [Formula: see text] ≥ 0.595), and the peptide screened by partial least squares (PLS) QSAR model (R(2) = 0.994, Q(2) = 0.937, [Formula: see text] = 0.981) exhibited even higher antiviral activity when it was delivered into the cells by CPP.

However, the negative transfer may occur during the adaptive process due to differences in data distribution between domains. Besides, it is difficult to achieve a fine-grained alignment of relation category without fully mining the multi-mode data structure. Furthermore, as a common application scenario, partial domain adaptation (PDA) refers to domain adaptive behavior when the relation class set of a specific domain is a subset of the related domain. In this case, some outliers belonging to the related domain will reduce the performance of the model. To solve these problems, a novel model based on a multi-adversarial module for partial domain adaptation (MAPDA) is proposed in this study. We design a weight mechanism to mitigate the impact of noise samples and outlier categories, and embed several adversarial networks to realize various category alignments between domains. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed model significantly improves the state-of-the-art performance of relation extraction implemented in domain adaptation.","Cao, Xiaofei; Yang, Juan; Meng, Xiangbin",The Semantic Web,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7250590/,344

Much of the evidence for NSEs comes from observational studies with a high risk of bias, and there is a clear need for new data from randomized controlled trials. Recently, it was proposed that rabies vaccine has protective NSEs in people and in animals. The aim of the proposed study is to determine whether rabies vaccine reduces the incidence rate of episodes of common infectious disease syndromes in a population of veterinary students on the island of St. Kitts. METHODS: The trial design is a single-site, two-arm, parallel-group, participant-blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled, two-sided comparative study, with an internal pilot study for blinded sample size re-estimation. Allocation to study arm is by block randomization stratified by sex within cohort with a 1:1 allocation ratio. The primary study outcome is the number of new weekly episodes of common infectious diseases including respiratory, diarrheal and febrile illnesses. A vaccine immunogenicity ancillary study is planned. DISCUSSION: Demonstration of a non-specific protective effect of rabies vaccine against unrelated respiratory, gastrointestinal and febrile illnesses would provide supportive evidence for the design of similar studies in children in populations with a high burden of these illnesses.

The multisignature size in our construction is the same as that of a single signature. The verification of a multisignature can be performed with the aggregated public key and the verifier gets convinced that the message has been signed by all the signers. More positively, our aggregated public key size is also the same as that of a single signer. Additionally, we extend our multisignature to an accountable subgroup multisignature (ASM) that permits any subset of potential signers to sign a common message with the property that the signature reveals the identities of the signers to any verifier. Our ASM scheme enjoys the same efficiency as that of our MS scheme without incurring any loss in the security reduction. We design our schemes in the plain public key model where there is no need to verify individual public keys. Our constructions are built in the standard lattice and are proven to be secure under the hardness of the short integer solution (SIS) problem in the random oracle model.","Kansal, Meenakshi; Dutta, Ratna",Progress in Cryptology - AFRICACRYPT 2020,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7334998/,344

Objective 2: To assess whether online versions of SKY and/or Health Enhancement Program (HEP) result in improvement in self-rated measures of insomnia, anxiety, depression, and resilience. TRIAL DESIGN: This is an open-label feasibility randomized controlled trial (RCT), comparing an online breath based yogic intervention SKY versus an online control mind-body intervention HEP in frontline hospital and long-term care home staff managing the COVID-19 pandemic. PARTICIPANTS: Participants will include frontline hospital and long-term care home staff that are involved in the management of COVID-19 patients in London, Ontario, Canada. Participants will be willing and able to attend via online video conferencing software to participate in the study interventions. Participants must have an adequate understanding of English and be able to sit without physical discomfort for 60 minutes. INTERVENTION AND COMPARATOR: Sudarshan Kriya Yoga (SKY): The online version of SKY will be delivered by at least one certified Canadian SKY teacher, with at least one back up teacher at all times, under the supervision of Ms. Ronnie Newman, Director of Research and Health Promotion, Art of Living Foundation, USA. The online version of SKY for healthcare workers has a total duration of 3 hours. Phase I will consist of 5 self-paced online modules of 4-10 minutes each to learn the breath control techniques. Participants will be sent an online survey in REDCap requesting that they self-confirm completion of the Phase I modules. In Phase II, 2 interactive online sessions of 1 hour each will be held on consecutive days with a certified SKY teacher, during which participants will learn the fast, medium and slow breaths. For ease of scheduling, multiple time windows will be offered for Phase II. There will be at least one back up teacher at all times. Both Phase I and II will be completed in the first week. Health Enhancement Program (HEP): The active control arm, HEP, will consist of time-matched online self-paced modules for Phase I. Phase II will consist of mindfulness-based meditation sessions delivered by mental health staff. HEP will be an active treatment program that incorporates mind-body interventions. HEP will consist of time-matched online self-paced modules with psychoeducation on healthy active living as well as interactive modules comprising of guided de-stressing exercises including music therapy, mindfulness and progressive muscle relaxation. Weekly follow up sessions will be offered to all recruited participants for 30 minutes each for the subsequent 4 weeks in both study arms. MAIN OUTCOMES: The following feasibility outcomes will be measured at the end of the study: (1) rate of participant recruitment, (2) rate of retention, (3) completeness of data entry, (4) cost of interventions, and (5) unexpected costs. Such measures will be collected on a daily basis through-out the study and tabulated 5 weeks later at the end of the study. RANDOMISATION: Participants will be randomized after they have electronically signed the consent form and the research staff have confirmed eligibility.

37006,Construction of Confidence Interval for a Univariate Stock Price Signal Predicted Through Long Short Term Memory Network,2020-07-22,"Replication is a common technique to build reliable and scalable systems. Traditional strong consistency maintains the same total order of operations across replicas. This total order is the source of multiple desirable consistency properties: integrity, convergence and recency. However, maintaining the total order has proven to inhibit availability and performance. Weaker notions exhibit responsiveness and scalability; however, they forfeit the total order and hence its favorable properties. This project revives these properties with as little coordination as possible. It presents a tool called [Formula: see text] that given a sequential object with the declaration of its integrity and recency requirements, automatically synthesizes a correct-by-construction replicated object that simultaneously guarantees the three properties. It features a relational object specification language and a syntax-directed analysis that infers optimum staleness bounds. Further, it defines coordination-avoidance conditions and the operational semantics of replicated systems that provably guarantees the three properties. It characterizes the computational power and presents a protocol for recency-aware objects. [Formula: see text] uses automatic solvers statically and embeds them in the runtime to dynamically decide the validity of coordination-avoidance conditions.

In this study, we analyzed the vaccine adverse event reporting system (VAERS) data to determine whether the facial paralysis reporting rate is higher in those who received influenza vaccination compared with those who received other vaccines. METHODS: We evaluated reports of facial paralysis in people who received influenza vaccination during January 2015 to October 2019 using Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities Preferred Terms. A disproportionality analysis was performed to determine the proportional reporting ratio (PRR), Chi-square statistic, and reporting odds ratio (ROR) with 95% confidence interval (CI). The demographic and clinical characteristics of the cases were also analyzed. RESULTS: Two hundred fifty cases of facial paralysis following influenza vaccination were reported during the study period. The median age of the patients was 45 (interquartile range, 30–57) years; 132 (52.8%) patients were females. The majority of the patients received the injected trivalent or quadrivalent seasonal influenza vaccine by intramuscular route. The PRR, Chi-square statistic, and ROR (95% CI) was 2.44, 122.32, and 2.44 (2.08–2.88), respectively; on excluding cases involving concomitant paresis/paralysis of limbs or Guillain–Barre syndrome, the disproportionality statistics were 2.30, 89.37, and 2.30 (1.93–2.75), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Our study shows increased reporting of facial paralysis following influenza vaccination as compared with other vaccines. Considering the inherent limitations of the VAERS database analysis, and the fact that disproportionality measures only indicate the presence of a signal, our study findings need to be explored in well-designed prospective pharmacoepidemiologic studies.","Kamath, Ashwin; Maity, Nivedita; Nayak, Manel Arjun",Clin Drug Investig,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7371962/,344

The analysis applies a locally weighted regression method (Lowess curve fitting) to time‐series data on weekly initial and continuing unemployment claims. Other measures of labor market outcomes are also included in the analysis. The findings suggest that while baseline conditions were relatively stable, the pandemic has generated an increase in unemployment in Nevada, and a steep rise in the number of unemployed workers covered by unemployment insurance. However, the largest growth in initial weekly unemployment claims may have already occurred. In addition, given the weight of leisure and hospitality in overall nonfarm employment, workers in that sector have been at elevated risk for unemployment. It is also possible that Latino and Asian workers will experience higher levels of unemployment. Finally, the study suggests that a history of inadequate financing has undermined the administrative capacity of the state's unemployment agency, with attendant consequences for its ability to process new claims.

K. pneumoniae-infected A549 cells were treated with different concentrations of an autophagy inhibitor or promoter for different time periods to assess the level of autophagy. Western blot analysis and immunofluorescence staining showed that K. pneumoniae could induce autophagy by A549 cells. With an increase in bacterial concentration and time of infection, autophagy gradually increased. The autophagy inhibitor significantly downregulated, while the promoter upregulated, expression of the autophagy-related protein LC3-II.

39163,From the Editor's Desk...,2020-09-15,"[Image: see text] Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is the worst pandemic disease of the current millennium. This disease is caused by the highly contagious severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which first exhibited human-to-human transmission in December 2019 and has infected millions of people within months across 213 different countries. Its ability to be transmitted by asymptomatic carriers has put a massive strain on the currently available testing resources. Currently, there are no clinically proven therapeutic methods that clearly inhibit the effects of this virus, and COVID-19 vaccines are still in the development phase. Strategies need to be explored to expand testing capacities, to develop effective therapeutics, and to develop safe vaccines that provide lasting immunity. Nanoparticles (NPs) have been widely used in many medical applications, such as biosensing, drug delivery, imaging, and antimicrobial treatment. SARS-CoV-2 is an enveloped virus with particle-like characteristics and a diameter of 60–140 nm. Synthetic NPs can closely mimic the virus and interact strongly with its proteins due to their morphological similarities. Hence, NP-based strategies for tackling this virus have immense potential. NPs have been previously found to be effective tools against many viruses, especially against those from the Coronaviridae family. This Review outlines the role of NPs in diagnostics, therapeutics, and vaccination for the other two epidemic coronaviruses, the 2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) virus and the 2012 Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) virus. We also highlight nanomaterial-based approaches to address other coronaviruses, such as human coronaviruses (HCoVs); feline coronavirus (FCoV); avian coronavirus infectious bronchitis virus (IBV); coronavirus models, such as porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), and transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV); and other viruses that share similarities with SARS-CoV-2. This Review combines the salient principles from previous antiviral studies with recent research conducted on SARS-CoV-2 to outline NP-based strategies that can be used to combat COVID-19 and similar pandemics in the future.","Medhi, Riddhiman; Srinoi, Pannaree; Ngo, Nhat; Tran, Hung-Vu; Lee, T.

The potent disinfectant activity of ozone against anaerobic bacteria was utilized during the World War I but, for the next six decades, there was no progress, which came only thanks to a few clinicians, who believed in its usefulness. A major advance came with the work of Dr. H. Wolff (1927–1980) and an Austrian surgeon, Dr. O. Rokitansky, who, in an empirical way, showed the efficacy of the ozonated autohaemotherapy in often avoiding limb amputation in patients with chronic limb ischemia. However the lack of basic research and randomized clinical trials relegated ozone therapy in the field of complementary medicine with a few and nebulous ideas of how ozone could act.","Bocci, Velio",OZONE,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7498868/,344

DPCM 4/3/2020 has established rules to contain the virus, the ASL task force and VS adopted and adapted them for a protected vaccination activity. Results Surgeries are cleaned more frequently and fomites have been removed. The rules were published on the ASL website, social networks, displayed on posters posted before entering the clinic and waiting rooms: vigilantes lets you enter without crowding the waiting room; only one parent enters; the adult enters alone; if you have a cough or sneeze cover your nose and mouth with a tissue or ask for the surgical mask, wash your hands with the disinfectant gel, sit only in the spaced chair. Inside the children find a nice poster with drawings to explain how to avoid the virus to be colored at home. Health care workers wear masks designed to calm children.

40810,Grey Rhino als Risiko,2020-10-15,"Carried by the tide of increasing digitalization in the health care system, novel telemedical applications are continually being developed, presented, and hyped—before disappearing again in most cases. Many of these applications fail to become established in the market because they cannot easily be integrated into existing structures, neither in terms of technical aspects nor in terms of workflows. One hurdle is represented by the lack of an established framework for the telemedical infrastructure. Nevertheless, precisely this aspect provides good examples of how it would be possible to build upon established standards to work internally and externally without complex interfaces. The well-established DICOM standard for medical imaging data represents a good basis. As imaging data are required in many areas of medicine, discipline- and institution-wide communication of these data rapidly attains a level sufficient to justify implementation of systems for image exchange. With a monthly exchange of 50,000 examinations between 450 collaborators, the network of the Westdeutscher Teleradiologieverbund (West German Teleradiology Association) demonstrates the rationality of telemedical cooperation, which can be superior to traditional means involving creation and sending of CDs. Examining the individual process components, it is possible to elucidate which requirements patient electronic health records must fulfil in order to become established. In addition to financing, these include interoperability and an immediate improvement for the involved parties in terms of treatment quality and resource allocation.","Kremers, M.",MKG-Chirurg,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7545155/,344

Mangaluru city and its surrounding areas in southwestern India are endemic to malaria with Plasmodium vivax being the most widespread and prevalent species although P. falciparum also frequently infects. However, no information is available on the level of protective immunity in this population. In this regard, a prospective hospital-based study was performed in malarial patients to assess antibody responses against the 19-kDa C-terminal portion of P. vivax and P. falciparum MSP-1 (MSP-1(19)). Serum samples from 51 healthy endemic controls and 267 infected individuals were collected and anti-MSP-1(19) antibody levels were analyzed by ELISA. The possible association between the antibody responses and morbidity parameters such as malarial anemia and thrombocytopenia was investigated. Among the 267 infected cases, 144 had P. vivax and 123 had P. falciparum infections. Significant levels of anti-MSP-1(19) antibody were observed both in P. vivax (123/144; 85.4%) and P. falciparum (108/123; 87.9%) infected individuals. In both type of infections, the major antibody isotypes were IgG1 and IgG3. The IgG levels were found to be increased in patients with severe anemia and thrombocytopenia. The antibody levels were also higher in infected individuals who had several previous infections, although antibodies produced during previous infections were short lived. The predominance of cytophilic anti-MSP-1(19) IgG1 and IgG3 antibodies suggests the possibility of a dual role of Pv MSP-1(19) and Pf MSP-1(19) during malarial immunity and pathogenesis.","Punnath, Kishore; Dayanand, Kiran K.; Midya, Vishal; Chandrashekar, Valleesha N.; Achur, Rajeshwara N.; Kakkilaya, Srinivas B.; Ghosh, Susanta K.; Kumari, Suchetha N.; Gowda, D.

Pertanto, adottare misure preventive di igiene e di distanziamento sociale è cruciale, a maggior ragione in questa categoria di soggetti. A sostegno dei pazienti con diabete sono state intraprese molteplici iniziative al fine di garantire la continuità assistenziale, tra cui la proroga della validità dei piani terapeutici per i farmaci ipoglicemizzanti, le procedure per il rinnovo della patente di guida e l’attivazione di servizi di telemedicina. In caso di infezione da COVID-19 e sintomi lievi è possibile una gestione domiciliare della persona con diabete, raccomandando un attento monitoraggio glicemico. Il paziente diabetico che necessita di ospedalizzazione richiede una gestione multidisciplinare che includa il diabetologo, con l’obiettivo di mantenere un adeguato controllo glicemico in assenza di ipoglicemie.

While necessary, these changes may have significant impact on the training of neurosurgery residents. METHODS: A survey assessing changes to resident clinical and educational workload and their sentiment about how these changes may affect their careers was distributed electronically to neurosurgery residents in the United States and Canada. RESULTS: One hundred ninety-seven resident responses were collected between April 17, 2020 and April 30, 2020. The survey respondents were spread over 29 states and Canada and were evenly spread across all residency levels (P = .619). Nearly 82% reported that the inpatient and outpatient volumes were either greatly (44.0%) or moderately (37.8%) reduced. Greater than 91% reported a significant reduction in work hours and a significant increase in resident didactics (P < .001). Nearly all residents surveyed (98.5%) reported that their program had converted to electronic platforms for their didactic lectures, and there was a significant increase in the time residents spent in didactic lectures. Residents reported converting the majority of their time outside of neurosurgery clinical responsibilities into watching remote didactic lectures, conducting research, and preparing for board examinations, while nearly 14% of trainees spent at least a portion of that time providing COVID-19 medical care. Senior residents were more likely to express concern about their educational experience as well as their future career prospects. CONCLUSION: Universally, residents have experienced reduced work hours and operative case volumes. Programs have adapted by increasing didactic time and using electronic platforms. The findings suggest that senior residents may feel the effects more than their junior counterparts. This may require more acute attention from faculty with respect to preparing senior residents for moving on to fellowship or ultimate job. It is possible that this remarkable time period will prompt a critical re-appraisal of the pre-COVID-19 adequacy of educational content in our training programs, and that enhanced educational efforts driven by this pandemic may be lasting.","Pelargos, Panayiotis E; Zhao, Yan; Smith, Zachary A; Dunn, Ian F; Bauer, Andrew M",Neurosurgery,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7717368/,344

Twitter data (N=82,893) related to both older adults and COVID-19 and dated from January 23rd to May 20th, 2020, were analyzed. Classification of tweets involved supervised machine learning. Latent Dirichlet Allocation was used to identify dominant themes in public discourse using, accompanied by a qualitative thematic analysis. Sentiment analysis was conducted based on the NRC Emotion Lexicon. The most common category in the coded tweets was “personal opinions” (66.2%), followed by “informative” (24.7%), “jokes/ridicule” (4.8%), and “personal experiences” (4.3%). More than one in ten (11.5%) tweets implied that the life of older adults is less valuable or downplayed the pandemic because it mostly harms older adults. A small proportion (4.6%) explicitly supported the idea of just isolating older adults. Almost three-quarters (72.9%) within “jokes/ridicule” targeted older adults, half of which were “death jokes.” The daily average of ageist content was 18%, with the highest of 52.8% on March 11th, 2020. We extracted 14 themes, such as perceptions of lockdown and risk. A bivariate Granger causality test suggested that informative tweets regarding at-risk populations increased the prevalence of tweets that downplayed the pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic has exposed and intensified ageism in our society. Information about COVID-19 on Twitter influenced public perceptions of risk and acceptable ways of controlling the pandemic.

Both the modalities are aimed at improving the strategies to deal with and optimize the allostatic response to environmental stressors and exposome. This allows to reduce the dysfunctional adaptive behavior patterns, which underlie many neuropsychological symptoms and pathologies, and to improve the symptoms of depression, anxiety and stress. MATERIALS AND METHODS: From a population of subjects experiencing at least two of the three symptoms depression, anxiety and stress, the selection of pre and post-treatment Depression, Anxiety, Stress 21 items scale (DASS 21) data was made proceeding with a reverse chronological recruitment mechanism, until reaching 150 subjects for each of the 2 groups. The first group was treated with the neuro psycho physical optimization treatment (NPPO), which is the punctiform modality of administration on the auricle pavilion, and the second group was treated with the neuro psycho physical optimization treatment, which is the area modality of administration applied by the planar probe on the cervicobrachial area (NPPO-CB). RESULTS: The Wilcoxon signs test confirmed the differences in scores in pre and post-treatment DASS-21. The comparison between the two groups data and the comparison across groups data showed that NPPO and NPPO-CB have the same efficacy in reducing the symptoms of depression, anxiety and stress, after a single treatment cycle. Statistical significance was set at p <0.05. DISCUSSION: This is the first efficacy descriptive comparison between the two different modalities of administration of the NPPO treatment, as different options for the same clinical indication.","Pinheiro Barcessat, Ana Rita; Nolli Bittencourt, Marina; Góes Gonçalves, Rebeca; Goncalves de Oliveira Cruz, Ana Vitoria; Coelho Pereira, José Alfredo; Bechelli, Fabio Augusto; Rinaldi, Arianna",Psychol Res Behav Manag,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7762445/,344

The outbreak of novel corona virus 2019 (COVID-19) has been treated as a Public Health crisis of global Concern by the World Health Organization (WHO). Various outbreak models for COVID-19 are being utilized by researchers throughout the world to get well-versed decisions and impose significant control measures. Amid the standard methods for COVID-19 worldwide epidemic prediction, easy statistical, as well as epidemiological methods have got more consideration by researchers and authorities. One main difficulty in controlling the spreading of COVID-19 is the inadequacy and lack of medical tests for detecting as well as identifying a solution. To solve this problem, a few statistical-based advances are being enhanced and turn into a partial resolution up-to some level. To deal with the challenges of the medical field, a broad range of intelligent based methods, frameworks, and equipment have been recommended by Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning. As ML and DL have the ability of identifying and predicting patterns in complex large datasets, they are recognized as a suitable procedure for producing effective solutions for the diagnosis of COVID-19. In this paper, a perspective research has been conducted in the applicability of intelligent systems such as ML, DL and others in solving COVID-19 related outbreak issues. The main intention behind this study is (i) to understand the importance of intelligent approaches such as ML and DL for COVID-19 pandemic, (ii) discussing the efficiency and impact of these methods in the prognosis of COVID-19, (iii) the growth in the development of type of ML and advanced ML methods for COVID-19 prognosis,(iv) analyzing the impact of data types and the nature of data along with challenges in processing the data for COVID-19,(v) to focus on some future challenges in COVID-19 prognosis to inspire the researchers for innovating and enhancing their knowledge and research on other impacted sectors due to COVID-19.","Nayak, Janmenjoy; Naik, Bighnaraj; Dinesh, Paidi; Vakula, Kanithi; Rao, B.

We aimed to derive and validate a clinical score to predict long-term mortality in patients with CAP discharged from a general ward. In this retrospective observational study, we derived a clinical risk score from 315 CAP patients discharged from the Internal Medicine ward of Cuneo Hospital, Italy, in 2015–2016 (derivation cohort), which was validated in a cohort of 276 patients discharged from the pneumology service of the Barakaldo Hospital, Spain, from 2015 to 2017, and from two internal medicine wards at the Turin University and Cuneo Hospital, Italy, in 2017. The main outcome was the 18-month follow-up all-cause death. Cox multivariate analysis was used to identify the predictive variables and develop the clinical risk score in the derivation cohort, which we applied in the validation cohort. In the derivation cohort (median age: 79 years, 54% males, median CURB-65 = 2), 18-month mortality was 32%, and 18% in the validation cohort (median age 76 years, 55% males, median CURB-65 = 2). Cox multivariate analysis identified the red blood cell distribution width (RDW), temperature, altered mental status, and Charlson Comorbidity Index as independent predictors.

It has the potential properties as the antiviral and antibacterial application. Its seed contain thymoquinone (TQ), thymohydroquinone (THQ), thymol (THY), p-cymene as major and other minor components. TQ and THQ exhibit broad spectrum of antimicrobial properties against the activity of bacteria, viruses, parasites, schistosoma and fungi. This work provides credence to the fabrication of antibacterial nanofibrous membrane by electrospinning machine from N. sativa extract with polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) solution for wound dressing. The morphology of the developed membrane is also characterized using scanning electron microscope. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) data has been showed that the functional groups of N. sativa are present in the prepared PVA-N. sativa nanofibrous membrane and its antibacterial activity was investigated. The disk diffusion method has been used to evaluate the antibacterial activity of PVA-N. sativa nanofibrous membrane against Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) bacteria and the inhibition zone with a value of 10 mm is formed. Considering the inherent properties of N. sativa, a conceptual reaction mechanism has been proposed to deactivate the viral proteins by the action of TQ and THQ.","Shahid, Md Abdus; Rahim, Abdur; Chowdhury, Mohammad Asaduzzaman; Kashem, Mohammad Abul",ADV TRADIT MED (ADTM),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7804899/,344

Citing national security, states subject foreign investments to new scrutiny, even unwinding mergers. The provision of 5G has become a diplomatic battleground—Huawei at its center. Meanwhile, states invoke national security to excuse trade wars. The USA invoked the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade national security exception to impose steel and aluminum tariffs, threatening more on automotive parts. Russia invoked that provision to justify its blockade of Ukraine, as did Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates to excuse theirs of Qatar. And with the spread of COVID-19, states are invoking national security to scrutinize supply lines. Multiplying daily, such stories have led some observers to dub the era one of geoeconomics. Nonetheless, these developments remain difficult to judge, and the relationship between economics and national security remains confused and slippery. The essay seeks clarity in the deeper logic of these labels, revealing a fundamental choice between the logics of markets and the logics of state. Whether invoked to ‘secure’ borders, privacy, health, the environment, or jobs, ‘national security’ is a claim about the proper location of policymaking. Appeals to economics, with their emphasis on global welfare and global person-to-person relationships, are such claims as well. Resolving disputes, this essay argues, requires recognizing these root choices.","Cohen, Harlan Grant",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7798975/,344

Recent work on graded modal types augments and refines this notion, enabling fine-grained, quantitative specification of data use in programs. The information provided by graded modal types appears to be useful for type-directed program synthesis, where these additional constraints can be used to prune the search space of candidate programs. We explore one of the major implementation challenges of a synthesis algorithm in this setting: how does the synthesis algorithm efficiently ensure that resource constraints are satisfied throughout program generation? We provide two solutions to this resource management problem, adapting Hodas and Miller’s input-output model of linear context management to a graded modal linear type theory. We evaluate the performance of both approaches via their implementation as a program synthesis tool for the programming language Granule, which provides linear and graded modal typing.","Hughes, Jack; Orchard, Dominic",Logic-Based Program Synthesis and Transformation,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7880237/,344

And several images in semantic irrelevance are usually needed to represent more secret message bits, which are easy to cause the attacker’s attention and bring some insecurity. To solve these two problems, a coverless video steganography method based on inter frame combination is proposed in this manuscript. In the proposed method, the hash sequence of a frame is generated by the CNNs and hash generator. To hide more information bits in one video, a special mapping rule is proposed. Through this mapping rule, some key frames in one video are selected. In the selected frames, one or several frames are used to represent a piece of information with equal length. To quickly index out the corresponding frames, a three-level index structure is proposed in this manuscript. Since the proposed coverless video steganography method does not embed one bit in video, it can effectively resist steganalysis algorithms. The experimental results and analysis show that the proposed method has a large capacity, good robustness and high security.","Zou, Liming; Wan, Wenbo; Wei, Bin; Sun, Jiande",Geometry and Vision,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7971785/,344

Therefore, this study was intended to examine the factors influencing on the intention to use Korean telemedicine services from the perspective of potential consumers in China and Vietnam as a pavement basic work to expand Korean telemedicine services overseas. To this end, the UTAUT2 model was reconstructed to be suitable for the study on the acceptance of telemedicine service; users’ perceived perception on Korean telemedicine services (i.e. performance expectancy, effort expectancy, social influence, price value, perceived risk) and personal characteristics (i.e. innovativeness and concern for health) were set as main variables; and their relationship with the use intention was empirically analyzed. As a result of the analysis, it was found that, performance expectancy, social influence, price value, and perceived risk factors, except for effort expectancy, have a significant relationship influencing on the use intention. In addition, it was confirmed that innovativeness and concern for health have a moderating effect on the relationship between performance expectancy and use intention.

49253,The Impact of Brexit on the Relations of UK Universities with East Asia,2021-01-10,"Form validators based on regular expressions are often used on digital forms to prevent users from inserting data in the wrong format. However, writing these validators can pose a challenge to some users. We present Forest, a regular expression synthesizer for digital form validations. Forest produces a regular expression that matches the desired pattern for the input values and a set of conditions over capturing groups that ensure the validity of integer values in the input. Our synthesis procedure is based on enumerative search and uses a Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT) solver to explore and prune the search space. We propose a novel representation for regular expressions synthesis, multi-tree, which induces patterns in the examples and uses them to split the problem through a divide-and-conquer approach. We also present a new SMT encoding to synthesize capture conditions for a given regular expression. To increase confidence in the synthesized regular expression, we implement user interaction based on distinguishing inputs. We evaluated Forest on real-world form-validation instances using regular expressions. Experimental results show that Forest successfully returns the desired regular expression in 70% of the instances and outperforms Regel, a state-of-the-art regular expression synthesizer.","Ferreira, Margarida; Terra-Neves, Miguel; Ventura, Miguel; Lynce, Inês; Martins, Ruben",Tools and Algorithms for the Construction and Analysis of Systems,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7979175/,344

We propose a solution to this bridging problem for the widely used class of population-structured Markov jump processes. The method is based on a state-space lumping scheme that aggregates states in a grid structure. The resulting approximate bridging distribution is used to iteratively refine relevant and truncate irrelevant parts of the state-space. This way, the algorithm learns a well-justified finite-state projection yielding guaranteed lower bounds for the system behavior under endpoint constraints. We demonstrate the method’s applicability to a wide range of problems such as Bayesian inference and the analysis of rare events.","Backenköhler, Michael; Bortolussi, Luca; Großmann, Gerrit; Wolf, Verena",Tools and Algorithms for the Construction and Analysis of Systems,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7979204/,344
49284,The International Aid Architecture,2020-06-18,"In the post genomic era, the finding of new therapeutic targets has hugely been accelerated by the use of bioinformatics tools. The availability of genome sequences of pathogenic microbes has led to an increased finding of genes and proteins that could be potential targets for drug or vaccine design. The tools made available by bioinformatics have played a central role in the analysis of the genome and protein sequences for finding immunogenic proteins among the repertoire possessed by the organisms. The methods for prediction of immunogenicity are automated, and the whole proteome can be analyzed to find the top candidates that could have immunity inducing properties. Not only finding of immunogenic proteins has been achieved, but the mapping of the individual epitopes is also being done. The availability of methods for finding T and B cell epitopes can lead to the design of epitope-based vaccines. The description of different bioinformatics tools that are available for determining the immunogenic properties, finding of T and B cell epitopes, and in silico tools that are used in vaccine design is given in here. An account of epitope-based vaccine design employing bioinformatics methods reported in the literature is discussed. There are many shortcomings associated with these methods, which are discussed in the chapter. As is the case with other bioinformatics methods, there exist issues of prediction accuracy. Achievement of higher accuracy in predictions and their translation into in vivo/in vitro conditions still requires improvement. The chapter intends to provide the list of freely accessible software for epitope prediction and vaccine design with their merits/demerits and also throwing light on their applicability in vaccine research.","Slathia, Parvez Singh; Sharma, Preeti",Computer-Aided Drug Design,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7979208/,344

An Application to Digital Payments,2020-12-06,"This chapter provides the context in which the book “Counting the Cost of COVID-19 on Global Tourism Industry” is written, including highlights for what follows in the rest of the book. The COVID-19 pandemic came when the world was in the midst of entertaining major global development agendas that had implications on the global tourism value chains. Among such major global development agendas, one could list the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and its aligned 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), the Paris Agreement, the Sendai Framework and Habitat III’s New Urban Agenda. The pandemic also steered geopolitical and global economic tensions as key players, including individuals and countries, demanded answers as to what led to such a wild and unstoppable spread of the coronavirus. Accusations of maladministration within the World Health Organization (WHO) and connivance with China emerged. Many countries battled to “flatten” the runaway COVID-19 and economic curves. Many countries and territories went on lockdown, with millions infected and hundreds of thousands dead by the time this book was going into production. Global economic stimulus packages were urgently instituted, and the tourism sector was among the top beneficiaries of such packages. The chapter also presents sections on the importance of the tourism sector to the global economy and how past pandemics affected the sector. It further highlights the overall methodological framework used for data generation and analysis.","Nhamo, Godwell; Dube, Kaitano; Chikodzi, David",Counting the Cost of COVID-19 on the Global Tourism Industry,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7980017/,344
49453,The Future of AI or AI for the Future,2020-12-06,"While the tourism industry was on a steady growth path up to 2019, it remains sensitive and vulnerable to natural and political shocks. Such shocks have been on the increase in the recent past. Of concern has been the increase in diseases and pandemics which have become more prevalent since 2000 to 2020. As a result of the interlinkages in the tourism industry, disease outbreaks are often disruptive to global tourism economies. This chapter assesses the impact of COVID-19 on the hotel industry and shared accommodation in the form of Airbnb. Using critical document analysis and tracking hotel bookings from machine learning data for five top global online travel agencies and the American Hotel and Lodging Association, among other authoritative sources, the study found that COVID-19 has had a devastating impact on the sector. COVID-19 has led to massive booking cancellations and record low bookings with adverse effects on annual accommodation bookings for 2020 globally. This has, in turn, resulted in hotel closures and empty rooms for Airbnb properties. The slump in business has further led to record high hotel employee layoffs and/or furloughs, while Airbnb property owners battle to pay fixed expenses and mortgages on their properties. In addition, most global hotel chains have cancelled dividend payments and postponed capital expenditure to avoid bankruptcy and industry collapse. There are real fears that the impact of the pandemic, far exceeding previous disasters such as SARS, will reverse the gains and the contribution made towards the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals. This study recommends the scaling up of several government and private sector relief funds and other measures aimed at assisting both the industry and its employees hardest hit by COVID-19. Particular attention should be given to small- to medium-size enterprises and establishments in developing countries.","Nhamo, Godwell; Dube, Kaitano; Chikodzi, David",Counting the Cost of COVID-19 on the Global Tourism Industry,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7980031/,344

49717,"Bioenergy and Bio-based Products from the Brazilian Amazon: Social, Economic, and Environmental Aspects",2021-01-05,"Resuscitation of the injured patient continues to be a highly debated and rapidly evolving topic. Multiple studies have struggled to determine the optimal strategy to combat, and ultimately prevent, trauma-induced coagulopathy. This chapter discusses the risks and benefits of resuscitation protocols utilizing plasma in its various forms. Plasma is the aqueous portion of blood that contains coagulation factors, fibrinolytic proteins, albumin, immunoglobulins, and numerous other proteins. Plasma can be obtained via whole blood from phlebotomy or by apheresis. Once collected, it can be frozen for storage. If frozen within 8 hours, the product is labeled as fresh frozen plasma. If frozen after this window but within 24 hours, it is labeled as plasma frozen within 24 hours, or FP24. When these frozen forms are mobilized from the blood bank, they are thawed in a water bath to create thawed plasma, which can be stored in liquid form for up to 5 days prior to transfusion. Liquid plasma is a distinct product derived from whole blood and never frozen. While most centers employ its use for 21–26 days, it can be stored for up to 30 days prior to transfusion. Dried plasma is produced from frozen plasma by lyophilization or spray-drying and then later reconstituted for transfusion. These forms vary in their activity of coagulation factors, but all may be useful in the resuscitation of the injured patient. Beyond the well-known coagulation factors, other proteins and microparticles abound in plasma, and these have profound protective effects. Studies looking at the endotheliopathy associated with hemorrhagic shock have shown a decrease in the inflammatory response, promotion of endothelial repair, and decreased edema with plasma transfusion. Plasma also remains one of the best volume expanders and acid-base buffers available. Protocols utilizing plasma early in resuscitation, at the time of patient presentation, have shown a decrease in the amount of blood products transfused, as well as an improvement in survival. Transfusion ratios of plasma-platelet-red blood cell units in a 1:1:1 ratio show significant improvement reduction in hemorrhage-related mortality compared to 1:1:2. Adverse events are more common with plasma transfusion than with other fractionated blood products, but the overall incidence remains extremely low. Major risks include transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI), transfusion-associated circulatory overload (TACO), infectious disease transmission, acute transfusion reactions, and leukocyte-associated reactions. Future possibilities for the development of plasma products have recently focused on dried plasma. French, German, and South African dried plasma products are currently used in their respective countries, but none is approved for use in the United States. With encouraging reports out of recent military and civilian prehospital use and numerous ongoing trials in the United States, dried plasma may be the solution to the many logistical problems inherent in frozen, thawed, and liquid plasma.","Brill, Jason B.; Cotton, Bryan A.; Lawless, Ryan A.",Trauma Induced Coagulopathy,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7981055/,344

The problem is that permanent emergencies challenge democratic principles, such as the separation of powers: under states of emergencies, power is often concentrated in the hands of the executive. A second issue with using an exceptional framework to address both terrorism and wars is that it might undermine the constitutional protection of fundamental rights.

The “risks” normatively associated with childbirth under that model are subsumed by the risks generated by disasters. The chapter is based on written accounts of what actually works for pregnant and birthing women and their babies, namely, skilled midwifery care with basic, low-tech equipment, collaboration with local midwives, and, in rare cases, the ability to transfer care to obstetricians. The authors of these accounts are midwife Vicki Penwell, founder of the NGO Mercy in Action, and midwife Robin Lim, founder of the Bumi Sehat maternity care clinics in Indonesia, the Philippines, Nepal, and Haiti. The outcome statistics they provide for their disaster zone care clearly demonstrate the effectiveness and sustainability of their flexible, portable models of care. We also draw on written accounts of the experiences of Japanese women who gave birth immediately after the 3/11/2011 Great Japanese Earthquake by Tsipy Ivry, Rika Takaki-Einy, and Jun Murotsuki. Davis-Floyd describes some of the rapid changes in global maternity care as a result of the coronavirus pandemic and their effects on both practitioners and childbearers. This balance between a focus on providers and a focus on women helps us to clearly see what works from both perspectives. The most essential lesson learned from these accounts of birth in disaster zones is that maternity care should be decentralized, everywhere, both for disaster and epidemic preparedness and under normal conditions. Women want, and need to receive, care in their communities.","Davis-Floyd, Robbie; Lim, Robin; Penwell, Vicki; Ivry, Tsipy",Sustainable Birth in Disruptive Times,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7982972/,344
50032,Guest Editor’s Note,2021-03-23,"This paper investigates mediated negotiations in ‘smart city’ experimentalism. As often claimed, data can open pathways for innovative planning processes. However, the idea of planning underpinned by the interplay between citizens and data too often remains unquestioned. How might we move the idea of planning from data to provide (technical solutions) to data to transform (urban societal realities)? How can data empower citizens as true drivers of a transformative urban change? This paper argues for a planning perspective to enhance a new sense of citizenship in a future technology-driven urban democracy. The framework combines planning theory with theories of societal change under a critical pragmatism. The empirical research derives from Mobility Urban Values (MUV2020), a Horizon 2020 innovation and research project (2017–2020), with the ambition to change mobility endeavors toward a more participatory and sustainable urban policy. The paper synthesizes analysis of the ‘practice stories’ of professionals dealing with and facilitating the interplay between data and citizens in six European cities. It then discusses MUV’s deliberative planning process in which citizens generate data (co-creation of values), interpret data (co-design of facts) and perform utterances to call for new urban policy (co-production of actions). The conclusions draw a possible pathway to enhance smart urban planning as a perspective to empower citizens with data for a progressive democracy in the era of digitalization. Change-oriented practitioners can potentially facilitate smart urban planning through: 1) technological devices that engage individual citizens (choices) with data practices in everyday life; 2) frames for the interpretation of data with citizens’ and communities (practice) and 3) public conversations between citizens with other publics (system) for new street-level practices of urban democracy.","Lissandrello, Enza",Smart and Sustainable Planning for Cities and Regions,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7983120/,344
50199,Conclusion,2020-12-05,"This article analyzes the evolution of discourses surrounding Brexit and interprets them in the context of broader shifts in the character of British liberal and conservative traditions since the 1990s. It argues that the evolution of debates about Britain’s place in Europe, the 2016 referendum, and its aftermath can be usefully understood using the analytical frames, derived from Tönnies and Weber, of Gemeinschaft, or “community,” and Gesellschaftt, or “society.” It suggests further that the discourses surrounding Brexit and prevailing interpretations of it have been shaped by exhumed and redeployed strands of British liberal and conservative thought and only partially successful attempts to fashion a new synthesis among them. It shows that supporters of Brexit have engaged in a strategy of “negative integration,” casting Britain as a territorially defensive nation defending itself against external “others” in ways that have been informed by these redeployed traditions. It concludes that these dynamics have resulted in and reflected a deeply fractured British society and have highlighted the prevalence of political amateurism in the British political class.","Vail, Mark I.",Br Polit,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7986641/,344

Firstly, an open and speculative university should cultivate forms of education where making mistakes is considered not only as routine to learning but as a necessary process for learning. Secondly, a university grounded in academic freedom is not only pertinent for free, critical engagement that is unafraid but can play a pivotal role in calling into question existing norms and hegemonies, policies as well as political structures and discourses. It also opens up the possibility of free and critical thought, including intellectual positions.

50417,The Long-Term View of the Greek Economy Under the Normal and the Optimal Pro-growth Scenario: 2020–2030,2020-08-19,"The most significant change in the world of space applications in the past decade is what might be called the small satellite revolution. This small satellite revolution is closely aligned with what is also now known as “Space 2.0” or “NewSpace.” Probing discussions of this small satellite revolution and efforts to identify the prime factors that gave rise to this profound change in the space industry produce a number of diverse but convincing answers to what has produced this small satellite revolution. The drivers of this change, largely within the past decade, include (i) new types of flat panel user antennas that can electronically track low Earth orbit satellites in mega-constellations; (ii) new more efficient ways to design and manufacture small satellites at much lower cost and sometimes with the use of off-the-shelf technology; (iii) new lower-cost launchers that can deploy small satellites at much lower cost; (iv) advances in microelectronics, smaller but higher performance sensors, improved component design and manufacture, etc.; (v) a rapid evolution of space services markets through the creation of new types of commercial satellite applications as well as expanded attempts to provide expanded space services to unserved markets in developing economies – especially in the case of broadband Internet streaming and remote sensing; (vi) entrepreneurial business innovation in the space field, often driven by out-of-the-box thinking from the world of computer services and social media; and (vii) new ways of financing small satellite startup ventures based on mechanism such as “Kickstarter,” crowdsourcing, rounds of venture capital funding, and crossover investment in satellite applications from new industries such as from the world of computer and information services, investment banking, and other revenue sources. This Handbook of Small Satellite has sought to examine in some depth all of the sources of change that has produced the small satellite revolution. It has examined the technical, operational, financial, business, economic, regulatory, launcher, and institutional aspects of this important new world of space applications. Innovation is everywhere. There are actually contributions not only on the technical and operational side but from every other side of the business as well. Thus change has come from the small satellite business (i.e., new entries and startups that operate on completely different business models and timetables). There are key changes, from the world of manufacturing and design (i.e., additive manufacturing and use of off-the-shelf components). The small satellite business models have helped reinvent the world of space business and finance that is quite different from the approach taken by giant aerospace companies born of the so-called world of the military-industrial complex. Thus new business practices from the world of small satellites reflect many new patterns of thinking (i.e., new sources of financing and “clean enough rooms”). This new type of entrepreneurial thinking has led to many new ideas such as about sparing philosophies and rapid prototyping and new generations of satellite design in months rather than years. Small satellites have, in short, shaken up thinking throughout the space industry, and change has percolated almost everywhere one might imagine – and then some. This final chapter seeks to sum up the many areas of change and innovation that have been born of the new world of small satellites. Thus this concluding chapter is divided into discussing important new aspects of the world of small satellites that have permeated the entire space industry. These various sections that are drawn from the component parts of the book include defining the various types of small satellites; satellite technology; design and manufacturing; launch and deployment; operations and sparing philosophy; ground systems technology; business, financing, risk-minimization, and insurance; and regulatory, safety, and institutional issues. This chapter concludes with some notes about the practical aspect that are available to readers of the handbook. This includes some guidance with regard to what detailed information is available concerning actual small satellite systems that have been deployed and projects to test new technology or to address space debris concerns. This includes some background with regard to information provided in Section 13 related to small satellite businesses, launch vehicle providers, small satellite networks deployed or planned to be deployed, registration processes related to small satellite systems, the UN sustainability guidelines, and how small satellite systems might relate to the meeting of these goals. Finally, this conclusion underscores how dynamic both the small satellite market and the launch vehicle systems newly designed to support the launch of small satellites is at this early stage of development. Bankruptcies, mergers, and other realignments are already happening. The COVID-19 will serve to accelerate downturns for small satellite ventures and new launch vehicle developments alike. OneWeb declared bankruptcy as of May2020, but bailout financing from the UK Government and financing from Indian mobile communications carrier Bharti Global has managed to rescue this system. ‘New Space’ ventures Speedcast Ltd. and Leosat plus launcher companies Vector and Firefly have all now gone bankrupt, and many other companies have indicated a pause or withdrawal from possible small satellite enterprises. And most of these negative impacts preceded the economic downturns that will be a consequence of the Covid-19 virus that most economists foresee as likely to generate a global economic recession. Some economists forecast that the downturn on space-related ventures might be as much as a 30% reduction in new investment. Not until 2022 will the impact be clearly quantifiable.","Pelton, Joseph N.",Handbook of Small Satellites,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7990670/,344

Its main premise was to decipher the manner in which healthy human relationships could be promoted through social work and social development interventions. In its concluding remarks, this chapter notes that since the dawn of democracy in 1994, South Africa has not only undergone fundamental changes, but it has in many respects been in a fluid state. Also, the country still has social and economic fissures it inherited from colonial and apartheid rule. The foregoing situation has continuously compounded many social problems which were nurtured by the unjust systems of colonialism and apartheid.

Furthermore, when the share of immigrants reaches a tipping point, estimated at 3–4% of the population within an area, the majority population begins to leave the area in what is commonly termed “white flight.” Segregation can have extensive social effects, giving rise to “parallel societies,” where religious extremism and gang crime can extend their influence.","Sanandaji, Tino",Mass Challenge,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7991331/,344
50607,Conclusions,2020-07-19,"Human serum albumin (HSA) is the predominant product of hepatic protein synthesis and one of the more abundant plasma proteins. HSA is a monomeric multidomain macromolecule, representing the main determinant of plasma oncotic pressure and the main modulator of fluid distribution between body compartments. HSA displays an essential role in maintaining the integrity of the vascular barrier. HSA is the most important antioxidant capacity of human plasma, in addition to its ability to protect the body from the harmful effects of heavy metals such as iron and copper and reduce their ability to produce reactive oxygen radicals. HSA is the main depot for nitric oxide (NO) transport in the blood. HSA represents the main carrier for fatty acids, affects pharmacokinetics of many drugs, and provides the metabolic modification of some drugs and displays pseudo-enzymatic properties. HSA has been widely used successfully for more than 50 years in many settings of perioperative medicine including hypovolemia, shock, burns, surgical blood loss, sepsis, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Recently, the use of HSA has shown a promising neuroprotective effect in patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage. The most recent evidence-based functions and uses of HSA in the perioperative period are reviewed in this chapter.","Farag, Ehab; Ebrahim, Zeyd Y.",Perioperative Fluid Management,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7991333/,344

However, magnetic nanoparticles used as thermal mediators play a very important role in the efficacy of the method in the irreversible destruction of tumors. The NPs must meet a number of physical and magnetic characteristics in order to obtain the maximum hyperthermal effect, but also a reduced or even lack of toxicity on healthy cells. This chapter presents just this aspect of biocompatibility/cytotoxicity and nanoformulations of magnetic nanoparticles for their use in superparamagnetic hyperthermia. We will consider the recent nanoformulations that could be used successfully in superparamagnetic hyperthermia, tested in vitro and in vivo, as well as current trends in dual therapy, thermochemotherapy, or thermo-radiotherapy.","Caizer, Costică; Dehelean, Cristina; Coricovac, Dorina Elena; Caizer, Isabela Simona; Şoica, Codruta",Nanoformulations in Human Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7991348/,344

We compare this chemical reaction in the active site of the New Delhi metallo-β-lactamase (NDM-1) with the hydrolysis of the antibacterial drug imipenem. The nucleophilic attack occurs with the energy barrier of 14 kcal/mol for imipenem and simultaneously upon binding a boronic acid inhibitor. A boron atom of an inhibitor exhibits stronger electrophilic properties than the carbonyl carbon atom of imipenem in a solution that is quantified by atomic Fukui indices. Upon forming the prereaction complex between NDM-1 and inhibitor, the lone electron pair of the nucleophile interacts with the vacant p-orbital of boron that facilitates the chemical reaction. We analyze a set of boronic acid compounds with the benzo[b]thiophene core complexed with the NDM-1 and propose quantitative structure-sroperty relationship (QSPR) equations that can predict IC50 values from the calculated descriptors of electron density. These relations are applied to classify other boronic acids with the same core found in the database of chemical compounds, PubChem, and proposed ourselves.

OBJECTIVES: We aim to identify the causes of occupational stress and burnout in women in medicine, nursing and other health professions during the COVID-19 pandemic and interventions that can support female health professionals deal with this crisis through a rapid review. METHODS: We searched MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, PsycINFO and ERIC from December 2019 to 30 September 2020. The review protocol was registered in PROSPERO and is available online. We selected all empirical studies that discussed stress and burnout in women healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS: The literature search identified 6148 citations. A review of abstracts led to the retrieval of 721 full-text articles for assessment, of which 47 articles were included for review. Our findings show that concerns of safety (65%), staff and resource adequacy (43%), workload and compensation (37%) and job roles and security (41%) appeared as common triggers of stress in the literature.

51663,"Resilience of a Territory: Concept, Measurement, Governance",2021-04-17,"The balance between proteases and protease inhibitors plays a critical role in tissue remodeling during cardiovascular diseases. Different serine protease inhibitors termed serpins, which are expressed in the cardiovascular system, can exert a fine-tuned regulation of protease activities. Among them, protease nexin-1 (PN-1, encoded by SERPINE2) is a very powerful thrombin inhibitor and can also inactivate plasminogen activators and plasmin. Studies have shown that this serpin is expressed by all cell subpopulations in the vascular wall and by circulating cells but is barely detectable in plasma in the free form. PN-1 present in platelet granules and released upon activation has been shown to present strong antithrombotic and antifibrinolytic properties. PN-1 has a broad spectrum of action related to both hemostatic and blood vessel wall protease activities. Different studies showed that PN-1 is not only an important protector of vascular cells against protease activities but also a significant actor in the clearance of the complexes it forms with its targets. In this context, PN-1 overexpression has been observed in the pathophysiology of thoracic aortic aneurysms (TAA) and during the development of atherosclerosis in humans. Similarly, in the heart, PN-1 has been shown to be overexpressed in a mouse model of heart failure and to be involved in cardiac fibrosis. Overall, PN-1 appears to serve as a “hand brake” for protease activities during cardiovascular remodeling. This review will thus highlight the role of PN-1 in the cardiovascular system and deliver a comprehensive assessment of its position among serpins.","Madjene, Celina; Boutigny, Alexandre; Bouton, Marie-Christine; Arocas, Veronique; Richard, Benjamin",Front Cardiovasc Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8044347/,344

51803,2021: the beginning of a new era of immunisations?,2021-04-22,"In this paper, it is proposed to understand the opinion of the public regarding the policy of demonetization that is implemented recently in India through Aspect-based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA) that predicts the sentiment of specific aspects present in the text. The major aim is to identify the relevant contexts for various aspects. Most of the conventional techniques have adopted attention mechanisms and deep learning concepts that decrease the prediction accuracy and generate huge noise. Another major disadvantage with the attention mechanisms is that the sentiment related to few context words alters with various aspects, and hence it cannot be concluded from itself alone. This paper adopts the optimized deep learning concept for performing the ABSA for demonetization tweets. The proposed model involves various phases such as pre-processing, aspect extraction, polarity feature extraction, and sentiment classification. Initially, the different demonetization tweets collected from the Kaggle dataset are taken. Pre-processing is done with the help of four phases like stop words removal, punctuation removal, lower case conversion, and stemming from minimizing the data to its reduced format. This pre-processed data is further performed with aspect extraction to extract the opinion words. These extracted aspect words are converted to the features with the help of polarity score computation and Word2vec. The weight of the polarity scores is optimized using hybridization of two meta-heuristic algorithms like FireFly Algorithm (FF), and Multi-Verse Optimization (MVO), and the new algorithm is termed as Fire Fly-oriented Multi-Verse Optimizer (FF-MVO). Further, combined features are subjected to a deep learning algorithm called Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). As a modification to the existing RNN, the hidden neurons are optimized by the hybrid FF-MVO, FF-MVO-RNN classifies the positive and negative sentiments. Finally, the comparative analysis of different machine learning algorithms proves the competent performance of the proposed model.","Datta, Samik; Chakrabarti, Satyajit",S&#x00101;dhan&#x00101;,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8051288/,344

This reality is especially accentuated in Ecuador where, the shortage of healthcare workers combined with cultural and macroeconomic factors have led it to face the most aggressive outbreak in Latin America. In this context, the participation of medical students on the front line is indispensable. Appropriate training on COVID-19 is an urgent need that universities and health systems must guarantee. We aimed to describe the knowledge, attitudes and practices in Ecuadorian final year medical students in order to identify the knowledge gaps, perceptions and behavior patterns which could guide the desig3n of better medical education curricula regarding COVID-19. METHODS: This descriptive 33-item online survey conducted between April 6 to April 20 sent by email and by Facebook and WhatsApp. RESULTS: 309 students responded to the survey. 88% scored high (≥ 70% correct) for knowledge of the disease. The majority of students were pessimistic about possible government actions, which is reflected in the negative attitude towards the control of COVID19 in Ecuador and volunteering during the outbreak (77%, and 58% of the students, respectively). Moreover, 91% of students said they did not have adequate protective equipment or training in their health facilities. CONCLUSIONS: Ecuador has a capable upcoming workforce that could benefit from an opportunity to strengthen, improve and advance their training in preparation for COVID-19. Creating a national curriculum may be one of the most effective ways for all students to be trained, while simultaneously focusing on the students’ most pressing concerns.","Lincango-Naranjo, Eddy; Solis-Pazmino, Paola; Lincango-Naranjo, Eddy",BJS Open,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8030243/,344

The clinical forms of leishmaniasis differ from cutaneous leishmaniasis, mucocutaneous leishmaniasis and visceral leishmaniasis (VL) which depend on the parasite species and the host’s immune responses. There are significant challenges to the available anti-leishmanial drug therapy, particularly in severe forms of disease, and the rise of drug resistance has made it more difficult. Currently, no licensed vaccines have been introduced to the market for the control and elimination of VL. A potential target for use in candidate vaccines against leishmaniasis has been shown to be leishmania Kinetoplastid membrane protein-11 (KMP-11) antigen. In this study, we chose KMP-11 antigen as target antigen in our vaccine construct. In addition, B-type flagellin (fliC) was used as an adjuvant for enhancing vaccine immunogenicity. The GSGSGSGSGSG linker was applied to link the KMP-11 antigen and fliC (KMP-11-fliC) to construct our fusion protein. Bioinformatics approaches such as; 3D homology modeling, CTL, B-cell, MHC class I and II epitopes prediction, allergenicity, antigenicity evaluations, molecular docking, fast simulations of flexibility of docked complex and in silico cloning were employed to analysis and evaluation of various properties of the designed fusion construct. Computational results showed that our engineered structure has the potential for proper stimulation of cellular and humoral immune responses against VL. Consequently, it could be proposed as a candidate vaccine against VL according to these data and after verifying the efficacy of the candidate vaccine through in vivo and in vitro immunological tests.","Atapour, Amir; Ghalamfarsa, Farideh; Naderi, Samaneh; Hatam, Gholamreza",Int J Pept Res Ther,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8067785/,344

It has further stimulated the paradoxical debate of development and desolation in the contemporary scenario. Since the coal resources are profusely available in India and it is comparatively less expensive, the country has been largely relying on it for its essential and non-essential consumption needs. Coal resources indirectly fulfil many of the modern requirements and comforts. Consequently, mining of minerals in general and coal in particular has become the prime focus. It helps to generate revenue, augment industrialisation and promote employment opportunities in India. Despite these progressive features, the opencast coal mining activities impose serious threats to the livelihood of the local communities. Based on critical review of the relevant literature, the article seeks to exhibit the mineral reserves and coal mining activities at global, national and regional context. The paper has incorporated a special focus on Odisha—a resource-rich state located in eastern part of India. Particularly, the two existing major coalfields—Talcher and Ib valley, situated in western part of the state—have been emphasised. The manifold adverse externalities of the coal mining practices on the livelihood pattern among the affected people have been assessed.

Our bipartite weighted network considers two different types of nodes: one represents the ports, while the other represents the countries where there are major import/export activity from each port. The freight traffic among both types of nodes is modeled by weighting the volume of product transported. To illustrate the model, the Spanish case is considered, with the data segmented by each type of traffic for a fine tuning. A sort of link prediction is possible, finding for those communities with two or more ports, countries that are part of the same community but with which some ports do not have yet significant traffic. The evolution of the traffics is analyzed by comparing the communities in 2009 and 2019. The set of communities formed by the ports of the Spanish port system can be used to identify global similarities between them, comparing the membership of the different ports in communities for both periods and each type of traffic in particular.","García, Nicanor; Adenso-Díaz, Belarmino; Calzada-Infante, Laura",Eur,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8217790/,344

PSE occurred in 10 out of 87 patients (11.5%) and 13 out of 198 sessions (6.6%). The types of PSE that occurred were hypotension (8, 62%), heart rate instability (3, 23%), and desaturation (2, 15%). Circulation-related events occurred in 85% of overall cases. No accidents, such as line/tube removal or falls, were observed. The highest incidence of PSE was observed during the mobilization level of standing (8 out of 39 sessions, 20.5%). The occurrence of PSE correlated with the highest activity level under logistic regression analysis. Close vigilance is required for intubated patients during active mobilization in the standing position with regard to circulatory dynamics.","Katsukawa, Hajime; Ota, Kohei; Liu, Keibun; Morita, Yasunari; Watanabe, Shinichi; Sato, Kazuhiro; Ishii, Kenzo; Yasumura, Daisetsu; Takahashi, Yo; Tani, Takafumi; Oosaki, Hitoshi; Nanba, Tomoya; Kozu, Ryo; Kotani, Toru",J Clin Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8231849/,344

Our work has resulted in the generation of a versatile imaging probe using recombinant Spike receptor binding domain conjugated to fluorescent quantum dots (QDs). This probe is capable of engaging in energy transfer quenching with ACE2‐conjugated gold nanoparticles enabling biochemical monitoring of binding. Neutralizing antibodies and recombinant human ACE2 blocked quenching, demonstrating a specific binding interaction. In cell‐based assays, we observed immediate binding of the probe on the cell surface of ACE2‐expressing cells followed by endocytosis. Neutralizing antibodies and ACE2‐Fc fully prevented binding and endocytosis with low nanomolar potency. Importantly, we can use this QD nanoparticle probe to identify and validate inhibitors of the SARS‐CoV‐2 Spike and ACE2 receptor binding in human cells. This work enables facile, rapid, and high‐throughput biochemical‐ and cell‐based screening of inhibitors for coronavirus Spike‐mediated cell recognition and entry.","Gorshkov, Kirill; Susumu, Kimihiro; Chen, Jiji; Xu, Miao; Pradhan, Manisha; Zhu, Wei; Hu, Xin; Breger, Joyce; Wolak, Mason; Oh, Eunkeu",FASEB J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8239633/,344
55282,Metalcasting Industry Research,2021-07-01,"COVID‐19 was a major catalyst for a sea change in medical education. The pandemic pushed the teaching of anatomy, histology and embryology out of the classroom and labs, across states, countries, and continents. It demanded an immense effort and adaptability, especially from faculty. Teaching through the thick of the pandemic has been the challenge of a lifetime to instructors, doctors, educators. We are living through what may be the most difficult time in the history of global healthcare. The pandemic threw us off our paths and demanded more than training, more than skills. It demanded our passion and our courage. Our willingness to lean into our values and embrace our purpose: the success of our students. All the rules were changed as we navigated uncharted territories together. It was a call to courage and the Team of World Changers at Mount Sinai showed up, bravely, with all their passion, their curiosity to ask questions, try new modalities, and look for solutions out of their comfort zones. Mentors and experienced professors supported the system with humbleness and unparalleled openness, leaning into the vulnerable place of learning an entirely new set of skills in record time. The pandemic demanded resilience: that willingness to try again and again, with patience, flexibility and persistence. Structures is the first course of our medical school, encompassing Anatomy, Histology, and Embryology. It is traditionally a hands‐on course which was moved to a 100% remote system in a matter of 3 months. We stripped ourselves from our identities and our voices, and went searching for something entirely new, yet authentic, still ours. Our bodies ached and our minds were drained at the end of working days of 12, 14, sometimes 24 hours, weekdays and weekends, as we strived to be the air under our student's wings. Zoom became our classroom, our lab, our meeting room, our offices, our everywhere; we acquired and repurposed resources, created new visualizations, developed new materials, expanded the team, reinvented ourselves, defied our boundaries as educators, and reached out farther than ever before. We accelerated the technological fluency of our teaching force and we dealt with questions of equality of learning, e.g. students in different time zones, disparity of internet speed, quality of hardware, not to mention the inherent isolation of the distance learning modality. And we succeeded. We got to teach and inspire our students. We got to learn and be inspired by them. We got to see them being curious and daring, discovering new ways to learn, and finding their own paths as they progressed in Structures, and in their career. We were rewarded with priceless joy and fulfillment. As we peak into the future, we see a world of possibilities and potential, coupling hands‐on work and remote technology in the world of Anatomical Sciences and Medical Education. We know we can reach out our arms farther than ever before and spread knowledge at an even larger scale, prioritizing the quality of learning, and embracing our community anywhere in the world. At the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, we believe that “impossible” is a temporary concept, and we pride ourselves of having the most passionate and compassionate thinkers and doers in our teams. This was a turbulent year, but it made us stronger and today we hope and work for a 2021 of healing and progress.","Curcio, Daniella",FASEB J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8239848/,344

In this paper, a REIT’s prime operating revenue ratio (POR) is measured as the ratio of rental revenue to total revenue. The empirical results show that REITs that earn more revenue from their prime business—property rentals—are less apt to take on risk but also achieve higher operational performance in the cross-section and over the medium term. The magnitudes of these results in a market crisis period are even stronger than in normal times. We also find evidence that REITs with higher POR are associated with less information asymmetry, higher operational efficiency, and higher market value. We also use three alternative REIT business focus measures based on their assets, expenses, and income. The results are qualitatively and quantitatively similar. To investigate why some REITs focus to a greater extent on non-prime businesses, the paper provides evidence that REIT executives receive, on average, higher pay when their firms engage more extensively in other businesses, and larger REITs are more likely to explore non-rental-revenue businesses. Lastly, we use the coronavirus pandemic as a quasi-experimental setting and provide evidence that REITs that have earned higher POR in recent years generally achieve better operational performance and reduce risk during the first three quarters of 2020. In sum, the results suggest that a REIT’s focus on its prime business generally leads to greater profitability and lower risk.","Feng, Zifeng; Liu, Peng",J Real Estate Finan Econ,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8264170/,344

DESIGN: Predictive modeling used cohorts from the Health Facts database (Cerner Corporation, Kansas City, MO). SETTING: Children hospitalized in ICUs. PATIENTS: Children with greater than or equal to one ICU admission (n = 20,014) and randomly selected routine care children without ICU admission (n = 20,130) from 2009 to 2016 were used for model development and validation. An independent 2017–2018 cohort consisted of 80,089 children. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENT AND MAIN RESULTS: Initially, we undersampled non-ICU patients for development and comparison of the models. We randomly assigned 64% of patients for training, 8% for validation, and 28% for testing in both clinical groups. Two additional validation cohorts were tested: a simulated children’s hospitals and the 2017–2018 cohort. The main outcome was ICU care or non-ICU care in four future time periods based on physiology, therapy, and care intensity. Four independent, sequential, and fully connected neural networks were calibrated to risk of ICU care at each time period. Performance for all models in the test sample were comparable including sensitivity greater than or equal to 0.727, specificity greater than or equal to 0.885, accuracy greater than 0.850, area under the receiver operating characteristic curves greater than or equal to 0.917, and all had excellent calibration (all R(2)s > 0.98). Model performance in the 2017–2018 cohort was sensitivity greater than or equal to 0.545, specificity greater than or equal to 0.972, accuracy greater than or equal to 0.921, area under the receiver operating characteristic curves greater than or equal to 0.946, and R(2)s greater than or equal to 0.979. Performance metrics were comparable for the simulated children’s hospital and for hospitals stratified by teaching status, bed numbers, and geographic location. CONCLUSIONS: Machine learning models using physiology, therapy, and care intensity predicting future care needs had promising performance metrics. Notably, performance metrics were similar as the prediction time periods increased from 6–12 hours to 24–30 hours.","Trujillo Rivera, Eduardo A.; Chamberlain, James M.; Patel, Anita K.; Zeng-Treitler, Qing; Bost, James E.; Heneghan, Julia A.; Morizono, Hiroki; Pollack, Murray M.",Crit Care Explor,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8357255/,344

Air taxi services could be a solution to this growing problem by bringing the existing transportation system to the three dimensional space. This paper analyzes the challenges and requirements of developing a vertiport intended for the use of air taxis at Cologne Bonn Airport. This research was conducted with the information available at the time of writing, for which a basis scenario is defined for the Cologne Bonn Airport where important aspects of an air taxi service are determined such as passenger demand and possible vehicles. The main aspects analysed were the requirements on the vertiport infrastructure and its location, as well as the requirements on passenger processing. For the defined basis scenario, results show that the preferential locations to develop a vertiport at Cologne Bonn Airport are the roof top levels of parking garages P2 and P3. Furthermore, it is shown that given the estimated passenger demand, a very high utilization factor of the defined infrastructure is to be expected. This paper provides a starting point for the development of an air taxi service at Cologne Bonn Airport. Further research is needed in key issues such as the financial aspects of an air taxi service, its integration into the current operating scenario of the Cologne Bonn Airport and the approval process for an air taxi service and the vertiport itself.","Feldhoff, Eva; Soares Roque, Gonçalo",CEAS Aeronaut J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8395386/,344

This study aims to identify potential natural inhibitors of the Human Telomerase from compounds derived from edible African plants. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A library of 1,126 natural compounds was molecularly docked against the Telomerase Reverse Transcriptase (PDB ID: 5ugw), the catalytic subunit of the target protein. Curcumin, a known Telomerase inhibitor was used as the standard. The front-runner compounds were screened for bioavailability, pharmacokinetic properties, and bioactivity using the SWISSADME, PKCSM, and Molinspiration webservers respectively. The molecular dynamic simulation and analyses of the apo and holo proteins were performed by the Galaxy supercomputing webserver. RESULTS: The results of the molecular docking and virtual screening reveal Augustamine and Camptothecin as lead compounds. Augustamine has better drug-likeness and pharmacokinetic properties while Camptothecin showed better bioactivity and stronger binding affinity (-8.2 kcal/mol) with the target. The holo structure formed by Camptothecin showed greater inhibitory activity against the target with a total RMSF of 169.853, B-Factor of 20.164, and 108 anti-correlating residues. CONCLUSION: Though they both act at the same binding site, Camptothecin induces greater Telomerase inhibition and better molecular stability than the standard, Curcumin. Further tests are required to investigate the inhibitory activities of the lead compounds.","Rowaiye, Adekunle Babajide; Mendes, Yoroshi Joana Teca; Olofinsae, Samson Ayodeji; Oche, John Breakthrough; Oladipo, Oluwakemi Hannah; Okpalefe, Okiemute Ajiroghene; Ogidigo, Joyce Oloaigbe",Heliyon,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8405929/,344

The established method for refraction comparison using spherical equivalent (M) and J0, J45 vector transformations by Bland–Altman analysis is too complex for non-eye doctors involved with vision screening and remote vision clinics. Therefore, a simpler comparison technique was developed. METHODS: Based on the spectacle limit to resolve grade A 1 logMAR, B 3 logMAR and C 6 logMAR blur, J0, J45, and M are combined into the Alaska Blind Child Discovery (ABCD) composite ellipsoid GRADE system. Pediatric eye patients had confirmatory examination after dry refraction with three portable autorefractors: Plusoptix, 2WIN and Retinomax. The refractions were then compared using both Bland–Altman and ABCD composite. Performance to detect AAPOS amblyopia risk factors was also assessed. RESULTS: A total of 202 children, mean age seven years, 28% high spectacle need and 43% AAPOS 2013 amblyopia risk factors showed high correlation with cycloplegic refraction (intraclass correlation 0.49 to 0.90) for sphere, J0 and J45 spectacle components. Plusoptix had more (10%) inconclusives due to patients out-of-range. The Retinomax was unable to screen some younger children and was less reliable for sphere but gave more precise astigmatism estimates. The proportion of autorefractions expected to give GRADE A/B high-need patients acuity improvement to 20/40 would be 41% for Plusoptix, 39% for 2WIN and 65% for Retinomax. Sensitivity/specificity for amblyopia risk factor detection was 80%/83% for Plusoptix, 72%/88% for 2WIN and 84%/73% for Retinomax. CONCLUSION: The simplified spectacle comparison resembled Bland–Altman and could assist lay vision screeners and non-eye doctors attempting remote spectacle donation worldwide.","Arnold, Robert W; Martin, Samuel J; Beveridge, Joshua R; Arnold, Andrew W; Arnold, Stephanie L; Beveridge, Nathanael R; Smith, Kyle A",Clin Ophthalmol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8415895/,344

In this study, we intend to detect the effect of temperature, precipitation, and wind speed on the Coronavirus infected cases throughout climate seasons for the whole year of epidemic starting from February 20, 2020 to February 19, 2021 with considering data patterns of each season separately; winter, spring, summer, autumn, in Mediterranean European regions, whereas those are located at the similar temperature zone in southern Europe. We apply the panel data approach by considering the developed robust estimation of clustered standard error which leads to achieving high forecasting accuracy. The main finding supports that temperature and wind speed have significant influence in reducing the Coronavirus cases at the beginning of this epidemic particularly in the first-winter, spring, and early summer, but they have very weak effects in the autumn and second-winter. Therefore, it is important to take into account the changes throughout seasons, and to consider other indirect factors which influence the virus transmission. This finding could lead to significant contributions to policymakers in European Union and European Commission Environment to limit the Coronavirus transmissions.

As a series of important ON, nitrated phenolic compounds (NPs) are of high concentration in the atmosphere, although their formation mechanism and role in particulate nucleation and growth are not fully understood. Herein, using a high level of quantum mechanical calculations, we explore the formation paths of NPs initiated by NO3· radicals, where some common atmospheric species, such as H2O, (H2O)2, NH3, and dimethylamine (DMA), can act as molecular catalysts. The kinetic study predicts that the formation rate of methyl nitrophenols with the assistance of DMA and (H2O)2 can reach ∼103 molecules·cm-3·s-1 in a polluted and humid atmosphere. The volatilities obtained from the empirical model show the formed NPs mainly belong to the intermediate and semivolatile organic compounds, which can participate in the growth process of aerosols rather than the early stage of cluster nucleation.

PATIENTS AND METHODS Between March and September 2009 we operated on five patients with early-stage prostate cancer (T1c) and a normal body mass index (<25). The procedure was carried out with a specially-designed multichannel trocar which contains two 5 mm and one 10 mm ports plus a 5 mm port placed in the left iliac fossa in order to have an adequate working angle. The first two patients received a nerve sparing radical prostatectomy. RESULTS All cases were completed successfully in a mean operative time of 225 minutes (range 210-250) with blood losses of less than 100 ml. All patients were discharged from the hospital in 3rd postoperative day and the catheter was always removed seven days from surgery. No intraoperative complications occurred. The pathological tumour stage revealed pT2bNo prostate cancer in all five cases without positive surgical margins. After a mean follow-up of 4 months (range 1-7) all patients have an undetectable prostate-specific antigen level and no postoperative early major complications. The first two patients were fully continent respectively after 3 and 8 weeks after surgery, the third patient uses one safety pad after three month from surgery. The last two patients have a moderate incontinence and are currently under rehabilitation. Regarding potency the first patient had intercourses without any therapies after two months from surgery while the second one (6 months follow up) has partial penile tumescence using oral vardenafil. CONCLUSION Two ports laparoscopic radical prostatectomy is feasible in very selected cases.

METHOD From a larger study about the experiences during the pandemic of 2028 individuals with and without disabilities, 181 adults with intellectual or developmental disabilities (or proxy) responded. RESULTS Most respondents with intellectual or developmental disabilities (92.8%) reported negative impacts from the pandemic, with 55.2% of the 96 employed pre-pandemic reporting impacted employment, including job loss. The negative impact of the pandemic was a significant predictor of stress level; social support was related to reduced stress. Stress level and the negative impact of the pandemic were inversely related to life satisfaction; social support was positively related to life satisfaction. Social support partially mediated the association between stress level and life satisfaction.

In this comprehensive review, we sought to describe how the sEMG properties are changed after SCI. We conducted a systematic literature search followed by a narrative review focusing on sEMG analysis techniques and signal properties post-SCI. We found that early reports were mostly focused on the qualitative analysis of sEMG patterns and evolved to semi-quantitative scores and a more detailed amplitude-based quantification. Nonetheless, recent studies are still constrained to an amplitude-based analysis of the sEMG, and there are opportunities to more broadly characterize the time- and frequency-domain properties of the signal as well as to take fuller advantage of high-density EMG techniques. We recommend the incorporation of a broader range of signal properties into the neurophysiological assessment post-SCI and the development of a greater understanding of the relation between these sEMG properties and underlying physiology. Enhanced sEMG analysis could contribute to a more complete description of the effects of SCI on upper and lower motor neuron function and their interactions, and also assist in understanding the mechanisms of change following neuromodulation or exercise therapy.","Balbinot, Gustavo; Li, Guijin; Wiest, Matheus Joner; Pakosh, Maureen; Furlan, Julio Cesar; Kalsi-Ryan, Sukhvinder; Zariffa, Jose",Journal of neuroengineering and rehabilitation,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12984-021-00888-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34187509/,344

62307,Is sugar extracted from plants less healthy than sugar consumed within plant tissues? The sugar anomaly.,2020-11-02,"Hematogenous and lymphogenous cancer metastases are significantly impacted by tumor neovascularization, which predominantly consists of blood vessel-relevant angiogenesis, vasculogenesis, vasculogenic mimicry, and lymphatic vessel-related lymphangiogenesis. Among the endothelial cells that make up the lining of tumor vasculature, a majority of them are tumor-derived endothelial cells (TECs), exhibiting cytogenetic abnormalities of aneuploid chromosomes. Aneuploid TECs are generated from ""cancerization of stromal endothelial cells"" and ""endothelialization of carcinoma cells"" in the hypoxic tumor microenvironment. Both processes crucially engage the hypoxia-triggered epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EndoMT). Compared to the cancerization process, endothelialization of cancer cells, which comprises the fusion of tumor cells with endothelial cells and transdifferentiation of cancer cells into TECs, is the dominant pathway. Tumor-derived endothelial cells, possessing the dual properties of cancerous malignancy and endothelial vascularization ability, are thus the endothelialized cancer cells. Circulating tumor-derived endothelial cells (CTECs) are TECs shed into the peripheral circulation. Aneuploid CD31+ CTECs, together with their counterpart CD31- circulating tumor cells (CTCs), constitute a unique pair of cellular circulating tumor biomarkers. This review discusses a proposed cascaded framework that focuses on the origins of TECs and CTECs in the hypoxic tumor microenvironment and their clinical implications for tumorigenesis, neovascularization, disease progression, and cancer metastasis. Aneuploid CTECs, harboring hybridized properties of malignancy, vascularization and motility, may serve as a unique target for developing a novel metastasis blockade cancer therapy.","Lin, Peter Ping",Cells,https://doi.org/10.3390/cells9061539; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32599893/,344
62331,Making the grade: Physiological adaptations to terrestrial environments in decapod crabs.,2021-08-13,"INTRODUCTION Video-assisted thoracic surgery (VATS) lung resections are complex procedures with a critical role played by endoscopic staplers in the transection of vessels, bronchi, and lung tissue. This retrospective, observational study compared hospital resource use, costs, and complications of VATS lobectomy procedures for whom powered versus manual endoscopic surgical staplers were used. METHODS Patients ≥ 18 years of age undergoing elective VATS lobectomy during an inpatient admission from January 1, 2012 to September 30, 2016 were identified from the Premier Healthcare Database (first admission = index admission). Use of either powered or manual endoscopic staplers during the index admission was identified from hospital administrative records. Multivariable regression analyses adjusting for patient, hospital, and provider characteristics and hospital-level clustering were carried out to compare the following outcomes between the powered and manual stapler groups: hospital length of stay (LOS), operating room time (ORT), hospital costs, complications (bleeding and/or transfusions, air leak complications, pneumonia, and infection), discharge status, and 30-, 60-, and 90-day all-cause readmissions. RESULTS The powered and manual stapler groups comprised 659 patients (mean age 66.1 years; 53.6% female) and 3100 patients (mean age 66.7 years; 54.8% female), respectively. In the multivariable analyses, the powered stapler group had shorter LOS (4.9 vs. 5.9 days, P < 0.001), lower total hospital costs ($23,841 vs. $26,052, P = 0.009), and lower rates of combined hemostasis complications (bleeding and/or transfusions; 8.5% vs. 16.0%, P < 0.001) and transfusions (5.4% vs. 10.9%, P = 0.002), compared with the manual stapler group. Other outcomes did not differ significantly between the study groups. Similar trends were observed in subanalyses comparing devices across predominant manufacturers in each group, and in subanalyses of patients with comorbid chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. CONCLUSION In this analysis of VATS lobectomy procedures, powered staplers were associated with significant benefits with respect to selected types of hospital resource use, costs, and clinical outcomes when compared with manual staplers.

METHODS The clinical data of 53 COVID-19 patients were collected from a single center in Wuhan from February 8, 2020 to March 25, 2020. The patients were divided into severe type group (38 patients) and critical type group (15 patients). The clinical characteristics, indexes of liver function, coagulation function and inflammatory markers were analyzed retrospectively. According to the degree of abnormal liver function in the process of diagnosis and treatment, the patients were divided into three groups: combined liver injury, mild abnormal liver function and normal liver function group. Statistical analysis was performed by using Student t test, Mann-Whitney U test, Kruskal-Wallis test and Chi-square test. RESULTS Among the 53 patients, 29 were male (54.7%) and 24 were female (45.3%), the median age was 57(27－80) years old. The time from onset to admission was (11.5±7.7) days. The levels of AST, TBIL, DBIL, ALP, GGT, LDH, D-dimer, PCT and hsCRP in critical patients were higher than those in severe patients (P<0.05). The levels of Alb in critical patients was lower than those in severe patients (P<0.05). Among the 53 patients, 34 (64%) patients showed abnormal elevation of ALT, AST or TBIL, while 4 (7.5%) patients showed the criteria of COVID-19 with liver injury. After the patients were grouping according to the degree of liver dysfunction, the levels of ALP, GGT and D-dimer of the patients in the liver injury group were significantly higher than those in the normal liver function group, D-dimer levels of the patients in the liver injury group was significantly higher than those in the mild abnormal liver function group, while the levels of ALP and GGT in the mild abnormal liver function group were significantly higher than those in the normal liver function group, and the differences were statistically significant(P<0.05). CONCLUSION In this group, the patients with COVID-19 severe/critical type have a certain proportion of liver injury accompanied by significantly increased D-dimer levels, critical type patients have more severe liver function and coagulation dysfunction, which may promote the progression of COVID-19.","Zhang, Jie; Gao, Xiao-Ling; Liu, Yan; Jiang, Yi; Jia, Zhi-Mei; Zhao, Fang-Fang; Xu, Dong; Huo, Li-Juan; Yang, Lin-Hua",Zhongguo shi yan xue ye xue za zhi,https://doi.org/10.19746/j.cnki.issn.1009-2137.2021.05.033; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34627444/,344

The novel ANKOR DLT is a DLT developed with three cuffs with a newly added carinal cuff designed to prevent further advancement by being blocked by the carina when the cuff is inflated. In this prospective study, the direction and depth of initial placement of ANKOR DLT were compared with those of conventional DLT. Patients undergoing thoracic surgery (n = 190) with one-lung ventilation (OLV) were randomly allocated into either left-sided conventional DLT group (n = 95) or left-sided ANKOR DLT group (n = 95). The direction and depth of DLT position were compared via fiberoptic bronchoscopy (FOB) after endobronchial intubation between the groups. There was no significant difference in the number of right mainstem endobronchial intubations between the two groups (p = 0.468). The difference between the initial depth of DLT placement and the target depth confirmed by FOB was significantly lower in the ANKOR DLT group than in the conventional DLT group (1.8 ± 1.8 vs. 12.9 ± 9.7 mm; p < 0.001). In conclusion, the ANKOR DLT facilitated its initial positioning at the optimal depth compared to the conventional DLT.","Kim, Namo; Byon, Hyo-Jin; Kim, Go Eun; Park, Chungon; Joe, Young Eun; Suh, Sung Min; Oh, Young Jun",Journal of clinical medicine,https://doi.org/10.3390/jcm9040977; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32244659/,344

65127,Acknowledgment of Reviewers 2020.,2021-01-18,"OBJECTIVE To estimate the global prevalence of handwashing with soap and derive a pooled estimate of the effect of hygiene on diarrhoeal diseases, based on a systematic search of the literature. METHODS Studies with data on observed rates of handwashing with soap published between 1990 and August 2013 were identified from a systematic search of PubMed, Embase and ISI Web of Knowledge. A separate search was conducted for studies on the effect of hygiene on diarrhoeal disease that included randomised controlled trials, quasi-randomised trials with control group, observational studies using matching techniques and observational studies with a control group where the intervention was well defined. The search used Cochrane Library, Global Health, BIOSIS, PubMed, and Embase databases supplemented with reference lists from previously published systematic reviews to identify studies published between 1970 and August 2013. Results were combined using multilevel modelling for handwashing prevalence and meta-regression for risk estimates. RESULTS From the 42 studies reporting handwashing prevalence we estimate that approximately 19% of the world population washes hands with soap after contact with excreta (i.e. use of a sanitation facility or contact with children's excreta). Meta-regression of risk estimates suggests that handwashing reduces the risk of diarrhoeal disease by 40% (risk ratio 0.60, 95% CI 0.53-0.68); however, when we included an adjustment for unblinded studies, the effect estimate was reduced to 23% (risk ratio 0.77, 95% CI 0.32-1.86). CONCLUSIONS Our results show that handwashing after contact with excreta is poorly practiced globally, despite the likely positive health benefits.","Freeman, Matthew C; Stocks, Meredith E; Cumming, Oliver; Jeandron, Aurelie; Higgins, Julian P T; Wolf, Jennyfer; Prüss-Ustün, Annette; Bonjour, Sophie; Hunter, Paul R; Fewtrell, Lorna; Curtis, Valerie",Tropical medicine & international health : TM & IH,https://doi.org/10.1111/tmi.12339; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24889816/,344

66649,Editor's Introduction: The Postpandemic World.,2020-06-01,"To date, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has infected millions of individuals around the world. This virus causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and has led to numerous deaths worldwide. A large percentage of infected patients present asymptomatically, augmenting the spread of the virus. Symptomatic COVID19 commonly causes mild to severe respiratory disease and fever, but some individuals experience serious complications that can result in death. Immune compromised, high risk, and elderly individuals are at an increased risk of more severe consequences of the illness such as respiratory failure, organ dysfunction, and shock. Cytokine storm (also known as cytokine release syndrome (CRS)), a systemic inflammatory response that can be triggered by an infection, has been associated with the symptom progression of COVID-19. This review evaluates several published studies that have implemented Tocilizumab (TCZ), an IL-6 receptor antibody (US20120253016A1), in COVID-19 treatment. Outcomes and biomarkers of patients treated with TCZ are compared to patients treated with standard of care regimens. Interleukin6 (IL-6), a prominent inflammatory cytokine involved in CRS in various inflammatory conditions, may have a vital role in the underlying mechanism involved in debilitating SARS-CoV-2 infections and could serve as a viable treatment target. Studies suggest that TCZ may aid in the recovery of patients with COVID-19 and reduce mortality.","Ali, Afroze; Kamjani, Milad H; Kesselman, Marc M",Recent patents on anti-infective drug discovery,https://doi.org/10.2174/1574891x15666200922155712; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32962623/,344
66980,Társasági hírek.,2020-06-01,"BACKGROUND Next generation sequencing (NGS) is becoming widely used among diagnostics and research laboratories, and nowadays it is applied to a variety of disciplines, including veterinary virology. The NGS workflow comprises several steps, namely sample processing, library preparation, sequencing and primary/secondary/tertiary bioinformatics (BI) analyses. The latter is constituted by a complex process extremely difficult to standardize, due to the variety of tools and metrics available. Thus, it is of the utmost importance to assess the comparability of results obtained through different methods and in different laboratories. To achieve this goal, we have organized a proficiency test focused on the bioinformatics components for the generation of complete genome sequences of salmonid rhabdoviruses. METHODS Three partners, that performed virus sequencing using different commercial library preparation kits and NGS platforms, gathered together and shared with each other 75 raw datasets which were analyzed separately by the participants to produce a consensus sequence according to their own bioinformatics pipeline. Results were then compared to highlight discrepancies, and a subset of inconsistencies were investigated more in detail. RESULTS In total, we observed 526 discrepancies, of which 39.5% were located at genome termini, 14.1% at intergenic regions and 46.4% at coding regions. Among these, 10 SNPs and 99 indels caused changes in the protein products. Overall reproducibility was 99.94%. Based on the analysis of a subset of inconsistencies investigated more in-depth, manual curation appeared the most critical step affecting sequence comparability, suggesting that the harmonization of this phase is crucial to obtain comparable results. The analysis of a calibrator sample allowed assessing BI accuracy, being 99.983%. CONCLUSIONS We demonstrated the applicability and the usefulness of BI proficiency testing to assure the quality of NGS data, and recommend a wider implementation of such exercises to guarantee sequence data uniformity among different virology laboratories.","Zamperin, Gianpiero; Lucas, Pierrick; Cano, Irene; Ryder, David; Abbadi, Miriam; Stone, David; Cuenca, Argelia; Vigouroux, Estelle; Blanchard, Yannick; Panzarin, Valentina",Virology journal,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12985-019-1223-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31752912/,344

The aim of this study was to evaluate the feasibility and safety of transumbilical LESS adrenalectomy and to elucidate the technical differences between LESS and conventional laparoscopic surgery. METHODS This study was comparing 10 consecutive transumbilical LESS adrenalectomies and 10 conventional laparoscopic adrenalectomies performed between March 2006 and April 2010 for benign adrenal tumors. Perioperative parameters were compared, and we reviewed our surgical videos and analyzed technical characteristics of the surgeries. RESULTS There was no open conversion in laparoscopic group, no additional port placement in LESS group, and no perioperative complications in either group. No significant differences in operative time, estimated blood loss, or resumption of oral intake were observed between two groups. Pneumoperitoneum time did not differ between LESS and laparoscopic groups (91.2 vs. 74.3 min, P = 0.257). In LESS group only, time was needed for adjustment of roticulator (14.5 ± 8.1 min). After subtracting the time needed for adjustment, operative time between two groups was more comparable (76.7 vs. 74.3 min, P = 0.880). One-handed manipulation time in LESS group decreased in a time-dependent manner (r = -0.806, P < 0.0049). Tissue re-grasping during operation was more frequently observed in LESS group (16.2 vs. 2.2 times, P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS Transumbilical LESS adrenalectomy is feasible and comparable to conventional laparoscopic adrenalectomy. There are still obvious technical difficulties associated with LESS surgery, and it is essential that these be overcome in order to improve this surgical technique.","Ishida, Masaru; Miyajima, Akira; Takeda, Toshikazu; Hasegawa, Masanori; Kikuchi, Eiji; Oya, Mototsugu",World journal of urology,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00345-010-0636-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21188386/,344

METHODS Ten RYGB subjects were studied on four occasions in randomized order (sitting vs. supine posture; 50 vs. 150 ml of labelled water mixed with 3 g 3-O-methyl-D-glucose (3-OMG) and 50 g glucose). G/PE, caecal arrival time (CAT), blood glucose, plasma insulin, glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP), peptide YY (PYY), 3-OMG, blood pressure, heart rate and GI symptoms were assessed over 240 min. Controls were ten volunteers with no medical condition or previous abdominal surgery, who were studied with the 150-ml drink in the sitting position. RESULTS Compared to controls, PE (P < 0.001) and CAT (P < 0.001) were substantially more rapid in RYGB subjects. In RYGB, PE was more rapid in the sitting position (2.5 ± 0.7 vs. 16.6 ± 5.3 min, P = 0.02) and tends to be faster after 150 ml than the 50-ml drinks (9.5 ± 2.9 vs. 14.0 ± 3.5 min, P = 0.16). The sitting position and larger volume drinks were associated with greater releases of insulin, GLP-1 and PYY, as well as more hypotension (P < 0.01), tachycardia (P < 0.01) and postprandial symptoms (P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS Pouch emptying, blood pressure and GI symptoms after RYGB are dependent on both posture and meal volume.","Nguyen, Nam Q; Debreceni, Tamara L; Burgstad, Carly M; Wishart, Judith M; Bellon, Max; Rayner, Chris K; Wittert, Gary A; Horowitz, Michael",Obesity surgery,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11695-014-1531-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25502436/,344

METHODS This study is an analysis of a prospective multicenter stroke registry database from 14 hospitals in South Korea. Patients with acute noncardioembolic stroke, who were taking aspirin for prevention of ischemic events at the time of onset of stroke, were enrolled. Study subjects were divided into 3 groups according to the subsequent antiplatelet therapy strategy pursued; maintaining aspirin monotherapy (MA group), switching aspirin to nonaspirin antiplatelet agents (SA group), and adding another antiplatelet agent to aspirin (AA group). The primary study end point was the composite of stroke (ischemic and hemorrhagic), myocardial infarction, and vascular death up to 1 year after stroke onset. RESULTS A total of 1172 patients were analyzed for this study. Antiplatelet strategies pursued in study patients were MA group in 212 (18.1%), SA group in 246 (21.0%), and AA group in 714 (60.9%). The Cox proportional hazards regression analysis showed that, compared with the MA group, there was a reduction in the composite vascular event primary end point in the SA group (hazard ratio, 0.50; 95% confidence interval, 0.27-0.92; P=0.03) and in the AA group (hazard ratio, 0.40; 95% confidence interval, 0.24-0.66; P<0.001). CONCLUSIONS This study showed that, compared with maintaining aspirin, switching to or adding alternative antiplatelet agents may be better in preventing subsequent vascular events in patients who experienced a new ischemic stroke while taking aspirin.","Kim, Joon-Tae; Park, Man-Seok; Choi, Kang-Ho; Cho, Ki-Hyun; Kim, Beom Joon; Han, Moon-Ku; Park, Tai Hwan; Park, Sang-Soon; Lee, Kyung Bok; Lee, Byung-Chul; Yu, Kyung-Ho; Oh, Mi Sun; Cha, Jae Kwan; Kim, Dae-Hyun; Nah, Hyun-Wook; Lee, Jun; Lee, Soo Joo; Ko, Young-Chai; Kim, Jae Guk; Park, Jong-Moo; Kang, Kyusik; Cho, Yong-Jin; Hong, Keun-Sik; Choi, Jay Chol; Kim, Dong-Eog; Ryu, Wi-Sun; Shin, Dong-Ick; Yeo, Min-Ju; Kim, Wook-Joo; Lee, Juneyoung; Lee, Ji Sung; Saver, Jeffrey L; Bae, Hee-Joon",Stroke,https://doi.org/10.1161/strokeaha.115.011595; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26604247/,344

COVID-19, previously known as 2019 novel coronavirus, caused by SARS-CoV-2, was first reported in Wuhan, China, in late 2019, and quickly resulted in a major epidemic across the world. Although the origin of SARS-CoV-2 is not clear yet, genome sequencing results suggest that this is the third reported spillover of an animal coronavirus to humans, from 2002. The development of detection, therapeutic, and prevention strategies for COVID-19 is a fundamental task towards curing infected people and competing with the pandemic. Because of their similarities, scientists believe that treatment/detection methods similar to what were used against the illnesses caused by SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV may be effective for curing/detecting COVID-19. Here, we review the recent nanotechnology techniques used for treating and testing SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2, and potential therapeutic options for curing COVID-19.","Abedini-Nassab, Roozbeh; Mahdaviyan, Naeemeh",Recent patents on nanotechnology,https://doi.org/10.2174/1872210514666201110125536; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33172382/,344
68486,"The Impact of Population, Contact, and Spatial Heterogeneity on Epidemic Model Predictions.",2016,"Networks of species interactions underpin numerous ecosystem processes, but comprehensively sampling these interactions is difficult. Interactions intrinsically vary across space and time, and given the number of species that compose ecological communities, it can be tough to distinguish between a true negative (where two species never interact) from a false negative (where two species have not been observed interacting even though they actually do). Assessing the likelihood of interactions between species is an imperative for several fields of ecology. This means that to predict interactions between species-and to describe the structure, variation, and change of the ecological networks they form-we need to rely on modelling tools. Here, we provide a proof-of-concept, where we show how a simple neural network model makes accurate predictions about species interactions given limited data. We then assess the challenges and opportunities associated with improving interaction predictions, and provide a conceptual roadmap forward towards predictive models of ecological networks that is explicitly spatial and temporal. We conclude with a brief primer on the relevant methods and tools needed to start building these models, which we hope will guide this research programme forward.

Disease severity varies among individuals. SARS-CoV-2 infection can be associated with e.g. flu-like symptoms, dyspnoea, severe interstitial pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, multiorgan dysfunction, and generalized coagulopathy. Nitric oxide (NO), is a small signal molecule that impacts pleiotropic functions in human physiology, which can be involved in the significant effects of COVID-19 infection. NO is a neurotransmitter involved in the neural olfactory processes in the central nervous system, and some infected patients have reported anosmia as a symptom. Additionally, NO is a well-known vasodilator, important coagulation mediator, anti-microbial effector and inhibitor of SARS-CoV replication. Exhaled NO is strongly related to the type-2 inflammatory response found in asthma, which has been suggested to be protective against SARS-CoV-2 infection. Several reports indicate that the use of inhaled NO has been an effective therapy during this pandemic since the ventilation-perfusion ratio in COVID-19 patients improved afterwards and they did not require mechanical ventilation. The aim of this mini-review is to summarize relevant actions of NO that could be beneficial in the treatment of COVID-19.","Ricciardolo, Fabio Luigi Massimo; Bertolini, Francesca; Carriero, Vitina; Högman, Marieann",Journal of breath research,https://doi.org/10.1088/1752-7163/abc302; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33080582/,344

There is a need to develop more mental health services with trans-formative changes to mitigate the obnoxious post-pandemic effects. Secondly, the implementation of online therapeutic interventions must be available prior or after pandemic situation. Thirdly, as the pharmacy and mental health services in Pakistan are not capable to meet the international standards to provide patient care. Therefore, the advanced researchers are needed to investigate the fractures and gaps in social, economic and health care systems.

Since the turn of the 21st century, the minimally invasive approach and in particular totally extraperitoneal (TEP) repair has gained in popularity. The concept of the TEP approach combines the advantages of anterior tension-free mesh repair (Lichtenstein repair) and the open preperitoneal approach championed by Stoppa. TEP repair uses a prosthetic mesh significantly bigger than in open herniorrhaphy, offering a complete overlap of the myopectineal orifice. TEP repair is a challenging technique with unfamiliar anatomy, a limited operative field, and long learning curve.

Based on data from a field experiment, this article investigates the extent to which hiring discrimination limits the job opportunities of young applicants who disclose a history of mental health problems. From September 2019 to December 2020, 1398 job applications were sent in pairs to 699 employers with job openings in a broad selection of occupations in the Norwegian labour market. The applicants were equally qualified except that, in each pair, one applicant informed about mental health problems as an explanation for a past employment break. The results show that applicants who disclose mental health problems are discriminated against in hiring processes. Applicants with mental health problems have about 27% lower probability of receiving an invitation to a job interview and about 22% lower probability of receiving any positive employer response. These results do not seem to have been driven by the COVID-19 crisis that unfolded during the course of the study. As such, the study provides suggestive evidence that uncertain economic times might not necessarily increase the level of discrimination against applicants with mental health problems.","Bjørnshagen, Vegar",Social science & medicine,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.socscimed.2021.114181; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34216884/,344

DESIGN Two group large animal model of CO poisoning. SETTING Laboratory. SUBJECTS Ten swine were divided into two groups: Control (n = 4) and CO (n = 6). INTERVENTIONS Administration of a low dose of CO at 200 ppm to the CO group over 90 min followed by 30 min of re-oxygenation at room air. The Control group received room air for 120 min. MEASUREMENTS Non-invasive optical monitoring was used to measure cerebral blood flow and oxygenation. Cerebral microdialysis was performed to obtain semi real time measurements of cerebral metabolic status. At the end of the exposure, both fresh brain (cortical and hippocampal tissue) and heart (apical tissue) were immediately harvested to measure mitochondrial respiration and reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and blood was collected to assess plasma cytokine concentrations. MAIN RESULTS Animals in the CO group showed significantly decreased Complex IV-linked mitochondrial respiration in hippocampal and apical heart tissue but not cortical tissue. There also was a significant increase in mitochondrial ROS generation across all measured tissue types. The CO group showed a significantly higher cerebral lactate-to-pyruvate ratio. Both IL-8 and TNFα were significantly increased in the CO group compared with the Control group obtained from plasma. While not significant there was a trend to an increase in optically measured cerebral blood flow and hemoglobin concentration in the CO group. CONCLUSIONS Low-dose CO poisoning is associated with early mitochondrial disruption prior to an observable phenotype highlighting the important role of mitochondrial function in the pathology of CO poisoning. This may represent an important intervenable pathway for therapy and intervention.","Jang, David H; Piel, Sarah; Greenwood, John C; Kelly, Matthew; Mazandi, Vanessa M; Ranganathan, Abhay; Lin, Yuxi; Starr, Jonathan; Hallowell, Thomas; Shofer, Frances S; Baker, Wesley B; Lafontant, Alec; Andersen, Kristen; Ehinger, Johannes K; Kilbaugh, Todd J",Clinical toxicology,https://doi.org/10.1080/15563650.2020.1870691; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33529085/,344

METHODS Data from three clinical studies with measured tracheal lengths were pooled in a database including 422 children aged from birth to 16 yr. Dimensional data of seven cuffed paediatric tracheal tube brands (ID 3.0-7.0 mm) were recorded. Positions of tracheal tube tip and upper cuff border were calculated for each of the 422 tracheas using depth mark based tracheal tube placement, placement of the tracheal tube tip at a calculated safety distance above the carina, and mid-tracheal tube placement. Percentage of accidental bronchial intubations and tracheal tube cuff positions in the subglottic or supraglottic region were calculated. RESULTS Depth mark based tracheal tube placement resulted in accidental bronchial intubation of up to 18% of cases and tracheal tube cuffs being placed in the subglottic region in up to 91%. Tracheal tube tip placement at a calculated safety distance resulted in up to 54% of tube cuffs placed too high. Mid-tracheal tube placement led to 100% subglottic or supraglottic tracheal tube cuff positions. CONCLUSIONS All studied cuffed paediatric tracheal tubes have major design flaws potentially leading to airway complications. Tracheal tube manufacturers are urgently asked to improve the design of cuffed paediatric tracheal tubes. Alternative strategies for tracheal tube placement can allow safe tracheal tube placement of uncuffed but not of cuffed tracheal tubes.","Kemper, M; Imach, S; Buehler, P K; Thomas, J; Dave, M; Weiss, M",British journal of anaesthesia,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bja.2018.05.002; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30032890/,344

METHODS A systematic review was executed using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analysis (PRISMA) guidelines. To identify articles related to COVID-19 and CHD, an extensive literature search was performed on EMBASE, Medline, Scopus, and Global Health databases using keywords and MeSH terms. RESULTS A total of 12 articles met the inclusion criteria and were included for analysis in this systematic review. Two themes were identified for data extraction: evidence supporting higher risks in CHD patients and evidence against higher risks in CHD patients. After combining the data, there were 99 patients with CHDs out of which 12 required admissions to ICU. CONCLUSION This systematic review suggests that CHD may increase the risk of poor outcomes for those with COVID-19, but also highlights the necessity for more research with larger sample sizes in order to make a more justified conclusion, as the majority of papers that were analysed were case series and case reports.

These mAbs were found to recognise specifically the haemagglutinin (HA) epitope of the influenza H5 subtypes by western blotting with recombinant HAs; however, these mAbs have no neutralising activity for A/duck/Hokkaido/84/02 (H5N3) or A/Puerto Ric/8/34 (H1N1). Each epitope of these mAbs was a conformational epitope that was formed from the regions located between 46 to 60 amino acids (aa) and 312 to 322 aa for IFH5-115, from 101 to 113 aa and 268 to 273 aa for IFH5-136 and from 61 to 80 aa and 290 to 300 aa for IFH5-26. The epitopes were located in the loop regions between the receptor region and alpha-helix structure in haemagglutinin 1 (HA1). Influenza A virus H5-specific rapid immunochromatographic test kits were tested as solid phase antibody/alkaline phosphate-conjugated mAb in the following three combinations: IFH5-26/IFH5-115, IFH5-136/IFH5-26 and IFH5-136/IFH5-115.

For effective clinical application, rapid dual discrimination immunochromatographic test kits in combination with H5 HA-specific mAb, IFA5-26 and IFA5-115 and the influenza A NP NP-specific mAb, FVA2-11, were developed. The dual discrimination immunochromatographic tests kits detected influenza A virus H5 subtypes as H5 line-positive and all influenza A subtypes as A line-positive simultaneously. The dual discrimination immunochromatographic test kits may be useful for discriminating highly pathogenic avian influenza A H5N1 viruses from seasonal influenza A virus, as well as for confirming influenza infection status in human, avian and mammalian hosts.","Miyagawa, Eiji; Kogaki, Hiroyuki; Uchida, Yoshiaki; Fujii, Nobuyuki; Shirakawa, Takashi; Sakoda, Yoshihrio; Kida, Hiroshi",Journal of virological methods,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jviromet.2011.02.007; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21335030/,344

How have prior experiences with managing HIV prepared countries for COVID-19? To what extent has the structure of the global health field enabled or constrained countries' ability to respond? Drawing on qualitative methods, this article examines the impact of HIV interventions on the healthcare system in Malawi and its implications for addressing COVID-19. I argue that the historical and continued influence of neoliberalism in global health manifests in the structures and routines of clinical practice. In Malawi's health centres, a parallel NGO system of care has become grafted onto state healthcare, with NGOs managing HIV commodities and providing care to HIV patients. While HIV NGOs do support the work of government providers, it is limited to tasks that align with their programmatic goals. Outside of donor priorities, the conditions of public healthcare are left behind, and government providers struggle with shortages of staff, medical resources, and basic infrastructure. In the context of COVID-19, risks are compounded as public healthcare facilities not only struggle with resources to treat patients, but also become a site of risk itself for COVID-19 infection.","Zhou, Amy",Global public health,https://doi.org/10.1080/17441692.2021.1940237; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34148531/,344
83075,Cusp Universality for Random Matrices I: Local Law and the Complex Hermitian Case.,2020,"BACKGROUND Although commercially available analgesic indices based on biosignal processing have been used to quantify nociception during general anesthesia, their performance is low in conscious patients. Therefore, there is a need to develop a new analgesic index with improved performance to quantify postoperative pain in conscious patients. OBJECTIVE This study aimed to develop a new analgesic index using photoplethysmogram (PPG) spectrograms and a convolutional neural network (CNN) to objectively assess pain in conscious patients. METHODS PPGs were obtained from a group of surgical patients for 6 minutes both in the absence (preoperatively) and in the presence (postoperatively) of pain. Then, the PPG data of the latter 5 minutes were used for analysis. Based on the PPGs and a CNN, we developed a spectrogram-CNN index for pain assessment. The area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver-operating characteristic curve was measured to evaluate the performance of the 2 indices. RESULTS PPGs from 100 patients were used to develop the spectrogram-CNN index. When there was pain, the mean (95% CI) spectrogram-CNN index value increased significantly-baseline: 28.5 (24.2-30.7) versus recovery area: 65.7 (60.5-68.3); P<.01. The AUC and balanced accuracy were 0.76 and 71.4%, respectively. The spectrogram-CNN index cutoff value for detecting pain was 48, with a sensitivity of 68.3% and specificity of 73.8%. CONCLUSIONS Although there were limitations to the study design, we confirmed that the spectrogram-CNN index can efficiently detect postoperative pain in conscious patients. Further studies are required to assess the spectrogram-CNN index's feasibility and prevent overfitting to various populations, including patients under general anesthesia.

However, it remains unclear how the impulse dispersion varies with different types of articulation, intensity levels of diction, or body position. Furthermore, it has not been understood in detail how to prevent aerosol dispersion during singing. MATERIAL AND METHODS Single professional singers from the Bavarian Radio Chorus were asked to sing in different head positions, with different articulation patterns and different masks after inhaling the basic liquid of an e-cigarette. The vapor cloud was segmented and tracked over time. RESULTS Consonants and exaggeration of diction enhanced the distance reached by the impulse dispersion. Furthermore, the greatest dispersion was reached for a neutral head position. All protection masks stopped the initial jet of the aerosols but the FFP2 masks were the most effective. CONCLUSION Some protection equipment has been identified to be promising in reducing aerosol dispersion. However, systematic effects have to be evaluated in greater collectives.","Westphalen, Caroline; Kniesburges, Stefan; Veltrup, Reinhard; Gantner, Sophia; Peters, Gregor; Benthaus, Tobias; Jakubaß, Bernhard; Köberlein, Marie; Döllinger, Michael; Echternach, Matthias",Journal of voice : official journal of the Voice Foundation,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jvoice.2021.03.013; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33849763/,344

However, no studies have been conducted to investigate its anticancer potential, particularly its extracted oil. PURPOSE The present study was put forth to appraise the anticancer potential of Parrotiopsis jacquemontiana extracted oil against liver (hcclm3 and hepg2) and breast cancer (mda-mb 231 and mcf-7) cell lines relative to normal cell lines (lo2 and mcf-10a) via MTT assay. METHODS Flow cytometry indicated the apoptotic effect whereas invasion and migration capabilities of oil against cancer cells were determined by Matrigel invasion chamber and wound-scratch assays. RESULTS The results of oil revealed a time and dose-dependent increase in cell proliferation inhibition, conferring to least IC50 shown against hcclm3 (144.9 ± 0.75 μg/ml) and mda-mb 231 (145.7 ± 0.32 μg/ml) cell line at 72 h, whereas no cytotoxic effect on normal cells was observed. In addition, the oil significantly (p < 0.001) suppressed the migration and invasion of hcclm3 and mda-mb 231 cells, showing noteworthy anti-metastatic potential. Furthermore, cell death was confirmed by Annexin‒V/PI staining where the maximum apoptotic percentage was calculated for oil (200 μg/ml) alongside mda-mb 231 conferring to 15.36 ± 1.22, 26.7 ± 1.2, and 36.43 ± 1.65 at 24, 48, and 72 h whereas 12.33 ± 1.05, 19.36 ± 1.62, and 29.3 ± 0.79 was recorded alongside hcclm3 at similar time intervals, respectively. CONCLUSION In conclusion, the extracted oil exhibited strong anti-proliferative, anti-metastatic, and apoptotic effects and therefore may have potential applications in cancer treatment, however, further studies of oil regarding the action mechanisms and compounds involved in anticancer therapy are necessary.","Ali, Saima; Khan, Muhammad Rashid; Khan, Asghar; Khan, Raees",Phytomedicine : international journal of phytotherapy and phytopharmacology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.phymed.2021.153697; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34399165/,344

METHODS Between July 2001 and December 2007, 100 patients with RCC underwent laparoscopic radical nephrectomy at our institution for clinically localized RCC. Fifty-three patients received a retroperitoneal procedure and 47 received a transperitoneal procedure. The perioperative and oncological outcomes of these groups were reviewed retrospectively. RESULTS Mean follow up was 34 months. No statistically significant difference was found between the two approaches in terms of pathological stage, operative time, need for additional procedures such as adrenalectomy and/or lymph node sampling, estimated blood loss, need for blood transfusions, analgesic requirement, length of hospital stay, or the incidence of minor or major complications. The 5-year disease-free survival rate was 90% for both the retroperitoneal and transperitoneal procedures. The 5-year overall survival rates were 98% and 96%, respectively. Therefore, no significant difference was observed in the long-term oncological outcome between the two groups.

In order to protect our limited critical care capacity, we rapidly developed a new ward-based inpatient continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) service with direct input from the respiratory, infectious diseases and critical care teams. Close collaboration between these specialties and new innovative solutions were required to facilitate this. CPAP equipment (normally reserved for domiciliary care) was adapted to reduce the pressure on our strained oxygen infrastructure. Side rooms on the infectious diseases ward were swiftly converted into new negative pressure areas using temporary installed ventilatory equipment, reducing the viral aerosol risk for staff. Novel patient monitoring solutions were used to protect staff while also ensuring patient safety. Staff training and specialist oversight was organised within days.

88932,Advice P.R.N.,2020-09-01,"Sclerosing cholangitis, characterized by biliary inflammation, fibrosis, and stricturing, remains one of the most challenging conditions of clinical hepatology. Geniposide (GE) has anti-inflammatory, hepatoprotective, and cholagogic effects. Whether GE provides inhibition on the development of sclerosing cholangitis is unknown. Here, we investigated the role of GE in a mouse model in which mice were fed with 3,5-diethoxycarbonyl-1,4-dihydrocollidine (DDC) for 4 weeks to induce sclerosing cholangitis. The results demonstrated that the increased hepatic gene expressions of pro-inflammatory (IL-6, VCAM-1, MCP-1, and F4/80) and profibrogenic markers (Col1α1, Col1α2, TGF-β, and α-SMA) in DDC feeding mice were reversed after treatment with GE. GE also suppressed expressions of CK19 and Ki67 in DDC-fed mice, suggesting that GE could ameliorate DDC-induced hepatocytes and cholangiocytes proliferation. In addition, GE significantly increased bile acids (BAs) secretion in bile, which correlated with induced expressions of hepatic FXR, BAs secretion transporters (BSEP, MRP2, MDR1, and MDR2), and reduced CYP7A1 mRNA expression. Furthermore, higher expressions of ileal FXR-FGF15 signaling and reduced ASBT were also observed after GE treatment. Taken together, these data showed that GE could modulate inflammation, fibrosis, and BAs homeostasis in DDC-fed mice, which lead to efficiently delay the progression of sclerosing cholangitis.","Wen, Min; Liu, Yubei; Chen, Ruiying; He, Ping; Wu, Feihua; Li, Rui; Lin, Yining",Phytotherapy research : PTR,https://doi.org/10.1002/ptr.7086; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33763888/,344

The goal of this work was the development, characterization, and evaluation of the cytocompatibility of otoliths-incorporated sodium alginate and gelatin scaffolds. Cynoscion acoupa-derived otoliths were characterized by X-ray fluorescence spectrometry (FRX), particle size, free lime, and weight loss by calcination. Furthermore, otoliths were incorporated into sodium alginate (ALG/OTL-s) or gelatin (GEL/OTL-s) scaffolds, previously developed by freeze-drying. Then, the scaffolds were characterized by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA/DTG), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), infrared spectroscopy with Fourier transform (FTIR), swelling tests, and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Cytotoxicity assays were run against J774.G8 macrophages and MC3T3-E1 osteoblasts. Data obtained from TGA/DTG, DSC, and FTIR analyses confirmed the interaction between otoliths and the polymeric scaffolds. SEM showed the homogeneous porous 3D structure rich in otolith micro-fragments in both scaffolds. Swelling of the GEL/OTL-s (63.54 ± 3.0%) was greater than of ALG/OTL-s (13.36 ± 9.9%) (p < 0.001). The viability of J774.G8 macrophages treated with both scaffolds was statistically similar to the group treated with DMEM only (p > 0.05) and significantly higher than that treated with Triton-X (p < 0.01) at 72 h. Both scaffolds showed approximately 100% growth of MC3T3-E1 osteoblasts by 24 h, similarly to control (p > 0.05). However, by 48 h, only ALG/OTL-s showed growth similar to control (p > 0.05), whereas GEL/OTL showed a significantly lower growth index (p < 0.05). In conclusion, the physicochemical profiles suggest proper interaction between the otoliths and the two developed polymeric 3D scaffolds. Moreover, both materials showed cytocompatibility with J774.G8 macrophages but the growth of MC3T3-E1 osteoblasts was higher when exposed to ALG/OTL-s. These data suggest that sodium alginate/otoliths scaffolds are potential biomaterials to be used in bone regeneration applications.

89201,Artists explore new ways of knowing in a time of information overload.,2020-06-01,"AIM The feasibility and outcome of sphincter-saving resection for rectal cancer were assessed in patients previously treated by high-dose radiotherapy for prostate cancer. METHOD Between 2000 and 2012, 1066 patients underwent rectal excision for rectal cancer. Of these, 236 were treated by conventional radiotherapy (45 Gy) and sphincter-saving resection (Group A) and 12 were treated by external-beam radiotherapy (EBRT) for prostate cancer (70 Gy) and sphincter-saving resection (Group B) of whom five had a metachronous and seven a synchronous cancer. The end-points were surgical morbidity, pelvic sepsis, reoperation and definitive stoma. RESULTS Tumour characteristics were similar in both groups. Surgical morbidity (67% vs 25%, P = 0.004), anastomotic leakage (50% vs 10%, P = 0.001, and reoperation (50% vs 17%, P = 0.011) were significantly higher in Group B. Multivariate analyses showed that EBRT for prostate cancer was the only independent factor for anastomotic leakage (OR = 5.12; 95% CI 1.45-18.08; P = 0.011) and definitive stoma (OR = 10.56; 95% CI 3.02-39.92; P < 0.001). CONCLUSION High-dose radiotherapy for prostate cancer increases morbidity from rectal surgery and the risk of a permanent stoma. This suggests that a delayed coloanal anastomosis or a Hartmann procedure should be proposed as an alternative to low anterior resection in this population.","Buscail, E; Blondeau, V; Adam, J-P; Pontallier, A; Laurent, C; Rullier, E; Denost, Q",Colorectal disease : the official journal of the Association of Coloproctology of Great Britain and Ireland,https://doi.org/10.1111/codi.12962; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25824545/,344

Sarah Hallett.,2020-03-30,"BACKGROUND Over the past decade, the Glasgow prognostic score (GPS), which is based on serum C-reactive protein and albumin levels, has been reported to be associated with the prognosis of patients with several types of inoperable and operable cancers. However, its applicability to operable non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) has not yet been established. METHODS We retrospectively collected data from patients with pathological stage I or II NSCLC who underwent complete resection. A total of 1048 patients were categorized as either GPS-0 (n = 817 [78.0%]), GPS-1 (184 [17.6%]), or GPS-2 (47 [4.5%]). Survival curves were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method, and the Cox proportional hazard model was used to analyze the relationship between prognosis and GPS status. RESULTS The 5-year overall survival (OS) rates were 91.2%, 78.3%, and 75.8% for GPS-0, GPS-1, and GPS-2, respectively. There were significant differences in OS between GPS-0 and GPS-1 (p < 0.001) and between GPS-0 and GPS-2 (p < 0.001). Ten variables demonstrated to be associated with OS in a univariate analysis were subjected to a multivariate analysis. The results showed that male sex (p = 0.031), vascular invasion (p < 0.001), lymph node metastasis (p < 0.001), and GPS (p = 0.025) were significantly associated with OS. CONCLUSIONS A high GPS is significantly associated with poor OS. Although the biological mechanism that underlies this association is not clear, this inflammation-based score may be a useful indicator of the prognosis in patients with resectable NSCLC.","Yotsukura, Masaya; Ohtsuka, Takashi; Kaseda, Kaoru; Kamiyama, Ikuo; Hayashi, Yuichiro; Asamura, Hisao",Journal of thoracic oncology : official publication of the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jtho.2016.04.029; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27234603/,344

There are limited data on other infectious disease comorbidities in patients with PN. OBJECTIVE To characterize infectious disease hospitalizations among patients with PN and the associated cost burden. METHODS We searched the 2016-2017 National Inpatient Sample, a cross-sectional sample of 20% of all U.S. hospitalizations, for infectious disease hospitalizations among patients with PN. Associations of PN with infections and related costs were determined using multivariable logistic and linear regression adjusting for age, race, sex, and insurance type. RESULTS PN was associated with any infection overall (OR 2.98, 95% CI: 2.49 - 3.56), as well as sepsis, HIV, cutaneous, hepatobiliary, CNS, bacterial, viral, and fungal/parasitic infections. PN patients had a higher mean cost of care ($11,667 vs. $8,893, P<0.001) and length of stay (5.5 days vs. 4.2 days, P<0.001) for any infection overall and 7 of 13 other infections. Adjusting for age, race, sex, and insurance coverage, PN was associated with higher cost (+30%, 95% CI: +17% - +44%) and higher length of stay (+30%, 95% CI: +18% - +44%) for any infection overall, as well as several other infections. These associations remained with alternate regression models adjusting for severity of illness. CONCLUSIONS There is a high infectious disease burden among PN patients, corresponding to higher healthcare utilization and spending.

DESIGN Prospectively collected data regarding the function of the pelvic organs. SETTING Tertiary endometriosis referral unit, Aarhus University Hospital. SAMPLE A cohort of 128 patients who underwent laparoscopic bowel resection for endometriosis. METHODS The International Consultation on Incontinence Questionnaire (ICIQ), Sexual Function-Vaginal Changes Questionnaire (SVQ), and the Low Anterior Resection Syndrome (LARS) questionnaire were answered before and after surgery. Non-invasive urodynamic testing was performed. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Pre- and postoperative function of the pelvic organs was compared, and risk factors for improved/impaired function were identified. RESULTS A total of 96.1% of the women completed the 1-year follow-up. A significant decrease (P = 0.002) in bladder filling problems (F-score) was observed 1 year after surgery, primarily caused by a significant decrease in bladder pain (P = 0.0001). No change for urodynamic parameters was observed. A significant increase in overall sexual satisfaction (P = 0.0001) and decrease in worries about sexual life (P = 0.001) was seen 1 year after surgery. Frequency of defecation was significantly increased 1 year after surgery (P = 0.0001), but the overall bowel function measured by LARS score was unchanged. Patients with anastomotic leakage had a significantly higher risk (odds ratio, OR 5.40; P = 0.002) of increased incontinence problems (I-score) 1 year after surgery. CONCLUSION A significant and clinically relevant improvement in urinary and sexual function 1 year after laparoscopic bowel resection for endometriosis was found. Except for anastomotic leakage, this could be observed independent of any patient- or treatment-related factor.

However, it is rare in the pediatric population with familial aggregation. CASE PRESENTATION A 3-year-old boy presented with pain and irritation on the oral mucosa while contacting spicy food for 2 months. Oral examination showed widespread whitish reticular and papular lesions on the lips, the dorsum of the tongue, and bilateral buccal mucosa, with diffuse erosions covered with pseudomembrane on the buccal mucosa. The boy's parents were examined to exhibit white reticular and plaque-like lesions on their oral mucosa. The three patients were clinically diagnosed as affected by OLP and histopathologically confirmed. The boy underwent topical treatment with recombinant bovine basic fibroblast growth factor (rb-bFGF) gel, and oral lesions gradually resolved and healed. Neither of his parents received treatment. During the subsequent follow-ups, none of three patients underwent any medical treatment. Fortunately, their lesions had almost faded over 8 years. CONCLUSIONS Our case emphasizes that pediatric OLP should be recorded with family history. Besides, long-term periodic follow-up is recommended in pediatric patients with OLP for monitoring any changes in lesions.","Wang, Fang; Tan, Ya-Qin; Zhang, Jing; Zhou, Gang",BMC oral health,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12903-020-01333-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33243193/,344

On the other hand, symptomatic children had significantly higher levels of C-reactive protein (2.8 (IQR: 1.2-10.0) mg/L vs. 1.4 (IQR: 0.4-2.0) mg/L, p=0.011); and procalcitonin (0.05 (IQR: 0.02-0.10) ng/mL vs. 0.01 (IQR: 0.00-0.03) ng/mL, p<0.001) than those without symptoms. One of the children with cerebral palsy died from pneumonia during the study. CONCLUSION C-reactive protein, procalcitonin and NLR levels were found to be significantly higher in symptomatic children. NLR can be suggested as a potential marker associated with disease severity in COVID-19 patients, which needs to be supported by other studies.

91840,Analysis and optimal control of an HIV model based on CD4 count.,2020-06-30,"OBJECTIVE Regional differences were investigated in quantitative EEG (QEEG) characteristics and associations of QEEG to hemodynamics after pediatric acute stroke. METHODS Quantitative EEG was analyzed, including power in delta, theta, alpha, and beta bands, alpha-delta power ratio, total power, and spectral edge frequency from 11 children with unilateral, anterior circulation strokes during the first 24 hours of continuous EEG recording. Differences between injured and uninjured hemispheres were assessed using multivariate dynamic structural equations modeling. Dynamic structural equations modeling was applied to six children with hemorrhagic stroke undergoing arterial blood pressure, heart rate, and cerebral oximetry monitoring to investigate associations between hemodynamics with QEEG adjacent to anterior circulation regions. RESULTS All patients with acute ischemic stroke (n = 5) had lower alpha and beta power and spectral edge frequency on injured compared with uninjured regions. This was not consistent after hemorrhagic stroke (n = 6). All hemorrhagic stroke patients demonstrated negative association of total power with arterial blood pressure within injured regions. No consistency was observed for direction or strength of association in other QEEG measures to arterial blood pressure nor were such consistent relationships observed for any QEEG measure studied in relation to heart rate or cerebral oximetry. CONCLUSIONS After pediatric anterior circulation acute ischemic stroke, reduced spectral edge frequency and alpha and beta power can be observed on injured as compared with noninjured regions. After pediatric anterior circulation hemorrhagic stroke, total power can be negatively associated with arterial blood pressure within injured regions. Larger studies are needed to understand conditions in which QEEG patterns manifest and relate to hemodynamics and brain penumbra.","Appavu, Brian L; Temkit, M'hamed H; Foldes, Stephen T; Burrows, Brian T; Jacobson, Austin M; Mangum, Tara K; Boerwinkle, Varina L; Marku, Iris; Abruzzo, Todd A; Adelson, Phillip D",Journal of clinical neurophysiology : official publication of the American Electroencephalographic Society,https://doi.org/10.1097/wnp.0000000000000813; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33417384/,344

This retrospective study aimed to determine if a disparity exists between the two alternative routes in hemodialysis patients in terms of outcomes of TDCs. METHODS 49 hemodialysis patients who required TDCs through right EJV (n = 21) or left IJV (n = 28) as long-term vascular access were included in this study. The primary end point was cumulative catheter patency. Secondary end points include primary catheter patency, proportion of patients that never required urokinase and incidence of catheter-related bloodstream infections (CRBSI). RESULTS A total of 20,870 catheter-days were evaluated and the median was 384 (interquartile range, 262-605) catheter-days. Fewer catheters were removed in the right EJV group than in the left IJV group (P = 0.007). Mean cumulative catheter patency was higher in the right EJV group compared with the left IJV group (P = 0.031). There was no significant difference between the two groups in the incidence of CRBSI, primary catheter patency or proportion of patients that never required urokinase use. Total indwell time of antecedent catheters was identified as an independent risk factor for cumulative catheter patency by Cox regression hazards test with an HR of 2.212 (95% CI, 1.363-3.588; p = 0.001). CONCLUSIONS Right EJV might be superior to left IJV as an alternative insertion route for TDC placement in hemodialysis patients whose right IJVs are unavailable.","Wang, Pei; Wang, Yufei; Qiao, Yingjin; Zhou, Sijie; Liang, Xianhui; Liu, Zhangsuo",PloS one,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0146411; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26751380/,344
93826,The face mask wars.,2021-06-28,"COVID-19 is devastating health systems globally and causing severe ventilator shortages. Since the beginning of the outbreak, the provision and use of ventilators has been a key focus of public discourse. Scientists and engineers from leading universities and companies have rushed to develop low-cost ventilators in hopes of supporting critically ill patients in developing countries. Philanthropists have invested millions in shipping ventilators to low-resource settings, and agencies such as the World Health Organization and the World Bank are prioritizing the purchase of ventilators. While we recognize the humanitarian nature of these efforts, merely shipping ventilators to low-resource environments may not improve outcomes of patients and could potentially cause harm. An ecosystem of considerable technological and human resources is required to support the usage of ventilators within intensive care settings. Medical-grade oxygen supplies, reliable electricity, bioengineering support, and consumables are all needed for ventilators to save lives. However, most ICUs in resource-poor settings do not have access to these resources. Patients on ventilators require continuous monitoring from physicians, nurses, and respiratory therapists skilled in critical care. Health care workers in many low-resource settings are already exceedingly overburdened, and pulling these essential human resources away from other critical patient needs could reduce the overall quality of patient care. When deploying medical devices, it is vital to align the technological intervention with the clinical reality. Low-income settings often will not benefit from resource-intensive equipment, but rather from contextually appropriate devices that meet the unique needs of their health systems.","Mantena, Sreekar; Rogo, Khama; Burke, Thomas F",Respiratory care,https://doi.org/10.4187/respcare.08185; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32879035/,344
93848,How COVID is changing the study of human behaviour.,2021-05-01,"Background Patients with impaired lung function or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are considered high-risk for intubated general anesthesia, which may preclude them from surgical treatment of their lung cancers. We evaluated the feasibility of non-intubated video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) for the surgical management of lung cancer in patients with impaired pulmonary function. Methods From August 2009 to June 2015, 28 patients with impaired lung function (preoperative forced expiratory volume in 1 second <70% of the predicted value) underwent non-intubated VATS using a combination of thoracic epidural anesthesia or intercostal nerve block, and intra-thoracic vagal block with target-controlled sedation. Results Eighteen patients had primary lung cancers, 4 had metastatic lung cancers, and 6 had non-malignant lung tumors. In the patients with primary lung cancer, lobectomy was performed in 4, segmentectomy in 3 and wedge resection in 11, with lymph node sampling adequate for staging. One patient required conversion to intubated one-lung ventilation because of persistent wheezing and labored breathing. Five patients developed air leaks more than 5 days postoperatively while subcutaneous emphysema occurred in 6 patients. Two patients developed acute exacerbations of pre-existing COPD, and new-onset atrial fibrillation after surgery occurred in 1 patient. The median duration of postoperative chest tube drainage was 3 days while the median hospital stay was 6 days. Conclusions Non-intubated VATS resection for pulmonary tumors is technically feasible. It may be applied as an alternative to intubated general anesthesia in managing lung cancer in selected patients with impaired pulmonary function.","Wang, Man-Ling; Hung, Ming-Hui; Hsu, Hsao-Hsun; Chan, Kuang-Cheng; Cheng, Ya-Jung; Chen, Jin-Shing",Annals of translational medicine,https://doi.org/10.21037/atm.2018.11.58; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30906744/,344

PURPOSE A barrier to using organs from hepatitis C virus (HCV)-viremic donors is the high cost of direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) and concerns about access for recipients after transplantation. The purpose of this study was to evaluate access, cost, and timing for HCV DAAs following transplantation. METHODS This was a single-center, retrospective study of HCV-negative adult transplant recipients from June 2017 to December 2019 who received grafts from HCV-viremic and/or HCV-seropositive individuals and became HCV viremic after transplantation. RESULTS Between June 2017 and December 2019, there were 60 HCV-negative transplant recipients who became viremic after receiving grafts from HCV-viremic or HCV-seropositive donors. Thirty-eight patients met the inclusion criteria (n = 25 with liver transplants, n = 6 with lung transplants, n = 4 with simultaneous liver and kidney transplants, and n = 3 with kidney transplants). Of these patients, 23 had commercial insurance, 13 had Medicare, and 2 had Medicaid. All patients ultimately received insurance coverage for treatment; however, 36 (95%) required prior authorization and 9 (24%) required appeals to obtain insurance coverage. The median time from DAA prescription to insurance approval was 6 days. The median time from transplantation to start of treatment was 29 days (range, 0-84 days). Patients with Medicaid insurance had a significantly longer time to insurance approval (31.5 vs 6 days, P = 0.007). The average out-of-pocket cost to patients was less than $10 a month after patient assistance.All patients who completed treatment and 12-week follow-up after treatment achieved a sustained virologic response (n = 36). CONCLUSION In this study, all HCV-negative recipients who developed HCV following transplantation had access to DAA therapy, with the majority starting treatment in the first month after transplantation.","Bova, Sarah; Cameron, Andrew; Durand, Christine; Katzianer, Jennifer; LeGrand, Meighan; Boyer, Lauren; Glorioso, Jaime; Toman, Lindsey P",American journal of health-system pharmacy : AJHP : official journal of the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists,https://doi.org/10.1093/ajhp/zxab207; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33987658/,344

In times of threat and very real danger, these two parental goals come into conflict. This article articulates the confusion of intentions amidst the pandemic. It alludes to previous crises such as happened in both World Wars to protect children including Operation Pied Piper to evacuate them from London in World War 2. The aim of this paper is to give parents and clinicians an awareness of the child's and young person's point of view, in particular, the worry of children for parents. The burden on children of fearing that they may infect parents, grandparents and loved ones generally is considerable. Parents who deny what is happening lack credibility. Parents who fail to manage their own anxieties burden their children with burdens they themselves cannot bear. Honesty about the need for safety and courage as parents to promote calm are what good parents have been doing throughout history. Telling children what they are doing that is right helps them to know what 'the right' is.

Traditional approaches for pathogen detection, however, often require time-intensive bacterial culture and amplification procedures. Herein, a microparticle enhanced double-stranded DNA probe is demonstrated for rapid species-specific detection of bacterial 16S rRNA. In this molecular assay, the binding of the target sequence to the fluorophore conjugated probe thermodynamically displaces the quencher probe and allows the fluorophore to fluoresce. By incorporation of streptavidin-coated microparticles to localize the biotinylated probes, the sensitivity of the assay can be improved by 3 orders of magnitude. The limit of detection of the assay is as few as eight bacteria without target amplification and is highly specific against other common pathogens. Its applicability toward clinical diagnostics is demonstrated by directly identifying bacterial pathogens in urine samples from patients with urinary tract infections.","Riahi, Reza; Mach, Kathleen E; Mohan, Ruchika; Liao, Joseph C; Wong, Pak Kin",Analytical chemistry,https://doi.org/10.1021/ac2012575; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21718053/,344

We aimed to evaluate the relationship between serum D-dimer levels and tomography findings at the time of admission in patients diagnosed with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). This study included 94 patients, 48 women (51%) and 46 men (49%), diagnosed by PCR method. Patients without any suspicious findings on thorax tomography and having oxygen saturation above 90% at the time of presentation were included as the first group. Patients with suspicious tomography findings but having oxygen saturation above 90% were designed as the second group, and patients with both suspicious tomography findings for COVID-19 and low oxygen saturation levels (<90%) at the time of admission were taken as the third group. Patients with oxygen desaturation were significantly older than the patients with normal oxygen saturations (P = 0.001). Patients with thorax tomography findings were having significantly higher D-dimer levels (P = 0.001). Patients with oxygen desaturation were having significantly higher D-dimer levels than the patients with normal oxygen saturations (P = 0.001). There was a significant negative correlation between oxygen saturation and D-dimer levels in all patients with and without tomography findings (r = -0.301, P = 0.016). Similarly, there was a significant positive correlation between the oxygen saturation and the lymphocyte count (r = 0.300, P < 0.017). Thorax tomography and D-dimer levels significantly correlate in patients with suspected COVID-19 admission. It should be kept in mind that patients with low oxygen saturation and high D-dimer levels may have serious lung involvement.","Yalçin, Kadir S; Kasapoğlu, Benan; Alanli, Recep; Küçükay, Murat B; Koşar, Ali",Blood coagulation & fibrinolysis : an international journal in haemostasis and thrombosis,https://doi.org/10.1097/mbc.0000000000000964; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33181759/,344

However, it remains unclear which individuals are most susceptible. Electrocortical markers of reward processing, such as the reward positivity (RewP), are implicated in depression risk and may provide insights into who is most vulnerable to stress during the COVID-19 pandemic. The current study examined whether pre-pandemic neural correlates of reward reactivity (i.e., RewP) moderated the impact of social and financial stress on changes in youth and mother depression symptoms pre-to-post pandemic onset. Youth (n = 45) and mothers (n = 45) in the current sample were recruited prior to the COVID-19 pandemic as part of a larger study. RewP was assessed pre-pandemic, and depression symptoms were assessed pre- and post-pandemic onset for both youth and mothers. Additionally, social and financial chronic stress severity was assessed post-pandemic onset using a modified version of the UCLA Life Stress Interview. Financial stress was associated with prospective increases in depression for youth exhibiting blunted RewP at baseline. Similarly, family stress was associated with prospective increases in depression symptoms for mothers exhibiting blunted RewP at baseline. Findings suggest reduced reward responsiveness at the neural level may predispose both youth and mothers to future depression symptoms when exposed to higher levels of stress in the context of a pandemic.","Feurer, Cope; Granros, Maria; Calentino, Alison E; Suor, Jennifer H; Patel, Khushboo; Burkhouse, Katie L",Journal of psychiatric research,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpsychires.2021.05.034; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34111702/,344

HAdV4 and HAdV7 vaccines reduced the ARD risk in U.S. military. It is important to identify other respiratory pathogens and assess their potential impact on military readiness. In 2002, during a period when the HAdV vaccines were not available, throat swabs were taken from trainees (n = 184) with respiratory infections at Fort Jackson, South Carolina. Viral etiology was investigated initially with viral culture and neutralization assay and recently in this study by sequencing the viral isolates. Viral culture and neutralization assays identified 90 HAdV4 isolates and 27 additional cultures that showed viral cytopathic effects (CPE), including some with picornavirus-like CPE. Next-generation sequencing confirmed these results and determined viral genotypes, including 77 HAdV4, 4 HAdV3, 1 HAdV2, 17 coxsackievirus A21 (CAV21), and 1 enterovirus D68.

In the absence of new targeted drugs and vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 at present, the choices for effective treatments are limited. Therefore, considering the exigency of the situation, we focused on identifying the available approved drugs as potential inhibitor against the promising Coronavirus drug target, the Main Protease, using computer-aided methods. We created a library of U. S. Food and Drug Administration approved anti-microbial drugs and virtually screened it against the available crystal structures of Main Protease of the virus. The study revealed that Viomycin showed the highest -CDocker energy after docking at the active site of SARS-CoV-2 Main Protease. It is noteworthy that Viomycin showed higher -CDocker energy as compared to the drugs currently under clinical trial for SARS-CoV-2 treatment viz. Ritonavir and Lopinavir. Additionally, Viomycin formed higher number of H-bonds with SARS-CoV-2 Main Protease than its co-crystallised inhibitor compound N3. Molecular dynamics simulation further showed that Viomycin embedded deeply inside the binding pocket and formed robust binding with SARS-CoV-2 Main Protease. Therefore, we propose that Viomycin may act as a potential inhibitor of the Main Protease of SARS-CoV-2.

98809,What the data say about border closures and COVID spread.,2020-12-22,"OBJECTIVE To report 3 patients infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) who developed generalized myoclonus. METHODS Patient data were obtained from medical records from the University Hospital ""12 de Octubre,"" Madrid, Spain. RESULTS Three patients (2 men, and one woman, aged 63-88) presented with mild hypersomnia and generalized myoclonus following the onset of the so-called ""inflammatory"" phase of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). All of them had presented previously with anosmia. Myoclonus had a stereotypical pattern, being both positive and negative, generalized, with a predominant involvement of nasopharyngeal, facial, and upper limbs areas. These jerky movements occurred spontaneously and were extremely sensitive to multisensory stimuli (auditive and tactile) or voluntary movement, with an exaggerated startle response. Other causes of myoclonus were ruled-out, and none of them had undergone respiratory arrest or significant prolonged hypoxia. All of them improved, at least partially, with immunotherapy. CONCLUSIONS Our 3 cases highlight the occurrence of myoclonus during the COVID-19 pandemic as a postinfectious/immune-mediated disorder. However, we cannot rule out that SARS-CoV-2 may spread transneuronally to first- and second-order structures connected with the olfactory bulb. Further investigation is required to clarify the full clinical spectrum of neurologic symptoms and its optimal treatment.","Rábano-Suárez, Pablo; Bermejo-Guerrero, Laura; Méndez-Guerrero, Antonio; Parra-Serrano, Javier; Toledo-Alfocea, Daniel; Sánchez-Tejerina, Daniel; Santos-Fernández, Teresa; Folgueira-López, María Dolores; Gutiérrez-Gutiérrez, Judit; Ayuso-García, Blanca; González de la Aleja, Jesús; Benito-León, Julián",Neurology,https://doi.org/10.1212/wnl.0000000000009829; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32439821/,344

We retrospectively reviewed the medical charts of patients diagnosed with Moraxella spp. keratitis at the Quinze-Vingts National Ophthalmology Hospital, Paris, France, between January 2016 and December 2018. Definitive microbiological identification was performed on archival strains using matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time of flight coupled to mass spectrometry. One hundred one culture-proven cases of Moraxella keratitis were identified. The most common isolates were Moraxella lacunata (50%) and Moraxella nonliquefasciens (38%). Systemic predisposing factors, principally diabetes mellitus (13%) were identified in 28% of patients, and 87% of patients had ocular surface conditions, including blepharitis (25%), prior ocular surgery (21%), glaucoma (17%), exposure keratopathy (16%), and trauma (16%). Severely affected inpatients were treated empirically with fortified antibiotics including vancomycin, piperacillin, and gentamicin. The presence of hypopyon and being over the age of 60 years were associated with a poorer final visual acuity (p < 0.05). Adjuvant treatment, mostly amniotic membrane transplantation, was required for 31 eyes. The prognostic factors significantly associated with the need for adjuvant treatment were a larger infiltrate and hypoesthesia. The clinical features including ulcer healing, treatment duration, and infiltrate size were not different between Moraxella species. Keratitis caused by Moraxella spp. are rare in France but may threaten sight. The early identification of patients with a poor ocular surface, particularly those with neurotrophic keratopathy and anesthetic cornea, is crucial to prevent delayed healing of ulcers and the need for adjuvant treatment.","Hoarau, Gautier; Merabet, Lilia; Brignole-Baudouin, Françoise; Mizrahi, Assaf; Borderie, Vincent; Bouheraoua, Nacim",European journal of clinical microbiology & infectious diseases : official publication of the European Society of Clinical Microbiology,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10096-020-03985-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32648113/,344

Patterns of dispersal are influenced by both ocean currents and larval behavior, yet the role of behavior remains poorly understood. Here we report the first integrated study of the ontogeny of multiple sensory systems and orientation behavior throughout the larval phase of a coral reef fish-the neon goby, Elacatinus lori. We document the developmental morphology of all major sensory organs (lateral line, visual, auditory, olfactory, gustatory) together with the development of larval swimming and orientation behaviors observed in a circular arena set adrift at sea. We show that all sensory organs are present at hatch and increase in size (or number) and complexity throughout the larval phase. Further, we demonstrate that most larvae can orient as early as 2 days post-hatch, and they swim faster and straighter as they develop. We conclude that sensory organs and swimming abilities are sufficiently developed to allow E. lori larvae to orient soon after hatch, suggesting that early orientation behavior may be common among coral reef fishes. Finally, we provide a framework for testing alternative hypotheses for the orientation strategies used by fish larvae, laying a foundation for a deeper understanding of the role of behavior in shaping dispersal patterns in the sea.","Majoris, John E; Foretich, Matthew A; Hu, Yinan; Nickles, Katie R; Di Persia, Camilla L; Chaput, Romain; Schlatter, E; Webb, Jacqueline F; Paris, Claire B; Buston, Peter M",Scientific reports,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-91640-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34117298/,344

METHODS We undertook a systematic search of multiple databases for studies that ascertained an association between serum lipids and suicidality in adult patients with schizophrenia spectrum disorders (18-65 years) from database inception to 2nd September 2020. Qualitative analysis was done using National Institute of Health (NIH) scales. The Standard Mean Difference (SMD) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated for each study and standardized relative to the study. Adjusted p-value, Z-test, and heterogeneity were calculated, as well as testing for publication bias. RESULTS Of 1262 records identified, 17 studies (n= 3113) were included in our systematic review, while 11 studies were included in the meta-analysis. The majority of studies (11) rated fair on qualitative analysis. Data from seven studies (n= 1597) revealed a medium effect size for an association between low total cholesterol and suicide attempts (SMD -0.560; 95% CI - 0.949 - 0.170; p =0.005). People with history of suicide attempt had a mean cholesterol value 0.56 SD lower than the mean in those without suicide attempts. There were differences in how a suicide attempt was defined and there was high heterogeneity (I2 = 83.3%). No significant association was found between any of the serum lipid parameters and suicide ideation. Funnel-plot analysis suggested small study effects with publication bias. CONCLUSIONS Suicide attempts in people with schizophrenia spectrum disorders is associated with low mean total cholesterol levels.","Sankaranarayanan, Anoop; Pratt, Robin; Anoop, Aparna; Smith, Angela; Espinoza, David; Ramachandran, Padmavati; Tirupati, Srinivasan",Acta psychiatrica Scandinavica,https://doi.org/10.1111/acps.13305; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33834474/,344

The screening of titles and abstracts is the most time consuming part of the review process with analysts required review thousands of articles manually, taking on average 33 days. New technologies aimed at streamlining the screening process have provided initial promising findings, yet there are limitations with current approaches and barriers to the widespread use of these tools. In this paper, we introduce and report initial evidence on the utility of Research Screener, a semi-automated machine learning tool to facilitate abstract screening. METHODS Three sets of analyses (simulation, interactive and sensitivity) were conducted to provide evidence of the utility of the tool through both simulated and real-world examples. RESULTS Research Screener delivered a workload saving of between 60 and 96% across nine systematic reviews and two scoping reviews. Findings from the real-world interactive analysis demonstrated a time saving of 12.53 days compared to the manual screening, which equates to a financial saving of USD 2444. Conservatively, our results suggest that analysts who scan 50% of the total pool of articles identified via a systematic search are highly likely to have identified 100% of eligible papers. CONCLUSIONS In light of these findings, Research Screener is able to reduce the burden for researchers wishing to conduct a comprehensive systematic review without reducing the scientific rigour for which they strive to achieve.","Chai, Kevin E K; Lines, Robin L J; Gucciardi, Daniel F; Ng, Leo",Systematic reviews,https://doi.org/10.1186/s13643-021-01635-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33795003/,344

This task is more complex for glycopeptides and is crucial for the confident determination of glycosylation sites in glycoproteins. MS_Piano (Mass Spectrum Peptide Annotation) software was developed for reliable annotation of peaks in collision induced dissociation (CID) tandem mass spectra of peptides or N-glycopeptides for given peptide sequences, charge states, and optional modifications. The program annotates each peak in high or low resolution spectra with possible product ion(s) and the mass difference between the measured and theoretical m/z values. Spectral quality is measured by two major parameters: the ratio between the sum of unannotated vs all peak intensities in the top 20 peaks, and the intensity of the highest unannotated peak. The product ions of peptides, glycans, and glycopeptides in spectra are labeled in different class-type colors to facilitate interpretation. MS_Piano assists validating peptide and N-glycopeptide identification from database and library searches and provides quality control and optimizes search reliability in custom developed peptide mass spectral libraries.

CFB fly ash-blast furnace slag (BFS)-based cemented backfill materials with unequal strength grades are used in different locations of the goaf that require more than 1 Mpa and 4 Mpa, respectively, and the leaching levels of all toxic components are lower than the underground III water quality standard limit when the additional amount of CFB fly ash does not exceed 60 wt.%.

Many of these vaccines are based on strategies to induce protective antibody responses against the surface glycoproteins of antigenically and genetically diverse influenza viruses. These strategies might also be applicable to surface glycoproteins of a broad range of other important viral pathogens. Areas covered: Common strategies include sequential vaccination with divergent antigens, multivalent approaches, vaccination with glycan-modified antigens, vaccination with minimal antigens and vaccination with antigens that have centralized/optimized sequences. Here we review these strategies and the underlying concepts. Furthermore, challenges, feasibility and applicability to other viral pathogens are discussed. Expert commentary: Several broadly protective/universal influenza virus vaccine strategies will be tested in humans in the coming years. If successful in terms of safety and immunological readouts, they will move forward into efficacy trials.

105298,Will online symptom checkers improve health care in Australia?,2020-05-21,"UNLABELLED The need for proper healthcare waste management has been a crucial issue in many developing countries as it is in Turkey. The regulation regarding healthcare wastes in Turkey was updated in 2005 in accordance with the European Union (EU) waste directives, but it still falls behind meeting the requirements of current waste treatment technologies. Therefore, this study aims to reveal deficiencies, inconsistencies, and improper applications of healthcare waste management in the western part of the Turkish Black Sea Region. In this study, it was revealed that nearly 1 million people live in the region, resulting in 5 million hospital admissions annually. All the healthcare waste produced (1000 tons yr(-1)) is treated in an autoclave plant. However, treating some categories of healthcare wastes in autoclave units mismatches with the EU waste regulations, as alternative treatment technologies are not technically able to treat all types of healthcare wastes. A proper waste management system, therefore, requires an internal segregation scheme to divert these wastes from the main healthcare waste stream. The existing malpractice in the region could cause serious health problems if no measure is taken urgently. It is expected that healthcare waste management in the region and then all across Turkey will be improved with the significant deficiencies and inconsistencies pointed out in this research. IMPLICATIONS In developed countries, specific rules and regulations have already been implemented along with the recommendations for handling of healthcare waste. However, in Turkey, these wastes are treated in autoclave units, which mismatches with the European Union waste regulations, as alternative treatment technologies are not technically capable to treat all types of healthcare wastes. The existing malpractice could cause serious health problems if no measure is taken urgently. The authors demonstrated the existing status of Turkish waste management and revealed deficiencies, inconsistencies, and improper applications in comparison with developed and developing nations to align Turkish practice to European Union requirements.","Ciplak, Nesli; Kaskun, Songul",Journal of the Air & Waste Management Association,https://doi.org/10.1080/10962247.2015.1076539; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26223409/,344

METHOD The sample of the descriptive, cross-sectional and correlational study consisted of healthcare professionals working in two university hospitals in western Turkey between May and July 2021. We used the ""Personal Information Form, Coronavirus Anxiety Scale, and Working Life Quality Scale"" as data collection tools. We used numbers and percentage calculations, arithmetic mean, median (25th-75th percentile), Mann Whitney U test, Spearmen correlation analysis, and Linear Regression analysis to analyze the data. RESULTS The mean score on the Quality of Life Scale of healthcare professionals was 3.74±0.28, and the mean score on the Coronavirus Anxiety Scale was 9.66±6.06 (min.0; max.20). We found a negative and weakly significant relationship between the mean score of the coronavirus anxiety scale of healthcare professionals and the mean score of the employee quality of life scale. According to the results of the multiple linear regression analysis, we found the factors significantly affecting the anxiety states of healthcare professionals related to the Coronavirus are the quality of working life, age, sex, and the state of caring for a patient with COVID-19. CONCLUSION As a conclusion of this study, it was determined that healthcare professionals experienced anxiety, and anxiety decreased as ages, working years, and the number of children they have increased. In addition, it was determined that as the anxiety of healthcare professionals increased, the quality of working life decreased.","Aydın, Aykut; Kulakaç, Nurşen; Aydın Sayılan, Aylin",International journal of clinical practice,https://doi.org/10.1111/ijcp.14889; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34541747/,344

METHODS Consecutive patients undergoing abdominosacral resection between January 2006 and December 2011 were identified from a prospectively maintained database. The main endpoints were 3-year local recurrence-free (LRFS) and disease-free (DFS) survival. RESULTS Thirty patients underwent abdominosacral resection, 22 for recurrent rectal cancer and eight for locally advanced primary cancer. Sacrectomy was performed at S1/2 in five, S3 in 11 and S4/5 in 14 patients. R0 resection was achieved in 23 patients; all seven positive margins (R1) were in patients with recurrent disease. There were no deaths in hospital or within 30 days. S1/2 sacrectomy was associated with the highest rate of major complications (60 per cent versus 27 and 29 per cent for S3 and S4/5 respectively) and long-term complications (60, 36 and 14 per cent). Overall 3-year LRFS was 66 per cent and 3-year DFS was 55 per cent. Both were significantly better in patients with negative compared with positive margins (LRFS: 87 versus 0 per cent, P < 0.001; DFS: 71 versus 0 per cent, P = 0.033). CONCLUSION Abdominosacral resection was associated with long-term survival in carefully selected patients with advanced rectal cancer. Postoperative complications were common and often multiple. Sacrectomy for locally advanced primary rectal cancer was associated with a low margin-positive rate and should be considered as an acceptable treatment. Margin-positive resection was associated with poor survival outcomes and should be avoided.","Bhangu, A; Brown, G; Akmal, M; Tekkis, P",The British journal of surgery,https://doi.org/10.1002/bjs.8881; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22961529/,344

The goal of the FLS program is to teach and assess the basic cognitive and psychomotor skills required to perform laparoscopic surgery. The purpose of this study is to review the results from the first 5 years of FLS certification testing. METHODS FLS test data were prospectively collected for all participants taking the FLS certification examination since its inception. Deidentified data were reviewed and analyzed using standard descriptive statistics. RESULTS The FLS examination was taken by 2,689 participants between October 2004 and December 2009. There was a yearly increase in the number of individuals seeking FLS certification. Complete demographic information was available for 1,882 participants: 12% were junior residents (PGY 1-3), 69% were senior residents (PGY 4-5) or fellows, and 19% were attending surgeons. A breakdown of participants by specialty revealed that 88% were general surgeons, 4% were gynecologists, 2% were urologists, and 6% were labeled as ""other."" The mean (standard deviation, SD) score on the cognitive examination was 519 (157), with a 93% pass rate. The mean score on the technical skills examination was 525 (117), with a 92% pass rate. After combining both scores, the overall FLS certification pass rate was 88%. CONCLUSIONS The FLS certification examination has gained widespread acceptance among laparoscopic surgeons in training and practice, with a marked increase in testing since the American Board of Surgery mandate for certification was announced. The overall pass rate of 88% on the examination approaches the target pass rate of 90% established during the test-setting process.","Okrainec, Allan; Soper, Nathaniel J; Swanstrom, Lee L; Fried, Gerald M",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-010-1343-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20872021/,344

The aim was to address this deficit through basic research. Since cerebral and systemic physiological parameters are likely to interact, it was necessary to establish an approach, which we have termed ""systemic-physiology-augmented functional near-infrared spectroscopy (SPA-fNIRS) neuroimaging."" This multimodal approach measures the systemic and cerebral physiological response to exposure to light of different colors. In 14 healthy subjects (9 men, 5 women, age: [Formula: see text] years, range: 24 to 57 years) exposed to red, green, and blue light (10-min intermittent wide-field visual color stimulation; [Formula: see text] blocks of visual stimulation), brain hemodynamics and oxygenation were measured by fNIRS on the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and visual cortex (VC) simultaneously, in addition with systemic parameters. This study demonstrated that (i) all colors elicited responses in the VC, whereas only blue evoked a response in the PFC; (ii) there was a color-dependent effect on cardiorespiratory activity; (iii) there was significant change in neurosystemic functional connectivity; (iv) cerebral hemodynamic responses in the PFC and changes in the cardiovascular system were gender and age dependent; and (v) electrodermal activity and psychological state showed no stimulus-evoked changes, and there was no dependence on color of light, age, and gender. We showed that short-term light exposure caused color-dependent responses in cerebral hemodynamics/oxygenation as well as cardiorespiratory dynamics. Additionally, we showed that neurosystemic functional connectivity changes even during apparently stress-free tasks-an important consideration when using any of the hemodynamic neuroimaging methods (e.g. functional magnetic resonance imaging, positron emission tomography, and fNIRS).

The so-called and recently introduced term 'acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections' (ABSSSIs), a cluster of fairly common types of infection, including abscesses, cellulitis, and wound infections, require an immediate effective antibacterial treatment as part of a timely and cautious management. The extreme level of resistance globally to many antibiotic drugs in the prevalent causative pathogens, the presence of risk factors of treatment failure, and the high epidemic of comorbidities (e.g. diabetes and obesity) make the appropriate selection of the antibiotic for physicians highly challenging. The selection of antibiotics is primarily empirical for ABSSSI patients which subsequently can be adjusted based on culture results, although rarely available in outpatient management. There is substantial evidence suggesting that inappropriate antibiotic treatment is given to approximately 20-25% of patients, potentially prolonging their hospital stay and increasing the risk of morbidity and mortality. The current review paper discusses the concerns related to the management of ABSSSI and the patient types who are most vulnerable to poor outcomes. It also highlights the key management time-points that treating physicians and surgeons must be aware of in order to achieve clinical success and to discharge patients from the hospital as early as possible.","Pulido-Cejudo, Abraham; Guzmán-Gutierrez, Mario; Jalife-Montaño, Abel; Ortiz-Covarrubias, Alejandro; Martínez-Ordaz, Jose Luis; Noyola-Villalobos, Héctor Faustino; Hurtado-López, Luis Mauricio",Therapeutic advances in infectious disease,https://doi.org/10.1177/2049936117723228; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28959445/,344
110384,Leadership: virtual special issue.,2020-12-10,"OBJECTIVE To explore the CT imaging features/signs of patients with different clinical types of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) via the application of artificial intelligence (AI), thus improving the understanding of COVID-19. PANTIENTS AND METHODS Clinical data and chest CT imaging features of 58 patients confirmed with COVID-19 in the Fifth Medical Center of PLA General Hospital were retrospectively analyzed. According to the Guidelines on Novel Coronavirus-Infected Pneumonia Diagnosis and Treatment (Provisional 6th Edition), COVID-19 patients were divided into mild type (7), common type (34), severe type (7) and critical type (10 patients). The CT imaging features of the patients with different clinical types of COVID-19 types were analyzed, and the volume percentage of pneumonia lesions with respect to the lung lobes (where the lesion was located) and to the whole lung was calculated with the use of AI software. SPSS 21.0 software was used for statistical analysis. RESULTS Common clinical manifestations of COVID-19 patients: fever was found in 47 patients (81.0%), cough in 31 (53.4%) and weakness in 10 (17.2%). Laboratory examinations: normal or decreased white blood cell (WBC) counts were observed in 52 patients (89.7%), decreased lymphocyte counts (LCs) in 14 (24.1%) and increased C-reactive protein (CRP) levels in 18 (31.0%). CT imaging features: there were 48 patients (94.1%) with lesions distributed in both lungs and 46 patients (90.2%) had lesions most visible in the lower lungs; the primary manifestations in patients with common type COVID-19 were ground-glass opacities (GGOs) (23/34, 67.6%) or mixed type (17/34, 50.0%), with lesions mainly distributed in the periphery of the lungs (28/34, 82.4%); the primary manifestations of patients with severe/critical type COVID-19 were consolidations (13/17, 76.5%) or mixed type (14/17, 82.4%), with lesions distributed in both the peripheral and central areas of lungs (14/17,82.4%); other common signs, including pleural parallel signs, halo signs, vascular thickening signs, crazy-paving signs and air bronchogram signs, were visible in patients with different clinical types, and pleural effusion was found in 5 patients with severe/critical COVID-19. AI software was used to calculate the volume percentages of pneumonia lesions with respect to the lung lobes (where the lesion was located) and to the whole lung. There were significant differences in the volume percentages of pneumonia lesions for the superior lobe of the left lung, the inferior lobe of the left lung, the superior lobe of the right lung, the inferior lobe of the right lung and the whole lung among patients with different clinical types (p<0.05). The area under the ROC curve (AUC) of the volume percentage of pneumonia lesions for the whole lung for the diagnosis of severe/critical type COVID-19 was 0.740, with sensitivity and specificity of 91.2% and 58.8%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS The clinical and CT imaging features of COVID-19 patients were characteristic to a certain degree; thus, the clinical course and severity of COVID-19 could be evaluated with a combination of an analysis of clinical features and CT imaging features and assistant diagnosis by AI software.","Ren, H-W; Wu, Y; Dong, J-H; An, W-M; Yan, T; Liu, Y; Liu, C-C",European review for medical and pharmacological sciences,https://doi.org/10.26355/eurrev_202008_22510; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32767351/,344
110821,It is irrational to exclude vets from Covid-19 control.,2020-05-30,"Fabrication of heterostructures by merging two or more materials in a single object. The domains at the nanoscale represent a viable strategy to purposely address materials' properties for applications in several fields such as catalysis, biomedicine, and energy conversion. In this case, solution-phase seeded growth and the hot-injection method are ingeniously combined to fabricate TiO2/PbS heterostructures. The interest in such hybrid nanostructures arises from their absorption properties that make them advantageous candidates as solar cell materials for more efficient solar light harvesting and improved light conversion. Due to the strong lattice mismatch between TiO2 and PbS, the yield of the hybrid structure and the control over its properties are challenging. In this study, a systematic investigation of the heterostructure synthesis as a function of the experimental conditions (such as seeds' surface chemistry, reaction temperature, and precursor concentration), its topology, structural properties, and optical properties are carried out. The morphological and chemical characterizations confirm the formation of small dots of PbS by decorating the oleylamine surface capped TiO2 nanocrystals under temperature control. Remarkably, structural characterization points out that the formation of heterostructures is accompanied by modification of the crystallinity of the TiO2 domain, which is mainly ascribed to lattice distortion. This result is also confirmed by photoluminescence spectroscopy, which shows intense emission in the visible range. This originated from self-trapped excitons, defects, and trap emissive states.","Dibenedetto, Carlo Nazareno; Sibillano, Teresa; Brescia, Rosaria; Prato, Mirko; Triggiani, Leonardo; Giannini, Cinzia; Panniello, Annamaria; Corricelli, Michela; Comparelli, Roberto; Ingrosso, Chiara; Depalo, Nicoletta; Agostiano, Angela; Curri, Maria Lucia; Striccoli, Marinella; Fanizza, Elisabetta",Molecules,https://doi.org/10.3390/molecules25122939; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32604749/,344

DESIGN Prospective observational pilot study. SETTING Academic medical center. PARTICIPANTS Patient-derived clinical-grade culture expanded AMSCs. INTERVENTIONS AMSCs were passed through syringes without a needle attached (control), with an 18-gauge (25.4-mm) needle attached and with a 30-gauge (19-mm) needle attached at a constant injection flow rate and constant cell concentrations. Each injection condition was completed in triplicate. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Cell number and viability, proliferative capacity, metabolic activity, and acute gene expression as measured by cell counts, mitochondrial activity, and quantitative real time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction on day 0 (immediately), day 1, and day 4 after injection. RESULTS AMSC viability was not significantly affected by injection, and cells proliferated normally regardless of study group. Postinjection, AMSCs robustly expressed both proliferation markers and extracellular matrix proteins. Stress-response mRNAs were markedly but transiently increased independently of needle size within the first day in culture postinjection. CONCLUSIONS Human, culture-expanded AMSCs maintain their viability, proliferative capacity, and metabolic function following passage through needles as small as 30-gauge at constant flow rates of 4 mL/min, despite an early, nonspecific stress/cytoprotective response. These initial findings suggest that culture-expanded AMSCs should tolerate the injection process during most cell-based therapeutic interventions.","Onishi, Kentaro; Jones, Dakota L; Riester, Scott M; Lewallen, Eric A; Lewallen, David G; Sellon, Jacob L; Dietz, Allan B; Qu, Wenchun; van Wijnen, Andre J; Smith, Jay","PM & R : the journal of injury, function, and rehabilitation",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pmrj.2016.01.010; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26826615/,344
112386,Safety Considerations for In Situ Simulation in Closed SARS-CoV-2 Units.,2020-12-02,"PURPOSE With the rising incidence of failed bariatric procedures, the importance of revisional surgery has been increasing. These revisional procedures come with a higher risk of complications leading to longer hospital stays. We believe though that enhanced recovery after revisional bariatric surgery is possible and needs to be advocated. MATERIALS AND METHODS We retrospectively analyzed our laparoscopic conversions of failed gastric banding and failed Mason gastroplasty to Roux-en-Y gastric bypass. A total of 321 patients was included in the study, from February 2010 until December 2019. The primary endpoints were length of stay (LoS), in-hospital complication rate, and early readmission rate (< 30 days). Logistic regression was used to investigate the impact of several independent variables on complication and readmission rates. RESULTS Fifty-four patients were male and 267 female. The mean age was 44.2 years and mean BMI at the time of conversion was 37.9 kg/m2. We converted 273 failed adjustable gastric bandings (85,0%) and 48 failed Mason gastroplasties (15.0%). The main reason for conversion was the recurrence of obesity. A mean LoS of 2.10 days was calculated. We had an overall in-hospital complication rate of 3.73% and the overall early readmission rate was 3.43%. The odds ratio for LoS on early readmission is 1.52 (p=0.0079; CI 95% [1.12-2.07]). CONCLUSION The above data imply that the implementation of advanced ERAS principles for revisional surgery in our center is safe and does not lead to a higher risk of early readmission.","Ruyssers, Michael; Gys, Ben; Jawad, Rami; Mergeay, Matthias; Janssen, Luc; Van Houtert, Cathy; Gys, Tobie; Lafullarde, Thierry",Obesity surgery,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11695-021-05235-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33559818/,344
112760,How to demystify COVID-19 and reduce social stigma.,2020-06-01,"ABSTRACT The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has required swift implementation of innovative practices in health care across the globe. We describe a nurse practitioner (NP) and physician assistant (PA)-led initiative to implement telemonitoring (TM) of noncritical patients with COVID-19 by critical care NPs and PAs (C19TM) for early detection of decompensation and early transfer to the intensive care unit (ICU). Every hospitalized patient with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 received an initial telemedicine consult with a critical care NP or PA. Patients were subsequently monitored via electronic health record once every 12-hour shift for the following indicators: oxygen modality and flow, increase in oxygen requirements, sustained tachypnea, and hemodynamic instability. If signs of decompensation were noted, the NP/PA would remotely reassess the patient, provide recommendations to the hospital internal medicine team, and transfer the patient to the ICU. The primary goal was to avoid cardiopulmonary deterioration requiring aerosol-generating procedures outside of the ICU. Over 65 days, 113 patients (86 suspected and 27 confirmed) were enrolled in C19TM. As a result, there were 13 transfers to the ICU, none of which required an aerosol-generating procedure outside of the ICU.","Santos, Christan D; Grek, Ami A; Ojard, Michelle M; Propst, Joshua A; Hastings, Jacquelyn J; Krider, Tina L; Villar, Dolores C; Sanghavi, Devang K; Freeman, William D; Siegel, Jason L",Journal of the American Association of Nurse Practitioners,https://doi.org/10.1097/jxx.0000000000000558; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33560753/,344

The ability of countries to contain and mitigate interventions is crucial in controlling the exponential spread of the novel virus. Several social distancing and control measurements have been applied in Saudi Arabia to mitigate COVID-19 epidemic such as quarantine, schools closure, suspending travels, reducing crowds, people movement restrictions, self-isolation and contacts tracing. This research aims to study the country interventions in Saudi Arabia and their impact on decreasing the spread of COVID-19. This paper examined different control measurements scenarios produced by a modified SEIR mathematical model with an emphasis on testing capacity expansion and number of critical cases. The modified SEIR mathematical model is solved numerically using Rung-Kutta analysis method for solving the modified SEIR system of ordinary differential equations. The simulation results revealed that the interventions are vital to flatten the virus spread curve. Early implementation of country interventions can delay the peak and decrease the population fatality rate.","Yousif, Adil; Ali, Awad",Mathematical biosciences and engineering : MBE,https://doi.org/10.3934/mbe.2020412; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33378936/,344

This study compared plain polypropylene mesh with a pectin-honey hydrogel-coated polypropylene mesh in an acute hernia model in rats. Forty Wistar rats, randomly assigned to two groups, were submitted to laparotomy, and a 1 cm × 2 cm fascial defect was created, centered on the midline. Uncoated (group C) or coated mesh (group T) was inserted in an inlay fashion to repair the defect. After 30 days, the rats were euthanized, and the presence of adhesions to the mesh was macroscopically evaluated. Histology and measurement of COX-2 as tissue inflammation markers were used to assess fascia tissue healing. Grades of adhesion were not different between groups. Histological score and COX-2 expression were not significantly different between groups, except for the higher inflammatory response demonstrated in group T. The pectin-hydrogel coated mesh could not reduce adhesion formation compared to uncoated polypropylene mesh but improved peritoneal regeneration and tissue healing.","Vercelli, Cristina; Re, Giovanni; Iussich, Selina; Odore, Rosangela; Morello, Emanuela Maria; Gandini, Marco; Giusto, Gessica",Gels,https://doi.org/10.3390/gels7030132; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34563018/,344

However, a limited number of studies have examined outcomes and complications specific to embolization of anterior communicating artery aneurysms. MATERIALS AND METHODS A systematic review of the literature was conducted with the use of multiple data bases to identify reports on endovascular treatment of anterior communicating artery aneurysms between 1994 and 2012. Angiographic results, clinical outcomes, and complication rates were pooled across studies by using random-effects meta-analysis with subgroup analysis of outcomes by rupture status and time trend stratification. RESULTS Fourteen studies, consisting of 1552 treated anterior communicating artery aneurysms, were included in this meta-analysis. The rate of immediate and long-term complete and near-complete angiographic occlusion was 88% (95% CI = 81-93%) and 85% (95% CI = 78-90%), respectively. Intraprocedural rupture rate was 4% (95% CI = 3-6%). The re-bleeding rate was 2% (95% CI = 1-4%) and the retreatment rate was 7% (95% CI = 5-12%). Morbidity or mortality caused by perioperative stroke occurred at a 3% (95% CI = 2-6%) rate. Overall procedure-related morbidity and mortality were 6% (95% CI = 4-8%) and 3% (95% CI = 2-4%), respectively. Outcomes did not differ between ruptured and unruptured aneurysms, nor did outcomes change over time, though these latter subanalyses were relatively underpowered. CONCLUSIONS Endovascular therapy for anterior communicating artery aneurysms is associated with a high rate of complete angiographic occlusion. However, the procedure-related permanent morbidity and mortality are not negligible for aneurysms in this location.","Fang, S; Brinjikji, W; Murad, M H; Kallmes, D F; Cloft, H J; Lanzino, G",AJNR.

Clinical and imaging files of consecutive patients with ICA occlusion who were treated in a tertiary care academic medical center from 2011-2015 were retrospectively examined under Institutional Review Board approval with a waiver of the requirement for informed consent. All proximal ICA occlusions were treated by stent-assisted carotid angioplasty, and all distal embolic occlusions were managed with stent-assisted mechanical thrombectomy. The study included 24 patients with acute ICA occlusion (group 1) and 30 patients with tandem ICA-intracranial occlusions (group 2). The spike sign was seen in 16/24 patients in group 1 (67%), and successful ICA revascularization was achieved in 14/16 (88%). The sign was seen in 26/30 patients in group 2 (87%), and ICA revascularization was successful in all 26 (100%). The remaining 12 patients had no spike sign, and ICA revascularization was successful in only 7/12 (58%). The spike sign is a transient finding that represents the proximal patent remnant of the stenotic corridor in fresh clot. Acute ICA occlusion frequently leaves the spike sign as a marker of the recent thrombotic event. The spike vertex points to the ""path of least resistance"" for the guidewire to cross the occlusion and engage the true arterial lumen, a critical step during ICA endovascular revascularization.","Cohen, José E; Gomori, John M; Leker, Ronen R; Eichel, Roni; Itshayek, Eyal",Journal of clinical neuroscience : official journal of the Neurosurgical Society of Australasia,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jocn.2015.12.013; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26935747/,344

STUDY DESIGN Case series with chart review. SETTING Tertiary academic referral center. PATIENTS Fifty-three consecutive cases using a resorbable mesh cranioplasty after translabyrinthine tumor resection were reviewed. INTERVENTION Temporal bone defects were repaired with a dural substitute, layered fat graft, and a resorbable mesh plate secured with screws. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Primary outcome measures included the incidence of postoperative CSF wound leak or rhinorrhea, pseudomeningocele formation, and surgical site infection. RESULTS Fifty-three cases (average age, 54.0 yr; range, 19.3-75.1 yr) were analyzed. The average body mass index was 30.8 kg/m2 (range, 17.9-48.3 kg/m2), and the average tumor size was 18.8 mm (range, 8-38 mm). One patient (1.9%) experienced CSF rhinorrhea on postoperative Day 16, which resolved after transmastoid middle ear and eustachian tube packing. One patient (1.9%) experienced a surgical site infection requiring surgical debridement and mesh removal 4 months after surgery. Compared with 1,441 prior translabyrinthine surgeries analyzed from our institution using a traditional fat graft closure without mesh, the rate of postoperative CSF leak was significantly less using the resorbable mesh cranioplasty technique (p = 0.0483).

However, some randomised controlled trials (RCT) have demonstrated that women benefited significantly less from intervention than men. It is unclear if this is a true phenomenon or a study sampling artefact, as women were severely under-represented in all RCTs of carotid revascularisation. A systematic review is needed to summarise the existing data and to answer the question of whether a women-only trial for symptomatic patients with ipsilateral carotid stenosis is scientifically necessary and ethically permissible. METHODS AND ANALYSIS We will systematically search Medline, Embase, PubMed and the Cochrane libraries for all studies with data from RCTs that included women and compared either endarterectomy with stenting or revascularisation (by means of endarterectomy or stenting) with medical therapy in patients with symptomatic carotid stenosis. Search dates will be restricted to 1991-2018. Two reviewers will conduct screening search results, study selection, data extraction and quality assessment. We will include all studies reporting outcomes of interest. Planned subgroup analysis based on revascularisation technique, degree of stenosis and timing of intervention from the index event will be conducted with enough data. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION This research is exempt of ethics approval as no primary data will be collected. The results will be published in peer-reviewed journals and disseminated through national and international-level conferences and scientific meetings. The result of this comprehensive review will provide useful information on whether further RCTs are required to study a women-only population with symptomatic carotid disease.

DESIGN Longitudinal observational study. SETTING Tertiary referral urogynecology center. POPULATION One hundred and five women with at least an anterior vaginal wall prolapse and concomitant SUI who underwent surgery. METHODS After reduction of prolapse elements, the intervention consisted of a non-absorbable monoprosthesis placement with two transobturator expansions and, if necessary, associated hysterectomy or infraccocygeal sacropexy. No specific procedure was performed for SUI. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES All patients had a physical examination and a subjective symptoms assessment via questionnaire in the preoperative period and at one-year or more after surgery. The pelvic organ prolapse quantification system was used for anatomical results. For SUI, Ingelman-Sundberg classification and cough test were used. Loss of urine was measured by a one-hour pad test. Functional results were evaluated by visual analog scale, quality-of-life questionnaires, including the pelvic floor distress inventory and the pelvic floor impact questionnaire. RESULTS Median follow-up was 45 months (range: 12-72). A total of 102 women (97%) were cured of their prolapse, of whom 72 (69%) were cured of their SUI and 13 (12%) showed improvement. Pad test, visual analogic scale and quality-of-life questionnaires were all improved (p < 0.05). Complications consisted of one rectal injury, one transitory urinary retention, and two hematomas.

124003,Advice P.R.N.,2021-03-01,"BACKGROUNDCorticosteroids are widely used in patients with COVID 19, although their benefit-to-risk ratio remains controversial.METHODSPatients with severe COVID-19-related acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) were included from December 29, 2019 to March 16, 2020 in 5 tertiary Chinese hospitals. Cox proportional hazards and competing risks analyses were conducted to analyze the impact of corticosteroids on mortality and SARS-CoV-2 RNA clearance, respectively. We performed a propensity score (PS) matching analysis to control confounding factors.RESULTSOf 774 eligible patients, 409 patients received corticosteroids, with a median time from hospitalization to starting corticosteroids of 1.0 day (IQR 0.0-3.0 days) . As compared with usual care, treatment with corticosteroids was associated with increased rate of myocardial (15.6% vs. 10.4%, P = 0.041) and liver injury (18.3% vs. 9.9%, P = 0.001), of shock (22.0% vs. 12.6%, P < 0.001), of need for mechanical ventilation (38.1% vs. 19.5%, P < 0.001), and increased rate of 28-day all-cause mortality (44.3% vs. 31.0%, P < 0.001). After PS matching, corticosteroid therapy was associated with 28-day mortality (adjusted HR 1.46, 95% CI 1.01-2.13, P = 0.045). High dose (>200 mg) and early initiation (≤3 days from hospitalization) of corticosteroid therapy were associated with a higher 28-day mortality rate. Corticosteroid use was also associated with a delay in SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus RNA clearance in the competing risk analysis (subhazard ratio 1.59, 95% CI 1.17-2.15, P = 0.003).CONCLUSIONAdministration of corticosteroids in severe COVID-19-related ARDS is associated with increased 28-day mortality and delayed SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus RNA clearance after adjustment for time-varying confounders.FUNDINGNone.","Liu, Jiao; Zhang, Sheng; Dong, Xuan; Li, Zhongyi; Xu, Qianghong; Feng, Huibin; Cai, Jing; Huang, Sisi; Guo, Jun; Zhang, Lidi; Chen, Yizhu; Zhu, Wei; Du, Hangxiang; Liu, Yongan; Wang, Tao; Chen, Limin; Wen, Zhenliang; Annane, Djillali; Qu, Jieming; Chen, Dechang",The Journal of clinical investigation,https://doi.org/10.1172/jci140617; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33141117/,344
125556,The role of virtual reality in the changing landscape of surgical training.,2020-10-09,"Background Irisin (a glycosylated protein) is cleaved from fibronectin type III domain-containing protein 5 (FNDC5), which is expressed mainly in animal muscle tissues and has multiple metabolic regulatory activities. However, their roles in controlling myofiber types in skeletal muscle remain unclear. Methodology Two different commercial hybridized pigs, LJH (a crossed pig containing Chinese native pig genotypes) and DLY (Duroc × Landrace × Yorkshire) were selected to analyze FNDC5 mRNA expression and the mRNA composition of four adult myosin heavy chain (MyHC) isoforms (IIIaIIxIIb) in the longissimus dorsi (LD) muscle. C2C12 myoblasts were cultured to investigate the effects of FNDC5 on the four MyHCs mRNA expressive levels, using small interfering RNA for depletion and a eukaryotic expression vector carrying FNDC5 for overexpression. ZLN005 (a small molecule activator of FNDC5's upstream control gene PGC1α) or recombinant human irisin protein were also used. Results In LD muscle, LJH pigs had the higher FNDC5 mRNA level, and MyHC I or IIa proportion than DLY pigs (P < 0.05). For C2C12 cells in vitro, small interfering RNA (si-592) silencing of FNDC5 expression markedly reduced MyHC IIa mRNA levels (P < 0.05), while FNDC5 overexpression significantly increased MyHC IIa mRNA levels (P < 0.05). Exogenous irisin increased the mRNA levels of PGC1α (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1-alpha), FNDC5, MyHCI, MyHCIIa, NRF1 (nuclear respiratory factor 1), VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor), and TFAM (mitochondrial transcription factor A,) (P < 0.05), and the enzyme activities of SDH (succinate dehydrogenase), CK (creatine kinase), and MDH (malate dehydrogenase) in C2C12 myotubes (P < 0.05). These results showed that FNDC5 mRNA expression had a significant association with the characteristics of myofiber types in porcine muscle, and participated in regulating MyHCs mRNA expression of C2C12 myogenic differentiation cells in vitro. FNDC5 could be an important factor to control muscle fiber types, which provides a new direction to investigate pork quality via muscle fiber characteristics.","Men, Xiao-Ming; Xu, Zi-Wei; Tao, Xin; Deng, Bo; Qi, Ke-Ke",PeerJ,https://doi.org/10.7717/peerj.11065; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33976958/,344

This so-called cytokine storm often leads to refractory edema, respiratory arrest, and death. At present, anti-IL-6, antiviral therapy, convalescent plasma, hydroxychloroquine, and azithromycin among others are being investigated as potential treatments for COVID-19. As the disease etiology and precise therapeutic interventions are still not definitively defined, we wanted to review the roles that complement and the contact system may have in either the treatment or pathogenesis of the disease. Methods We searched the recent literature (PubMed) on complement and coronavirus; contact system and coronavirus; bradykinin and coronavirus; and angiotensin receptor and coronavirus. The manuscript complies with ethics guidelines and was deemed exempt from institutional review board approval according to Human Subjects Protection Office guidelines. Results Mouse models are available for the study of coronavirus and complement. Although complement is effective in protecting against many viruses, it does not seem to be protective against coronavirus. C3 knockout mice infected with SARS-CoV had less lung disease than wild-type mice, suggesting that complement may play a role in coronavirus pathogenesis. Some evidence suggests that the observed pulmonary edema may be bradykinin-induced and could be the reason that corticosteroids, antihistamines, and other traditional interventions for edema are not effective. Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is a co-receptor for SARS-CoV-2, and studies thus far have not concluded a benefit or risk associated with the use of either ACE-inhibitors or angiotensin receptor antagonists. Summary Activation of complement and the contact system, through generation of bradykinin, may play a role in the SARS-CoV-2-induced pulmonary edema, and our search suggests that further work is necessary to confirm our suspicions.","Maglakelidze, Natella; Manto, Kristen M; Craig, Timothy J",Pulmonary therapy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s41030-020-00118-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32405531/,344

PATIENTS AND METHODS In all, 20 patients (19 male and one female) with a mean (sd; range) age of 57.2 (12.4; 31.0-78.2) years underwent robot-assisted radical cystectomy (RARC). Most cases were ≤pT1 (17 patients) and the remaining three patients had muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC) at RARC histopathology. Although half of the patients (10) actually had MIBC at transurethral resection histopathology. All patients underwent RARC, bilateral pelvic lymphadenectomy, and intracorporeal neobladder formation using a pyramid detubularised folding pouch configuration. RESULTS The median estimated blood loss was 250 mL and operating time was 5.5 h. The mean (sd) number of lymph nodes removed was 16.5 (7.8) and median hospital stay was 10 days. Early postoperative complications included urinary tract infection (UTI) (four patients), ileus (four), diarrhoea and vomiting (three), postoperative collection (two), and blocked stent (one). Late postoperative complications included UTI (seven patients), neobladder stone (two), voiding Hem-o-Loc (two), neobladder leak (two), diarrhoea and vomiting (one), uretero-ileal stricture (one), vitamin B12 deficiency (one), and port-site hernia (one). There was no evidence of hydronephrosis in 18 patients with a median follow-up of 21.5 months. At 24 months, recurrence-free survival was 86% and overall survival was 100%. In all, 19 patients and 13 patients reported 6-month day time and night time continence, respectively. CONCLUSIONS The pyramid neobladder is technically feasible using a robotic platform and provides satisfactory functional outcomes at median of 21.5 months.","Tan, Wei Shen; Sridhar, Ashwin; Goldstraw, Miles; Zacharakis, Evangelos; Nathan, Senthil; Hines, John; Cathcart, Paul; Briggs, Tim; Kelly, John D",BJU international,https://doi.org/10.1111/bju.13189; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26033321/,344

Although PCS significantly recovered by 3-month postinjury, a number of patients still experienced persistent PCS for >1 year. As few researchers investigated long-term PCS endorsement, the present study thus aims to show the latent structure of long-term PCS and further uncover its associating factors. METHODS In total, 110 patients with MTBI and 32 healthy participants were prospectively enrolled. PCS was evaluated at 2 weeks and long-term evaluations (mean = 2.90 years) after MTBI. In addition, cognitive functions, which include memory, executive function, and information processing, and emotional disturbances, which include depression, anxiety, and irritability, were also examined at 2-week postinjury. RESULTS Patients reported significantly more PCS at 2-week postinjury than healthy participants did, but PCS significantly improved at long-term evaluations when comparing with PCS at acute stage after MTBI. Both of PCS at 2 weeks and long-term evaluations can be further subdivided into subgroups based on the severity of PCS, in which specific PCS (e.g., fatigue, loss of energy, insomnia, slowness of information processing, irritability, and blurred vision) can be well differentiated among subgroups at long-term evaluations. CONCLUSIONS This study directly showed the characteristics of long-term PCS and associating factors. It further evidenced that specific physical, cognitive, and emotional symptoms might be determinant to identify the subgroups of patients with long-term PCS endorsement.","Hsu, Huan-Hsuan; Lai, Wen-Hsuan; Yu, Hsiu-Ting; Xiao, Sheng-Huang; Tsai, Yi-Hsin; Wang, Kuo-Chuan; Huang, Sheng-Jean; Yang, Chi-Cheng",Archives of clinical neuropsychology : the official journal of the National Academy of Neuropsychologists,https://doi.org/10.1093/arclin/acaa063; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32839820/,344

BACKGROUND Reference values for optimal surgical outcomes in well-defined low-risk bariatric patients have not been established so far. Consequently, outcome comparison across centers and over time is impeded by heterogeneity in case-mix. METHODS Out of 39,424 elective BS performed in 19 high-volume academic centers from 3 continents between June 2012 and May 2017, we identified 4120 RYGB and 1457 SG low-risk cases defined by absence of previous abdominal surgery, concomitant procedures, diabetes mellitus, sleep apnea, cardiopathy, renal insufficiency, inflammatory bowel disease, immunosuppression, anticoagulation, BMI>50 kg/m and age>65 years. We chose clinically relevant endpoints covering the intra- and postoperative course. Complications were graded by severity using the comprehensive complication index. Benchmark values were defined as the 75th percentile of the participating centers' median values for respective quality indicators. RESULTS Patients were mainly females (78%), aged 38±11 years, with a baseline BMI 40.8 ± 5.8 kg/m. Over 90 days, 7.2% of RYGB and 6.2% of SG patients presented at least 1 complication and no patients died (mortality in nonbenchmark cases: 0.06%). The most frequent reasons for readmission after 90-days following both procedures were symptomatic cholelithiasis and abdominal pain of unknown origin. Benchmark values for both RYGB and SG at 90-days postoperatively were 5.5% Clavien-Dindo grade ≥IIIa complication rate, 5.5% readmission rate, and comprehensive complication index ≤33.73 in the subgroup of patients presenting at least 1 grade ≥II complication.

We identified 76 studies investigating fatigue or vitality in adults discharged from an intensive care unit and split the extracted data into three datasets: vitality scores from the Short Form Health Survey-36 (n = 54); other quantitative data (n = 19); and qualitative data (n = 9). We assessed methodological quality using critical appraisal skills programme tools. We adopted a segregated approach to mixed-methods synthesis. In a final step, we attributed combined results to one of four qualitative themes: prevalence and severity; contributing factors; impacts on quality of life; and assessment and management. Prevalence of fatigue ranged from 13.8 to 80.9%. Short Form Health Survey-36 vitality scores were commonly used as a marker of fatigue. Vitality scores reached a nadir approximately one month following ICU discharge (mean (SD) 56.44 (32.30); 95%CI 52.92-59.97). They improved over time but seldom reached reference population scores. Associated biological, disease-related and psychological factors included age, poor pre-morbid status, sleep and psychological disturbance. Qualitative data highlight the profound negative impact of fatigue on survivors' quality of life. Survivors seldom had any information provided on the potential impact of fatigue. No fatigue assessment tools specific to critical illness or evidence-based interventions were reported. Fatigue is highly prevalent in survivors of critical illness, and negatively impacts recovery. Further research on developing fatigue assessment tools specifically for critically ill patients and evaluating the impact of pharmacological and non-pharmacology interventions is needed.","Bench, S; Stayt, L; Shah, A; Dhiman, P; Czuber-Dochan, W",Anaesthesia,https://doi.org/10.1111/anae.15441; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33694157/,344
129854,Editorial policy during the lockdown.,2020-04-25,"The word « hypoxia » has recently come to the attention of the general public in two occasions, the Nobel Prize in Medicine or Physiology in 2019 and the recent COVID-19pandemics. In the academic environment, hypoxia is a current topic of research in biology, physiology and medicine: in October 2020, there were more than 150,000 occurrences of ""hypoxia"" in the PubMed database. However, the first occurrence is dated in 1945, while the interest for the effects of oxygen lack on the living organisms started in the mid 19thcentury, when scientists explored high altitude regions and mainly used the terms ""anoxia"" or ""anoxemia"". I therefore made an Internet research through multiple databases to look for the first appearance of ""hypoxia"" and related terms ""hypoxemia"" and ""hypoxybiosis"" in the scientific literature published in English, German, French, Italian and Spanish. Viault and Jolyet used ""Hypohématose"" in 1894, but this word was never used since. Hypoxybiosis appeared first in 1909 in Germany, then hypoxemia in 1923 in Austria and hypoxia in 1938 in Holland. It was then exported to United States where it appeared in 1940 in cardiology and anesthesiology. The clinical distinction between anoxia and hypoxia was clearly defined by Carl Wiggers in 1941. Hypoxia (decrease in oxygen), by essence variable in time and in localization in the body, in contrast with anoxia (absence of oxygen), illustrates the concept of homeodynamics that defines a living organism as a complex system in permanent instability, exposed to environmental and internal perturbations.","Richalet, Jean-Paul",Journal of applied physiology,https://doi.org/10.1152/japplphysiol.00936.2020; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33703942/,344

We investigated whether established infarct core size on baseline imaging modifies the relationship between onset-to-reperfusion time (OTR) and functional outcomes in patients with acute ischemic stroke treated with EVT. METHODS We analyzed a database containing individual patient data pooled from three prospective Solitaire stent retriever studies. The inclusion criteria were treatment with a Solitaire device and achievement of substantial reperfusion (modified Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction 2b-3). Main analyses were performed in patients with baseline Alberta Stroke Program Early CT Scores (ASPECTSs) of 7-10. RESULTS Among the 305 patients (mean age 67±13 years, 58% women), the proportions of patients in different categories of pretreatment infarct extent were: small (ASPECTS 9-10) 52.0%, moderate (ASPECTS 7-8) 37.1%, and large (ASPECTS 0-6) 7.6%. The mean OTR was 297±95 min. At 3 months, 60.1% of the patients achieved a good outcome. For OTRs of 2-8 hours, the rates of good outcomes at all time points were higher with higher baseline ASPECTS but declined with similar steepness. Both baseline ASPECTS (OR 1.23 (95% CI 1.04 to 1.45)) and OTR (every 30 min delay, OR 0.80 (95% CI 0.73 to 0.88)) were independently associated with a good 3-month outcome. No interaction between OTR and baseline ASPECTS was observed. CONCLUSIONS Although patients with higher baseline ASPECTS are more likely to have good clinical outcomes at all OTR intervals after 2 hours, this benefit consistently declines with time, even in patients with a small infarct core, reinforcing the need to treat all patients as quickly as possible.","Kim, Joon-Tae; Goyal, Mayank; Levy, Elad I; Liebeskind, David; Jahan, Reza; Pereira, Vitor M; Gralla, Jan; Bonafe, Alain; Saver, Jeffrey L",Journal of neurointerventional surgery,https://doi.org/10.1136/neurintsurg-2019-014906; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31266857/,344

131326,The devil is in the details: an analysis of patient rights in Swiss cancer registries.,2021-10-05,"BACKGROUND Accurate estimation of the case-fatality (CF) rate, or the proportion of cases that die, is central to pandemic planning. While estimates of CF rates for past influenza pandemics have ranged from about 0.1% (1957 and 1968 pandemics) to 2.5% (1918 pandemic), the official World Health Organization estimate for the current outbreak of H5N1 avian influenza to date is around 60%. METHODS AND RESULTS The official estimate of the H5N1 CF rate has been described by some as an over-estimate, with little relevance to the rate that would be encountered under pandemic conditions. The reasons for such opinions are typically: (i) numerous undetected asymptomatic/mild cases, (ii) under-reporting of cases by some countries for economic or other reasons, and (iii) an expected decrease in virulence if and when the virus becomes widely transmitted in humans. Neither current data nor current literature, however, adequately supports these scenarios. While the real H5N1 CF rate could be lower than the current estimate of 60%, it is unlikely that it will be at the 0.1-0.4% level currently embraced by many pandemic plans. We suggest that, based on surveillance and seroprevalence studies conducted in several countries, the real H5N1 CF rate should be closer to 14-33%. CONCLUSIONS Clearly, if such a CF rate were to be sustained in a pandemic, H5N1 would present a truly dreadful scenario. A concerted and dedicated effort by the international community to avert a pandemic through combating avian influenza in animals and humans in affected countries needs to be a global priority.","Li, F C K; Choi, B C K; Sly, T; Pak, A W P",Journal of epidemiology and community health,https://doi.org/10.1136/jech.2007.064030; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18477756/,344

Persistent, low-level transgene expression from the rHuAd5 vector sustains the CD8(+) T-cell memory population and a nonhematopoietic cell compartment appears to be involved in long-term presentation of adenoviral antigens.

The purpose of the present study was to retrospectively evaluate the incidence of wound complications in patients who underwent wound closure with stainless steel staples or subcuticular sutures in surgery for gynecologic malignancies and to retrospectively determine the risk factors for wound complications. PATIENTS AND METHODS From April 2007 through March 2012, a cohort of 317 consecutive patients undergoing surgery for gynecologic malignancies was evaluated in the retrospective study. The skin was closed with stainless steel staples before March 2010 (staples group). From April 2010, the skin was closed by subcuticular suturing (subcuticular group). We compared the incidence of wound complications between 2 groups and evaluated independent multivariate associations with the effect of clinical parameters on occurrence of wound complications. RESULTS The incidence of wound disruption was 7.3% (23/317): 12.1% (17/140) in the staples group and 3.4% (6/177) in the subcuticular group (P = 0.0029). The incidence of wound infection was 2.5% (8/317): 5.0% (7/140) in the staples group and 0.6% (1/177) in the subcuticular group (P = 0.0124). Multivariate analyses performed with wound disruption as the end point revealed long-term steroid treatment, subcutaneous thickness, and skin staples as independent predictors. Subcutaneous thickness and skin staples were independent factors significantly associated with the possibility of wound infection.

132835,Diversity in Medical Schools: A Much-Needed New Beginning.,2021-01-05,"Identifying disease-related genes is of importance for understanding of molecule mechanisms of diseases, as well as diagnosis and treatment of diseases. Many computational methods have been proposed to predict disease-related genes, but how to make full use of multi-source biological data to enhance the ability of disease-gene prediction is still challenging. In this paper, we proposed a novel method for predicting disease-related genes by using fast network embedding (PrGeFNE), which can integrate multiple types of associations related to diseases and genes. Specifically, we first constructed a heterogeneous network by using phenotype-disease, disease-gene, protein-protein and gene-GO associations; and low-dimensional representation of nodes is extracted from the network by using a fast network embedding algorithm. Then, a dual-layer heterogeneous network was reconstructed by using the low-dimensional representation, and a network propagation was applied to the dual-layer heterogeneous network to predict disease-related genes. Through cross-validation and newly added-association validation, we displayed the important roles of different types of association data in enhancing the ability of disease-gene prediction, and confirmed the excellent performance of PrGeFNE by comparing to state-of-the-art algorithms. Furthermore, we developed a web tool that can facilitate researchers to search for candidate genes of different diseases predicted by PrGeFNE, along with the enrichment analysis of GO and pathway on candidate gene set. This may be useful for investigation of diseases' molecular mechanisms as well as their experimental validations. The web tool is available at http://bioinformatics.csu.edu.cn/prgefne/.","Xiang, Ju; Zhang, Ning-Rui; Zhang, Jia-Shuai; Lv, Xiao-Yi; Li, Min",Methods,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ymeth.2020.06.015; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32610158/,344

There is a lack of experience and guidance in dealing with this increased demand on an already overburdened health care system. We created an online tool (www.covidbacklog.com) that helps surgeons explore how resource allocation within their group will affect wait times for patients. After inputting a handful of readily available variables, the computer program generates a forecast of how long it will take to see the backlog of patients. This information could be used to allow surgical groups to run simulations to explore different resource allocation strategies in order to help prevent downstream consequences of delayed patient care.","Brandman, David M; Leck, Erika; Christie, Sean",Canadian journal of surgery.

Around blood vessels, nodular cell accumulations consisted of CD4-positive and CD8-positive T cells and CD68-positive microglia and macrophages; neutrophils were found rarely. These findings are similar to those of previously reported R. prowazekii tissue specimen testing.

Partnerships with industry have facilitated the development of advanced technical instruments, light sources, recording devices and optics which are almost out of date by the time they are introduced to surgical practice. However, lest we think that technological innovation is entirely a modern concept, we should remember that our predecessors were masters of their craft and able to apply new technologies to surgical practice.

Previous publications have validated the patient factors that increase the risk of mortality; however, it is currently a rare event. The development of a metabolic acuity score (MAS) to augment the body mass index might allow for accurate preoperative assessment and optimal treatment of patients. The present study has proposed a MAS for decreasing major complications. METHODS Prospectively collected outcomes of 2416 patients undergoing Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (n = 1821) or laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding (n = 595) in a community hospital were evaluated for the incidence of major complications, readmissions, and reoperations. Beginning in August of 2006, 1072 patients were divided into MAS groups of 1-4 according to age, body mass index, weight, history of deep vein thrombosis/pulmonary embolism, sleep apnea, diabetes, hypertension, immobility, heart disease, and psychological classification. The acuity groups were compared with each other and with 1344 patients who underwent treatment before the MAS was implemented. RESULTS A significant decrease occurred in the readmission rates within 30 days after the MAS was put into practice (8.5% before MAS versus 1.7% after MAS, P <.001) for the Roux-en-Y gastric bypass patients. The postoperative infection rates were lower after implementing the MAS (3.5% before MAS, .7% after MAS, P <.001). After adjusting for random and fixed effects of covariates, the implementation of the MAS significantly reduced the incidence of postoperative internal hernias, infections, deep vein thrombosis, readmissions, and reoperations. CONCLUSION Recognition of specific patient acuity characteristics through the implementation of MAS and aggressive preoperative and perioperative management led to lower major complication rates and decreased the incidence of readmissions and reoperations after bariatric surgery.","Blackstone, Robin P; Cortés, Melisa C",Surgery for obesity and related diseases : official journal of the American Society for Bariatric Surgery,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.soard.2009.09.010; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20005783/,344

The aim was to systematically review the existing evidence to assess the effectiveness of alternative listening devices in adults with mild and moderate hearing loss. A systematic search strategy of the scientific literature was employed, reported in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) checklist. Eleven studies met eligibility for inclusion: two studies evaluated personal sound amplification products, and nine studies assessed remote microphone systems (frequency modulation, Bluetooth, wireless). The evidence in this review suggests that alternative listening devices improve behavioural measures of speech intelligibility relative to unaided and/or aided conditions. Evidence for whether alternative listening devices improve self-reported outcomes is inconsistent. The evidence was judged to be of poor to good quality and subject to bias due to limitations in study design. Our overall recommendation is that high-quality evidence (i.e. randomised controlled trials) is required to demonstrate the effectiveness of alternative listening devices. Such evidence is not currently available and is necessary to guide healthcare commissioners and policymakers when considering new service delivery models for adults with hearing loss.

Early and accurate detection of gastrointestinal pathogens is important to initiate the appropriate type of therapy. Multiplex molecular gastrointestinal panels rapidly detect several gastrointestinal pathogens at once with high sensitivity.Areas covered: We assess the scope and limitations of several multiplex gastrointestinal panels approved by the Food and Drug Administration or marked by Conformité Européenne-in vitro diagnostic. We compare 10 syndromic gastrointestinal panels, 14 bacteria-specific multiplex panels, seven parasite-specific multiplex panels, and eight virus-specific multiplex panels.Expert opinion: Thanks to the advances made in the diagnostic approaches for gastrointestinal infections, there are various panels to choose. The choice of a specific syndromic gastrointestinal multiplex panel should be made to improve patient care. Diagnostic syndromic multiplex approaches for gastrointestinal infections should be customized; each hospital should develop its diagnostic algorithm for gastrointestinal infections tailored to its setting, study population, and geographical site. Current multiplex gastrointestinal panels could be improved by including the detection of antimicrobial resistance, toxigenic Clostridioides difficile, and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic).","Maldonado-Garza, Héctor Jesús; Garza-González, Elvira; Bocanegra-Ibarias, Paola; Flores-Treviño, Samantha",Expert review of gastroenterology & hepatology,https://doi.org/10.1080/17474124.2021.1899807; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33682566/,344

Here, we evaluated the effectiveness of pulse-steroid in case of unresponsiveness to treatment with high dose steroid. MATERIAL AND METHODS The study is a retrospective controlled trial. We divided the patients in three groups: Standard-care therapy alone, high-dose steroid treatment and pulse-steroid treatment (250 mg/day methy-prednisolone). One hundred fifty patients were enrolled in each group. All patients were hospitalized and needed oxygen support. We matched the patients according to disease severity at the onset of hypoxia, weight of co-morbidities, age and gender. We then compared three groups in terms of mortality, length of hospitalization, need for intensive care unit (ICU) admission and mechanical ventilation (MV), length of stay in ICU and duration of MV. RESULTS The pulse-steroid group had shorter ICU stay. The median ICU stay was 9.0(CI 95% 6.0-12.0) days in standard ?care group, 8.0(CI 95% 5.0-13.0) days in high-dose steroid group and 4.5(CI %95 3.0-8.0) days in pulse-steroid group. Moreover, although they were initially unresponsive to steroid therapy, they achieved similar results compared to the high-dose steroid group in other outcomes except for length of hospital stay. CONCLUSIONS Pulse-steroid treatment would be an option for COVID-19 patients who do not respond to the initial high-dose steroid treatment.","Batirel, Ayşe; Demirhan, Recep; Eser, Nurullah; Körlü, Ezgi; Tezcan, Mehmet Engin",Turkish journal of medical sciences,https://doi.org/10.3906/sag-2101-243; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33878858/,344
136961,How Slovakia Is Handling the Outbreak?,2020-06-10,"BACKGROUND Many techniques have been used to treat palmar hyperhidrosis. Compensatory sweating is a difficult adverse effect. Clipping has been proposed because of its supposed reversibility when clips are removed at a later date. The primary aims of this article are to investigate the neuronal lesion of the sympathetic chain caused by clipping and to study the possibility of regeneration after removal of the clips. METHODS We performed an experimental study at the Minimally Invasive Surgery Centre Jesus Uson in Caceres (Spain). We used a swine model, performing clipping, unclipping, and extirpation of different segments of sympathetic chain with clips and after clip removal, following a chronogram of 10, 20, and 30 days. Pathologic studies of specimens and statistics were done at the University of Seville. RESULTS Ten days after clipping, all sympathetic chains displayed evident Wallerian degeneration. Twenty days after clipping, Wallerian degeneration of myelinated fibers was more widespread and also more striking. Thirty days after clipping, a very marked macrophagic reaction was visible, with multiple signs of phagocytosis of myelin debris. By 30 days post operation and 20 days after clip removal, a few residual myelin and amyelinated fibers were visible. These findings suggest that axon regeneration is not possible. CONCLUSIONS There are Wallerian degeneration and axon loss 10 days after clipping. The almost total absence of myelinated and amyelinated fibers following clip removal suggests that there was no nerve regeneration, and that therefore clipping cannot be considered a reversible technique.","Loscertales, Jesus; Congregado, Miguel; Jimenez-Merchan, Rafael; Gallardo, Gregorio; Trivino, Ana; Moreno, Sergio; Loscertales, Beatriz; Galera-Ruiz, Hugo",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-011-2023-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22083329/,344

BACKGROUND The role of DM is to minimize and prevent further spread of the contagion over an extended period of time. This requires addressing large-scale logistics, coordination, and specialized training needs. However, DM-related challenges during the pandemic response and recovery are significantly different than with other kinds of disasters. METHOD An expert review was conducted to document issues relevant to human factors and ergonomics (HFE) in DM. RESULTS The response to the COVID-19 crisis has presented complex and unique challenges to DM and public health practitioners. Compared to other disasters and previous pandemics, the COVID-19 outbreak has had an unprecedented scale, magnitude, and propagation rate. The high technical complexity of response and DM coupled with lack of mental model and expertise to respond to such a unique disaster has seriously challenged the response work systems. Recent research has investigated the role of HFE in modeling DM systems' characteristics to improve resilience, accelerating emergency management expertise, developing agile training methods to facilitate dynamically changing response, improving communication and coordination among system elements, mitigating occupational hazards including guidelines for the design of personal protective equipment, and improving procedures to enhance efficiency and effectiveness of response efforts. CONCLUSION This short review highlights the potential for the field's contribution to proactive and resilient DM for the ongoing and future pandemics.","Sasangohar, Farzan; Moats, Jason; Mehta, Ranjana; Peres, S Camille",Human factors,https://doi.org/10.1177/0018720820939428; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32648781/,344

It is important for rural health care professionals to be prepared for a bioterrorist attack or other public health emergency. We sought to determine the barriers impeding rural physicians from being prepared for a human-induced disaster such as a bioterrorist attack. METHODS This study employed a qualitative methodology using key informant interviews followed by grounded theory methods for data analysis. Semistructured interviews were conducted with 6 physicians in the state of Florida from federally designated rural areas. RESULTS The interview participants articulated primary barriers and the associated factors contributing to these barriers that may affect rural physician preparedness for human-induced emergencies. Rural physicians identified 3 primary barriers: accessibility to health care, communication between physicians and patients, and rural infrastructure and resources. Each of these barriers included associated factors and influences. For instance, according to our participants, access to care was affected by a lack of health insurance, a lack of finances for health services, and transportation difficulties. CONCLUSIONS Existing rural organizational infrastructure and resources are insufficient to meet current health needs owing to a number of factors including the paucity of health care providers, particularly medical specialists, and the associated patient-level barriers. These barriers presumably would be exacerbated in the advent of a human-induced public health emergency. Thus, strategically implemented health policies are needed to mitigate the barriers identified in this study.","Putzer, Gavin J; Koro-Ljungberg, Mirka; Duncan, R Paul",Disaster medicine and public health preparedness,https://doi.org/10.1001/dmp.2012.59; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23241464/,344

We sought to determine the relationships between: (a) trait hope, expectation of symptom benefit from chemotherapy, and anxiety and depression; (b) hope and perceived efficacy of chemotherapy; and (c) unfulfilled hope (where expectations for benefit are not fulfilled) and depression. Methods. Adult patients enrolled within stage 1 of the Gynecologic Cancer Intergroup Symptom Benefit Study were included. Patient. Reported outcomes were collected from 126 women with predominantly platinum-resistant ovarian cancer at baseline, prior to the first four treatment cycles (12-16 weeks), and four weeks after completing chemotherapy or at disease progression, whichever came first. Associations were assessed with Spearman rank correlation coefficient (r) and odds ratio. Results. Trait hope and expectation of symptom benefit from chemotherapy were weakly correlated with each other (r = 0.25). Trait hope, but not expectation of symptom benefit, was negatively correlated with anxiety (r = -0.43) and depression (r = -0.50). The smaller the discrepancy between perceived and expected symptom benefit, the less likely the patient was to have scores indicative of depression (odds ratio: 0.68; 95% confidence interval: 0.49-0.96; p = .026). Conclusion. Trait hope and expectation of symptom benefit from chemotherapy appear to be distinct and independent of the aspects of quality of life and scores for depression. Hope did not appear to affect perceived efficacy of chemotherapy in alleviating symptoms, but women whose expectation of symptom benefit from chemotherapy was not fulfilled were more likely to have scores indicative of depression. It may be preferable to encourage hope toward achievable goals rather than toward benefits from chemotherapy.","Sjoquist, Katrin M; Friedlander, Michael L; O'Connell, Rachel L; Voysey, Merryn; King, Madeleine T; Stockler, Martin R; Oza, Amit M; Gillies, Kim; Martyn, Julie K; Butow, Phyllis N",The oncologist,https://doi.org/10.1634/theoncologist.2013-0175; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24107972/,344

Also, the understanding of this host health-gut microbiota relationship can create an opportunity to control an individual's health by manipulating the gut microbiota composition. Several approaches like administration of probiotic, prebiotics, synbiotics, faecal microbiota transplantation have been tried to mitigate the dysbiosis originated ill effects. But the effects of these approaches are highly generic and non-specific. This creates the necessity to design personalized medicine that focuses on treatment of specific disease considering the individual specific gut microbiome. The health promoting commensals could be the new promising prophylactic and therapeutic agents for designing personalized medicine. These commensals are designated as next-generation probiotics (NGPs) and their unusual characteristics, unknown identity and special growth requirements have presented difficulties for researcher, industrial exploitation, and regulatory agencies.

This paper has proposed a mathematical model for studying its transmission dynamics in the presence of face mask wearing and hospitalization services of human population in Tanzania. Disease-free and endemic equilibria were determined and subsequently their local and global stabilities were carried out. The trace-determinant approach was used in the local stability of disease-free equilibrium point while Lyapunov function technique was used to determine the global stability of both disease-free and endemic equilibrium points. Basic reproduction number, R 0 , was determined in which its numerical results revealed that, in the presence of face masks wearing and medication services or hospitalization as preventive measure for its transmission, R 0 = 0.698 while in their absence R 0 = 3.8 .

141837,Introducing general practice enrolment in Australia: the devil is in the detail.,2021-04-19,"Complement activation is a recognised mediator of myocardial ischaemia-reperfusion-injury (IRI) and cardiomyocytes are a known source of complement proteins including the central component C3, whose activation products can mediate tissue inflammation, cell death and profibrotic signalling. We investigated the potential to detect and quantify the stable covalently bound product C3d by external body imaging, as a marker of complement activation in heart muscle in a murine model of myocardial IRI. We used single-photon-emission-computed-tomography (SPECT) in conjunction with 99mTechnecium-labelled recombinant complement receptor 2 (99mTc-rCR2), which specifically detects C3d at the site of complement activation. Compared to control imaging with an inactive CR2 mutant (99mTc-K41E CR2) or an irrelevant protein (99mTc-PSMA) or using 99mTc-rCR2 in C3-deficient mice, the use of 99mTc-rCR2 in complement-intact mice gave specific uptake in the reperfused myocardium. The heart to skeletal muscle ratio of 99mTc-rCR2 was significantly higher than in the three control groups. Histological analysis confirmed specific uptake of 99mTc-rCR2. Following therapeutic inhibition of complement C3 activation, we found reduced myocardial uptake of 99mTc-rCR2. We conclude, therefore that 99mTc-rCR2 imaging can be used for non-invasive detection of activated complement and in future could be exploited to quantify the severity of myocardial damage due to complement activation.","Sharif-Paghaleh, Ehsan; Yap, May Lin; Puhl, Sarah-Lena; Badar, Adam; Torres, Julia Baguña; Chuamsaamarkkee, Krisanat; Kampmeier, Florian; Smith, Richard A; Clark, James; Blower, Philip J; Sacks, Steven; Mullen, Gregory E",Scientific reports,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-017-16387-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29170426/,344

In HIV-1 infection cases, assessing the efficacy of treatment interventions that are superimposed on combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) has benefited tremendously from the development of sensitive HIV-1 DNA and RNA quantitation assays. Simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) infection of Rhesus macaques is similar in many key aspects to human HIV-1 infection and consequently this non-human primate (NHP) model has and continues to prove instrumental in evaluating HIV prevention, treatment and eradication approaches. Cell and tissue associated HIV-1 viral nucleic acids have been found to serve as useful predictors of disease outcome and indicators of treatment efficacy, highlighting the value of and the need for sensitive detection of viruses in cells/tissues from infected individuals or animal models. However, viral nucleic acid detection and quantitation in such sample sources can often be complicated by high nucleic acid input (that is required to detect ultralow level viruses in, for example, cure research) or inhibitors, leading to reduced detection sensitivity and under-quantification, and confounded result interpretation. Here, we present a step-by-step procedure to quantitatively recover cell/tissue associated viral DNA and RNA, using SIV-infected Rhesus macaque cells and tissues as model systems, and subsequently quantify the viral DNA and RNA with an ultrasensitive SIV droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) assay and reverse transcription ddPCR (RT-ddPCR) assay, respectively, on the Raindance ddPCR platform. The procedure can be readily adapted for a broad range of applications where highly sensitive nucleic acid detection and quantitation are required.","Long, Samuel; Berkemeier, Brian",Methods,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ymeth.2021.04.025; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33957204/,344
142670,LncRNA AFAP1-AS1 modulates the sensitivity of paclitaxel-resistant prostate cancer cells to paclitaxel via miR-195-5p/FKBP1A axis.,2020-11-03,"BACKGROUND The US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommends out-of-office blood pressure (BP) testing to exclude white coat hypertension prior to hypertension diagnosis. Despite improved availability and coverage of home and 24-h ambulatory BP monitoring (HBPM, ABPM), both are infrequently used to confirm diagnoses. We used the Behavior Change Wheel (BCW) framework, a multi-step process for mapping barriers to theory-informed behavior change techniques, to develop a multi-component implementation strategy for increasing out-of-office BP testing for hypertension diagnosis. Informed by geographically diverse provider focus groups (n = 63) exploring barriers to out-of-office testing and key informant interviews (n = 12), a multi-disciplinary team (medicine, psychology, nursing) used rigorous mixed methods to develop, refine, locally adapt, and finalize intervention components. The purpose of this report is to describe the protocol of the Effects of a Multi-faceted intervention on Blood pRessure Actions in the primary Care Environment (EMBRACE) trial, a cluster randomized control trial evaluating whether a theory-informed multi-component strategy increased out-of-office testing for hypertension diagnosis. METHODS/DESIGN The EMBRACE Trial patient sample will include all adults ≥ 18 years of age with a newly elevated office BP (≥ 140/90 mmHg) at a scheduled visit with a primary care provider from a study clinic. All providers with scheduled visits with adult primary care patients at enrolled ACN primary care clinics were included. We determined that the most feasible, effective implementation strategy would include delivering education about out-of-office testing, demonstration/instruction on how to perform out-of-office HBPM and ABPM testing, feedback on completion rates of out-of-office testing, environmental prompts/cues via computerized clinical decision support (CDS) tool, and a culturally tailored, locally accessible ABPM testing service. We are currently comparing the effect of this locally adapted multi-component strategy with usual care on the change in the proportion of eligible patients who complete out-of-office BP testing in a 1:1 cluster randomized trial across 8 socioeconomically diverse clinics. CONCLUSIONS The EMBRACE trial is the first trial to test an implementation strategy for improving out-of-office testing for hypertension diagnosis. It will elucidate the degree to which targeting provider behavior via education, reminders, and decision support in addition to providing an ABPM testing service will improve referral to and completion of ABPM and HBPMs. TRIAL REGISTRATION Clinicaltrials.gov , NCT03480217 , Registered on 29 March 2018.","Moise, Nathalie; Phillips, Erica; Carter, Eileen; Alcantara, Carmela; Julian, Jacob; Thanataveerat, Anusorn; Schwartz, Joseph E; Ye, Siqin; Duran, Andrea; Shimbo, Daichi; Kronish, Ian M",Implementation science : IS,https://doi.org/10.1186/s13012-020-01017-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32771002/,344
142689,The perils of preprints.,2020-08-17,"BACKGROUND Antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) is an autoimmune disease characterised by the presence of antiphospholipid (aPL) antibodies that have prothrombotic activity. Antiphospholipid antibodies are associated with an increased risk of pregnancy complications (recurrent miscarriage, premature birth, intrauterine growth retardation) and thrombotic events (both arterial and venous). The most common thrombotic events include brain ischaemia (stroke or transient ischaemic attack) and deep vein thrombosis. To diagnose APS, the presence of aPL antibodies in two measurements and at least one thrombotic event or pregnancy complication are required. It is unclear if people with positive aPL antibodies but without any previous thrombotic events should receive primary antithrombotic prophylaxis. OBJECTIVES To assess the effects of antiplatelet or anticoagulant agents versus placebo or no intervention or other intervention on the development of thrombosis in people with aPL antibodies who have not had a thrombotic event. We did not address obstetric outcomes in this review as these have been thoroughly addressed by other Cochrane Reviews. SEARCH METHODS We searched the Cochrane Vascular Specialised Register (4 December 2017), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (last search 29 November 2017), MEDLINE Ovid, Embase Ovid, CINAHL, and AMED (searched 4 December 2017), and trials registries (searched 29 November 2017). We also checked reference lists of included studies, systematic reviews, and practice guidelines, and contacted experts in the field. SELECTION CRITERIA We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared any antiplatelet or anticoagulant agents, or their combinations, at any dose and mode of delivery with placebo, no intervention, or other intervention. We also included RCTs that compared antiplatelet or anticoagulant agents with each other or that compared two different doses of the same drug. We included studies performed in people of any age and with no history of thrombosis (as defined by APS Sapporo classification criteria or updated Sydney classification criteria), but with aPL antibodies confirmed on at last two separate measurements. The studies included both pregnant women who tested positive for aPL antibodies and had a history of recurrent obstetric complications, as well as non-pregnancy related cases with positive screening for antibodies, in accordance with the criteria mentioned above. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS Pairs of authors independently selected studies for inclusion, extracted data, and assessed the risk of bias for the included studies and quality of evidence using GRADE. Any discrepancies were resolved through discussion or by consulting a third review author when necessary. In addition, one review author checked all the extracted numerical data. MAIN RESULTS We included nine studies involving 1044 randomised participants. The studies took place in several countries and had different funding sources. No study was at low risk of bias in all domains. We classified all included studies as at unclear or high risk of bias in two or more domains. Seven included studies focused mainly on obstetric outcomes. One study included non-pregnancy-related cases, and one study included both pregnancy-related cases and other patients with positive results for aPL antibodies. The remaining studies concerned women with aPL antibodies and a history of pregnancy failure. Four studies compared anticoagulant with or without acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) versus ASA only and observed no clear difference in thrombosis risk (risk ratio (RR) 0.98, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.25 to 3.77; 4 studies; 493 participants; low-quality evidence). No major bleeding was reported, but minor bleeding risk (nasal bleeding, menorrhagia) was higher in the anticoagulant with ASA group as compared with ASA alone in one study (RR 22.45, 95% CI 1.34 to 374.81; 1 study; 164 participants; low-quality evidence). In one study ASA was compared with placebo, and there were no clear differences in thrombosis (RR 5.21, 95% CI 0.63 to 42.97; 1 study; 98 participants; low-quality evidence) or minor bleeding risk between the groups (RR 3.13, 95% CI 0.34 to 29.01; 1 study; 98 participants; low-quality evidence), and no major bleeding was observed. Two studies compared ASA with low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) versus placebo or intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), and no thrombotic events were observed in any of the groups. Moreover, there were no clear differences in the risk of bleeding requiring transfusion (RR 9.0, 95% CI 0.49 to 164.76; 1 study; 180 participants; moderate-quality evidence) or postpartum bleeding (RR 1.30, 95% CI 0.60 to 2.81; 1 study; 180 participants; moderate-quality evidence) between the groups. Two studies compared ASA with high-dose LMWH versus ASA with low-dose LMWF or unfractionated heparin (UFH); no thrombotic events or major bleeding was reported. Mortality and quality of life data were not reported for any of the comparisons. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS There is insufficient evidence to demonstrate benefit or harm of using anticoagulants with or without ASA versus ASA alone in people with aPL antibodies and a history of recurrent pregnancy loss and with no such history; ASA versus placebo in people with aPL antibodies; and ASA with LMWH versus placebo or IVIG, and ASA with high-dose LMWH versus ASA with low-dose LMWH or UFH, in women with aPL antibodies and a history of recurrent pregnancy loss, for the primary prevention of thrombotic events. In a mixed population of people with a history of previous pregnancy loss and without such a history treated with anticoagulant combined with ASA, the incidence of minor bleeding (nasal bleeding, menorrhagia) was increased when compared with ASA alone. Studies that are adequately powered and that focus mainly on thrombotic events are needed to draw any firm conclusions on the primary prevention of thrombotic events in people with antiphospholipid antibodies.","Bala, Malgorzata M; Paszek, Elżbieta; Lesniak, Wiktoria; Wloch-Kopec, Dorota; Jasinska, Katarzyna; Undas, Anetta",The Cochrane database of systematic reviews,https://doi.org/10.1002/14651858.cd012534.pub2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30004572/,344

A combination of buspirone and melatonin displayed antidepressant activity in these assays whereas neither buspirone nor melatonin alone showed any antidepressant-like profile. After evaluating numerous combination ratios, we determined that low dose buspirone 15 mg combined with melatonin-SR 3 mg yielded optimal antidepressant efficacy in our pre-clinical platform. The low dose of buspirone suggested that antidepressant efficacy might be achieved with only minimal adverse event liability. Based on these data, we conducted an exploratory 6-week, multi-center, double-blind, randomized, placebo- and comparator-controlled study of the combination of buspirone and melatonin in subjects with acute Major Depressive Disorder (MDD). The combination treatment revealed a significant antidepressant response in subjects with MDD on several measures (Clinical Global Impression of Severity and Improvement, Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology) compared to either placebo or buspirone 15 mg monotherapy. These preliminary findings have clinical implications and suggest that a platform of pre-clinical neurogenesis matched with confirmatory behavioral assays may be useful as a drug discovery strategy.","Fava, Maurizio; Targum, Steven D; Nierenberg, Andrew A; Bleicher, Leo S; Carter, Todd A; Wedel, Pamela C; Hen, René; Gage, Fred H; Barlow, Carrolee",Journal of psychiatric research,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpsychires.2012.08.013; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22998742/,344
143145,"Justice, diversity, and research ethics review.",2021-03-19,"ABSTRACT Genitourinary syndrome of menopause (GSM) refers to a collection of symptoms resulting from diminished hormonal, primarily estrogenic stimulation to the vulvovaginal or lower urinary tract and may affect up to 50% of postmenopausal women. Symptoms, which are typically progressive and unlikely to resolve spontaneously, may include, but are not limited to, vulvovaginal dryness, burning or irritation, dyspareunia, or urinary symptoms of urgency, dysuria or recurrent urinary tract infection. These symptoms are typically progressive and unlikely to resolve spontaneously. Diagnosis is clinical. Telemedicine may play a role in diagnosis, initiation of treatment, and follow-up of women with GSM. Effective treatments include moisturizers and lubricants, local hormonal therapy with estrogen or dehydroepiandrosterone, and oral selective estrogen receptor agonists. Laser or radiofrequency procedures, although currently utilized, are being studied to comprehensively understand their overall effectiveness and safety. Additionally, the influence and effect of the vaginal microbiome, as well as potential of treatment via its manipulation, is being studied. We performed a literature search of PubMed, Google Scholar, and Ovid with search terms of vulvovaginal atrophy and GSM and reviewed major US Society Guidelines to create this narrative review of this topic. The literature suggests that healthcare providers can make a significant impact of the health and quality of life of women by being proactive about discussing and providing interventions for GSM. A systematic approach with consideration of current guidelines and attention to developing protocols for interventions should be employed.

Mathematical models are important tools to estimate disease burden and to assess the cost-effectiveness of interventions to address this burden. METHODS We carried out a systematic review on models, searching main health literature databases up to July 2017. Pairs of reviewers independently selected, extracted data and assessed the quality of the included studies. Discrepancies were resolved by consensus. We selected those models exploring: a) disease burden (main metrics being attributable deaths, disability-adjusted life years, quality-adjusted life years) or b) economic evaluations of health interventions or policies, based on models including the aforementioned outcomes. We grouped models into broad families according to their common central methodological approach. RESULTS Out of 4295 reports identified, 63 met our inclusion criteria and were categorized in three main model families that were described in detail: 1) State transition -i.e Markov- models, 2) Life Table-based models and 3) Attributable fraction-based models. Most studies pertained to the latter one (n = 29, 48.3%). A few miscellaneous models could not be framed into these families. CONCLUSIONS Our findings can be useful for future researchers and decision makers planning to undertake alcohol-related disease burden or cost-effectiveness studies. We found several different families of models.

146259,Entering the new ICE age with Watchman FLX.,2021-02-02,"Stress granule (SG) formation is generally triggered as a result of stress-induced translation arrest. The impact of SG formation on virus replication varies among different viruses, and the significance of SGs in coronavirus (CoV) replication is largely unknown. The present study examined the biological role of SGs in Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)-CoV replication. The MERS-CoV 4a accessory protein is known to inhibit SG formation in cells in which it was expressed by binding to double-stranded RNAs and inhibiting protein kinase R (PKR)-mediated phosphorylation of the α subunit of eukaryotic initiation factor 2 (eIF2α). Replication of MERS-CoV lacking the genes for 4a and 4b (MERS-CoV-Δp4), but not MERS-CoV, induced SG accumulation in MERS-CoV-susceptible HeLa/CD26 cells, while replication of both viruses failed to induce SGs in Vero cells, demonstrating cell type-specific differences in MERS-CoV-Δp4-induced SG formation. MERS-CoV-Δp4 replicated less efficiently than MERS-CoV in HeLa/CD26 cells, and inhibition of SG formation by small interfering RNA-mediated depletion of the SG components promoted MERS-CoV-Δp4 replication, demonstrating that SG formation was detrimental for MERS-CoV replication. Inefficient MERS-CoV-Δp4 replication was not due to either the induction of type I and type III interferons or the accumulation of viral mRNAs in the SGs. Rather, it was due to the inefficient translation of viral proteins, which was caused by high levels of PKR-mediated eIF2α phosphorylation and likely by the confinement of various factors that are required for translation in the SGs. Finally, we established that deletion of the 4a gene alone was sufficient for inducing SGs in infected cells. Our study revealed that 4a-mediated inhibition of SG formation facilitates viral translation, leading to efficient MERS-CoV replication.IMPORTANCE Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) causes respiratory failure with a high case fatality rate in patients, yet effective antivirals and vaccines are currently not available. Stress granule (SG) formation is one of the cellular stress responses to virus infection and is generally triggered as a result of stress-induced translation arrest. SGs can be beneficial or detrimental for virus replication, and the biological role of SGs in CoV infection is unclear. The present study showed that the MERS-CoV 4a accessory protein, which was reported to block SG formation in cells in which it was expressed, inhibited SG formation in infected cells. Our data suggest that 4a-mediated inhibition of SG formation facilitates the translation of viral mRNAs, resulting in efficient virus replication. To our knowledge, this report is the first to show the biological significance of SG in CoV replication and provides insight into the interplay between MERS-CoV and antiviral stress responses.","Nakagawa, Keisuke; Narayanan, Krishna; Wada, Masami; Makino, Shinji",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.00902-18; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30068649/,344
146646,People are to blame for Covid-19.,2020-05-02,"Osimertinib, which is a third-generation epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor, is an important anticancer drug because of its high efficacy and excellent safety profile. However, resistance against osimertinib is inevitable; therefore, therapeutic strategies to overcome the resistance are needed. Doxazosin, a classic quinazoline-based alpha 1-adrenoceptor antagonist is used to treat hypertension and benign prostatic hyperplasia with a known safety profile. The anticancer effects of doxazosin have been examined in various types of malignancies from the viewpoint of drug repositioning or repurposing. However, it currently remains unclear whether doxazosin sensitizes cancer cells to osimertinib. Herein, we demonstrated that doxazosin induced autophagy and enhanced the anticancer effects of osimertinib on the cancer cells and cancer stem cells of non-small cell lung cancer, pancreatic cancer, and glioblastoma at a concentration at which the growth of non-tumor cells was not affected. The osimertinib-sensitizing effects of doxazosin were suppressed by 3-methyladenine, an inhibitor of autophagy, which suggested that the effects of doxazosin were mediated by autophagy. The present study provides evidence for the efficacy of doxazosin as a combination therapy with osimertinib to overcome resistance against osimertinib.","Suzuki, Shuhei; Yamamoto, Masahiro; Sanomachi, Tomomi; Togashi, Keita; Sugai, Asuka; Seino, Shizuka; Okada, Masashi; Yoshioka, Takashi; Kitanaka, Chifumi",Biomedicines,https://doi.org/10.3390/biomedicines8080273; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32764319/,344
146968,How can I make the most of my time shielding?,2020-06-22,"Currently vaccines protecting from COVID-19 are a scarce resource. Prioritising vaccination for certain groups of society is placed in a context of uncertainty due to changing evidence on the available vaccines and changing infection dynamics. To meet accepted ethical standards of procedural justice and individual autonomy, vaccine allocation strategies need to state reasons for prioritisation explicitly while at the same time communicating the expected risks and benefits of vaccination at different times and with different vaccines transparently. In this article, we provide a concept summarising epidemiological considerations underlying current vaccine prioritisation strategies in an accessible way. We define six priority groups (vulnerable individuals, persons in close contact with the vulnerable, key workers with direct work-related contact with the public, key workers without direct work-related contact to the public, dependents of key workers and members of groups with high interpersonal contact rates) and state vaccine priorities for them. Additionally, prioritisation may follow non-epidemiological considerations including the aim to increase intra-societal justice and reducing inequality. While national prioritisation plans integrate many of these concepts, the international community has so far failed to guarantee equitable or procedurally just access to vaccines across settings with different levels of wealth.","Kohns Vasconcelos, Malte; Marazia, Chantal; Koniordou, Markela; Fangerau, Heiner; Drexler, Ingo; Afum-Adjei Awuah, Anthony",Pathogens and global health,https://doi.org/10.1080/20477724.2021.1932136; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34107233/,344

METHODS A retrospective study was conducted with 73 patients who had thrombosed arteriovenous fistulas and were treated with endovascular methods. Patient characteristics, arteriovenous fistula-related characteristics, and endovascular procedures were analyzed. Technical and clinical results and patency rates were evaluated. The factors influencing patency were analyzed using a univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazards model. RESULTS Technical and clinical success rates were 93% (68/73) and 85% (62/73), respectively. At 3, 6, and 12 months, the primary patency rates were 87.9%, 73.3%, and 64.8%; assisted primary patency rates were 89.2%, 78.6%, and 70.7%; and secondary patency rates were 90.8%, 87.2%, and 83.1%, respectively. Previous intervention and cephalic arch stenosis were risk factors for lower primary and assisted primary patency ( p < 0.05 for all). Cephalic arch stenosis was the only risk factor for lower secondary patency ( p < 0.05). No major complications associated with the procedures were noticed. CONCLUSION Endovascular treatment was effective for the immediate recanalization of thrombosed arteriovenous fistula. In addition, previous intervention and cephalic arch stenosis were significantly related to lower arteriovenous fistula patency.","So, Young Ho; Choi, Young Ho; Oh, Sohee; Jung, In Mok; Chung, Jung Kee; Lucatelli, Pierleone",The journal of vascular access,https://doi.org/10.1177/1129729819848931; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31094648/,344
148909,Advice P.R.N.,2015,"INTRODUCTION To improve therapeutic decision making, it is crucial that information regarding adverse drug reactions reaches patients. It is not enough to disseminate such findings through regulatory and scientific channels; targeted efforts to reach patients are necessary. One possible avenue is to collaborate with patient organizations. OBJECTIVES The aim of this pilot study was to explore how adverse drug reactions can be communicated through patient organizations. METHODS A text describing a signal of levothyroxine and panic attacks was tailored to patients' needs, in terms of language, style and content, with emphasis placed on what to do when experiencing the symptoms described. The signal was communicated via the Dutch thyroid organization's digital newsletter, social media channels, website and print magazine. RESULTS The digital newsletter was distributed to around 5000 subscribers. On Facebook, 13,820 people viewed the message, with 2346 clicks in the message, indicating an intention to read the whole post. The interactions on social media were positive, and the tone was respectful. CONCLUSION Patient organizations can help enable effective communication of adverse drug reactions to a relevant audience. The social media post generated more engagement than other communications from the patient organization, indicating a strong interest in this information. The additional patient experiences that were shared in the comments on social media further strengthened the original signal and its relevance to patients, creating an interesting feedback loop. The favourable experiences in this study support further consideration and exploration of this approach to communicate adverse drug reactions to patients.","Härmark, Linda; Weits, Gerda; Meijer, Rietje; Santoro, Federica; Norén, G Niklas; van Hunsel, Florence",Drug safety,https://doi.org/10.1007/s40264-020-00932-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32418193/,344

The current cross-sectional study characterized relationships between neighborhood deprivation and perceived changes in pain-related experiences during the COVID-19 pandemic (early-September to mid-October 2020) for adult patients (N = 97) with nonspecific chronic low back pain. METHODS We collected self-report perceived experiences from participants enrolled in an ongoing pragmatic randomized trial across medical centers within the Salt Lake City, Utah and Baltimore, Maryland metropolitans. The Area Deprivation Index (composite of 17 U.S. Census deprivation metrics) reflected neighborhood deprivation based on participants' zip codes. RESULTS Although those living in the neighborhoods with greater deprivation endorsed significantly poorer physical (pain severity, pain interference, physical functioning), mental (depression, anxiety), and social health during the pandemic, there were no significant differences for perceived changes in pain-related experiences (pain severity, pain interference, sleep quality) between levels of neighborhood deprivation since the onset of the pandemic. However, those in neighborhoods with greater deprivation endorsed disproportionately worse perceived changes in pain coping, social support, and mood since the pandemic. CONCLUSIONS The current findings offer evidence that changes in pain coping during the pandemic may be disproportionately worse for those living in deprived areas. Considering poorer pain coping may contribute to long-term consequences, the current findings suggest the need for further attention and intervention to reduce the negative affect of the pandemic for such vulnerable populations.","Rassu, Fenan S; McFadden, Molly; Aaron, Rachel V; Wegener, Stephen T; Ephraim, Patti L; Lane, Elizabeth; Brennan, Gerard; Minick, Kate I; Fritz, Julie M; Skolasky, Richard L",Pain medicine,https://doi.org/10.1093/pm/pnab179; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34181008/,344

As of March 30, 2020, there have been 693,224 reported patients with COVID-19 worldwide, with 1,446 in Japan. Currently, although aspects of the route of transmission are unclear, infection by contact and by inhaling droplets is considered to be the dominant transmission route. Inflammatory symptoms in the upper respiratory tract persist for several days to 1 week after onset, and in some patients symptoms of pneumonia worsen and become severe. The presence of underlying diseases and advanced age are risk factors for increased severity. Diagnosis is based on detection of SARS-CoV-2 by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing of nasopharyngeal swabs or sputum. Symptomatic management is the main treatment for this disease. Although the efficacy of several agents is currently being tested, at present there is no effective therapeutic agent. To prevent infection, in addition to standard preventive measures, measures that counteract infection by contact and droplet inhalation are important. In addition, if procedures that cause aerosolization of virus are used, then measures that prevent airborne infection should be implemented.","Kutsuna, Satoshi",Uirusu,https://doi.org/10.2222/jsv.70.37; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33967111/,344
152373,SpeakingFaces: A Large-Scale Multimodal Dataset of Voice Commands with Visual and Thermal Video Streams.,2021-05-16,"OBJECTIVE Angioplasty and stenting are options for revascularization of symptomatic femoral popliteal disease. Although angioplasty alone is effective in short lesions, longer lesions are often treated with stents. Multiple overlapping stents are expensive and may be associated with stent fracture. This trial evaluated the safety and efficacy of a single self-expanding stent up to 20 cm in length in patients with atherosclerotic disease of the superficial femoral artery (SFA) and proximal popliteal artery. METHODS Patients with lesions >4 cm and <18 cm were enrolled in this nonrandomized, prospective, multicenter trial that evaluated the Protégé EverFlex Self-Expanding Peripheral Stent System (Covidien, Plymouth, Minn). The study's primary end points were the 30-day major adverse event rate and duplex ultrasound-assessed patency at 1 year. These were compared with published performance goals. A preplanned analysis was conducted for the primary effectiveness end points at 1 year. Follow-up, including history, ankle-brachial index, patient-reported outcomes, duplex ultrasound assessment, and radiographs, is planned through 3 years. There was core laboratory review of angiograms, ultrasound scans, and plain radiographs. A subgroup of patients was studied with graded treadmill testing. RESULTS The study enrolled 287 patients (66% male; mean age, 68 years) with stenotic, restenotic, or occluded lesions of the SFA at 44 investigational sites in the United States and Europe. Systemic comorbidities included hypertension (88%), hyperlipidemia (86%), diabetes (43%), and prior SFA intervention (41%). The mean lesion length measured by the core laboratory was 89 mm. The mean normal-to-normal lesion length measured by sites was 110 mm. A total of 303 stents were implanted, and 95% of patients received a single stent. No major adverse events occurred at 30 days. At 1 year, primary outcome of duplex ultrasound stent patency was 67.7% in evaluable patients, and among 1-year secondary outcomes, the mean ankle-brachial index increased by 0.25. Walking Improvement Questionnaire scores improved in pain by 33.7, distance by 37.1, speed by 18.6, and stair climbing by 24.7. The Kaplan-Meier estimate of primary patency was 77.2%, primary assisted patency was 86.9%, and secondary patency was 87.3%. Rutherford clinical category improved in 83.5% of patients. Stent fracture rate was 0.4%. Matched absolute claudication distance was 412 feet greater and was not statistically different in this subgroup of 29 individuals.

Introduction: The purpose of the study is to evaluate satisfaction associated with telemedicine and to determine how telemedicine is used by orthopedic surgeons in response to social distancing efforts necessitated by the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: We developed a survey to evaluate surgeon's perception of telemedicine during the COVID-19 pandemic. The survey consisted of four major sections focusing on (1) surgeon characteristics and current use of telemedicine, (2) telemedicine for new patients, (3) telemedicine for routine follow-up patients, and (4) telemedicine for postoperative patients. Results: We collected 268 survey responses. Overall, 84.8% of surgeons were using telemedicine, but only 20.5% of surgeons were using it before the COVID-19 pandemic. The overall satisfaction with telemedicine was 70.3% ± 20.9%. Of those who use telemedicine, 75% currently use it for new patients, 86.6% currently use it for routine follow-up patients, and 80.8% currently use it for postoperative patients (p = 0.01). Surgeons had higher satisfaction with building rapport and performing physical examination maneuvers for either routine follow-up or postoperative patients than for new patients (p < 0.0001 for both). However, satisfaction with obtaining imaging did not differ among the cohorts (p = 0.36). Surgeons felt they are more likely to continue to use telemedicine after the COVID-19 pandemic for either routine follow-up or postoperative patients than for new patients (p < 0.0001). Discussion: Owing to challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, telemedicine use has increased substantially among orthopedic surgeons in recent months. Conclusions: Our study established that physician implementation of telemedicine has increased significantly as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, with the majority of surgeons satisfied with its use in their practice, and plan on incorporating telemedicine in their practices beyond the pandemic.","Hurley, Eoghan T; Haskel, Jonathan D; Bloom, David A; Gonzalez-Lomas, Guillem; Jazrawi, Laith M; Bosco, Joseph A; Campbell, Kirk A",Telemedicine journal and e-health : the official journal of the American Telemedicine Association,https://doi.org/10.1089/tmj.2020.0255; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32931363/,344

Until now, the diagnosis of PJI is still confronted with technical limitations, and the question of whether synovial fluid biomarker, C-reactive protein (CRP), can provide high value in the diagnosis of PJI remains unanswered and, therefore, was the aim of the study. METHODS First, we conducted a systematic review on CRP in the diagnosis of PJI by searching online databases using keywords such as ""periprosthetic joint infection"", ""synovial fluid"", and ""C-reactive protein"". Eligible studies providing sufficient data to construct 2 × 2 contingency tables were then selected based on the list of criteria and the quality of included studies was assessed subsequently. Finally, the reported sensitivity, specificity, diagnostic odds ratio (DOR), summary receiver operating characteristic (SROC) curve, and the area under the SROC (AUSROC) were pooled together and used to evaluate overall diagnostic performance. RESULTS Seven studies were included in our review, six of which comprising a total of 456 participants were further investigated in our meta-analysis. The pooled sensitivity, specificity, and DOR were 0.92 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.86-0.96), 0.90 (95% CI: 0.87-0.93), and 101.40 (95% CI: 48.07-213.93), respectively. The AUSROC was 0.9663 (standard error, 0.0113).

153779,Animal researchers shoulder a psychological burden that animal ethics committees ought to address.,2021-03-31,"Scavenger receptors constitute a large family of proteins that are structurally diverse and participate in a wide range of biological functions. These receptors are expressed predominantly by myeloid cells and recognize a diverse variety of ligands including endogenous and modified host-derived molecules and microbial pathogens. There are currently eight classes of scavenger receptors, many of which have multiple names, leading to inconsistencies and confusion in the literature. To address this problem, a workshop was organized by the United States National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, to help develop a clear definition of scavenger receptors and a standardized nomenclature based on that definition. Fifteen experts in the scavenger receptor field attended the workshop and, after extensive discussion, reached a consensus regarding the definition of scavenger receptors and a proposed scavenger receptor nomenclature. Scavenger receptors were defined as cell surface receptors that typically bind multiple ligands and promote the removal of nonself or altered-self targets. They often function by mechanisms that include endocytosis, phagocytosis, adhesion, and signaling that ultimately lead to the elimination of degraded or harmful substances. Based on this definition, nomenclature and classification of these receptors into 10 classes were proposed. This classification was discussed at three national meetings and input from participants at these meetings was requested. The following manuscript is a consensus statement that combines the recommendations of the initial workshop and incorporates the input received from the participants at the three national meetings.","PrabhuDas, Mercy R; Baldwin, Cynthia L; Bollyky, Paul L; Bowdish, Dawn M E; Drickamer, Kurt; Febbraio, Maria; Herz, Joachim; Kobzik, Lester; Krieger, Monty; Loike, John; McVicker, Benita; Means, Terry K; Moestrup, Soren K; Post, Steven R; Sawamura, Tatsuya; Silverstein, Samuel; Speth, Robert C; Telfer, Janice C; Thiele, Geoffrey M; Wang, Xiang-Yang; Wright, Samuel D; El Khoury, Joseph",Journal of immunology,https://doi.org/10.4049/jimmunol.1700373; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28483986/,344

METHODS Of 656 patients enrolled in Interventional Management of Stroke III trial, 306 had baseline computed tomographic angiography. Of these, 185 patients had M1 middle cerebral artery ± intracranial internal carotid artery occlusion, where baseline collateral status could be measured. Collateral status was assessed by consensus using 3 different ordinal scales and categorized as good, intermediate, and poor. Multivariable modeling was used to assess the effect of collateral status and treatment type on clinical outcome by modified Rankin Scale (mRS 0-2, mRS 0-1, and the ordinal mRS). RESULTS Of 185 patients, 126 randomized to endovascular therapy (87.6% recanalized, 41.3% 90-day mRS 0-2) and 59 to intravenous tissue-type plasminogen activator only (60.5% recanalized, 30.5% 90-day mRS 0-2). In multivariable modeling, collateral status was a significant predictor of all clinical outcomes (P<0.05). Maximal benefit with endovascular treatment across all clinical outcomes was seen in patients with intermediate collaterals, some benefit in patients with good collaterals, and none in patients with poor collaterals, although small sample size limited the power of the analysis to show a statistically significant interaction between collateral status and treatment type (P>0.05). CONCLUSION Using data from a large randomized controlled trial (IMS III), we show that baseline computed tomographic angiography collaterals are a robust determinant of final clinical outcome and could be used to select patients for endovascular therapy.

155383,Truth and transparency in a time of crisis.,2020-03-17,"Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic demyelinating disorder of unknown etiology, possibly caused by a virus or virus-triggered immunopathology. The virus might reactivate after years of latency and lyse oligodendrocytes, as in progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, or initiate immunopathological demyelination, as in animals infected with Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus or coronaviruses. The argument for a viral cause of MS is supported by epidemiological analyses and studies of MS in identical twins, indicating that disease is acquired. However, the most important evidence is the presence of bands of oligoclonal IgG (OCBs) in MS brain and CSF that persist throughout the lifetime of the patient. OCBs are found almost exclusively in infectious CNS disorders, and antigenic targets of OCBs represent the agent that causes disease. Here, the authors review past attempts to identify an infectious agent in MS brain cells and discuss the promise of using recombinant antibodies generated from clonally expanded plasma cells in brain and CSF to identify disease-relevant antigens. They show how this strategy has been used successfully to analyze antigen specificity in subacute sclerosing panencephalitis, a chronic encephalitis caused by measles virus, and in neuromyelitis optica, a chronic autoimmune demyelinating disease produced by antibodies directed against the aquaporin-4 water channel.","Owens, Gregory P; Gilden, Don; Burgoon, Mark P; Yu, Xiaoli; Bennett, Jeffrey L","The Neuroscientist : a review journal bringing neurobiology, neurology and psychiatry",https://doi.org/10.1177/1073858411386615; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22130640/,344

The aim was to evaluate its performance during laparoscopic cholecystectomy. METHODS Patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy were randomized into ""active (device on)"" or ""control (device off)."" Three operating surgeons scored the percentage effective visibility and three reviewers scored the percentage of the procedure where smoke was present. All assessors also used a 5-point scale (1 = imperceptible/excellent and 5 = very annoying/bad) to rate visual impairment. Secondary outcomes were the number of smoke-related pauses, camera cleaning, and pneumoperitoneum reductions. Mean results are presented with 95% confidence intervals (CI). RESULTS In 30 patients (active 13, control 17), the effective visibility was 89.2% (83.3-95.0) for active cases and 71.2% (65.7-76.7) for controls. The proportion of the procedure where smoke was present was 41.1% (33.8-48.3) for active cases and 61.5% (49.0-74.1) for controls. Operating surgeons rated the visual impairment as 2.2 (1.7-2.6) for active cases and 3.2 (2.8-3.5) for controls. Reviewers rated the visual impairment as 2.3 (2.0-2.5) for active cases and 3.2 (2.8-3.7) for controls. In the active group, 23% of procedures were paused to allow smoke clearance compared to 94% of control cases. Camera cleaning was not needed in 85% of active procedures and 35% of controls. The pneumoperitoneum was reduced in 0% of active cases and 88% of controls. CONCLUSIONS Ultravision™ improves visibility during laparoscopic surgery and reduces delays in surgery for smoke clearance and camera cleaning.","Ansell, James; Warren, Neil; Wall, Pete; Cocks, Kim; Goddard, Stuart; Whiston, Richard; Stechman, Michael; Scott-Coombes, David; Torkington, Jared",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-014-3427-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24570011/,344

Protein promiscuity has two broadly different types of footprint in drug design. The first is relaxed specificity of binding sites for substrates, inhibitors, effectors or cofactors. The second involves protein-protein interactions of regulatory processes such as signal transduction and transcription, and here protein intrinsic disorder plays an important role. Both viruses and host cells exploit intrinsic disorder for their survival, as do the design and discovery programs for antivirals. Drug action, strictly speaking, always relies upon promiscuous activity, with drug promiscuity enlarging its scope.

Long-term impairments may be affected by supplemental oxygen, a common treatment in ICU, having both potential beneficial and harmful long-lasting effects. This systematic review aims to assess the long-term outcomes of lower versus higher oxygen supplementation and/or oxygenation levels in adults admitted to ICU. METHODS We will include trials differentiating between a lower and a higher oxygen supplementation or a lower and a higher oxygenation strategy in adults admitted to the ICU. We will search major electronic databases and trial registers for randomised clinical trials. Two authors will independently screen and select references for inclusion using Covidence and predefined data will be extracted. The methodological quality and risk of bias of included trials will be evaluated using the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool 2. Meta-analysis will be performed if two or more trials with comparable outcome measures will be included. Otherwise, a narrative description of the trials' results will be presented instead. To assess the certainty of evidence, we will create a ""Summary of findings"" table containing all prespecified outcomes using the GRADE system. The protocol is submitted on the PROSPERO database (ID 223630). CONCLUSION No systematic reviews on the impact of oxygen treatment in the ICU on long-term outcomes, other than mortality and quality of life, have been reported yet. This systematic review will provide an overview of the current evidence and will help future research in the field.","Crescioli, Elena; Krejberg, Kirsten Uldal; Klitgaard, Thomas Lass; Mølgaard Nielsen, Frederik; Barbateskovic, Marija; Skrubbeltrang, Conni; Møller, Morten Hylander; Schjørring, Olav Lilleholt; Rasmussen, Bodil Steen",Acta anaesthesiologica Scandinavica,https://doi.org/10.1111/aas.13984; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34570915/,344
158394,Thousands of people will help scientists to track the long-term health effects of the coronavirus crisis.,2020-06-02,"INTRODUCTION Magnet-assisted surgery is a new platform within minimally invasive surgery. The Levita™ Magnetic Surgical System, the first magnetic surgical system to receive Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval, includes a deployable, magnetic grasper and an external magnet that is used to manipulate the grasper within the peritoneal cavity. This system is currently approved for patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy with a body mass index (BMI) between 21 and 34 kg/m2. Herein, we detail the first United States experience with the Levita™ Magnetic Surgical System during laparoscopic cholecystectomy. METHODS The Levita™ Magnetic Surgical System was used on consecutive patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy at our institution from June 2016 through November 2016. Only patients undergoing elective surgery and those with a body mass index (BMI) between 21 and 34 kg/m2 were included. Baseline patient characteristics, operative time, and perioperative details were collected. RESULTS A total of ten patients underwent laparoscopic cholecystectomy with the Levita™ Magnetic Surgical System during the defined study period. The mean age at the time of surgery was 49.0 years and the average BMI of the cohort was 27.6 kg/m2. The average operative time was 64.4 min. There were no perioperative complications. Seven (70.0%) patients were discharged to home on the day of surgery, while the remaining three (30.0%) patients were discharged to home on postoperative day number one. Surgeons reported that the magnetic grasper was easy to use and provided adequate tissue retraction and exposure. CONCLUSIONS The Levita™ Magnetic Surgical System is safe and feasible to use in patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Routine use of this system may facilitate a reduction in the total number of laparoscopic trocars used, leading to less tissue trauma and improved cosmesis. Additional studies are needed to determine the applicability and utility of this system for other general surgery cases.","Haskins, Ivy N; Strong, Andrew T; Allemang, Matthew T; Bencsath, Kalman P; Rodriguez, John H; Kroh, Matthew D",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-017-5762-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28733750/,344

Fifty adult patients who were scheduled for elective rhinoplasty surgery and required controlled hypotension were enrolled in this prospective study. Controlled hypotension was provided using a combination of propofol and remifentanil infusion supplemented with nitroglycerin infusion as necessary. rSO2 was evaluated during controlled hypotension by NIRS. Cerebral desaturation was observed in 5 out of 50 patients (10 %) during hypotensive anesthesia. The greatest decrease from baseline was 28 % when MAP was 57 mmHg. In both non-desaturated and desaturated patients, postoperative MMSE scores were significantly lower than preoperative scores. There was a 4 % decrease in the non-desaturated patients and a 7 % decrease in the desaturated patients when preoperative and postoperative MMSE scores were compared. A decline in cognitive function 1 day after surgery was observed in 23 patients (46 %) and in all patients with intraoperative cerebral desaturation. The current study showed that even if SpO2 is in the normal range, there might be a decrease of more than 20 % in cerebral oxygen saturation during controlled hypotension.","Erdem, Ali Fuat; Kayabasoglu, Gurkan; Tas Tuna, Ayca; Palabiyik, Onur; Tomak, Yakup; Beyaz, Serbulent Gokhan",Journal of clinical monitoring and computing,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10877-015-9768-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26358703/,344

We follow a theoretical paradigm used successfully for gas phase reactions, where electronic structure theory (DFT-GGA) is combined with transition state theory (TST). Classical ab initio molecular dynamics trajectories initiated from a thermal distribution near the transition state provide dynamical corrections to the desorption rate. We use this to calculate and study the recrossing error of TST and to directly simulate thermal desorption experiments based on a high temperature permeation method. Transition state recrossing is strongly temperature dependent and is even important in a frozen Cu-atom model. It is not influenced by inclusion of electron-hole pair excitation at the level of the local density electronic friction approximation. We also present the kinetic energy resolved flux of desorbing H2 at elevated temperature. This provides a more direct way to compare first principles theory to experiment, with no need to invoke detailed balance.","Galparsoro, Oihana; Kaufmann, Sven; Auerbach, Daniel J; Kandratsenka, Alexander; Wodtke, Alec M",Physical chemistry chemical physics : PCCP,https://doi.org/10.1039/d0cp02858d; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32734979/,344

We focused on hyperglycemia, a main feature of diabetes mellitus, and uncovered its effect on precancerous pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PanIN) progression. In vivo induction of hyperglycemia with 100 mg/kg streptozotocin in KrasLSL G12D Pdx1Cre (KP) mice promoted the PanIN formation and progression. Preconditioning with a high- or low-glucose medium for 28 days showed that a high-glucose environment increased cell viability and sphere formation in PANC-1, a Kras-mutant human pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma cell line, and mPKC1, a Kras-mutant murine pancreatic cancer cell line. In contrast, no changes were observed in BxPC3, a Kras-wild-type human pancreatic cancer cell line. Orthotopic injection of mPKC1 into the pancreatic tails of BL6/J mice showed that cells maintained in high-glucose medium grew into larger tumors than did those maintained in low-glucose medium. Hyperglycemia strengthened the STAT3 phosphorylation, which was accompanied by elevated MYC expression in Kras-mutant cells. Immunohistochemistry showed stronger phosphorylated STAT3 (pSTAT3) and MYC staining in PanINs from diabetic KP mice than in those from euglycemic counterparts. STAT3 inhibition with 1 μM STAT3 inhibitor STATTIC in Kras-mutant pancreatic cell lines blocked the cell viability- and sphere formation-enhancing effects of the hyperglycemic environment and reversed the elevated pSTAT3 and MYC expression. MYC knockdown did not affect cell viability but did reduce sphere formation. No decrease in pSTAT3 expression was observed upon siMYC treatment. In conclusion, hyperglycemia, on a Kras-mutant background, aggravates the PanIN progression, which is accompanied by elevated pSTAT3 and MYC expression.","Sato, Katsuhiko; Hikita, Hayato; Myojin, Yuta; Fukumoto, Kenji; Murai, Kazuhiro; Sakane, Sadatsugu; Tamura, Takeshi; Yamai, Takuo; Nozaki, Yasutoshi; Yoshioka, Teppei; Kodama, Takahiro; Shigekawa, Minoru; Sakamori, Ryotaro; Tatsumi, Tomohide; Takehara, Tetsuo",PloS one,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0235573; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32609742/,344

We aimed to describe our National E learning education model for urology residents. METHODOLOGY The ERTP working group; consisting of urologists was established by Society of Urological Surgery to create E-learning model and curriculum at April 2018. Learning objectives were set up in order to determine and standardize the contents of the presentations. In accordance with the Bloom Taxonomy, 834 learning objectives were created for a total of 90 lectures (18 lectures for each PGY year). Totally 90 videos were shoot by specialized instructors and webcasts were prepared. Webcasts were posted at uropedia.com.tr, which is the web library of Society of Urological Surgery. Satisfaction of residents and instructors was evaluated with feedbacks. An assessment of knowledge was measured with multiple-choice exam. RESULTS A total of 43 centers and 250 urology residents were included in ERTP during the academic year 2018/2019. There were 93/38/43/34/25 urology residents at 1st /2nd /3rd /4th and 5th year of residency, respectively. Majority of the residents (99.1%) completed the ERTP. The overall satisfaction rate of residents and instructors were 4,29 and 4,67(min:1 so bad, max:5 so good). An assessment exam was performed to urology residents at the end of the ERTP and the mean score was calculated as 57.99 points (min:20, max:82). CONCLUSION Due to the Covid-19 pandemic, most of the educational programs had to move online platforms. We used this reliable and easily accessible e-learning platform for standardization of training in urology on national basis. We aim to share this model with international residency training programs.","Sen, Volkan; Eren, Huseyin; Kazaz, Ilke Onur; Goger, Yunus Emre; Izol, Volkan; Tarhan, Huseyin; Argun, Burak; Akbal, Cem; Mungan, Aydin; Esen, Ahmet Adil",International journal of clinical practice,https://doi.org/10.1111/ijcp.13683; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32810325/,344

This SNP is a marker for skin pigmentation. LightCycler-based probes (HybProbes) were designed. A LightCycler (version 2.0) system was used for the real-time PCR. Results The results of the real-time PCRs of three different genotypes of SNP rs1545397 were compared with those of the direct sequencing. Melting curve analysis was used for genotype determination. Three genotypes were distinguished: the homozygous T (T/T) SNP type formed a distinct melting peak at 53.3 ± 0.14°C, the homozygous A (A/A) SNP type formed a distinct melting peak at 57.8 ± 0.12°C, and the heterozygous A/T SNP type formed two distinct melting peaks at 53.3 ± 0.17°C and 57.8 ± 0.15°C. Mongolian aDNA samples tested in this study carried all three types of the SNP (A/T, A/A, and T/T) with no distinctly predominant type observed. In contrast, Korean aDNA samples carried the Asian genotype (T/T), while the Uzbekistan aDNA samples carried the European genotype (A/A) more often than the Asian genotype (T/T). Conclusions Human Mongolian aDNA samples had A/T, A/A, and T/T SNP rs1545397 with no distinct predominant genotype. When combined with the archeological and aDNA studies of other coupling morphologies with aDNA, our results infer that Mongolia's prehistoric population had considerable heterogeneity of skin color and morphological traits and that in the Neolithic period, a Eurasian or mixed population inhabited the western part of Mongolia.","Bazarragchaa, Munkhtsetseg; Uuganbayar, Udval; Lee, Kwang-Ho; Kim, Kyung-Yong; Kim, Kijeong",BioMed research international,https://doi.org/10.1155/2020/2585324; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33083459/,344

Numerous reports over the past year have described the clinical and immunological profiles of COVID-19 patients, and while some trends have emerged for risk stratification, they do not provide a complete picture. Therefore, efforts are ongoing to identify genetic susceptibility factors of severe disease. In this issue of the JCI, Povysil et al. performed a large, multi-country study, sequencing genomes from patients with mild and severe COVID-19, along with population controls. Contrary to previous reports, the authors observed no enrichment of predicted loss-of-function variants in genes in the type I interferon pathway, which might predispose to severe disease. These studies suggest that more evidence is needed to substantiate the hypothesis for a genetic immune predisposition to severe COVID-19, and highlights the importance of considering experimental design when implicating a monogenic basis for severe disease.","Cotsapas, Chris; Saarela, Janna; Farmer, Jocelyn R; Scaria, Vinod; Abraham, Roshini S",The Journal of clinical investigation,https://doi.org/10.1172/jci149459; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34061775/,344
161982,An ethical framework for global vaccine allocation.,2020-09-03,"BACKGROUND Transanal total mesorectal excision (TaTME) is a safe alternative to laparoscopic TME for mid and low rectal cancer. TaTME allows improved visualization of the surgical planes and margins, and may potentially improve oncological outcomes. However, functional results after total mesorectal excision (TME) are variable and there are currently only a few published studies that include functional data related to the outcomes of TaTME. METHODS Fifty-four consecutive patients were included in this study: one group included 27 patients who underwent laparoscopic low anterior and the other included 27 patients who underwent TaTME. All patients were asked to complete five questionnaires related to quality of life (QOL) and function [EQ-5D-3L, EORTC-QLQ C30, EORTC-QLQ C29, Low Anterior Resection Syndrome score (LARS), and International Prostate Symptom Score IPSS]. All TaTME patients were operated on at The Gelderse Vallei Hospital by a single surgeon and had a follow-up of at least 6.6 months. RESULTS The EORTC-QLQ C30 and EQ-5D-3L questionnaires showed comparable outcomes in terms of QOL between the two groups. Almost all items evaluated by the EORTC-QLQ C29, including sexual outcomes, were similar between the two groups. One item concerning fecal incontinence, however, was scored worse for TaTME. There were no significant differences between the groups in terms of LARS symptoms or urinary function. CONCLUSIONS Patients undergoing laparoscopic or transanal TME showed comparable functional and QOL outcomes. Although the TaTME technique is still evolving, this study indicates that this technique is a safe alternative to laparoscopic surgery in terms of functional outcomes for mid and low rectal cancers.","Veltcamp Helbach, Marloes; Koedam, Thomas W A; Knol, Joep J; Velthuis, Simone; Bonjer, H Jaap; Tuynman, Jurriaan B; Sietses, Colin",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-018-6276-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29967994/,344

Hypothalamic agouti-related peptide (AgRP)-expressing neurons are acutely activated by caloric need, and this acute activation promotes increased food intake and decreased energy expenditure. On a longer timescale, AgRP neurons exhibit chronic hyperactivity under conditions of obesity and high dietary fat consumption, likely due to leptin resistance; however, the behavioral and metabolic effects of chronic AgRP neuronal hyperactivity remain unexplored. Here, we use chemogenetics to manipulate Gq signaling in AgRP neurons in mice to explore the hypothesis that chronic activation of AgRP neurons promotes obesity. Inducing chronic Gq signaling in AgRP neurons initially increased food intake and caused dramatic weight gain, in agreement with published data; however, food intake returned to baseline levels within 1 wk, and body weight returned to baseline levels within 60 d. Additionally, we found that, when mice had elevated body weight due to chronic Gq signaling in AgRP neurons, energy expenditure was not altered but adiposity and lipid metabolism were both increased, even under caloric restriction. These findings reveal that the metabolic and behavioral effects of chronic Gq signaling in AgRP neurons are distinct from the previously reported effects of acute Gq signaling and also of leptin insensitivity.","Ewbank, Sedona N; Campos, Carlos A; Chen, Jane Y; Bowen, Anna J; Padilla, Stephanie L; Dempsey, Joseph L; Cui, Julia Yue; Palmiter, Richard D",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2004941117; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32764144/,344
162368,Designing a suitable stability protocol in the face of a changing retail landscape,2021,"PURPOSE Single-incision laparoscopic surgery was developed recently and has the benefit of reducing the number of incisions. Its application in colectomy has been published only in case reports. The present study evaluated our early results of single-incision laproscopic surgery in a series of 8 patients who underwent colectomy for various colorectal pathologies. METHODS Eight patients underwent single-incision laparoscopic colectomy for cancer (n = 5), polyps (n = 2), and diverticulitis (n = 1) during the study period. The data on the operations and outcomes were collected prospectively and analyzed. RESULTS The median age of the patients was 78 years (range, 49-88). The operations were right colectomy (n = 6), left colectomy (n = 1), and anterior resection (n = 1). The median operating time was 175 minutes (range, 103-260) and the median blood loss was 55 mL (range, 20-200). The average length of the incision was 3.4 cm (range, 3.0-5.0). One patient required conversion to hand-assisted laparoscopy with a 5-cm incision. The median hospital stay was 3.5 days (range, 3-6) and 1 patient had ileus after the operation. There was no mortality and no reintervention within 30 days. In patients with cancer, all of the resection margins were clear. The median number of lymph nodes examined was 13.5 (range, 9-36). CONCLUSIONS Single-incision laparoscopic surgery can be applied to colectomy safely. Oncologic resection similar to conventional laparoscopy can be performed with this technique. Further studies are needed to evaluate the outcomes against those of conventional laparoscopic resection.","Law, Wai-Lun; Fan, Joe K M; Poon, Jensen T C",Diseases of the colon and rectum,https://doi.org/10.1007/dcr.0b013e3181c959ba; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20173474/,344

Surveying the design, security and market perspectives",2021-06-29,"OBJECTIVES We present our single center results of two commonly used surgical techniques, the modified single-patch and double-patch technique for the repair of the complete atrioventricular septal defect. METHODS We enrolled 49 patients with complete atrioventricular septal defect who were operated by a single surgeon between 2004 and 2014. The modified single-patch technique was performed in 32 cases (group S), whereas the defect was repaired with the double-patch technique in 17 patients (group D). RESULTS The mean age at the time of operation was 7.7 ± 8.6 (range 1-48) months and 9.9 ± 12.5 (range 1.5-48) months, in groups S and D, respectively. Mean body weight was 6.7 ± 3 (range 3.5-15.5) kilograms and 7.2 ± 3.8 (range 4.3-14.5) kilograms in groups S and D, respectively. Cross-clamp and cardiopulmonary bypass times were shorter in the modified single-patch group (65.6 ± 16.3 vs. 98.7 ± 19.8 minutes, p = 0.0001; 88.9 ± 23.3 vs. 128.9 ± 28.0 minutes, p = 0.0001). Postoperative atrioventricular valve function was improved in both groups. Mean follow-up period was 4.4 ± 3.2 (range 1.2-9.9) years. One patient in each group underwent reoperation for left atrioventricular valve insufficiency. We encountered two early and one late mortalities in modified single-patch group. One early mortality was experienced in the unmodified group. CONCLUSIONS The modified single-patch and two-patch techniques have comparable results; however, the modified single-patch technique is performed with significantly shorter cross-clamp and cardiopulmonary bypass times, therefore we have adopted this technique on a routine basis for the treatment of the complete atrioventricular septal defect in our institute.","Yildirim, Ozgur; Avsar, Mustafa; Ozyuksel, Arda; Akdemir, Mehmet; Zeybek, Cenap; Demiroluk, Sener; Bilal, Mehmet Salih",Journal of cardiac surgery,https://doi.org/10.1111/jocs.12557; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25940208/,344

163068,Karl Marx and the Blockchain,2020-07-27,"Prisons are high-incidence settings for tuberculosis around the world, yet the contribution of spillover from prisons in driving community epidemics has not been quantified. We whole genome sequenced 1,152 M. tuberculosis isolates from participants diagnosed with tuberculosis within prisons and in the community in Mato Grosso do Sul, Brazil from 2014 to 2019. By integrating timed phylogenies and detailed location data, we reconstructed probabilistic transmission histories. M. tuberculosis sequences from incarcerated and non-incarcerated people were closely phylogenetically related. We found that 57% of recent community-wide tuberculosis cases were attributable to transmission from individuals with an incarceration history, 2.6% of the population. Further, we find genomic evidence that the prison system disseminates M. tuberculosis genotypes through frequent transfers across the state. This population-wide genomic transmission reconstruction framework can be applied to identify key environments amplifying infectious disease transmission to prioritize public health interventions.","Walter, K.

Several studies have shown that epidemics and related health measures (quarantine, confinement) lead to an increase of acute stress disorders (ASD), post-traumatic stress disorders (PTSD), anxiety and depression in the adult population [2]. In the pediatric population, few studies have been carried out on the psychiatric outcomes during and after epidemics and associated measures [3].ObjectivesThe aim of this study was to explore ASD symptoms during stay-at-home and Covid 19 pandemic and its impact on children and adolescent mental health.MethodsSixty participants (53% girls and 47% boys;mean age= 9 years 5 months) were included in this longitudinal study [4]. The measures consist in an emergency semi-directed interview designed to assess symptoms of ASD according to the age of children.ResultsPatients’ age modulated psychiatric outcomes. Children under the age of six shown more developmental regressions and more restlessness than older ones. Children from 6 to 12 years were characterized by more oppositional behaviors than adolescents. Finally, adolescents were characterized by more social isolation than younger ones. Other symptoms appear to be more stable across ages: sleep disturbance, fear behavior and somatization.ConclusionsYoung children experienced more externalized symptoms (opposition and agitation) and developmental regressions than older children [5]. Thus, it appears necessary during pandemic to take into account the psychiatric consequences of confinement to reduce psychosocial long-term outcomes in particular in younger patients who appeared to develop specific and age-related psychiatric disorders.","Gindt, M.; Fernandez, A.; Battista, M.; Richez, A.; Nachon, O.; Askenazy, F.",European Psychiatry,https://doi.org/10.1192/j.eurpsy.2021.971,344

The presented quantitative study analyzed how secondary school teachers understand and actively use Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) in their teaching practice and what barriers they encounter in terms of the further education in ICT provided by accredited institutions. In a sample of 1846 Czech teachers who completed an online survey, results showed they lacked both understanding and active use of new technologies, rarely participated in further education, and were unsatisfied with the courses provided to them. Their main barriers to further education were the lack of sufficient technology available in school, insufficient knowledge and skills in ICT, and the lack of support from school management. Unlike in other studies, time was not identified as an important barrier. Possible legislative, educational, and school management consequences regarding the further education in ICT based on the barriers in attending the courses and identified age and gender differences are discussed.","Novotný, Lukáš",Sustainability,https://doi.org/10.3390/su13084106,344

The existing drugs are used only for symptomatic relief;among them chloroquine and its analogues have shown apparent and promising effectiveness in the treatment of COVID-19-related pneumonia. Due to unknown etiology of SARS-CoV-2, the mode of action of chloroquine and its derivatives has not been clear, but based on its different positive analysis results, on March 28, 2020, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) allowed chloroquine phosphate and hydroxychloroquine sulfate to treat hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Globally, various researchers are continuously working on these compounds to improve their efficacy and affinity to SAR-CoV-2 targets and also trying to design new chloroquine derivatives with better response. In the present time, computational modeling approaches (homology modeling, molecular docking, molecular dynamic simulation, quantitative structure-activity relationship or QSAR, pharmacophore, etc.) are being proved very helpful for the easy identification of novel inhibitors against different SARS-CoV-2 targets. Chloroquine and its analogues are being explored by various researchers for repurposing of these drugs against SARS-CoV-2 by implementing different computational methodologies. In this chapter, we have presented recently published reports on the in silico modeling of chloroquine analogues for the design and identification of novel drugs against SARS-CoV-2. The chapter also provides the reader with a general idea about a successful computational drug discovery research in this particular area of applications.","Kumar, V.; Roy, K.",Methods Pharmacol.

Similar to the Tapestry scheme of Ghosh et al., the proposed schemes leverage soft information from the RT-qPCR process about the total viral load in the pool. This is in contrast to conventional group testing schemes where the measurements are Boolean. The proposed schemes provide higher testing throughput than the popularly used Dorfman’s scheme. They also provide higher testing throughput, sensitivity and specificity than the state-of-the-art non-adaptive Tapestry scheme. The number of pipetting operations is lower than the Tapestry scheme, and is higher than that for the Dorfman’s scheme. The proposed schemes can work with substantially smaller group sizes than non-adaptive schemes and are simple to describe. Monte-Carlo simulations using the statistical model in the work of Ghosh et al. (Tapestry) show that 10 infected people in a population of size 961 can be identified with 70.86 tests on the average with a sensitivity of 99.50% and specificity of 99.62%.

164406,"When the (face)mask slips: Politics, performance and crisis in urban Brazil",2021,"The rapid evolution of RNA viruses has been long considered to result from a combination of high copying error frequencies during RNA replication, short generation times and the consequent extensive fixation of neutral or adaptive changes over short periods. While both the identities and sites of mutations are typically modelled as being random, recent investigations of sequence diversity of SARS coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) have identified a preponderance of C->U transitions, potentially driven by an APOBEC-like RNA editing process. The current study investigated whether this phenomenon could be observed in the more genetically diverse datasets of other RNA viruses. Using a 5% divergence filter to infer directionality, 18 from 32 datasets of aligned coding region sequences from a diverse range of mammalian RNA viruses (including Picornaviridae, Flaviviridae, Matonaviridae, Caliciviridae and Coronaviridae) showed a >2-fold base composition normalised excess of C->U transitions compared to U->C (range 2.1x–7.5x). C->U transitions showed a favoured 5’ U upstream context consistent with previous analyses of APOBEC-mediated RNA targeting. Amongst several genomic compositional and structural parameters, the presence of genome scale RNA secondary structure (GORS) was associated with C->U/U->C transition asymmetries (p < 0.001), potentially reflecting the documented structure dependence of APOBEC-mediated RNA editing. Using the association index metric, C->U changes were specifically over-represented at phylogenetically uninformative sites, consistent with extensive homoplasy documented in SARS-CoV-2. Excess C->U substitutions accounted for 15-20% of standing sequence variability of HCV and other RNA viruses; RNA editing may therefore represent a potent driver of RNA virus sequence diversification and longer term evolution. Author Summary The rapid evolution of RNA viruses is thought to arise from high mutation frequencies during replication and the rapid accumulation of genetic changes over time in response to its changing environments. This study describes an additional potent factor that contributes to the evolution of RNA infecting mammals, the deliberate mutation of the viral genome by host antiviral pathways active within the cell when it becomes infected. This so called “genome editing” by one or more APOBEC enzymes leads to characteristic C->U mutations that damage the virus’s ability to replicate. While this pathway is well characterised as an antiviral defence against HIV and other retroviruses, this study provides evidence for its activity against a wide range of human and veterinary viruses, including HCV and foot and mouth disease virus. APOBEC-driven mutations accounted for 15-20% of standing sequence variability of RNA virus groups, representing a potent driver of RNA virus sequence diversification.","Simmonds, Peter; Ansari, M.

164496,CHARACTERIZING AND MANAGING AN EPIDEMIC: A FIRST PRINCIPLES MODEL AND A CLOSED FORM SOLUTION TO THE KERMACK AND MCKENDRICK EQUATIONS,2021-09-14,"Introduction: The SARS-COV2 pandemic has transformed several aspects of our daily lives, we have already experienced profound changes in our society and behavior, and it was only possible to keep part of the gear of life functioning thanks to technology. But it is not possible to talk about technology without talking about digital transformation. The technology applied to medicine provides health professionals with greater access to information and tools that convey evidence-based medicine are essential. Among them we can mention databases such as Medline, PubMed, Embase, Cochrane and UpToDate platform. The COVID 19 pandemic has further accelerated this digital transformation process, instituting changes that are here to stay. Objectives: Today in Brazil, we have an average of 7,000 oncologists and 3,000 hematologists. We know that access to information in a foreign language, even English, is still a problem. The excess of information, and the difficulty of reading scientific publications critically, are another obstacle in medical education in a developing country. The objective of this project is to expand access to information, in continues medical education model, to improve public and private health in the area of hematology. Methods: The hematology team at Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein (HIAE), associated with the HIAE digital transformation laboratory, developed a healthtech platform, called hematolog.app, aiming to make available several updated technical content in different formats: podcasts, videos, discussion of clinical cases, analysis of scientific articles in the form of visual abstracts, reviews of relevant topics in text format. The initiative is supported by the most important national hematology Societies. Discussion: We know that healthtech platforms have transformed medical practice. An online survey of clinicians at the Massachusetts General Hospital and Brigham and Women's Hospital described the following effects among UpToDate users: 95% reported that UpToDate was integral for making decisions, 94% reported that they had changed diagnosis, 95% reported that UpToDate led to a change in patient management, 97% said UpToDate helps them provide the best care for their patients, 90% reported that UpToDate makes them a better doctor, 96% reported made them more comfortable with their decisions. PubMed makes it possible to identify references and summaries of articles from the Medline database, maintained by the National Library of Medicine. PubMed provides several tools to make the search more efficient, unknown to most doctors. Conclusion: The development of hematolog.app aims to create a digital platform that integrates specialists in the area, creating a continuous process of education, and integrating professionals in a developing country, seeking to standardize medical practice in different regions and health services in Brazil, creating an interconnected social network and practicing evidence-based medicine.

164676,Feasibility of Rainwater Harvesting and Consumption in a Middle Eastern Semiarid Urban Area,2021,"Voluntary control of sensorimotor rhythms (SMR, 8-12 Hz) can be used for brain-computer interface (BCI)-based operation of an assistive hand exoskeleton, e.g., in finger paralysis after stroke. To gain SMR control, stroke survivors are usually instructed to engage in motor imagery (MI) or to attempt moving the paralyzed fingers resulting in task- or event-related desynchronization (ERD) of SMR (SMR-ERD). However, as these tasks are cognitively demanding, especially for stroke survivors suffering from cognitive impairments, BCI control performance can deteriorate considerably over time. It would thus be important to identify biomarkers that predict decline in BCI control performance within an ongoing session in order to optimize the man-machine interaction scheme. Here we determine the link between BCI control performance over time and heart rate variability (HRV). Specifically, we investigated whether HRV can be used as a biomarker to predict decline during voluntary control of SMR-ERD across 17 healthy participants using Granger causality. SMR-ERD was visually displayed on a screen. Participants were instructed to engage in MI-based SMR-ERD control over two consecutive runs of 8.5 minutes each. During the second run, task difficulty was gradually increased. While control performance (p = .18) and HRV (p = .16) remained unchanged across participants during the first run, during the second run, both measures declined over time at high correlation (performance: -0.61%/10s, p = 0; HRV: -0.007ms/10s, p < .001). We found that HRV Granger-caused BCI control performance (p < .001) exhibited predictive characteristics of HRV on an individual participant level. These results suggest that HRV can predict decline in BCI performance paving the way for adaptive BCI control paradigms, e.g., to individualize and optimize assistive BCI systems in stroke.","Nann, Marius; Haslacher, David; Colucci, Annalisa; Eskofier, Bjoern; von Tscharner, Vinzenz; Soekadar, Surjo R.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.01.08.424840,344

Prior studies indicate that AT2s also express major histocompatibility complex II (MHCII) molecules, but how MHCII expression by AT2s is regulated and how it contributes to host defense remain unclear. Here we show that AT2s express high levels of MHCII independent of conventional inflammatory stimuli, and that selective loss of MHCII from AT2s in mice results in the worsening of respiratory virus disease following influenza and Sendai virus infections. We also find that AT2s exhibit MHCII presentation capacity that is substantially limited in comparison to professional antigen presenting cells. The combination of constitutive MHCII expression and restrained presentation may position AT2s to contribute to lung adaptive immune responses in a measured fashion, without over-amplifying damaging inflammation.","Toulmin, Sushila A.; Bhadiadra, Chaitali; Paris, Andrew J.; Lin, Jeffrey H.; Katzen, Jeremy; Basil, Maria C.; Morrisey, Edward E.; Worthen, G.

These impacts are less well understood in low-and middle-income countries, where mortality surveillance before the pandemic was patchy. Although limited all-cause mortality data are available in India, interpreting this data remains a challenge. Objective: We use existing data on all-cause mortality from civil registration systems of twelve Indian states comprising around 60% of the national population to understand the scale and timing of excess deaths in India during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: We characterize the available data, discuss the various reasons why these data are incomplete, and estimate the extent of coverage in the data. Comparing the pandemic period to 2019, we estimate excess mortality in twelve Indian states, and extrapolate our estimates to the rest of India. We explore sensitivity of the estimates to various assumptions, and present optimistic and pessimistic scenarios along with our central estimates. Results: For the 12 states with available all-cause mortality data, we document an increase of 28% in deaths during April 2020-May 2021 relative to expectations from 2019. This level of increase in mortality, if it applies nationally, would imply 2.8-2.9 million excess deaths. More limited data from June 2021 increases national estimates of excess deaths during April 2020-June 2021 to 3.8 million. With more optimistic or pessimistic assumptions, excess deaths during this period could credibly lie between 2.8 million and 5.2 million. We find that the scale of estimated excess deaths is broadly consistent with expectations based on seroprevalence data and international data on COVID-19 fatality rates. Moreover, there is a strong association between the timing of excess deaths, and of recorded COVID-19 deaths. Contribution: We show that the surveillance of pandemic mortality in India has been extremely poor, with around 8-10 times as many excess deaths as officially recorded COVID-19 deaths. Our findings highlight the utility of all-cause mortality data, as well as the significant challenges in interpreting such data from LMICs. These data reveal that India is among the countries most severely impacted by the pandemic. It is likely that in absolute terms India has seen the highest number of pandemic excess deaths of any country in the world.","Banaji, M.; Gupta, A.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.09.30.21264376v1?rss=1,344

165642,Moral Framing and Ideological Bias of News,2020-09-27,"The Ebola virus (EBOV) hijacks normal physiological processes by apoptotic mimicry in order to be taken up by the cell it infects. The initial adhesion of the virus to the cell is based on the interaction between T-cell immunoglobulin and mucin domain protein, TIM, on the cell-surface and phosphatidylserine (PS) on the viral outer surface. Therefore, it is important to understand the interaction between EBOV/PS and TIM, with selective blocking of the interaction as a potential therapy. Recent experimental studies have shown that for TIM-dependent EBOV entry, a Mucin-like Domain (MLD) with a length of at least 120 amino acids is required, possibly due to the increase of area of the PS-coated surface sampled. We examine this hypothesis by modeling the process of TIM-PS adhesion using a coarse-grained molecular model. We find that the strength of bound PS−TIM pairs is essentially independent of TIM length. TIMs with longer MLDs have higher average binding strengths because of an increase in the probability of binding between EBOV and TIM proteins. Similarly, we find that for larger persistence length (less flexible) the average binding force decreases, again because of a reduction in the probability of binding. Statement of Significance This work studies the mechanism of TIM-dependent adhesion of the Ebola virus to a cell. Through coarse grained modeling we show that longer TIM stalks adhere more easily as they can sample a larger area, thus offering a mechanistic interpretation of an experimental finding. Better mechanistic understanding can lead to therapeutic ideas for blocking adhesion.","Cui, X.; Lapinski, N.; Zhang, X.; Jagota, A.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.07.02.184580,344

However, these devices do not record short lasting AF episodes (&lt;30-120 seconds [s]). In addition, the incidence and type of other clinically relevant arrhythmias is poorly understood in this clinical setting. PURPOSE To evaluate the incidence, type and clinical relevance of arrhythmias detected by one-month continuous ECG monitoring in patients after cryptogenic stroke. MATERIAL AND METHODS Consecutive patients (p) with stroke and no previous AF or other cardioembolic or atheroembolic causes were prospectively enrolled in the study. An external wearable 2-lead ECG monitoring system (NUUBO) was used for 30 days (d) in all of them after the acute phase of the stroke. In the absence of documented AF, a parafibrillatory status was defined as &gt;3000 atrial ectopic beats/d or &gt;2 “micro AF” episodes (fibrillatory burst &lt;30 s)/d or ≥1 episode of “micro AF” &gt;14 s. RESULTS 130 p. were included in the study (age 73 ± 12, 57% males, 19% previous stroke, 7% ischemic cardiopathy, CHA2DSVA2Sc pre-stroke 3.1 ± 1.7). 3 were withdrawn from the study due to inadequate use (recording time &lt;14 d) and 1 due to stroke during SARS-CoV2 infection. Total recording time was 28 ± 3 d, total analyzable ECG time was 23 ± 5 d. ECG monitoring was repeated in 12 (9.5%) p due to poor ECG quality in 6 p or high suspicion of AF despite an initial negative result in 6 p. AF &gt;30 s was detected in a total of 27 (21.4%) p, average AF duration was 52 hours (range 30 s-22 d). AF &gt;30s was detected in 2 (17%) p with repeated monitoring. All these patients were placed on anticoagulation. Sustained paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) was documented in 4 (4.4%) p without AF. All episodes of AF and SVT were asymptomatic. Mobitz I second degree AV block in 4 (3.2%) p. 3 (2.4%) p had a pacemaker implanted: 2 for severe sinus dysfunction and 1 for AV block. High-density ventricular ectopy (&gt;3000/d) was present in 7 (6%) p and ≥1 episode of non-sustained ventricular tachycardia was detected in 26 (21%) p. A parafibrillatory status was identified in 27 (21%) p with no AF &gt;30 s. At 1-year follow up 4/22 (18%) of patients with parafibrillatory status and 3/59 (5%) without parafibrillatory status suffered a new stroke (p = 0.08). CONCLUSIONS: AF and other potentially relevant arrhythmias are frequent after stroke and easily detectable with one-month non-invasive continuous ECG monitoring.

The current work presents an investigation that analyzes the effectiveness of face shields as personal protective equipment. To that end, a multiphase computational fluid dynamic study based on Eulerian–Lagrangian techniques was defined to simulate the spread of the droplets produced by a sneeze. Different scenarios were evaluated where the relative humidity, ambient temperature, evaporation, mass transfer, break up, and turbulent dispersion were taken into account. The saliva that the human body generates was modeled as a saline solution of 8.8 g per 100 mL. In addition, the influence of the wind speed was studied with a soft breeze of 7 km/h and a moderate wind of 14 km/h. The results indicate that the face shield does not provide accurate protection, because only the person who is sneezed on is protected. Moreover, with a wind of 14 km/h, none of the droplets exhaled into the environment hit the face shield, instead, they were deposited onto the neck and face of the wearer. In the presence of an airflow, the droplets exhaled into the environment exceeded the safe distance marked by the WHO. Relative humidity and ambient temperature play an important role in the lifetime of the droplets.","Ugarte-Anero, Ainara Fernandez-Gamiz Unai Aramendia Iñigo Zulueta Ekaitz Lopez-Guede Jose Manuel",Mathematics,https://doi.org/10.3390/math9131582,344

Nutritional status of individual is affected by several factors such as age, sex, health status, physical activity, life style and medications. Optimal nutrition and dietary nutrient intake impact the immune system, therefore the sustainable way to survive in current context is to strengthen the immune system. Inadequate intake of energy, protein, and specific micronutrients are associated with depressed immune function and increased susceptibility to infection. Predominantly vital for the encouraging of immune function are elements selenium, iron and zinc and vitamins A, D, C, E, B6, B9(folate) and B12 as well as omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids. Thus, during this time it is important to take care of nutritional habits, following a healthy and balanced nutritional pattern containing a high amount of elements, antioxidants and vitamins. It is also recommended, that individuals should be mindful of physical activity, known to be associated with allcause mortality. Regular physical activity also improves mental health and overall feelings of wellbeing.

Metabolic activities are directly involved in modulating the immune responses against infectious diseases, yet our understanding remains limited on how host metabolism relates with inflammatory responses. To better elucidate the underlying biochemistry of leukocytes response, we focused our analysis on the possible relationships between SARS-CoV-2 post-infection stages and distinct metabolic pathways. Indeed, in cultures of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC, n=48) obtained 60-90 days after infection and showing in vitro IgG antibody memory for spike-S1 antigen (n=19), we observed a significant altered metabolism of tryptophan and urea cycle pathways. This work for the first time identifies metabolic routes in cell metabolism possibly related to later stages of immune defense against SARS-Cov-2 infection, namely when circulating antibodies may be absent, but an antibody memory is present. The results suggest a reprogramming of leukocyte metabolism after viral pathogenesis through activation of specific amino acid pathways possibly related to protective immunity against SARS-CoV-2.","Federica, Gevi; Giuseppina, Fanelli; Veronica, Lelli; Gianpaolo, Zarletti; Massimo, Tiberi; Veronica, De Molfetta; Giuseppe, Scapigliati; Maria, Timperio Anna",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.07.20.453042,344

167269,Enhancing Human-Machine Teaming for Medical Prognosis Through Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (NODEs),2021-02-08,"Introduction The Covid-19 pandemic has put a considerable strain on procedural waiting lists, with the majority of elective outpatient work cancelled during the pandemic. With the vaccination programme and reducing infection levels, attention is turning to addressing these waiting lists. One procedure that was affected was the removal of implantable loop recorders (ILRs). Manufacturers recommend that ILRs are removed at the point of battery depletion (usually 3-4 years), if they have not already been removed due to a positive finding or patient preference. There is little evidence in the literature regarding late complications with ILRs, and we therefore wished to examine what patients' thoughts would be about keeping the ILR in for a longer period of time. Methods Patients awaiting ILR explantation and those who had undergone explantation, were identified. A retrospective review of the notes was used to get demographic and clinical data. Both groups of patients were contacted, and a questionnaire used to gain an understanding of patients' experience and expectations. Results Prior to the Covid-19 pandemic, 60 patients who had undergone ILR explantation were identified. A total of 22 responded to our questionnaire (table 1). The majority (86%) were happy to have their ILR removed, although a smaller majority (59%) would also have been happy to have had the device kept in, were it felt to be safe. Very few patients felt a tangible difference as a result of having the ILR removed (14%) and no patients were worried about the waiting time prior to Covid-19. Of 77 patients currently awaiting explant, 30 responded to our questionnaire (table 1), with 70% not being concerned by the wait for removal. This is likely aided by the fact that 80% of patients had no day to day symptoms as a result of the ILR. Half of the patients however, would be concerned about not having the ILR removed, predominantly due to mild discomfort or concerns regarding the presence of a battery. Across both groups (n=52) only 8 patients were concerned about the risk of coming into the hospital for the procedure, with patients commenting that the stringent regulations that hospitals had employed combined with the vaccination programme, gave them significant confidence in attending for outpatient procedures. Conclusions This study found that if patients are reassured about the safety of keeping an implantable loop recorder in, and do not suffer any discomfort or symptoms as a result of the device, they are happy both to wait longer for device removal, or even not have it removed at all. In the context of the current pandemic, more thought should perhaps be given to patient guided removal times, especially in cases of removals performed for battery depletion.","Chattopadhyay, R.; Fares, M.; Thakur, M.; Bhattacharjee, P.; Hayes, J.; Chousou, P.

We found that positive updating after reactivation was equivalent to neutral updating in altering true memories of the aversive story, but introduced more false memory. Moreover, an additional 12 hours of sleep reconsolidation did not further enlarge true memory differences, but attenuated the effect of reactivation and updating on false memory. Interestingly, the neutral rather than the positive updating reduced the emotional arousal of the aversive memory 24 hours later. Our findings provide novel insights into real-world therapeutic applications regarding how updating with positive and neutral emotion may reshape aversive memories, especially when taking wake- and sleep-filled reconsolidation into account.","Wang, Jingyi; Chen, Boxuan; Sha, Manqi; Gu, Yiran; Wu, Haitao; Forcato, Cecilia; Qin, Shaozheng",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.01.04.424701,344

Based on this reason, in this study it was aimed to determine the epidemiological characteristics of Covid 19 possible and definite cases who applied to the university hospital during the pandemic process. Materials and Methods: This retrospective epidemiological study was carried out by analyzing the data of Covid 19 possible and definite cases, who applied to the university hospital operating as a pandemic hospital between 11 March / 01 June 2020. The data were summarized with descriptive statistics, tables and graphs. Results: Of the 1,383 patients, who applied with the suspicion of COVID-19, 55.5% were men and 84.5% were adults. The median age of children is 4.0 (1.5-10) years old;adults were 52.0 (36.0-67.0) years old. The median time between the outset of complaints and the date of admission to the hospital was 2 (1-3) days. 87.4% of adults and 87.9% of children had symptoms that supported COVID-19 infection. Among cases 7.8% were health care workers. The median age of the fatal cases was 71 (64-82) years old, 79.5% were male, 77.7% were retired. The most common comorbide diseases in these cases were hypertension (28.2%) and malignancy (28.2%). The case fatality rate was found as 2.8% in all patients and 48.4% in patients hospitalized in the intensive care unit. Conclusions: As a result, Covid-19 affects all age groups. Hypertension and malignancy were the most common additional diseases in fatal cases. The risk of illness is higher in healthcare workers who have direct contact with the patients.

There is little information regarding patients' perceptions of orthopaedic care during the pandemic. This study was designed to assess patient concerns surrounding orthopaedic care and determine what areas can be addressed to optimize orthopaedic care during this pandemic. Methods: In the spring of 2020, during this study that was exempt from institutional review board (IRB) approval, a survey designed to evaluate the attitudes and beliefs from healthcare consumers about receiving care during the COVID-19 pandemic was sent to a group of panelists via email. Results: Three hundred sixty-six (31%) out of 1,200 individuals completed the survey. The majority of participants expressed they would feel comfortable receiving care in orthopaedic clinics (48% immediately, 36% in 1 to 3 mo) in the immediate or near future. Participants reported they were more comfortable seeking orthopaedic care at an orthopedic urgent care facility (8% not comfortable) versus an emergency room (41% not comfortable). When thinking about receiving care at orthopaedic clinics, participants were most concerned about the risks of getting sick from other patients (18% extremely, 26% very). Seventeen percent of respondents reported that despite having orthopaedic concerns, they delayed seeking care due to COVID-19. One-third of respondents expressed a desire to know what precautions were in place to ensure safety. Conclusions: Patients remained interested in receiving orthopaedic care in the midst of a pandemic.

Bacteriophage (phage) therapy is being considered as a primary option for the treatment of drugresistant infections of these types. We report the successful isolation and characterisation of 30 novel, genetically diverse Klebsiella phages. The isolated phages span six different phage families and nine genera, representing both lysogenic and lytic lifestyles. Individual Klebsiella phage isolates infected up to 11 of the 18 Klebsiella capsule types tested, and all 18 capsule-types were infected by at least one of the phages. Of the Klebsiella-infecting phages presented in this study, the lytic phages are most suitable for phage therapy, based on their broad host range, high virulence, short lysis period and given that they encode no known toxin or antimicrobial resistance genes. Importantly, when applied alone, none of the characterised phages were able to suppress the growth of Klebsiella for more than 12 hours, with some phages only able to suppress growth for 3 hours, likely due to inherent ease of Klebsiella to generate spontaneous phage-resistant mutants. This indicates that for successful phage therapy, a cocktail of multiple phages would be necessary to treat Klebsiella infections.","Townsend, Eleanor; Kelly, Lucy; Gannon, Lucy; Muscatt, George; Dunstan, Rhys; Michniewski, Slawomir; Sapkota, Hari; Kiljunen, Saija J; Kolsi, Anna; Skurnik, Mikael; Lithgow, Trevor; Millard, Andrew D.; Jameson, Eleanor",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.07.05.179689,344

We used single cell RNA sequencing to define glial responses in the early postnatal somatosensory cortex after partial whisker lesion, revealing transcriptomic shifts in both astrocytes and microglia during the resulting topographic remapping. The most distinct change was the emergence of a type I interferon (IFN-I) responsive microglia population that was rare in the resting cortex but expanded 20-fold after whisker deprivation. The top gene candidate in this cluster, Ifitm3, marked a conserved but transient subset of microglia that were in the process of phagocytosing whole cells. IFITM3 protein identified this subset in vivo, where it was enriched in early microglial phagosomes. Loss of canonical IFN-I signaling in Ifnar1−/− animals resulted in abnormal ‘bubble’ microglia with deficient phagolysosomal processing. In a meta-analysis of transcriptomes, we identified the IFNI signature in microglia across a range of pathologies. We identified phagocytic IFITM3+ microglia in two murine disease models: SARS-CoV-2 infection and Alzheimer’s Disease. These data reveal the potential of transcriptional profiling after defined perturbation to elicit transient microglial states, and identify a novel role for IFN-I signaling in regulating microglial phagocytosis.","Dorman, Leah C.; Nguyen, Phi T.; Escoubas, Caroline C.; Vainchtein, Ilia D.; Xiao, Yinghong; Lidsky, Peter V.; Wang, Ellen Y.; Taloma, Sunrae E.; Nakao-Inoue, Hiromi; Rivera, Brianna M.; Condello, Carlo; Andino, Raul; Nowakowski, Tomasz J.; Molofsky, Anna V.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.04.29.441889,344

While the government put much effort into protecting the health of the population and curbing the spread of Covid-19, it was primarily inclined toward maintaining the economy and enforcing peace and stability.

Covid-19 disease has accelerated this process. Cyber criminals' interest has shifted in a real to virtual life as well. This is because it is easier to commit a crime in cyberspace rather than regular life. Malicious software (malware) is unwanted software which is frequently used by cyber criminals to launch cyber-attacks. Malware variants are continuing to evolve by using advanced obfuscation and packing techniques. These concealing techniques make malware detection and classification significantly challenging. Novel methods which are quite different from traditional methods must be used to effectively combat with new malware variants. Traditional artificial intelligence (AI) specifically machine learning (ML) algorithms are no longer effective in detecting all new and complex malware variants. Deep learning (DL) approach which is quite different from traditional ML algorithms can be a promising solution to the problem of detecting all variants of malware. In this study, a novel deep-learning-based architecture is proposed which can classify malware variants based on a hybrid model. The main contribution of the study is to propose a new hybrid architecture which integrates two wide-ranging pre-trained network models in an optimized manner. This architecture consists of four main stages, namely: data acquisition, the design of deep neural network architecture, training of the proposed deep neural network architecture, and evaluation of the trained deep neural network. The proposed method tested on Malimg, Microsoft BIG 2015, and Malevis datasets. The experimental results show that the suggested method can effectively classify malware with high accuracy which outperforms the state of the art methods in the literature. When proposed method tested on Malimg dataset, 97.78% accuracy is obtained which is outperformed most of the ML-based malware detection method.","Aslan, O.; Yilmaz, A.

The aim of this paper is to estimate setting-specific vaccination thresholds for SARS-CoV-2 to prevent sustained community transmission using classical principles of airborne contagion modeling. We calculated the airborne infection risk in three settings, a classroom, prison cell block, and restaurant, at typical ventilation rates, and then the expected number of infections resulting from this risk at varying levels of occupant susceptibility to infection. Results: We estimate the vaccination threshold for control of SARS-CoV-2 to range from a low of 40% for a mechanically ventilation classroom to a high of 85% for a naturally ventilated restaurant. Conclusions: If vaccination rates are limited to a theoretical minimum of approximately two-thirds of the population, enhanced ventilation above minimum standards for acceptable air quality is needed to reduce the frequency and severity of SARS-CoV-2 superspreading events in high-risk indoor environments.","Mikszewski, A.; Stabile, L.; Buonanno, G.; Morawska, L.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.07.28.21261300v1?rss=1,344

Here, we report that influenza viral pneumonia leads to chronic non-resolving lung pathology and exaggerated accumulation of CD8+ tissue-resident memory T cells (TRM) in the respiratory tract of aged hosts. TRM accumulation relies on elevated TGF-β present in aged tissues. Further, we show that TRM isolated from aged lungs lack a subpopulation characterized by expression of molecules involved in TCR signaling and effector function. Consequently, TRM cells from aged lungs were insufficient to provide heterologous protective immunity. Strikingly, the depletion of CD8+ TRM cells dampens persistent chronic lung inflammation and ameliorates tissue fibrosis in aged, but not young, animals. Collectively, our data demonstrate that age-associated TRM cell malfunction supports chronic lung inflammatory and fibrotic sequelae following viral pneumonia in aged hosts.","Goplen, Nick P.; Wu, Yue; Son, Youngmin; Li, Chaofan; Wang, Zheng; Cheon, In Su; Jiang, Li; Zhu, Bibo; Ayasoufi, Katayoun; Chini, Eduardo N.; Johnson, Aaron J.; Vassallo, Robert; Limper, Andrew H.; Zhang, Nu; Sun, Jie",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.13.040196,344

The new solidarity tax is one of the policies designed to help. In the Czech Republic, solidarity tax, introduced in the aftermath of the financial crisis of 2008–2009, is still levied. This paper studies the tax compliance of different income groups in the presence of solidarity tax. Most existing studies suggest declining tax compliance with income, though others found the opposite. This paper argues that the association of tax compliance with income is more complex. This paper assesses tax compliance as related to income in a continuous set-ting and by comparing income groups employing a large sample from the Czech Republic (N = 1811, 60.6% female, aged 18–82, M ± SD: 51.3 ± 17.2;19.3% with higher education). Methodologically we rely on ANOVA analyses with post-hoc tests, correlations, and ordinal regressions. We find that the associations of income and tax compliance of linear, quadratic, shift position, and slope were not statistically significant if controlling for age, gender, and education. The ethical acceptability of cheating on tax is the lowest in the middle-income group, presenting 33% of the sample. The lowest and the highest income group show more ethical flexibility in claiming state benefits if not entitled.

It is a typical irresistible sickness thus far, and not a solitary nation could set up a fruitful antibody for it. Contaminated patients with Coronavirus have demonstrated that these kinds of patients are generally tainted with lung disease upon contact with the illness. The Gold Standard for coronavirus is Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction controls for COVID-19 diagnosis (RT-PCR). Nevertheless, the RT-PCR test facility is sluggish, rendering early detection of the disease difficult. More effective and readily available imaging methods for diagnosing lung-related conditions are chest X-ray (i.e., radiography) and chest CT scan.

Patients with hematologic malignancies undergoing HSCT may be especially vulnerable to this pandemic stress given their well-documented heightened psychological distress and impaired quality of life (QOL). However, the association of the COVID-19 pandemic with distress and QOL is not well understood. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional analysis of data from 205 patients with hematologic malignancies undergoing HSCT who were enrolled in a multisite, randomized supportive care trial. We compared baseline pre-HSCT distress (depression, anxiety, and posttraumatic stress disorder [PTSD] symptoms) and QOL between participants enrolled pre-COVID-19 (i.e., 03/2019-01/2020) and during the COVID-19 pandemic (i.e., 03/2020-01/2021). We used the Hospital Anxiety & Depression Scale, PTSD Checklist, and Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Bone Marrow Transplant to assess symptoms of depression, anxiety, and PTSD, as well as QOL respectively. We used regression models adjusting for age, gender, race, relationship status, and cancer diagnosis to examine the relationship between the period of enrollment and patient-reported distress and QOL. Results: Prior to COVID-19, 124 participants enrolled, and 81 participants enrolled during the COVID-19 pandemic. The two cohorts had similar baseline demographic and disease risk factors. Most participants were non-Hispanic (n = 185;90.2%), White (n = 138;86.3%), and female (n = 131;64.5%) with a mean (SD) age of 54.9 (11.7) years. In multivariate regression models, enrollment during COVID-19 was not associated with pre-HSCT depression (B = 0.004;95% CI, -0.02 to 0.03;p = 0.73), anxiety (B = 0.008;95% CI, -0.01 to 0.03;p = 0.44), PTSD (B = 0.004;95% CI, -0.004 to 0.01;p = 0.35) symptoms or QOL (B = -0.003;95% CI, -0.02 to 0.01;p = 0.68). Conclusions: Contrary to the widespread notion that the COVID-19 pandemic has worsened distress in patients with cancer, we found no differences in pre-HSCT distress or QOL in patients with hematologic malignancies undergoing HSCT prior to or during the COVID19 pandemic. Our findings highlight the need to comprehensively explore the multifactorial causes (e.g., illness experience, treatment burden) of distress and QOL deficits in HSCT recipients irrespective of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Amonoo, H.

However, there is no documented testing method to assess for associations between biomechanics and PCI. The aim of this study was to investigate whether there is an association between an easily applicable, novel biomechanical assessment tool and PCI. Methods: Fifty male elite-level rugby union athletes (age 22.83+/-5.08) participating in the highest tier of England were tested at the start of the 2019 pre-season period and PCIs (N=48) were recorded over the 2019/20 playing season. Participants biomechanics were analysed using two-dimensional video analysis against an Injury Risk Score (IRS) system in the performance of the combined movement - prone hip extension and knee flexion. Participants biomechanics in carrying out this movement were scored against the 10-point IRS, where the more compensatory movement recorded sees an increase in an individuals IRS. Participants IRS were then compared against the number of PCI sustained and Spearmans correlation coefficient was utilised for analysis. Results: There is a good significant association between IRS and PCI (R=0.573, p<0.001). Linear Regression demonstrated that an increase of 1 in IRS was associated with a 35% increase in PCI incidence (R2=0.346). Conclusion: A good significance between the IRS and PCI provides preliminary support for its use as an injury risk assessment tool.","Hughes, R.; Cross, M.; Stokes, K.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.02.21250855v1?rss=1,344

174376,Using agent-based simulation to assess disease prevention measures during pandemics*,2021,"What is known and objective Racial differences in adverse events following COVID-19 vaccines have not been sufficiently studied. Here, we aimed to study the adverse events of Moderna's intramuscular COVID-19 vaccine in young Japanese people. Methods A case-control study was conducted using a questionnaire survey. Risk factors were determined using a multivariable logistic regression model. We also compared the occurrence of systemic adverse events in three pairs (minor and adult; male and female; and occurrence and non-occurrence of adverse events after the first dose). Propensity matching was used to balance variables. Results We analysed 3,369 data points (1,877 after the first dose and 1,492 after the second dose) obtained from a questionnaire survey of 7,965 vaccinated individuals. Comparing the results of the first and second doses, the incidence of local adverse events did not change significantly; however, the incidence of systemic adverse events increased significantly (p < 0.001). Eighty-three percent of the participants complained of local adverse events, and 65% of participants complained of systemic adverse events. Anaphylaxis occurred in one female student (0.03%). Even when an adverse event occurred, most of the symptoms improved within 3 days. Female sex was associated with systemic adverse events after the first and second doses with odds ratios (ORs) (95% confidence interval, CI) of 2.49 (2.03-3.06), and 1.83 (1.28-2.61), respectively. Age (<20 years: minor) was associated with systemic adverse events after the first dose with an OR of 1.80 (1.44-2.24). The results of the analysis of six cohorts that were created using propensity score matching showed that the incidence of systemic adverse events at the first dose in females was significantly higher than that in males, and that of minors was significantly higher than that of adults. What is new and conclusion The results of this study clarified, for the first time, the risk factors for several adverse events from the injection of Moderna's intramuscular COVID-19 vaccine in young Japanese people. This study suggests that women, minors who experienced adverse events after the first dose, those who experienced adverse events after the first dose, and those who had adverse events after the second dose, should be aware of adverse events.","Suehiro, M.; Okubo, S.; Nakajima, K.; Kanda, K.; Hayakawa, M.; Oiso, S.; Kabashima, T.; Fujita, H.; Ando, Y.; Muro, T.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.10.01.21264393v1?rss=1,344

In 2018, approximately 3.5 million truck drivers were delivering over 70% of all freight tonnage in the United States, generating close to $800 billion in gross revenue annually. While 3.5 million truck drivers represents a significant number of jobs, it is not enough to satisfy demand. The trucking industry suffers from a chronic shortage of drivers. Nearly 70,000 additional heavy-duty tractor-trailer drivers in the United States were needed at the end of 2018, according to the American Trucking Associations. New research from the University of California, Irvine explored the challenges imposed by COVID-19 on truck drivers by conducting a literature review, looking at past crises, and interviewing academic and industry experts. Key findings include: (1) Trucking activity grew in the weeks following the March 13, 2020 declaration of a national emergency. (2) Business closures following the shutdown in many states quickly depressed the demand for trucking services and erased the chronic shortage of drivers.(3) As businesses reopen, the long-term structural problems of the trucking industry still need to be addressed.","Regan, Amelia Saphores Jean-Daniel University of California Irvine",,https://doi.org/10.7922/g2x63k72,344

175755,The nature of influence and degree of confidence in the information about the pandemic among generation Z students,2021,"The human adaptive immune system must generate extraordinary diversity to be able to respond to all possible pathogens. The T-cell repertoire derives this high diversity through somatic recombination of the T-cell receptor (TCR) locus, a random process that results in repertoires that are largely private to each individual. However, certain factors such as low junctional diversity, thymic selection, and T-cell proliferation upon antigen exposure can affect TCR sharing among individuals. By immunosequencing the TCRβ variable region of 426 healthy individuals, we find that fewer than 1% of TCRβ clones are shared between individuals on average, consistent with largely private TCRβ repertoires. However, we detect a significant correlation between increased HLA allele sharing and increased number of shared TCRβ clones, with each additional shared HLA allele contributing to an increase in ∼0.01% of the total TCRβ clones being shared, supporting a key role for HLA type in shaping the immune repertoire. Surprisingly, we find that shared antigen exposure to CMV leads to fewer shared TCRβ clones, even after controlling for HLA, indicative of a largely private response to major viral antigenic exposure. Consistent with this hypothesis, we find that increased age is correlated with decreased overall TCRβ clone sharing, indicating that the pattern of private TCRβ clonal expansion is a general feature of the T-cell response to other infectious antigens. All of these factors contribute to shaping the TCRβ repertoire, and understanding their interplay has important implications for the use of T cells for therapeutics and diagnostics.","Johnson, Sarah A.; Seale, Spencer L.; Gittelman, Rachel M.; Rytlewski, Julie A.; Robins, Harlan S.; Fields, Paul A.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.03.19.436220,344
175782,Topological features of multivariate distributions: dependency on the covariance matrix,2021,"Abstract Foodborne and waterborne viral infections are increasingly recognized as causes of illness in humans. This increase is partly explained by changes in food processing and consumption patterns that lead to the worldwide availability of high-risk food. As a result, vast outbreaks may occur due to contamination of food by a single foodhandler or at a single source. Although there are numerous fecal–orally transmitted viruses, most reports of foodborne transmission describe infections with Norwalk-like caliciviruses (NLV) and hepatitis A virus (HAV), suggesting that these viruses are associated with the greatest risk of foodborne transmission. NLV and HAV can be transmitted from person to person, or indirectly via food, water, or fomites contaminated with virus-containing feces or vomit. People can be infected without showing symptoms. The high frequency of secondary cases of NLV illness and – to a lesser extent – of hepatitis A following a foodborne outbreak results in amplification of the problem. The burden of illness is highest in the elderly, and therefore is likely to increase due to the aging population. For HAV, the burden of illness may increase following hygienic control measures, due to a decreasing population of naturally immune individuals and a concurrent increase in the population at risk. Recent advances in the research of NLV and HAV have led to the development of molecular methods which can be used for molecular tracing of virus strains. These methods can be and have been used for the detection of common source outbreaks. While traditionally certain foods have been implicated in virus outbreaks, it is clear that almost any food item can be involved, provided it has been handled by an infected person. There are no established methods for detection of viruses in foods other than shellfish. Little information is available on disinfection and preventive measures specifically for these viruses. Studies addressing this issue are hampered by the lack of culture systems. As currently available routine monitoring systems exclusively focus on bacterial pathogens, efforts should be made to combine epidemiological and virological information for a combined laboratory-based rapid detection system for foodborne viruses. With better surveillance, including typing information, outbreaks of foodborne infections could be reported faster to prevent further spread.","Koopmans, Marion; von Bonsdorff, Carl-Henrik; Vinjé, Jan; de Medici, Dario; Monroe, Steve",FEMS Microbiology Reviews,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0168644502000967; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168644502000967,344
175784,How China's Wildlife Trade Legislation Permits Commercial Trade in Protected Wild Animal Species,2021,"Purpose The authors track the well-being of individuals across five European countries during the course of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and relate their well-being to working from home. The authors also consider the role of pandemic-policy stringency in affecting well-being in Europe. Design/methodology/approach The authors have four waves of novel harmonised longitudinal data in France, Italy, Germany, Spain and Sweden, covering the period May-November 2020. Well-being is measured in five dimensions: life satisfaction, a worthwhile life, loneliness, depression and anxiety. A retrospective diary indicates whether the individual was working in each month since February 2020 and if so whether at home or not at home. Policy stringency is matched in per country at the daily level. The authors consider both cross-section and panel regressions and the mediating and moderating effects of control variables, including household variables and income. Findings Well-being among workers is lower for those who work from home, and those who are not working have the lowest well-being of all. The panel results are more mitigated, with switching into working at home yielding a small drop in anxiety. The panel and cross-section difference could reflect adaptation or the selection of certain types of individuals into working at home. Policy stringency is always negatively correlated with well-being. The authors find no mediation effects. The well-being penalty from working at home is larger for the older, the better-educated, those with young children and those with more crowded housing. Originality/value The harmonised cross-country panel data on individuals' experiences during COVID-19 are novel. The authors relate working from home and policy stringency to multiple well-being measures. The authors emphasise the effect of working from home on not only the level of well-being but also its distribution.","Schifano, S.; Clark, A.

Here, we collected fish diversity data from coral reefs at the Israeli Gulf of Aqaba during and after the COVID-19 lockdown. We examined beach entrances to the reef, nearby shallow reefs and deeper areas exposed mostly to divers. We found that the lockdown elicited a behavioral response that resulted in elevated species richness at designated reef entrances, predominantly influenced by increased evenness without changes to total abundances. This effect was observed both at the local scale and when several beach entrances were aggregated together. Consequently, non-extractive human activities may have substantial short-term impacts on fish diversity. Our insights could help designate guidelines to manage visitor impacts on coral reefs and aid in their prolonged persistence.","China, V.; Zvuloni, A.; Roll, U.; Belmaker, J.",Biological Conservation,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biocon.2021.109103,344

This drug baricitinib is able to suppress the systemic inflammatory response, which is one of the common causes of death in COVID-19, is an urgent problem of the study. The study was carried out in the Regional Specialized Budget Infectious Diseases Hospital of Stavropol (Russian Federation, Stavropol Region). In a multivariate analysis, it was shown that the use of baricitinib was associated with a decrease in the frequency of the primary endpoint of death/need for invasive lung ventilation. The use of baricitinib was quite safe, but in some patients there was an increase in the level of transaminases. No cases of hypercoagulation have been reported while taking baricitinib. It was found that patients with a normal BMI are more sensitive to therapy than those who are overweight.75% of patients in the first group had a temperature above 38.0 degrees C. However, against the background of taking the standard treatment regimen and baricitinib, it was noted that the temperature stabilized during the day and did not rise again. Against the background of taking baricitinib, the elimination of the phenomena of respiratory failure and the refusal of an oxygen mask occurred 3.1 times more often than without baricitinib. The authors concluded that the use of baricitinib can be considered as an additional therapy for moderate forms of pneumonia in patients over 65 years or in patients with concomitant chronic diseases in order to suppress the reactions of systemic inflammation and the development of serious respiratory and other system lesions caused by COVID-19.","Maslova, A.

177024,What makes our lungs look red?,2021-03-13,"We report results from searches for anisotropic stochastic gravitational-wave backgrounds using data from the first three observing runs of the Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo detectors. For the first time, we include Virgo data in our analysis and run our search with a new efficient pipeline called {\tt PyStoch} on data folded over one sidereal day. We use gravitational-wave radiometry (broadband and narrow band) to produce sky maps of stochastic gravitational-wave backgrounds and to search for gravitational waves from point sources. A spherical harmonic decomposition method is employed to look for gravitational-wave emission from spatially-extended sources. Neither technique found evidence of gravitational-wave signals. Hence we derive 95\% confidence-level upper limit sky maps on the gravitational-wave energy flux from broadband point sources, ranging from $F_{\alpha, \Theta}<{\rm (0.013 - 7.6)} \times 10^{-8} {\rm erg \, cm^{-2} \, s^{-1} \, Hz^{-1}},$ and on the (normalized) gravitational-wave energy density spectrum from extended sources, ranging from $\Omega_{\alpha, \Theta}<{\rm (0.57 - 9.3)} \times 10^{-9} \, {\rm sr^{-1}}$, depending on direction ($\Theta$) and spectral index ($\alpha$). These limits improve upon previous limits by factors of $2.9 - 3.5$. We also set 95\% confidence level upper limits on the frequency-dependent strain amplitudes of quasimonochromatic gravitational waves coming from three interesting targets, Scorpius X-1, SN 1987A and the Galactic Center, with best upper limits range from $h_0<{\rm (1.7-2.1)} \times 10^{-25},$ a factor of $\geq 2.0$ improvement compared to previous stochastic radiometer searches.","Collaboration, The LIGO Scientific; Collaboration, the Virgo; Abbott, the KAGRA Collaboration R.; Abbott, T.

Therefore, this has caused a fiscal lost that affects the country. In this sense, the following work proposes to highlight a review of the data available and pertinent to the case, summarize them and present them in a clear and concise way so they can serve as a reference source for future research works. © 2021 AISTI.","Andrade, S.; Lagos, E.; Merchan, V.; Toasa, R.

A sociological survey using the Likert methodology, an in-depth interview and a focus group were used as empirical methods. In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, the study was conducted remotely using Google Form, VoIP service Skype and a cloud conference platform: Zoom. The study revealed that Russian and Slovak young people of Generation Z are contradictory to any information: Russian Gen Z students found a contradiction over the credibility of pandemic statistics and the usefulness of COVID 19 information in the media;Slovak Gen Z students are inclined to believe that information about the pandemic is far-fetched, while most Slovak respondents in this study expressed confidence in information about pandemic. When comparing the aggregates by qualitative characteristics, certain similarities were revealed: there is a statistical significance between the factorial and effective characteristics with a high and very high positive correlation. The results obtained can help develop views on the nature of the impact and the degree of confidence in information about the COVID 19 pandemic among representatives of different generations.","Vinichenko, M.

178373,Financial earthquakes: SARS-CoV-2 news shock propagation in stock and sovereign bond markets,2021,"IntroductionCOVID-related situation has produced multiple challenges in the field of implementation of the restrictions.ObjectivesRussian media, NGOs and sociological institutions collected and processed data on following the COVID-related guidelines in Moscow and in other regions. According to these data, different social groups behave differently in respect to the restrictions.MethodsThe following methods were used: analysis of information in media, interviews with child psychologists and pedagogues, personal involved and non-involved observation.ResultsThe COVID-related restrictions are often violated in all the Russian provinces. Observation and interviews demonstrate similar results. Young people aged 13–20 transgress the regulations most often. The reasons for that are not only the insufficient information, but also neurotic reactions and respective behavior: suppression, reaction formations, reactions of denial. Moreover, new behavioral norms (e.g. wearing masks) are insufficiently shaped yet, which makes following the new rules even more difficult. Furthermore, during the introduction of those regulations, their possible pathopsychological consequences were not taken into consideration, e.g. consequences of isolation, maintaining social distance, communication while wearing masks, fears, stress, paranoic reactions.ConclusionsThe pathopsychological consequences of introduced measures should be taken into consideration. Moreover, the phrasing of regulations needs reshaping and implementation of techniques of mental hygiene to prevent the development of mental disorders. Efficient shaping of respective skills might help to increase the percent of people following the guidelines too. However, all those issues require additional research.","Burlakova, N.; Oleshkevich, V.",European Psychiatry,https://doi.org/10.1192/j.eurpsy.2021.820,344
178406,Accuracy-Efficiency Trade-Offs and Accountability in Distributed ML Systems,2020-07-04,"Objectives: The main scientific contribution of this study is to design an approach that can regulate school safety and student health in gardens and classes during the pandemic period using GIS. Methods: The method of this study is based on the use of school areas and building data, the creation of 4m2 social distance areas for students, and the evaluation of these areas in terms of health measures. To this aim, first, the relevant guidelines issued by the government institutions in Turkey during the COVID-19 process were examined, in relation to how they will reflect on education policies regarding the sanitary safety of schools. This data was obtained from open-source data sets. Then, in the application stage, 20 schools were selected in order to analyse the sustainability of education in the Balgat district. In addition, the sanitary conditions of classrooms and garden areas were evaluated within the framework of educational policies, taking into account the capabilities of geographical information systems (GIS). Results: The findings indicated that 95% of school gardens comply with pandemic regulations, and only 38.9% of school classes can support education in two periods through binary grouping. Conclusions: It has been concluded that school buildings are well-planned in terms of health measures for gardens and classes. In addition, GIS were found to be very useful for analysing areas in terms of student health, comparing schools regionally, tracking the spread of the pandemic, and identifying high-risk school areas.","Başeğmez, M.; Coşkun Aydın, C.",Health Policy and Technology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.hlpt.2021.100546,344

Using police data on weekly counts of collisions, we compared trends in 2020 with those of 2019, while controlling for the reduction of traffic volumes and seasonal weather conditions. Results of difference-in-differences estimation suggest that during the early months of the pandemic, or March-May, the incidence rates of severe or fatal injury crashes related to speeding increased by nearly 8 times in Seattle and more than 4 times in New York City. In the rest of 2020, they were still significantly higher than what would be expected in the absence of the pandemic. This research suggests that in similar situations that depress travel demand (e.g., another pandemic), policymakers should formulate plans to reduce speeding which may prevent an upswing in severe injuries and fatalities.","Liao, H.; Lowry, M.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.08.08.21261745v1?rss=1,344
179373,Cases and stories of transformative action research: Five decades of collaborative action and learning,2021,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) as a global public health emergency, has exposed the fragility of health systems. Access to healthcare became a scarce commodity as healthcare providers and resource-poor populations became victims of the novel corona virus. Therefore, this study focuses on Africa's readiness to integrate telemedicine into the weak health systems and how the adoption may help alleviate poor healthcare and poverty after COVID-19. We conducted a narrative review through different search strategies in Scopus on January 20, 2021, to identify available literature reporting implementation of various telemedicine modes in Africa from January 1, 2011 to December 31, 2020. We summarized 54 studies according to geographies, field, and implementation methods. The results show a willingness to adopt telemedicine in the resource-poor settings and hard-to-reach populations, which will bring relief to the inadequate healthcare systems and alleviate poverty of those who most feel the burden of healthcare costs. With adequate government financing, telemedicine promises to enhance the treating of communicable and non-communicable diseases as well as support health infrastructure. It can also alleviate poverty among vulnerable groups and hard-to-reach communities in Africa with adequate government financing. However, given the lack of funding in Africa, the challenges in implementing telemedicine require global and national strategies before it can yield promising results. This is especially true in regards to alleviating the multidimensionality of poverty in post-COVID-19 Africa.","Yinka, Akintunde Tosin David Akintunde Oluseye Musa Taha Hussein Muhideen Sayibu Tassang Angwi Enow Reed Linda Chen Shaojun",Global Health Journal,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.glohj.2021.07.006,344

As vaccines are expected to strongly aid the prevention of diseases such as influenza and COVID-19, this research discusses how a modification of the well-known Susceptible-Vaccinated-Infected-Recovered-Susceptible (SVIRS) model can help prevent these diseases. This study involves employing a combination of vaccination and social distancing as a means of preventing these diseases. The SVIRS model divides the human population into four subpopulations:, those susceptible to influenza, vaccinated, infected, and recovered from influenza. Subpopulations of people who have been given the vaccine are also assumed to be susceptible to influenza, owing to the imperfect effectiveness of the vaccine. Also, since immunity to the disease is not life-long, there is a possibility that recovered individuals may get re-infected. Analytical studies of the nondimensionalization process and the existence and stability of the equilibrium points were carried out on the model, using the bifurcation analysis. Finally, a few numerical simulations were carried out using several scenarios of vaccination and social distancing strategies. Our model indicated the possibility of backward bifurcation at R0 = 1. Based on the analytical studies, R0 gave an insight to determine the best strategy that can be used to prevent the spread of influenza among the population. © 2021 Author(s).","Husnulkhotimah, H.; Rusin, R.; Aldila, D.","6th International Symposium on Current Progress in Mathematics and Sciences 2020, ISCPMS 2020",https://doi.org/10.1063/5.0058692,344
179678,Prescribing Skills Assessment,2021,"Introduction: Combustible tobacco smoking is a leading cause of death and disability worldwide. E-cigarettes are promoted for smoking cessation, but evidence on how their use relates to smoking uptake is limited. Methods: We searched PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, PsychINFO (Ovid), Medline (Ovid) and Wiley Cochrane Library in April 2020. Studies of non-smokers - never, not current, and former smokers - with a baseline measure of e-cigarette use and an outcome measure of combustible smoking uptake were included. Results: Of 6,225 studies identified, 3 systematic reviews (incorporating 13 primary research studies) and 12 additional studies were included in umbrella and top-up systematic reviews, respectively. All 25 studies found increased risk of smoking uptake with e-cigarette exposure, although magnitude varied substantially. Using a random-effects model, comparing e-cigarette users versus non-e-cigarette users, among never-smokers at baseline the odds ratio (OR) for smoking initiation was 3.25 (95%CI 2.61-4.05, I2 85.7%) and among non-smokers at baseline the OR for current smoking was 2.87 (95%CI 1.97-4.19, I2 90.1%). Among former smokers, smoking relapse was higher in e-cigarette users versus non-users (OR=2.40, 95% CI 1.50-3.83, I2 12.3%). Conclusions: Across multiple settings, non-smokers who use e-cigarettes are consistently more likely than non-e-cigarettes users to initiate combustible cigarette smoking and become current smokers; risk magnitude varied, with an average of around three times the odds. Former smokers using e-cigarettes have over twice the odds of relapse as non-e-cigarettes users. This study is the first to our knowledge to review and pool data on the latter topic.","Baenziger, O.

180301,"How dynamic social activity shapes an epidemic: waves, plateaus, and endemic state",2021-02-01,"BackgroundParamedics are experiencing numerous policy and guideline changes in addition to facing enhanced risk of personal exposure during the COVID-19 pandemic. The COVID-19 outbreak offers an opportunity to capture the experiences of paramedics during substantial and rapid changes to workplace policy, guidelines, and professional roles in the healthcare system. To date, this ongoing study has captured a better understanding of the lived experiences of English paramedics.MethodData were collected through an online survey, consisting of QUAN +QUAL questions. The study, theoretically grounded in a phenomenological approach, employed inductive thematic analysis to code the data. QUAN answers were analysed using descriptive statistics and chi-square to test for association between demographic data and answers.ResultsA total of 34 survey responses from September – December 2020 have been received from across England, with the survey remaining open. Major themes to date have identified both professional and personal elements. There is a feeling of increased pressure related to public expectation, with noted increases in call volumes in some areas. There has been a change to the workforce and increased levels of sickness. The type and level of PPE as well as employer communication varies depending on the area respondents work in. Many participants also expressed increased stress, exhaustion and anxiety negatively impacting their mental health.ConclusionsEarly results confirm a need for paramedics to adapt professional approaches to overcome barriers presented by COVID-19. There appears to be a disparity in the amount of communication, PPE and support depending on the area worked in. Respondents are fatigued and worried about others, including families. Yet, there remains a clear professional attitude and commitment to providing care throughout the pandemic. The survey remains open with a comparison of data between Canada and England planned.","Cormack, Stef Ford-Jones Polly Cameron Cheryl Smith J.

181991,"Changes in Underwater Noise and Vessel Traffic in the Approaches to Halifax Harbor, Nova Scotia, Canada",2021,"Background: Immediately following the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, the number of giant cell arteritis (GCA) diagnoses noticeably increased at the Royal National Hospital for Rheumatic Diseases in Bath, UK. Furthermore, there was an increase in the proportion of patients with visual complications [1]. The finding supports the viral hypothesis of GCA aetiopathogenesis as previously described [2]. This not only has ramifications for understanding the underlying disease mechanisms in GCA but also has implications for the provision of local GCA services which may have already be affected by the pandemic. Objectives: The objective of the study was to estimate the incidence of giant cell arteritis during the COVID-19 pandemic years of 2020 -2021 and compare it to 2019 data. Given that there have now been two distinct peaks of COVID-19 as reflected by hospital admissions of COVID-19-positive patients this has allowed us to investigate if there is a temporal relationship between the prevalence of COVID-19 and the incidence of GCA. Methods: The incidence of GCA was calculated by assessing emailed referrals to the GCA service and the hospital electronic medical records to identity positive cases from 2019 to the current date. Local COVID-19 prevalence was estimated by measuring the number of hospital beds taken up by COVID-19 positive patients, available publicly in a UK Government COVID-19 dataset [3]. Results: There were 61 (95% Poisson distribution confidence interval [CI] 47 -78) probable or definite GCA diagnoses made in 2020 compared to 28 (CI 19 -40) in 2019 (Figure 1). This is an excess of 33 cases in 2020, or an increase in 118%. Given that 41% of the hospital's catchment population is over 50, this equates to an annual incidence rate of 13.7 per 100,000 in 2019 and 29.8 per 100,000 in 2020. This compares to a previously estimated regional incidence rate of 21.6 per 100,000 for the South West of the UK [4]. A peak in COVID-19-positive inpatients was seen on 10th April 2020 with a corresponding peak of GCA diagnoses on 29th May 2020, giving a lag period of approximately 6 weeks between these peaks (Figure 1). Conclusion: The incidence of GCA in Bath was significantly increased in 2020 compared to 2019. This may be the result of the widespread infection of the local population with the COVID-19 virus as a precipitating factor. Possible mechanisms include, but are not limited to, endothelial disruption by the virus, immune system priming towards T helper cell type 1 (Th1) cellular immunity and/or activation of the monocyte-macrophage system. More work is currently underway to assess the causal relationship between the two diseases. There was a lag period of 6 weeks between the peak during the first wave of the pandemic and the rise in GCA cases. We shall be closely monitoring the number of referrals that follow the current wave of the pandemic.","Mulhearn, B.; Ellis, J.; Skeoch, S.; Pauling, J.; Tansley, S.",Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases,https://doi.org/10.1136/annrheumdis-2021-eular.848,344

However, little is known about the impact of cancer status on presentation and outcome. Here, we report on the association between cancer status and survival in hospitalized patients who tested positive for SARSCoV- 2 during the height of pandemic in New York City. Methods: Of the 6,724 patients who were hospitalized at NYU Langone Health (3/16/20 -7/31/20) and tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, 580 had either active cancer (n = 221) or a history of cancer (n = 359). Patients were classified as having active malignancy if they either received treatment within six months of their COVID-19 diagnosis or they had measurable disease documented at the time of their hospitalization. Patients were categorized as having a history of cancer if there was no evidence of measurable disease or there were no treatments administered within six months of their COVID-19 diagnosis. We compared the baseline clinicodemographic characteristics and hospital courses of the two groups, and the relationship between cancer status and the rate of admission to the intensive care unit (ICU), use of invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV), and all-cause mortality. Results: There was no differences between the two groups in their baseline laboratory results associated with COVID- 19 infection, incidence of venous thromboembolism, or incidence of severe COVID- 19. Active cancer status was not associated with the rate of ICU admission (P =0.307) or use of IMV (P = 0.236), but was significantly associated with worse all-cause mortality in both univariate and multivariate analysis with ORs of 1.48 (95% CI: 1.04-2.09;P = 0.028) and 1.71 (95% CI: 1.12- 2.63;P = 0.014), respectively. Conclusions: Active cancer patients had worse survival outcomes compared to patients with a history of cancer despite similar COVID-19 disease characteristics in the two groups. Our data suggest that cancer care should continue with minimal interruptions during the pandemic to bring about response and remission as soon as possible. Additionally, these findings support the growing body of evidence that malignancy portends worse COVID-19 prognosis, and demonstrate that the risk may even apply to those without active disease.","Sawyers, A.; Chou, M.; Johannet, P.; Gulati, N.; Qian, Y.; Zhong, H.; Osman, I.",Journal of Clinical Oncology,https://doi.org/10.1200/jco.2021.39.15-suppl.10572,344

In most animals, the extreme polymorphism of MHC molecules complicates studies of the role of this complex in the immune response. In mice, however, MHC haplotype-homozygous inbred strains have been developed which are invaluable in the study of the immune system and the search for immune response genes. The human MHC bears many similarities to its murine equivalent with regard to antigen structure and polymorphism; furthermore, a number of combinations of specific MHC alleles between HLA-B and HLA-DR/DQ (extended haplotypes) are found in people more commonly than predicted by individual allele frequencies. Over 30 percent of Caucasian haplotypes are extended haplotypes, and over 55 percent of individuals have at least one extended haplotype. Examples of the same extended haplotype, even in unrelated individuals, should either all have or lack any gene within the MHC region. The value of considering extended haplotypes in searching for associations between the MHC and diseases, or immune response, is shown in three examples: congenital adrenal hyperplasia, hepatitis B immunization, and transfusion-associated graft-versus-host disease.","Kruskall, M.

187064,Navigating the Zika panic.,2016,"Episodic wheezing associated with viral infections of the upper respiratory tract (URT) is a common problem in young children but also occurs in adults. It is hypothesized that an experimental infection with human coronavirus (HCoV), the second most prevalent common cold virus, would cause lower respiratory tract (LRT) changes in adults with a history of viral wheeze. Twenty-four viral wheezers (15 atopic) and 19 controls (seven atopic) were inoculated with HCoV 229E and monitored for the development of symptoms, changes in airway physiology and provocative concentration of methacholine causing a 20% fall in forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) (PC20). At baseline, viral wheezers were similar to controls in PC20 (mean+/-SD log2PC20: 5.1+/-1.9 and 5.8+/-1.4 g x L(-1), respectively) but had a lower FEV1 than controls (mean+/-SD 85.8+/-11.4 and 95.6+/-13.2% predicted, respectively p < 0.05). Nineteen viral wheezers and 11 controls developed colds. Viral wheezers with colds reported significantly more URT symptoms than controls (median scores (interquartile range): 24 (10-37) and 6 (4-15), respectively p = 0.014). Sixteen viral wheezers and no controls reported LRT symptoms (wheeze, chest tightness and shortness of breath). The viral wheezers with colds had small (3-4%) reductions in FEV1 and peak expiratory flow on days with LRT symptoms (days 3-6), but a progressive reduction in PC20 from baseline on days 2, 4 and 17 after inoculation (by 0.82, 1.35 and 1.82 doubling concentrations, respectively). The fall in PC20 affected both atopic and nonatopic subjects equally. There were no changes in FEV1 or PC20 in controls. An adult model of viral wheeze that is independent of atopy and therefore, of classical atopic asthma was established.","Mckean, M C; Leech, M; Lambert, P C; Hewitt, C; Myint, S; Silverman, M",The European respiratory journal,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11510797/,344
187142,Advances in the value of eggs and egg components for human health.,2005,"Coronavirus (CoV) species are very common among animals, especially bats. The last two decades three large CoV outbreaks have appeared among humans; Severe Adult Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-1) in 2003, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) in 2012 and SARS-2 in 2019, (COVID19). Also a large epidemic among swine, Swine Acute Diarrhea Syndrome (SADS) appeared in 2017 in China. There is a pool of coronavirus among bats which have the potential to infect humans through the ACE2 receptor, and new human epidemics can be expected. Therefore it is of great importance to develop new antivirals and vaccines against CoV as well as to improve the global infectious disease control of these infections.","Sönnerborg, Anders",Lakartidningen,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32365214/,344
187636,Correspondence.,1885,"Machine Learning (ML) models typically require large-scale, balanced training data to be robust, generalizable, and effective in the context of healthcare. This has been a major issue for developing ML models for the coronavirus-disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic where data is highly imbalanced, particularly within electronic health records (EHR) research. Conventional approaches in ML use cross-entropy loss (CEL) that often suffers from poor margin classification. For the first time, we show that contrastive loss (CL) improves the performance of CEL especially for imbalanced EHR data and the related COVID-19 analyses. This study has been approved by the Institutional Review Board at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai. We use EHR data from five hospitals within the Mount Sinai Health System (MSHS) to predict mortality, intubation, and intensive care unit (ICU) transfer in hospitalized COVID-19 patients over 24 and 48 hour time windows. We train two sequential architectures (RNN and RETAIN) using two loss functions (CEL and CL). Models are tested on full sample data set which contain all available data and restricted data set to emulate higher class imbalance.CL models consistently outperform CEL models with the restricted data set on these tasks with differences ranging from 0.04 to 0.15 for AUPRC and 0.05 to 0.1 for AUROC. For the restricted sample, only the CL model maintains proper clustering and is able to identify important features, such as pulse oximetry. CL outperforms CEL in instances of severe class imbalance, on three EHR outcomes with respect to three performance metrics: predictive power, clustering, and feature importance. We believe that the developed CL framework can be expanded and used for EHR ML work in general.","Wanyan, Tingyi; Honarvar, Hossein; Jaladanki, Suraj K; Zang, Chengxi; Naik, Nidhi; Somani, Sulaiman; Freitas, Jessica K De; Paranjpe, Ishan; Vaid, Akhil; Miotto, Riccardo; Nadkarni, Girish N; Zitnik, Marinka; ArifulAzad,; Wang, Fei; Ding, Ying; Glicksberg, Benjamin S",ArXiv,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33442560/,344
187874,[Endovascular treatment of intracranial aneurysms].,1999,"Mammalian reoviruses exhibit differences in the capacity to grow in intestinal tissue: reovirus type 1 Lang (T1L), but not type 3 Dearing (T3D), can be recovered in high titer from intestinal tissue of newborn mice after oral inoculation. We investigated whether in vitro protease treatment of virions of T1L and T3D, using conditions to generate infectious subvirion particles (ISVPs) as occurs in the intestinal lumen of mice (D. K. Bodkin, M. L. Nibert, and B. N. Fields, J. Virol. 63:4676-4681, 1989), affects viral infectivity. Chymotrypsin treatment of T1L was associated with a 2-fold increase in viral infectivity, whereas identical treatment of T3D resulted in a 10-fold decrease in infectivity. Using sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, we found that loss of T3D infectivity was correlated with cleavage of its sigma 1 protein. We used reassortant viruses to identify viral determinants of infectivity loss and sigma 1 cleavage and found that both phenotypes segregate with the sigma 1-encoding S1 gene. Comparable results were obtained when trypsin treatment of virions of T1L and T3D was used. In experiments to determine the fate of sigma 1 fragments following cleavage, the capacity of anti-sigma 1 monoclonal antibody G5 to neutralize infectivity of T3D ISVPs was significantly decreased in comparison with its capacity to neutralize infectivity of virions, suggesting that a sigma 1 domain bound by G5 is lost from viral particles after proteolytic digestion. In contrast to the decrease in infectivity, chymotrypsin treatment of T3D virions leading to generation of ISVPs resulted in a 10-fold increase in their capacity to produce hemagglutination, indicating that a domain of sigma 1 important for binding to sialic acid remains associated with viral particles after sigma 1 cleavage. Neuraminidase treatment of L cells substantially decreased the yield of T3D ISVPs in comparison with the yield of virions, indicating that a sigma 1 domain important for binding sialic acid also can mediate attachment of T3D ISVPs to L cells and lead to productive infection. These results suggest that cleavage of T3D sigma 1 protein following oral inoculation of newborn mice is at least partly responsible for the decreased growth of T3D in the intestine and provide additional evidence that T3D sigma 1 contains more than a single receptor-binding domain.","Nibert, M L; Chappell, J D; Dermody, T S",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7609075/,344
188206,Societal responses to familiar versus unfamiliar risk: comparisons of influenza and SARS in Korea.,2006,"The marked proliferation of activated CD8+ T cells is pathognomonic of EBV-associated infectious mononucleosis (IM), common in young adults. Since the diversity and size of the memory CD8+ T cell population increase with age, we questioned whether IM was mediated by the reactivation of memory CD8+ T cells specific to previously encountered pathogens but cross-reactive with EBV. Of 8 HLA-A2+ IM patients, 5 had activated T cells specific to another common virus, as evidenced by a significantly higher number of peripheral blood influenza A virus M1(58-66)-specific T cells compared with healthy immune donors. Two patients with an augmented M1 response had tetramer-defined cross-reactive cells recognizing influenza M1 and EBV-BMLF1(280-288), which accounted for up to one-third of their BMLF1-specific population and likely contributed to a skewed M1-specific T cell receptor repertoire. These epitopes, with only 33% sequence similarity, mediated differential effects on the function of the cross-reactive T cells, which may contribute to alterations in disease outcome. EBV could potentially encode an extensive pool of T cell epitopes that activate other cross-reactive memory T cells. Our results support the concept that cross-reactive memory CD8+ T cells activated by EBV contribute to the characteristic lymphoproliferation of IM.","Clute, Shalyn C; Watkin, Levi B; Cornberg, Markus; Naumov, Yuri N; Sullivan, John L; Luzuriaga, Katherine; Welsh, Raymond M; Selin, Liisa K",The Journal of clinical investigation,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16308574/,344

However, it remains uncertain whether apoptotic defects are essential for tumor maintenance. To test this, we generated mice expressing a conditional BCL-2 gene and constitutive c-myc that develop lymphoblastic leukemia. Eliminating BCL-2 yielded rapid loss of leukemic cells and significantly prolonged survival, formally validating BCL-2 as a rational target for cancer therapy. Loss of this single molecule resulted in cell death, despite or perhaps attributable to the presence of other oncogenic events. This suggests a generalizable model in which aberrations inherent to cancer generate tonic death signals that would otherwise kill the cell if not opposed by a requisite apoptotic defect(s).","Letai, Anthony; Sorcinelli, Mia D; Beard, Caroline; Korsmeyer, Stanley J",Cancer cell,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15380515/,344

191841,An interactive Internet-based system for tracking upper limb motion in home-based rehabilitation.,2008,"INTRODUCTION Israel is currently struggling with the Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) caused by SARS CoV-2. Transmission is increasing, with higher morbidity and mortality among populations at risk. Over-representation of blood type A was reported in COVID-19 patients with increased respiratory failure, while blood type O seems to have a protective effect. This may be caused by interference of anti-A antibodies in viral binding to the ACE receptor, different neutralization antibodies potency or variations in the stability of von Willebrand factor (VWF) multimers in different blood types. Since transfusion of convalescent COVID19 Plasma (CCP) is an accepted therapeutic modality, the Ministry of Health initiated a national project whereby CCP is collected by Magen David Adom (MDA) Blood Services using apheresis procedures and transfusions are approved by an experts committee, as part of the clinical trial or as compassionate treatment. Preliminary analysis of 49/170 patients treated so far shows improvement in 49%, with important relations with the anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies level in the transfused plasma. Anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were found in 83% of 1100 CCP donors, but a 13% decrease in antibodies level was detected in repeat donations. Blood type A was more predominant among CCP donors, when compared to MDA blood donors' data. A transfusion of CCP is a feasible and relatively safe therapeutic modality, mainly for patients with moderate COVID 19. CCP also serves as a source for the production of hyperimmune globulin for the treatment of COVID 19 and for passive immunization for populations at risk.","Izak, Marina; Yahalom, Vered; Maor, Yasmin; Zimhoni, Oren; Cohen, Daniel; Chen, Jacob; Shinar, Eilat",Harefuah,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33749174/,344

The key components of the programme include clinical leadership, auditing of hand hygiene compliance with thrice yearly reporting of improvement in hand hygiene practice, biannual reporting of the outcome marker, healthcare-associated Staphylococcus aureus bacteraemia (HA-SAB), effective communication with key stakeholders and the use of the front-line ownership (FLO) principles for quality improvement. RESULTS The nationally aggregated hand hygiene compliance has increased from 62% in June 2012 to 81% in March 2016. There has been improvement across all 'moments', all healthcare worker groups and a range of different clinical specialties. The rate of HA-SAB has remained stable.

Site-directed mutagenesis studies have shown that the Cys1274 and His1435 residues are essential for the PLPD-1 activity, suggesting that they may be the components of the catalytic centre of this proteinase. Coexpression and immunoprecipitation studies have further revealed that PLPD can interact with the 87 kDa protein. Meanwhile, data obtained from the construction and expression of a series of deletion mutants have indicated that the 87 kDa protein is encoded by the 5'-most 2600 bp part of ORF1a. further deletion and mutagenesis studies are underway to determine precisely the C-terminal cleavage site of the 87 kDa protein.","Lim, K P; Liu, D X",Advances in experimental medicine and biology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9782279/,344
198635,Poliomyelitis serosurveillance in adolescent population.,1981,"SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) has been one of the most severe viral infectious diseases last year and still remains as a highly risky public health problem around the world. Exploring the types of interactions responsible for structural stabilities of its component protein molecules constitutes one of the approaches to find a destabilization method for the virion particle. In this study, we performed a series of experiments to characterize the quaternary structure of the dimeric coronavirus main protease (M(pro), 3CL(pro)). By using the analytical ultracentrifuge, we demonstrated that the dimeric SARS coronavirus main protease exists as the major form in solution at protein concentration as low as 0.10 mg/mL at neutral pH. The enzyme started to dissociate at acidic and alkali pH values. Ionic strength has profound effect on the dimer stability indicating that the major force involved in the subunit association is ionic interactions. The effect of ionic strength on the protease molecule was reflected by the drastic change of electrostatic potential contour of the enzyme in the presence of NaCl. Analysis of the crystal structures indicated that the interfacial ionic interaction was attributed to the Arg-4...Glu-290 ion pair between the subunits. Detailed examination of the dimer-monomer equilibrium at different pH values reveals apparent pK(a) values of 8.0 +/- 0.2 and 5.0 +/- 0.1 for the Arg-4 and Glu-290, respectively. Mutation at these two positions reduces the association affinity between subunits, and the Glu-290 mutants had diminished enzyme activity. This information is useful in searching for substances that can intervene in the subunit association, which is attractive as a target to neutralize the virulence of SARS coronavirus.","Chou, Chi-Yuan; Chang, Hui-Chuan; Hsu, Wen-Chi; Lin, Tien-Zheng; Lin, Chao-Hsiung; Chang, Gu-Gang",Biochemistry,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15554703/,344

Methods Data of paediatric surgical emergencies during March-May 2019 and March-May 2020 was collected from database of the paediatric surgical department of Khyber Teaching Hospital Peshawar and two groups were constituted, i.e., Pre COVID and COVID groups respectively. These two groups were compared for the number of emergency admissions, the number of emergency surgeries, complications at the time of presentation and surgical treatment given. Data were analysed in SPSS version-22 and p-value after Yates correction was generated were necessary to see if the difference was statistically significant (p<0.05). Results There were 47.8% fewer emergency admissions and a 77.45% reduction in the number of emergency surgeries done in COVID time as compared to the Pre COVID time. Similarly, the number of perforated appendicitis and complicated intestinal obstruction was significantly higher than expected in COVID group.

201025,Virtual laboratory lessons in enzymology,2020,"BACKGROUND Laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) is gaining credibility as a simple and efficient bariatric procedure with low surgical risk. Since surgical treatment for morbid obesity is relatively rare in adolescents, few results have bten accumulated so far. OBJECTIVES To prove the safety and efficacy of LSG turgery in an adolescent population METHODS Data were prospectively collected regarding adolescent patients undergoing LSG. All patients underwent pre- and postoperative medical and professional evaluation by a multidisciplinary team. RESULTS Between the years 2006 and 2011, 32 adolescents underwent LSG in our center (20 females and 12males). Mean age was 16.75 years (range 14-18 years), mean weight was 121.88 kg (83-178 kg), and mean body mass index 43.23 (35-54). Thirty-four comorbid conditions were identified. LSG was the primary bariatric procedure in all the patients. Mean operative time was 60 minutes (range 45-80 min). Tiere were two complications (6.25%): an early staple line leak and a late acute cholecystitis. There were no deaths. Mean percent excess weight loss at 1, 3, 6, 9,12, 24, 36, 48, and 60 months post-surgery was 27.9%, 41.1%, 62.6%, 79.2%, 81.7%, 71%, 75%, 102.9% and 101.6%, respectively. Comorbidities were completely resolved or ameliorated within 1 year folllowing surgery in 82.4% and 17.6%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS LSG is feasible and safe in morbidly obese adolescents, achieving efficient weight loss and impressive resolution of comorbidities. Further studies are required to evaluate the long-term results of this procedure as well as its place among other bariatric options.","Raziel, Asnat; Sakran, Nasser; Szold, Amir; Teshuva, Ofir; Krakovsky, Mirit; Rabau, Oded; Goitein, David",The Israel Medical Association journal : IMAJ,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24575503/,344

202355,From the Editor's Desk,2020,"Societies change through time, entailing changes in behaviors and institutions. We ask how social change occurs when behaviors and institutions are interdependent. We model a group-structured society in which the transmission of individual behavior occurs in parallel with the selection of group-level institutions. We consider a cooperative behavior that generates collective benefits for groups but does not spread between individuals on its own. Groups exhibit institutions that increase the diffusion of the behavior within the group, but also incur a group cost. Groups adopt institutions in proportion to their fitness. Finally, cooperative behavior may also spread globally. As expected, we find that cooperation and institutions are mutually reinforcing. But the model also generates behavioral source-sink dynamics when cooperation generated in institutional groups spreads to non-institutional groups, boosting their fitness. Consequently, the global diffusion of cooperation creates a pattern of institutional free-riding that limits the evolution of group-beneficial institutions. Our model suggests that, in a group-structured society, large-scale change in behavior and institutions (i.e. social change) can be best achieved when the two remain correlated, such as through the spread successful pilot programs.","H'ebert-Dufresne, Laurent; Waring, Timothy M.; St-Onge, Guillaume; Niles, Meredith T.; Corlew, Laura Kati; Dube, Matthew P.; Miller, Stephanie J.; Gotelli, Nicholas; McGill, Brian J.",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2109.08106v1.pdf,344

Here we introduce the inter-layer mutual confirmation mechanism into the information-disease interacting dynamics on multiplex networks. In our model, an individual increases the information transmission rate and willingness to adopt protective measures once he confirms the authenticity of news and severity of disease from neighbors status in multiple layers. By using the microscopic Markov chain approach, we analytically calculate the epidemic threshold and the awareness and infected density in the stationary state, which agree well with simulation results. We find that the increment of epidemic threshold when confirming the aware neighbors on communication layer is larger than that of the contact layer. On the contrary, the confirmation of neighbors' awareness and infection from the contact layer leads to a lower final infection density and a higher awareness density than that of the communication layer. The results imply that individuals' explicit exposure of their infection and awareness status to neighbors, especially those with real contacts, is helpful in suppressing epidemic spreading.","Chen, Jiaxing; Liu, Ying; Tang, Ming; Yue, Jing",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.01340v1.pdf,344

The aim of the present study is to summarize all the available information about the implementation of physical therapy management in critically ill patients. From three clinical guidelines already published, we performed a search in PubMed, Scopus, ScienceDirect, and CINAHL, including systematic reviews, clinical guidelines, and randomized controlled trials, among others. Data extraction was performed independently by two reviewers. Quality assessment was developed through the AMSTAR-2 tool and PEDro Scale. A narrative synthesis was performed and 29 studies were included. The information extracted has been classified into four folders: ICU environment in COVID-19 (security aspects and management of the patient), respiratory physiotherapy (general indications and contraindications, spontaneously breathing and mechanically ventilated patient approaches), positional treatment, and exercise therapy (safety aspects and progression). The implementation of physiotherapy in patients affected with COVID-19 admitted to the ICU is a necessary strategy that prevents complications and contributes to the stabilization of patients in critical periods, facilitating their recovery.","Bernal-Utrera, Carlos; Anarte-Lazo, Ernesto; Gonzalez-Gerez, Juan Jose; De-La-Barrera-Aranda, Elena; Saavedra-Hernandez, Manuel; Rodriguez-Blanco, Cleofas",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,344

Yet Italy and Spain were the first European countries hit by the coronavirus and did not have the benefit of hindsight and policy learning. A further complication for crisis management and associated policy measures to be adopted and implemented was the highly decentralized policy system. The article analyzes the main policy responses by national governments in Italy and Spain, focusing on their innovative character and on the coordination challenge of these measures for central–regional multilevel governance. The findings suggest that central governments assuming emergency powers need to balance more carefully their policy decisions against the constitutional shared responsibilities acquired by regional governments in highly decentralized policy systems.

This article formulates hypotheses about the reasons of such attitudes among faculty members and provides arguments for possible opinion shifts and alleviation of resistance to technological change. The paramount problem consists in the contradiction between the acceptance of the idea and value of digital innovation and the rejection of such at the level of personal teaching practices. During expert interviews, faculty members were offered alternative scenarios of the future. The data obtained was then used to analyze the attitudes and beliefs behind their resistance and to find out which perceptions of the future correlated with negative and positive evaluations of distance learning. © 2011, Mir Rossii All Rights Reserved.","Rogozin, D.",Mir Rossii,,344

Further, stages of disease theory suggests that disparities may grow as the pandemic unfolds and more advantaged areas are better able to apply growing knowledge and mitigation strategies. In this paper, we focus on the role of county-level household overcrowding on disparities in COVID-19 mortality in U.S. counties. We examine this relationship across three theoretically important periods of the pandemic from April–October 2020, that mark both separate stages of community knowledge and national mortality levels. We find evidence that the percentage of overcrowded households is a stronger predictor of COVID-19 mortality during later periods of the pandemic. Moreover, despite a relationship between overcrowding and poverty at the county-level, overcrowding plays an independent role in predicting COVID-19 mortality. Our findings underscore that areas disadvantaged by overcrowding may be more vulnerable to the effects of COVID-19 and that this vulnerability may lead to changing disparities over time.","Kamis, Christina Stolte Allison West Jessica S.; Fishman, Samuel H.; Brown, Taylor Brown Tyson Farmer Heather R.",SSM - Population Health,,344

208816,Is sugar extracted from plants less healthy than sugar consumed within plant tissues? The sugar anomaly,2020,"BACKGROUND: Varicella-zoster virus (VZV) infects and establishes latency in neurons in the ganglia of the cranial nerve, dorsal root and enteric ganglia. VZV reactivation in enteric neurons (enteric zoster) can cause non-specific abdominal pain and/or serious gastrointestinal dysfunction without cutaneous manifestations. Detection of VZV DNA in saliva may be useful for identifying enteric zoster. We evaluated the frequency of putative enteric zoster based on the presence of salivary VZV DNA in patients with acute abdominal pain. METHODS: Adult patients who visited the emergency room due to moderate to severe acute abdominal pain were prospectively enrolled at a tertiary hospital between May 2019 and November 2019. Abdominopelvic computed tomography (APCT) was performed in all patients. We also evaluated the presence of salivary VZV DNA in patients with confirmed coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) who were under stressful conditions. Saliva samples were collected from all studied patients. Enteric zoster was suspected based on the presence of salivary VZV DNA, detected using real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). RESULTS: Fifty patients with moderate to severe abdominal pain were enrolled. Five of 50 patients exhibited positive VZV-DNA PCR results. APCT revealed that among these five patients, two had pancreatic head cancer, two had small bowel obstruction after intra-abdominal surgery, and one had no remarkable findings. However, all 14 patients with COVID-19 showed negative salivary VZV-DNA PCR results. CONCLUSIONS: Approximately 10% of patients with moderate to severe acute abdominal pain showed positivity for salivary VZV DNA. Further studies are warranted on whether antiviral therapy based on salivary VZV-DNA PCR results may relieve abdominal pain in the studied patient population.

213768,Plasma-Spende von Rekonvaleszenten als Therapie bei COVID-19: Studien laufen,2020,"The COVID-19 pandemic has emerged as a public health crisis and has placed a significant burden on healthcare systems. Patients with underlying metabolic dysfunction, such as type 2 diabetes mellitus and obesity, are at a higher risk for COVID-19 complications, including multi-organ dysfunction, secondary to a deranged immune response, and cellular energy deprivation. These patients are at a baseline state of chronic inflammation associated with increased susceptibility to the severe immune manifestations of COVID-19, which are triggered by the cellular hypoxic environment and cytokine storm. The altered metabolic profile and energy generation of immune cells affect their activation, exacerbating the imbalanced immune response. Key immunometabolic interactions may inform the development of an efficacious treatment for COVID-19. Novel therapeutic approaches with repurposed drugs, such as PPAR agonists, or newly developed molecules such as the antagomirs, which block microRNA function, have shown promising results. Those treatments, alone or in combination, target both immune and metabolic pathways and are ideal for septic COVID-19 patients with an underlying metabolic condition.","Batabyal, Rachael; Freishtat, Nathaniel; Hill, Elaise; Rehman, Muhammad; Freishtat, Robert; Koutroulis, Ioannis",Int J Obes (Lond),,344
214820,Our future in the Anthropocene biosphere,2021,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has developed into a serious pandemic with millions of cases diagnosed worldwide. To fight COVID-19 pandemic, over 100 countries instituted either a full or partial lockdown, affecting billions of people. In Tyrol, first lockdown measures were taken on 10 March 2020. On 16 March 2020, a curfew went into force which ended on 1 May 2020. On 19 March 2020, Tyrol as a whole was placed in quarantine which ended on 7 April 2020. The governmental actions helped reducing the spread of COVID-19 at the cost of significant effects on social life and behaviour. Accordingly, to provide a comprehensive picture of the population health status not only input from medical and biological sciences is required, but also from other sciences able to provide lifestyle information such as drug use. Herein, wastewater-based epidemiology was used for studying temporal trends of licit and illicit drug consumption during lockdown and quarantine in the area of the Tyrolean capital Innsbruck (174,000 inhabitants). On 35 days between 12 March 2020 and 15 April 2020, loads of 23 markers were monitored in wastewater. Loads determined on 292 days between March 2016 and January 2020 served as reference. During lockdown, changes in the consumption patterns of recreational drugs (i.e. cocaine, amphetamine, 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine, methamphetamine, and alcohol) and pharmaceuticals for short-term application (i.e. acetaminophen, codeine, and trimethoprim) were detected. For illicit drugs and alcohol, it is very likely that observed changes were linked to the shutdown of the hospitality industry and event cancelation which led to a reduced demand of these compounds particularly on weekends.

Spain is among the most affected countries. Our aim is to describe the cases of COVID-19 at Infanta Sofía University Hospital (Madrid), a public secondary hospital that increased its hospital beds to provide assistance during the outbreak. METHODS: Retrospective descriptive study of cases that met COVID-19 clinical diagnosis criteria or had a positive PCR test from February 27 to June 29, 2020. A description of demographic variables, hospital stay, mortality and the epidemiological curve was performed. RESULTS: Of 1,828 confirmed cases, 64.4% were hospitalised, 5.6% were admitted to the ICU. About 52.2% were male. The median age was 63.2 years. About 13.1% were nursing home residents. Nineteen percent were of Latin American origin of which 6.8% were admitted to the ICU. Overall case fatality was 14.6%. We observed a biphasic epidemiological curve. CONCLUSIONS: Sixty to 79-year-old males were admitted and deceased more often than women. Mortality reached 14.7%. Latin Americans were admitted more often to the ICU.

218592,Capacity Evaluation of Diagnostic Tests For COVID-19 Using Multicriteria Decision-Making Techniques,2020,"NEW FINDINGS: What is the topic of this review? Lactate is considered an important substrate for mitochondria in the muscles, heart and brain during exercise and is the main gluconeogenetic precursor in the liver and kidneys. In this light, we review the (patho)physiology of lactate metabolism in sepsis and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). What advances does it highlight? Elevated blood lactate is strongly associated with mortality in septic patients. Lactate seems unrelated to tissue hypoxia but is likely to reflect mitochondrial dysfunction and high adrenergic stimulation. Patients with severe COVID-19 exhibit near-normal blood lactate, indicating preserved mitochondrial function, despite a systemic hyperinflammatory state similar to sepsis. ABSTRACT: In critically ill patients, elevated plasma lactate is often interpreted as a sign of organ hypoperfusion and/or tissue hypoxia. This view on lactate is likely to have been influenced by the pioneering exercise physiologists around 1920. August Krogh identified an oxygen deficit at the onset of exercise that was later related to an oxygen 'debt' and lactate accumulation by A. V. Hill. Lactate is considered to be the main gluconeogenetic precursor in the liver and kidneys during submaximal exercise, but hepatic elimination is attenuated by splanchnic vasoconstriction during high-intensity exercise, causing an exponential increase in blood lactate. With the development of stable isotope tracers, lactate has become established as an important energy source for muscle, brain and heart tissue, where it is used for mitochondrial respiration. Plasma lactate > 4 mM is strongly associated with mortality in septic shock, with no direct link between lactate release and tissue hypoxia. Herein, we provide evidence for mitochondrial dysfunction and adrenergic stimulation as explanations for the sepsis-induced hyperlactataemia. Despite profound hypoxaemia and intense work of breathing, patients with severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) rarely exhibit hyperlactataemia (> 2.5 mM), while presenting a systemic hyperinflammatory state much like sepsis. However, lactate dehydrogenase, which controls the formation of lactate, is markedly elevated in plasma and strongly associated with mortality in severe COVID-19. We briefly review the potential mechanisms of the lactate dehydrogenase elevation in COVID-19 and its relationship to lactate metabolism based on mechanisms established in contracting skeletal muscle and the acute respiratory distress syndrome.","Iepsen, Ulrik Winning; Plovsing, Ronni R; Tjelle, Klaus; Foss, Nicolai Bang; Meyhoff, Christian S; Ryrsø, Camilla K; Berg, Ronan M G; Secher, Niels H",Exp. physiol,,344
219231,Hybrid TODIM Method with Crisp Number and Probability Linguistic Term Set for Urban Epidemic Situation Evaluation,2020,"OBJECTIVE AND BACKGROUND: The current scenario of the Pandemic of COVID-19 demands multi-channel investigations and predictions. A variety of prediction models are available in the literature. The majority of these models are based on extrapolating by the parameters related to the diseases, which are history-oriented. Instead, the current research is designed to predict the mortality rate of COVID-19 by Regression techniques in comparison to the models followed by five countries. METHODS: The Regression method with an optimized hyper-parameter is used to develop these models under training data by Machine Learning Technique. RESULTS: The validity of the proposed model is endorsed by considering the case study on the data for Pakistan. Five distinct models for mortality rate prediction are built using Confirmed cases data as a predictor variable for France, Spain, Turkey, Sweden, and Pakistan, respectively. The results evidenced that Sweden has a fewer death case over 20,000 confirmed cases without observing lockdown. Hence, by following the strategy adopted by Sweden, the chosen entity will control the death rate despite the increase of the confirmed cases. CONCLUSION: The evaluated results notice the high mortality rate and low RMSE for Pakistan by the GPR method based Mortality model. Therefore, the morality rate based MRP model is selected for the COVID-19 death rate in Pakistan. Hence, the best-fit is the Sweden model to control the mortality rate.","Khan, Y A; Abbas, S Z; Truong, Buu-Chau",Comput Methods Programs Biomed,,344

221287,Resolving Roadblocks to Activating Additional Physicians,2020,"INTRODUCTION: Mentored clinical practice is central to demonstrating achievement of International Educational Standards in advanced musculoskeletal physical therapy. While traditionally delivered face-to-face, telehealth e-mentoring is a novel alternative to offering this unique pedagogy to facilitate mentee critical reflection, deeper learning and enhanced knowledge translation to optimise patient care. With COVID-19 resulting in widespread adoption of telehealth and access to mentors often limited by geography or cost, the potential value of telehealth e-mentoring needs investigating. To investigate the experiences and outcomes of multiple stakeholders (student mentees, mentors and patients) engaged in musculoskeletal physical therapy telehealth e-mentoring across two universities (UK and Canada). METHODS AND ANALYSIS: Using case study design, we will use sequential mixed methods involving qualitative and quantitative components based on existing evidence. To examine the influence of telehealth e-mentoring on health outcomes in patients with musculoskeletal complaints, we will use patient-reported outcomes for satisfaction, patient empowerment and change in musculoskeletal health. We will conduct semistructured interviews to explore the development of critical thinking, clinical reasoning, communication skills and confidence of students engaged in telehealth e-mentoring. To explore the mentor acceptability and appropriateness of telehealth e-mentoring, we will conduct a focus group in each site. Finally, we will include a focus group of participants from each site to allow a cross-cultural comparison of findings to inform international stakeholders. Quantitative data will be analysed using descriptive statistics (median and IQR) to describe changes in outcome data and qualitative data will be analysed following the Framework Method. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This study has ethical approval from both institutions: the University of Birmingham (ERN_20-0695) and Western University (2020-116233-47832). Findings will be published in a peer-reviewed journal and disseminated to key stakeholders in musculoskeletal physical therapy education and practice.","Heneghan, Nicola R; Nazareth, Madeleine; Johnson, Wendy J; Tyros, Isaak; Sadi, Jackie; Gillis, Heather; Rushton, Alison B",BMJ Open,,344

As the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) ravages the world, we have seen many perish in a short time. Many have died alone because of requirements for physical distancing. Even more will succumb as COVID-19 continues to spread. Moreover, deaths from other causes, numbering over 50 million annually, are also happening amid physical distancing and other COVID-19-related challenges. The pandemic is affecting the way terminally ill patients are being cared for, when and how people are dying of other causes, and how bodies are being handled and bereavement rituals performed. The bereaved are required to grieve without the support of usual social and cultural rituals. Grieving is further encumbered by cascading life stressors deriving from policies needed to mitigate the pandemic. Though we are often heartened by human resilience in response to death and other hardships, for some, the burden of this pandemic will be too much. Among other mental health problems, we will likely see an increase in prolonged grief disorder. In this commentary, we review the new diagnosis of prolonged grief disorder and outline why we might anticipate increased rates of this condition on the heels of COVID-19, especially among older persons. The authors suggest ways that might mitigate this emerging problem.","Goveas, Joseph S; Shear, M Katherine",Am J Geriatr Psychiatry,,344
221804,Theory of the Spread of Epidemics and Movement Ecology of Animals: An Interdisciplinary Approach using Methodologies of Physics and Mathematics,,"Given the most recent epidemiological data and in view of the increasing spread of the Sars-CoV-2 virus in society as a whole and the world of sport in particular, the following medical and health recommendations are proposed to implement the FIGC regulations, approved by the CTS and already in place for professional soccer and the LEGA Serie A, in order to: 1) protect the health of individual players and the team group and reduce the risk of contracting the Sars-CoV-2 virus for all members and employees of Serie A Clubs by means of periodic and preventive monitoring;2) reduce the spread of the virus from within the group to the general public, by taking social responsibility;and 3) standardize management of the testing, transport, analysis and reporting process of the system. In order to pursue these objectives and optimize the recommendations set out below, it is necessary: 1) to identify a single company/ central laboratory to contact in order to guarantee a consistent method in the management of the testing, transport, analysis and reporting processes of molecular swabs (PCR). All Serie A clubs shall refer to this company/central laboratory, recognizing its exclusive status for the execution of such processes;2) to identify a contact authority available 24h (with dedicated email and telephone) within Serie A for the coordination and management of every need and/or emergency;3) for the Ministry of Health to activate a contact figure to coordinate and oversee each local ATS/ASL so as to guarantee that clubs receive uniform indications and provisions and to act as interface for the entire professional system. This central figure will delegate the management of everyday business to the various local ATS/ASLs, receiving constant, up-to-date feedback;and 4) to urge the Ministry of Health to adopt uniform procedures within the National Health System (local ATS/ASLs) in matters of management of players who test positive a second time after announcing their recovery and management of players who, in contact quarantine, are called up to the national team or who return from it. The FMSI may also make its DCOs available, as an opportunity to be agreed with the FIGC and the AIA, to perform rapid antigen tests on the refereeing group 2 hours before a game. The following recommendations are subject to review considering new scientific and epidemiological evidence.

221932,Assessment of the burden on population due to transport-related air pollution: The Czech core motorway network,2020,"In the coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) era, point-of-care lung ultrasound (LUS) has attracted increased attention. Prospective studies on LUS for the assessment of pneumonia in adult patients were extensively carried out for more than 10 years before this era. None of these prospective studies attempted to differentiate bacterial and viral pneumonia in adult patients using LUS. The majority of studies considered the LUS examination to be positive if sonographic consolidations or multiple B-lines were observed. Significant differences existed in the accuracy of these studies. Some studies revealed that LUS showed superior sensitivity to chest X-ray. These results indicate that point-of-care LUS has the potential to be an initial imaging modality for the diagnosis of pneumonia. The LUS diagnosis of ventilator-associated pneumonia in intensive care units is more challenging in comparison with the diagnosis of community-acquired pneumonia in emergency departments due to the limited access to the mechanically ventilated patients and the high prevalence of atelectasis. However, several studies have demonstrated that the combination of LUS findings with other clinical markers improved the diagnostic accuracy. In the COVID-19 era, many case reports and small observational studies on COVID-19 pneumonia have been published in a short period. Multiple B-lines were the most common and consistent finding in COVID-19 pneumonia. Serial LUS showed the deterioration of the disease. The knowledge and ideas on the application of LUS in the management of pneumonia that are expected to accumulate in the COVID-19 era may provide us with clues regarding more appropriate management.","Kameda, Toru; Mizuma, Yoshihiro; Taniguchi, Hayato; Fujita, Masato; Taniguchi, Nobuyuki",J Med Ultrason (2001),,344

223235,Back2Future: Leveraging Backfill Dynamics for Improving Real-time Predictions in Future,2021-06-08,"BACKGROUND: A key question concerning coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is how effective and long lasting immunity against this disease is in individuals who were previously infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). We aimed to evaluate the risk of SARS-CoV-2 re-infections in the general population in Austria. METHODS: This is a retrospective observational study using national SARS-CoV-2 infection data from the Austrian epidemiological reporting system. As the primary outcome, we aim to compare the odds of SARS-CoV-2 re-infections of COVID-19 survivors of the first wave (February to April 30, 2020) versus the odds of first infections in the remainder general population by tracking polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-confirmed infections of both groups during the second wave from September 1 to November 30, 2020. Re-infection counts are tentative, since it cannot be excluded that the positive PCR in the first and/or second wave might have been a false positive. RESULTS: We recorded 40 tentative re-infections in 14 840 COVID-19 survivors of the first wave (0.27%) and 253 581 infections in 8 885 640 individuals of the remaining general population (2.85%) translating into an odds ratio (95% confidence interval) of 0.09 (0.07 to 0.13). CONCLUSIONS: We observed a relatively low re-infection rate of SARS-CoV-2 in Austria. Protection against SARS-CoV-2 after natural infection is comparable with the highest available estimates on vaccine efficacies. Further well-designed research on this issue is urgently needed for improving evidence-based decisions on public health measures and vaccination strategies.","Pilz, Stefan; Chakeri, Ali; Ioannidis, John Pa; Richter, Lukas; Theiler-Schwetz, Verena; Trummer, Christian; Krause, Robert; Allerberger, Franz",Eur J Clin Invest,,344
223255,Editorial Volume 17,2021,"The coronavirus pandemic, which has numerous global implications, has led people to believe that nothing will be the same as before. The present day is dominated by studies on determining the factors that affect, taking preventive actions, and trying to find an effective treatment on top priority. Meteorological parameters are among the crucial factors affecting infectious diseases. The present study examines the correlation between weather and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) by considering nine cities in Turkey. In this regard, temperature (°C), dew point (°C), humidity (%), and wind speed (mph) are considered as parameters of weather. Research states that the incubation period of COVID-19 varies from 1â¯day to 14â¯days. Therefore, the effects of each parameter within 1, 3, 7, and 14â¯days are examined. In addition, the population is included as an effective parameter for evaluation. The analyses are conducted based on Spearman's correlation coefficients. The results showed that the highest correlations were observed for population, wind speed 14â¯days ago, and temperature on the day, respectively.

223938,The coronavirus pandemic as an analogy for future sustainability challenges,2020,"The mutations in the SARS-CoV-2 virus genome during COVID-19 dissemination are unclear. In 788 COVID-19 patients from Zhejiang province, we observed decreased rate of severe/critical cases compared with patients in Wuhan. For mechanisms exploration, we isolated one strain of SARS-CoV-2 (ZJ01) from a mild COVID-19 patient. Thirty-five specific gene mutations were identified. Phylogenetic and relative synonymous codon usage analysis suggested that ZJ01 may be a potential evolutionary branch of SARS-CoV-2. We classified 54 global virus strains based on the base (C or T) at positions 8824 and 28247 while ZJ01 has T at both sites. The prediction of the Furin cleavage site (FCS) and sequence alignment indicated that the FCS may be an important site of coronavirus evolution. ZJ01 mutations identified near the FCS (F1-2) caused changes in the structure and electrostatic distribution of the S surface protein, further affecting the binding capacity of Furin. Single-cell sequencing and ACE2-Furin co-expression results confirmed that the Furin expression was especially higher in glands, liver, kidneys, and colon. The evolutionary pattern of SARS-CoV-2 towards FCS formation may result in its clinical symptom becoming closer to HKU-1 and OC43 caused mild flu-like symptoms, further showing its potential in differentiating into mild COVID-19 subtypes.","Jin, Xi; Xu, Kangli; Jiang, Penglei; Lian, Jiangshan; Hao, Shaorui; Yao, Hangping; Jia, Hongyu; Zhang, Yimin; Zheng, Lin; Zheng, Nuoheng; Chen, Dong; Yao, Jinmei; Hu, Jianhua; Gao, Jianguo; Wen, Liang; Shen, Jian; Ren, Yue; Yu, Guodong; Wang, Xiaoyan; Lu, Yingfeng; Yu, Xiaopeng; Yu, Liang; Xiang, Dairong; Wu, Nanping; Lu, Xiangyun; Cheng, Linfang; Liu, Fumin; Wu, Haibo; Jin, Changzhong; Yang, Xiaofeng; Qian, Pengxu; Qiu, Yunqing; Sheng, Jifang; Liang, Tingbo; Li, Lanjuan; Yang, Yida",Emerg Microbes Infect,,344
223985,"Artificial Intelligence: Promise, Pitfalls, and Perspective",2020,"The world is experiencing an ongoing pandemic of coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19), which is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). In attempts to control the pandemic, a range of nonpharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) has been implemented worldwide. However, the effect of synchronized NPIs for the control of COVID-19 at temporal and spatial scales has not been well studied. Therefore, a meta-population model that incorporates essential nonlinear processes was constructed to uncover the transmission characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 and then assess the effectiveness of synchronized NPIs on COVID-19 dynamics in China. Regional synchronization of NPIs was observed in China, and it was found that a combination of synchronized NPIs (the travel restrictions, the social distancing and the infection isolation) prevented 93.7% of SARS-CoV-2 infections. The use of synchronized NPIs at the time of the Wuhan lockdown may have prevented as much as 38% of SARS-CoV-2 infections, compared with the unsynchronized scenario. The interconnectivity of the epicenter, the implementation time of synchronized NPIs, and the number of regions considered all affected the performance of synchronized NPIs. The results highlight the importance of using synchronized NPIs in high-risk regions for the control of COVID-19 and shed light on effective strategies for future pandemic responses.

The inability to attend scientific meetings has far-reaching implications for our field, as we lose the ability to 1) disseminate both published and non-published data through talks and posters; 2) network and establish new collaborations to produce innovative science in the aging field; and 3) continue the career development of early career researchers (ECRs). Through these virtual seminars, we hope to offset the negative effects of these canceled meetings. We established the program rapidly using a “lean” approach, making use of existing technologies broadly available at academic institutions. Here, we provide an initial description of how this program was developed and implemented. We discuss advantages and limitations of this approach, including “real-time” participation and the creation of an on/off-line community of inquiry (CoI). In the future, we hope to formally evaluate the success of this program in building engagement, creating a community, and enhancing the development of ECRs, and to capture metrics associated with the continued progress of science. Our approach to building a CoI may be applied across multiple scientific disciplines during this time of uncertainty, and may offer a valuable example of how to continue to advance science during pandemics or similar events.","Lamming, Dudley W.; Carter, Christy S.",Transl.

Two large samples of the French population were classified on the basis of their depressive symptoms and completed an online questionnaire on their emotions and their behaviors during the lockdown. Results showed that, compared to participants with no or mild mental health-related symptoms, participants with moderate to severe depressive symptoms suffered from greater psychological effects of the pandemic and the lockdown (fear, anxiety, sadness, sleep quality, loss of daily routine). However, health risk behaviors (smoking, drinking, non-compliance with lockdown and barrier gestures) and perceived vulnerability did not differ between the participant groups, although more severely depressed participants tended to be less respectful of health guidelines. In addition, the most heightened effects on the depressed participants were boredom and the feeling of social isolation, which was not compensated by the search for social affiliation. Supporting people with depression should be a public health priority because they suffer psychologically more than others from the pandemic and the lockdown.","Martinelli, Natalia; Gil, Sandrine; Chevalère, Johann; Belletier, Clément; Dezecache, Guillaume; Huguet, Pascal; Droit-Volet, Sylvie",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,344

227363,Preventing and Controlling Epidemics through Blockchain-Assisted AI-Enabled Networks,2021-04-25,"Due to the circumstances associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, the academic year 2020 represented a challenge for engineering education around the world. In Guatemala, the first case of COVID-19 was reported on Friday, March 13, 2020, and as a consequence, all higher-level educational institutions were closed. Before the pandemic, in Universidad Galileo, all of the different engineering mathematics courses were taught traditionally following a face-to-face format. As a result, the pandemics' challenge consists of, not only the fact of having to transform the teaching and learning format but also in making the transition in the shortest amount of time possible. During the pandemic, the class sessions continued with the schedule established at the beginning of the semester, but with the help of video conferencing tools. It is important to mention that we used a set of distance teaching tools and techniques that help us fulfilling the main objective of the course: students' learning while enhancing their motivation. A test designed specifically for the pandemic situation was used to measure the students' motivation. Such a test includes sub-scales associated with the students' feelings about the current situation and it also assesses the course structure, flexibility, and content delivery in the virtual format.

228973,Correlated Oxide Dirac Semimetal in the Extreme Quantum Limit,2021-08-18,"There have been over 17 million COVID-19 infections worldwide up to July 31, 2020, but the exact transmission route remains a subject for debate Virus load in different-sized respiratory droplets is the key to address the above question Investigation on the droplet deposition characteristics during exhalation inside the respiratory tract will facilitate the understanding of their origin and importance in transmitting the respiratory infection Based on a realistic respiratory model, this study utilized the computational fluid dynamic (CFD) simulation to investigate the deposition of droplets originating from infection sites like pharynx, larynx and trachea under three flow conditions, namely 30 L/min (representing the normal breathing condition), 60 L/min (speaking) and 180 L/min (coughing) The SST k-ω turbulence model integrated in ANSYS Fluent software was utilized to obtain the flow field inside the respiratory tract by solving the continuity and momentum equations, and the Lagrangian approach was used to calculate droplet motion and deposition with the discrete random walk model to account for the turbulence fluctuation effect Evaporation of droplets was not considered inside the saturated respiratory tract Droplet diameter, flow rate of the exhaling air, and complexity of the respiratory tract geometry are the most important factors in determining the deposition pattern of respiratory droplets It is revealed that the largest droplet that originates from the joint of pharynx and larynx and is able to escape out of the respiratory tract is about 20 µm (30 L/min) or 10 µm(60-180 L/min) in diameter;the so-called cut-off sizes for vocal cord and trachea originated droplets are 7 µm (30 L/min), 5 µm (60 L/min) or 3 µm (180 L/min) Larynx and joint of larynx and pharynx are the most important deposition sites due to their complexity in geometry and the existence of the laryngeal jet, whose velocity is up to 102 m/s during coughing and32 m/s during speaking;the nasal cavity is also effective in trapping relatively small droplets as the airflow has a sudden change in direction before entering the oral cavity Under the investigated speaking scenario (60 L/min), the escape rate of1 µm droplets is around 50%, and the maximum escape rates of 5 and 10 µm droplets are respectively 13 1% and 1 3% (originating from the joint of pharynx and larynx) Although large droplets up to several hundred micrometers can be produced inside the oral cavity due to the atomization mechanism, they seldom carry pathogen Thus, for COVID-19 patents in the early stage of infection who show upper respiratory symptoms, the cut-off size of virus-laden droplets released into the environment is about 20 µm;with the shifting of infection to the lower respiratory tract in the later stage, the cut-off size decreases to 7 µm Respiratory droplets evaporate immediately after escaping into the indoor environments and shrink to about one third of their initial size, so airborne route is speculated to be important in the transmission of COVID-19 Further investigations considering realistic flow conditions together with droplet sampling experiments on human volunteers are necessary to confirm these cut-off sizes © 2021, Science Press All right reserved","Wei, J.; Guo, Y.; Lei, H.; Wang, L.; Jin, T.; Tang, L.",Kexue Tongbao/Chinese Science Bulletin,,344
229147,A secure remote health monitoring model for early disease diagnosis in cloud-based IoT environment,2020,"BACKGROUND: Several pharmacological agents, such as chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine, have been promoted for COVID-19 treatment or pre-exposure prophylaxis. However, no comprehensive evaluation of the safety of these possible agents is available, and is urgently needed. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to investigate the risks of cardiac adverse events associated with the possible pharmacotherapies for COVID-19, including certain antimalarial, antiviral, and antibiotic drugs. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We conduced retrospective pharmacovigilance analyses of the US Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System database. The reporting odds ratio (ROR), a data mining algorithm commonly used in pharmacovigilance assessment, was generated to quantify the detection signal of adverse events. RESULTS: Among individuals without coronavirus infection from 2015 Q1 to 2020 Q1, increased risks for cardiac disorders were found for antiviral agents such as chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine (ROR: 1.68; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.66-1.70), lopinavir/ritonavir (ROR: 1.52; 95% CI 1.39-1.66), and antibiotics such as azithromycin (ROR: 1.37; 95% CI 1.30-1.44) and ceftriaxone (ROR: 1.92; 95% CI 1.80-2.05). Increased serious cardiac adverse events, including myocardial infarction, arrhythmia, and cardiac arrest, were also reported for these drugs. Further analyses of individuals with coronavirus infections revealed that 40% of individuals receiving chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine reported serious cardiac adverse events. Two cases resulted in QT prolongations and one case resulted in cardiac arrest. Chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin contributed to all the QT prolongation and cardiac arrest cases. CONCLUSIONS: The current pharmacotherapies for COVID-19 are associated with increased risks of cardiac adverse events. Variations in the cardiac safety profiles of these pharmacotherapies were also observed. Clinicians should closely monitor patients with COVID-19, especially those at high risk, using chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin.","Yuan, Jing; Li, Minghui; Yu, Yiqun; Lee, Tai-Ying; Lv, Gang; Han, Bing; Xiang, Xiaoqiang; Lu, Z Kevin",,,344

The aim of this study is to assess the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on malaria transmission potential in malaria-endemic countries in Africa. METHODS: We present a data-driven method to quantify the extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as various non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs), could lead to the change of malaria transmission potential in 2020. First, we adopt a particle Markov Chain Monte Carlo method to estimate epidemiological parameters in each country by fitting the time series of the cumulative number of reported COVID-19 cases. Then, we simulate the epidemic dynamics of COVID-19 under two groups of NPIs: (1) contact restriction and social distancing, and (2) early identification and isolation of cases. Based on the simulated epidemic curves, we quantify the impact of COVID-19 epidemic and NPIs on the distribution of insecticide-treated nets (ITNs). Finally, by treating the total number of ITNs available in each country in 2020, we evaluate the negative effects of COVID-19 pandemic on malaria transmission potential based on the notion of vectorial capacity. RESULTS: We conduct case studies in four malaria-endemic countries, Ethiopia, Nigeria, Tanzania, and Zambia, in Africa. The epidemiological parameters (i.e., the basic reproduction number [Formula: see text] and the duration of infection [Formula: see text]) of COVID-19 in each country are estimated as follows: Ethiopia ([Formula: see text], [Formula: see text]), Nigeria ([Formula: see text], [Formula: see text]), Tanzania ([Formula: see text], [Formula: see text]), and Zambia ([Formula: see text], [Formula: see text]). Based on the estimated epidemiological parameters, the epidemic curves simulated under various NPIs indicated that the earlier the interventions are implemented, the better the epidemic is controlled. Moreover, the effect of combined NPIs is better than contact restriction and social distancing only. By treating the total number of ITNs available in each country in 2020 as a baseline, our results show that even with stringent NPIs, malaria transmission potential will remain higher than expected in the second half of 2020. CONCLUSIONS: By quantifying the impact of various NPI response to the COVID-19 pandemic on malaria transmission potential, this study provides a way to jointly address the syndemic between COVID-19 and malaria in malaria-endemic countries in Africa. The results suggest that the early intervention of COVID-19 can effectively reduce the scale of the epidemic and mitigate its impact on malaria transmission potential.","Shi, Benyun; Zheng, Jinxin; Xia, Shang; Lin, Shan; Wang, Xinyi; Liu, Yang; Zhou, Xiao-Nong; Liu, Jiming",Infect Dis Poverty,,344

However, creating training data for clinical entity tasks is time consuming and sharing labeled data is challenging due to privacy concerns. The information needs of the COVID-19 pandemic highlight the need for agile methods of training machine learning models for clinical notes. We present Trove, a framework for weakly supervised entity classification using medical ontologies and expert-generated rules. Our approach, unlike hand-labeled notes, is easy to share and modify, while offering performance comparable to learning from manually labeled training data.

In this article, we review the published literature and media reports to determine factors that may contribute to mental health challenges in persons with autoimmune disease. We then explore existing mental health interventions that have been developed for use in COVID-19 and in patients with autoimmune disorders in general. We identified several potential contributors to psychological distress in patients with autoimmune disease during the pandemic, as follows: feelings of discrimination related to societal response to COVID-19, fear of infection and uncertainty related to immunosuppressive medication, diminished access to usual care and resources, previous health-related trauma, and the exacerbating effect of social isolation. Drawing from existing literature, we synthesize the identified evidence to develop a proposed framework for researching and managing mental health challenges in autoimmune disease during the pandemic and its aftermath.","Bingham, Kathleen S; Rozenbojm, Nathalie; Chong-East, Mariah; Touma, Zahi",,,344

This study is aimed at discussing the blood transfusion status of West African countries in the pre-COVID-19 period and analyze the capacity to respond to the COVID-19 blood crisis, as well as to outline the panacea. METHODS: Secondary data were extracted from published reports, journal articles and web pages, reviewed and analyzed. RESULT: All the West African countries have recorded confirmed COVID-19 cases and deaths. The confirmed cases have reached 55,697, with 1069 deaths and a fatality rate of 1.9%, as of June 17, 2020. The assessed countries lagged in most of the WHO benchmarks for effective blood transfusion services. CONCLUSION: Blood transfusion services in the West African region lacked the basic benchmark practice and policy, are not coordinated and may find it hard to tackle the blood transfusion crisis created by the COVID-19 pandemic.","Okoroiwu, Henshaw Uchechi; Okafor, Ifeyinwa Maryann; Asemota, Enosakhare Aiyudubie; Ogar, Christopher Ogar; Uchendu, Ikenna Kingsley",,,344

In this study, we aimed to identify the risk factors for severe COVID-19 to improve treatment guidelines. METHODS: A multicenter, cross-sectional study was conducted on 313 patients hospitalized with COVID-19. Patients were classified into two groups based on disease severity (nonsevere and severe) according to initial clinical presentation. Laboratory test results and epidemiological and clinical characteristics were analyzed using descriptive statistics. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression models were used to detect potential risk factors associated with severe COVID-19. RESULTS: A total of 289 patients (197 nonsevere and 92 severe cases) with a median age of 45.0 (33.0, 61.0) years were included in this study, and 53.3% (154/289) were male. Fever (192/286, 67.1%) and cough (170/289, 58.8%) were commonly observed, followed by sore throat (49/289, 17.0%).

The general purpose of the present study was to assess the mental health of Italian healthcare workers during the COVID-19 outbreak and to identify high-risk groups. Here, we present results from the baseline assessment of the ""Healthcare workers' wellbeing (Benessere Operatori)"" project on a sample of 1055 healthcare workers. Participants completed the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale-21, the Insomnia Severity Index, the Impact of Event Scale-Revised, the State-Trait Anger Expression Inventory-2, and the Maslach Burnout Inventory. Healthcare workers who worked in COVID wards reported higher levels of anxiety, insomnia, post-traumatic stress, anger, and burnout, compared to those reported by the healthcare workers who worked in non-COVID wards. Moreover, nurses, both in COVID and non-COVID wards, were at higher risk of experiencing psychological distress compared to other groups of healthcare workers. These findings highlight the importance of implementing targeted psychological interventions for healthcare workers operating in COVID wards and nurses, who seem to be the most vulnerable categories.","Di Mattei, Valentina Elisabetta; Perego, Gaia; Milano, Francesca; Mazzetti, Martina; Taranto, Paola; Di Pierro, Rossella; De Panfilis, Chiara; Madeddu, Fabio; Preti, Emanuele",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,344
232476,A note from the editor-in-chief,2020,"Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an acute infectious disease caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Human SP-D (surfactant protein D) is known to interact with the spike protein of SARS-CoV, but its immune surveillance against SARS-CoV-2 is not known. The current study aimed to examine the potential of a recombinant fragment of human SP-D (rfhSP-D) as an inhibitor of replication and infection of SARS-CoV-2. The interaction of rfhSP-D with the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 and human ACE-2 (angiotensin-converting enzyme 2) receptor was predicted via docking analysis. The inhibition of interaction between the spike protein and ACE-2 by rfhSP-D was confirmed using direct and indirect ELISA. The effect of rfhSP-D on replication and infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 from clinical samples was assessed by measuring the expression of RdRp gene of the virus using quantitative PCR. In silico interaction studies indicated that three amino acid residues in the receptor-binding domain of spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 were commonly involved in interacting with rfhSP-D and ACE-2. Studies using clinical samples of SARS-CoV-2-positive cases (asymptomatic, n = 7; symptomatic, n = 8) and negative control samples (n = 15) demonstrated that treatment with 1.67 µM rfhSP-D inhibited viral replication by â¼5.5-fold and was more efficient than remdesivir (100 µM) in Vero cells. An approximately two-fold reduction in viral infectivity was also observed after treatment with 1.67 µM rfhSP-D. These results conclusively demonstrate that the rfhSP-D mediated calcium independent interaction between the receptor-binding domain of the S1 subunit of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and human ACE-2, its host cell receptor, and significantly reduced SARS-CoV-2 infection and replication in vitro.","Madan, Taruna; Biswas, Barnali; Varghese, Praveen M; Subedi, Rambhadur; Pandit, Hrishikesh; Idicula-Thomas, Susan; Kundu, Indra; Rooge, Sheetalnath; Agarwal, Reshu; Tripathi, Dinesh M; Kaur, Savneet; Gupta, Ekta; Gupta, Sanjeev K; Kishore, Uday",Am J Respir Cell Mol Biol,,344

Yet, the influences of control strategies on the transmission dynamics of COVID-19 are far from being well understood. In order to reveal the mechanisms of disease spread, we present dynamical models to show the propagation of COVID-19 in Wuhan. Based on mathematical analysis and data analysis, we systematically explore the effects of lockdown and medical resources on the COVID-19 transmission in Wuhan. It is found that the later lockdown is adopted by Wuhan, the fewer people will be infected in Wuhan, and nevertheless it will have an impact on other cities in China and even the world. Moreover, the richer the medical resources, the higher the peak of new infection, but the smaller the final scale. These findings well indicate that the control measures taken by the Chinese government are correct and timely.","Sun, Gui-Quan; Wang, Shi-Fu; Li, Ming-Tao; Li, Li; Zhang, Juan; Zhang, Wei; Jin, Zhen; Feng, Guo-Lin",Nonlinear Dyn,,344

Part I,2021-04-29,"In the present situation, COVID-19 has become the global health concern due to its high contagious nature. It initially appeared in December 2019 in Wuhan, China and now affected more than 190 countries. As of now preventive measures are the sole solution to stop this disease for further transmission from person to person transmissions as there is no effective treatment or vaccine available to date. Research and development of new molecule is a laborious process; therefore, drug repurposing can be an alternative solution that involves the identification of potential compounds from the already available data. Alkaloids are potential source of therapeutic agents which might be able to treat novel COVID-19. Therefore, in the present study, twenty potential alkaloid molecules that possess antiviral activity against different viral diseases have taken into consideration and scrutinized using Lipinski's rule. Then out of twenty compounds seventeen were further selected for docking study. Docking study was performed using Autodock software and the best four molecule which provides maximum negative binding energy was selected for further analysis. Two alkaloids namely thalimonine and sophaline D showed potential activity to inhibit the Mpro but to confirm the claim further in-vitro studies are required.","Garg, Saksham; Roy, Arpita",Chem Biol Interact,,344

The role of smoking habit in the susceptibility to infection is still controversial. In this study we correlated lung ACE-2 gene expression with several clinical/pathological data to explore susceptibility to infection. This is a retrospective observational study on 29 consecutive COVID-19 autopsies. SARS-CoV-2 genome and ACE-2 mRNA expression were evaluated by real-time polymerase chain reaction in lung tissue samples and correlated with several data with focus on smoking habit. Smoking was less frequent in high than low ACE-2 expressors (p = 0.014). A Bayesian regression also including age, gender, hypertension, and virus quantity confirmed that smoking was the most probable risk factor associated with low ACE-2 expression in the model. A direct relation was found between viral quantity and ACE-2 expression (p = 0.028). Finally, high ACE-2 expressors more frequently showed a prevalent pattern of vascular injury than low expressors (p = 0.049). In conclusion, ACE-2 levels were decreased in the lung tissue of smokers with severe COVID-19 pneumonia. These results point out complex biological interactions between SARS-CoV-2 and ACE-2 particularly concerning the aspect of smoking habit and need larger prospective case series and translational studies.","Lunardi, Francesca; Fortarezza, Francesco; Vedovelli, Luca; Pezzuto, Federica; Boscolo, Annalisa; Rossato, Marco; Vettor, Roberto; Cattelan, Anna Maria; Del Vecchio, Claudia; Crisanti, Andrea; Navalesi, Paolo; Gregori, Dario; Calabrese, Fiorella",Biomolecules,,344

O tratamento de escolha para a maioria dos casos é a utilização da radioidina. O hipotireoidismo iatrogênico contribui para indução de azotemia e diminuição da sobrevida. O presente estudo objetivou avaliar a ocorrência de hipotireoidismo um mês após o tratamento com iodo radioativo I131 em gatos hipertireoideos e de comparar os achados laboratoriais de acordo com os desfechos pós tratamento. Foi realizado estudo clínico retrospectivo longitudinal avaliando 85 prontuários de gatos hipertireoideos submetidos à terapia com iodo radioativo (I-131), com avaliação prévia e 30 dias após o tratamento. Os animais foram reclassificados perante o resultado da intervenção terapêutica de acordo com os valores séricos de T4 em hipotireoideo, eutireoideo e hipertireoideo. Dos 85 animais avaliados, 30 se tornaram eutireoideos, 31 hipotireoideos e 14 hipertireoideos. Isto é, cerca de 36% dos animais se tornaram hipotireoideos. Não houve associação entre o desfecho após o tratamento com o sexo (p=0,691), faixa etária (p=0,24), presença de tireoide palpável (p=0,833), peso prévio ao tratamento (p=0,127) e dose mCi/ animal (p=0,753). Porém, foi observada diferença estatisticamente significativa entre as médias da razão mCi/Kg entre eutireoideos e hipertireoideos, onde a média da razão mCi/Kg dos animais hipertireoideos foi significativamente maior do que a média dos eutireoideos. A média de creatinina antes do tratamento foi de 1,10 mg/dL e estatisticamente inferior à média após o mesmo (p<0,001). As mensurações realizadas previamente ao tratamento demonstraram creatinina inferior a 1,6 mg/dL em 82,4% dos animais, dado que alterou significativamente após a terapia em quase metade dos animais.

The efficient replication and population spread of SARS-CoV-2 indicates an effective evasion of human innate immune responses, although the viral proteins responsible for this immune evasion are not clear. In this study, we identified SARS-CoV-2 structural proteins, accessory proteins, and the main viral protease as potent inhibitors of host innate immune responses of distinct pathways. In particular, the main viral protease was a potent inhibitor of both the RLR and cGAS-STING pathways. Viral accessory protein ORF3a had the unique ability to inhibit STING, but not the RLR response. On the other hand, structural protein N was a unique RLR inhibitor. ORF3a bound STING in a unique fashion and blocked the nuclear accumulation of p65 to inhibit nuclear factor-&#954;B signaling. 3CL of SARS-CoV-2 inhibited K63-ubiquitin modification of STING to disrupt the assembly of the STING functional complex and downstream signaling. Diverse vertebrate STINGs, including those from humans, mice, and chickens, could be inhibited by ORF3a and 3CL of SARS-CoV-2. The existence of more effective innate immune suppressors in pathogenic coronaviruses may allow them to replicate more efficiently in vivo. Since evasion of host innate immune responses is essential for the survival of all viruses, our study provides insights into the design of therapeutic agents against SARS-CoV-2.","Rui, Yajuan; Su, Jiaming; Shen, Si; Hu, Ying; Huang, Dingbo; Zheng, Wenwen; Lou, Meng; Shi, Yifei; Wang, Meng; Chen, Shiqi; Zhao, Na; Dong, Qi; Cai, Yong; Xu, Rongzhen; Zheng, Shu; Yu, Xiao-Fang",Signal Transduct Target Ther,,344

METHODS: This is an observational cross-sectional study through an online questionnaire survey. A self-administered survey (PEF-COVID19) was applied in the Brazilian general population, age &#8805; 18 years. T-test for independent samples and Chi-square tests were used to compare Brazil and different macro-regions, pË0.05. RESULTS: 1,977 participants filled the survey and 1,845 were included; 80% of the included ones were in social isolation. In general, the self-related physical exercise practice before and during the COVID-19 pandemic and exercise characteristics were highly affected by the pandemic (pË0.05). Sedentary behavior increased significantly (14.9 vs. 29.8%) and between the active ones, the frequency of PEx per week and duration of the PEx practice decreased significantly. The motivation to exercise also changed considering performance and health before and during the pandemic, respectively (10 vs. 5.6% and 72.4 vs. 79.1%). Also, the sample started to exercise less in the night and more in the afternoon, respectively (33.7 vs. 25.3% and 19.1 vs. 31.5%). CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic highly influenced the physical exercise practice and habits (frequency, duration, motivation, period to exercise) in Brazil and its main macro-regions. These results can be used to create measures, as home-based exercise programs, to avoid the harm of sedentary behaviors and mental health impact during and after the pandemic.","Sonza, Anelise; Da Cunha de Sá-Caputo, Danubia; Bachur, José Alexandre; Rodrigues de Araújo, Maria das Graças; Valadares Trippo, Karen Valadares Trippo; Ribeiro Nogueira da Gama, Dirceu Ribeiro Nogueira da Gama; Lago Borges, Daniel; Amaral Mendonça, Vanessa; Bernardo-Filho, Mario",Acta Biomed,,344

247871,Performance analysis of facial recognition: A critical review through glass factor,2021-04-04,"The aim of this study was to test how youth and young adult e-cigarette users responded to the COVID-19 pandemic. The 2020 Youth and Young Adult Vaping Survey (N = 1,308) included 540 (44.7%) participants that reported differences in their vaping behaviors since the onset of the pandemic. Gender was the only relevant covariate that yielded a significant effect and/or interaction through a multivariate test. A two-way multivariate analysis of variance was used to test the effect of pandemic onset (pre- vs. during-pandemic), gender (males vs. females), and their interaction on vaping behaviors (days of vaping per week, episodes of vaping per day, and puffs per vaping episode). Respondents reported fewer days of vaping per week, episodes of vaping per day, and puffs per vaping episode during-pandemic than pre-pandemic [F (3,533) = 52.81, p < 0.001, Î· p 2 = 0.229]. The multivariate effect of gender on the three vaping outcomes was not statistically significant [F (3, 533) = 2.14, p = 0.095, Î· p 2 = 0.012], though the interaction between pandemic onset and gender was [F (3, 533) = 2.86, p = 0.036, Î· p 2 = 0.016]. Males reported fewer episodes of vaping per day [t (262) = 7.40, p < 0.001, 95% CI: 5.19-8.97] and puffs per vaping episode [t (263) = 3.23, p = 0.001, 95% CI:0.292-1.20] during-pandemic than pre-pandemic. Females reported fewer vaping episodes per day during-pandemic than pre-pandemic [t (273) = 5.14, p < 0.001, 95% CI: 2.76-6.18]. Further, females reported more frequent puffs per vaping episode in comparison to males during-pandemic [t (538) = -2.38, p = 0.017, 95% CI: -2.09-0.200]. The COVID-19 pandemic presents an opportunity to reduce vaping through health promotion messaging. Since females take more puffs per vaping episode overall, they may benefit the most from greater vaping cessation supports.","Hopkins, D Brett; Al-Hamdani, Mohammed",Front Public Health,,344
247980,Modeling the commodity prices of base metals in Indian commodity market using a Higher Order Markovian Approach,2020-10-07,"OBJECTIVES: Globally, drug-resistant tuberculosis (DR-TB) is the leading cause of death globally related to antimicrobial resistance, affecting 500,000 emergent cases annually. In 2018, the first United Nations High-Level Meeting (UNHLM) on tuberculosis declared DR-TB a global public health priority. Bold country targets were established for 2018-2022. This study reviews the DR-TB situation in 2018, and the UNHLM target accomplishments in 10 high-burden countries (HBCs). METHODS: An ecological descriptive analysis of the top 10 DR-TB HBCs (Bangladesh, China, India, Indonesia, Myanmar, Nigeria, Pakistan, Philippines, Russian Federation, and South Africa), which share 70% of the global DR-TB burden, was undertaken, complemented by a cascade-of-care analysis and a survey gathering additional information on key advances and setbacks 2 years after the UNHLM declaration. RESULTS: Most countries are showing historic advances and are on track for the 2018 and 2019 targets. However, according to the cascade-of-care, none of the countries are capable of providing effective care for 50% of the estimated patients. Increasing levels of fluoroquinolone resistance and access to timely susceptibility testing can jeopardize ongoing adoption of shorter, all-oral treatment regimens. The programmatic management of DR-TB in children remains minimal. Achievements for 2020 and beyond may be affected significantly by the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. CONCLUSION: Triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic, there is a global risk of recoil in DR-TB care with long-term consequences in terms of deaths, suffering and wider transmission. Investment to support DR-TB services is more important now than ever to meet the aspirations of the UNHLM declaration.","Monedero-Recuero, Ignacio; Gegia, Medea; Wares, Douglas Fraser; Chadha, Sarabjit S; Mirzayev, Fuad",Int J Infect Dis,,344

However, the effects of this pandemic on one's mental health have not been studied at length and are still not known. As all efforts are focused on understanding the epidemiology, clinical features, transmission patterns, and management of the COVID-19 outbreak, there has been very little concern expressed over the effects on one's mental health and on strategies to prevent stigmatization.

To get shielded through this war, the world is racing to reach and manufacture COVID-19 vaccines. Vaccination hesitancy is one of the significant obstacles to global health. OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to assess the perception and attitude of healthcare workers in Egypt toward COVID-19 vaccines, acknowledge the determinants of their attitude, and the factors that could increase the acceptance of the vaccine. METHODS: an observational web-based anonymous survey was conducted on 385 Egyptian healthcare workers in different governorates. The questionnaire-based on Vaccine Hesitancy Survey Questions of the World Health Organization was available in Arabic and English languages and was tested for reliability. RESULTS: Regarding vaccination decision, 51% of the participants were undecided, 28% refused, and 21% accepted vaccination. Reasons for vaccine acceptance mainly were risks of COVID-19 (93%), safety (57.5%), and effectiveness (56.25%) of the vaccine. Simultaneously, the reasons for vaccine hesitancy were the absence of enough clinical trials (92.4%) and fear of side effects of the vaccine (91.4%). The leading factor that could increase vaccination acceptance among the participants was to get sufficient and accurate information about the available vaccines. The participants revealed a high mean level of concern for COVID-19 vaccines' safety (3.8 of 5) that differs significantly among the different study groups (P-value .002). CONCLUSION: Despite the COVID-19 pandemic, only approximately 21% of Egyptian healthcare workers in our study accepted the COVID-19 vaccination. Vaccine hesitancy represents a major barrier to implementing vaccination programs.","Fares, Samar; Elmnyer, Merihan M; Mohamed, Shimaa Sabry; Elsayed, Radwa",J Prim Care Community Health,,344

The IEEE 11073.x standards provide semantic interoperability;the Rosetta Mapping provides vendor-specific semantic interoperability;the IHE DEC/ACM/PIV /SDPi standards provide device-device and device-system communication of clinical care, alerts, and device control messaging, and FHIR provides the formal, granular, Restful JSON or XML message framework for reliable, flexible communication. Since 2005, IHE has been developing the open-source device toolset for home and hospital use. More recently, the IHE SDPi standards have enabled device control capabilities, a capability accelerated during the COVID-19 Coronavirus pandemic to allow nurses/physicians to operate ventilators and infusion devices outside the contaminated patient room. The SDPi innovations are 'just in time, ' perhaps, because to support emerging 'Hospital in Home' or 'ICU in Home' programs, also accelerated by the desire to keep patients safely outside hospital full of COVID patients. Because global adoption of FHIR has been so strong, almost all IHE standards have been revised to support FHIR messaging, too. MDIRA represents a flexible architecture to support device-device or device-EHR communication using either Peer-to-Peer communication (IHE and IoT model), or Peer-to-Aggregator communication (e.g., Open-ICE or Continua). The result of the MDIRA project is the emergence of a standards-based medical communication architecture based on well proven, well documented, and well tested open-source standards © 2021 IEEE.","Sloane, E.

METHODS: The authors conducted a propensity score (PS)-matched double-cohort study (N=5,562 in each cohort) with data from the TriNetX Research Network database to identify 54,529 adult patients (&#8805;18 years) diagnosed as having COVID-19 between February 20 and June 30, 2020. RESULTS: Primary analysis (PS matched on demographic characteristics and presence of diabetes and obesity) showed that substance use disorder was associated with an increased risk of hospitalization (odds ratio [OR]=1.84, 95% confidence interval [CI]=1.69-2.01), ventilator use (OR=1.45, 95% CI=1.22-1.72), and mortality (OR=1.30, 95% CI=1.08-1.56). CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest that COVID-19 patients with substance use disorders are at increased risk for adverse outcomes. The attenuation of ORs in the model that matched for chronic respiratory and cardiovascular diseases associated with substance abuse suggests that the observed risks may be partially mediated by these conditions.","Baillargeon, Jacques; Polychronopoulou, Efstathaia; Kuo, Yong-Fang; Raji, Mukaila A",Psychiatr Serv,,344

These works are currently at different clinical trial stages, and their results may be determined by the outcome of the ongoing trial process. There is the need for a collection of information regarding the availlable therapeutic options related to COVID-19. this article therefore reviewed emerging and re-emerging therapeutic compounds/drugs used in COVID-19 management and reports of clinical trials, with the view to summarize and highlight their prospect and possible adverse effects to allow more extensive choice by clinicians, researchers, and policymakers. The approach used involved retrieval of related collections found in selected repositories including, Medline, Scopus, PubMed, and Google scholar. Only experimental or clinical studies were included. Out of the 39 materials retrieved, 26 (66.67%) studies were based on clinical trials, 12 (30.77%) were classified as in vitro studies, and only one (2.56%) involved experimental animal study. Of the agents evaluated for COVID-19 therapeutics, 15 (38.46%) were anti-viral, four (10.26%) antimalarial, four studies were immunotherapeutics (10.26%), two studies (5.13%) were antibacterial, while, one (2.56%) study wasfor antiparasitic , anticoagulant, anti-inflammatory, anti-viral/antimalarial, and anti-viral/herbal combination for each. Also, eight studies (20.51%) were antibiotic/antimalarial.. This review indicates that there is both a race and quest in the test of antiviral agents against COVID-19 and that arbidol seems to have dominated in the studies analyzed. The use of anticoagulants and antibiotics, such as teicoplanin and azithromycin/hydroxychloroquine were reported to also play a leading role in the management of the disease. Likewise, dexamethasone has been recently claimed to be effective in patients in need of respiratory assistance. Based on unresolved controversies and inconclusive findings, it could be said that generally, a single and specific therapeutics to COVID-19 is still a mirage. There is, thus, an urgent need to test more potent compounds and agents to establish much safer and highly efficacious drugs/agents for the disease, even as we continue to learn more about the disease as well as the characteristic of the virus.","Ismaila, Muhammad Sani; Bande, Faruku; Ishaka, Aminu; Sani, Aminatu Abubakar; Georges, Karla",J Chemother,,344

However, there is little evidence of the applicability of shared and single room occupancy for patients with COVID-19 to determine whether shared room occupancy is feasible. COVID-19-infected patients admitted to the Daegu Dongsan Hospital of Keimyung University from 21 February 2020 to 20 April 2020 were enrolled in the study and randomly assigned to hospital rooms. Clinical symptoms, underlying diseases and epidemiological data of patients were analysed after dividing participants into a shared room occupancy group (group A) and a single room occupancy group (group B). Outcomes analysed included microbiological cure rates, time to clinical symptom improvement, time to defervescence and negative-to-positive conversion rates of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) results during hospitalization. A total of 666 patients were included in this study, 535 and 131 patients in groups A and B, respectively. Group B included more underlying conditions, such as pregnancy and solid organ transplantation, and was more closely associated with severe pneumonia during hospitalization. Besides, no statistically significant differences between the two groups in terms of negative PCR rates at HD 7 and 14, conversion rates of PCR results from negative-to-positive, as well as time to the improvement of clinical symptoms, and time to defervescence were observed. Our results suggest that the shared room occupancy of patients with mild symptoms could be an alternative to single room occupancy during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Hyun, Miri; Lee, Ji Yeon; Kwon, Yong Shik; Kim, Jin Young; Park, Jae Seok; Park, Sunggyun; Ryoo, Namhee; Kim, Hyun Ah",Transbound. emerg. dis.

The lambda spike protein contains novel mutations within the receptor binding domain (L452Q and F490S) that may contribute to its increased transmissibility and could result in susceptibility to re-infection or a reduction in protection provided by current vaccines. In this study, the infectivity and susceptibility of viruses with the lambda variant spike protein to neutralization by convalescent sera and vaccine-elicited antibodies was tested. Virus with the lambda spike had higher infectivity and was neutralized by convalescent sera and vaccine-elicited antibodies with a relatively minor 2.3-3.3-fold decrease in titer on average. The virus was neutralized by the Regeneron therapeutic monoclonal antibody cocktail with no loss of titer. The results suggest that vaccines in current use will remain protective against the lambda variant and that monoclonal antibody therapy will remain effective.","Tada, Takuya; Zhou, Hao; Dcosta, Belinda M; Samanovic, Marie I; Mulligan, Mark J; Landau, Nathaniel R",,,344

In this case report, we describe a case of a 67-year-old male with severe COVID-19 pneumonia who was found on presentation to have left axillary artery thrombosis requiring embolectomy;the case was mana ge successfully. We reviewed the pathophysiology of hypercoagulability associated with COVID-19, clinical implications, and most recent treatment recommendations.","Aljamaan, F. S.",Cureus,,344
258388,COVID-19 heightens water problems around the world,2020,"Following a short discussion concerning the contradictions of the COVID-19 working time ordinance (COVID-19-ArbZV) with the existing ergonomics evidence on the design of working time and its effects on safety, health and wellbeing possible effects of this regulation with regard to the risks of accidents, health and social impairments have been estimated using computer based risk assessments for selected working time systems constructed in accordance with the ordinance.The results show significantly increased risk estimates for all analyzed systems and for all domains, demonstrating a sincere loss in the effectiveness and efficiency of health and safety prevention. Applying these results to the medical sector leads to the conclusion of an elsewhere empirically demonstrated reduction in patient care and patient safety.It is argued that increasing working and reducing rest times of the available work force is not an effective solution for problems of lacking human resources due to its adverse side effects on employees and third parties. Health and safety protection via working time regulations based on ergonomics evidence obviously is not a prominent approach in the FRG.Practical Relevance: A reorientation towards health and safety approaches taking ergonomics evidence into due account is required in the FRG.","Nachreiner, Friedhelm",Z Arbeitswiss,,344

259964,Putin’s world: Russia against the west and the rest,2020,"We present a case-study of the swift digital response to COVID-19 restrictions by the courts in the State of Victoria, Australia’s second-largest jurisdiction. We analyse the extent to which the management of this crisis (Step 1 in John Kotter’s model of innovation) can serve as the catalyst for digital innovation in these courts. We contend that the history of innovation in Australia is of quick, pragmatic fixes which do not translate into systematic change. For example, although Australian courts are often credited with being pioneers in court technology, recourse to apparent ‘virtual courts’ before and during COVID is probably not truly innovative. Applying Boschma’s theory about the 5 ‘proximities’ which promote innovation — geographical, social, cognitive, institutional and organisational — we maintain that for these courts, those factors have, paradoxically, worked in the opposite direction to undermine technological innovation. However COVID has seen critical changes in a number of these elements, supported by ideological and practical concerns for courts. Taken together, we are cautiously optimistic that post-COVID, Kotter’s final stage of “Making it Stick” through a technologically friendly legal culture which supports systematic and sustained court innovation, might just be possible if government is willing to fund a grander innovation agenda and has confidence in the courts’ ability to carry it through. © 2021 The Author(s).

Our study reports on clinician perceptions regarding the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on patients with OCD receiving exposure and response prevention treatment (ERP) prior to and during the pandemic. Participating clinicians completed a survey which included questions adapted from National Institute of Mental Health-Global Obsessive-Compulsive Scale (NIMH-GOCS) and Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS). Clinicians rated clinical features at treatment initiation, just prior to the pandemic, and mid-pandemic (July/August, 2020). Findings suggest that the COVID-19 pandemic was associated with attenuation of ERP progress from expected rates in most patients during first several months of the pandemic; clinicians estimated that 38% of their patients had symptoms worsen during the pandemic and 47% estimated that symptoms remained unchanged despite participating in ERP. Those who endured financial distress or were medically at-risk for severe COVID-19 disease had worse ERP course. Adults also had a worse ERP course during than pandemic than youth. Further research is needed to better understand the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on OCD symptomatology and treatment trajectory post-pandemic.","Storch, Eric A; Sheu, Jessica C; Guzick, Andrew G; Schneider, Sophie C; Cepeda, Sandra L; Rombado, Bianca R; Gupta, Rohit; Hoch, Connor T; Goodman, Wayne K",Psychiatry Res,,344

Patients with mental illnesses may not be able to consistently follow up behavioral prescriptions to avoid contagion, and they are frequently found in settings with close contact and inadequate infection control, such as group homes, homeless shelters, residential rehabilitation centers, and correctional facilities. Furthermore, inpatient psychiatry settings are generally designed as communal spaces, with heavy emphasis on group and milieu therapies. As such, inpatient psychiatry services are vulnerable to rampant spread of contagion. OBJECTIVE: With this in mind, the authors outline the decision process and ultimate design and implementation of a regional inpatient psychiatry unit for patients infected with asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 and share key points for consideration in implementing future units elsewhere. CONCLUSION: A major takeaway point of the analysis is the particular expertise of trained experts in psychosomatic medicine for treating patients infected with SARS-CoV-2.","Angelino, Andrew F; Lyketsos, Constantine G; Ahmed, M Shafeeq; Potash, James B; Cullen, Bernadette A",Psychosomatics,,344
263813,Dynamics of a fractional order mathematical model for COVID-19 epidemic,2020,"Saponins constitute an important class of secondary metabolites of the plant kingdom. Here, we present a mass spectrometry-based database for rapid and easy identification of saponins henceforth referred to as saponin mass spectrometry database (SMSD). With a total of 4196 saponins, 214 of which were obtained from commercial sources. Through liquid chromatography-tandem high-resolution/mass spectrometry (HR/MS) analysis under negative ion mode, the fragmentation behavior for all parent fragment ions almost conformed to successive losses of sugar moieties, &#945;-dissociation and McLafferty rearrangement of aglycones in high-energy collision induced dissociation. The saccharide moieties produced sugar fragment ions from m/z (monosaccharide) to m/z (polysaccharides). The parent and sugar fragment ions of other saponins were predicted using the above mentioned fragmentation pattern. The SMSD is freely accessible at http://47.92.73.208:8082/ or http://cpu-smsd.com (preferrably using google). It provides three search modes (""CLASSIFY"", ""SEARCH"" and ""METABOLITE""). Under the ""CLASSIFY"" function, saponins are classified with high predictive accuracies from all metabolites by establishment of logistic regression model through their mass data from HR/MS input as a csv file, where the first column is ID and the second column is mass. For the ""SEARCH"" function, saponins are searched against parent ions with certain mass tolerance in ""MS Ion Search"". Then, daughter ions with certain mass tolerance are input into ""MS/MS Ion Search"". The optimal candidates were screened out according to the match count and match rate values in comparison with fragment data in database. Additionally, another logistic regression model completely differentiated between parent and sugar fragment ions. This function designed in front web is conducive to search and recheck. With the ""METABOLITE"" function, saponins are searched using their common names, where both full and partial name searches are supported. With these modes, saponins of diverse chemical composition can be explored, grouped and identified with a high degree of predictive accuracy. This specialized database would aid in the identification of saponins in complex matrices particular in the study of traditional Chinese medicines or plant metabolomics.","Huang, Feng-Qing; Dong, Xuesi; Yin, Xiaojian; Fan, Yang; Fan, Yuanming; Mao, Chencheng; Zhou, Wei",J Chromatogr A,,344

This was a prospective, observational, physiological, cohort study on consecutive adult patients with COVID-19 pneumonia admitted in April-May 2020 in the high dependency respiratory unit of L. Sacco University Hospital in Milan (Italy). During hospitalization, patients underwent chest computed tomography (CT), blood gas analysis, spirometry, and lung diffusion capacity for carbon monoxide (DLco), which were repeated 6 weeks post-discharge. Chest CTs were individually read by two expert radiologists, that calculated the total severity score (TSS). Twenty patients completed the study (mean age 58.2 years, 70% males). During the acute phase, mean DLco, alveolar volume (VA), and vital capacity (VC) were 56.0 (16.3), 64.8 (14.0), and 71.7 (16.9) % predicted, respectively, and were inversely associated with PaO2/FiO2 ratio. Fifty percent of patients had a restrictive ventilatory pattern; mean TSS was 7.9 (4.0). At follow up, gas exchange parameters were normalized; consolidations persisted in 10% of cases, while DLco was <80% predicted in 65% of patients and was independently predicted by Log10D-dimer at admission (ß -18.675; 95%CI, -28.373--9.076; p = 0.001). In conclusion, functional abnormalities in COVID-19 pneumonia survivors can persist during follow up and are associated with the severity of the disease.","Santus, Pierachille; Flor, Nicola; Saad, Marina; Pini, Stefano; Franceschi, Elisa; Airoldi, Andrea; Gaboardi, Paolo; Ippolito, Sonia; Rizzi, Maurizio; Radovanovic, Dejan",,,344

A model for smart transportation is proposed by considering four indicators, including transport efficiency, technology integration, traffic congestion rate, and accessibility ratio. While prior health crises, such as SARS, impacted the transportation sector, the COVID-19 pandemic is unprecedented, resulting in exceptional impacts on this sector. Canadian Civil Aviation activities dropped by 71%, compared to business as usual, whereas military aviation activities declined by 27%. As of the end of June 2020, cities with higher than 50% mobility index include Brussels, Singapore, Stockholm, Lyon, Paris, Moscow, and Hong Kong with the highest mobility index of 76%. American cities have the lowest mobility indexes as of the end of June with mobility indexes lower than 20%. It is expected and reasonable to assume that the public's response to COVID-19 will exceed that of SARS. While Britons and Canadians are the biggest supporters of keeping the economy and businesses shut until COVID-19 is fully contained, the Chinese, Russians, Indians, and Italians find it vital to restart the economy regardless. Results show that the majority of the world is in a state of mental distress and will face nervousness and anxiety issues post-COVID-19. This sentiment is strongest in India, Japan, China, the U.K., Brazil and Canada, ranging between 68% and 78%. The trucking industry is the main contributor to the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of the Canadian transportation sector, accounting for more than 62% of the total emissions in 2019. Given the impact of COVID-19, forecasted GHG emissions of the Canadian transportation sector for 2020is evaluated to be 93 megatonnes of carbon dioxide equivalents.","Abu-Rayash, Azzam; Dincer, Ibrahim",Energy Res.

Trials for both antivirals and vaccines are in progress; candidates include existing repurposed drugs that were originally developed for other ailments. Once these are shown to be effective, their production will need to be ramped up rapidly to keep pace with the growing demand as the pandemic progresses. It is highly likely that the drugs will be in short supply in the interim, which leaves policymakers and medical personnel with the difficult task of determining how to allocate them. Under such conditions, mathematical models can provide valuable decision support. In particular, useful models can be derived from process integration techniques that deal with tight resource constraints. In this paper, a linear programming model is developed to determine the optimal allocation of COVID-19 drugs that minimizes patient fatalities, taking into account additional hospital capacity constraints. Two hypothetical case studies are solved to illustrate the computational capability of the model, which can generate an allocation plan with outcomes that are superior to simple ad hoc allocation.","Sy, C L; Aviso, K B; Cayamanda, C D; Chiu, A S F; Lucas, R I G; Promentilla, M A B; Razon, L F; Tan, R R; Tapia, J F D; Torneo, A R; Ubando, A T; Yu, D E C",Clean Technol Environ Policy,,344

To fill this gap of knowledge, we tested psychometric properties of the REPOS when used for pain assessment in this population. METHODS: In this multicentre observational study, residents were filmed during a possibly painful moment and at rest. Healthcare professionals were asked to rate residents' pain by means of a Numeric Rating Scale (NRS)-proxy. Two researchers assessed pain with the REPOS and the Chronic Pain Scale for Non Verbal Adults with Intellectual Disabilities (CPS-NAID) from video-recordings. RESULTS: In total, 168 observations from 84 residents were assessed. Inter-observer reliability between the two researchers was good, with Cohen's kappa 0.72 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.64 to 0.79]. Correlation between the REPOS and CPS-NAID for a possibly painful moment was 0.73 (95% CI 0.65 to 0.79). Sensitivity (85%) and specificity (61%) for the detection of pain were calculated with REPOS &#8805; 3 and NRS &#8805; 4 as a reference value. Item response theory analysis shows that the item grimace displayed perfect discrimination between residents with and without pain.

To investigate whether naturally occurring RBD mutations during the early transmission phase have altered the receptor binding affinity and infectivity, we first analyzed in silico the binding dynamics between SARS-CoV-2 RBD mutants and the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor. Among 32,123 genomes of SARS-CoV-2 isolates (December 2019 through March 2020), 302 nonsynonymous RBD mutants were identified and clustered into 96 mutant types. The six dominant mutations were analyzed applying molecular dynamics simulations (MDS). The mutant type V367F continuously circulating worldwide displayed higher binding affinity to human ACE2 due to the enhanced structural stabilization of the RBD beta-sheet scaffold. The MDS also indicated that it would be difficult for bat SARS-like CoV to infect humans. However, the pangolin CoV is potentially infectious to humans. The increased infectivity of V367 mutants was further validated by performing receptor-ligand binding enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), surface plasmon resonance, and pseudotyped virus assays. Phylogenetic analysis of the genomes of V367F mutants showed that during the early transmission phase, most V367F mutants clustered more closely with the SARS-CoV-2 prototype strain than the dual-mutation variants (V367F+D614G), which may derivate from recombination. The analysis of critical RBD mutations provides further insights into the evolutionary trajectory of early SARS-CoV-2 variants of zoonotic origin under negative selection pressure and supports the continuing surveillance of spike mutations to aid in the development of new COVID-19 drugs and vaccines. IMPORTANCE A novel coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has caused the pandemic of COVID-19. The origin of SARS-CoV-2 was associated with zoonotic infections. The spike protein receptor-binding domain (RBD) is identified as the critical determinant of viral tropism and infectivity. Thus, whether mutations in the RBD of the circulating SARS-CoV-2 isolates have altered the receptor binding affinity and made them more infectious has been the research hot spot. Given that SARS-CoV-2 is a novel coronavirus, the significance of our research is in identifying and validating the RBD mutant types emerging during the early transmission phase and increasing human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor binding affinity and infectivity. Our study provides insights into the evolutionary trajectory of early SARS-CoV-2 variants of zoonotic origin. The continuing surveillance of RBD mutations with increased human ACE2 affinity in human or other animals is critical to the development of new COVID-19 drugs and vaccines against these variants during the sustained COVID-19 pandemic.","Ou, Junxian; Zhou, Zhonghua; Dai, Ruixue; Zhang, Jing; Zhao, Shan; Wu, Xiaowei; Lan, Wendong; Ren, Yi; Cui, Lilian; Lan, Qiaoshuai; Lu, Lu; Seto, Donald; Chodosh, James; Wu, Jianguo; Zhang, Gong; Zhang, Qiwei",J Virol,,344
269759,Working on local time: Testing the job-demand-control-support model of stress with jail officers,2020,"BACKGROUND: Use of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) has been hypothesized to affect COVID-19 risk. OBJECTIVE: To examine the association between use of ACEI/ARB and household transmission of COVID-19. METHODS: We conducted a modified cohort study of household contacts of patients who tested positive for COVID-19 between March 4 and May 17, 2020 in a large Northeast US health system. Household members were identified by geocoding and full address matching with exclusion of addresses with >10 matched residents or known congregate living functions. Medication use, clinical conditions and sociodemographic characteristics were obtained from electronic medical record (EMR) data on cohort entry. Cohort members were followed for at least one month after exposure to determine who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Mixed effects logistic regression and propensity score analyses were used to assess adjusted associations between medication use and testing positive. RESULTS: 1,499 of the 9,101 household contacts were taking an ACEI or an ARB. Probability of COVID-19 diagnosis during the study period was slightly higher among ACEI/ARB users in unadjusted analyses. However, ACEI/ARB users were older and more likely to have clinical comorbidities so that use of ACEI/ARB was associated with a decreased risk of being diagnosed with COVID-19 in mixed effect models (OR 0.60, 95% CI 0.44-0.81) or propensity score analyses (predicted probability 18.6% in ACEI/ARB users vs. 24.5% in non-users, p = 0.03). These associations were similar within age and comorbidity subgroups, including patients with documented hypertension, diabetes or cardiovascular disease, as well as when including other medications in the models. CONCLUSIONS: In this observational study of household transmission, use of ACEIs or ARBs was associated with a decreased risk of being diagnosed with COVID-19. While causality cannot be inferred from these observational data, our results support current recommendations to continue ACEI/ARB in individuals at risk of COVID-19 exposure.","Armstrong, Katrina; Soltoff, Alex; Rieu-Werden, Meghan; Metlay, Joshua; Haas, Jennifer",PLoS One,,344
269959,Analysis and tuning of hierarchical topic models based on Renyi entropy approach,2021-01-19,"The profound consequences of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) mandate urgent development of effective vaccines. Here, we evaluated an Amphiphile (AMP) vaccine adjuvant, AMP-CpG, composed of diacyl lipid-modified CpG, admixed with the SARS-CoV-2 Spike-2 receptor binding domain protein as a candidate vaccine (ELI-005) in mice. AMP modification efficiently delivers CpG to lymph nodes, where innate and adaptive immune responses are generated. Compared to alum, immunization with AMP-CpG induced >25-fold higher antigen-specific T cells that produced multiple T helper 1 (TH1) cytokines and trafficked into lung parenchyma. Antibody responses favored TH1 isotypes (IgG2c and IgG3) and potently neutralized Spike-2-ACE2 receptor binding, with titers 265-fold higher than natural convalescent patient COVID-19 responses; T cell and antibody responses were maintained despite 10-fold dose reduction in Spike antigen. Both cellular and humoral immune responses were preserved in aged mice. These advantages merit clinical translation to SARS-CoV-2 and other protein subunit vaccines.","Steinbuck, Martin P; Seenappa, Lochana M; Jakubowski, Aniela; McNeil, Lisa K; Haqq, Christopher M; DeMuth, Peter C",Sci.

METHODS: From 14 February to 29 March 2020, an online survey was performed in both 605 health care workers and 1151 non-health care workers. Based on the somatization dimension score of the Symptom Checklist-90, participants were divided into non-SOM group and SOM group. RESULTS: Health care workers had higher prevalence rate of SOM (p < 0.001) than non-health care workers, with an OR of 1.70 (95% CI, 1.22-2.36, p = 0.002). Multiple logistic regression analysis revealed that in non-health care workers, the risk factors of SOM included other ethnicities, insomnia, and suicide, while in health care workers, the risk factors included working 6-8 h per day, and working &#8805;10 h per day during COVID-19 outbreak. CONCLUSIONS: Our research suggests that both non-health care workers and health care workers have a relatively high prevalence of somatization. However, the related factors for somatization in both groups are significantly different, showing that medical service-related factors are associated with somatization in health care workers, while demographic and clinical factors are associated with somatization in non-health care workers.","Song, Xiuli; Zhou, Yongjie; Rao, Wenwang; Zhang, Xiangyang",BMC Psychiatry,,344

271011,Developing and Validating a Novel Anonymous Method for Matching Longitudinal School-Based Data,2020,"BACKGROUND: Novel Corona virus is a type of enveloped viruses with a single stranded RNA enclosing helical nucleocapsid. The envelope consists of spikes on the surface which are made up of proteins through which virus enters into human cells. Until now there is no specific drug or vaccine available to treat COVID-19 infection. In this scenario, reposting of drug or active molecules may provide rapid solution to fight against this deadly disease. OBJECTIVE: We had selected 30 phytoconstituents from the different plants which are reported for antiviral activities against corona virus (CoVs) and performed insilico screening to find out phytoconstituents which have potency to inhibit specific target of novel corona virus. METHODS: We had perform molecular docking studies on three different proteins of novel corona virus namely COVID-19 main protease (3CL pro), papain-like protease (PL pro) and spike protein (S) attached to ACE2 binding domain. The screening of the phytoconstituents on the basis of binding affinity compared to standard drugs. The validations of screened compounds were done using ADMET and bioactivity prediction. RESULTS: We had screened five compounds biscoclaurine, norreticuline, amentoflavone, licoricidin and myricetin using insilico approach. All compounds found safe in insilico toxicity studies. Bioactivity prediction reviles that these all compounds may act through protease or enzyme inhibition. Results of compound biscoclaurine norreticuline were more interesting as this biscoclaurine had higher binding affinity for the target 3CLpro and PLpro targets and norreticuline had higher binding affinity for the target PLpro and Spike protein. CONCLUSION: Our study concludes that these compounds could be further explored rapidly as it may have potential to fight against COVID-19.","Shah, Ashish; Patel, Vaishali; Parmar, Bhumika",,,344

272370,Infodemics: A call to action for interdisciplinary research,2020-07-23,"Increasing production and use of various novel plastics products, a low recycling rate, and lack of effective recy-cling/disposal methods have resulted in an exponential growth in plastic waste accumulation in landfills and in the environment. To better understand the effects of plastic waste, Life Cycle Analysis (LCA) was done to com-pare the effects of various production and disposal methods. LCA shows the specific effects of the cradle-to-grave or cradle-to-cradle scenarios for landfill, incineration, and mechanical recycling. The analysis clearly indicates that increasing recycling of plastics can significantly save energy and eliminate harmful emissions of various carcino-gens and GHGs into the environment. As recycling increases, the need for virgin-plastic production can be greatly reduced. Furthermore, the results of this study may help improve current mechanical recycling processes as well as potential future recycling methods, such as chemical recycling. Concerns about the current recycling/disposal methods for plastics have brought increasing attention to the waste accumulation problem. However, with the current COVID-19 pandemic, plastic accumulation is expected to increase significantly in the near future. A better understanding of the quantitative effects of the various disposal methods can help guide policies and future research toward effective solutions of the plastic waste problem. © 2021, Tech Science Press.

273712,Stability analysis of epidemiological models incorporating heterogeneous infectivity,2020,"The aim of this study was to examine the association among representations of the COVID-19 pandemic, self-efficacy to cope with the anti-pandemic measures (e.g., general lockdown), and psychological distress in the Greek general population. The study was conducted online, during the general lockdown in the country, and 358 individuals (239 females) participated (mean age = 36.89; SD = 12.15). A perception of personal control over the condition, negative emotions towards the pandemic, and self-efficacy to cope with the current anti-pandemic measures were related to psychological distress. Also, a significant interaction between representation clusters and self-efficacy to cope with potential future difficulties (i.e., after the anti-pandemic measures are ended), was found. Specifically, the association between this type of self-efficacy and psychological distress was significant only for the 'low-impact' representations cluster (i.e., a perception of the pandemic as less burdensome and more controllable). The findings indicate that the factors which, according to previous research and theory, are significantly related to psychological distress during a health threat, are important also in times of a pandemic. They also suggest a potential adaptation-promoting synergy between pandemic-related self-efficacy and a more positive representation of COVID-19, as far as psychological distress is conerned. Thus, these factors may serve as the basis for the development of pandemic-related health behavior promotion programs.","Karademas, Evangelos C; Thomadakis, Christophoros",Curr Psychol,,344

273993,Data Mining in Clinical Trial Text: Transformers for Classification and Question Answering Tasks,2020-01-30,"When the training and test data are from different distributions, domain adaptation is needed to reduce dataset bias to improve the model's generalization ability. Since it is difficult to directly match the cross-domain joint distributions, existing methods tend to reduce the marginal or conditional distribution divergence using predefined distances such as MMD and adversarial-based discrepancies. However, it remains challenging to determine which method is suitable for a given application since they are built with certain priors or bias. Thus they may fail to uncover the underlying relationship between transferable features and joint distributions. This paper proposes Learning to Match (L2M) to automatically learn the cross-domain distribution matching without relying on hand-crafted priors on the matching loss. Instead, L2M reduces the inductive bias by using a meta-network to learn the distribution matching loss in a data-driven way. L2M is a general framework that unifies task-independent and human-designed matching features. We design a novel optimization algorithm for this challenging objective with self-supervised label propagation. Experiments on public datasets substantiate the superiority of L2M over SOTA methods. Moreover, we apply L2M to transfer from pneumonia to COVID-19 chest X-ray images with remarkable performance. L2M can also be extended in other distribution matching applications where we show in a trial experiment that L2M generates more realistic and sharper MNIST samples.","Yu, Chaohui; Wang, Jindong; Liu, Chang; Qin, Tao; Xu, Renjun; Feng, Wenjie; Chen, Yiqiang; Liu, Tie-Yan",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.10791v3.pdf,344

However, the tone and content of communication varies across and within countries and led to conflicting results in terms of collective sensemaking. To understand how government leaders' messages shape emotional and cognitive responses of citizens, we designed a 2x2 vignette experiment in which we manipulate the framing (pessimistic vs. optimistic) and content of the message (specific vs. general) delivered by a political leader. Results from 436 participants showed that while the tone of leader's messages has significant implications for the levels of anxiety and evaluation of the government's truthfulness and its overall response to the crisis, the content of the leader's message matters less. Furthermore, these effects were particularly experienced by women and left-leaning participants. Overall, our results highlight the importance of the leader's communication strategies on influencing the public's emotional reactions, as well as the perceptions of government effectiveness in dealing with the crisis.","Sobral, Filipe; Carvalho, Juliana; amp,; 321,; agowska, Urszula; Furtado, Liliane Magalhães Girardin Pimentel; Grobman, Miriam",Rev. adm. pública (Online),,344

278392,What is the supply and demand for coloured wood products? An empirical study in slovakian practice,2021,"BACKGROUND: The world is currently witnessing a major devastating pandemic of Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19). This disease is caused by a novel coronavirus named Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). It primarily affects the respiratory tract and particularly the lungs. The virus enters the cell by attaching its spike-like surface projections to the angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE-2) expressed in various tissues. Though the majority of symptomatic patients have mild flu-like symptoms, a significant minority develop severe lung injury with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), leading to considerable morbidity and mortality. Elderly patients with previous cardiovascular comorbidities are particularly susceptible to severe clinical manifestations. BODY: Currently, our limited knowledge of the pathologic findings is based on post-mortem biopsies, a few limited autopsies, and very few complete autopsies. From these reports, we know that the virus can be found in various organs but the most striking tissue damage involves the lungs resulting almost always in diffuse alveolar damage with interstitial edema, capillary congestion, and occasional interstitial lymphocytosis, causing hypoxia, multiorgan failure, and death. A few pathology studies have also reported intravascular microthrombi and pulmonary thrombembolism. Although the clinical presentation of this disease is fairly well characterized, knowledge of the pathologic aspects remains comparatively limited. CONCLUSION: In this review, we discuss clinical, pathologic, and genomic features of COVID-19, review current hypotheses regarding the pathogenesis, and briefly discuss the clinical characteristics. We also compare the salient features of COVID-19 with other coronavirus-related illnesses that have posed significant public health issues in the past, including SARS and the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS).","Mohanty, Sambit K; Satapathy, Abhishek; Naidu, Machita M; Mukhopadhyay, Sanjay; Sharma, Shivani; Barton, Lisa M; Stroberg, Edana; Duval, Eric J; Pradhan, Dinesh; Tzankov, Alexandar; Parwani, Anil V",Diagn Pathol,,344

278837,"Decolonization is a process, not a goal: Encounters in the library of the Kunsthalle Basel",2020,"PURPOSE: To assess perceptions of occupational risk and changes to clinical practice of ophthalmology trainees in the United States during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. DESIGN: An anonymous, nonvalidated, cross-sectional survey was conducted online. Data were collected from April 7 through 16, 2020. PARTICIPANTS: Second-year U.S. vitreoretinal surgery fellows in two-year training programs were invited to participate. METHODS: Online survey. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Survey questions assessed policies guiding COVID-19 response, exposure to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, changes in clinical duties, and methods to reduce occupational risk, including availability of personal protective equipment (PPE). RESULTS: Completed responses were obtained from 62 of 87 eligible recipients (71.2% response rate). Training settings included academic (58.1%), hybrid academic/private practice (35.5%), and private practice only settings (6.5%). Overall, 19.4% of respondents reported an exposure to a COVID-19-positive patient, 14.5% reported self-quarantining due to possible exposure, and 11.3% reported being tested for COVID-19. In regards to PPE, N95 masks were available in the emergency room (n = 40 [64.5%]), office (n = 35 [56.5%]), and operating room (n = 35 [56.5%]) settings. Perceived comfort level with PPE recommendations was significantly associated with availability of an N95 respirator mask in the clinic (P < 0.001), emergency room (P < 0.001), or operating room (P = 0.002) settings. Additional risk mitigation methods outside of PPE were: reduction in patient volume (n = 62 [100%]), limiting patient companions (n = 59 [95.2%]), use of a screening process (n = 59 [95.2%]), use of a slit-lamp face shield (n = 57 [91.9%]), temperature screening of all persons entering clinical space (n = 34 [54.84%]), and placement of face mask on patients (n = 33 [53.2%]). Overall, 16.1% reported additional clinical duties within the scope of ophthalmology, and 3.2% reported being re-deployed to nonophthalmology services. 98.4% of respondents, 98.4% expected a reduction in surgical case volume. No respondents reported loss of employment or reduction in pay or benefits due to COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: Suspected or confirmed clinical exposure to COVID-19-positive patients occurred in approximately one fifth of trainee respondents. Perceived comfort level with PPE standards was significantly associated with N95 respirator mask availability. As surgical training programs grapple with the COVID-19 pandemic, analysis of trainees' concerns may inform development of mitigation strategies.","Khan, M Ali; Sivalingam, Arunan; Haller, Julia A",Ophthalmol Retina,,344

Theriault et al",2020,"As the pandemic continues to evolve, more cases of COVID-19 in pediatric patients are being detected. A 12-year-old boy with HbSC disease alpha-thalassemia trait presented to a pediatric emergency room with fever and weakness. His vital signs were notable for fever, tachypnea, and tachycardia. His physical exam was concerning for increased work of breathing. He tested positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) by PCR although his hemoglobin level remained near his baseline. His chest radiograph showed a retrocardiac opacity concerning for evolving acute chest syndrome. He decompensated quickly requiring invasive mechanical ventilation and exchange transfusion. He received hydroxychloroquine, broad-spectrum antibiotics, and enoxaparin for DVT prophylaxis. Despite showing clinical signs of improvement, he became acutely hypoxemic and suffered a cardiac arrest. We believe this to be an unusual case of a pediatric patient with HbSC disease and COVID-19. We outline clearly the course of illness and treatments trialed, which can prove beneficial to providers facing similar challenges as this virus continues to strike areas around the world. Although children have significantly better outcomes than adults, providers must remain vigilant while treating any patient with a hemoglobinopathy in the setting of severe COVID-19.

281711,Editor’s Note: When Everyone Became a Teacher,2020,"BACKGROUND: The relationship of health disparities and comorbidities in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) related outcomes are an ongoing area of interest. This report assesses risk factors associated with mortality in patients presenting with Covid-19 infection and healthcare disparities. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study of consecutive patients presenting to emergency departments within an integrated health system who tested positive for COVID-19 between March 7 and April 30, 2020 in Metropolitan Detroit. The primary outcomes were hospitalization and 30-day mortality. RESULTS: A total of 3,633 patients with mean age of 58 years were included. The majority were female and black non-Hispanic. Sixty-four percent required hospitalization, 56% of whom were black. Hospitalized patients were older, more likely to reside in a low-income area, and had a higher burden of comorbidities. By 30-days, 433 (18.7%) hospitalized patients died. In adjusted analyses, the presence of comorbidities, age >60 years and more severe physiological disturbance were associated with 30-day mortality. Residence in low income areas (odds ratio, 1.02; 95% confidence interval 0.76 - 1.36), and public insurance (odds ratio, 1.24; 95% confidence interval 0.76 - 2.01) were not independently associated with higher risk of mortality. Black female patients had a lower adjusted risk of mortality (odds ratio, 0.46; 95% confidence interval, 0.27 to 0.78). CONCLUSIONS: In this large cohort of COVID-19 patients, those with comorbidities, advanced age, and physiological abnormalities on presentation had higher odds of death. Disparities in income or source of health insurance were not associated with outcomes. Black women had a lower risk of dying.","Miller, Joseph; Fadel, Raef A; Tang, Amy; Perrotta, Giuseppe; Herc, Erica; Soman, Sandeep; Nair, Sashi; Hanna, Zachary; Zervos, Marcus J; Alangaden, George; Brar, Indira; Suleyman, Geehan",Clin Infect Dis,,344

282769,Integrated Approach to the Management of the Landscape for the Implementation of the Danube Strategy,2020,"BACKGROUNDS: SARS-CoV-2 is affecting different countries all over the world, with significant variation in infection-rate and death-ratio. We have previously shown a presence of a possible relationship between different variables including the Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccine, average age, gender, and malaria treatment, and the rate of spread, severity and mortality of COVID-19 disease. This paper focuses on developing machine learning models for this relationship. METHODS: We have used real-datasets collected from the Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control to develop a model from China data as the baseline country. From this model, we predicted and forecasted different countries' daily confirmed-cases and daily death-cases and examined if there was any possible effect of the variables mentioned above. RESULTS: The model was trained based on China data as a baseline model for daily confirmed-cases and daily death-cases. This machine learning application succeeded in modelling and forecasting daily confirmed-cases and daily death-cases. The modelling and forecasting of viral spread resulted in four different regions; these regions were dependent on the malarial treatments, BCG vaccination, weather conditions, and average age. However, the lack of social distancing resulted in variation in the effect of these factors, for example, double-humped spread and mortality cases curves and sudden increases in the spread and mortality cases in different countries. The process of machine learning for time-series prediction and forecasting, especially in the pandemic COVID-19 domain, proved usefulness in modelling and forecasting the end status of the virus spreading based on specific regional and health support variables. CONCLUSION: From the experimental results, we confirm that COVID-19 has a very low spread in the African countries with all the four variables (average young age, hot weather, BCG vaccine and malaria treatment); a very high spread in European countries and the USA with no variable (old people, cold weather, no BCG vaccine and no malaria). The effect of the variables could be on the spread or the severity to the extent that the infected subject might not have symptoms or the case is mild and can be missed as a confirmed-case. Social distancing decreases the effect of these factors.","Zawbaa, Hossam M; El-Gendy, Ahmed; Saeed, Haitham; Osama, Hasnaa; Ali, Ahmed M A; Gomaa, Dina; Abdelrahman, Mona; Harb, Hadeer S; Madney, Yasmin M; Abdelrahim, Mohamed E A",Int J Clin Pract,,344
283323,Living in Interesting Times,2020,"OBJECTIVE: Research demonstrates a variety of cognitive benefits induced by different chronic physiological stressors (e.g. motor vs. cardiovascular exercise training) and acute exercise to affect steroid hormone secretion, the present study aims to investigate 1.) motor vs. cardiovascular exercise training and their impact on salivary Testosterone, Estradiol and Progesterone and 2.) whether alterations in steroid hormones might moderate exercise-induced cognitive benefits. METHODS: In a randomized control trial, 71 preadolescent children (39 girls) at the age of 9-10 years were randomly assigned to a cardiovascular exercise group (CE), a motor exercise group (ME) as well as a control group (CON) in which students were attending assisted homework. The participants attended their program three times per week, for a total of 10 weeks. Steroid hormones in the saliva, working memory performance and state-trait anxiety levels were determined before and after the intervention. RESULTS: Statistical analysis showed no chronic changes in hormones through the interventions. Stepwise hierarchical regression revealed the Testosterone*ME-interaction to be a significant moderator for working memory performance post-intervention (ßâ¯=â¯0.48, pâ¯=â¯0.014). Within the ME, increases of Testosterone from t1 to t2 were predicting higher working memory performance post-intervention (ßâ¯=â¯0.45, R2â¯=â¯0.16, pâ¯=â¯0.038). CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest 1.) that motor-exercise-induced cognitive benefits are moderated by changes in Testosterone and 2.) that a 10-week exercise training of moderate intensity and with a motor demanding vs a cardiovascular character does not affect the chronic concentration of salivary Testosterone, Estradiol and Progesterone nor anxiety levels in preadolescent children.","Akko, Davin P; Koutsandréou, Flora; Murillo-Rodríguez, Eric; Wegner, Mirko; Budde, Henning",Physiol Behav,,344

284934,Science Communication in the Age of Misinformation,2020,"The purpose of this study is to find the demographic factors associated with the spread of COVID-19 and to suggest a measure for identifying the effectiveness of government policies in controlling COVID-19. The study hypothesizes that the cumulative number of confirmed COVID-19 patients depends on the urban population, rural population, number of persons older than 50, population density, and poverty rate. A log-linear model is used to test the stated hypothesis, with the cumulative number of confirmed COVID-19 patients up to period t as a dependent variable and demographic factors as an independent variable. The policy effectiveness indicator is calculated by taking the difference of the COVID rank of the ith state based on the predicted model and the actual COVID rank of the ith state. Our study finds that the urban population significantly impacts the spread of COVID-19. On the other hand, demographic factors such as rural population, density, and age structure do not impact the spread of COVID-19 significantly. Thus, people residing in urban areas face a significant threat of COVID-19 as compared to people in rural areas.","Pandey, Ashutosh; Saxena, Nitin Kishore",Int J Health Serv,,344
284938,A “Leaky” Pipeline and Chilly Climate in Archaeology in Canada,2021,"In medical image classification tasks, it is common to find that the number of normal samples far exceeds the number of abnormal samples. In such class-imbalanced situations, reliable training of deep neural networks continues to be a major challenge. Under these circumstances, the predicted class probabilities may be biased toward the majority class. Calibration has been suggested to alleviate some of these effects. However, there is insufficient analysis explaining when and whether calibrating a model would be beneficial in improving performance. In this study, we perform a systematic analysis of the effect of model calibration on its performance on two medical image modalities, namely, chest X-rays and fundus images, using various deep learning classifier backbones. For this, we study the following variations: (i) the degree of imbalances in the dataset used for training; (ii) calibration methods; and (iii) two classification thresholds, namely, default decision threshold of 0.5, and optimal threshold from precision-recall curves. Our results indicate that at the default operating threshold of 0.5, the performance achieved through calibration is significantly superior (p<0.05) to using uncalibrated probabilities. However, at the PR-guided threshold, these gains are not significantly different (p>0.05). This finding holds for both image modalities and at varying degrees of imbalance.","Rajaraman, Sivaramakrishnan; Ganesan, Prasanth; Antani, Sameer",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2110.00918v3.pdf,344

In this study, we measured the perceived stress in response to the COVID-19 pandemic among Iranians to determine the groups at both extremes of the spectrum followed by identifying the stressors and coping mechanisms. METHODS: This study was a mixed-methods study. We distributed a web-based 10-item perceived stress scale (PSS-10), to measure perceived stress score (PSS), through social networks from March 12 to 23, 2020. Then, we interviewed 42 students, 31 homemakers, 27 healthcare providers, and 21 male participants to identify the sources of stress and coping mechanisms. RESULTS: Finally, 13,454 participants completed the questionnaires. The median and interquartile range (IQR) of the participants' PSS was 21 (15-25). Students, homemakers, and healthcare workers (HCWs) showed a higher median (IQR) of PSS compared to other groups (23 [18 to 27], 22 [16 to 26], and 19 [14 to 24], respectively). Male participants showed a lower median (IQR) PSS (17 [12 to 23]). Content analysis of 121 participants' answers showed that the most common stressors were school-related issues mentioned by students, family-related issues mentioned by homemakers, and COVID-19-related issues mentioned by healthcare providers. Male participants' coping mechanisms were mostly related to the perception of their abilities to cope with the current crisis. CONCLUSION: Our participants clinically showed a moderate level of PSS. The main stressors among students, homemakers, and HCWs were related to their principal role in this period, and male participants' coping mechanisms were inspired by the self-image retrieved from the social perspectives.","Faghankhani, Masoomeh; Sodagari, Faezeh; Shokrani, Marjan; Baradaran, Hamid Reza; Adabi, Alimohammad; Zabihi, Masoud; Adeli, Aliyeh Mahdavi; Fathimakvand, Mahdi; Golalipour, Elahe; Aghdasi, Sina; Javanbakht, Arash; Nadoushan, Amir Hossein Jalali",Can J Psychiatry,,344

Many COVID-19 patients present with fever in the early phase, with some progressing to a hyperinflammatory phase. Ethanol (EtOH) exposure may lead to systemic inflammation. Network meta-analysis was conducted to examine possible relationships between EtOH consumption and COVID-19 pathologies. METHODS: Molecules affected by EtOH exposure were identified by analysis with QIAGEN Knowledge Base. Molecules affected by COVID-19 were identified from studies in MEDLINE, bioRxiv, and medRxiv reporting gene expression profiles in COVID-19 patients, QIAGEN Coronavirus Network Explorer, and analysis of the RNA-sequencing data of autopsied lungs of COVID-19 patients retrieved from the GEO database. Network meta-analysis was then conducted on these molecules using QIAGEN Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA). RESULTS: Twenty-eight studies reporting significant gene expression changes in COVID-19 patients were identified. One RNA-sequencing dataset on autopsied lungs of COVID-19 patients was retrieved from GEO. Our network meta-analysis suggests that EtOH exposure may augment the effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection on hepatic fibrosis signaling pathway, cellular metabolism and homeostasis, inflammation, and neuroinflammation. EtOH may also enhance the activity of key mediators including cytokines, such as IL-1ß, IL-6, and TNF, and transcription factors, such as JUN and STAT, while inhibiting the activity of anti-inflammatory mediators including glucocorticoid receptor. Furthermore, IL-1ß, IL-6, TNF, JUN, and STAT were mapped to 10 pathways predicted to associate with SARS-CoV-2 proteins, including HMGB1, IL-1, and IL-6 signaling pathways. CONCLUSIONS: Our meta-analyses demonstrate that EtOH exposure may augment SARS-CoV-2-induced inflammation by altering the activity of key inflammatory mediators. Our findings suggest that it is important for clinicians to caution patients about the risk of alcohol consumption, which has increased during the COVID-19 pandemic. The findings also call for further investigation into how alcohol exposure affects viral infections.","Huang, Wenfei; Zhou, Heping; Hodgkinson, Colin; Montero, Angelo; Goldman, David; Chang, Sulie L",Alcohol. clin. exp. res,,344

Non-replicating viral vector strategies, inactivated virus, recombinant protein subunit vaccines, and nucleic acid vaccine platforms are all being pursued in an effort to combat the infection. Preclinical and clinal trial results of these efforts are examined as well as the characteristics of each vaccine strategy from the humoral and cellular immune responses they stimulate, effects of any adjuvants used, and the potential risks associated with immunization such as antibody dependent enhancement (ADE). A number of promising advancements have been made toward the development of multiple vaccine candidates. Preliminary data now emerging from phase III clinical trials show encouraging results for the protective efficacy and safety of at least three frontrunning candidates.

OBJECTIVE: To describe the home health recovery of patients with COVID-19 and risk factors associated with rehospitalization or death. DESIGN: Retrospective observational cohort. SETTING: New York City. PARTICIPANTS: 1409 patients with COVID-19 admitted to home health care (HHC) between 1 April and 15 June 2020 after hospitalization. MEASUREMENTS: Covariates and outcomes were obtained from the mandated OASIS (Outcome and Assessment Information Set). Cox proportional hazard models were used to estimate the hazard ratio (HR) of risk factors associated with rehospitalization or death. RESULTS: After an average of 32 days in HHC, 94% of patients were discharged and most achieved statistically significant improvements in symptoms and function. Activity-of-daily-living dependencies decreased from an average of 6 (95% CI, 5.9 to 6.1) to 1.2 (CI, 1.1 to 1.3). Risk for rehospitalization or death was higher for male patients (HR, 1.45 [CI, 1.04 to 2.03]); White patients (HR, 1.74 [CI, 1.22 to 2.47]); and patients with heart failure (HR, 2.12 [CI, 1.41 to 3.19]), diabetes with complications (HR, 1.71 [CI, 1.17 to 2.52]), 2 or more emergency department visits in the past 6 months (HR, 1.78 [CI, 1.21 to 2.62]), pain daily or all the time (HR, 1.46 [CI, 1.05 to 2.05]), cognitive impairment (HR, 1.49 [CI, 1.04 to 2.13]), or functional dependencies (HR, 1.09 [CI, 1.00 to 1.20]). Eleven patients (1%) died, 137 (10%) were rehospitalized, and 23 (2%) remain on service. LIMITATIONS: Care was provided by 1 home health agency. Information on rehospitalization and death after HHC discharge is not available. CONCLUSION: Symptom burden and functional dependence were common at the time of HHC admission but improved for most patients. Comorbid conditions of heart failure and diabetes, as well as characteristics present at admission, identified patients at greatest risk for an adverse event.

MATERIAL AND METHODS This retrospective, single-center observational study included 69 hospitalized patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 from a tertiary hospital in Wuhan, China, between January 14, 2020, and February 26, 2020. Epidemiological, demographic, clinical, and laboratory data, as well as treatments, complications, and outcomes were extracted from electronic medical records and compared between elderly patients (aged &#8805;60 years) and younger patients (aged <60 years). Patients were followed until March 19, 2020. RESULTS Elderly patients had more complications than younger patients, including acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS; 9/25, 36% vs. 5/44, 11.4%) and cardiac injury (7/25, 28% vs. 1/44, 2.3%), and they were more likely to be admitted to the intensive care unit (6/25, 24% vs. 2/44, 4.5%). As of March 19, 2020, 60/69 (87%) of the patients had been discharged, 6/69 (8.7%) had died, and 3/69 (4.3%) remained in the hospital. Of those who were discharged or died, the median duration of hospitalization was 13.5 days (interquartile range, 10-18 days). CONCLUSIONS Elderly patients with confirmed COVID-19 were more likely to develop ARDS and cardiac injury than younger patients and were more likely to be admitted to the intensive care unit. In addition to routine monitoring and respiratory support, cardiac monitoring and supportive care should be a focus in elderly patients with COVID-19.","Song, Jia; Hu, Weihang; Yu, Yihua; Shen, Xin; Wang, Yueben; Yan, Jin; Yang, Xianghong; Gong, Shijin; Wang, Minjia",Med Sci Monit,,344

289374,Optimal control of the SIR model in the presence of transmission and treatment uncertainty,2021,"The COVID-19 pandemic has severely destructed human life worldwide, with no suitable treatment until now. SARS-CoV-2 virus is unprecedented, resistance against number of therapeutics and spreading rapidly with high mortality, which warrants the need to discover new effective drugs to combat this situation. This current study is undertaken to explore the antiviral potential of marine algal compounds to inhibit the viral entry and its multiplication using computational analysis. Among the proven drug discovery targets of SARS-CoV-2, spike glycoprotein and 3-chymotrypsin-like protease are responsible for the virus attachment and viral genome replication in the host cell. In this study, the above-mentioned drug targets were docked with marine algal compounds (sulfated polysaccharides, polysaccharide derivatives and polyphenols) using molecular docking tools (AutoDockTools). The obtained results indicate that &#954;-carrageenan, laminarin, eckol, trifucol and ß-D-galactose are the top-ranking compounds showing better docking scores with SARS-CoV-2 targets, than the current experimental COVID-19 antiviral drugs like dexamethasone, remdesivir, favipiravir and MIV-150. Further, molecular dynamic simulation, ADMET and density functional theory calculations were evaluated to substantiate the findings. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on in silico analysis of aforesaid algal metabolites against SARS-CoV-2 targets. This study concludes that these metabolites can be curative for COVID-19 in the hour of need after further validations in in vitro and in vivo testings.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

289890,GIScience I: Social histories and disciplinary crucibles,2020,"Memory T cells resulting from primary dengue virus (DENV) infection are hypothesized to influence the clinical outcome of subsequent DENV infection. However, the few studies involving prospectively collected blood samples have found weak and inconsistent associations with outcome and variable temporal trends in DENV-specific memory T cell responses between subjects. This study used both ex-vivo and cultured ELISPOT assays to further evaluate the associations between DENV serotype-cross-reactive memory T cells and severity of secondary infection. Using ex-vivo ELISPOT assays, frequencies of memory T cells secreting IFN-Î³ in response to DENV structural and non-structural peptide pools were low in PBMC from multiple time points prior to symptomatic secondary DENV infection and showed a variable response to infection. There were no differences in responses between subjects who were not hospitalized (NH, n=6) and those who were hospitalized with dengue hemorrhagic fever (hDHF, n=4). In contrast, responses in cultured ELISPOT assays were more reliably detectable prior to secondary infection and showed more consistent increases after infection. Responses in cultured ELISPOT assays were higher in individuals with hDHF (n=8) compared to NH (n=9) individuals before the secondary infection, with no difference between these groups after infection. These data demonstrate an association of pre-existing DENV-specific memory responses with the severity of illness in subsequent DENV infection, and suggest that frequencies of DENV-reactive T cells measured after short-term culture may be of particular importance for assessing the risk for more severe dengue disease.","Sanchez-Vargas, Luis Alberto; Anderson, Kathryn B; Srikiatkhachorn, Anon; Currier, Jeffrey R; Friberg, Heather; Endy, Timothy P; Fernandez, Stefan; Mathew, Anuja; Rothman, Alan L",Front Immunol,,344
290608,Turbulent transformation: abrupt societal disruption and climate resilient development,2020,"Given the powerful implications of relationship quality for health and well-being, a central mission of relationship science is explaining why some romantic relationships thrive more than others. This large-scale project used machine learning (i.e., Random Forests) to 1) quantify the extent to which relationship quality is predictable and 2) identify which constructs reliably predict relationship quality. Across 43 dyadic longitudinal datasets from 29 laboratories, the top relationship-specific predictors of relationship quality were perceived-partner commitment, appreciation, sexual satisfaction, perceived-partner satisfaction, and conflict. The top individual-difference predictors were life satisfaction, negative affect, depression, attachment avoidance, and attachment anxiety. Overall, relationship-specific variables predicted up to 45% of variance at baseline, and up to 18% of variance at the end of each study. Individual differences also performed well (21% and 12%, respectively). Actor-reported variables (i.e., own relationship-specific and individual-difference variables) predicted two to four times more variance than partner-reported variables (i.e., the partner's ratings on those variables). Importantly, individual differences and partner reports had no predictive effects beyond actor-reported relationship-specific variables alone. These findings imply that the sum of all individual differences and partner experiences exert their influence on relationship quality via a person's own relationship-specific experiences, and effects due to moderation by individual differences and moderation by partner-reports may be quite small. Finally, relationship-quality change (i.e., increases or decreases in relationship quality over the course of a study) was largely unpredictable from any combination of self-report variables. This collective effort should guide future models of relationships.","Joel, Samantha; Eastwick, Paul W; Allison, Colleen J; Arriaga, Ximena B; Baker, Zachary G; Bar-Kalifa, Eran; Bergeron, Sophie; Birnbaum, Gurit E; Brock, Rebecca L; Brumbaugh, Claudia C; Carmichael, Cheryl L; Chen, Serena; Clarke, Jennifer; Cobb, Rebecca J; Coolsen, Michael K; Davis, Jody; de Jong, David C; Debrot, Anik; DeHaas, Eva C; Derrick, Jaye L; Eller, Jami; Estrada, Marie-Joelle; Faure, Ruddy; Finkel, Eli J; Fraley, R Chris; Gable, Shelly L; Gadassi-Polack, Reuma; Girme, Yuthika U; Gordon, Amie M; Gosnell, Courtney L; Hammond, Matthew D; Hannon, Peggy A; Harasymchuk, Cheryl; Hofmann, Wilhelm; Horn, Andrea B; Impett, Emily A; Jamieson, Jeremy P; Keltner, Dacher; Kim, James J; Kirchner, Jeffrey L; Kluwer, Esther S; Kumashiro, Madoka; Larson, Grace; Lazarus, Gal; Logan, Jill M; Luchies, Laura B; MacDonald, Geoff; Machia, Laura V; Maniaci, Michael R; Maxwell, Jessica A",Proc.

The therapeutic goal is to reduce the risk of relapse. Factors associated with relapses can help to manage and prevent relapses. In addition, patients and doctors all pay attention to it. However, there are differences between studies. Our aim is to summarize factors associated with relapses in relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS). METHODS: PubMed, EMBASE, Web of science, Cochrane library, CNKI, Wanfang, SinoMed, and VIP were searched to identify risk factors about relapses in RRMS, which should be in cohort or case-control studies. This article was reported according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA). The quality of studies was evaluated by the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS). Meta-analysis, subgroup and sensitivity analyses, and publication bias were all performed with Stata. This research has been registered on the international prospective register of systematic reviews (PROSPERO, CRD42019120502). RESULTS: 43 articles were included. Infection, postpartum period, risk gene, stress, and vitamin D were risk factors for relapses in RRMS. Pregnancy period was the protective factor. Among those, infection increased the risk of relapses in infection period (relative risk [RR], 2.07 [confidence interval (CI), 1.64 to 2.60]). Women in the postpartum period increased the risk of relapses compared with women before pregnancy (RR, 1.43 [CI, 1.19 to 1.72]), or women in pregnancy period (RR, 2.07 [CI, 1.49 to 2.88]). Women in the pregnancy period decreased the risk of relapses (RR, 0.56 [CI, 0.37 to 0.84]) compared with women before pregnancy. However, fewer studies, heterogeneity, and sample size were the limitations. CONCLUSION: It is reliable to adopt results about infection, pregnancy period, and postpartum period.","Xie, Yao; Tian, Ziyu; Han, Fang; Liang, Shibing; Gao, Ying; Wu, Dahua",Medicine (Baltimore),,344

297190,Fractional-Order SIR Epidemic Model for Transmission Prediction of COVID-19 Disease,2020,"We present a method for rapid calculation of coronavirus growth rates and R-numbers tailored to the publicly available data in the UK. The R-number is derived from time-series of case data, using bespoke data processing to remove systematic and errors and stochastic fluctuations. In principle, growth rate can be obtained by differentiating the reported case numbers, but in fact daily stochastic fluctuations disqualify this method. We therefore assume that the case data comprises a smooth, underlying trend which is differentiable and a noise term. The approach produces, up-to-date estimates of the R-number throughout the period of data availability. Our method is validated against published consensus R-numbers from the UK government, and shown to produce comparable results. A significant advantage of our method is that it is stable up to the most recent data, this enables us to make R-number estimates available over two weeks ahead of the published consensus. The short-lived peaks observed in the R-number and case data cannot be explained by a well-mixed model and are suggestive of spread on a localised network. Such a localised spread model tends to give an Rt number close to 1, regardless of how large R0 is. The case-driven approach is combined with Weight-Shift-Scale (WSS) methods to monitor trends in the epidemic and for medium term predictions. Using case-fatality ratios, we create a narrative for trends in the UK epidemic increased infectiousness of the alpha and delta variants, and the effectiveness of vaccination in reducing severity of infection.","Ackland, Graeme J; Ackland, James A; Antonioletti, Mario; Wallace, David J",,,344

Equivalent doses in organs were estimated using both treatment planning system calculations and a peripheral dose model (based on ionization chamber measurements). Skin dose was estimated using radiochromic films. Later, effective dose and LAR were calculated following radiation protection procedures. RESULTS: Equivalent doses to organs per unit of prescription dose range from 10 mSv/cGy to 0.0051 mSv/cGy. Effective doses range from 204 mSv to 426 mSv, for prescription doses ranging from 50 cGy to 100 cGy. Total LAR for a prescription dose of 50 cGy ranges from 1.7 to 0.29% for male and from 4.9 to 0.54% for female, for ages ranging from 20 to 80 years old. CONCLUSIONS: The organs that mainly contribute to risk are lung and breast. Risk for out-of-field organs is low, less than 0.06 cases per 10000. Female LAR is on average 2.2 times that of a male of the same age. Effective doses are of the same order of magnitude as the higher-dose interventional radiology techniques. For a 60 year-old male, LAR is 8 times that from a cardiac CT, when prescription dose is 50 cGy.","García-Hernández, Trinitat; Romero-Expósito, Maite; Sánchez-Nieto, Beatriz",Radiother Oncol,,344

298898,A Unified Framework for Task-Driven Data Quality Management,2021-06-10,"OBJECTIVE: Social distancing is crucial in order to flatten the curve of COVID-19 virus spreading. Isolation, scarcity of resources and the lack of social contacts may have produced a negative impact on people's emotions and psychological well-being. This study aims to explore the reasons and the ways through which social distancing generates negative emotions in individuals who experienced the lockdown. To a larger extent, the objective is to check the existence of relations between negative emotions and the satisfaction of basic needs. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In Italy 140,656 online interviews were collected from March 22 to April 2, 2020. Data analysis was carried out using mono and bivariate statistical analysis, K-means clustering and the Principal Components Analysis (PCA). The parameters for the identification of six clusters were: the intensity of the respondent's basic emotions and the layers of Maslow's hierarchy of needs. RESULTS: The majority of people involved in an emergency situation, implying a collapse of social contacts, experience some kind of emotional reactions. In our study, we found a correlation between basic emotions and Maslow's hierarchy of needs. In times of crisis, the most basic needs are the physiological ones. Fear, anger and sadness are predominant in all population groups; anger and disgust mainly appear when people are exposed to the risk of not being able to meet subsistence needs, thus perceiving a lack of economic security. CONCLUSIONS: The well-known Maslow's theory of human needs seems to fit well with the outbreak of negative emotions in the context of COVID-19. This study demonstrates the existence of links between negative emotions and primary needs that mainly refer to the first three levels of Maslow's pyramid. As a result of COVID-19 worldwide pandemic, many people have been sucked into the bottom layers of the pyramid. This change in individual basic needs has triggered a relevant transformation in individual emotional status and a shift towards negative emotions.","Cerbara, L; Ciancimino, G; Crescimbene, M; La Longa, F; Parsi, M R; Tintori, A; Palomba, R",Eur Rev Med Pharmacol Sci,,344

298986,Comprehensive Knowledge of Reservoir Hosts is Key to Mitigate Future Pandemics,2020,"The formation of chemical and biological heterogeneity in lakes can be favored by physical and morphometric constrains. This study describes the results of four whole-lake field campaigns carried out in Lake Como (north Italy) during thermal stratification. The aim was to analyze the distribution of chemical-biological variables in a multi-basin lake as a result of internal and external physical drivers and constrains. Lake Como has a y-like shape encompassing three main sub-basins: northern, south-eastern, and south-western. Field data underlined: the presence of chemical-biological gradients between the south-western basin and the rest of the lake and the propagation of a fresher water-plume (formed by the two main northern inflows) into the northern basin and then into the south-western closed arm. The use of a three-dimensional hydrodynamic model showed a periodic movement of this plume that tends to enter the south-western basin first and then to return toward north, moving forward and back through the junction of the three arms. The entrance into the eastern basin, instead, occurs only secondarily. Wavelet transform analysis revealed common periodicity between the plume movement and the action of different external and internal lake-stressors, including: the discharge of the main inflow (period centered at 1, 3.3, and 6.5 day), the wind intensity (0.5 and 1 day) and the two main basin-scale internal wave motions: (3.3 day and 7.1 day). The periodic movement of the fresher water-plume enhances the water exchange and reduces the chemical-biological gradients between the western closed basin and the main lake, playing a crucial role in distributing both inorganic and organic materials at the lake basin-scale.","Copetti, Diego; Guyennon, Nicolas; Buzzi, Fabio",Sci Total Environ,,344

En assurant la validation pharmaceutique des prescriptions, le pharmacien procède à la formulation des interventions pharmaceutiques (IP) qui visent à optimiser la prise en charge médicamenteuse du patient. L'objectif de notre travail était d'évaluer le type et le taux d'acceptation des IP faites par le pharmacien au sein du service de médecine interne. Il s'agit d'une étude prospective de l'ensemble des prescriptions médicales du service de médecine interne sur une période de cinq mois allant du 20 septembre 2020 au 20 février 2021. Les prescriptions ont été validées quotidiennement par l'interne en pharmacie sous la responsabilité du résident en pharmacie et du pharmacien clinicien. Les IP réalisées ont été notifiées selon le modèle de la fiche des IP de la société française de pharmacie clinique version 6. L'analyse pharmaceutique des prescriptions médicamenteuses a abouti à la formulation de 34 IP parmi les quelles 58 % ont été acceptées par le prescripteur. Les problèmes fréquemment rencontrés correspondaient à un problème de posologie (55 %), à des interactions médicamenteuses (14,7 %) et à l'indisponibilité du médicament (8,8 %). Face à ces problèmes les IP proposées étaient une adaptation posologique (62 %), un changement de médicament (12 %) et une amélioration des méthodes de dispensation (11 %). Un total de 31.4 % des IP faite ont concerné les patients atteints de pneumopathie COVID-19. La non acceptation de nos interventions par les prescripteurs a été dans 27 % sans motif et dans 15 % avec motif. Le taux d'acceptation assez satisfaisant des IP témoigne de l'importance de la coopération médecin- pharmacien pour la réduction de la durée d'hospitalisation des patients. En effet, la présence du pharmacien clinicien au sein même du service de soin s'inscrit dans les démarches actuelles d'optimisation de la prise en charge médicamenteuse du patient. Elle permet de diminuer l'iatrogénie médicamenteuse et d'augmenter l'efficacité de la prise en charge thérapeutique.

299657,World News,2021,"OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to examine contamination from otolaryngologic procedures involving high-speed drilling, specifically mastoid surgery, and to assess the adequacy of PPE in such procedures. DESIGN AND SETTING: Mastoid surgery was simulated in a dry laboratory using a plastic temporal bone, microscope and handheld drill with irrigation and suction. Comparisons of distance of droplet and bone dust contamination and surgeon contamination were made under differing conditions. Irrigation speed, use of microscope and drill burr size and type were compared. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Measurement of the distance of field contamination while performing simulated mastoidectomy and location of surgeon contamination. RESULTS: There was a greater distance field contamination and surgeon contamination without the use of the microscope. Contamination was reduced by using a smaller drill burr and by using a diamond burr when compared to a cutting burr. The use of goggles and a face mask provided good protection for the surgeon. However, the microscope alone may provide sufficient protection to negate the need for goggles. CONCLUSIONS: While the risks of performing mastoid surgery during the coronavirus pandemic cannot be completely removed, they can be mitigated. Such factors include using the microscope for all drilling, using smaller size drill burrs and creating a safe zone around the operating table.","Markey, Anne L; Leong, Samuel C; Vaughan, Casey",Clin Otolaryngol,,344

300491,Real-time estimation of distance between people and/or objects in video surveillance,2020,"BACKGROUND: For patients with bilateral pulmonary metastases, staged resections have historically been the preferred surgical intervention. During the spring of 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic made patient travel to the hospital challenging and necessitated reduction in operative volume so that resources could be conserved. We report our experience with synchronous bilateral metastasectomies for the treatment of disease in both lungs. METHODS: Patients with bilateral pulmonary metastases who underwent simultaneous bilateral resections were compared with a cohort of patients who underwent staged resections. We used nearest-neighbor propensity score (1:1) matching to adjust for confounders. Perioperative outcomes were compared between groups using paired statistical analysis techniques. RESULTS: Between 1998 and 2020, 36 patients underwent bilateral simultaneous metastasectomies. We matched 31 pairs of patients. The length of stay was significantly shorter in patients undergoing simultaneous resection (median 3 vs. 8 days, p < .001) and operative time was shorter (156 vs. 235.5 min, p < .001) when compared to the sum of both procedures in the staged group. The groups did not significantly differ with regard to postoperative complications. CONCLUSION: In a carefully selected patient population, simultaneous bilateral metastasectomy is a safe option. A single procedure confers benefits for both the patient as well as the hospital resource system.","Feldman, Hope A; Zhou, Nicolas; Antonoff, Mara B; Hofstetter, Wayne L; Rajaram, Ravi; Rice, David C; Sepesi, Boris; Vaporciyan, Ara A; Zorrilla-Vaca, Andres; Mehran, Reza J",J. surg. oncol,,344

302267,Dynamics of SIR model with heterogeneous response to intervention policy,2021-03-14,"Syncope represents a relatively uncommon symptom of supraventricular tachycardia (SVT). It is likely that an impaired autonomic vasomotor response to the hemodynamic stress of tachycardia is the determinant of hemodynamic changes leading to cerebral hypoperfusion and syncope. In this regard, tilt-table test may detect abnormalities in the autonomic nervous function and predict the occurrence of syncope during SVT. Electrophysiology studies may reproduce the SVT, distinguish it from other life-threatening ventricular tachyarrhythmias, and exclude other causes of syncope. Not infrequently mixed syncope mechanisms are revealed during the above diagnostic workup raising doubts about the operating mechanism in the clinical setting. In such cases of uncertainty, an implantable loop recorder, providing long-term cardiac monitoring, may play a pivotal role in the establishment of the diagnosis, confirming the association of an arrhythmic event with the symptom. Herein, we present four such cases with recurrent unexplained syncope finally attributed to paroxysmal SVT guiding them to a potentially radical treatment through radiofrequency catheter ablation.","Soulaidopoulos, Stergios; Arsenos, Petros; Doundoulakis, Ioannis; Tsiachris, Dimitrios; Antoniou, Christos-Konstantinos; Dilaveris, Polychronis; Fragakis, Nikolaos; Sotiriadou, Melani; Sideris, Skevos; Kordalis, Athanasios; Laina, Ageliki; Tousoulis, Dimitrios; Tsioufis, Konstantinos; Gatzoulis, Konstantinos A",Ann Noninvasive Electrocardiol,,344
302821,Nash SIR: An Economic-Epidemiological Model of Strategic Behavior During a Viral Epidemic,2020-06-17,"The COVID-19 pandemic has left its marks in the sports world, forcing the full-stop of all sports-related activities in the first half of 2020. Football leagues were suddenly stopped and each country was hesitating between a relaunch of the competition and a premature ending. Some opted for the latter option, and took as the final standing of the season the ranking from the moment the competition got interrupted. This decision has been perceived as unfair, especially by those teams who had remaining matches against easier opponents. In this paper, we introduce a tool to calculate in a fairer way the final standings of domestic leagues that have to stop prematurely: our Probabilistic Final Standing Calculator (PFSC). It is based on a stochastic model taking into account the results of the matches played and simulating the remaining matches, yielding the probabilities for the various possible final rankings. We have compared our PFSC with state-of-the-art prediction models, using previous seasons which we pretend to stop at different points in time. We illustrate our PFSC by showing how a probabilistic ranking of the French Ligue 1 in the stopped 2019-2020 season could have led to alternative, potentially fairer, decisions on the final standing.","Eetvelde, Hans Van; Hvattum, Lars Magnus; Ley, Christophe",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.10597v1.pdf,344

The aim of this study was to verify whether there was an association between low skeletal muscle index and in-hospital mortality, intensive care unit admission, and invasive mechanical ventilation need in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. DESIGN: This was a retrospective cohort study of a referral center for COVID-19. We included all consecutive patients admitted to the hospital between February 26 and May 15, 2020, with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19. Skeletal muscle index was assessed from a transverse computed tomography image at the level of twelfth thoracic vertebra with National Institutes of Health ImageJ software, and statistical analysis was performed to find an association between skeletal muscle index and in-hospital mortality, need of invasive mechanical ventilation, and intensive care unit admission. RESULTS: We included 519 patients, the median age was 51 (42-61) yrs, and 115 patients (22%) had low skeletal muscle index. On multivariable analysis, skeletal muscle index was not associated with mortality, intensive care unit admission, or invasive mechanical ventilation need nor in a subanalysis of patients 65 yrs or older. CONCLUSIONS: Skeletal muscle index determined by computed tomography at the level of twelfth thoracic vertebra was not associated with negative outcomes in hospitalized patients with COVID-19.","Moctezuma-Velázquez, Paulina; Miranda-Zazueta, Godolfino; Ortiz-Brizuela, Edgar; González-Lara, María Fernanda; Tamez-Torres, Karla Maria; Román-Montes, Carla Marina; Díaz-Mejía, Bruno Alejandro; Pérez-García, Esteban; Villanueva-Reza, Marco; Tovar-Méndez, Víctor Hugo; Medrano-Borromeo, Carla; Martínez-Valenzuela, Alejandra; Jandete-Medina, Míguel Ángel; Martínez-Guerra, Bernardo Alonso; Uscanga-Domínguez, Luis; Sifuentes-Osornio, José; Ponce-de-León, Alfredo; Olivas-Martinez, Antonio; Moctezuma-Velázquez, Carlos",Am J Phys Med Rehabil,,344

305379,Intro: Comparative Capitalism Research in Emerging Markets – A New Generation,2020,"Coronaviruses belonging to the Coronaviridae family are single-stranded RNA viruses. The entry of SARS-CoV-2 is accomplished via ACE-2 receptors. SARS-CoV-2 infection coactivates both innate and adaptive immune responses. Although SARS-CoV-2 stimulates antibody production with a typical pattern of IgM/IgG, cellular immunity is also impaired. In severe cases, low CD4 + and CD8 + T cell counts are associated with impaired immune functions, and high neutrophil/lymphocyte ratios accompanying low lymphocyte subsets have been demonstrated. Recently, high IFN -&#945;/Î³ ratios with impaired T cell responses, and increased IL-1, IL-6, TNF-&#945;, MCP-1, IP-10, IL-4, IL-10 have been reported in COVID-19 infection. Increased proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines in patients with severe COVID-19 may cause the suppression of CD4 + and CD8 + T cells and regulatory T cells, causing excessive inflammatory responses and fatal cytokine storm with tissue and organ damage. Consequently, novel therapeutics to be developed against host immune system, including blockade of cytokines (IL-6, IL-1, IFN) themselves, their receptors or signaling pathways- JAK inhibitors- could be effective as potential therapeutics.","Tascioglu, Didem; Akkaya, Emre; Genc, Sema",Scand J Clin Lab Invest,,344
305408,Statistical Analysis of Dispelling Rumors on Sina Weibo,2020,"Malignant solid tumors are the leading cause of death in humans, and epigenetic regulation plays a significant role in studying the mechanism of human solid tumors. Recently, histone lysine methylation has been demonstrated to be involved in the development of human solid tumors due to its epigenetic stability and some other advantages. The 90-kb protein methyltransferase nuclear receptor SET domain-containing 2 (NSD2) is a member of nuclear receptor SET domain-containing (NSD) protein lysine methyltransferase (KMT) family, which can cause epigenomic aberrations via altering the methylation states. Studies have shown that NSD2 is frequently over-expressed in multiple types of aggressive solid tumors, including breast cancer, renal cancer, prostate cancer, cervical cancer, and osteosarcoma, and such up-regulation has been linked to poor prognosis and recurrence. Further studies have identified that over-expression of NSD2 promotes cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and epithelial-mesenchymal transformation (EMT), suggesting its potential oncogenic role in solid tumors. Moreover, Gene Expression Profiling Interactive Analysis (GEPIA) was searched for validation of prognostic value of NSD2 in human solid tumors. However, the underlying specific mechanism remains unclear. In our present work, we summarized the latest advances in NSD2 expression and clinical applications in solid tumors, and our findings provided valuable insights into the targeted therapeutic regimens of solid tumors.","Chen, Rui; Chen, Yan; Zhao, Weiqing; Fang, Cheng; Zhou, Wenjie; Yang, Xin; Ji, Mei",Onco Targets Ther,,344

306010,Call for Contributions,2020,"OBJECTIVES: In December 2019, a novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) emerged in Wuhan city, China, which has subsequently led to a global pandemic. At the time of writing, COVID-19 in Wuhan appears to be in the final phase and under control. However, many other countries, especially the US, Italy and Spain, are still in the early phases and dealing with increasing cases every day. Therefore, this article aims to summarise and share the experience of controlling the spread of COVID-19 in Wuhan and provide effective suggestions to enable other countries to save lives. STUDY DESIGN: Data from the National Health Commission of China are used to investigate the evolution trajectory of COVID-19 in Wuhan and discuss the impacts of the intervention strategies. METHODS: A four-stage modified Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Removed (SEIR) model is presented. This model considers many influencing factors, including chunyun (the Spring festival), sealing off the city and constructing the Fangcang shelter hospitals. In addition, a novel method is proposed to address the abnormal data on 12-13 February as a result of changing diagnostic criteria. Four different scenarios are considered to capture different intervention measures in practice. The exposed population in Wuhan who moved out before sealing off the city have also been identified, and an analysis on where they had gone was performed using the Baidu Migration Index. RESULTS: The results demonstrate that the four-stage model was effective in forecasting the peak, size and duration of COVID-19. We found that the combined intervention measures are the only effective way to control the spread and not a single one of them can be omitted. We estimate that England will be another epicentre owing to its incorrect response at the initial stages of COVID-19. Fortunately, big data technology can help provide early warnings to new areas of the pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: The four-stage SEIR model was effective in capturing the evolution trajectory of COVID-19. Based on the model analysis, several effective suggestions are proposed to prevent and control the pandemic for countries that are still in the initial phases.","Liu, M; Ning, J; Du, Y; Cao, J; Zhang, D; Wang, J; Chen, M",Public Health,,344

306965,Neanderthal DNA highlights complexity of COVID risk factors,2020,"The coronaviruses (CoVs), including SARS-CoV-2, the agent of the ongoing deadly CoVID-19 pandemic (Coronavirus disease-2019), represent a highly complex and diverse class of RNA viruses with large genomes, complex gene repertoire, and intricate transcriptional and translational mechanisms. The 3'-terminal one-third of the genome encodes four structural proteins, namely spike, envelope, membrane, and nucleocapsid, interspersed with genes for accessory proteins that are largely nonstructural and called 'open reading frame' (ORF) proteins with alphanumerical designations, but not in a consistent or sequential order. Here, I report a comparative study of these ORF proteins, mainly encoded in two gene clusters, i.e. between the Spike and the Envelope genes, and between the Membrane and the Nucleocapsid genes. For brevity and focus, a greater emphasis was placed on the first cluster, collectively designated as the 'orf3 region' for ease of referral. Overall, an apparently diverse set of ORFs, such as ORF3a, ORF3b, ORF3c, ORF3d, ORF4 and ORF5, but not necessarily numbered in that order on all CoV genomes, were analyzed along with other ORFs. Unexpectedly, the gene order or naming of the ORFs were never fully conserved even within the members of one Genus. These studies also unraveled hitherto unrecognized orf genes in alternative translational frames, encoding potentially novel polypeptides as well as some that are highly similar to known ORFs. Finally, several options of an inclusive and systematic numbering are proposed not only for the orf3 region but also for the other orf genes in the viral genome in an effort to regularize the apparently confusing names and orders. Regardless of the ultimate acceptability of one system over the others, this treatise is hoped to initiate an informed discourse in this area.","Barik, Sailen",Infect Genet Evol,,344

Rapid antigen tests for infectious diseases are useful to prevent the pandemic spread in clinical settings. METHODS: We evaluated a SARS-CoV-2 antigen test, Espline® SARS-CoV-2 reagent, with reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) as reference test, using 129 nasopharyngeal swab specimens collected from COVID-19 hospitalized patients or from patients suspected having COVID-19-like symptoms. Out of these, 63 RT-PCR positive and 66 RT-PCR negative specimens were identified. RESULTS: Among 63 RT-PCR positive specimens, 25 were positive in the Espline test. Test sensitivity was estimated based on the 532.4 copies/reaction of SARS-CoV-2 RNA obtained through receiver operating characteristic analysis. When the specimens were classified based on time since symptom onset, Espline test sensitivity were 73.3% and 29.2% in specimens collected before day 9 and after day 10, respectively. CONCLUSION: Although the overall sensitivity of the Espline® SARS-CoV-2 reagent compared with RT-PCR is less, this antigen test can be useful in identifying people with high risk of virus transmission with high viral loads in order to prevent the pandemic and is useful for diagnosing COVID-19 within 30 min.","Aoki, Kotaro; Nagasawa, Tatsuya; Ishii, Yoshikazu; Yagi, Shintaro; Kashiwagi, Katsuhito; Miyazaki, Taito; Tateda, Kazuhiro",J Infect Chemother,,344

The Case of Silicon Valley North in Ontario, Canada",2021,"BACKGROUND: Acute kidney injury (AKI) in coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) has high incidence and mortality. Risk factors for AKI in COVID-19 patients are not well explored. This systematic review provides a combination of available evidence regarding risk factors of AKI in COVID-19 patients. METHODS: A systematic research was performed in Medline, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and ScienceDirect journal databases from 2019 to August 2020. The study selection process was plotted using a Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analyses flow diagram. RESULTS: Out of 553 studies found, four full-text studies met the inclusion criteria and were included in qualitative analysis. There are 2205 COVID-19 patients with AKI (36.44%) from 6051 COVID-19 patients. Age was a risk factors for AKI in two studies (odds ratio [OR] 1.03 [p &lt; 0.001], OR 1.03 [p &lt; 0.007]). Critical condition of patient is risk factors for AKI (OR 8.155 [p = 0.006]). Hirsch et al. stated that diabetes mellitus (OR 1.74 [p &lt; 0.001]), cardiovascular disease (OR 1.48 [p &lt; 0.001]), and hypertension (OR 1.25 [p = 0.02]) are also risk factors. Laboratory results such as elevated procalcitonin (PCT) and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) &lt;60 ml/min/1.73 m2 showed positive association to AKI in COVID-19 patients (OR 4.822 [p = 0.037];OR 13.451 [p = 0.016]). A higher sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score at admission is one of the risk factors (OR 1.498 [p = 0.027]). CONCLUSION: Demographics, clinical classification of COVID-19, comorbidities, SOFA score, PCT, and eGFR can help clinicians predict AKI in COVID-19 patients.","Daniella, D.; Kandarini, Y.; Mahadita, G.

308469,Accurate closed-form solution of the SIR epidemic model,2020,"The environmental impact of training has been poorly recognised for many years. With the emergence of high-profile climate activists and a wider appreciation of the need for sustainable healthcare, training within radiology can no longer be excused from its responsibility to consider the environment in its actions. In this paper, we aim to evaluate the environmental impact of the travel undertaken by trainees within the Peninsula training programme, with the aim of developing practices and providing suggestions (evidence-based where possible) on how to improve the impact on the environment of trainee travel. We envisage that many of the lessons and suggestions may be transferrable to other training schemes in the UK and further afield. During the early months of 2020, in addition to the environmental crisis, COVID-19 escalated to a pandemic resulting in the alteration of working practices across the UK (and the rest of the world). This led to many environmentally beneficial working practices being adopted in Radiology in the South West Peninsula Deanery, and throughout this paper we have evaluated these changes and used our collective experience of these to inform our suggestions on how to improve the environmental sustainability of Medical and Radiological training.","Peters, Seren; Burrows, Susan; Jenkins, Paul",Postgrad. med. j,,344

Viral concentration maps showing spatial and temporal changes are provided based on a biophysical model under multiple scenarios. Results demonstrate that adjacent sea areas can become exposed to SARS-CoV-2 via water-borne transport from outfalls, with a higher risk in winter, because SARS-CoV-2 can be highly stable at low temperature. As coastal waters are the ultimate sink for wastewater and the epidemic will last for long time, this work is of great importance to raise awareness, identify vulnerable areas for marine mammals, and avoid the risk of exposure of tourists at bathing beach.","Guo, Weijun; Cao, Yimeng; Kong, Xiangpeng; Kong, Shujun; Xu, Tiaojian",Ecotoxicol Environ Saf,,344

We also review the philosophical and practical underpinnings of crisis standards of care and describe historical approaches to scarce resource allocation to offer analysis and guidance for pediatric clinicians. Particular attention is given to the impact on children of this endeavor. Although few children have required hospitalization for symptomatic infection, children nonetheless have the potential to be profoundly affected by the strain on the health care system imposed by the pandemic and should be considered prospectively in resource allocation frameworks.","Laventhal, Naomi; Basak, Ratna; Dell, Mary Lynn; Diekema, Douglas; Elster, Nanette; Geis, Gina; Mercurio, Mark; Opel, Douglas; Shalowitz, David; Statter, Mindy; Macauley, Robert",Pediatrics,,344

Alterations on both their sugar and the heterocyclic parts may lead to significant changes in the spectrum of their biological activity and the degree of selective toxicity, as well as in their physicochemical properties. Method: C5-arylalkynyl-β-D-ribofuranonucleosides 3-6, 3΄-deoxy 12-15, 3΄-deoxy-3΄-C-methyl-β-D-ribofurananucleosides 18-21 and 2΄-deoxy-β-D-ribofuranonucleosides 23-26 of uracil, were synthesized using a one-step Sonogashira reaction under microwave irradiation and subsequent deprotection. Results: All newly synthesized nucleosides were tested for their antitumor or antiviral activity. Moderate cytostatic activity against cervix carcinoma (HeLa), murine leukemia (L1210) and human lymphocyte (CEM) tumor cell lines was displayed by the protected 3΄-deoxy derivatives 12b, 12c, 12d, and the 3΄-deoxy-3΄-methyl 18a, 18b, 18c.

312738,The long haul,2020,"AIMS: In three days at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Copenhagen Emergency Medical Services developed a digital diagnostic device. The purpose was to assess and triage potential COVID-19 symptoms and to reduce the number of calls to public health-care helplines. The device was used almost 150,000 times in a few weeks and was described by politicians and administrators as a solution and success. However, high usage cannot serve as the sole criterion of success. What might be adequate criteria? And should digital triage for citizens by default be considered low risk? METHODS: This paper reflects on the uncertain aspects of the performance, risks and issues of accountability pertaining to the digital diagnostic device in order to draw lessons for future improvements. The analysis is based on the principles of evidence-based medicine (EBM), the EU and US regulations of medical devices and the taxonomy of uncertainty in health care by Han et al. RESULTS: Lessons for future digital devices are (a) the need for clear criteria of success, (b) the importance of awareness of other severe diseases when triaging, (c) the priority of designing the device to collect data for evaluation and (d) clear allocation of responsibilities. CONCLUSIONS: A device meant to substitute triage for citizens according to its own criteria of success should not by default be considered as low risk. In a pandemic age dependent on digitalisation, it is therefore important not to abandon the ethos of EBM, but instead to prepare the ground for new ways of building evidence of effect.","Haase, Christoffer Bjerre; Bearman, Margaret; Brodersen, John; Hoeyer, Klaus; Risor, Torsten",Scand J Public Health,,344

Thailand's response to the COVID-19 pandemic has been guided by the ""Integrated Plan for Multilateral Cooperation for Safety and Mitigation of COVID-19"". This paper analyses the health resources in the country and focuses on the response through community-level public health system and legislative measures. The paper draws some lessons on future preparedness, especially with respect to the four priorities of Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction. At the end, the paper puts some key learning for future preparedness. While Thailand's response to COVID-19 has been effective in limiting the spread of the disease, it falls short at being able to address the multiple dimensions of the crisis such as the economic and social impacts. The socioeconomic sectors have been hardest hit, with significant impact on tourism sectors. Sociopolitical system also plays an important role in governance and decision-making for pandemic responses. The analysis suggests that one opportunity for enhancing resilience in Thailand is to strive for more multilevel governance that engages with various stakeholders and to support grassroots and community-level networks. The COVID-19 pandemic recovery is a chance to recover better while leaving no one behind. An inclusive long-term recovery plan for the various impacted countries needs to take a holistic approach to address existing gaps and work towards a sustainable society.

The neoplastic cells were positive with BCL2, BCL6, CD10 and CD20, and were negative with CD3, CD5, Cyclin D1 and SOX11. CT staging showed disseminated lymphadenopathy and the patient was commenced on chemotherapy. Endoscopic evaluation and histopathological analysis are vital for the accurate diagnosis of MLP. Our case demonstrates that follicular lymphoma should be considered as a differential, as not all cases of diffuse colonic MLP are related to mantle cell lymphoma. This distinction must be made to provide the best clinical management for the patient.","Ng, Hwei Jene; Schmigylski, Rudi; Nale, Krsty; Collins, Patrick",BMJ case reports,,344

Currently, there are no FDA approved drugs available that slow NASH progression or address NASH liver involvement in COVID-19. Since animal models cannot fully recapitulate human NASH, we hypothesized that stem cells isolated directly from end-stage NASH patient liver may address current knowledge gaps in human NASH pathology. APPROACH AND RESULTS: We devised methods allowing derivation, proliferation, hepatic differentiation and extensive characterization of bipotent ductal organoids from irreversibly damaged NASH patient liver.

316575,The paradoxes of pandemics,2020,"Teicoplanin has a potential antiviral activity expressed against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and was suggested as a complementary option to treat coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients. In this multicentric, retrospective, observational research the aim was to evaluate the impact of teicoplanin on the course of COVID-19 in critically ill patients. Fifty-five patients with severe COVID-19, hospitalized in the intensive care units (ICUs) and treated with best available therapy were retrospectively analysed. Among them 34 patients were also treated with teicoplanin (Tei-COVID group), while 21 without teicoplanin (control group). Crude in-hospital Day-30 mortality was lower in Tei-COVID group (35.2%) than in control group (42.8%), however not reaching statistical significance (p = .654). No statistically significant differences in length of stay in the ICU were observed between Tei-COVID group and control group (p = .248). On Day 14 from the ICU hospitalization, viral clearance was achieved in 64.7% patients of Tei-COVID group and 57.1% of control group, without statistical difference. Serum C-reactive protein level was significantly reduced in Tei-COVID group compared to control group, but not other biochemical parameters. Finally, Gram-positive were the causative pathogens for 25% of BSIs in Tei-COVID group and for 70.6% in controls. No side effects related to teicoplanin use were observed. Despite several limitations require further research, in this study the use of teicoplanin is not associated with a significant improvement in outcomes analysed. The antiviral activity of teicoplanin against SARS-CoV-2, previously documented, is probably more effective at early clinical stages.","Ceccarelli, Giancarlo; Alessandri, Francesco; Oliva, Alessandra; Borrazzo, Cristian; Dell039,; Isola, Serena; Ialungo, Anna Maria; Rastrelli, Elena; Pelli, Massimiliano; Raponi, Giammarco; Turriziani, Ombretta; Ruberto, Franco; Rocco, Monica; Pugliese, Francesco; Russo, Alessandro; d039,; Ettorre, Gabriella; Venditti, Mario",J. med. virol,,344

The study of loneliness among young adults has become increasingly important considering the current state of isolation and stay-at-home orders issued to prevent the spread of COVID-19. Preliminary reports suggest an increase in loneliness as a result of the current health pandemic, especially among young adults, who have reported feeling lonelier than any other age group. Such findings warrant the study of ways to help reduce loneliness among young adults. The current study examined the efficacy of strategies that might be used to help young adults manage feelings of loneliness. Two hundred and seventy-eight young adults completed the study. Participants read one of four messages: mindfulness, social cognitions, coping behaviors, or a control. Participants in the mindfulness condition felt better equipped to manage future instances of loneliness and held better attitudes toward this intervention. The current research helps to advance understanding of effective ways of helping young adults cope with loneliness.","Besse, Robin; Whitaker, Whitney K; Brannon, Laura A",Psychol Rep,,344

Increased measles incidence rates and considerable disease burden have been observed in under-vaccinated communities, predominantly Jewish ultraorthodox. The measles epidemic, despite proper public health handling, revealed susceptible population subgroups as well as gaps and lacking resources in the Israeli public health systems. In the COVID-19 pandemic in Israel, as of December 2020, the number of COVID-19 cases reported nationally was over 300,000 with approximately 3000 fatalities. Notably, minority groups such as the ultraorthodox Jewish community and the Arab community in Israel has been profoundly affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. We believe it is still possible to implement the key lessons from the measles outbreak in Israel that could aid in the COVID-19 response in Israel and elsewhere. These conceptions should include a social-based approach, investment in public health human resources and infrastructure, tackling root causes of inequalities, emphasis on trust and solidarity, proactive communication, need for political will, and proper use of epidemiological data as a basis for decision-making.

To identify VSN BA receptors, we first performed a deep analysis of VSN BA tuning using volumetric GCaMP6f/s Ca2+ imaging. These experiments revealed multiple populations of BA-receptive VSNs with submicromolar sensitivities. We then developed a new physiology-forward approach for identifying AOS ligand-receptor interactions, which we call Fluorescence Live Imaging for Cell Capture and RNA sequencing, or FLICCR-seq. FLICCR-seq analysis revealed five specific V1R family receptors enriched in BA-sensitive VSNs.

Bangladesh is also one of the impacted countries, which needs to conduct sufficient tests to identify patients and accordingly adopt measures to limit the massive outbreak of this viral infection. But due to economic drawbacks and also unavailability of testing equipment, Bangladesh is lagging critically behind in test numbers. This study shows a pool testing method named Conditional Cluster Sampling (CCS) that utilizes soft computing and data analysis techniques to reduce the expense of total testing equipment. The proposed method also demonstrates its effectiveness compared to the traditional individual testing method. Firstly, according to patients' symptoms and severity of their conditions, they are classified into four classes- Minor, Moderate, Major, Critical. After that Random Forest Classifier (RFC) is used to predict the class. Then random sampling is done from each class according to CCS. Finally, using Monte Carlo Simulation (MCS) for 100 cycles, the effectiveness of CCS is demonstrated for different probability levels of infection. It is shown that the CCS method can save up to 22% of the test kits that can save a huge amount of money as well as testing time.","Zoha, Naurin; Ghosh, Sourav Kumar; Arif-Ul-Islam, Mohammad; Ghosh, Tusher",Inform Med Unlocked,,344

321725,XLVets practitioners provide online extramural studies during Covid-19,2020,"Agri-food supply chains in North America have become remarkably efficient, supplying an unprecedented variety of items at the lowest possible cost. However, the initial stages of the COVID-19 pandemic and the near-total temporary loss of the foodservice distribution channel, exposed a vulnerability that many found surprising. Instead of continued shortages, however, the agri-food sector has since moved back to near normal conditions with prices and production levels similar to those typically observed in years prior to the pandemic. Ironically, the specialization in most food supply chains designed for ""just-in-time"" delivery to specific customers with no reserve capacity, which led to the initial disruptions, may have also been responsible for its rapid rebound. A common theme in assessing the impacts across the six commodities examined is the growing importance of understanding the whole supply chain. Over the longer term, a continuation of the pandemic could push the supply chain toward greater consolidation of firms and diversification of products given the increasing option value of maintaining flexibility. Other structural changes will be felt through input markets, most notably labour, as the trend toward greater automation will continue to accelerate as a response to meeting concerns about a consistent supply of healthy and productive workers. The economic fall out from the pandemic may lead to greater concentration in the sector as some firms are not able to survive the downturn and changes in consumer food buying behaviour, including movement toward online shopping and enhanced demand for attributes associated with resiliency, such as local. On the other hand, online shopping may provide opportunities for small producers and processors to shorten supply chains and reach customers directly. In the long term, COVID-19 impacts on global commerce and developing country production are more uncertain and could influence poverty reduction. While COVID-19's impacts on North American agriculture should have minimal effect on the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) through food prices, the ongoing global trends in trade and agribusiness accelerated by the pandemic are relevant for achievement of the SDGs.","Weersink, Alfons; von Massow, Mike; Bannon, Nicholas; Ifft, Jennifer; Maples, Josh; McEwen, Ken; McKendree, Melissa; Nicholson, Charles; Novakovic, Andrew; Rangarajan, Anusuya; Richards, Tim; Rickard, Brad; Rude, James; Schipanski, Meagan; Schnitkey, Gary; Schulz, Lee; Schuurman, Daniel; Schwartzkopf-Genswein, Karen; Stephenson, Mark; Thompson, Jada; Wood, Katie",Agric Syst,,344

322154,Introduction to ‘Reclaiming democracy from below: from the contemporary state capitalist system to peoples’ sovereignty’,2020,"The 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic (SARS-CoV-2; severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) has dramatic consequences on populations in terms of morbidity and mortality and in social terms, the general confinement of almost half of the world's population being a situation unprecedented in history, which is difficult today to measure the impact at the individual and collective levels. More specifically, it affects people with various risk factors, which are more frequent in patients suffering from psychiatric disorders. Psychiatrists need to know: (i) how to identify, the risks associated with the prescription of psychotropic drugs and which can prove to be counterproductive in their association with COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019), (ii) how to assess in terms of benefit/risk ratio, the implication of any hasty and brutal modification on psychotropic drugs that can induce confusion for a differential diagnosis with the evolution of COVID-19. We carried out a review of the literature aimed at assessing the specific benefit/risk ratio of psychotropic treatments in patients suffering from COVID-19. Clinically, symptoms suggestive of COVID-19 (fever, cough, dyspnea, digestive signs) can be caused by various psychotropic drugs and require vigilance to avoid false negatives and false positives. In infected patients, psychotropic drugs should be used with caution, especially in the elderly, considering the pulmonary risk. Lithium and Clozapine, which are the reference drugs in bipolar disorder and resistant schizophrenia, warrant specific attention. For these two treatments the possibility of a reduction in the dosage - in case of minimal infectious signs and in a situation, which does not allow rapid control - should ideally be considered taking into account the clinical response (even biological; plasma concentrations) observed in the face of previous dose reductions. Tobacco is well identified for its effects as an inducer of CYP1A2 enzyme. In a COVID+ patient, the consequences of an abrupt cessation of smoking, particularly related with the appearance of respiratory symptoms (cough, dyspnea), must therefore be anticipated for patients receiving psychotropics metabolized by CYP1A2. Plasma concentrations of these drugs are expected to decrease and can be related to an increase risk of relapse. The symptomatic treatments used in COVID-19 have frequent interactions with the most used psychotropics. If there is no curative treatment for infection to SARS-CoV-2, the interactions of the various molecules currently tested with several classes of psychotropic drugs (antidepressants, antipsychotics) are important to consider because of the risk of changes in cardiac conduction. Specific knowledge on COVID-19 remains poor today, but we must recommend rigor in this context in the use of psychotropic drugs, to avoid adding, in patients suffering from psychiatric disorders, potentially vulnerable in the epidemic context, an iatrogenic risk or loss of efficiency.","Javelot, H; Llorca, P-M; Drapier, D; Fakra, E; Hingray, C; Meyer, G; Dizet, S; Egron, A; Straczek, C; Roser, M; Masson, M; Gaillard, R; Fossati, P; Haffen, E",Encephale,,344

These antibodies exhibited comparably potent neutralization against authentic virus by competing with human angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) receptor for RBD binding. While reducing viruses in lungs, pre-exposure intranasal B8-dIgA1 or B8-dIgA2 led to 81-fold more infectious viruses and severer damage in NT than placebo. Virus-bound B8-dIgA1 and B8-dIgA2 could engage CD209 as an alternative receptor for entry into ACE2-negative cells and allowed viral cell-to-cell transmission. Cryo-EM revealed B8 as a class II neutralizing antibody binding trimeric RBDs in 3-up or 2-up/1-down conformation.

323161,COVID-19 needs a big science approach,2020,"BACKGROUND: Resolving the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic requires diagnostic testing to determine which individuals are infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The current gold standard is to perform reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (PCR) on nasopharyngeal samples. Best-in-class assays demonstrate a limit of detection (LoD) of approximately 100 copies of viral RNA per milliliter of transport media. However, LoDs of currently approved assays vary over 10,000-fold. Assays with higher LoDs will miss infected patients. However, the relative clinical sensitivity of these assays remains unknown. METHODS: Here we model the clinical sensitivities of assays based on their LoD. Cycle threshold (Ct) values were obtained from 4700 first-time positive patients using the Abbott RealTime SARS-CoV-2 Emergency Use Authorization test. We derived viral loads from Ct based on PCR principles and empiric analysis. A sliding scale relationship for predicting clinical sensitivity was developed from analysis of viral load distribution relative to assay LoD. RESULTS: Ct values were reliably repeatable over short time testing windows, providing support for use as a tool to estimate viral load. Viral load was found to be relatively evenly distributed across log10 bins of incremental viral load. Based on these data, each 10-fold increase in LoD is expected to lower assay sensitivity by approximately 13%. CONCLUSIONS: The assay LoD meaningfully impacts clinical performance of SARS-CoV-2 tests. The highest LoDs on the market will miss a majority of infected patients. Assays should therefore be benchmarked against a universal standard to allow cross-comparison of SARS-CoV-2 detection methods.","Arnaout, Ramy; Lee, Rose A; Lee, Ghee Rye; Callahan, Cody; Cheng, Annie; Yen, Christina F; Smith, Kenneth P; Arora, Rohit; Kirby, James E",Clin. infect. dis,,344

Twenty-three HCW recovered from mild COVID-19 disease and exhibited a recall response with high levels of SARS-CoV-2-specific functional antibodies and virus-specific T cells after a single vaccination. Specific immune responses were also detected in seronegative HCW after one vaccination, but a second dose was required to reach high levels of functional antibodies and cellular immune responses in all individuals. Vaccination-induced antibodies cross-neutralized the variants B.1.1.7 and B.1.351, but the neutralizing capacity and Fc-mediated functionality against B.1.351 was consistently 2- to 4-fold lower than to the homologous virus. In addition, peripheral blood mononuclear cells were stimulated with peptide pools spanning the mutated S regions of B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 to detect cross-reactivity of SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells with variants. Importantly, we observed no differences in CD4+ T-cell activation in response to variant antigens, indicating that the B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 S proteins do not escape T-cell-mediated immunity elicited by the wild type S protein. In conclusion, this study shows that some variants can partially escape humoral immunity induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection or BNT162b2 vaccination, but S-specific CD4+ T-cell activation is not affected by the mutations in the B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 variants.","Geers, Daryl; Shamier, Marc C; Bogers, Susanne; den Hartog, Gerco; Gommers, Lennert; Nieuwkoop, Nella N; Schmitz, Katharina S; Rijsbergen, Laurine C; van Osch, Jolieke A T; Dijkhuizen, Emma; Smits, Gaby; Comvalius, Anouskha; van Mourik, Djenolan; Caniels, Tom G; van Gils, Marit J; Sanders, Rogier W; Oude Munnink, Bas B; Molenkamp, Richard; de Jager, Herbert J; Haagmans, Bart L; de Swart, Rik L; Koopmans, Marion P G; van Binnendijk, Robert S; de Vries, Rory D; GeurtsvanKessel, Corine H",Sci. immunol,,344

324802,Virtual collaboration in the age of the coronavirus,2020,"Dimethyl cardamonin (DMC) has been isolated from diverse plants, notably from Cleistocalyx operculatus. We have reviewed the pharmacological properties of this natural product which displays anti-inflammatory, anti-hyperglycemic and anti-cancer properties. The pharmacological activities essentially derive from the capacity of DMC to interact with the protein targets HMGB1 and AMPK. Upon binding to HMGB1, DMC inhibits the nucleocytoplasmic transfer of the protein and its extracellular secretion, thereby blocking its alarmin function. DMC also binds to the AMP site of AMPK to activate phospho-AMPK and then to trigger downstream signals leading to the anti-inflammatory and anti-hyperglycemic effects. AMPK activation by DMC reinforces inhibition of HMGB1, to further reduce the release of the alarmin protein, likely contributing to the anticancer effects. The characterization of a tight control of DMC over the AMPK-HMGB1 axis not only helps to explain the known activities of DMC but also suggests opportunities to use this chalcone to treat other pathological conditions such as the acute respiratory distress syndrome (which affects patients with COVID-19). DMC structural analogues are also evoked.","Bailly, Christian; Vergoten, Gérard",Life Sci,,344

Suggested solutions like social distancing and lockdowns in some areas to help contain the spread of the virus may affect special patient populations like those with chronic illnesses who are unable to access healthcare facilities for their routine care and medicines management. Retail pharmacy outlets are the likely facilities for easy access by these patients. The contribution of community pharmacists in these facilities to manage chronic conditions and promote medication adherence during this COVID-19 pandemic will be essential in easing the burden on already strained health systems. This paper highlights the pharmaceutical care practices of community pharmacists for patients with chronic diseases during this pandemic. This would provide support for the call by the WHO to maintain essential services during the pandemic, in order to prevent non-COVID disease burden on healthcare systems particularly in low-and middle-income countries.","Kretchy, Irene A; Asiedu-Danso, Michelle; Kretchy, James-Paul",Res. soc. adm. pharm,,344
325041,Impact of Personal Protection Habits on the Spread of Pandemics: Insights from an Agent-Based Model,2021,"With the COVID-19 pandemic, the evolutionary fate of SARS-CoV-2 becomes a matter of utmost concern. Mutation D614G in the spike (S) protein has become dominant, and recent evidence suggests it yields a more stable phenotype with higher transmission efficacy. We carry out a structural analysis that provides mechanistic clues on the enhanced infectivity. The D614G substitution creates a sticky packing defect in subunit S1, promoting its association with subunit S2 as a means to stabilize the structure of S1 within the S1/S2 complex. The results raise the therapeutic possibility of immunologically targeting the epitope involved in stabilizing the G614 phenotype as a means of reducing the infection efficacy of SARS-CoV-2. This therapeutic modality would not a-priori interfere directly with current efforts toward the immunological targeting of the RBD epitope; hence, it could be exploited as a complementary treatment.","Fernandez, Ariel",ACS Med.

325701,A spatial data model for urban spatial-temporal accessibility analysis,2020,"Worldwide, millions of children have missed out on early childhood education and care (ECEC) due to the closure of their settings during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, little is known about the socio-emotional impact of these closures on young children. This paper draws upon a study of 506 parents of children aged 1-10 years in Ireland who completed the online Play and Learning in the Early Years (PLEY) Survey during lockdown in May and June 2020. Parents responded to a series of questions about their child's play, learning and development during lockdown, and described the impact of the restrictions on their children's lives. The study was approved by the institutional ethics committee. Findings indicate that most children missed their friends, playing with other children, and the routine and structure of ECEC and school settings. Parents described the negative impact of the closure of these settings on their children's social and emotional well-being, which they suggested, resulted in tantrums, anxiety, clinginess, boredom, and under-stimulation. However, some parents did report positive aspects of lockdown for their children and the family, including more time to play with siblings and a break from the usual routine. While the findings of the PLEY study indicate that children's socio-emotional development was severely disrupted during lockdown, with a variety of negative impacts, this experience was not universal. Moreover, the findings suggest that families missed the nurturing environment provided by ECEC programs that supported their children's socio-emotional development, as well as the structure and routine afforded by their children's participation in early childhood programs.","Egan, Suzanne M; Pope, Jennifer; Moloney, Mary; Hoyne, Clara; Beatty, Chloé",Early Child Educ J,,344

METHOD: Participants included women from the United States (n = 438; age: M = 31.3, SD = 12.71) who completed measures examining their use of video chatting services, self-objectification, video chatting appearance comparison, and appearance satisfaction. RESULTS: The total time spent on video chatting services was not associated with appearance satisfaction; however, self-objectification moderated the relationship between total hours of video chatting and appearance satisfaction. In addition, participants who engaged in more video chatting appearance comparisons reported lower face and body satisfaction. Furthermore, video chatting appearance comparison was associated with more frequent usage of certain Zoom features, such as the ""touch up my appearance"" feature, and more time spent looking at oneself on video calls. Finally, those who spent more time engaged with their families over video chatting services reported greater face and body satisfaction. DISCUSSION: The results of the current study demonstrate that time spent video chatting is not predictive of appearance satisfaction, but that self-objectification can exacerbate these associations.","Pfund, Gabrielle N; Hill, Patrick L; Harriger, Jennifer",Int J Eat Disord,,344

METHODS: A qualitative study using phenomenological analysis. Eight individuals participated in semi-structured interviews that focused on their experiences of decreasing PA as a result of physical distancing measures, and why they sought PA coaching to overcome these issues. Responses were analysed thematically. RESULTS: The participants reported markedly decreasing their PA following the enactment of physical distancing measures. The inability to subsequently engage in regular PA was a source of frustration for participants. Interview analysis revealed two themes that contributed to the understanding of why these individuals felt they needed PA coaching to increase PA; namely, a desire for both listening support and PA self-regulation support. CONCLUSION: The individuals who decreased PA due to COVID-19 desired an autonomy-supportive counselling style, centred on listening support and self-regulatory support. Online PA interventions were not highlighted as strategies to overcome PA barriers. Implications for public health: The effect of physical distancing measures on the determinants of overall PA is important, particularly if prolonged physical distancing is required.","Barrett, Stephen; Rodda, Kane; Begg, Stephen; O039,; Halloran, Paul D; Kingsley, Michael I",Aust N Z J Public Health,,344

The zeta potential values of complexes changed from negative to positive with the increase of pea protein as a result of positively charged complexes formation. The increase in the ratio of pea protein/hydrolysates also resulted in increased turbidity in all samples. Particle size measurements indicated that the complexes tended to form larger aggregates (ranged from 61.5 ± 1.7 µm to 183 ± 2.8 µm). The 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical scavenging activity of the pea protein/fish protein hydrolysate complexes was higher than that of the protein hydrolysates alone. Moreover, increasing levels of pea protein did not affect the antioxidant activity of fish protein hydrolysates. The complexes of the Paralonchurus brasiliensis were chosen for the microencapsulation process by spray-drying. The results revealed that spray-drying did not have a significant effect (P > 0.05) on the protein hydrolysate antioxidant activity when they were complexed with pea protein. Thus, this work suggests that the complexation with pea protein and subsequent microencapsulation by spray-drying is an efficient way to protect the biological activity of protein hydrolysates obtained from bycatch. This study provides evidence for the potential use of bycatch from shrimp fisheries as functional ingredients or nutraceuticals.","Camargo, Tavani Rocha; Khelissa, Simon; Chihib, Nour Eddine; Dumas, Emilie; Wang, Jian; Valenti, Wagner C; Gharsallaoui, Adem",Mar. biotechnol.

Strategies involving the isolation of close contacts can lead to high levels of absences, negatively impacting pupils. MethodsWe fit a stochastic individual-based model of secondary schools to both community swab testing data and secondary school absences data. By simulating epidemics in secondary schools from 31st August 2020 until 21st May 2021, we quantify within-school transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in secondary schools in England, the impact of twice weekly mass testing on within-school transmission, and the potential impact of alternative strategies to the isolation of close contacts in reducing pupil absences. FindingsThe within-school reproduction number, Rschool, has remained below 1 from 31st August 2020 until 21st May 2021. Twice weekly mass testing using LFTs have helped to control within-school transmission in secondary schools in England. A strategy of serial contact testing alongside mass testing substantially reduces absences compared to strategies involving isolating close contacts, with only a marginal increase in within-school transmission. InterpretationSecondary school control strategies involving mass testing have the potential to control within-school transmission while substantially reducing absences compared to an isolation of close contacts policy.","Leng, Trystan; Hill, Edward M; Holmes, Alex; Southall, Emma; Thompson, Robin N; Tildesley, Michael J; Keeling, Matt J; Dyson, Louise",,,344

These data, most of which are recorded within 24 hours of the visit, might be an early indicator of changing patterns in disparities. Using ED visit data from 13 states obtained from the National Syndromic Surveillance Program (NSSP), CDC assessed the number of ED visits with a COVID-19 discharge diagnosis code per 100,000 population during October-December 2020 by age and race/ethnicity. Among 5,794,050 total ED visits during this period, 282,220 (4.9%) were for COVID-19. Racial/ethnic disparities in COVID-19 ED visit rates were observed across age groups.

333498,Learning Epidemiology by Doing: The Empirical Implications of a Spatial-SIR Model with Behavioral Responses,2021-02-19,"SARS-CoV-2-neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) protect against COVID-19. A concern regarding SARS-CoV-2 antibodies is whether they mediate disease enhancement. Here, we isolated NAbs against the receptor-binding domain (RBD) or the N-terminal domain (NTD) of SARS-CoV-2 spike from individuals with acute or convalescent SARS-CoV-2 or a history of SARS-CoV infection. Cryo-electron microscopy of RBD and NTD antibodies demonstrated function-specific modes of binding. Select RBD NAbs also demonstrated Fc receptor-Î³ (FcÎ³R)-mediated enhancement of virus infection in vitro, while five non-neutralizing NTD antibodies mediated FcÎ³R-independent in vitro infection enhancement. However, both types of infection-enhancing antibodies protected from SARS-CoV-2 replication in monkeys and mice. Three of 46 monkeys infused with enhancing antibodies had higher lung inflammation scores compared to controls. One monkey had alveolar edema and elevated bronchoalveolar lavage inflammatory cytokines. Thus, while in vitro antibody-enhanced infection does not necessarily herald enhanced infection in vivo, increased lung inflammation can rarely occur in SARS-CoV-2 antibody-infused macaques.","Li, Dapeng; Edwards, Robert J; Manne, Kartik; Martinez, David R; Schäfer, Alexandra; Alam, S Munir; Wiehe, Kevin; Lu, Xiaozhi; Parks, Robert; Sutherland, Laura L; Oguin, Thomas H; McDanal, Charlene; Perez, Lautaro G; Mansouri, Katayoun; Gobeil, Sophie M C; Janowska, Katarzyna; Stalls, Victoria; Kopp, Megan; Cai, Fangping; Lee, Esther; Foulger, Andrew; Hernandez, Giovanna E; Sanzone, Aja; Tilahun, Kedamawit; Jiang, Chuancang; Tse, Longping V; Bock, Kevin W; Minai, Mahnaz; Nagata, Bianca M; Cronin, Kenneth; Gee-Lai, Victoria; Deyton, Margaret; Barr, Maggie; Von Holle, Tarra; Macintyre, Andrew N; Stover, Erica; Feldman, Jared; Hauser, Blake M; Caradonna, Timothy M; Scobey, Trevor D; Rountree, Wes; Wang, Yunfei; Moody, M Anthony; Cain, Derek W; DeMarco, C Todd; Denny, Thomas N; Woods, Christopher W; Petzold, Elizabeth W; Schmidt, Aaron G; Teng, I-Ting",Cell,,344
334193,Rethinking early years: how the neoliberal agenda fails children,2020,"STUDY DESIGN: A retrospective study of thirteen patients undergoing 5-level anterior spinal surgery for cervical myelopathy. OBJECTIVE: While limited literature exists in reviewing the treatment of high cervical pathology extending caudally, we believe long segment surgery beginning at C2-3 can be accomplished with good success and is an option more patients may benefit from. We aim to describe the technique in accessing the C2-C3 disk space and efficacy of treating multilevel disease beginning at the C2 vertebral body. This includes an extensive technical report and surgical pearls. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Compression at the level of C2 can be daunting to access because of steep approach required. Few studies have described the technique in reaching the C2 level, with less information describing the efficacy of a 5-level anterior fusion starting at C2. METHODS: Patients who underwent surgery between 2000 and 2016 were identified utilizing the department billing database and ICD codes. Patients age, operative indications, levels treated, length of hospital stay, fusion outcome, and operative complications were explored. Independent analysis of fusion was performed. RESULTS: The average length of hospital stay was 3.9 days. Eight patients reported significant improvement of hand weakness, numbness, and/or gait at 6 months follow-up. The most frequent complication was dysphagia (23%). One patient experienced recurrent symptoms secondary to nonunion, and another patient suffered a postoperative neurological worsening because of anterior spinal artery syndrome. CONCLUSION: This retrospective review discusses the technique to visualize and fully decompress C2-C3 spinal segments. In addition, we explored the efficacy and perioperative risk in long segment anterior cervical discectomy and fusion.","Spurgas, Morgan P; Entezami, Pouya; Thomas, James; DiRisio, Darryl J",Clin. spine surg.

While several approaches have been proposed to tackle the problem from an algorithmic perspective, so to reduce the need for annotated data, less attention has been paid to the quality of these data. Following a trend that has emerged recently, we focus on the level of agreement among annotators while selecting data to create offensive language datasets, a task involving a high level of subjectivity. Our study comprises the creation of three novel datasets of English tweets covering different topics and having five crowd-sourced judgments each. We also present an extensive set of experiments showing that selecting training and test data according to different levels of annotators' agreement has a strong effect on classifiers performance and robustness. Our findings are further validated in cross-domain experiments and studied using a popular benchmark dataset. We show that such hard cases, where low agreement is present, are not necessarily due to poor-quality annotation and we advocate for a higher presence of ambiguous cases in future datasets, particularly in test sets, to better account for the different points of view expressed online.","Leonardelli, Elisa; Menini, Stefano; Aprosio, Alessio Palmero; Guerini, Marco; Tonelli, Sara",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2109.13563v1.pdf,344

Prescribing extended thromboprophylaxis for up to 45 days following an acute hospitalization in key patient subgroups that include more than one-quarter of hospitalized medically-ill patients represents a paradigm shift in the way hospital-based physicians think about VTE prevention. Advances in the field of primary thromboprophylaxis in acutely-ill medical patients using validated VTE and bleeding risk assessment models have established key patient subgroups at high risk of VTE and low risk of bleeding that may benefit from both in-hospital and extended thromboprophylaxis. The direct oral anticoagulants betrixaban and rivaroxaban are now U.S. Food and Drug Administration-approved for in-hospital and extended thromboprophylaxis in medically ill patients and provide net clinical benefit in these key subgroups. Coronavirus disease-2019 may predispose patients to VTE due to excessive inflammation, platelet activation, endothelial dysfunction, and hemostasis. The optimum preventive strategy for these patients requires further investigation.

Measurements of plasma parameters were performed for both configurations using argon and helium as working gases. As a result, differences were found in discharge power ($P_{plasma}$), rotational and vibrational temperatures ($T_r$ and $T_v$, respectively) when switching from one configuration to the other. It has been observed that despite the remarkable increase in $P_{plasma}$ when changing from the double barrier configuration to the single barrier one, the values obtained for $T_r$ and $T_v$ also increased, but not in the same proportion as the increase in $P_{plasma}$, which suggests a non-linear dependency between temperature and discharge power s in the plasma jet.

We sought to characterise patients discharged following a COVID-19 hospitalisation within a large integrated health system in the United States. METHODS: We performed a retrospective study of 2180 COVID-19 patients discharged between 1 April 2020 and 31 July 2020. The primary endpoint was all-cause observation stay or inpatient readmission within 30 days from discharge. Bivariate and multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed to estimate the association between key socio-demographic and clinical characteristics with risk of 30-day readmission. RESULTS: The 30-day readmission rate was 7.6% (n = 166); 30-day mortality rate was 1% (n = 19). Most readmissions were respiratory-related (58%) and occurred at a median time of 5 days post discharge. Adjusted models showed that prior hospitalisations (Odds Ratio = 2.36, [95% Confidence Interval: 1.59-3.50]), chronic pulmonary disease (1.57 [1.09-2.28]), and discharge to home health (1.46 [1.01-2.11]) were significantly associated with 30-day readmission. Longer duration from diagnosis to index admission was borderline associated with lower odds of readmission (0.95 [0.91-1.00]). CONCLUSION: Readmission and mortality rates for COVID-19 following discharge are low. Most readmissions occur early and are due to respiratory causes and may reflect the prolonged acute disease course.","Huang, Cheng-Wei; Desai, Prashant P; Wei, Kenneth K; Liu, In-Lu Amy; Lee, Janet S; Nguyen, Huong Q",Infect Dis (Lond),,344

Primary care can play a key role in early detection and contention of the disease. There is lack of information on the clinical profile of suspected Covid-19 primary care patients and controversy on the effectiveness of rapid serologic tests in the diagnosis and surveillance of the disease. AIM: To assess the effectiveness of rapid serologic testing in detection and surveillance of Covid-19 cases in primary care. DESIGN AND SETTING: Longitudinal study based on non-random sample of 522 participants including 304 symptomatic patients and 218 high-risk asymptomatic individuals receiving care at four primary health clinics in an underserved area in Santiago. METHOD: Participants were systematically assessed and tested for Covid-19 with RT-PCR and serology at baseline and followed clinically and serologically for a three weeks period. RESULTS: The prevalence rate of RT-PCR confirmed Covid-19 cases was 3.5 times higher in symptomatic patients (27.5% (22.1-32.8; 95% CI) compared to asymptomatic participants (7.9% (4.3-11.6; 95% CI). Similarly, the immune response was significantly different between both groups. Sensitivity of serologic testing was 57.8% (44.8-70.1; 95% CI) during the third week of follow-up and specificity was 98.4% (95.5-99.7; 95% CI). CONCLUSION: Rapid serologic testing is ineffective for detecting asymptomatic or non-severe cases of COVID-19 at early stages of the disease but can be of value for surveillance of immunity response in primary care. The clinical profile and immune response of Covid-19 patients in primary care differ from those in hospital-based populations.","Puschel, Klaus; Ferreccio, Catterina; Peñaloza, Blanca; Abarca, Katia; Rojas, Maria-Paulina; Tellez, Alvaro; Moore, Philippa; Cea, Ana Maria; Wilson, Carlos; Cid, Vicente; Montero, Joaquin",,,344

It is currently unclear whether uncontrolled hypertension is a risk factor for contracting Covid-19, but controlling blood pressure is still considered important to reduce the burden of disease. SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19, binds to ACE2 in the lungs to enter cells, resulting in the use of angiotensin converting enzymes (ACE inhibitors) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), 2 classes of drugs that are frequently used in controlling hypertension, questionable benefi t or harm. Objective: Studying patients with covid 19 and their accompanying comorbids who were treated at the Hospital of the Faculty of Medicine of the Indonesian Christian University, Jakarta. Method:This type of research is observational research. This study only observed patients. Study design of all treated patients with COVID-19. Research Location: General Hospital of the Christian University of Indonesia, Research Time: May to October 2020. Result:It showed 50 people entered the inclusion criteria, hypertension with the most covid 19, 26 people (52%), type 2 diabetes mellitus with covid 19, 22 people (44%), CKD on hemodialysis with covid 19, 4 people (8%), CKD Non HD with covid 19, 3 people (6%). There were 2 patients with heart failure with covid 19 (4%), 2 people with hyperthyroidism with covid 19 (4%). Meanwhile, the ages of 61-70 years (40%) have a lot of Covid 19 in the period that date. Conclusion:Covid 19 patients with comorbid hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus were mostly found with ages between 61-70 years.","Suling, F. R. W.; Raspati, Z. A.; Rantung, N. O.

METHODS: The clinical characteristics, end-of-life care and resuscitation status of Muslim patients who died in the ICU of our tertiary care hospital in year 2020 from COVID were compared to Non-COVID patients. RESULTS: There were 32 patients in COVID and 64 in the Non-COVID group. A major proportion, mainly of Non-COVID patients, already had a hospice eligible terminal disease at baseline (p=.002). COVID patients were admitted to the ICU sooner after hospitalization (2.2 vs. 17 days), had prolonged duration of mechanical ventilation (18.5 vs. 6 days) and longer ICU stay (24 vs. 8 days) than non-COVID patients, respectively (p<.001). Almost all patients were ""Full Code"" initially. However, status was eventually changed to 'do-not-attempt resuscitation' (DNAR) in about 60% of the cohort. COVID patients were made DNAR late in their ICU stay, predominantly in the last 24 hours of life (p=.04). Until the very end, patients in both groups were on tube feeds, underwent blood draws and imaging, required high dose vasopressors, with few limitations or withdrawal of therapies. Family members were usually not present at bedside at time of death. There was minimal involvement of chaplain and palliative care services. CONCLUSIONS: Muslim COVID-19 patients had prolonged mechanical ventilation and ICU stay and a delayed decision to DNAR status than non-COVID Muslim patients. Limitation or withdrawal of therapy occurred infrequently. The utilization of chaplain and palliative care service needs improvement.","Khalid, Imran; Imran, Maryam; Yamani, Romaysaa M; Imran, Manahil; Akhtar, Muhammad Ali; Khalid, Tabindeh Jabeen",Am J Hosp Palliat Care,,344

345804,Digitalizzazione e patrimonio culturale tra crisi e opportunità: L’esperienza del museo egizio di torino,2020,"BACKGROUND: The growing incidence of coronavirus (COVID-19) continues to cause fear, anxiety, and panic amongst the community, especially for healthcare providers (HCPs), as the most vulnerable group at risk of contracting this new SARS-CoV-2 infection. To protect and enhance the ability of HCPs to perform their role in responding to COVID-19, healthcare authorities must help to alleviate the level of stress and anxiety amongst HCPs and the community. This will improve the knowledge, attitude and practice towards COVID-19, especially for HCPs. In addition, authorities need to comply in treating this virus by implementing control measures and other precautions. This study explores the knowledge, attitude, anxiety, and preventive behaviours among Yemeni HCPs towards COVID-19. METHODS: A descriptive, web-based-cross-sectional study was conducted among 1231 Yemeni HCPs. The COVID-19 related questionnaire was designed using Google forms where the responses were coded and analysed using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences software package (IBM SPSS), version 22.0. Descriptive statistics and Pearson's correlation coefficient test were also employed in this study. A p-value of < 0.05 with a 95% confidence interval was considered as statistically significant. The data collection phase commenced on 22nd April 2020, at 6 pm and finished on 26th April 2020 at 11 am. RESULTS: The results indicated that from the 1231 HCPs participating in this study, 61.6% were male, and 67% were aged between 20 and 30 years with a mean age of 29.29 ± 6.75. Most (86%) held a bachelor's degree or above having at least 10 years of work experience or less (88.1%). However, while 57.1% of the respondents obtained their information via social networks and news media, a further 60.0% had never attended lectures/discussions about COVID-19. The results further revealed that the majority of respondents had adequate knowledge, optimistic attitude, moderate level of anxiety, and high-performance in preventive behaviours, 69.8, 85.10%, 51.0 and 87.70%, respectively, towards COVID-19. CONCLUSION: Although the Yemeni HCPs exhibited an adequate level of knowledge, optimistic attitude, moderate level of anxiety, and high-performance in preventive behaviours toward COVID-19, the results highlighted gaps, particularly in their knowledge and attitude towards COVID-19.","Alrubaiee, Gamil Ghaleb; Al-Qalah, Talal Ali Hussein; Al-Aawar, Mohammed Sadeg A",BMC Public Health,,344

Here we assess these genetic alterations for the first time in a cohort from North of Morocco. METHODS: Thirty-three patients diagnosed with breast cancer at the age of &#8804;40 years were recruited irrespective of breast and/or ovarian cancer family history. Coding regions and intron-exon boundaries of BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes were sequenced from peripheral blood DNA using Ion Proton (Thermo Fisher Scientific) next generation sequencing platform. RESULTS: Overall, five BRCA germline mutations were identified (15.1%). The frequency of mutations among patients with family history of breast cancer was 16.7%. Three mutations were found in BRCA1 (9%) and two within the BRCA2 gene (6%). These are three frameshift mutations (c.798_799del, c.2125_2126insA, c.5116_5119delAATA), one missense (c.116G > A) and one nonsense mutation (c.289G > T). The mutation c.5116_5119delAATA has a founder effect in North Africa. Moreover, one variant of unknown significance was identified in BRCA2 (c.4090A > G). Most BRCA mutations carriers (80%) had no family history of breast cancer. CONCLUSION: Our data do not support the hypothesis that BRCA mutations alone explain the higher frequency of breast cancer in Moroccan young women. The young age (&#8804;40 years) for breast cancer diagnosis seems to be strongly predictive of BRCA mutation status in Moroccan patients. These results will help in decision making with regard to genetic counseling and testing in the national scale.","Bakkach, Joaira; Mansouri, Mohamed; Derkaoui, Touria; Loudiyi, Ali; El Fahime, ElMostafa; Barakat, Amina; Ghailani Nourouti, Naima; Martinez De Villarreal, Jaime; Cortijo Bringas, Carlos; Bennani Mechita, Mohcine",BMC Cancer,,344

350149,The Potential of Artificial Intelligence to Analyze Chest Radiographs for Signs of COVID-19 Pneumonia,2020,"Background: New-onset diabetes after transplantation (NODAT) is a serious complication following liver transplantation (LT). The present study aimed to investigate the incidence of and risk factors for NODAT using the Korean Organ Transplantation Registry (KOTRY) database. Methods: Patients with history of pediatric transplantation (age &#8804;18 years), re-transplantation, multi-organ transplantation, or pre-existing diabetes mellitus were excluded. A total of 1,919 non-diabetic adult patients who underwent a primary LT between May 2014 and December 2017 were included. Risk factors were identified using Cox regression analysis. Results: NODAT occurred in 19.7% (n=377) of adult liver transplant recipients. Multivariate analysis showed steroid use, increased age, and high body mass index (BMI) in recipients, and implantation of a left-side liver graft was closely associated with NODAT in adult LT. In living donor liver transplant (LDLT) patients (n=1,473), open donor hepatectomy in the living donors, steroid use, small for size liver graft (graft to recipient weight ratio &#8804;0.8), increased age, and high BMI in the recipient were predictive factors for NODAT. The use of antimetabolite and basiliximab induction reduced the incidence of NODAT in adult LT and in adult LDLT. Conclusions: Basiliximab induction, early steroid withdrawal, and antimetabolite therapy may prevent NODAT after adult LT. High BMI or advanced age in liver recipients, open donor hepatectomy in living donors, and small size liver graft can predict the occurrence of NODAT after adult LT or LDLT.","Man Kim, Jong; Hwang, Shin; Lee, Kwang-Woong; Lee, Jae-Geun; Ryu, Je Ho; Kim, Bong-Wan; Choi, Dong Lak; You, Young Kyoung; Kim, Dong-Sik; Nah, Yang Won; Kang, Koo Jeong; Cho, Jai Young; Hong, Geun; Choi, In Seok; Yu, Hee Chul; Choi, Dongho; Kim, Myoung Soo",Hepatobiliary Surg Nutr,,344

This systematic review aimed to discuss the involvement of the body's systems during COVID-19 infection comprehensively. PubMed database was used to identify relative studies to be included in this review. Four authors searched PubMed independently using determined search terms. Then, the results were merged and duplicates were removed. The inclusion and exclusion criteria were specified and at least two review authors assessed the eligibility of the studies. The full texts of included studies were reviewed in detail by the authors and the relevant content was extracted and summarized. The pulmonary tract is the most frequent system involved with a wide range of involvement from no pneumonia to white lung and acute respiratory distress syndrome. Computed tomography is the best imaging modality to diagnose COVID-19 infection. Cardiac and renal system injuries are seen during COVID-19 infection and must be taken seriously. Gastrointestinal manifestations are frequently observed during the infection and are probably associated with more severe disease. The placenta acts as an important physiological and immunological barrier that prevents transplacental vertical transmission. COVID-19 infection is a multiorgan involving infection which needs a team of different expertise to diagnose and manage the disease. Although there are many studies available about COVID-19 infection, most of them are focused on pulmonary involvement and the effects of the virus on many other organs and systems remain unclear that shows the necessity of further investigations about the disease.

OBJECTIVE: The present study examined the psychological responses toward COVID-19 among university students in three countries (Indonesia, Taiwan, and Thailand). METHODS: Using a cross-sectional online survey, university students from five public universities (two in Indonesia, two in Thailand, one in Taiwan) were recruited via popular social media sites, including Facebook, LINE, broadcast WhatsApp. All the students (938 in Indonesia, 734 in Thailand, 313 in Taiwan) completed questions concerning their anxiety, suicidal thoughts, confidence in COVID-19 pandemic control, risk perception in susceptibility to COVID-19, perceived support, resources for fighting COVID-19, and sources of COVID-19 information. RESULTS: Thai students had the highest levels of anxiety and suicidal thoughts but the lowest levels of confidence in pandemic control and available resources of fighting COVID-19 among the four student groups. Factors associated with higher anxiety and suicidal thoughts differed across countries. Less perceived satisfactory support was associated with more suicidal thoughts among Indonesian and Thai students. Taiwanese students were more negatively affected by information gathered from the internet and from medical staff. CONCLUSIONS: Healthcare providers in Thailand may need to pay special attention to Thai university students given their high levels of anxiety and suicidal thoughts. In addition, healthcare providers should establish a good supporting system for university students as the results of this study indicate a negative association between support and suicidal thoughts.","Pramukti, Iqbal; Strong, Carol; Sitthimongkol, Yajai; Setiawan, Agus; Pandin, Moses Glorino Rumambo; Yen, Cheng-Fang; Lin, Chung-Ying; Griffiths, Mark D; Ko, Nai-Ying",J. med. internet res,,344

The lack of current evidence to formulate specific recommendations and assess sodium status is reflected in a variability of recommendations in international guidelines. This narrative review presents an overview of the current evidence. Infants with CF in particular are at risk for severe sodium deficiency, potentially leading to metabolic alkalosis due to low intake and high sweat losses.

Pandemic containment and confinement measures impact societies and economies; their costs and benefits must be assessed holistically. This study provides an evolving portrait of the health, economic and social consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic on vulnerable populations in India. Our analysis focuses on 100 days early in the pandemic from 13 March to 20 June 2020. We developed a conceptual framework based on the human right to health and the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). We analysed people's experiences recorded and shared via mobile phone on the voice platforms operated by the Gram Vaani COVID-19 response network, a service for rural and low-income populations now being deployed to support India's COVID-19 response. Quantitative and visual methods were used to summarize key features of the data and explore relationships between factors. In its first 100 days, the platform logged over 1.15 million phone calls, of which 793 350 (69%) were outbound calls related largely to health promotion in the context of COVID-19. Analysis of 6636 audio recordings by network users revealed struggles to secure the basic necessities of survival, including food (48%), cash (17%), transportation (10%) and employment or livelihoods (8%). Themes were mapped to shortfalls in 10 SDGs and their associated targets. Pre-existing development deficits and weak social safety nets are driving vulnerability during the COVID-19 crisis. For an effective pandemic response and recovery, these must be addressed through inclusive policy design and institutional reforms.","Johri, Mira; Agarwal, Sumeet; Khullar, Aman; Chandra, Dinesh; Pratap, Vijay Sai; Seth, Aaditeshwar",Health promot. internation,,344

The models that guide the management of these fisheries almost always assume reproduction is proportional to mass (isometry), when fecundity generally increases disproportionately to mass (hyperallometry). Judged against several management reference points, we show that assuming isometry overestimates the replenishment potential of exploited fish stocks by 22% (range: 2% to 78%) for 32 of the world's largest fisheries, risking systematic overharvesting. We calculate that target catches based on assumptions of isometry are more than double those based on assumptions of hyperallometry for most species, such that common reference points are set twice as high as they should be to maintain the target level of replenishment. We also show that hyperallometric reproduction provides opportunities for increasing the efficacy of tools that are underused in standard fisheries management, such as protected areas or harvest slot limits. Adopting management strategies that conserve large, hyperfecund fish may, in some instances, result in higher yields relative to traditional approaches. We recommend that future assessment of reference points and quotas include reproductive hyperallometry unless there is clear evidence that it does not occur in that species.","Marshall, Dustin J; Bode, Michael; Mangel, Marc; Arlinghaus, Robert; Dick, E J",Proc.

354121,Experts protest Trump's withdrawal from WHO,2020,"Previous studies have showed clinical characteristics of patients with the 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) and the evidence of person-to-person transmission. Limited data are available for asymptomatic infections. This study aims to present the clinical characteristics of 24 cases with asymptomatic infection screened from close contacts and to show the transmission potential of asymptomatic COVID-19 virus carriers. Epidemiological investigations were conducted among all close contacts of COVID-19 patients (or suspected patients) in Nanjing, Jiangsu Province, China, from Jan 28 to Feb 9, 2020, both in clinic and in community. Asymptomatic carriers were laboratory-confirmed positive for the COVID-19 virus by testing the nucleic acid of the pharyngeal swab samples. Their clinical records, laboratory assessments, and chest CT scans were reviewed. As a result, none of the 24 asymptomatic cases presented any obvious symptoms while nucleic acid screening. Five cases (20.8%) developed symptoms (fever, cough, fatigue, etc.) during hospitalization. Twelve (50.0%) cases showed typical CT images of ground-glass chest and 5 (20.8%) presented stripe shadowing in the lungs. The remaining 7 (29.2%) cases showed normal CT image and had no symptoms during hospitalization. These 7 cases were younger (median age: 14.0 years; P=0.012) than the rest. None of the 24 cases developed severe COVID-19 pneumonia or died. The median communicable period, defined as the interval from the first day of positive nucleic acid tests to the first day of continuous negative tests, was 9.5 days (up to 21 days among the 24 asymptomatic cases). Through epidemiological investigation, we observed a typical asymptomatic transmission to the cohabiting family members, which even caused severe COVID-19 pneumonia. Overall, the asymptomatic carriers identified from close contacts were prone to be mildly ill during hospitalization. However, the communicable period could be up to three weeks and the communicated patients could develop severe illness. These results highlighted the importance of close contact tracing and longitudinally surveillance via virus nucleic acid tests. Further isolation recommendation and continuous nucleic acid tests may also be recommended to the patients discharged.","Hu, Zhiliang; Song, Ci; Xu, Chuanjun; Jin, Guangfu; Chen, Yaling; Xu, Xin; Ma, Hongxia; Chen, Wei; Lin, Yuan; Zheng, Yishan; Wang, Jianming; Hu, Zhibin; Yi, Yongxiang; Shen, Hongbing",Sci China Life Sci,,344

This study established prognostic scoring models based on comorbidities and other clinical information for severe and critical patients with COVID-19. Material and Methods: We retrospectively collected data from 51 patients diagnosed as severe or critical COVID-19 who were admitted between January 29, 2020, and February 18, 2020. The Charlson (CCI), Elixhauser (ECI), and age- and smoking-adjusted Charlson (ASCCI) and Elixhauser (ASECI) comorbidity indices were used to evaluate the patient outcomes. Results: The mean hospital length of stay (LOS) of the COVID-19 patients was 22.82 ± 12.32 days; 19 patients (37.3%) were hospitalized for more than 24 days. Multivariate analysis identified older age (OR 1.064, P = 0.018, 95%CI 1.011-1.121) and smoking (OR 3.696, P = 0.080, 95%CI 0.856-15.955) as positive predictors of a long LOS. There were significant trends for increasing hospital LOS with increasing CCI, ASCCI, and ASECI scores (OR 57.500, P = 0.001, 95%CI 5.687-581.399; OR 71.500, P = 0.001, 95%CI 5.689-898.642; and OR 19.556, P = 0.001, 95%CI 3.315-115.372, respectively).

Pour autant, la caractérisation de l’impact de la pandémie est potentiellement biaisée par les méthodes de surveillances basées sur les données de dépistage en laboratoire et sur le nombre d’hospitalisations du fait de possible difficultés d’accès aux soins de cette population. Cette étude de cohorte a pour objectif d’estimer la prévalence et les facteurs associés à l’infection par le SARS-CoV-2 chez les personnes en situation de sans-abrisme. Matériels et méthodes Les personnes adultes vivant à la rue, en squat/bidonville, hébergement d’urgence, hôtel de mise à l’abri ou centre d’hébergement et de réinsertion sociale de la ville de Marseille ont été invitées à participer à l’étude. Un questionnaire et un test rapide sérologique ont été administrés de juin à début août puis de septembre à décembre 2020. Pour chaque période les résultats incidents des PCR à SARS-CoV-2 étaient également rapportés. Une analyse de survie avec courbe de Kaplan–Meier ainsi qu’un modèle de Cox multivarié a été réalisé afin d’évaluer les facteurs associés à l’infection par le SARS-CoV-2. Résultats Au total, 1249 participants ont été inclus. La séroprévalence était de 6,01 % [4,68–7,34] entre juin et août et de 18,86 % [16,00–21,72] entre septembre et décembre (p&lt;0,005). Le fait de vivre dans un centre d’hébergement d’urgence (3,58 [1,08–11,82]) ou un hôtel de mise à l’abri (3,43 [1,04–11,31]) et d’avoir plus de 5 personnes contacts par jour (1,75 [1,23–2,50]) étaient associés dans l’analyse multivariée a un risque plus élevé d’infection. A contrario, la consommation de tabac (0,45 [0,32–0,63]), la difficulté d’accès à des produits d’hygiène (0,64 [0,43–0,96]) et le fait de garder une source de revenue au décours de la crise (0,71 [0,52–0,96]) étaient associées à un risque plus faible. Conclusion Nos résultats confirment l’importance d’adapter les types d’hébergements d’urgence ainsi que la nécessité d’une approche globale auprès des plus vulnérables afin de limiter la diffusion de l’épidémie dans cette population.","Mosnier, E.; Loubière, S.; Monfardini, E.; Alibert, A.; Landier, J.; Ninoves, L.; Bosetti, T.; Mosnier, M.; Nguengang Wakap, S.; Tinland, A.",Infectious Diseases Now,,344

The potential for transmission of this disease has led to an important scarcity of health-care resources. Consequently, alternative solutions have been explored by many physicians and researchers. Non-invasive Ventilation has been revealed as one alternative for patients with associated acute respiratory distress syndrome. This technique is being used in combination with helmet-like interfaces because of their versatility and affordability. However, these interfaces could experience important problems of CO2 rebreathing, especially under low flow rate conditions. This work proposes a Computational Fluid Dynamics method to accurately characterize the fluid flow in a pre-design environment of helmet-like interfaces. Parameters as effective dead space, rebreathing, pressure, or temperature field distribution are quantified and analysed in detail in order to study the performance and feasibility of such devices to relieve the effects of respiratory infections.","Gil, A; Martínez, M; Quintero, P; Medina, A",J Biomech,,344

Characterizing these assays provides scientific basis to best use them. The current study assessed one chemiluminescent assay (Abbott COVID-2 IgG) and two lateral flow assays (STANDARD Q [SQ] IgM/IgG Duo and Wondfo total antibody test) using 113 blood samples from 71 PCR-confirmed COVID-19 hospitalized patients, 119 samples with potential cross-reactions, and 1068 negative controls including 942 pre-pandemic samples. SARS-CoV-2 IgM antibodies became detectable 3-4 days post-symptom onset using SQ IgM test and IgG antibodies were first detected 5-6 days post-onset using SQ IgG. Abbott IgG and Wondfo Total were able to detect antibodies 7 to 8 days post-onset. After 14 days post-symptom onset, the SQ IgG, Abbott IgG and Wondfo Total tests were able to detect antibodies from 100% of the PCR-confirmed patients in this series; 87.5% sensitivity for SQ IgM. Overall agreement was 88.5% between SQ IgM/IgG and Wondfo Total and 94.6% between SQ IgG and Abbott IgG. No cross-reaction due to recent sera with three of the endemic coronaviruses was observed. Viral hepatitis and autoimmune samples were the main source of limited cross-reactions. The specificities were 100% for SQ IgG and Wondfo Total, 99.62% for Abbott IgG, and 98.87% for SQ IgM.

Risk is particularly relevant in relation to endoscopy procedures. This study aimed to describe a contingency plan for a tertiary academic cancer center, define a strategy to prioritize and postpone examinations, and evaluate the infection rate among healthcare workers (HCWs) in the endoscopy unit of the Cancer Institute of the State of São Paulo (ICESP). METHODS: We created a strategy to balance the risk of acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and to mitigate the effects of postponing endoscopic procedures in oncological patients. A retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data on all endoscopies between March and June 2020 compared with those during the same period in 2019 was carried out. All HCWs were interviewed to obtain clinical data and SARS-CoV-2 test results. RESULTS: During the COVID-19 outbreak, there was a reduction of 55% in endoscopy cases in total. Colonoscopy was the most affected modality. The total infection rate among all HCWs was 38%. None of the senior digestive endoscopists had COVID-19. However, all bronchoscopists had been infected. One of three fellows had a serological diagnosis of COVID-19. Two-thirds of all nurses were infected, whereas half of all technicians were infected. CONCLUSIONS: In this pandemic scenario, all endoscopy services must prioritize the procedures that will be performed. It was possible to maintain some endoscopic procedures, including those meant to provide nutritional access, tissue diagnosis, and endoscopic resection. Personal protective equipment (PPE) seems effective in preventing transmission of COVID-19 from patients to digestive endoscopists. These measures can be useful in planning, even for pandemics in the future.","Pombo, Amanda A M; Lenz, Luciano; Paulo, Gustavo A; Santos, Mônica A; Tamae, Patricia K; Santos, Alisson L D R; Rezende, Daniel T; Martins, Bruno; Kawaguti, Fabio S; Pennachi, Caterina M P S; Gusmon-Oliveira, Carla C; Uemura, Ricardo S; Geiger, Sebastian; Lima, Marcelo S; Baba, Elisa R; Figueiredo, Viviane R; Safatle-Ribeiro, Adriana; Maluf-Filho, Fauze; Ribeiro-Júnior, Ulysses",Clinics,,344

363458,The spread of coronavirus across Africa,2020,"The spike (S) polypeptide of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) consists of the S1 and S2 subunits and is processed by cellular proteases at the S1/S2 boundary that contains a furin cleavage site (FCS), 682RRAR&#8595;S686 Various deletions surrounding the FCS have been identified in patients. When SARS-CoV-2 propagated in Vero cells, it acquired deletions surrounding the FCS. We studied the viral transcriptome in Vero cell-derived SARS-CoV-2-infected primary human airway epithelia (HAE) cultured at an air-liquid interface (ALI) with an emphasis on the viral genome stability of the FCS. While we found overall the viral transcriptome is similar to that generated from infected Vero cells, we identified a high percentage of mutated viral genome and transcripts in HAE-ALI. Two highly frequent deletions were found at the FCS region: a 12 amino acid deletion (678TNSPRRAR&#8595;SVAS689) that contains the underlined FCS and a 5 amino acid deletion (675QTQTN679) that is two amino acids upstream of the FCS. Further studies on the dynamics of the FCS deletions in apically released virions from 11 infected HAE-ALI cultures of both healthy and lung disease donors revealed that the selective pressure for the FCS maintains the FCS stably in 9 HAE-ALI cultures but with 2 exceptions, in which the FCS deletions are retained at a high rate of >40% after infection of &#8805;13 days. Our study presents evidence for the role of unique properties of human airway epithelia in the dynamics of the FCS region during infection of human airways, which is likely donor dependent.IMPORTANCE Polarized human airway epithelia at an air-liquid interface (HAE-ALI) are an in vitro model that supports efficient infection of SARS-CoV-2. The spike (S) protein of SARS-CoV-2 contains a furin cleavage site (FCS) at the boundary of the S1 and S2 domains which distinguishes it from SARS-CoV. However, FCS deletion mutants have been identified in patients and in vitro cell cultures, and how the airway epithelial cells maintain the unique FCS remains unknown. We found that HAE-ALI cultures were capable of suppressing two prevalent FCS deletion mutants (&#916;678TNSPRRAR&#8595;SVAS689 and &#916;675QTQTN679) that were selected during propagation in Vero cells. While such suppression was observed in 9 out of 11 of the tested HAE-ALI cultures derived from independent donors, 2 exceptions that retained a high rate of FCS deletions were also found. Our results present evidence of the donor-dependent properties of human airway epithelia in the evolution of the FCS during infection.","Zou, Wei; Xiong, Min; Hao, Siyuan; Zhang, Elizabeth Yan; Baumlin, Nathalie; Kim, Michael D; Salathe, Matthias; Yan, Ziying; Qiu, Jianming",mBio (Online),,344

DESIGN: Living rapid review of observational and experimental studies with random-effects hierarchical Bayesian meta-analyses. Published articles and pre-prints were identified via MEDLINE and medRxiv. SETTING: Community or hospital, no restrictions on location. PARTICIPANTS: Adults who received a SARS-CoV-2 test or a COVID-19 diagnosis. MEASUREMENTS: Outcomes were SARS-CoV-2 infection, hospitalization, disease severity and mortality stratified by smoking status. Study quality was assessed (i.e. 'good', 'fair' and 'poor'). FINDINGS: Version 7 (searches up to 25 August 2020) included 233 studies with 32 'good' and 'fair' quality studies included in meta-analyses. Fifty-seven studies (24.5%) reported current, former and never smoking status. Recorded smoking prevalence among people with COVID-19 was generally lower than national prevalence. Current compared with never smokers were at reduced risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection [relative risk (RR) = 0.74, 95% credible interval (CrI) = 0.58-0.93, &#964; = 0.41]. Data for former smokers were inconclusive (RR = 1.05, 95% CrI = 0.95-1.17, &#964; = 0.17), but favoured there being no important association (21% probability of RR &#8805; 1.1). Former compared with never smokers were at somewhat increased risk of hospitalization (RR = 1.20, CrI = 1.03-1.44, &#964; = 0.17), greater disease severity (RR = 1.52, CrI = 1.13-2.07, &#964; = 0.29) and mortality (RR = 1.39, 95% CrI = 1.09-1.87, &#964; = 0.27). Data for current smokers were inconclusive (RR = 1.06, CrI = 0.82-1.35, &#964; = 0.27; RR = 1.25, CrI = 0.85-1.93, &#964; = 0.34; RR = 1.22, 95% CrI = 0.78-1.94, &#964; = 0.49, respectively), but favoured there being no important associations with hospitalization and mortality (35% and 70% probability of RR &#8805; 1.1, respectively) and a small but important association with disease severity (79% probability of RR &#8805; 1.1). CONCLUSIONS: Compared with never smokers, current smokers appear to be at reduced risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection, while former smokers appear to be at increased risk of hospitalization, increased disease severity and mortality from COVID-19.

365519,Bias in ontologies -- a preliminary assessment,2021-01-20,"Emissions of aviation include CO2, H2O, NOx, sulfur oxides, and soot. Many studies have investigated the annual mean climate impact of aviation emissions. While CO2 has a long atmospheric residence time and is almost uniformly distributed in the atmosphere, non-CO2 gases and particles and their products have short atmospheric residence times and are heterogeneously distributed. The climate impact of non-CO2 aviation emissions is known to vary with different meteorological background situations. The aim of this study is to systematically investigate the influence of characteristic weather situations on aviation climate effects over the North Atlantic region, to identify the most sensitive areas, and to potentially detect systematic weather-related similarities. If aircraft were re-routed to avoid climate-sensitive regions, the overall aviation climate impact might be reduced. Hence, the sensitivity of the atmosphere to local emissions provides a basis for the assessment of weather-related, climate-optimized flight trajectory planning. To determine the climate change contribution of an individual emission as a function of location, time, and weather situation, the radiative impact of local emissions of NOx and H2O to changes in O3, CH4, H2O and contrail cirrus was computed by means of the ECHAM5/MESSy Atmospheric Chemistry model. From this, 4-dimensional climate change functions (CCFs) were derived. Typical weather situations in the North Atlantic region were considered for winter and summer. Weather-related differences in O3, CH4, H2O, and contrail cirrus CCFs were investigated. The following characteristics were identified: enhanced climate impact of contrail cirrus was detected for emissions in areas with large-scale lifting, whereas low climate impact of contrail cirrus was found in the area of the jet stream. Northwards of 60∘ N, contrails usually cause climate warming in winter, independent of the weather situation. NOx emissions cause a high positive climate impact if released in the area of the jet stream or in high-pressure ridges, which induces a south- and downward transport of the emitted species, whereas NOx emissions at, or transported towards, high latitudes cause low or even negative climate impact. Independent of the weather situation, total NOx effects show a minimum at ∼250 hPa, increasing towards higher and lower altitudes, with generally higher positive impact in summer than in winter. H2O emissions induce a high climate impact when released in regions with lower tropopause height, whereas low climate impact occurs for emissions in areas with higher tropopause height. H2O CCFs generally increase with height and are larger in winter than in summer. The CCFs of all individual species can be combined, facilitating the assessment of total climate impact of aircraft trajectories considering CO2 and spatially and temporally varying non-CO2 effects. Furthermore, they allow for the optimization of aircraft trajectories with reduced overall climate impact. This also facilitates a fair evaluation of trade-offs between individual species. In most regions, NOx and contrail cirrus dominate the sensitivity to local aviation emissions. The findings of this study recommend considering weather-related differences for flight trajectory optimization in favour of reducing total climate impact.","Frömming, Christine Grewe Volker Brinkop Sabine Jöckel Patrick Haslerud Amund S.; Rosanka, Simon Jesper van Manen Matthes Sigrun",Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,,344

Conventional technologies have several drawbacks (i.e., cross-infection risk, filtration efficiency improvements limited by difficulty in breathing, and no safe reusability), which have yet to be addressed in a single device. Here, we report the development of a filter overcoming the major technical challenges of respiratory protective devices. Large-pore membranes, offering high breathability but low bacteria capture, were functionalized to have a uniform salt layer on the fibers. The salt-functionalized membranes achieved high filtration efficiency as opposed to the bare membrane, with differences of up to 48%, while maintaining high breathability (> 60% increase compared to commercial surgical masks even for the thickest salt filters tested). The salt-functionalized filters quickly killed Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria aerosols in vitro, with CFU reductions observed as early as within 5 min, and in vivo by causing structural damage due to salt recrystallization. The salt coatings retained the pathogen inactivation capability at harsh environmental conditions (37 °C and a relative humidity of 70%, 80% and 90%). Combination of these properties in one filter will lead to the production of an effective device, comprehensibly mitigating infection transmission globally.","Rubino, Ilaria; Oh, Euna; Han, Sumin; Kaleem, Sana; Hornig, Alex; Lee, Su-Hwa; Kang, Hae-Ji; Lee, Dong-Hun; Chu, Ki-Back; Kumaran, Surjith; Armstrong, Sarah; Lalani, Romani; Choudhry, Shivanjali; Kim, Chun Il; Quan, Fu-Shi; Jeon, Byeonghwa; Choi, Hyo-Jick",Sci Rep,,344

MATERIAL AND METHODS: This cross-sectional study was carried out between 1 May and 30 June 2020. The study included 359 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 and assessed by clinical evaluation, nasopharyngeal polymerase chain reaction, and lung computed tomography. RESULTS: One hundred ninety-seven (54.9%) of the patients were male and 162 (45.1%) were female. The mean age of the patients was 58.5 years (20-91). Two hundred ninety-four (81.9%) patients were treated in the inpatient clinic and 65 (18.1%) patients were treated in the intensive care unit. Various ocular diseases were observed in 16 (4.5%) of the patients. Although the rate of ocular disease was 12 out of 294 (4.1%) in patients followed up in the inpatient clinic, this rate was 4 out of 65 (6.2%) in intensive care patients. There was no systemic problem in one patient, in whom conjunctival hyperemia was the first and only reason for admission to the hospital. Four patients followed up in the inpatient clinic had conjunctivitis at the time of admission, and conjunctivitis occurred in three patients during hospitalization. Subconjunctival hemorrhage occurred in five patients and vitreous hemorrhage in one patient.

369218,Multiscale Governance,2021-04-06,"The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted communities throughout the United States and worldwide. While the implications of the concomitant economic downturn for older adults are just beginning to be recognized, past experience suggests that the consequences could be devastating for many. Analyses indicate that more than one out of five Americans aged 65 years or older live in counties where high infection rates and high economic insecurity risks occur simultaneously. These findings highlight the overlap between current infection patterns and subsequent challenges to economic security that are impacting older people. Strategies and supports for getting people back to work must take into account the large segment of older people who rely on earnings well into later life. Social Security serves as the foundation of economic security for older adults across the income continuum, but it is frequently insufficient in and of itself, let alone during a crisis. Recognizing the importance of cost of living in shaping economic security highlights the need for the federal and state governments and municipalities to take older people into account in the economic recovery effort.","Li, Yang; Mutchler, Jan E",J Aging Soc Policy,,344

The overall death rate of COVID-19 pneumonia in the Chinese population was 4%.Objectives: To describe the process of hospitalization and critical care of patients who died of COVID-19 pneumonia.Methods: This was a multicenter observational study of 109 decedents with COVID-19 pneumonia from three hospitals in Wuhan. Demographic, clinical, laboratory, and treatment data were collected and analyzed, and the final date of follow-up was February 24, 2020.Results: The mean age of 109 decedents with COVID-19 pneumonia was 70.7 years, 35 patients (32.1%) were female, and 85 patients (78.0%) suffered from one or more underlying comorbidities. Multiple organ failure, especially respiratory failure and heart failure, appeared in all patients even at the early stage of disease. Overall, the mean time from onset of symptoms to death was 22.3 days. All 109 hospitalized patients needed admission to an intensive care unit (ICU); however, because of limited availability, only 51 (46.8%) could be admitted. The period from hospitalization to death in the ICU group and non-ICU group was 15.9 days (standard deviation = 8.8 d) and 12.5 days (8.6 d, P = 0.044), respectively.Conclusions: Mortality due to COVID-19 pneumonia was concentrated in patients above the age of 65 years, especially those with major comorbidities. Patients who were admitted to the ICU lived longer than those who were not. Our findings should aid in the recognition and clinical management of such infections, especially with regard to ICU resource allocation.","Du, Rong-Hui; Liu, Li-Min; Yin, Wen; Wang, Wen; Guan, Lu-Lu; Yuan, Ming-Li; Li, Yu-Lei; Hu, Yi; Li, Xu-Yan; Sun, Bing; Peng, Peng; Shi, Huan-Zhong",Ann Am Thorac Soc,,344
371358,Optimal Power Investment and Pandemics: A Micro-Economic Analysis,2021,"The COVID-19 pandemic can not only affect physical health, but also mental health, resulting in sleep problems, depression, and traumatic stress. Our research investigates the level of posttraumatic stress, perceived social support, opinions on positive and negative consequences of the pandemic, sense of security and sense of meaning among nurses in the face of this new and not fully understood global epidemiological phenomenon. For this purpose, computer-assisted web interviews were conducted between May 1 and May 15, 2020. Participating nurses completed the following research tools: The Impact Event Scale-Revised (IES-R), The Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support (MSPSS), The Changes in Outlook Questionnaire (CIOQ), The Safety Experience Questionnaire (SEQ) and The Meaning in Life Questionnaire (MLQ). Three hundred and twenty-five nurses of an average age of 39.18 ± 11.16 years and working throughout Poland joined the study. The average overall IES-R score in the study group was 1.78 ± 0.65. Among the dimensions of traumatic stress, the highest score was obtained in the ""avoidance"" dimension was 1.86 ± 0.73. Amongst participating nurses, the highest support rates were provided by significant others (22.58 ± 5.22). Higher average scores were noted among participants in the subscale measuring positive psychological changes (18.56 ± 4.04). The mean MLQ score was 5.33 ± 0.87. A slightly higher result was observed in the subscale ""presence"" (5.35 ± 1.14). The results of the research implemented during the period of severe psychological pressure associated with the COVID-19 pandemic provided information on symptoms of traumatic stress in the examined group of nurses. Their sense of security has been lowered and accompanied by an intensified reflection on issues concerning security. However, their current sense of meaning in life remains higher than the tendency to searching for it. The surveyed nurses received individual support mostly from significant others (i.e., other than family and friends). They see positive changes resulting from painful experiences related to the COVID-19 pandemic, which can be characterized by adaptation in the form of post-traumatic growth.","Nowicki, Grzegorz Józef; Slusarska, Barbara; Tucholska, Kinga; Naylor, Katarzyna; Chrzan-Rodak, Agnieszka; Niedorys, Barbara",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,344

COVID-19 is causing massive health problems and economic suffering around the world. The European Association for the Study of Obesity (EASO) promptly recognised the impact that the outbreak could have on people with obesity. On one side, emerging data suggest that obesity represents a risk factor for a more serious and complicated course of COVID-19 in adults. On the other side, the health emergency caused by the outbreak diverts attention from the prevention and care of noncommunicable chronic diseases to communicable diseases. This might be particularly true for obesity, a chronic and relapsing disease frequently neglected and linked to significant bias and stigmatization. The Obesity Management Task Force (OMTF) of EASO contributed to highligh the key aspects of these two sides of the coin and suggested some specific actions.","Busetto, L.",Obesity Facts,,344

The impact of this cessation of pain treatment may have unintended consequences of increased pain, reduced function, increased reliance on opioid medications and potential increased morbidity, due to the systemic impact of untreated disease burden. This may include decreased mobility, reduction in overall health status and increase of opioid use with the associated risks. METHODS: The article is the work of the American Society of Pain and Neuroscience (ASPN) COVID-19 Task Force to evaluate the policies set forth by federal, state, and local agencies to reduce or eliminate elective procedures for those patients with pain from spine, nerve and joint disease. The impact of these decisions, which were needed to reduce the spread of the pandemic, led to a delay in care for many patients. We hence review an emergence plan to reinitiate this pain-related care. The goal is to outline a path to work with federal, state, and local authorities to combat the spread of the pandemic and minimize the deleterious impact of pain and suffering on our chronic pain patients. RESULT: The paper sets forth a strategy for the interventional pain centers to reemerge from the current pandemic and to set a course for future events.","Deer, Timothy; Sayed, Dawood; Pope, Jason; Chakravarthy, Krishnan; Petersen, Erika; Moeschler, Susan M; Abd-Elsayed, Alaa; Amirdelfan, Kasra; Mekhail, Nagy",,,344

373992,Leveraging Information Bottleneck for Scientific Document Summarization,2021-10-04,"BACKGROUND: Professional identity development is an area of contemporary interest within medical education. It can be defined as 'the foundational process one experiences during the transformation from lay person to physician'. In order for this transformation to occur, medical values and principles are internalised. A robust professional identity is key to confident practice as a medical professional. As such, research regarding what works to encourage identity development is popular. New models of educational delivery, such as the increasingly popular Longitudinal Integrated Clerkship model (LICs), present an interesting opportunity to investigate impact on identity. As no previous literature reviews focus on identity development within LICs, it is unclear what is already known about their impact. Therefore, a scoping review synthesising current knowledge and mapping areas for future research is necessary. METHODS: Arksey and O'Malley's scoping review steps will be used as a methodological framework. MEDLINE, EMBASE, PubMed, Web of Knowledge, ERIC, PsychINFO, Google Scholar, JSTOR, Scopus, and Web of science will be searched (from inception onwards). We will include single studies of any design (e.g. quantitative and qualitative) and reviews examining professional identity within Longitudinal Integrated Clerkships involving health profession students. Two reviewers will complete all screening and data abstraction independently. Deductive coding will be presented as a quantitative textual meta-analysis. Inductive coding will be presented in narrative format. DISCUSSION: This scoping review will explore professional identity formation within LICs, evaluating any known impact of the educational model and mapping the ways in which identity within LICs has been researched. Mapping of current knowledge should highlight whether LICs as an educational model can influence professional identity development and outline gaps in what is known about their impact to date. Theory used in LIC-based identity research will also be mapped, in order to summarise the main theoretical orientations of research to date. It is anticipated that through such evidence synthesis, directions for future research will become clear.

The sudden interruptions of schooling and the pandemic itself caused parents to be anxious and to even panic. Mobile parenting skills education has been proved to be an effective method in improving the psychological well-being of mothers with autistic children. However, whether it can improve the psychological states of mothers in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic is an urgent subject to be investigated. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy of WeChat-based parenting training (WBPT) on anxiety, depression, parenting stress, and hope for mothers with autistic children as well as the feasibility of the program during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: This was a quasi-experimental trial. A total of 125 mothers with preschool autistic children were recruited in January 2020. The participants were assigned into the control group (n=60), receiving routine care, or the intervention group (n=65), receiving the 12-week WBPT plus routine care according to their preferences. Anxiety, depression, parenting stress, hope, satisfaction, and adherence to the intervention were measured at three timepoints: the baseline (T0), post-intervention (T1), and 20 weeks follow-up (T2). RESULTS: One hundred and nine mothers completed the T1 assessment and 104 mothers completed the T2 assessment. The results of the linear mixed model analysis showed statistically significant group*time interaction effects for the intervention on anxiety (F=14.219, P<.001), depression (F=26.563, P<.001), parenting stress (F=68.572, P<.001), and hope (F=197.608, P<.001). Of all mothers in the intervention group, 90.4% reported that they were extremely satisfied with the WBPT. In total, 40.0% kept the logging recordings for home training each week and 61.5% kept more than 80% for all 20 weeks. CONCLUSIONS: The WBPT is acceptable and appears to be an effective approach for reducing anxiety, depression, and parenting stress and increasing hope in mothers with autistic children during the global COVID-19 pandemic. Future studies with rigorous designs and longer follow-up periods are needed to further detect the effectiveness of the WBPT.

376294,Effects of information-induced behavioural changes during the COVID-19 lockdowns: the case of Italy,2020,"Radon inhalation decreases the level of lipid peroxide (LPO); this is attributed to the activation of antioxidative functions. This activation contributes to the beneficial effects of radon therapy, but there are no studies on the risks of radon therapy, such as DNA damage. We evaluated the effect of radon inhalation on DNA damage caused by oxidative stress and explored the underlying mechanisms. Mice were exposed to radon inhalation at concentrations of 2 or 20 kBq/m3 (for one, three, or 10 days). The 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) levels decreased in the brains of mice that inhaled 20 kBq/m3 radon for three days and in the kidneys of mice that inhaled 2 or 20 kBq/m3 radon for one, three or 10 days. The 8-OHdG levels in the small intestine decreased by approximately 20-40% (2 kBq/m3 for three days or 20 kBq/m3 for one, three or 10 days), but there were no significant differences in the 8-OHdG levels between mice that inhaled a sham treatment and those that inhaled radon. There was no significant change in the levels of 8-oxoguanine DNA glycosylase, which plays an important role in DNA repair. However, the level of Mn-superoxide dismutase (SOD) increased by 15-60% and 15-45% in the small intestine and kidney, respectively, following radon inhalation. These results suggest that Mn-SOD probably plays an important role in the inhibition of oxidative DNA damage.","Kataoka, Takahiro; Shuto, Hina; Naoe, Shota; Yano, Junki; Kanzaki, Norie; Sakoda, Akihiro; Tanaka, Hiroshi; Hanamoto, Katsumi; Mitsunobu, Fumihiro; Terato, Hiroaki; Yamaoka, Kiyonori",,,344

378000,"Q-Bot, the Quarantine Robot: Joint-media engagement between children and adults about quarantine living experiences",2020,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has created a need to prioritize care because of limitation of resources. Owing to the heterogeneity and high prevalence of breast cancers, the need to prioritize care in this vulnerable population is essential. While various medical societies have published recommendations to manage breast disease during the COVID-19 pandemic, most are focused on the Western world and do not necessarily address the challenges of a resource-limited setting. AIM: In this article, we describe our institutional approach for prioritizing care for patients presenting with breast disease. METHODS AND RESULTS: The breast disease management guidelines were developed and approved with the expertise of the Multidisciplinary Breast Program Leadership Committee (BPLC) of the Aga Khan University, Karachi, Pakistan. These guidelines were inspired, adapted, and modified keeping in view the needs of our resource-limited healthcare system. These recommendations are also congruent with the ethical guidelines developed by the Center of Biomedical Ethics and Culture (CBEC) at the Sindh Institute of Urology and Transplantation (SIUT), Karachi. Our institutional recommendations outline a framework to triage patients based on the urgency of care, scheduling conflicts, and tumor board recommendations, optimizing healthcare workers' schedules, operating room reallocation, and protocols. We also describe the ""Virtual Blended Clinics"", a resource-friendly means of conducting virtual clinics and a comprehensive plan for transitioning back into the post-COVID routine. CONCLUSION: Our institutional experience may be considered as a guide during the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly for triaging care in a resource-limited setting; however, these are not meant to be universally applicable, and individual cases must be tailored based on physicians' clinical judgment to provide the best quality care.","Sattar, Abida K; Shahzad, Hania; Jabbar, Adnan Abdul; ValiMohammed, Azmina T; Khan, Sadaf; Vellani, Yasmin; Idrees, Romana; Ali, Nasir; Masroor, Imrana; Saeed, Humera; Lakhani, Gulzar; Ayoub, Nadia; Waqar, Atif; Zia-Ul Islam, Muhammad; Kirmani, Salman; Latif, Asad; Enam, Syed Ather",Cancer Rep (Hoboken),,344

378877,Enhancing the performance of micro-biosensors by functionally graded geometrical and material parameters,2021,"In December 2019, the world was introduced to a new betacoronavirus, referred to as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) for its propensity to cause rapidly progressive lung damage, resulting in high death rates. As fast as the virus spread, it became evident that the novel coronavirus causes a multisystem disease (COVID-19) that may involve multiple organs and has a high risk of thrombosis associated with striking elevations in pro-inflammatory cytokines, D-dimer, and fibrinogen, but without disseminated intravascular coagulation. Postmortem studies have confirmed the high incidence of venous thromboembolism, but also notably revealed diffuse microvascular thrombi with endothelial swelling, consistent with a thrombotic microangiopathy, and inter-alveolar endothelial deposits of complement activation fragments. The clinicopathologic presentation of COVID-19 thus parallels that of other thrombotic diseases, such as atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS), that are caused by dysregulation of the complement system. This raises the specter that many of the thrombotic complications arising from SARS-CoV-2 infections may be triggered and/or exacerbated by excess complement activation. This is of major potential clinical relevance, as currently available anti-complement therapies that are highly effective in protecting against thrombosis in aHUS, could be efficacious in COVID-19. In this review, we provide mounting evidence for complement participating in the pathophysiology underlying the thrombotic diathesis associated with pathogenic coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2. Based on current knowledge of complement, coagulation and the virus, we suggest lines of study to identify novel therapeutic targets and the rationale for clinical trials with currently available anti-complement agents for COVID-19.","Conway, Edward M; Pryzdial, Edward L G",J. thromb. haemost,,344

METHODS: In this single-center and retrospective study, patients with confirmed COVID-19 infections were enrolled. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression methods were used to explore the risk factors associated with outcomes. RESULTS: Of 179 patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection, 12 remained hospitalized at the end of the study and 167 were included in the final analysis. Of these, 153 (91.6%) were discharged and 14 (8.38%) died in hospital. Approximately half (50.9%) of patients suffered from a comorbidity, with diabetes or coronary heart disease being the most common in 20 patients. The most common symptoms on admission were fever, dyspnea, and cough. The mean durations from first symptoms to hospital admission was 8.64 ± 4.14 days, whereas the mean hospitalization time to discharge or death was 5.19 ± 2.42 and 4.35 ± 2.70 days, respectively.

Government-coordinated efforts across the globe have focused on containment and mitigation, with varying degrees of success. Countries that have maintained low COVID-19 per-capita mortality rates appear to share strategies that include early surveillance, testing, contact tracing, and strict quarantine. The scale of coordination and data management required for effective implementation of these strategies has—in most successful countries—relied on adopting digital technology and integrating it into policy and health care.

Methods: This is a cross-sectional study that was conducted from January 2018 to May 2019 in Rasht (North of Iran). The participants included 215 menopausal women and their spouses. Data were collected using the demographic questionnaire, the Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI) questionnaire, and the International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF) questionnaire. Results: On the basis of the FSFI and IIEF scores, 36.28% (78/215) women reported female sexual dysfunction (FSD) and 17.2% (37/215) men reported erectile dysfunction (ED) with 8.37% (N = 18) being mild, 5.58% (N = 12) mild to moderate, and 3.25% (N = 7) moderate ED. After adjusting differences in the female age distribution, the total score and scores of the IIEF subscales were also not significantly lower in the spouses of women with FSD than women without FSD. Conclusion: Although, significant correlations between male erectile function and menopausal female sexual function have not identified; but, low scores of the subscales of FSFI in female participants mostly impaired sexual satisfaction and overall satisfaction in their spouses.","Khalesi, Zahra Bostani; Jafarzadeh-Kenarsari, Fatemeh; Mobarrez, Yalda Donyaei; Abedinzade, Mahmood",Afr Health Sci,,344

Although the diagnostics of acute patients by RT-PCR is both efficient and specific, we are also crucially in need of serological tools for investigating antibody responses and assessing individual and potential herd immunity. We evaluated a commercially available test developed for rapid (within 15 minutes) detection of SARS-CoV-2-specific IgM and IgG by 29 PCR-confirmed COVID-19 cases and 124 negative controls. The results revealed a sensitivity of 69% and 93.1% for IgM and IgG, respectively, based solely on PCR-positivity due to the absence of a serological gold standard. The assay specificities were shown to be 100% for IgM and 99.2% for IgG. This indicates that the test is suitable for assessing previous virus exposure, although negative results may be unreliable during the first weeks after infection.

The model was calibrated using data on the confirmed cases and death from several countries like France, Philippines, Italy, Spain, United Kingdom, China, and the USA. First, we derived the basic reproduction number, $\mathcal{R}_0$, and estimated the effective reproduction $\mathcal{R}_{\rm eff}$ for each country. Second, we were interested in the merits of interventions, either by distancing or by treatment. Results revealed that total and partial containment is effective in reducing the transmission. However, its duration may be long to eradicate the disease (104 days for France). By setting the end of intervention as the day when hospital capacity is reached, numerical simulations showed that the duration can be reduced (up to only 39 days for France if the capacity is 1000 patients). Further, results pointed out that the effective reproduction number remains large after containment. Therefore, testing and isolation are necessary to stop the disease.","Arcede, Jayrold P.; Caga-anan, Randy L.; Mentuda, Cheryl Q.; Mammeri, Youcef",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.01805v2.pdf,344

The aim of the present study was to develop and evaluate the performance characteristics of a new Bioelectric Recognition Assay (BERA) regarding Sars-CoV-2 detection in clinical samples and its potential to be used as a point of care test. MATERIALS AND METHODS: All tests were performed using a custom portable hardware device developed by EMBIO DIAGNOSTICS (EMBIO DIAGNOSTICS Ltd, Cyprus). 110 positive and 136 negative samples tested by RT-PCR were used in order to define the lower limit of detection (L.O.D.) of the system, as well as the sensitivity and the specificity of the method. RESULTS: The system was able to detect a viral concentration of 4 genome copies/µL. The method displayed total sensitivity of 92.7 % (95 %CI: 86.2-96.8) and 97.8 % specificity (95 %CI: 93.7-99.5). When samples were grouped according to the recorded Ct values the BERA biosensor displayed 100.00 % sensitivity (95 %CI: 84.6-100.0) for Ct values <20-30. For the aforementioned Ct values the Positive Predictive Value (PPV) of the method was estimated at 31.4 % for COVID-19 prevalence of 1% and at 70.5 % for 5% prevalence. At the same time the Negative Predictive Value (NPV) of the BERA biosensor was at 100.0 % for both prevalence rates. CONCLUSIONS: EMBIO DIAGNOSTICS BERA for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 infection has the potential to allow rapid and cost-effective detection and subsequent isolation of confirmed cases, and therefore reduce household and community transmissions.","Apostolou, Theofylaktos; Kyritsi, Maria; Vontas, Alexandros; Loizou, Konstantinos; Hadjilouka, Agni; Speletas, Mathaios; Mouchtouri, Varvara; Hadjichristodoulou, Christos",J Virol Methods,,344
384721,Joint inference on extreme expectiles for multivariate heavy-tailed distributions,2020-07-17,"BACKGROUND: In the context of the COVID-19 worldwide pandemic, an up-to-date review of current challenges in addictions is necessary. While large scale disasters may have an impact on substance use and addictions, the use of some substances is also likely to modify the risk of COVID-19 infection or course. Many countries have imposed lockdowns. Whether this quarantine or the end of lockdown measures will have an impact on substance use is discussed. The aim of this review is to gather knowledge for clinicians and to guide public health policies during/after lockdown. METHODS: PubMed was reviewed in August 6th (2020), to determine the current evidences and observations concerning the addictions and SARS-CoV2. We used all the names of the severe acute respiratory syndrome of coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2 previously 2019 nCoV), the name of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), and common substances of abuse. For the physiopathological parts, searches were conducted using key words such as ""infection"" or ""pneumonia"". For the lockdown effects, key words such as ""quarantine"", ""disaster"" or ""outbreak"" were used. RESULTS: Overall, pathophysiological data showed an increased risk of infections for individuals with Substance Use Disorders (SUD) and a possible protective role of nicotine. During lockdown, there is a substantial risk of increasing SUDs. Individuals with opioid use disorder are particularly at risk of relapse or of involuntary withdrawal. After lockdown, increase of use may be observed as far as years after. Individuals with addictions are at higher risk of multimorbidity and mortality during COVID outbreak. CONCLUSION: This review describes useful strategies in clinical practice, including a systematic assessment of addiction comorbidity during this almost worldwide lockdown/pandemic. This review also highlights important areas for future research.","Mallet, Jasmina; Dubertret, Caroline; Le Strat, Yann",Prog Neuropsychopharmacol Biol Psychiatry,,344

Mathematical modelling and forecasting efforts have been widely used to inform policy-making and to create situational awareness. Methods and FindingsFrom 8th March to 29th November 2020, we produced weekly estimates of SARS-CoV-2 transmissibility and forecasts of deaths due to COVID-19 for countries with evidence of sustained transmission. The estimates and forecasts were based on an ensemble model comprising of three models that were calibrated using only the reported number of COVID-19 cases and deaths in each country. We also developed a novel heuristic to combine weekly estimates of transmissibility and potential changes in population immunity due to infection to produce forecasts over a 4-week horizon. We evaluated the robustness of the forecasts using relative error, coverage probability, and comparisons with null models. ConclusionsDuring the 39-week period covered by this study, we produced short- and medium-term forecasts for 81 countries. Both the short- and medium-term forecasts captured well the epidemic trajectory across different waves of COVID-19 infections with small relative errors over the forecast horizon. The model was well calibrated with 56.3% and 45.6% of the observations lying in the 50% Credible Interval in 1-week and 4-week ahead forecasts respectively. We could accurately characterise the overall phase of the epidemic up to 4-weeks ahead in 84.9% of country-days. The medium-term forecasts can be used in conjunction with the short-term forecasts of COVID-19 mortality as a useful planning tool as countries continue to relax stringent public health measures that were implemented to contain the pandemic.","Bhatia, Sangeeta; Parag, Kris V; Wardle, Jack; Imai, Natsuko; Elsland, Sabine L Van; Lassmann, Britta; Cuomo-Dannenburg, Gina; Jauneikaite, Elita; Unwin, H.

Their urgent deployment was defended with modelling and observational data of spurious credibility. There is major debate on whether these measures are effective and there is also uncertainty about the magnitude of the harms that these measures might induce. Given that there is equipoise for how, when and if specific social distancing interventions for COVID-19 should be applied and removed/modified during reopening, we argue that informative randomised-controlled trials are needed. Only a few such randomised trials have already been conducted, but the ones done to-date demonstrate that a randomised trials agenda is feasible. We discuss here issues of study design choice, selection of comparators (intervention and controls), choice of outcomes and additional considerations for the conduct of such trials.

Qualitative faecal immunochemical tests (FITs) have been used for suspected CRC in Sweden since the mid-2000s, but evidence regarding their effectiveness is scarce. Anaemia and thrombocytosis are both associated with CRC. AIM: To evaluate the usefulness of qualitative FITs requested for symptomatic patients in primary care, alone and combined with findings of anaemia and thrombocytosis, in the diagnosis of CRC. DESIGN AND SETTING: A population-based cohort study using electronic health records and data from the Swedish Cancer Register, covering five Swedish regions. METHOD: Patients aged &#8805;18 years in the five regions who had provided FITs requested by primary care practitioners from 1 January 2015 to 31 December 2015 were identified. FIT and blood-count data were registered and all CRC diagnoses made within 2 years were retrieved. Diagnostic measurements were calculated. RESULTS: In total, 15 789 patients provided FITs (four different brands); of these patients, 304 were later diagnosed with CRC. Haemoglobin levels were available for 13 863 patients, and platelet counts for 10 973 patients. Calculated for the different FIT brands only, the sensitivities for CRC were 81.6%-100%; specificities 65.7%-79.5%; positive predictive values 4.7%-8.1%; and negative predictive values 99.5%-100%. Calculated for the finding of either a positive FIT or anaemia, the sensitivities increased to 88.9-100%. Adding thrombocytosis did not further increase the diagnostic performance. CONCLUSION: Qualitative FITs requested in primary care seem to be useful as rule-in tests for referral when CRC is suspected. A negative FIT and no anaemia indicate a low risk of CRC.","Högberg, Cecilia; Gunnarsson, Ulf; Jansson, Stefan; Thulesius, Hans; Cronberg, Olof; Lilja, Mikael",Br.j.gen.pract,,344

This study aims to summarize basic reproduction number (R0) data and provide clues for designing prevention and control measures. METHODS: Several databases and preprint platforms were retrieved for literature reporting R0 values of COVID-19. The analysis was stratified by the prespecified modeling method to make the R0 values comparable, and by country/region to explore whether R0 estimates differed across the world. The average R0 values were pooled using a random-effects model. RESULTS: We identified 185 unique articles, yielding 43 articles for analysis. The selected studies covered 5 countries from Asia, 5 countries from Europe, 12 countries from Africa, and 1 from North America, South America, and Australia each. Exponential growth rate model was most favored by researchers. The pooled global R0 was 4.08 (95% CI, 3.09-5.39). The R0 estimates for new and shifting epicenters were comparable or even higher than that for the original epicenter Wuhan, China.

The solution provides a tool for analyzing density of targets in a specific area, useful when checking contact proximities of a target along a route. The principle consists of the detection of mobile devices that use active Bluetooth connections, such as personal notebooks, smartphones, smartwatches, Bluetooth headphones, etc. to locate and track their movement in the dedicated area. For this purpose, a specific configuration of three BT sensors is used and RSSI levels compared, based on a combination of differential location estimates. The solution may also be suited for indoor localization where GPS signals are usually weak or missing; for example, in public places such as subway stations or trains, hospitals, airport terminals and so on. The applicability of this solution is estimated to be vast, ranging from travel and transport information services, route guidance, passenger flows tracking, and path recovery for persons suspected to have SARS-COV2 or other contagious viruses, serving epidemiologic enquiries. The specific configuration of Bluetooth detectors may be installed either in a fixed location, or in a public transport vehicle. A set of filters and algorithms for triangulation-based location of detected targets and movement tracking, based on artificial intelligence is employed. When applied in the public transport field, this setup can be also developed to extract additional information on traffic, such as private traffic flowing, or passenger movement patterns along the vehicle route, improved location in absence of GPS signals, etc. Field tests have been carried out for determining different aspects concerning indoor location accuracy, reliability, selection of targets and filtering.

Most rheumatology textbooks are now available in digital formats, and these are complemented with live updating educational hubs such as UpToDate and ClinicalKey. Emerging topics of COVID-19 on these proprietary platforms are now freely available to all specialists. Social media channels, particularly Twitter, are becoming major players in the era of COVID-19 by offering online journal clubs, enabling fast dissemination of influential articles, and facilitating interactive education. Indexed rheumatology journals, in turn, aid online education by opening access to recommendations and other materials that are rapidly changing research and practice worldwide. Research peer review additionally offers learning experience to novice and seasoned researchers and authors. Global rheumatology societies have online learning resources, which are changing their format and geographic reach to meet the changing needs in the times of pandemic. While online teaching lacks emotional connections between mentors and mentees, switch to a more interactive format of education and regular contacts may partly solve the issue.

A gender gap was observed, with a more relevant reduction for female patients. Arrhythmic urgencies requiring a device implant showed a reduced time from symptoms to first medical contact but the time from first medical contact to procedure was significantly prolonged.Conclusion: Hospitals need to consider how outbreaks may affect health systems beyond the immediate infection. Routine activity should be based on a risk assessment between the prompt performance of procedure and its postponement.

Repurposing approved drugs can provide therapeutic alternatives that promise rapid and ample coverage because they have a documented safety record, as well as infrastructure for large-scale production. The main protease of SARS-CoV-2 (Mpro) is an excellent therapeutic target because it is critical for viral replication; however, Mpro has a highly flexible active site that must be considered when performing computer-assisted drug discovery. In this work, potential inhibitors of the main protease (Mpro) of SARS-Cov-2 were identified through a docking-assisted virtual screening procedure. A total of 4384 drugs, all approved for human use, were screened against three conformers of Mpro. The ligands were further studied through molecular dynamics simulations and binding free energy analysis. A total of nine currently approved molecules are proposed as potential inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2. These molecules can be further tested to speed the development of therapeutics against COVID-19.","Jiménez-Alberto, Alicia; Ribas-Aparicio, Rosa María; Aparicio-Ozores, Gerardo; Castelán-Vega, Juan A",Comput Biol Chem,,344

On the Rise and Fall of the Modern Time Regime,2021,"Modern epidemiological analyses to understand and combat the spread of disease depend critically on access to, and use of, data. Rapidly evolving data, such as data streams changing during a disease outbreak, are particularly challenging. Data management is further complicated by data being imprecisely identified when used. Public trust in policy decisions resulting from such analyses is easily damaged and is often low, with cynicism arising where claims of""following the science""are made without accompanying evidence. Tracing the provenance of such decisions back through open software to primary data would clarify this evidence, enhancing the transparency of the decision-making process. Here, we demonstrate a Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable (FAIR) data pipeline developed during the COVID-19 pandemic that allows easy annotation of data as they are consumed by analyses, while tracing the provenance of scientific outputs back through the analytical source code to data sources. Such a tool provides a mechanism for the public, and fellow scientists, to better assess the trust that should be placed in scientific evidence, while allowing scientists to support policy-makers in openly justifying their decisions. We believe that tools such as this should be promoted for use across all areas of policy-facing research.","Mitchell, Sonia Natalie; Lahiff, Andrew; Cummings, Nathan; Hollocombe, Jonathan; Boskamp, Bram; Reddyhoff, Dennis; Field, Ryan; Zarebski, Kristian; Wilson, Antony; Burke, Martin; Archibald, Blair; Bessell, Paul; Blackwell, Richard; Boden, Lisa A; Brett, Alys; Brett, Sam; Dundas, Ruth; Enright, Jessica; Gonzalez-Beltran, Alejandra N.; Harris, Claire; Hinder, Ian; Hughes, Christopher David; Knight, Martin; Mano, Vino; McMonagle, Ciaran; Mellor, Dominic; Mohr, Sibylle; Marion, Glenn; Matthews, Louise; McKendrick, Iain J.; Pooley, Christopher Mark; Porphyre, Thibaud; Reeves, Aaron; Townsend, Edward; Turner, Robert; Walton, Jeremy; Reeve, Richard",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2110.07117v1.pdf,344

Although a few studies have assessed the clinical course of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), the changes in clinical characteristics during disease progression remain unclear. Methods: We retrospectively analyzed the clinical characteristics of 62 patients who died from COVID-19 at the Central Hospital of Wuhan between January 26 and February 17, 2020. We compared the clinical features on admission and at the last follow-up before death. Results: Of the 62 patients with COVID-19, 41 (66%) patients were male, and 21 (34%) were female. The median age was 72 years (interquartile range (IQR), 54-88), and 45 (72.5%) patients had preexisting conditions. The median time from symptom onset to the first visit at the clinic was three days, while the median time from symptom onset to death was 18.5 days. During disease progression, the amounts of arterial gases worsened, and liver, renal, and heart dysfunction was observed. Due to the cytokine storm, infection-related biomarkers, including lactic acid, C-reactive protein, and interleukine-6, gradually worsened during hospitalization. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that during hospitalization, many COVID-19 patients experienced multiple organ dysfunction and cytokine storm. The time from symptom onset to death was only 18.5 days, highlighting the disease's rapid progression. The better understanding of the clinical changes during disease progression might provide further insight into the COVID-19 pathophysiology.","Chen, Jingli; Ye, Jishi; Li, Hui; Xia, Zhongyuan; Yan, Hong",Biomed Res Int,,344

391494,Vibration-based elastic parameter identification of the diploë and cortical tables in dry cranial bones,2021,"The COVID-19 pandemic has become a major worldwide crisis. Although respiratory symptoms are a key feature of the disease, many people who are hospitalized with COVID-19 also suffer acute kidney injury, a condition that exacerbates patient mortality and may have to be treated through renal replacement therapy. Much of the focus on hospital capacity during the pandemic has centered on the availability of ventilators. However, supplies for dialysis treatment, including dialysate, have also run dangerously low in hospitals at the epicenter of the pandemic. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop materials that can efficiently and rapidly regenerate dialysate, removing toxins and restoring electrolyte concentrations so that this vital resource remains readily available. In this work, Ti3C2Tx, a two-dimensional transition-metal carbide (MXene) that is known to efficiently adsorb urea, was used to remove creatinine and uric acid from an aqueous solution and dialysate, with a maximum adsorption capacity of 45.7 and 17.0 mg/g, respectively. We systematically analyzed and modeled the adsorption kinetics, isotherms, and thermodynamics, thus determining the rate-limiting step and adsorption mechanism. A fixed-bed column loaded with Ti3C2Tx was designed to further evaluate the adsorption performance under continuous fluid-flow conditions, mirroring conditions of continuous renal replacement therapy modalities. The maximum capacity and 50% breakthrough volume were calculated to further approach the practical application of Ti3C2Tx for removal of uremic toxins. Our findings suggest that Ti3C2Tx has the potential to be used as an efficient sorbent for the regeneration of dialysate, allowing for accelerated dialysate regeneration by removing filtered toxins and leading to more portable dialysis devices.","Zhao, Qi; Seredych, Mykola; Precetti, Eliot; Shuck, Christopher E; Harhay, Meera; Pang, Rui; Shan, Chong-Xin; Gogotsi, Yury",ACS Nano,,344

Another consideration is that EVALI may have an adverse influence on the outcome of intercurrent respiratory infections. We document this deadly combination in the case of a young man who had EVALI and simultaneous 41 Influenza-A infection leading to severe Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). CASE PRESENTATION: A 27-year-old male with a history of tobacco and vaping use was admitted to hospital after two weeks of flu-like symptoms, diarrhea and vomiting. A chest x-ray was consistent with multifocal pneumonia, and microbiological tests were positive for Influenza-A and methicillin-sensitive Staphalacoccus aureus (MSSA). Bronchoscopy provided evidence of acute inhalational injury. After admission, he acutely decompensated with severe hypoxia and hypotension; he required intubation, sedation and vasopressors. He developed sepsis with acute kidney failure, liver failure, biventricular systolic dysfunction and severe rhabdomyolysis. He was placed on veno-venous (VV) extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) initially and later changed to Veno-Arterial (VA) ECMO. Nevertheless, the patient continued to deteriorate, and he expired two weeks after admission. CONCLUSION: This case documents that EVALI can act as a major factor leading a respiratory infection to progress into severe ARDS with a fatal outcome.","Akkanti, Bindu H; Hussain, Rahat; Patel, Manish K; Patel, Jayeshkumar A; Dinh, Kha; Zhao, Bihong; Elzamly, Shaimaa; Pelicon, Kevin; Petek, Klemen; Salas de Armas, Ismael A; Akay, Mehmet; Kar, Biswajit; Gregoric, Igor D; Buja, L Maximilian",Diagn Pathol,,344

The mandate to prevent an influenza epidemic has increased with the COVID-19 pandemic. However, isolation restrictions have reduced interactions with healthcare professionals. We aimed to determine whether these barriers could be overcome by offering vaccination via an ambulatory setting for the first time. METHODS: During a 12-week period, patients receiving care through the Hospital-in-the-Home programme were offered immunisation during their home visit. Logistical cold chain barriers were addressed, and patient acceptance was measured. RESULTS: Cooler boxes with temperature loggers were designed to monitor the cold chain. 157 eligible patients were contacted, of whom 96 (61%) consented and received in-home injectable influenza vaccine, with no major adverse events. 52/96 (54%) were first-time influenza vaccine recipients. Most refusals (28/41, 68%) were for immunisation concerns, not home administration. CONCLUSION: This pilot shows ambulatory influenza vaccination is feasible, safe and overcomes some barriers.","Nisbet, Lauren Claire; Cobbledick, Annie M; Smith, Tessa E; Bryant, Penelope A; Lawrence, Joanna",Arch. dis. child,,344

METHODS: To address gaps in local contact tracing, health professional students partnered with their academic institution to conduct contact tracing for all COVID-19 cases diagnosed onsite, which included identifying and reaching their contacts, educating participants, and providing social resources to support effective quarantine and isolation. RESULTS: From March 24 to May 28, 536 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases were contacted and reported an average of 2.6 contacts. Contacts were informed of their exposure, asked to quarantine, and monitored for the onset of symptoms. Callers reached 94% of cases and 84% of contacts. Seventy-four percent of cases reported at least one contact. Household members had higher rates of reporting symptoms (odds ratio, 1.65; 95% confidence interval, 1.19-2.28). The average test turnaround time decreased from 21.8 days for the first patients of this program to 2.3 days on the eleventh week.

Clinical sensitivities of assessed IgG tests two to three weeks post symptom onset (PSO) were very high: 96.77 % for Architect, 96.77 % for Chorus, and 100.00 % for VIDAS. Sensitivities of two assessed IgM assays were moderate: 74.07 % for Chorus, and 76.92 % for VIDAS. Specificities were excellent for all assessed IgG assays: 99.01 % for Architect and 100 % for Chorus and VIDAS. Chorus and VIDAS IgM assays also achieved excellent specificity of 99.01 % and 100 %, respectively. In most cases IgG Abs were still present eight months PSO. Neutralizing antibodies were detected in majority of serum samples from convalescent patients. Serum samples from severe COVID-19 patients had higher antibody titers and higher neutralizing activity.

To determine the prevalence of these symptoms and to evaluate their diagnostic significance, we (approximately 150 physicians of the Daegu Medical Association) prospectively collected data of cases of anosmia and ageusia from March 8, 2020, via telephone interview among 3,191 patients in Daegu, Korea. Acute anosmia or ageusia was observed in 15.3% (488/3,191) patients in the early stage of COVID-19 and in 15.7% (367/2,342) patients with asymptomatic-to-mild disease severity. Their prevalence was significantly more common among females and younger individuals (P = 0.01 and P < 0.001, respectively). Most patients with anosmia or ageusia recovered within 3 weeks. The median time to recovery was 7 days for both symptoms. Anosmia and ageusia seem to be part of important symptoms and clues for the diagnosis of COVID-19, particularly in the early stage of the disease.","Lee, Yonghyun; Min, Pokkee; Lee, Seonggu; Kim, Shin Woo",J Korean Med Sci,,344

400915,A Proline-Based Tectons and Supramolecular Synthons for Drug Design 2.0: A Case Study of ACEI,2020,"OBJECTIVE: While the safety and efficacy of convection-enhanced delivery (CED) have been studied in patients receiving single-dose drug infusions, agents for oncological therapy may require repeated or chronic infusions to maintain therapeutic drug concentrations. Repeat and chronic CED infusions have rarely been described for oncological purposes. Currently available CED devices are not approved for extended indwelling use, and the only potential at this time is for sequential treatments through multiple procedures. The authors report on the safety and experience in a group of pediatric patients who received sequential CED into the brainstem for the treatment of diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma. METHODS: Patients in this study were enrolled in a phase I single-center clinical trial using 124I-8H9 monoclonal antibody (124I-omburtamab) administered by CED (clinicaltrials.gov identifier NCT01502917). A retrospective chart and imaging review were used to assess demographic data, CED infusion data, and postoperative neurological and surgical outcomes. MRI scans were analyzed using iPlan Flow software for volumetric measurements. Target and catheter coordinates as well as radial, depth, and absolute error in MRI space were calculated with the ClearPoint imaging software. RESULTS: Seven patients underwent 2 or more sequential CED infusions. No patients experienced Clinical Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events grade 3 or greater deficits. One patient had a persistent grade 2 cranial nerve deficit after a second infusion. No patient experienced hemorrhage or stroke postoperatively. There was a statistically significant decrease in radial error (p = 0.005) and absolute tip error (p = 0.008) for the second infusion compared with the initial infusion. Sequential infusions did not result in significantly different distribution capacities between the first and second infusions (volume of distribution determined by the PET signal/volume of infusion ratio [mean ± SD]: 2.66 ± 0.35 vs 2.42 ± 0.75; p = 0.45). CONCLUSIONS: This series demonstrates the ability to safely perform sequential CED infusions into the pediatric brainstem. Past treatments did not negatively influence the procedural workflow, technical application of the targeting interface, or distribution capacity. This limited experience provides a foundation for using repeat CED for oncological purposes.","Bander, Evan D; Ramos, Alexander D; Wembacher-Schroeder, Eva; Ivasyk, Iryna; Thomson, Rowena; Morgenstern, Peter F; Souweidane, Mark M",J Neurosurg Pediatr,,344

401786,The Remains of the Day: The International Economic Order in the Era of Disintegration*,2020,"Background: On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic, and on February 28, Mexico reported its first case. Internationally, cases in newborns are few and the outcomes, in general, are good. There is no certainty of possible vertical transmission, and the presence of the virus in human milk is improbable. The gold standard for diagnosis is the reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test. We performed a literature review and presented a case of perinatal COVID-19. Clinical case: We describe the case of a full-term male infant with a birth weight of 3450 g and history of rooming-in with another mother-baby pair, both positive for SARS-CoV-2. On the second day of life, the neonate developed pneumonia, with clinical, X-ray and ultrasound diagnostic confirmation. On the third day of life, RT-PCR was positive for SARS-CoV-2; the mother was also positive but remained asymptomatic. The patient required mechanical ventilation and was transferred to a tertiary level neonatal unit on day 5 of life, where congenital heart disease was ruled out. He evolved satisfactorily with a negative RT-PCR test for SARS-CoV-2 on day 8 and was extubated and discharged on day 21 of life. Telephone follow-up was performed without complications. Conclusions: The present case was classified as horizontal transmission with a short incubation period of COVID-19.","Lima-Rogel, Victoria; Villegas-Silva, Raúl; Coronado-Zarco, Alejandra; Estrada-Ruelas, Isaac; Vega, Alma R Sánchez-De la; Muro-Flores, Raúl H; Villa-Guillén, Mónica",Bol Med Hosp Infant Mex,,344
402430,Detecting Propaganda Techniques in Memes,2021-08-07,"RATIONALE: ACE2, a critical SARS-CoV-2 entry receptor, has reduced expression in those with allergic sensitizations. Consequently, SARS-CoV-2 infections may impact patients with allergic asthma (AA) or no evidence of allergic asthma (NEAA) differently. We explore demographics of SARS-CoV-2-infected AA and NEAA patients. METHODS: Retrospective data were obtained from the US-representative COVID-19 Optum Electronic Health Record dataset through 10/15/2020. Index was the earliest date of presumed diagnosis or laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection (CDC guidelines) from 02/20/2020, defined as (1) diagnosis code of U07.1/U07.2, or (2) positive diagnostic test for SARS-CoV-2, (3) diagnosis code of B97.29 without a negative molecular SARS-CoV-2 test within a 14-day window (+/-7 days). Patients SARS-CoV-2-positive with evidence of moderate-to-severe asthma at any time (ICD-10 J45.4X or J45.5X) were included. AA was defined as positive specific IgE (≥0.35 kU/L) serum test or skin prick test (code 95004) ordered by a specialist (eg, allergist, pulmonologist, dermatologist) or omalizumab use. NEAA was defined as failing to meet the AA definition and patients with allergic comorbidities were excluded. Baseline demographic and clinical characteristics were obtained 6-12 months before COVID-19 diagnosis. RESULTS: The database included 242,280 SARS-CoV-2-positive patients;569 (0.2%) had evidence of comorbid AA and 3137 (1.3%) had asthma and NEAA. For AA patients, mean (SD) age at index was 48.2 (18.2) years;70.3% were female, with 54.3% White, 26.4% Black, and 12.5% Hispanic (Table 1). Most AA patients were from the US Midwest and Northeast (80.5%). NEAA patients had similar demographics: mean (SD) age at index was 50.7 (19.5) years;67.6% female;with 60.0% White, 21.5% Black, and 13.0% Hispanic;and 81.5% were from the US Midwest and Northeast. A greater proportion of patients had severe asthma in AA versus NEAA groups (220/569 [38.7%] versus 457/3137 [14.6%]). More patients with AA versus NEAA used asthma biologic treatment (62/569 [10.9%] vs 27/3137 [0.9%]). Comorbid conditions (hypertension, diabetes, pregnancy, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and Charlson Comorbidity Index), body mass index, and smoking history were comparable between groups. A higher proportion of NEAA patients were current smokers. CONCLUSIONS: A smaller proportion of patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection in this retrospective analysis had comorbid AA versus NEAA, whereas patient demographics and comorbidities were generally comparable between groups. Differences included the proportion of patients with severe asthma and biologic treatment use (greater in AA), and current smoking (lower in AA). The observed lower prevalence of AA versus NEAA in SARS-CoV-2-positive patients warrants further investigation.","Kaner, R. J.; Murphy, T.

405839,The Bitcoin VIX and Its Variance Risk Premium,2021,"BACKGROUND: During medical procedures with the potential to produce aerosols such as bronchoscopy, intubation, or CPR, health-care workers (HCWs) may be exposed to infectious bioaerosols. This scenario is of particular concern when high consequence pathogens such as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) are circulating. Thousands of HCWs have been infected with SARS-CoV-2. However, the determinants of aerosol generation during medical procedures and their relative risk to HCWs remain poorly characterized. RESEARCH QUESTION: The goal of this study was to characterize aerosols produced during airway intubation by using an uninfected translational animal model and in human subjects undergoing elective aerosol-generating procedures. The study also determined the particle size distribution of generated particles. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Aerosol generation was measured during highly controlled experimental (pig) intubations (N = 16) and elective bronchoscopies in uninfected patients (N = 49) using an optical particle counter. Recovery of normal respiratory flora was used as a surrogate for pathogen dispersion. RESULTS: There was a small but significant (P = .03) decrease in 0.3 µm size particles during highly controlled pig intubations compared with baseline. The concentration of 1.0 µm and 5.0 µm aerosol particles did not significantly change, although oral bacteria were collected from the air. For elective patient bronchoscopies, there was a significant decrease in the generation of larger particles (1.0 µm and 5.0 µm) compared with baseline (P < .01); however, 18 of 39 (46%) patients showed increased aerosol production in 0.3 µm size particles, four of whom exhibited measurable increases. INTERPRETATION: Although the total amount of aerosols produced during intubation and bronchoscopy did not increase significantly relative to preprocedural levels, a small number of participants exhibited a measurable increase in submicron particle emission, meriting further research to delineate determinants of fine particle production during aerosol-generating procedures.","Doggett, Nathan; Chow, Chung-Wai; Mubareka, Samira",Chest,,344

408413,A geometric analysis of the SIRS epidemiological model on a homogeneous network,2020-11-04,"BACKGROUND: Neutralizing-antibody (nAb) is the major focus of most ongoing COVID-19 vaccine trials. However, nAb response against SARS-CoV-2, when present, decays rapidly. Given the myriad roles of antibodies in immune responses, it is possible that antibodies could also mediate protection against SARS-CoV-2 via effector mechanisms such as antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC), which we sought to explore here. METHODS: Plasma of 3 uninfected controls and 20 subjects exposed to, or recovering from, SARS-CoV-2 infection were collected from U.S. and sub-Saharan Africa. Immunofluorescence assay was used to detect the presence of SARS-CoV-2 specific IgG antibodies in the plasma samples. SARS-CoV-2 specific neutralizing capability of these plasmas was assessed with SARS-CoV-2 spike pseudotyped virus. ADCC activity was assessed with a calcein release assay. RESULTS: SARS-CoV-2 specific IgG antibodies were detected in all COVID-19 subjects studied. All but three COVID-19 subjects contained nAb at high potency (>80% neutralization). Plasma from 19/20 of COVID-19 subjects also demonstrated strong ADCC activity against SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein, including two individuals without nAb against SARS-CoV-2. CONCLUSION: Both neutralizing and non-neutralizing COVID-19 plasmas can mediate ADCC. Our findings argue that evaluation of potential vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 should include investigation of the magnitude and durability of ADCC, in addition to nAb.","Tso, For Yue; Lidenge, Salum J; Poppe, Lisa K; Peña, Phoebe B; Privatt, Sara R; Bennett, Sydney J; Ngowi, John R; Mwaiselage, Julius; Belshan, Michael; Siedlik, Jacob A; Raine, Morgan A; Ochoa, Juan B; Garcia-Diaz, Julia; Nossaman, Bobby; Buckner, Lyndsey; Roberts, W Mark; Dean, Matthew J; Ochoa, Augusto C; West, John T; Wood, Charles",PLoS One,,344

The virus thereby exploits structural disadvantages, rooted partly in historical and contemporary anti-Black sentiments, working against African Americans. These include higher rates of comorbid illness and more limited health care access, higher rates of disadvantageous labor market positioning and community and housing conditions, greater exposure to long-term care residence, and higher incarceration rates. COVID-19 also exposes African Americans' greater vulnerability to recession, and possibly greater susceptibility to accompanying behavioral health problems. If they are left unaddressed, the very vulnerabilities COVID-19 exploits may perpetuate themselves. However, continuing and supplementing health and economic COVID mitigation policies can disproportionately benefit African Americans and reduce short- and long-term adverse effects. The greater impact of COVID-19 on African Americans demonstrates the consequences of pervasive social and economic inequality and marks this as a critical time to prevent further compounding of adverse effects.","Snowden, Lonnie R; Graaf, Genevieve",J. racial ethnic health disparities (Internet),,344
410581,Editorial 2020,2020,"Introduction: Clinical presentations of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) vary among patients, which make a confusing challenge for clinicians to diagnose the disease. While the disease is not rare, but the symptoms may be atypical in children. Case Presentation: A 12-month-old boy with fever and rash without respiratory complaints at the onset of the disease presented to the hospital. His illness was then accompanied by severe anemia, hypoalbuminemia, hypoxemia, and pleural effusion. The nasopharyngeal swab polymerase chain reaction test was positive for the novel coronavirus. Despite primary normal lung imaging, the second imaging was typical for the disease on the third day of admission. Discussion: Dermatologic manifestations of the novel coronavirus infection are not rare during the illness but rarely occur at the onset of the disease. Information about the cutaneous manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 and its time interval from the onset of the disease in children are not clear yet. Severe anemia, hypoalbuminemia, and pleural effusion are not reported as classic findings of the novel SARS-CoV-2. They may be considered as a consequence of the hyperinflammatory response or direct effect of the virus. Conclusion: As a different manifestation of SARS-CoV-2, infected children may initially present fever and rash. More studies are needed to discover the cause of these complications. The correct answer may lead to better insight and more effective treatment.","Navaeifar, Mohammad Reza; Poudineh Ghazaghi, Mehrdad; Shahbaznejad, Leila; Rouhanizadeh, Hamed; Abutalebi, Mahnush; Ranjbar Varandi, Mobina; Rezai, Mohammad Sadegh",Int Med Case Rep J,,344
411412,Agent-based Simulation of Pedestrian Dynamics for Exposure Time Estimation in Epidemic Risk Assessment,2020-07-08,"Continuous glucose monitors (CGM) have demonstrated accuracy in outpatients and were accurate with pilot data using blinded systems in inpatients. Libre CGMs were approved and donated to hospitalsfor use during the COVID-19 to minimize exposure and PPE use. We made a prospective plan to assess accuracy of the Libre on inpatients admitted to COVID units during an initial “validation phase”. Fingerstick blood glucose (FSBG) was checked for the first three days after placing the sensor and compared to Libre values within the next 1–15 minutes. Patients were instructed to scan the sensor after each FSBG, and at other times as clinically warranted. FSBG values were recorded from the medical record (CPRS) and compared to Libre values downloaded to LibreView. The mean absolute relative difference (MARD) between FSBG and Libre was calculated for each patient for one to three days. The average MARD across all patients was calculated. Accuracy was further assessed using the Bland-Altman Plot and error grid analysis using web-based tool. Of the 21 patients assessed in the validation phase, 19 had at least one day of data and 11 had at least three days. The mean MARD was 11.2% after one day, and 12.5% after three days. Four patients after one day and three patients after three days had a MARD of 15–20% where use of the Libre was continued with confirmatory FSBG. In 15/19 (78%) patients with one day of data and 8/11 (73%) of patients with 3 days of data had a MARD &amp;lt;15% and continued using the Libre without further FSBG. One patient had a MARD &amp;gt;20% that did not improve with changing the sensor, and Libre was discontinued. In 16 of 19 patients, the Libre values were lower than FSBG. No adverse events relating to Libre use were identified. Error grid analysis showed that most patients had no values outside the A and B ranges, and very few values outside of the clinically accurate range, occurring in 2 of the 19 patients (9% of values in the “slight risk” zone in 9% in one and 6% in the other). The Libre was well-accepted by patient and nursing staff, but did not have measurable effect on glycemic control, hypoglycemic events, or hospitalization measures. The libre was deemed a useful intervention in inpatients, but it can be inaccurate or only moderately accurate compared to FSBG in enough patients to require checking accuracy for at least 1–3 days. Inaccurate Libre values were mostly lower than FSBG requiring confirmatory measures of low Libre values with FSBG in our experience.","Pandya, Reeni K.; Sukkari, Mohamad Anas Olson Darin E.",Journal of the Endocrine Society,,344
411497,Rationing and Disability in a State of Crisis,2020,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in a transformation of clinical care practices to protect both patients and providers. These changes led to a decrease in patient volume, impacting physician trainee education due to lost clinical and didactic opportunities. We measured the prevalence of trainee concern over missed educational opportunities and investigated the risk factors leading to such concerns. METHODS: All residents and fellows at a large academic medical center were invited to participate in a web-based survey in May of 2020. Participants responded to questions regarding demographic characteristics, specialty, primary assigned responsibility during the previous 2 weeks (clinical, education, or research), perceived concern over missed educational opportunities, and burnout. Multivariable logistic regression was used to assess the relationship between missed educational opportunities and the measured variables. RESULTS: 22% (301 of 1375) of the trainees completed the survey. 47% of the participants were concerned about missed educational opportunities. Trainees assigned to education at home had 2.85 [95%CI 1.33-6.45] greater odds of being concerned over missed educational opportunities as compared with trainees performing clinical work. Trainees performing research were not similarly affected [aOR = 0.96, 95%CI (0.47-1.93)]. Trainees in pathology or radiology had 2.51 [95%CI 1.16-5.68] greater odds of concern for missed educational opportunities as compared with medicine. Trainees with greater concern over missed opportunities were more likely to be experiencing burnout (p = 0.038). CONCLUSIONS: Trainees in radiology or pathology and those assigned to education at home were more likely to be concerned about their missed educational opportunities. Residency programs should consider providing trainees with research or at home clinical opportunities as an alternative to self-study should future need for reduced clinical hours arise.","Lou, Sunny S; Goss, Charles W; Evanoff, Bradley A; Duncan, Jennifer G; Kannampallil, Thomas",BMC Med Educ,,344

412772,A Research Agenda for the Future of Workplaces,2021,"The Covid-19 epidemic is an opportunity to underline how prison health on the African continent remains a weak link of the prison system. Beyond the difficulties in caring for Covid-19 in detention, prison infirmaries, where they exist, are rarely integrated into the health system in practice. Administrations provide little for the vital needs of prisoners. Dietary deficiencies are frequent, skin diseases recurrent and prisoners are most often dependent on the financial means of their families or NGOs when it comes to access to health care. The social illegitimacy of the prison population and the reluctance of States to offer convicted prisoners what they do not guarantee to the general population are two arguments put forward to justify what amounts to necropolitics. At the same time, international actors working in prisons essentially target pathologies with epidemic potential, constrained by funding sources (UNAIDS, Global Fund) supporting population-wide health strategies. Here we would like to return to these two logics and develop an argument for a decompartmentalized approach to prison health. Beyond the recognition of individual health experience and epidemiological concerns, addressing prison health globally contributes to the restoration of prisoners' dignity and rights by the State, a necessary condition for the maintenance of citizenship beyond confinement.","Le Marcis, Frédéric",Sante Publique,,344

414469,USC team develop accurate anti-spoofing,2020,"The preparticipation physical evaluation (PPE) is a common reason for young athletes to see a primary care physician. An annual PPE is required by most state high school athletic associations for participation in school-based sports, although there is limited evidence to support its effectiveness for detecting conditions that predispose athletes to injury or illness. In 2019, the American Academy of Pediatrics, with representatives from the American Academy of Family Physicians and other organizations, published updated PPE recommendations (PPE5). According to the guideline, the general goals of the PPE are determining general physical and psychological health;evaluating for life-threatening or disabling conditions, including risk of sudden cardiac arrest and other conditions that may predispose the athlete to illness or injury;and serving as an entry point into the health care system for those without a medical home or primary care physician. The guideline recommends that the evaluation take place in the physician's office rather than in a group setting. The PPE should include a structured physical examination that focuses on the cardiovascular, musculoskeletal, and neurologic systems. Screening for depression, anxiety disorders, and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder is also recommended. Clinicians should recognize any findings suggestive of the relative energy deficiency in sport syndrome. Additional consideration is required to address the needs and concerns of transgender athletes and athletes with physical and intellectual disabilities. Finally, guidelines have been published regarding return to play for athletes who have had COVID-19.","MacDonald, J.; Schaefer, M.; Stumph, J.",American Family Physician,,344

415929,News and Notices,2020,"OBJECTIVE: Information from critically ill coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients is limited and in many cases coming from health systems approaches different from the national public systems existing in most countries in Europe. Besides, patient follow-up remains incomplete in many publications. Our aim is to characterize acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) patients admitted to a medical critical care unit (MCCU) in a referral hospital in Spain. DESIGN: Retrospective case series of consecutive ARDS COVID-19 patients admitted and treated in our MCCU. SETTING: 36-bed MCCU in referral tertiary hospital. PATIENTS AND PARTICIPANTS: SARS-CoV-2 infection confirmed by real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay of nasal/pharyngeal swabs. INTERVENTIONS: None MAIN VARIABLES OF INTEREST: Demographic and clinical data were collected, including data on clinical management, respiratory failure, and patient mortality. RESULTS: Forty-four ARDS COVID-19 patients were included in the study. Median age was 61.50 (53.25 - 67) years and most of the patients were male (72.7%). Hypertension and dyslipidemia were the most frequent co-morbidities (52.3 and 36.4% respectively). Steroids (1mg/Kg/day) and tocilizumab were administered in almost all patients (95.5%). 77.3% of the patients needed invasive mechanical ventilation for a median of 16 days [11-28]. Prone position ventilation was performed in 33 patients (97%) for a median of 3 sessions [2-5] per patient. Nosocomial infection was diagnosed in 13 patients (29.5%). Tracheostomy was performed in ten patients (29.4%). At study closing all patients had been discharged from the CCU and only two (4.5%) remained in hospital ward. MCCU length of stay was 18 days [10-27]. Mortality at study closing was 20.5% (n 9); 26.5% among ventilated patients. CONCLUSIONS: The seven-week period in which our MCCU was exclusively dedicated to COVID-19 patients has been challenging. Despite the severity of the patients and the high need for invasive mechanical ventilation, mortality was 20.5%.","Ramírez, P; Gordón, M; Martín-Cerezuela, M; Villarreal, E; Sancho, E; Padrós, M; Frasquet, J; Leyva, G; Molina, I; Barrios, M; Gimeno, S; Castellanos, Á","Med. intensiva (Madr., Ed. impr.)",,344
416014,Coevolving Dynamics between Epidemic and Information Spreading considering the Dependence between Vigilance and Awareness Prevalence,2021,"BACKGROUND: Vaccination is an effective way to curtail the burden of COVID-19 in which success depends on a high acceptance of the vaccine. However, addressing concerns among vaccine-hesitant individuals is essential to avoid failure of the immunisation programme. This study sought to assess the concerns and acceptance rates regarding the COVID-19 vaccine among Malaysians. METHODS: An online questionnaire was distributed to 1411 respondents via a snowball sampling method among Malaysians aged 18 years and above. RESULTS: The majority of the respondents were young adults (40.7%), female (62.8%), Malay (63.8%), Muslim (72.3%), married (52.9%), with tertiary education (86.8%) and without medical illness (85%). Social media (97.4%) was the primary source of information regarding COVID-19. The overall acceptance rate was high (83.3%), with the lowest rates among the elderly aged 60 years and above (63.4%) and pensioners (64.6%). Hesitance was caused by concerns regarding side effects (95.8%), safety (84.7%), lack of information (80.9%), effectiveness (63.6%) and religious (20.8%) and cultural factors related to the COVID-19 vaccine (6.8%). Respondents with diabetes mellitus (24.7%) and hypercholesterolemia (23%) were more hesitant to accept the COVID-19 vaccine, at 16.1 and 15.8%, respectively. Predictors of COVID-19 vaccine hesitance were age, religion, and current residence. CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate a high rate of acceptance of the COVID-19 vaccine among Malaysians. Thus, the Malaysian government and other related agencies should increase their campaign and prepare to implement the COVID-19 mass immunisation programme among Malaysians. However, despite the high acceptance rate, it remains important to address concerns among hesitant individuals by building trust in vaccine safety and effectiveness through adequate information regarding the vaccine.","Syed Alwi, S A R; Rafidah, E; Zurraini, A; Juslina, O; Brohi, I B; Lukas, S",BMC Public Health,,344

Kai Zacharowski,2020,"Pathogen avoidance is an important motive underlying human behavior and is associated with numerous psychological processes-including biases against social groups heuristically associated with illness. Although there are reliable measurement scales to assess chronic dispositional levels of pathogen avoidance, no measurement scale currently exists to directly assess moment-to-moment fluctuations in pathogen avoidance. This paper presents the Situational Pathogen Avoidance (SPA) scale, which assesses situational variability in pathogen avoidance, especially as it pertains to avoidance of social stimuli. Across six studies, we demonstrate the reliability and validity of the SPA scale, show that the scale is influenced by situational activation of pathogen avoidance motives, and demonstrate that it mediates the association between pathogen avoidance motives (both chronic and situational) and social biases against obese and foreign targets. The SPA scale provides a valuable measurement tool for researchers who study pathogen avoidance and to those who study social biases more generally.","Makhanova, Anastasia; Plant, E Ashby; Maner, Jon K",Evol Psychol Sci,,344

This novel virus is thought to enter and cause infection in its host through the attachment of its structural protein known as the S-glycoprotein to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Given the rapid spread of COVID-19 with its consequences globally, it is mandatory that health caregivers and researchers across all disciplines abreast themselves with the potential effects that this novel virus may have on their fields and the medical society at large. During the infection, the cardiovascular system is affected by unknown pathomechanistic processes, hence accounting for an increased prevalence of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) among COVID-19 patients. As cardiovascular researchers, we are more concerned about the cardiovascular aspect of SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19. Hence, this concise review addresses these aspects where CVD as a risk factor of COVID-19, the prevalence of CVDs in COVID-19, and the potential cardiovascular disorders which may evolve owing to COVID-19 are discussed.

424631,Delaying COP26 is not a reason to delay climate action,2020,"Despite the efforts in the literature review on the traffic safety of children, the majority of past studies mainly focused only on the child's seatbelt status, or its position while ignoring other underlying factors that might contribute to the severity of those crashes. Inclusion of ther factors is especially important for a mountainous state like Wyoming with one of the highest rates of children's traffic fatality in the country. Thus, this study is conducted to fill the gap by identifying important factors contributing to the severity of crashes involving children. Here child is defined as any passengers under 9 years old. A first step in identifying factors to the severity of crashes involving children is implementing a reliable statistical method that could account for heterogeneity across various observations. So, in this study, to account for the heterogeneity in the dataset, the standard cumulative link model (CLM) was extended to the random effect model, while instead of assigning the subjective attribute for random effect, an objective hierarchy through the finite mixture modeling (FMM) was used. The FMM was employed in the context of the CLM to prevent the loss of information due to disaggregation of the dataset into the homogeneous datasets. The comparison results highlighted that the random effect model by the objective hierarchy would result in a significant improvement in the model fit compared with the standard cumulative link model. The results highlighted factors such as safety equipment in use, type of collision, and various drivers' characteristics and actions such as belting condition, alcohol and drug involvement are some of the factors contributing to the severity of child crashes. As expected, the main findings of our results highlighted that various drivers' actions and behaviors are the main causes that children would undergo a higher severity level in crashes. An extensive discussion regarding the implications of the results and the implemented statistical method were given in the context of the manuscript.","Rezapour, Mahdi; Ksaibati, Khaled",Int J Inj Contr Saf Promot,,344

This cross-sectional online survey study evaluated the menstrual cycle characteristics of women in the reproductive phase of their lives during the COVID-19 pandemic in May 2020. Changes before and after COVID-19 were evaluated with a paired sample t-test and chi-square test. A Pearson correlation test was used to show the relationships between variables. The study was completed with 263 participants in total. The average age of the participants was 26.3 ± 6.9 (18-45). Participants' duration of period (p = .003) and pads used per day (p = .002) decreased compared to their experience before the COVID-19 outbreak. The mean total MSQ score was 3.1 ± 0.8 (0-4), mean STAI-1 score was 45.1 ± 9 (20-78) and mean STAI-II score was 43.3 ± 5.9 (30-69). It was found that STAI-I and STAI-II scores showed a positive correlation with MSQ-Somatic subgroup scores(r = 0.153, p = .013; 0.190, p = .002) and MSQ-Total scores (0.144, p = .020; 0.175, p = .004). With the COVID-19 pandemic, increased anxiety scores increased women's menstrual symptoms while the length of periods and the number of pads used decreased.Impact statementWhat is already known on this subject? The COVID 19 pandemic, has caused enormous psychological distress potentially resulting in the development of posttraumatic stress disorder. The menstrual cycle is a process that can be affected by psychological stress.What do the results of this study add? This is the first study to examine the relationship between stress caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and the menstrual cycle. The increases in the degree of anxiety and stress as a result of the COVID-19 outbreak was found to be high enough to affect the characteristics of the menstrual cycle in the women surveyed.What are the implications of these findings for clinical practice and/or further research? In a prospective study intended to be carried out after the outbreak ends in the future, it will be possible to evaluate whether the menstrual cycle parameters return to their former order and consequently this hypothesis will be able to be more definitively confirmed.","Demir, Omer; Sal, Hidayet; Comba, Cihan",J Obstet Gynaecol,,344

The purpose of this article is to recommend emergency management procedures for dental clinics during this public health emergency. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We have implemented a series of emergency management measures to prevent cross-infection in our dental clinic during the COVID-19 pandemic, including personnel scheduling, division of the clinic into functional areas, limitation or delay of non-emergency patients, staff protection and infection controls, clinical environmental disinfection, and the use of online consultation services, among others. RESULTS: Due to public health policy and dental emergency management, the number of dental visitors to our clinic dropped sharply, and no COVID-19 suspected cases or high-risk patients received treatment. There have been no reports of infection of dental staff or patients during dental treatment in China to date. CONCLUSION: These public health policies and dental emergency management measures were effective in controlling cross-infection of COVID-19 in the dental clinic. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS: We share control measures for COVID-19, and hope that they will be helpful for dental professionals worldwide to continue to provide dental care in a safe and orderly manner.","Wang, Chao; Miao, Li; Wang, Zhigang; Xiong, Yanjie; Jiao, Yang; Liu, Hongchen",Int Dent J,,344

Therefore, clarifying the effects of this infection on the cardiovascular system is of importance in terms of the clinical course of the disease. The increases in cardiac and inflammatory biomarkers in COVID-19 have been associated with poor prognosis and mortality. However, there are no specific laboratory markers yet to assess the severity of the disease. In this context, the combination of available biomarkers is needed to better define the clinical course of this disease. Carbohydrate antigen 125 (CA-125) has become a remarkable marker in recent years as a result of the correlation of increasing levels in cardiovascular diseases with clinical, hemodynamic, echocardiographic parameters and its relation with mortality or re-hospitalization due to heart failure. These findings suggest that CA-125 might be useful biomarker to identify the damage mechanisms of COVID-19, monitoring the prognosis of the disease and the course of the treatment.","Dökümcü, Esra",Med Hypotheses,,344

432612,MedDialog: A Large-scale Medical Dialogue Dataset,2020-04-07,"As clinicians and support personnel struggle with their responsibilities to treat during the current COVID-19 pandemic, several ethical issues have emerged. Will healthcare workers and support staff fulfill their duty to treat in the face of high risks? Will institutional and government leaders at all levels do the right things to help alleviate healthcare workers risks and fears? Will physicians be willing to make hard, resource-allocation decisions if they cannot first husband or improvise alternatives?With our healthcare facilities and governments unprepared for this inevitable disaster, front-line doctors, advanced providers, nurses, EMS, and support personnel struggle with acute shortages of equipment-both to treat patients and protect themselves. With their personal and possibly their family's lives and health at risk, they must weigh the option of continuing to work or retreat to safety. This decision, made daily, is based on professional and personal values, how they perceive existing risks-including available protective measures, and their perception of the level and transparency of information they receive. Often, while clinicians get this information, support personnel do not, leading to absenteeism and deteriorating healthcare services. Leadership can use good risk communication (complete, widely transmitted, and transparent) to align healthcare workers' risk perceptions with reality. They also can address the common problems healthcare workers must overcome to continue working (ie, risk mitigation techniques). Physicians, if they cannot sufficiently husband or improvise lifesaving resources, will have to face difficult triage decisions. Ideally, they will use a predetermined plan, probably based on the principles of Utilitarianism (maximizing the greatest good) and derived from professional and community input. Unfortunately, none of these plans is optimal.","Iserson, Kenneth V",West J Emerg Med,,344

435673,A novel technique for automated concealed face detection in surveillance videos,2020,"Amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, handwashing offers a simple and effective hygienic measure for disease prevention. Reportedly, a significant proportion of college students did not follow handwashing recommendations provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in the pre-COVID era. The purpose of this cross-sectional study was to explore and explain the handwashing behavior among college students during the COVID-19 pandemic using a contemporary fourth-generation multi-theory model (MTM) of health behavior change. Data were collected from 713 college students at a large public university in the Southern U.S. in October 2020 using a validated 36-item survey. Statistical analyses included independent samples t-tests, Pearson correlation, and hierarchical regression modeling. Among students not following handwashing recommendations, the constructs of participatory dialogue (ß = 0.152; p < 0.05) and behavioral confidence (ß = 0.474; p < 0.0001) were statistically significant and accounted for 27.2% of the variance in the likelihood of initiation of the behavior. Additionally, the constructs of emotional transformation (ß = 0.330; p < 0.0001), practice for change (ß = 0.296; p < 0.0001), and changes in the social environment (ß = 0.180; p < 0.05) were statistically significant and accounted for 45.1% of the variance in the likelihood of sustaining handwashing behavior. This study highlights the applicability and usability of the MTM in designing and testing behavior change interventions and media messaging in campaigns targeting college students.","Sharma, Manoj; Batra, Kavita; Davis, Robert E; Wilkerson, Amanda H",,,344

More precisely we ask the question of how the epidemic outcomes are affected if the initial infection does not provide immunity but rather sensitization to future challenges. We first provide background comparison with the 2003 SARS epidemic. Then we use a compartmental epidemic model structured by immunity level that we fit to available data; using several scenarios of the fragilization dynamics, we derive quantitative insights into the additional expected numbers of severe cases and deaths.","Danchin, Antoine; Turinici, Gabriel",Math Biosci,,344
436324,Venture debt: a catalyst for Indian entrepreneurship,2020,"Globalization has brought not only advantages but also risks into the supply chains. One lesser studied risk is the effect of consumer behavior in crises. The recent COVID-19 pandemic has shown that the most efficient and optimized supply chains are susceptible to consumer panic buying. There is a severe need to understand the multitude of scenarios that could manifest after a catastrophe due to the change in consumer behavior so that businesses can develop a mitigation plan. The authors have developed an agent-based model that can simulate the various outcomes of a crisis using a consumer panic buying model and a supply chain model. The model quantitatively evaluates the panic purchase intention of a consumer while assessing the impact of panic buying on the supply chain. This paper introduces the implementation of the model, focusing on output analysis of the various situational settings in disaster aftermath. Preliminary study has revealed that implementing quota policy or rationing uniformly is very effective while controlling media reports or panic buying consumers can reduce consumer demand significantly. © 2021 by the authors.

436657,A new era for Chinese military logistics,2021,"During an epidemic, almost all healthcare facilities restrict the visiting of patients to prevent disease transmission. For hospices with terminally ill patients, the trade-off between compassion and infection control becomes a difficult decision. This study aimed to survey the changes in visiting policy for all 76 hospice wards in Taiwan during the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020. The altered visiting policies were assessed by the number of visitors per patient allowed at one time, the daily number of visiting slots, the number of hours open daily, and requisites for hospice ward entry. The differences in visiting policies between hospice wards and ordinary wards were also investigated. Data were collected by reviewing the official website of each hospital and were supplemented by phone calls in cases where no information was posted on the website. One quarter (n = 20) of hospice wards had different visiting policies to those of ordinary wards in the same hospital. Only one hospice ward operated an open policy, and in contrast, nine (11.8%) stopped visits entirely. Among the 67 hospice wards that allowed visiting, at most, two visitors at one time per patient were allowed in 46 (68.6%), one visiting time daily was allowed in 32 (47.8%), one hour of visiting per day was allowed in 29 (43.3%), and checking of identity and travel history was carried out in 12 wards (17.9%). During the COVID-19 pandemic, nearly all hospice wards in Taiwan changed their visiting policies, but the degree of restriction varied. Further studies could measure the impacts of visiting policy changes on patients and healthcare professionals.","Hsu, Ya-Chuan; Liu, Ya-An; Lin, Ming-Hwai; Lee, Hsiao-Wen; Chen, Tzeng-Ji; Chou, Li-Fang; Hwang, Shinn-Jang",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,344

The purpose of the study was to examine whether online learning is merely a short-term temporary solution necessitated by the COVID-19 crisis, or will it enable a transformation of teaching and learning patterns in educational systems in the post-COVID era? What is students' personal preference regarding online learning after having inadvertently experienced it? What dimension of online teaching was meaningful for them: social presence, instructional-cognitive presence, emotional-personal presence? The research population consisted of 306 students, with a mean age of 15.5. Only 85% of the students who participated in the study had technological resources for online learning at home. About 41% of the students preferred lessons that combine online teaching with frontal teaching in the classroom. In addition, the dimensions of online teaching reported by students as meaningful were, in descending order, social presence (M = 3.54), emotional-personal presence (M = 2.96), and instructional-cognitive presence (M = 2.73). The research findings might have an effect on policy makers in education with regard to maintaining an ""innovative pedagogy"" aimed at shaping students' image in order to prepare them for the new post-COVID era. In this period of global crisis, online learning afforded students innovative learning, where students enhanced their awareness of the significance of social presence, which was more meaningful than the dimension of instructional-cognitive presence. The significance of interpersonal interaction in teaching and learning received support, more so than ever before.","Ben-Amram, Miri Davidovitch Nitza",Journal of Education and Learning,,344
436849,Japan,2020,"COVID 19 disease has become a global catastrophe over the past year that has claimed the lives of over two million people around the world. Despite the introduction of vaccines against the disease, there is still a long way to completely eradicate it. There are concerns about the complications following infection with SARS-CoV-2. This research aimed to evaluate the possible correlation between infection with SARS-CoV viruses and cancer in an in-silico study model. To do this, the relevent dataset was selected from GEO database. Identification of differentially expressed genes among defined groups including SARS-CoV, SARS-dORF6, SARS-BatSRBD, and H1N1 were screened where the |Log FC| &#8805; 1and p < 0.05 were considered statistically significant. Later, the pathway enrichment analysis and gene ontology (GO) were used by Enrichr and Shiny GO databases. Evaluation with STRING online was applied to predict the functional interactions of proteins, followed by Cytoscape analysis to identify the master genes. Finally, analysis with GEPIA2 server was carried out to reveal the possible correlation between candidate genes and cancer development. The results showed that the main molecular function of up- and down-regulated genes was ""double-stranded RNA binding"" and actin-binding, respectively. STRING and Cytoscape analysis presented four genes, PTEN, CREB1, CASP3, and SMAD3 as the key genes involved in cancer development. According to TCGA database results, these four genes were up-regulated notably in pancreatic adenocarcinoma. Our findings suggest that pancreatic adenocarcinoma is the most probably malignancy happening after infection with SARS-CoV family.","Ebrahimi Sadrabadi, Amin; Bereimipour, Ahmad; Jalili, Arsalan; Gholipurmalekabadi, Mazaher; Farhadihosseinabadi, Behrouz; Seifalian, Alexander M",Sci Rep,,344

437415,A Longitudinal Multi-modal Dataset for Dementia Monitoring and Diagnosis,2021-09-03,"According to the latest Newcastle disease virus (NDV) classification system, Iranian PPMV-1 isolates were classified as either XXI.1.1 or XXI.2 subgenotypes only. However, a few recent studies have suggested the possible existence of other Iranian PPMV-1 genotypes/subgenotypes. Recently, we isolated a PPMV-1 closely related to the African origin subgenotype VI.2.1.2 from an ill captive pigeon in a park aviary in central Tehran (Pg/IR/AMMM160/2019). This subgenotype had never been reported from Iran or neighboring countries. We also isolated a subgenotype VII.1.1 NDV (Pg/IR/AMMM117/2018), usually reported from non-pigeon birds in Iran. The nucleotide distance of AMMM117 was 1.0-2.5% compared to other Iranian subgenotypes VII.1.1 isolates. However, usually the same year VII.1.1 viruses that we isolate from Iranian poultry farms show negligible distances (0.0-0.5%). More isolates are required to study if this difference is due to subgenotype VII.1.1 being circulated and mutated in pigeons. Here, we also characterized two other isolates, namely Pg/IR/AMMM168/2019 and Pg/IR/MAM39/2017. The latter is the first Iranian subgenotype XXI.1.1 to be featured in the NDV datasets of the international NDV consortium. We also investigated the phylogenetic relation of all the published Iranian pigeon-derived NDV to date and updated the grouping according to the latest classification system. We have concluded that at least six different groups of pigeon-derived NDV have been circulating in Iran since 1996, four of which have been reported from just one city over the last seven years. This study suggests that the Iranian pigeon-origin NDV have been more diverse than the Iranian poultry-derived NDV in recent years.","Molouki, Aidin; Soltani, Mohammad; Akhijahani, Mohsen Mahmoudzadeh; Merhabadi, Mohammad Hossein Fallah; Abtin, Alireza; Shoushtari, Abdelhamid; Langeroudi, Arash Ghalyanchi; Lim, Swee Hua Erin; Allahyari, Esmaeel; Abdoshah, Mohammad; Pourbakhsh, Seyed Ali",Curr Microbiol,,344
437927,Semiparametric inference for the scale-mixture of normal partial linear regression model with censored data,2020-11-15,"INTRODUCTION: Scientific societies recommend screening for SARS-CoV-2 in patients prior to endoscopy. There is no solid evidence regarding the efficiency of universal screening by PCR test for SARS-CoV-2. The present study aimed to assess the usefulness of clinical screening and universal pre-procedure PCR testing for the identification of patients capable of transmitting the SARS-CoV-2 infection. Concordance between both strategies was also evaluated. METHOD: A retrospective review was conducted in a consecutive cohort of patients undergoing endoscopy at a tertiary teaching hospital between 22nd April and 22nd June 2020, following a screening protocol. RESULTS: Three hundred and sixty-one patients were included. Clinical screening detected 13 patients with a high risk of infection (3.6%, 95% CI 2.62-4.58) while the pre-procedure PCR test was positive in five patients (1.40% 95% CI 0.20-2.60). Three patients developed COVID-19 and one died from the disease. Agreement between both strategies was poor, with a Kappa value of 0.093 (95% CI 0.001-0.185). Clinical screening only identified one of the five patients with a positive PCR test. CONCLUSION: Clinical screening prior to endoscopy presents poor agreement with the pre-procedure PCR test.","Khorrami Minaei, Sam; Garrido Durán, Carmen; García Hernández, Marcelo; García Amengual, Irene; Mena Ribas, Ana",Rev. esp. enferm. dig,,344

In Spain, 68% of all coronavirus hospitalizations correspond to those over 60 years of age. This work aims to highlight the evidence about the measures to be implemented through current and future guidelines. The need to prepare for action by implementing international protocols stand out. There is a trend towards biopsychosocial care of elderly people in all settings where they are, adapting care and personalizing decisions on hospital admissions, palliative care, among other criteria, to years adjusted to quality of life, as well as alternatives for monitoring and treatment of COVID-19 pathology and others existing in this population group. Measures to reduce the transmission of the virus through hygiene and social distancing are necessary, attending to biopsychosocial health of the elderly isolated. Intersectoral communication is proposed as innovative alternatives, and the use of technological tools, accompanied by adequate digital health literacy. Future lines focus on guaranteeing social and health rights, equating the social and health system at the same level, and achieving real coordination. A new framework of person-centered care could be a great ally to achieve integrated care for the elderly, guided by an increase in resources bound to funding longevity research projects.","Gálvez, Ana Mª Porcel; Romero, Bárbara Badanta; Trigo, Sergio Barrientos; Serrano, Marta Lima",Enferm. clin.

This study aimed to understand video visit adoption by plastic surgery providers; and patient and surgeon perceptions about its efficacy, value, accessibility, and long-term viability. A secondary aim was to develop the proposed 'Triage Tool for Video Visits in Plastic Surgery' to help determine visit video eligibility. METHODS: This mixed-methods evaluation assessed provider-level scheduling data from the Division of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery at Stanford Health Care to quantify telemedicine adoption and semi-structured phone interviews with patients (n = 20) and surgeons (n = 10) to explore stakeholder perspectives on video visits. RESULTS: During the 13-week period after the local stay-at-home orders due to coronavirus disease 2019, 21.4% of preoperative visits and 45.5% of postoperative visits were performed via video. Video visits were considered acceptable by patients and surgeons in plastic surgery in terms of quality of care but were limited by the inability to perform a physical examination. Interviewed clinicians reported that long-term viability needs to be centered around technology (eg, connection, video quality, etc) and physical examinations. Our findings informed a proposed triage tool to determine the appropriateness of video visits for individual patients that incorporates visit type, anesthesia, case, surgeon's role, and patient characteristics. CONCLUSION: Video technology has the potential to facilitate and improve preoperative and postoperative patient care in plastic surgery but the following components are needed: patient education on taking high-quality photos; standardized clinical guidelines for conducting video visits; and an algorithm-assisted triage tool to support scheduling.","Brown-Johnson, Cati G; Spargo, Tavish; Kling, Samantha M R; Saliba-Gustafsson, Erika A; Lestoquoy, Anna Sophia; Garvert, Donn W; Vilendrer, Stacie; Winget, Marcy; Asch, Steven M; Maggio, Paul; Nazerali, Rahim S",Surgery (St. Louis),,344

446305,Towards Diversity in Global Journalism Studies. A Reply to Seth C. Lewis,2021,"BackgroundThe COVID-19 pandemic created the need for very large scale, rapid testing to prevent and contain transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Lateral flow device (LFD) immunoassays meet this need by indicating the presence of SARS-CoV-2 antigen from nose/throat swab washings in 30 minutes without laboratory processing, and can be manufactured quickly at low cost. Since March 2021, UK schools have asked pupils without symptoms to test twice weekly. Pupils have posted on social media about using soft drinks to create positive results. The aim of this study was to systematically test a variety soft drinks to determine whether they can cause false ""false positive"" LFD results. MethodsThis study used 14 soft drinks and 4 artificial sweeteners to determine the outcome of misusing them as analyte for the Innova SARS-CoV-2 antigen rapid qualitative LFD. The pH value, sugar content and ingredients of each sample are described. The LFD results were double read and a subset was repeated using the same devices and fake analytes but differently sourced. FindingsOne sample (1/14; 7%), spring water, produced a negative result. Ten drinks (10/14; 71%) produced a positive or weakly positive result. Three samples (3/14; 21%) produced void results, mostly the fruit concentrate drinks. There was no apparent correlation between the pH value (pH 5.0 in 13/14, 93%; pH 6.5 in 1/14; 7%) or the sugar content (range 0-10.7 grams per 100mls) of the drinks and their LFD result. The 4 artificial sweeteners all produced negative results. A subset of the results was fully replicated with differently sourced materials. InterpretationSeveral soft drinks can be misused to give false positive SARS-CoV-2 LFD results.

When these professionals have experienced suffering and psychological depletion, they have been held accountable for this suffering, adopting an individualistic and reductionist viewpoint focused only on the professional. This approach has become obsolete due to its proven ineffectiveness, especially from an ethics of responsibility and organization viewpoint. CONTEXT: The psychological well-being of the healthcare worker (and its opposites: suffering, exhaustion, and disenchantment) is advantageous to the professional's commitment to the institution, to their work performance, and to their personal life. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this paper is to reflect on the psychological suffering of the palliative care professional. METHOD: We will reflect on the three levels of responsibility that influence such suffering (micro-meso-macro-ethical; worker-environment-institution). RESULTS: We will propose a global strategy for the care of psychological well-being supported by scientific evidence and key references.

Accurate measurement of physical activity in free-living environment is important in evaluating physical activity interventions. RESEARCH QUESTION: What is the criterion validity of 1)an ActiGraph to identify physical activity at different intensity levels and 2)an ActiGraph and a smartphone to measure step rate? METHODS: Community-dwelling older people aged&#8805;60 were recruited. The index tests were using ActiGraph worn in different positions (i.e.,both wrists and hip) to measure physical activity intensity and step rate and using smartphone (i.e., Samsung J2 pro and Google Fit) worn in different positions (i.e.,trousers pocket and waist pouch) to measure the step rate. The reference standards were using indirect calorimetry (i.e.,CosMedK4b 2) to measure physical activity intensity and using direct observation for step rate. Subjects were exposed in different physical activity intensity levels (i.e.,sedentary:MET < 1.5,light: MET = 1.5-2.99, moderate:MET = 3.0-6.0, vigorous:MET>6) and step rates through walking on a treadmill at different speeds (i.e.,2-8 km) for approximately 30 min. Spearman's rho, ROC analysis, and percentage error were employed to report the criterion validity. RESULTS: 31 participants completed the tests. ActiGraphs worn in different body positions could significantly differentiate physical activity intensity at the levels of ""light- or-above"" (VM cut-off = 279.5-1959.1,AUC = 0.932-0.954), ""moderate-or-above"" (VM cut- off = 1051.0-4212.9,AUC = 0.918-0.932), and ""vigorous"" (VM cut-off = 3335.4-5093.0, AUC = 0.890-0.907) well with different cut-off points identified. The step rate measured by direct observation correlated significantly with ActiGraph and smartphone (rho = 0.415-0.791). Both ActiGraph and smartphone at different positions generally underestimated the step rate (%error= -20.5,-30.3). SIGNIFICANCE: A wrist-worn ActiGraph can accurately identify different physical activity intensity levels in older people, but lower cut-off points in older people should be adopted. To measure step rate, a hip-mounted ActiGraph is preferable than a wrist- worn one. A smartphone employing Google Fit generally underestimates step rate but it gives a relatively more accurate estimation of step rate when the older people walk at a speed of 4-8 km/h.","Kwan, Rick Yiu Cho; Liu, Justina Yat Wa; Lee, Deborah; Tse, Choi Yeung Andy; Lee, Paul Hong",Gait Posture,,344

In this study, we propose a simple model of IDPs as associative polymers in poor solvent and explore the formation of transient liquid droplets and their transformation into solid-like aggregates. We use Langevin dynamics simulations of short polymers with two stickers placed symmetrically along their contour to study the effect of the primary sequence of these polymers on their organization inside condensed droplets. We observe that the shape, size, and number of sticker clusters inside the droplet change from a long cylindrical fiber to many compact clusters as one varies the location of stickers along the chain contour. Aging caused by the conversion of intramoleclular to intermolecular associations is observed in droplets of telechelic polymers but not for other sequences of associating polymers. The relevance of our results to condensates of IDPs is discussed.","Singh, Kulveer; Rabin, Yitzhak",Biophys. j,,344
450405,A Statistical Examination of Distinct Characteristics Influencing the Performance of Vector-Borne Epidemiological Agent-Based Simulation Models,2021,"PURPOSE: The COVID-19 pandemic significantly disrupted cancer care in Africa, further exposing major health disparities. This paper compares and contrasts the experiences of 15 clinicians in six different African cancer centers to highlight the positive aspects (silver linings) in an otherwise negative situation. METHODS: Data are from personal experience of the clinicians working at the six cancer centers blended with what is available in the literature. RESULTS: The impact of COVID-19 on cancer care appeared to vary not only across the continent but also over cancer centers. Different factors such as clinic location, services offered, available resources, and level of restrictions imposed because of COVID-19 were associated with these variations. Collectively, delays in treatment and limited access to cancer care were commonly reported in the different regions. CONCLUSION: There is a lack of data on cancer patients with COVID-19 and online COVID-19 and cancer registries for Africa. Analysis of the available data, however, suggests a higher mortality rate for cancer patients with COVID-19 compared with those without cancer. Positive or silver linings coming out of the pandemic include the adoption of hypofractionated radiation therapy and teleoncology to enhance access to care while protecting patients and staff members. Increasing collaborations using online technology with oncology health professionals across the world are also being seen as a silver lining, with valuable sharing of experiences and expertise to improve care, enhance learning, and reduce disparities. Advanced information and communication technologies are seen as vital for such collaborations and could avail efforts in dealing with the ongoing pandemic and potential future crises.","Grossheim, Linda; Ruff, Paul; Ngoma, Twalib; Vanderpuye, Verna; Mwango, Gladys; Ochieng, Primus; Palmer, Dennis; Kouya, Francine; Lasebikan, Nwamaka; Ntekim, Atara; Ngoma, Mamsau; Bih, Noella; Malloum, Abba; Elzawawy, Ahmed; Kerr, David; Ngwa, Wilfred",JCO Glob Oncol,,344

It is, therefore, an immediate priority to monitor rates of mood, sleep and other mental health issues in order to understand mediating factors and inform tailored interventions. The aim of this review is to synthesize and analyze existing evidence on the prevalence of depression, anxiety and insomnia among HCWs during the Covid-19 outbreak. METHODS: A systematic search of literature databases was conducted up to April 17th, 2020. Two reviewers independently assessed full-text articles according to predefined criteria. Risk of bias for each individual study was assessed and data pooled using random-effects meta-analyses to estimate the prevalence of specific mental health problems. The review protocol is registered in PROSPERO and is available online. FINDINGS: Thirteen studies were included in the analysis with a combined total of 33,062 participants. Anxiety was assessed in 12 studies, with a pooled prevalence of 23·2% and depression in 10 studies, with a prevalence rate of 22·8%. A subgroup analysis revealed gender and occupational differences with female HCPs and nurses exhibiting higher rates of affective symptoms compared to male and medical staff respectively. Finally, insomnia prevalence was estimated at 38·9% across 5 studies. INTERPRETATION: Early evidence suggests that a considerable proportion of HCWs experience mood and sleep disturbances during this outbreak, stressing the need to establish ways to mitigate mental health risks and adjust interventions under pandemic conditions.","Pappa, Sofia; Ntella, Vasiliki; Giannakas, Timoleon; Giannakoulis, Vassilis G; Papoutsi, Eleni; Katsaounou, Paraskevi",Brain Behav Immun,,344

453773,Caring in wards without water,2021,"Cough from a cardiologic perspective Abstract. A cough is at the efferent end of a complex reflex arc and, due to its well-known mechanical respiratory cleaning function, usually the first symptom prompting a pneumological clarification. However, the chemical and mechanical afferent neuronal parts of the reflex, the cough receptors, are distributed over a variety of organ systems, some of which directly and indirectly affect the heart. Cardiology therefore plays a central role in the clarification of coughs. In cardiology, a cough is most frequently caused by acute and chronic heart failure resulting from different types of cardiomyopathies. It can, however, be caused by other pathologies as well. The connection between cough and cardiac arrhythmia is interesting, although cough can be cause, consequence and therapy. Last but not least, almost all drugs frequently prescribed in cardiology can cause cough in one way or another. In addition, a cough is the current number 1 warning sign when it comes to COVID-19 infection. On the one hand, it must be differentiated from cardiac-induced coughs, but on the other hand it can also be closely related to them.","Pavlicek-Bahlo, Maryam; Hunziker, Lukas",Ther Umsch,,344

We conducted a systematic review of randomized clinical trials assessing treatment with remdesivir, chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir, ritonavir, dexamethasone, and convalescent plasma, for hospitalized patients with a diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The outcomes were mortality, clinical improvement, duration of ventilation, duration of oxygen support, duration of hospitalization, virological clearance, and severe adverse events. A total of 48 studies were retrieved from the databases. Eleven articles were finally included in the data extraction and qualitative synthesis of results. The meta-analysis suggests a benefit of dexamethasone versus standard care in the reduction of risk of mortality at day 28; and the clinical improvement at days 14 and 28 in patients treated with remdesivir. We can conclude that dexamethasone would have a better result in hospitalized patients, especially in low-resources settings. The analysis of the main treatments proposed for hospitalized patients is of vital importance to reduce mortality in low-income countries, since the COVID-19 pandemic had an economic impact worldwide with the loss of jobs and economic decline in countries with scarce resources.The reviews of this paper are available via the supplemental material section.","Abeldaño Zuñiga, Roberto Ariel; Coca, Silvia Mercedes; Abeldaño, Giuliana Florencia; González-Villoria, Ruth Ana María",Ther Adv Respir Dis,,344

Particular attention is drawn to epidemic spreading at time-varying transition rates. A time-varying SIR-like model is used to describe the epidemic dynamics, from which closed equations relating parameters and key quantities like reproduction ratio and doubling time are derived. The definition and computation of these metrics are revisited in the context of the general solution to the time-varying model dynamics, focusing on the similarities and differences with the time-invariant case. Further, the prediction of these metrics, that is of the disease evolution, as response to different scenarios is also investigated.","Battista, Hern'an De; Garc'ia-Cl'ua, Jos'e; Nunez, Sebasti'an; Inthamoussou, Fernando; Ingenier'ia, Fabricio Garelli Grupo de Control Aplicado GCA-LEICI.

460417,The Discourses of Environmental Collapse: Imagining the End,2021,"BACKGROUND: The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) epidemic has been emerged as a cardinal public health problem. Children have their own specific clinical features; notably, they seem to be escaping the severe respiratory adverse effects. The international scientific community is rapidly carrying out studies, driving to the need to reassess knowledge of the disease and therapeutic strategies. AIM: To assess the characteristics of COVID-19 infected children worldwide of all ages, from neonates to children and adolescents, and how they differ from their adult counterparts. SEARCH STRATEGY: An electronic search in PubMed was conducted, using combinations of the following keywords: coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, COVID-19, children. The search included all types of articles written in English between January 1, 2019 until August 15, 2020. RESULTS: The search identified 266 relevant articles. Children were mainly within family clusters of cases and have relatively milder clinical presentation compared with adults; children were reported to have better outcomes with a significantly lower mortality rate. Cough and fever were the most common symptoms while pneumonia was the cardinal respiratory manifestation of infected children. Laboratory results and thoracic imaging give varying results. CONCLUSIONS: Children were mainly family cluster cases and usually presented with a mild infection, although cases presented with the multisystem inflammatory syndrome are becoming more apparent. Studies determining why the manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 infection are so variable may help to gain a better understanding of the disease and accelerate the development of vaccines and therapies.","Perikleous, Evanthia; Tsalkidis, Aggelos; Bush, Andrew; Paraskakis, Emmanouil",Pediatr Pulmonol,,344

Here we have proven that newly synthesized chiral naphthalene diimide (NDI) derivatives are excellent electroactive materials for TD enantiosensors. The recognition process relies on the specific interaction between the chiral NDI receptor and the thalidomide enantiomer of the opposite configuration. This unique specific interaction between (S)-thalidomide and (R)-NDI derivative counterparts, evident in the DPV voltammograms, was confirmed by molecular modeling. The demonstrated voltammetric enantiosensors are characterized by the low detection limit at the level of µg·L-1, wide analytical range from 5·10-4 - 10 mg·L-1, high selectivity and long lifetime. The results of the recovery rates showed a very good degree of accuracy towards the determination of (S)-thalidomide in the blood samples, so it can be successfully used in the analysis of clinical samples.","Kowalczyk, Agata; Lipinski, Piotr F J; Karon, Krzysztof; Rode, Joanna E; Lyczko, Krzysztof; Dobrowolski, Jan Cz; Donten, Mikolaj; Kaczorek, Dorota; Poszytek, Joanna; Kawecki, Robert; Lapkowski, Mieczyslaw; Malkowska, Anna; Grudzinski, Ireneusz P; Nowicka, Anna M",Biosens Bioelectron,,344

Identification of clinical phenotypes may facilitate tailored therapy and improve outcomes. The purpose of this study is to identify specific clinical phenotypes across COVID-19 patients and compare admission characteristics and outcomes. METHODS: This is a retrospective analysis of COVID-19 patients from March 7, 2020 to August 25, 2020 at 14 U.S. hospitals. Ensemble clustering was performed on 33 variables collected within 72 hours of admission. Principal component analysis was performed to visualize variable contributions to clustering. Multinomial regression models were fit to compare patient comorbidities across phenotypes. Multivariable models were fit to estimate associations between phenotype and in-hospital complications and clinical outcomes. RESULTS: The database included 1,022 hospitalized patients with COVID-19. Three clinical phenotypes were identified (I, II, III), with 236 [23.1%] patients in phenotype I, 613 [60%] patients in phenotype II, and 173 [16.9%] patients in phenotype III. Patients with respiratory comorbidities were most commonly phenotype III (p = 0.002), while patients with hematologic, renal, and cardiac (all p<0.001) comorbidities were most commonly phenotype I. Adjusted odds of respiratory, renal, hepatic, metabolic (all p<0.001), and hematological (p = 0.02) complications were highest for phenotype I. Phenotypes I and II were associated with 7.30-fold (HR:7.30, 95% CI:(3.11-17.17), p<0.001) and 2.57-fold (HR:2.57, 95% CI:(1.10-6.00), p = 0.03) increases in hazard of death relative to phenotype III. CONCLUSION: We identified three clinical COVID-19 phenotypes, reflecting patient populations with different comorbidities, complications, and clinical outcomes.

We performed a retrospective study of patients 18 years of age and under admitted to four New York hospitals in the Northwell Health System interned during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, between March 9 and August 13, 2020. Acute kidney injury was defined and staged according to Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes criteria. The cohort included 152 patients; 97 acute-COVID-19 and 55 with MIS-C associated with COVID-19. Acute kidney injury occurred in 8 with acute-COVID-19 and in 10 with MIS-C. Acute kidney injury, in unadjusted models, was associated with a lower serum albumin level (odds ratio 0.17; 95% confidence interval 0.07, 0.39) and higher white blood cell counts (odds ratio 1.11; 95% confidence interval 1.04, 1.2). Patients with MIS-C and acute kidney injury had significantly greater rates of systolic dysfunction, compared to those without (80% vs 49%). In unadjusted models, patients with acute kidney injury had 8.4 days longer hospitalizations compared to patients without acute kidney injury (95% confidence interval, 4.4-6.7). Acute kidney injury in acute-COVID-19 and MIS-C may be related to inflammation and/or dehydration.

464109,Heterogeneous consumer preferences for local community involvement in nature‐based tourism drive triple‐bottom‐line gains,2021,"In the late 1990s, an estimated 75% of pregnant women in Nepal were anaemic. Although iron and folic acid (IFA) supplements were available free of charge, coverage among pregnant women was very low. In response, the Government of Nepal launched the Iron Intensification Programme (IIP) in 2003 to improve the coverage of IFA supplementation and anthelminthic treatment during pregnancy, as well as promote the utilization of antenatal care. This review examined how the IIP programme contributed to Nepal's success in increasing the consumption of IFA supplements during pregnancy. Nepal's cadre of Female Community Health Volunteers were engaged in the IIP to support the community-based distribution of IFA supplements to pregnant women and complement IFA distribution through health facilities and outreach services. As a result, the country achieved a fourfold increase in the proportion of women who took IFA supplements during pregnancy between 2001 and 2016 (from 23% to 91%) and a 12-fold increase in the proportion who took IFA supplements for at least 90 days during pregnancy (from 6% to 71%). The increase in coverage of IFA supplements accompanied an increase in the coverage of antenatal care during the same period. By 2016, the prevalence of anaemia in pregnant women decreased to 46%, highlighting the need to tackle other causes of anaemia and improve haemoglobin concentration before pregnancy, while maintaining the successful efforts to reach pregnant women with IFA supplements at the community level.","Paudyal, Naveen; Parajuli, Kedar Raj; Garcia Larsen, Vanessa; Adhikari, Ramesh Kant; Devkota, Madhu Dixit; Rijal, Sanjay; Chitekwe, Stanley; Torlesse, Harriet",Matern Child Nutr,,344

There is also a critical need to develop interventions to prevent the complications of COVID-19, which occur with an alarming frequency in older adults. Since severe pathologic effects of infection occur with increasing age, COVID-19 falls under the geroscience concept that all diseases in older adults have a common and major underlying cause of declining function and resilience. Geroscience posits that manipulation of aging will simultaneously delay the appearance or severity of major diseases because they share the same risk factor: aging and the multiple processes involved in aging. Drug combinations that target multiple aging processes and the cytokine networks associated with them would not necessarily limit SARS-CoV-2 infection rates but would prevent severe pathologic consequences of the disease in older adults by maintaining a more youthful-like resilience to infection-related complications. A drug cocktail aimed at controlling cytokine actions would complement current clinical treatments and vaccine effectiveness for COVID-19 and serve as a prototype for future age-related infectious disease pandemics wherein the elderly population is especially vulnerable.","Dou, Yan; Fatemi, Soroosh; Darvas, Martin; Gale, Michael; Ladiges, Warren",J Interferon Cytokine Res,,344
465833,"Blacks weather, Whites climate",2021,"BACKGROUND: Globally, primary care changed dramatically as a result of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. We aimed to understand the degree to which office and virtual primary care changed, and for which patients and physicians, during the initial months of the pandemic in Ontario, Canada. METHODS: This population-based study compared comprehensive, linked primary care physician billing data from Jan. 1 to July 28, 2020, with the same period in 2019. We identified Ontario residents with at least 1 office or virtual (telephone or video) visit during the study period. We compared trends in total physician visits, office visits and virtual visits before COVID-19 with trends after pandemic-related public health measures changed the delivery of care, according to various patient and physician characteristics. We used interrupted time series analysis to compare trends in the early and later halves of the COVID-19 period. RESULTS: Compared with 2019, total primary care visits between March and July 2020 decreased by 28.0%, from 7.66 to 5.51 per 1000 people/day. The smallest declines were among patients with the highest expected health care use (8.3%), those who could not be attributed to a primary care physician (10.2%), and older adults (19.1%). In contrast, total visits in rural areas increased by 6.4%. Office visits declined by 79.1% and virtual care increased 56-fold, comprising 71.1% of primary care physician visits. The lowest uptake of virtual care was among children (57.6%), rural residents (60.6%) and physicians with panels of &#8805; 2500 patients (66.0%). INTERPRETATION: Primary care in Ontario saw large shifts from office to virtual care over the first 4 months of the COVID-19 pandemic. Total visits declined least among those with higher health care needs. The determinants and consequences of these major shifts in care require further study.","Glazier, Richard H; Green, Michael E; Wu, Fangyun C; Frymire, Eliot; Kopp, Alexander; Kiran, Tara",CMAJ,,344

We successfully modified a desalt-type reaction using allyl ester or halide to a dehydrative one using allylic alcohol via the establishment of two redox-mediated donor acceptor bifunctional catalyst systems. These systems were cationic CpRu-Cl-Napy-PyCOOH and cationic CpRu-Naph-diPIM-dioxo-iPr/p-TsOH and were designed on the basis of the soft ruthenium and hard Brønsted acid combined catalyst concept. The complementary use of the two chiral catalysts for dehydrative asymmetric allylation expands the application scope facilitating the utilization of both aliphatic and aromatic allylic alcohols with various nucleophiles in the substrate. In this account, the design, synthesis, and application of these catalysts were reported.","Tanaka, Shinji; Kitamura, Masato",Chem Rec,,344
469533,Antibacterial drugs for community-acquired pneumonia,2021,"Model deficiency that results from incomplete training data is a form of structural blindness that leads to costly errors, oftentimes with high confidence. During the training of classification tasks, underrepresented class-conditional distributions that a given hypothesis space can recognize results in a mismatch between the model and the target space. To mitigate the consequences of this discrepancy, we propose Random Test Sampling and Cross-Validation (RTSCV) as a general algorithmic framework that aims to perform a post-training model rectification at deployment time in a supervised way. RTSCV extracts unknown unknowns (u.u.s), i.e., examples from the class-conditional distributions that a classifier is oblivious to, and works in combination with a diverse family of modern prediction models. RTSCV augments the training set with a sample of the test set (or deployment data) and uses this redefined class layout to discover u.u.s via cross-validation, without relying on active learning or budgeted queries to an oracle. We contribute a theoretical analysis that establishes performance guarantees based on the design bases of modern classifiers. Our experimental evaluation demonstrates RTSCV's effectiveness, using 7 benchmark tabular and computer vision datasets, by reducing a performance gap as large as 41% from the respective pre-rectification models. Last we show that RTSCV consistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches.","Abrahao, Bruno; Wang, Zheng; Ahmed, Haider; Zhu, Yuchen",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.04145v1.pdf,344

METHODS: We performed an observational study during the peak of pandemic in our intensive care unit, dosing D-dimer, C-reactive protein, troponin T, lactate dehydrogenase, ferritin, serum iron, transferrin, transferrin saturation, transferrin soluble receptor, lymphocyte count and NK, CD3, CD4, CD8 and B subgroups of 31 patients during the first 2 weeks of their ICU stay. Correlation with mortality and severity at the time of admission was tested with the Spearman coefficient and Mann-Whitney test. Trends over time were tested with the Kruskal-Wallis analysis. RESULTS: Lymphopenia is severe and constant, with a nadir on day 2 of ICU stay (median 0.555 109/L; interquartile range (IQR) 0.450 109/L); all lymphocytic subgroups are dramatically reduced in critically ill patients, while CD4/CD8 ratio remains normal. Neither ferritin nor lymphocyte count follows significant trends in ICU patients. Transferrin saturation is extremely reduced at ICU admission (median 9%; IQR 7%), then significantly increases at days 3 to 6 (median 33%, IQR 26.5%, p value 0.026). The same trend is observed with serum iron levels (median 25.5 µg/L, IQR 69 µg/L at admission; median 73 µg/L, IQR 56 µg/L on days 3 to 6) without reaching statistical significance. Hyperferritinemia is constant during intensive care stay: however, its dosage might be helpful in individuating patients developing haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis. D-dimer is elevated and progressively increases from admission (median 1319 µg/L; IQR 1285 µg/L) to days 3 to 6 (median 6820 µg/L; IQR 6619 µg/L), despite not reaching significant results. We describe trends of all the abovementioned parameters during ICU stay. CONCLUSIONS: The description of iron metabolism and lymphocyte count in Covid-19 patients admitted to the intensive care unit provided with this paper might allow a wider understanding of SARS-CoV-2 pathophysiology.","Bolondi, Giuliano; Russo, Emanuele; Gamberini, Emiliano; Circelli, Alessandro; Meca, Manlio Cosimo Claudio; Brogi, Etrusca; Viola, Lorenzo; Bissoni, Luca; Poletti, Venerino; Agnoletti, Vanni",World J Emerg Surg,,344

Currently, an important approach to understand this phenomenon and its impact on the lives of people consists of monitoring social networks and news on the internet. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study is to present a methodology to capture the main subjects and themes under discussion in news media and social media and to apply this methodology to analyze the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in Brazil. METHODS: This work proposes a methodology based on topic modeling, namely entity recognition, and sentiment analysis of texts to compare Twitter posts and news, followed by visualization of the evolution and impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. We focused our analysis on Brazil, an important epicenter of the pandemic; therefore, we faced the challenge of addressing Brazilian Portuguese texts. RESULTS: In this work, we collected and analyzed 18,413 articles from news media and 1,597,934 tweets posted by 1,299,084 users in Brazil. The results show that the proposed methodology improved the topic sentiment analysis over time, enabling better monitoring of internet media. Additionally, with this tool, we extracted some interesting insights about the evolution of the COVID-19 pandemic in Brazil. For instance, we found that Twitter presented similar topic coverage to news media; the main entities were similar, but they differed in theme distribution and entity diversity. Moreover, some aspects represented negative sentiment toward political themes in both media, and a high incidence of mentions of a specific drug denoted high political polarization during the pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: This study identified the main themes under discussion in both news and social media and how their sentiments evolved over time. It is possible to understand the major concerns of the public during the pandemic, and all the obtained information is thus useful for decision-making by authorities.","de Melo, Tiago; Figueiredo, Carlos M S",JMIR Public Health Surveill,,344

However, there is little information regarding prognostic factors and mortality in COVID-19 from Latin American countries. Objectives To determine prognostic factors in hospitalized COVID-19 patients and to evaluate the impact of tocilizumab use in patients with hyperinflammatory syndrome and severe disease defined by the National Early Warning Score 2 (NEWS2) with a value greater than or equal to seven points. Materials and methods This retrospective cohort study included hospitalized COVID-19 patients from May to July 2020. A multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to determine independent factors associated with mortality. Results A total of 136 patients required hospital admission. In-hospital mortality was 39.7%. Mortality was observed to be potentiated by older age, LDH serum levels and the presence of type 2 diabetes mellitus. Lymphopenia and lower PaO2/FiO2 ratio were more common in these patients. Similarly, patients who died were classified more frequently with severe disease. The independent factors associated with in-hospital mortality were age greater than 65 years, type 2 diabetes mellitus, NEWS2 greater than or equal to seven points and LDH greater than 400U/L. The use of Tocilizumab alone was not related with decreased in-hospital mortality. Subgroup analysis performed in patients with hyperinflammation and severe disease showed similar results. Conclusions COVID-19 mortality in hospitalized patients was high and mainly related with older age, comorbidities, LDH and the severity of disease at hospital admission.","Nunez-Ramos, J.

471453,Online Influence Maximization under Linear Threshold Model,2020-11-12,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the causative agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection, which has emerged as a global pandemic causing serious concerns. Lack of specific and effective therapeutics for the treatment of COVID-19 is a major concern and the development of vaccines is another important aspect in managing the infection effectively. The first step in the SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis is the viral entry and it is mediated by its densely glycosylated spike protein (S-protein). Similar to the SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 also engages angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as the host cell entry receptor. In addition to ACE2, several recent studies have implicated the crucial role of cell surface heparan sulfate (HS) as a necessary assisting cofactor for ACE2-mediated SARS-CoV-2 entry. Furthermore, SARS-CoV-2 was also identified to use both endosomal cysteine proteases cathepsin B and L (CatB/L) and the transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2) for the pivotal role of S-protein priming mediating viral entry. As the entry of SARS-CoV-2 into host cells is mandatory for viral infection, it becomes an extremely attractive therapeutic intervention point. In this regard, this review will focus on the therapeutic targeting of the crucial steps of SARS-CoV-2 viral entry like S-protein/ACE2 interaction and S-protein priming by host cell proteases. In addition, this review will also give insights to the readers on several therapeutic opportunities, pharmacological targeting of the viral-entry facilitators like S-Protein, ACE2, cell surface HS, TMPRSS2, and CatB/L and evidence for those drugs currently ongoing clinical studies.","Muralidar, Shibi; Gopal, Gayathri; Visaga Ambi, Senthil",J Med Virol,,344

473460,Variable Importance Analysis in Imbalanced Datasets: A New Approach,2020,"NEW FINDINGS: For the first time, the alveolar pathway during breath holding was modelled on the hypothesis that it follows a hypoventilation loop on the O2 -CO2 diagram. Validation of the model is possible within the range of alveolar gas compositions compatible with consciousness. Within this range, the experimental data are compatible with the proposed model. The model with its characteristics may allow predictions of alveolar gas composition whenever the alveolar ventilation goes to zero, e.g. static and dynamic breath holding at the surface or during ventilation/intubation failure in anaesthesia. ABSTRACT: Purpose In the hypothesis that alveolar O2 and CO2 partial pressures during breath holding (BH) should vary following a hypoventilation loop, we modelled the alveolar gas pathways during BH on the O2 -CO2 diagram and experimentally tested it during ambient air and pure oxygen breathing. Methods In air, the model was constructed using: the inspired and the alveolar partial pressures of O2 (PI O2 and PA O2 ) and of CO2 (PI CO2 and PA CO2 ), and the steady state values of pre-BH respiratory exchange ratio (RER). In pure oxygen, the model respected the constraint of PA CO2 = -PA O2 + PI O2 . To test this, 12 subjects performed several BH of increasing duration plus one maximal at rest and exercise (30W cycling supine), while breathing air or pure oxygen. We measured gas flows, PA O2 and PA CO2 before and at the end of all BH. Measured data were fitted through the model. Results In air, PI O2 = 150 ± 1 mmHg and PI CO2 = 0.3 ± 0.0 mmHg both at rest and at 30W. Before BH, steady state RER was 0.83 ± 0.16 at rest and 0.77 ± 0.14 at 30W; PA O2 = 107 ± 7 mmHg at rest and 102 ± 8 mmHg at 30W; and PA CO2 = 36 ± 4 mmHg at rest and 38 ± 3 mmHg at 30W. By model fitting we computed RER during early phase of BH: 0.10 (95%CI = 0.08-0.12) at rest and 0.13 (95%CI = 0.11-0.15) at 30W. In oxygen, model fitting provided PI O2 : 692 (95%CI = 688-696) mmHg at rest and 693 (95%CI = 689-698) mmHg at 30W. Conclusion The experimental data are compatible with the proposed model, within its physiological range. This article is protected by copyright.

Mortality recorded among severe-critically ill patients admitted to intensive care units (ICU) has been significantly high, especially in most COVID-19 epicenters. Reports on the unique clinical characteristics and outcomes from the ICU admissions are on-going with isolated studies in Africa. This study was a retrospective single-centre study involving all polymerase chain reaction (PCR) confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) patients admitted to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) of the department of medicine and therapeutics, Korle-Bu Teaching Hospital, over the period of 13th April - 28th June 2020. Twenty-two (22) patients in total fulfilled the inclusion criteria and are included in this report. Patients' socio-demographic characteristics, clinical and laboratory parameters outcomes as well as treatment modalities employed were extracted from their respective medical records and analyzed using STATA version 14. Dyspnoea, fever and cough were most common associated symptoms. The mean duration of admission at the ICU was 4.1 ± 3.0 days with five deaths (22.7%). About 91% (20/22) had at least one comorbidity with hypertension as the most prevalent. The median oxygen saturation/fraction of inspired oxygen (SpO2/FiO2) level was significantly higher in persons with only COVID-19 pneumonia compared to those with complicated respiratory failure (p<0.001). Six (27.3%) out of the 22 patients had non-invasive ventilation, with only 1/22 (4.5%) receiving mechanical ventilation. Although non-significant, the mean duration of ICU stay was relatively shorter in patients who received therapeutic doses of anticoagulation (p=0.32). Duration of treatment with methylprednisolone was significantly associated with patient outcomes (p=0.04) and serum ferritin levels had a tendency to negatively affect outcome (p=0.06). Clearly there are still no specific targeted medications for COVID-19 treatment, except for empirically symptoms-guided treatments and management of mild to critically ill patients. Early use of systemic corticosteroids for severe to critically ill patients in the ICU using S/F ratio and CRP levels may improve outcomes.","Afriyie-Mensah, Jane; Aboagye, Elvis Twumasi; Ganu, Vincent Jessey; Bondzi, Samuel; Tetteh, Dennis; Kwarteng, Ernest; Akamah, Joseph; Doku, Alfred; Adjei, Patrick",Pan Afr Med J,,344

STUDY DESIGN/METHODS: Blood donations collected from 7 March 2020 to 25 September 2020 were tested for SARS-CoV-2 RNA (vRNA) in MP of 6 or 16 donations using the Grifols Procleix SARS-CoV-2 research-use only (RUO) transcription-mediated amplification (TMA) assay. Reactive results were confirmed using an alternate target region TMA assay. Reactive MPs were tested by TMA after serial dilution to estimate viral load. Testing for anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies and infectivity was performed. RESULTS: A total of 17,995 MPs corresponding to approximately 258,000 donations were tested for vRNA. Three confirmed reactive MP16 were identified. The estimated prevalence of vRNA reactive donations was 1.16/100,000 (95% CI 0.40, 3.42). The vRNA-reactive samples were non-reactive for antibody, and the estimated viral loads of the (presumed single) positive donations within each MP ranged from <1000 to <4000 copies/ml. When tested, no infectivity was observed in inoculated permissive cell cultures. DISCUSSION: Blood donation MP-nucleic acid testing (NAT) indicated that SARS-CoV-2 RNAemia is infrequent and, when detected, the vRNA was at low concentrations. Only one RNA-reactive MP could be tested for infectivity for operational reasons and was not infectious in cell culture. These findings support current recommendations from international and national regulatory agencies to not screen donors by NAT.","Bakkour, Sonia; Saá, Paula; Groves, Jamel A; Montalvo, Leilani; Di Germanio, Clara; Best, Sonja M; Grebe, Eduard; Livezey, Kristin; Linnen, Jeffrey M; Strauss, Donna; Kessler, Debra; Bonn, Mark; Green, Valerie; Williamson, Phillip; Kleinman, Steve; Stramer, Susan L; Stone, Mars; Busch, Michael P",Transfusion,,344
478258,Guest Editors’ Corner,2020,"BACKGROUND: Due to the devastating and far-reaching impact of the novel COVID-19 pandemic, hospital resources have been redirected to protect patients and health care staff, thereby vastly reducing the capacity for outpatient follow-up within a busy Plastic Surgery and Hand Trauma center. Through the use of telephone and video technology, virtual clinics were rapidly introduced to reduce hospital footfall. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study analyzed patient experiences in virtual and traditional face-to-face clinics through the month of April 2020, from the second week of the government-imposed lockdown. A 5-point Visit-Specific Satisfaction Questionnaire was used to subsequently collect patients' feedback regarding their appointments. RESULTS: A total of 107 hand injury-related follow-up appointments were recorded during the 4-week period. Sixty (56.0%) appointments were performed as a virtual consultation, and 47 (43.9%) face-to-face consultations were carried out on site. It was possible to discharge 43.3% from the virtual clinic group and 57.4% from the face-to-face group. We identified no significant difference in patient satisfaction (P = .368, Mann-Whitney U test) between the 2 cohorts. CONCLUSION: Virtual clinics appear to be safe and effective for the follow-up of patients with traumatic hand injuries during the COVID-19 pandemic. This approach may prove beneficial in terms of workforce organization, reducing waiting times, and providing an alternative for patients unable to attend physical appointments.","Popova, Dardan; Young, Kieron; Hobday, Dorian; Welman, Ted; Pahal, Gurjinderpal S",Hand (N Y),,344
478340,Hypergeometric L-functions in average polynomial time,2020-05-27,"In late December 2019, strange pneumonia was detected in a seafood market in Wuhan, China which was later termed COVID-19 by the World Health Organization. At present, the virus has spread across 232 countries worldwide killing 2,409,011 as of 17 February 2021 (9:37 CET). Motivated by a recent dataset, knowledge gaps, surge in global cases, and the need to combat the virus spread, this study examined the relationship between COVID-19 confirmed cases and attributable deaths at the global and regional levels. We used a panel of 232 countries (further disaggregated into Africa-49, Americas-54, Eastern Mediterranean-23, Europe-61, Southeast Asia-10, and Western Pacific-35) from 03 January 2020 to 28 November 2020, and the instrumental variable generalized method of moment's model (IV-GMM) for analysing the datasets. The results showed that COVID-19 confirmed cases at both the global and regional levels have a strong positive effect on deaths. Thus, the confirmed cases significantly increase attributable deaths at the global and regional levels. At the global level, a 1% increase in confirmed cases increases attributable deaths by 0.78%. Regionally, a 1% increase in confirmed cases increases attributable deaths by 0.65% in Africa, 0.90% in the Americas, 0.67% in the Eastern Mediterranean, 0.72% in Europe, 0.88% in Southeast Asia, and 0.52% in the Western Pacific. This study expands the understanding of the relationship between COVID-19 cases and deaths by using a global dataset and the instrumental variable generalized method of moment's model (IV-GMM) for the analysis that addresses endogeneity and omitted variable issues.","Appiah-Otoo, Isaac; Kursah, Matthew Biniyam",GeoJournal,,344

Recent reports have shown elevated levels of cytokines due to increased inflammation in patients with SARS-CoV-2 disease. On the other hand, obesity represents a state of low-grade inflammation, with various inflammatory products directly excreted by adipose tissue. In this concise report we aimed to assess common elements of obesity and SARS-CoV-2 infection. METHODS: Pubmed search on obesity and SARS-CoV-2 infection. RESULTS: We present ""mechanistic"" obesity-related problems that aggravate SARS-CoV-2 infection as well as tentative inflammatory/metabolic links between these diseases. CONCLUSION: Obesity and SARS-CoV-2 share common elements of the inflammatory process (and possibly also metabolic disturbances), exacerbating SARS-CoV-2 infection in the obese.","Michalakis, Konstantinos; Ilias, Ioannis",Diabetes Metab Syndr,,344

480220,Clinical significance of ring finger protein 2 high expression in skin squamous cell carcinoma,2020,"This review discusses the philosophical foundations of what used to be called ""the scientific method"" and is nowadays often known as the scientific attitude. It used to be believed that scientific theories and methods aimed at the truth especially in the case of physics, chemistry and astronomy because these sciences were able to develop numerous scientific laws that made it possible to understand and predict many physical phenomena. The situation is different in the case of the biological sciences which deal with highly complex living organisms made up of huge numbers of constituents that undergo continuous dynamic processes; this leads to novel emergent properties in organisms that cannot be predicted because they are not present in the constituents before they have interacted with each other. This is one of the reasons why there are no universal scientific laws in biology. Furthermore, all scientific theories can only achieve a restricted level of predictive success because they remain valid only under the limited range of conditions that were used for establishing the theory' in the first place. Many theories that used to be accepted were subsequently shown to be false, demonstrating that scientific theories always remain tentative and can never be proven beyond and doubt. It is ironical that as scientists have finally accepted that approximate truths are perfectly adequate and that absolute truth is an illusion, a new irrational sociological phenomenon called Post-Truth conveyed by social media, the Internet and fake news has developed in the Western world that is convincing millions of people that truth simply does not exist. Misleading information is circulated with the intention to deceive and science denialism is promoted by denying the remarkable achievements of science and technology during the last centuries. Although the concept of intentional design is widely used to describe the methods that biologists use to make discoveries and inventions, it will be argued that the term is not appropriate for explaining the appearance of life on our planet nor for describing the scientific creativity of scientific investigators. The term rational for describing the development of new vaccines is also unjustified. Because the analysis of the COVID-19 pandemic requires contributions from biomedical and psycho-socioeconomic sciences, one scientific method alone would be insufficient for combatting the pandemic.","Van Regenmortel, Marc H V",Methods (S.

These patients also presented with oral ulcers that resembled aphthous ulcers, of which some also had necrosis and haemorrhagic ulcerations. The time to onset ranged between two to ten days and duration lasted between 5-15 days. The painful ulcers were empirically managed using daily photobiomodulation (PBMT) therapy using a PBMT device (Twin Flex, MMOptics, Sao Carlos, Brazil).Conclusions Oral lesions may precede COVID-19 and progressively worse oral lesions are seen in severe COVID-19 patients. Some of these oral lesions also tend to occur early along with loss of taste and smell in some patients. Taken together, these oral manifestations could serve as early indication of COVID-19 and prompt referral for further testing is recommended.","Kumar, Satish",Evid Based Dent,,344

DESIGN: Country-level ecological study. SETTING: Structural ageism data were drawn from the nationally representative World Values Survey 2010-2014 (WVS), global databases from the WHO, United Nations and the World Bank. Violence data were based on the Global Burden of Diseases (GBD) study 2017. PARTICIPANTS: Analysis of 56 countries that represented 63.1% of the world's ageing population aged 60 and over across all six of WHO regions. EXPOSURE: Structural ageism, following established structural stigma measures, consisted of two components: (1) discriminatory national policies related to older persons' economic, social, civil and political rights, based on the four core components of human rights protection in Madrid International Plan of Action on Aging and (2) prejudicial social norms against older persons, measured by negative attitudes toward older persons in 56 national polls in WVS aggregated to country-level. These components were z scored and combined such that higher score indicated greater structural ageism. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Prevalence rates of violence per 100 000 persons aged 70 and over in each country was based on extensive epidemiological surveillance data, survey, clinical data and insurance claims in GBD and compiled by the Institute of Health Metrics and Evaluation, University of Washington. RESULTS: There was a wide variation in levels of structural ageism across countries. As predicted, structural ageism was significantly associated with the prevalence rates of violence in multivariate models (ß=205.7, SE=96.3, p=0.03), after adjusting for relevant covariates. Sensitivity analyses supported the robustness of our findings. That is, structural ageism did not predict other types of violence and other types of prejudice did not predict violence against older persons.

483002,The engine that drives the industry's growth,2020,"BACKGROUND: Precise placement of stimulating and recording electrodes is vital when performing nerve conduction studies (NCSs). In this study, we aimed to determine whether ultrasonography (US) was more precise in localizing the superficial radial nerve (SRN), dorsal ulnar cutaneous nerve (DUCN), ulnar nerve (UN) crossing the cubital tunnel, and radial nerve (RN) crossing the spiral groove (SG) compared to conventional techniques. METHODS: Thirty healthy young subjects (15 male) were recruited. Each subject underwent both landmark-based and US-guided NCS. Onset latencies and amplitudes of compound motor action potentials (CMAPs) and sensory nerve action potentials (SNAPs), and stimulation levels (ie, intensity × duration) required to obtain maximal CMAP amplitudes were compared between the two techniques. RESULTS: The mean CMAP amplitudes of the UN above the cubital tunnel (9.55 ± 1.96 vs 8.96 ± 1.94 mV, P = .030), UN below the cubital tunnel (10.11 ± 2.07 vs 9.37 ± 1.95 mV, P < .001), and RN below the SG (5.21 ± 1.56 vs 4.34 ± 1.03 mV, P < .001) were significantly greater using US-guided NCSs compared to landmark-based NCSs. The mean onset latency of the DUCN was significantly shorter using US-guided NCSs (1.49 ± 0.15 vs 1.57 ± 0.14 ms, P = .020). The required stimulation level in the UN and RN was significantly lower using US-guided NCSs. CONCLUSIONS: When performing NCSs, US guidance provides a more precise localization of the stimulator and electrodes for the DUCN, UN, and RN, while providing comparable localization for the SRN, compared to landmark-based techniques.","Wei, Kuo-Chang; Chiu, Yi-Hsiang; Wu, Chueh-Hung; Liang, Huey-Wen; Wang, Tyng-Guey",Muscle nerve,,344

483449,Following guidelines during a crisis,2020,"INTRODUCTION: Obesity is a condition that generally limits work capacity and predisposes to a number of comorbidities and related diseases, the last being COVID-19 and its complications and sequelae. Physical exercise, together with diet, is a milestone in its management and rehabilitation, although there is still a debate on intensity and duration of training. Anaerobic threshold (AT) is a broad term often used either as ventilatory threshold or as lactate threshold, respectively, detected by respiratory ventilation and/or respiratory gases (VCO2 and VO2), and by blood lactic acid. AIMS AND METHODOLOGY: This review outlines the role of AT and of the different variations of growth hormone and catecholamine, in subjects with obesity vs normal weight individuals below and beyond AT, during a progressive increase in exercise training. We present a re-evaluation of the effects of physical activity on body mass and metabolism of individuals with obesity in light of potential benefits and pitfalls during COVID-19 pandemic. Comparison of a training program at moderate-intensity exercise (< AT) with training performed at moderate intensity (< AT) plus a final bout of high-intensity (> AT) exercise at the end of the aerobic session will be discussed. RESULTS: Based on our data and considerations, a tailored strategy for individuals with obesity concerning the most appropriate intensity of training in the context of rehabilitation is proposed, with special regard to potential benefits of work program above AT. CONCLUSION: Adding bouts of exercise above AT may improve lactic acid and H+ disposal and improve growth hormone. Long-term aerobic exercise may improve leptin reduction. In this way, the propensity of subjects with obesity to encounter a serious prognosis of COVID-19 may be counteracted and the systemic and cardiorespiratory sequelae that may ensue after COVID-19, can be overcome. Individuals with serious comorbidities associated with obesity should avoid excessive exercise intensity.","Salvadori, Alberto; Fanari, Paolo; Marzullo, Paolo; Codecasa, Franco; Tovaglieri, Ilaria; Cornacchia, Mauro; Terruzzi, Ileana; Ferrulli, Anna; Palmulli, Patrizia; Brunani, Amelia; Lanzi, Stefano; Luzi, Livio",Acta diabetol,,344

486104,Micro-Mobilities in Lockdown,2021,"On 31 December 2019, the World Health Organization (WHO) office in China received a report of 29 pneumonia cases of unknown aetiology in Wuhan city in Hubei province, central China Within 1 week it became clear that the initial cases were associated with a seafood market where live poultry and wild animals were also sold The virus was quickly identified as a novel beta-coronavirus and the genetic sequence was shared on 12 January 2020 The infection is now officially termed COVID-19 and the virus SARS-CoV-2 News of this outbreak gave many public health officials an involuntary shudder as they recalled the parallels with the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak that arose in China in November 2002 That outbreak was also caused by a novel coronavirus spilling over from an animal reservoir and transmitted by respiratory droplets SARS spread to many parts of the world through international air travel, caused more than 8000 cases and 774 deaths and cost in the region US$20 billion to control Within less than a month COVID-19 had spread throughout China and to neighbouring countries, even to the USA and Europe It became clear that the new virus was highly transmissible from person to person but was considerably less virulent, with less than 20% of cases being classified as severe It has the clinical features of an atypical pneumonia with fever, dry cough, fatigue, dyspnoea and myalgia and is more often severe in those with comorbidities and the elderly Since there are no specific therapies or vaccines available, standard public health measures appropriate for a virus spread by droplets, close contact and on environmental surfaces were instituted The Chinese authorities conducted active case finding and testing, contact tracing and quarantining of cases and contacts The public was advised to stay at home if sick, in an effort to control the spread of the virus On 30 January 2020 the WHO declared the outbreak a public health emergency of international concern, their highest level of severity, at a time when there were almost 10 000 confirmed cases, more than 200 deaths and it had spread to 20 countries The Chinese authorities had by then instituted highly stringent control measures, including stopping flights and public transport in Wuhan and other major cities, closing animal wet markets, extending the New Year holiday period in an effort to prevent mass travel, reducing movements within cities, minimizing mass gatherings, keeping schools closed, staggering office and factory working hours and restricting movement on the streets The wearing of face masks became compulsory and, in effect, the population of Hubei province, more than 50 million people, were in quarantine The authorities also built two new hospitals with more than 2500 beds within 2 weeks to cope with the surge in demand for medical care By the middle of March, less than 3 months into the epidemic, there had been more than 200 000 cases confirmed worldwide with more than 8000 deaths, vastly surpassing the SARS epidemic The number of cases reported has been highest in China, although cases have now been reported in 159 countries and territories on six continents Over 70 countries have instituted travel restrictions The main initial battle to control this epidemic has been in China, where heroic public health measures have bought the rest of the world time and may have reduced the effective reproduction number to close to 1, thereby bringing the epidemic under control However, the rest of the world needs to maintain high vigilance, as this virus is highly transmissible and can cause severe disease and death, as has been seen in countries such as South Korea, Iran and Italy Indeed, the number of new cases is now highest in Europe Containment through case finding and isolation and contact tracing and social distancing remain the key public health approaches to controlling the epidemic in all parts of the world This is particularly important for countries in sub-Saharan Africa and also those parts of South and Central America and Asia that are not well-prepared for outbreaks Global solidarity and support are essential, as infectious diseases can easily cross borders, and as John Nkengasong, from the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC) has said, ‘The global health chain is only as strong as its weakest link, so a disease threat anywhere can quickly become a threat everywhere’ Preparedness to respond to outbreaks is weak in many countries Of the 45 low-income countries that have undertaken a national preparedness assessment, none have been deemed ready to respond, making them particularly vulnerable to outbreaks There are many reasons for this, including poor health and nutrition, exacerbated by high rates of concomitant human immunodeficiency virus and tuberculosis, and low influenza vaccination rates;poor quality of healthcare and resource constraints, as low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) spend on average only $267 annually per person on health;and vulnerable supply chains and weak medicine procurement, and up to 30% of medicines are substandard or falsified In response to the outbreak, the African Union Commission is strengthening partnerships and coordination across the continent, including a common approach for monitoring and movement restriction of people at risk for COVID-19 and for information sharing The WHO has found the regional readiness level to be only 66%, with critical gaps and a need to strengthen the capacities for countries to investigate alerts, treat patients in isolation facilities and improve infection, prevention and control (IPC) in health facilities and communities More than 40 experts have deployed to 10 countries to support preparedness activities and the diagnostic capacity for COVID-19 has been strengthened, with 17 countries now having at least some capacity for laboratory testing [Truncated]","Jimmy, Whitworth",,,344

This retrospective cohort study aimed at investigating Italian adult population lifestyle changes during COVID-19 pandemic ""Phase 1"" lockdown (8 March-4 May 2020) and discriminate between positive and negative changes and BMI (body mass index) variations (&#916;BMI). METHODS: A multiple-choice web-form survey was used to collect retrospective data regarding lifestyle/eating behaviours during ""Phase 1"" in the Italian adult population. According to changes in lifestyle/eating behaviours, the sample was divided into three classes of changes: ""negative change"", ""no change"", ""positive change"". For each class, correlations with &#916;BMI were investigated. RESULTS: Data were collected from 1304 subjects (973F/331M). Mean &#916;BMI differed significantly (p < 0.001) between classes, and was significantly related to water intake, alcohol consumption, physical activity, frequency of ""craving or snacking between meals"", dessert/sweets consumption at lunch. CONCLUSIONS: During ""Phase 1"", many people faced several negative changes in lifestyle/eating behaviours with potential negative impact on health. These findings highlight that pandemic exacerbates nutritional issues and most efforts need to be done to provide nutrition counselling and public health services to support general population needs.","Maffoni, Silvia; Brazzo, Silvia; De Giuseppe, Rachele; Biino, Ginevra; Vietti, Ilaria; Pallavicini, Cristina; Cena, Hellas",Nutrients,,344

With regard to the current crisis period, the survey is supplemented by identifying factors of employment change, focusing mainly on the region's competitiveness in tourism. The importance of regions is assessed in the article on the basis of potential for tourism development, further in terms of their importance for tourism in Slovakia based on tourism performance expressed by the number of overnight stays and on the basis of industry concentration of tourism measured by employment in tourism. We consider the most vulnerable regions to be those that reach the level of specialization in tourism (based on the localization coefficient) and it has a growing tendency. The research results show that the importance of regional competitiveness in tourism for employment change (which is a regional component) is very different despite the established destination management, it is even negative, and in the case of positive figures, it is without an obvious advantage over other factors analyzed in the shift-share analysis. Also, it is possible that the current crisis period caused by measures in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic will help to find endogenous solutions to fragmented destination management in the most important and vulnerable tourism regions, or legislative solutions related to the amendment to the Tourism Promotion Act. © 2021 Anna Michálková et al., published by Sciendo 2021.","Michálková, A.; Gáll, J.",European Countryside,,344

Looking at the present scenario and the kind of pandemic that it has turned out to be, this paper aims at providing an enhancement to the RT-PCR way of testing and uses the chest X-Rays to detect the presence and severity of the corona virus in a body to successfully differentiate between pneumonia and the Covid-19. The main motive is to help doctors and medical experts with an advance aid to the nursing of critically affected patients. This is feasible because the X-Ray machines are widely available throughout the country and they can assist in the advanced detection of the disease. Around 6000 images of the three kinds of chest X-Rays of patients with pneumonia, Covid, as well as completely normal patients, were used in the process. The paper concludes with the explicit comparison of all the models and their results. Primarily, a simple CNN model was opted for the scrutiny and then later on VGG-16, VGG-19, ResNet50, MobileNet and MobileNetV2 pre-trained models were utilised for anatomizing Covid-19 with respect to pneumonia and normal cases. In case of CNN, the maximum accuracy that was attained was 95.30% whereas, for the VGG-16, VGG-19, ResNet50, MobileNet and MobileNetV2, the maximum accuracies in correctly predicting the diseases were 95.63%, 96.02%, 94.82%, 95.23% and 93.39% respectively. © 2021 IEEE.","Saha, I.; Gourisaria, M.

However, response to vaccines may be less predictable in immunocompromised people. While outcomes for individuals with autoimmune and autoinflammatory diseases have dramatically improved with treatment using immunomodulating and biologic agents, infections have caused significant morbidity in these people today often more than due to their underlying diseases. Immune-based biologic therapies contribute to these infectious complications. This review addresses anti-viral vaccines, their effectiveness and safety in patients treated with approved biologic agents and immune targeted therapy with a focus on vaccines against influenza, human papillomavirus, hepatitis B virus and varicella zoster virus. Preliminary information regarding SARS-CoV-2 anti-viral vaccines is addressed. Additionally, we present recommendations regarding the safe use of vaccines in immunocompromised individuals with the goal to enhance awareness of the safety and efficacy of these anti-viral vaccines in these high-risk populations.","Ostrov, Barbara E; Amsterdam, Daniel",Immunol Invest,,344
488756,Achieving A Certain Major Achievement During Uncertain Times,2020,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is spreading all over the world and has caused millions of deaths. Several sample-to-answer platforms, including Cepheid Xpert Xpress SARS-CoV-2 (Xpert Xpress), have received emergency use authorization for SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid detection as a point of care test in the United States. However, their application niche is unclear when compared with real-time RT-PCR assays cleared by the National Medical Products Administration in China. In this study, the clinical performance, sensitivity, and workflow of Xpert Xpress and two real-time RT-PCR kits (BioGerm kit and Sansure kit) were evaluated by the specimens from 86 symptomatic patients. The positive percent agreement of Xpert Xpress was 100% compared with 96.15% for the BioGerm kit and 90% for the Sansure kit. The negative percent agreement was 100% for all three assays. The limit of detection is 100 copies/mL for Xpert Xpress and 500 copies/mL for the BioGerm kit and Sansure kit. By serially diluting five positive specimens, the Xpert Xpress had better detection capability. In the workflow and throughput analysis, the turnaround time was 51 minutes for Xpert Xpress, 150 minutes for the BioGerm kit, and 210 minutes for the Sansure kit. This study provides some indication for diagnosis methods selection.","Wen, Donghua; Yang, Simin; Li, Guangbo; Xuan, Qiankun; Guo, Wenzheng; Wu, Wenjuan",J Mol Diagn,,344
488824,Responding to the Coronavirus: Reinventing Ourselves through Transformative Problem Solving,2020,"Essential oils have shown promise as antiviral agents against several pathogenic viruses. In this work we hypothesized that essential oil components may interact with key protein targets of the 2019 severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). A molecular docking analysis was carried out using 171 essential oil components with SARS-CoV-2 main protease (SARS-CoV-2 Mpro), SARS-CoV-2 endoribonucleoase (SARS-CoV-2 Nsp15/NendoU), SARS-CoV-2 ADP-ribose-1â³-phosphatase (SARS-CoV-2 ADRP), SARS-CoV-2 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (SARS-CoV-2 RdRp), the binding domain of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (SARS-CoV-2 rS), and human angiotensin-converting enzyme (hACE2). The compound with the best normalized docking score to SARS-CoV-2 Mpro was the sesquiterpene hydrocarbon (E)-ß-farnesene. The best docking ligands for SARS-CoV Nsp15/NendoU were (E,E)-&#945;-farnesene, (E)-ß-farnesene, and (E,E)-farnesol. (E,E)-Farnesol showed the most exothermic docking to SARS-CoV-2 ADRP. Unfortunately, the docking energies of (E,E)-&#945;-farnesene, (E)-ß-farnesene, and (E,E)-farnesol with SARS-CoV-2 targets were relatively weak compared to docking energies with other proteins and are, therefore, unlikely to interact with the virus targets. However, essential oil components may act synergistically, essential oils may potentiate other antiviral agents, or they may provide some relief of COVID-19 symptoms.","Silva, Joyce Kelly R da; Figueiredo, Pablo Luis Baia; Byler, Kendall G; Setzer, William N",,,344

Clinical manifestations of COVID-19 vary, ranging from asymptomatic infection to respiratory failure. The mechanisms that determine such variable outcomes remain unresolved. Here we investigated CD4+ T cells that are reactive against the spike glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 in the peripheral blood of patients with COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2-unexposed healthy donors. We detected spike-reactive CD4+ T cells not only in 83% of patients with COVID-19 but also in 35% of healthy donors. Spike-reactive CD4+ T cells in healthy donors were primarily active against C-terminal epitopes in the spike protein, which show a higher homology to spike glycoproteins of human endemic coronaviruses, compared with N-terminal epitopes. Spike-protein-reactive T cell lines generated from SARS-CoV-2-naive healthy donors responded similarly to the C-terminal region of the spike proteins of the human endemic coronaviruses 229E and OC43, as well as that of SARS-CoV-2. This results indicate that spike-protein cross-reactive T cells are present, which were probably generated during previous encounters with endemic coronaviruses. The effect of pre-existing SARS-CoV-2 cross-reactive T cells on clinical outcomes remains to be determined in larger cohorts. However, the presence of spike-protein cross-reactive T cells in a considerable fraction of the general population may affect the dynamics of the current pandemic, and has important implications for the design and analysis of upcoming trials investigating COVID-19 vaccines.","Braun, Julian; Loyal, Lucie; Frentsch, Marco; Wendisch, Daniel; Georg, Philipp; Kurth, Florian; Hippenstiel, Stefan; Dingeldey, Manuela; Kruse, Beate; Fauchere, Florent; Baysal, Emre; Mangold, Maike; Henze, Larissa; Lauster, Roland; Mall, Marcus A; Beyer, Kirsten; Röhmel, Jobst; Voigt, Sebastian; Schmitz, Jürgen; Miltenyi, Stefan; Demuth, Ilja; Müller, Marcel A; Hocke, Andreas; Witzenrath, Martin; Suttorp, Norbert; Kern, Florian; Reimer, Ulf; Wenschuh, Holger; Drosten, Christian; Corman, Victor M; Giesecke-Thiel, Claudia; Sander, Leif Erik; Thiel, Andreas",Nature,,344

492846,Back to the future,2021,"Mobile network operator (MNO) data are a rich data source for official statistics, such as present population, mobility, migration, and tourism. Estimating the geographic location of mobile devices is an essential step for statistical inference. Most studies use the Voronoi tessellation for this, which is based on the assumption that mobile devices are always connected to the nearest radio cell. This paper uses a modular Bayesian approach, allowing for different modules of prior knowledge about where devices are expected to be, and different modules for the likelihood of connection given a geographic location. We discuss and compare the use of several prior modules, including one that is based on land use. We show that the Voronoi tessellation can be used as a likelihood module. Alternatively, we propose a signal strength model using radio cell properties such as antenna height, propagation direction, and power. Using Bayes' rule, we derive a posterior probability distribution that is an estimate for the geographic location, which can be used for further statistical inference. We describe the method and provide illustrations of a fictional example that resembles a real-world situation. The method has been implemented in the R packages mobloc and mobvis, which are briefly described.","Tennekes, Martijn; Gootzen, Yvonne A.P.M.",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2110.00439v1.pdf,344
492847,Back to the future,2021,"Linalool is abundant in tea leaves and contributes greatly to tea aroma. The two isomers of linalool, (R)-linalool and (S)-linalool, exist in tea leaves. Our study found that (R)-linalool was the minor isomer in nine of Camellia sinensis var. sinensis cultivars. The (R)-linalool synthase of tea plant CsRLIS was identified subsequently. It is a chloroplast-located protein and specifically catalyzes the formation of (R)-linalool in vitro and in vivo. CsRLIS was observed to be a stress-responsive gene and caused the accumulation of internal (R)-linalool during oolong tea manufacture, mechanical wounding, and insect attack. Further study demonstrated that the catalytic efficiency of CsRLIS was much lower than that of (S)-linalool synthase CsSLIS, which might explain the lower (R)-linalool proportion in C. sinensis var. sinensis cultivars. The relative expression levels of CsRLIS and CsSLIS may also affect the (R)-linalool proportions among C. sinensis var. sinensis cultivars. This information will help us understand differential distributions of chiral aroma compounds in tea.","Zhou, Ying; Deng, Rufang; Xu, Xinlan; Yang, Ziyin",J. agric. Food chem,,344

The current study examined the effect of social support on mental health of health care workers and its underlying mechanisms regarding the mediating role of resilience and moderating role of age during the epidemic. METHODS: Social Support Rating Scale (SSRS), Connor-Davidson Resilience scale (CD-RISC) and Symptom Checklist 90 (SCL-90) were administrated among 1472 health care workers from Jiangsu Province, China during the peak period of COVID-19 outbreak. Structural equation modeling (SEM) was used to examine the mediation effect of resilience on the relation between social support and mental health, whereas moderated mediation analysis was performed by Hayes PROCESS macro. RESULTS: The findings showed that resilience could partially mediate the effect of social support on mental health among health care workers. Age group moderated the indirect relationship between social support and mental health via resilience. Specifically, compared with younger health care workers, the association between resilience and mental health would be attenuated in the middle-aged workers. CONCLUSIONS: The results add knowledge to previous literature by uncovering the underlying mechanisms between social support and mental health. The present study has profound implications for mental health services for health care workers during the peak period of COVID-19.","Hou, Tianya; Zhang, Taiquan; Cai, Wenpeng; Song, Xiangrui; Chen, Aibin; Deng, Guanghui; Ni, Chunyan",PLoS One,,344

496362,Introduction to a New “Commentaries” Section in the Journal of Borderlands Studies,2020,"Wet markets are a critical part of South-East Asian culture and economy. However, their role in circulation and transmission of both endemic and emerging disease is a source of concern in a region considered a hotspot of disease emergence. In the Lao People's Democratic Republic (Lao PDR, Laos), live and dead wild animals are frequently found in wet markets, despite legislation against the bushmeat trade. This is generally considered to increase the risk of disease transmission and emergence, although whether or not wildlife vendors themselves have indeed increased incidence of zoonotic disease has rarely been assessed. In preparation for a future longitudinal study of market vendors investigating vendors' exposure to zoonotic pathogens, we conducted a pilot survey of Lao market vendors of wildlife meat, livestock meat and vegetables, to identify demographic characteristics and potential control groups within markets. We also investigated baseline risk perception for infectious diseases among market vendors and assessed the association between risk perception and risk mitigation behaviours. The surveys conducted with 177 vendors revealed similar age, sex, ethnic background and geographical origin between vendor types, but differences in professional background and work history for livestock meat vendors. The perception of disease risk was very low across all vendors, as was the reported use of personal protective equipment, and the two appeared unrelated. Personal risk discounting and assumptions about transmission routes may explain this lack of association. This information will help inform the development of future research, risk communication and risk mitigation policy, especially in the light of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Philavong, Chanfong; Pruvot, Mathieu; Reinharz, Daniel; Mayxay, Mayfong; Khammavong, Kongsy; Milavong, Phonesavanh; Rattanavong, Sayapeth; Horwood, Paul F; Dussart, Philippe; Douangngeun, Bounlom; Theppangna, Watthana; Fine, Amanda E; Robinson, Matthew T; Newton, Paul N",Zoonoses Public Health,,344
496798,Dynamics of epidemic models from cavity master equations,2020-06-29,"In human development, normal formation of the body cavity involves intricate interplay of tissues folding from a flat disc form into a complex tube-within-tube 3D structure over a short period of time. Understanding the normal body cavity formation is imperative to understanding anatomic organizations, variations and congenital conditions. Unfortunately, resources that effectively demonstrate changing body cavity anatomy during the folding process are sparse and their educational effectiveness is not well understood. Therefore, an interactive digital resource, the ?Virtual Folding Embryo? (VFE), demonstrating the 4-dimensional transformation of the folding embryo (Figure 1) was created and its educational value was assessed in a COMIRB exempt (#20-2125) randomized single blind study. As a part of the flipped curriculum, 155 first-year medical students enrolled in an integrated anatomy course first viewed a pre-recorded lecture on embryology of the thorax then completed a quiz to test their foundational knowledge before attending a synchronous online active learning session conducted on the Zoom platform. Students were randomized into small breakout groups of 4-5 students and half of the groups were given access to the VFE (Figure 2), while the other half were given access to a resource demonstrating a different embryonic process. After 15 minutes, all students completed a quiz and an optional survey. A one-way repeated measures ANOVA revealed a significant increase in the post-quiz performance compared to the pre-quiz in both groups (F (1, 306) =21.06, p&lt;0.05, effect size h2 = 0.06, Tukey HSD, p &lt; 0.05). However, there was no significant difference in the improved performance between the experimental and the control groups (F (1,150) = 0.46, p=0.50). Descriptive statistics on the qualitative survey analysis indicate that students positively perceived the VFE for visually elucidating the transformation of the body cavity (n=74 mean Likert score = 4 on 5 point agreement scale;sd=0.81) and its spatial relationship to organ systems (mean=3.83;sd=0.93). Despite the favorable perception of VFE and improved quiz performance, students rated their level of confidence in the material low (mean=2.18, sd=0.37). Thematic analysis of survey comments reinforced positive perception of the VFE and indicated desire for more time for VFE interaction. These results do not conclusively demonstrate direct correlation between the VFE and learning outcomes. However, qualitative results warrant further development and investigation of the VFE under different educational circumstances to determine efficacy. Virtual 4D resource such as VFE, designed for active learning may hold potential to enrich student engagement in the post COVID-19 era, and serve as a model for creating similar resources in the future.","Hull, Andrew Salcedo Ernesto Stratford Jennifer Hight Marissa Bunker Hailey Lee Lisa",The FASEB Journal,,344

Many addressed a bundle of travel-related control measures (n=49). Most studies assessed infectious disease (n=98) and/or screening-related (n=25) outcomes; we found only limited evidence on economic and social outcomes. Studies applied numerous methods, both inferential and descriptive in nature, ranging from simple observational methods to complex modelling techniques. CONCLUSIONS: We identified a heterogeneous and complex evidence base on travel-related control measures. While this map is not sufficient to assess the effectiveness of different measures, it outlines aspects regarding interventions and outcomes, as well as study methodology and reporting that could inform future research and evidence synthesis.","Movsisyan, Ani; Burns, Jacob; Biallas, Renke; Coenen, Michaela; Geffert, Karin; Horstick, Olaf; Klerings, Irma; Pfadenhauer, Lisa Maria; von Philipsborn, Peter; Sell, Kerstin; Strahwald, Brigitte; Stratil, Jan M; Voss, Stephan; Rehfuess, Eva",BMJ Open,,344
497312,The assessment of buildings and constructions sector of economy proposal: an environmental perspective,2021,"Amino acid deprivation or supplementation can affect cellular and organismal lifespan, but we know little about the role of concentration changes in free, intracellular amino acids during aging. Here, we determine free amino-acid levels during chronological aging of non-dividing fission yeast cells. We compare wild-type with long-lived mutant cells that lack the Pka1 protein of the protein kinase A signalling pathway. In wild-type cells, total amino-acid levels decrease during aging, but much less so in pka1 mutants. Two amino acids strongly change as a function of age: glutamine decreases, especially in wild-type cells, while aspartate increases, especially in pka1 mutants. Supplementation of glutamine is sufficient to extend the chronological lifespan of wild-type but not of pka1&#916; cells. Supplementation of aspartate, on the other hand, shortens the lifespan of pka1&#916; but not of wild-type cells. Our results raise the possibility that certain amino acids are biomarkers of aging, and their concentrations during aging can promote or limit cellular lifespan.","Rallis, Charalampos; Mülleder, Michael; Smith, Graeme; Au, Yan Zi; Ralser, Markus; Bähler, Jürg","J. gerontol.

498079,Annual Report of the Secretary-Treasurer,2021,"Given the need to understand both the negative and positive psychological consequences of the current global COVID-19 pandemic (Brewin et al. in Perspectives in Public Health 10.1177/1757913920957365 2020), the aim of this study was to test a cognitive model of post-traumatic symptoms (PTS) and post-traumatic growth (PTG) during confinement caused by the SARS-COV-2 epidemic. In line with cognitive models of trauma elaboration (Park in Psychological Bulletin 10.1037/a0018301), we included in our model some beliefs associated to the world (e.g., primal beliefs about a good world), to the self (e.g., death anxiety or orientation toward the future) and to others (e.g., suspiciousness or identification with humanity). To evaluate the explanatory model, a national representative sample of adults between the ages of 18 and 75 (N = 1951) was surveyed between 7th and 13th April, 2020, in the middle of a strict 7-week national confinement. Structural equation modelling yielded a very similar model to the one initially specified. The results highlight the role of both negative and positive core beliefs, which are pertinent to the current pandemic threat, in the appearance of PTS and PTG, respectively. In short, primal beliefs about a good world, openness to the future and identification with humanity were associated with PTG; while suspiciousness, intolerance of uncertainty, anxiety about death and also identification with humanity were associated with PTS and consequent impairment. This is an innovative study of different pathways to traumatic responses and growth during a pandemic. Future research is needed to replicate its findings.","Vazquez, Carmelo; Valiente, Carmen; García, Felipe E; Contreras, Alba; Peinado, Vanesa; Trucharte, Almudena; Bentall, Richard P",J Happiness Stud,,344

The latest literature clearly indicates that modulation of effector functions of neutrophils may affect the treatment efficacy. Pharmacological modulation may affect molecular mechanisms activating or suppressing phagocytosis, degranulation or NET formation. In this review, we describe the role of neutrophils in physiology and in the course of bacterial and viral infections, illustrating the versatility and plasticity of those cells. This review also focus on the action of plant extracts, plant-derived compounds and synthetic drugs on effector functions of neutrophils. These recent advances in the knowledge can help to devise novel therapeutic approaches via pharmacological modulation of the described processes.","Gierlikowska, B.; Stachura, A.; Gierlikowski, W.; Demkow, U.",Frontiers in Pharmacology,,344

Several minerals appear to be important determinants of insulin-like growth factor (IGF), the bioactivity of which regulates bone and mineral metabolism. Here we proposed that mineral status may alter the IGF system among individuals with osteoporosis. This study aims to evaluate the relationships between essential elements and IGF levels among postmenopausal Saudi women with osteoporosis. A total of 128 postmenopausal Saudi women aged &#8805;50 years old were recruited in this study. Diagnosis of osteoporosis was done by using dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry to determine the bone minerals density (BMD). Serum calcium and phosphate were determined using routine chemical analyzer. Serum Co, Mn, Ni, Cd were measured using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. Serum IGF-1 and IGF-2 were determined using Luminex xMAP. Using stepwise linear regression analysis, only Cd was identified to be significantly associated with IGF1 in osteoporosis, explaining 3% (confidence interval 0.01-0.05; Pâ=â0001) of the variance perceived. Our results suggest that Cd exposure indirectly affects BMD which may increase the risk of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women. Further longitudinal study using a larger sample size is recommended to determine causality of Cd levels and IGF-1.","Yakout, Sobhy M; Alharbi, Fatimah; Abdi, Saba; Al-Daghri, Nasser M; Al-Amro, Abir; Khattak, Malak Nawaz Khan",Medicine (Baltimore),,344

498974,Embedding responsible innovation within synthetic biology research and innovation: insights from a UK multi-disciplinary research centre,2020,"At present, the epidemic situation of COVID-19 is raging rampantly in the whole world, affecting the hearts of billions of people. The new coronavirus has been detected in many foods and agricultural products. At the same time, vaccines and medicines to prevent or treat COVID-19 are also stepping up research and development and gradually put into use. The quality and safety of foods, medicines, and agricultural products are directly related to the lives and health of people. There are many potential dangers and hidden risks of accidents in the production, sale, and transportation of dangerous goods and special equipment. Therefore, it is necessary to effectively monitor and record the workflow of the above productions or goods. In this paper, we developed an important product traceability public service cloud platform (IPTPSCP) based on batch identification and record keeping with International Two-Dimensional Code Object Identifier System (IDcode) coding rules. Through a case study of the tea factory that produces and sells Xinyang Maojian tea, a test and implementation of IPTPSCP was shown by designing a colorful QR code to prevent the traceability information from being forged in batches. Judging from the overall effect of the practical application of more than a dozen settled enterprises, IPTPSCP has improved the efficiency of data collection and monitoring by about 13%. The results show that the IPTPSCP can be considered as an effective tool to guarantee the quality and safety of products. Besides, since it is not required for the enterprise to invest much money and manpower to develop software, IPTPSCP reduces the cost of implementing product traceability by about 36%.

499317,India slated for using facial recognition in virus battle,2021,"Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is caused by a new strain of coronavirus, the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 or SARS-CoV-2. At the time of writing, SARS-CoV-2 has infected over 5 million people worldwide. A key step in understanding the pathobiology of the SARS-CoV-2 was the identification of -converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as the receptor for SARS-CoV-2 to gain entry into host cells. ACE2 is an established component of the 'protective arm' of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone-system (RAAS) that opposes ACE/angiotensin II (ANG II) pressor and tissue remodelling actions. Identification of ACE2 as the entry point for SARS-CoV-2 into cells quickly focused attention on the use of ACE inhibitors (ACEi), angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRA) in patients with hypertension and cardiovascular disease given that these pharmacological agents upregulate ACE2 expression in target cells. ACE2 is cleaved from the cells by metalloproteases ADAM10 and ADAM17. Steroid hormone receptors regulate multiple components of the RAAS and may contribute to the observed variation in the incidence of severe COVID-19 between men and women, and in patients with pre-existing endocrine-related disease. Moreover, glucocorticoids play a critical role in the acute and chronic management of inflammatory disease, independent of any effect on RAAS activity. Dexamethasone, a synthetic glucocorticoid, has emerged as a life-saving treatment in severe COVID-19. This review will examine the endocrine mechanisms that control ACE2 and discusses the impact of therapies targeting the RAAS, glucocorticoid and other endocrine systems for their relevance to the impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection and the treatment and recovery from COVID-19-related critical illness.","Young, Morag J; Clyne, Colin D; Chapman, Karen E",J Endocrinol,,344

Evaluation of biomarkers predicting severity is crucial to identify patients at high risk of disease progression and poor prognosis. Serum Amyloid A (SAA) is an acute-phase protein mainly produced by the liver in response to pro-inflammatory cytokines. In this study, we investigated SAA levels at admission (T1) and after 15 days (T2) of hospitalization in two groups of patients: survivors and non-survivors. At T1, the non-survivors showed higher SAA level than survivors (74 mg/dL vs 48.75 mg/dL). At T2, the survivor group value decreased to 6.55 mg/dL, the non-survivor group still showed high levels (51.1 mg/dL). The SAA level in control group was 0.35 mg/dL. Furthermore, a cut-off value of 63 mg/dL able to discriminate survivors from non-survivors was established by ROC curve analysis at T1. At T2, the cut-off decreased to 30.9 mg/dL. A similar decreasing trend was observed for D-Dimer, hsCRP, IL-6 and procalcitonin levels. The results of this retrospective study suggest that SAA is a good marker of COVID-19 disease alone and/or in combination with other inflammatory biomarkers. Identification of reliable prognostic analytes is of great clinical relevance, as it would improve patient management besides being costs saving.","Pieri, Massimo; Ciotti, Marco; Nuccetelli, Marzia; Perrone, Marco Alfonso; Caliò, Maria Teresa; Lia, Maria Stella; Minieri, Marilena; Bernardini, Sergio",Int Immunopharmacol,,344

Interactions between allergy-related inflammatory and psychiatric disorders including depression, anxiety and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) have been documented. Therefore, those who have pre-existing allergic conditions may have an increased psychiatric reaction to the stresses of the COVID-19 pandemic. Objective: Identify the psychological impact of COVID-19 in patients with allergic diseases and determine if these individuals have a greater risk of presenting with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Methods: It is a cross-sectional, survey-based study designed to assess the degree of symptoms of depression and the risk of PTSD using the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) and the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R), respectively in allergic patients. Results: A total of 4,106 surveys were evaluated; 1,656 (40.3%) were patients with allergic disease, and 2,450 (59.7%) were non-allergic (control) individuals. Of those with allergies, 76.6% had respiratory allergic disease including asthma and allergic rhinitis. Individuals with allergic disease reported higher scores regarding symptoms of PTSD on the IES-R scale (p = 0.052, OR 1.24 CI .99 - 1.55) as well as a higher depression risk score in the PHQ-9 questionnaire (mean 6.82 vs. 5.28) p = 0.000 z = -8.76.The allergy group presented a higher score in the IES-R questionnaire (mean 25.42 vs. 20.59), being more susceptible to presenting PTSD (p = 0.000, z = -7.774).The individuals with allergic conditions were further divided into subgroups of those with respiratory allergies such as allergic rhinitis and asthma vs those with non-respiratory allergies such as drug and food allergy, urticaria and atopic dermatitis. This subgroup analysis compares respiratory versus non-respiratory allergic patients, with similar results on the IES-R (mean 25.87 vs 23.9) p = 0.0124, z = -1.539. There was no significant difference on intrusion (p=0.061, z=-1.873) and avoidance (p=0.767, z=-0.297), but in the hyperarousal subscale, patients with respiratory allergy had higher scores (mean 1.15 vs. 0.99) p = 0.013 z = -2.486. Conclusions: Psychological consequences such as depression and reported PTSD are present during the COVID-19 pandemic causing an impact particularly in individuals with allergic diseases.

Here, we show that functionalization of the 4-arylidene position of the fluorescent curcumin scaffold with an aryl nitrogen mustard provides a stable Hck inhibitor (Kd = 50 ± 10 nM). The mustard curcumin derivative preferentially interacts with the inactive conformation of Hck, similar to type-II kinase inhibitors that are less promiscuous. Moreover, the lead compound showed no inhibitory effect on three other kinases (DYRK2, Src and Abl). We demonstrate that the cytotoxicity may be mediated via inhibition of the SFK signalling pathway in triple-negative breast cancer and murine macrophage cells. Our data suggest that curcumin is a modifiable fluorescent scaffold to develop selective kinase inhibitors by remodelling its target affinity and cellular stability.","Chakraborty, Manas Pratim; Bhattacharyya, Sudipta; Roy, Souryadip; Bhattacharya, Indira; Das, Rahul; Mukherjee, Arindam",J Biol Chem,,344
507960,The Impact of Indocyanine-Green Fluorescence Angiography on Intraoperative Decision-Making and Postoperative Outcome in Free Flap Surgery,2020,"Active epidemiological surveillance of infectious agents represents a fundamental tool for understanding the transmission dynamics of pathogens and establishing public policies that can reduce or limit their expansion. Epidemiological surveillance of emerging agents, such as the recently recognized severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the cause of COVID-19, is essential to establish the risk of transmission between species. Recent studies reveal that companion animals are organisms susceptible to being infected by this pathogen due to the close contact they have with their owners. For this reason, the aim of the present work was to detect the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in dogs and cats in the state of Veracruz, Mexico, where there is active transmission of this microorganism in human populations. Oral and nasopharyngeal swab samples were collected from dogs and cats with a history of exposure to patients with COVID-19. Total RNA was extracted and detection of viral genes N1 and N2 was performed by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). All 130 samples of companion animals tested by RT-qPCR for SARS-CoV-2 were negative at the time they were collected. This study represents the second active surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 in populations of domestic dogs and cats in Latin America and the first approach in Mexico. Given that coronaviruses have shown a high capacity to be transmitted between species, it is imperative to establish measures to prevent this agent from entering and establishing in populations of companion animals.","Sánchez-Montes, Sokani; Ballados-González, Gerardo G; Gamboa-Prieto, Janete; Cruz-Romero, Anabel; Romero-Salas, Dora; Pérez-Brígido, Carlos D; Austria-Ruíz, María J; Guerrero-Reyes, Alfredo; Lammoglia-Villagómez, Miguel A; Camacho-Peralta, Ireri P; Morales-Narcia, José Á; Bravo-Ramos, José L; Barrientos-Villeda, Manuel; Blanco-Velasco, Leopoldo A; Becker, Ingeborg",Transbound. emerg. dis.

Isolated pathogens are usually nasopharyngeal bacteria, most commonly Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib). While the incidence of epiglottitis has diminished significantly over the years due to widespread vaccination against Hib, the proportion of epiglottitis caused by other pathogens has increased. In this report, we introduce an unseen presentation of acute epiglottitis associated with severe acute respiratory distress syndrome--coronavirus2 (SARS-CoV-2), who presented to the emergency department with throat pain and odynophagia that quickly resulted in respiratory distress. Clinicians should be aware of airway edema's concomitant presence in patients with acute epiglottitis and COVID-19 and maintain a low threshold for intubation. The rapidly progressive nature of COVID-19 and its complications may preclude intubation later on in the patient's clinical course, potentially necessitating an emergent surgical airway.","Smith, Connor; Mobarakai, Olivia; Sahra, Syeda; Twitto, Joshua; Mobarakai, Neville",IDCases,,344

This was a cross-sectional survey conducted to assess experienced discrimination, internalized stigma, shame, and mental health (anxiety, depression, distress, insomnia) among college students who merely had a perceived linkage with COVID-19, and explore the linkage between discrimination and negative mental health outcomes through the mediating effects of shame and internalized stigma. A total of 995 participants (53% female) were involved in this study, in which 40.9% of college students were reported to be discriminated against because of their experience in Wuhan. The experience of COVID-19-related discrimination is indirectly associated with anxiety, depression, and insomnia, in which shame and internalized stigma play a complete mediating effect. Meanwhile, it is both directly and indirectly associated with distress through shame and internalized stigma. The findings of this study suggest that COVID-19-related discrimination is associated with shame and internalized stigma, which in turn predict psychological symptoms over time.","Li, Hao; Zheng, Ling; Le, Hong; Zhuo, Lijun; Wu, Qian; Ma, Guoqing; Tao, Hongbing",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,344

Methods: SEIR dynamics model was used to fit daily onset infections to search the start date of this resurgent COVID-19 epidemic in Beijing. The number of cumulative infections from June 12 to July 1 in Beijing were fitted considering different levels of control strength. Results: The current reemerged COVID-19 epidemic in Beijing probably started between May 22 and May 28 (cumulative probability: 95%), with the highest probability on May 25 (23%). The R(0) of the current reemerged COVID-19 epidemic was 4.22 (95%CI: 2.88-7.02). Dynamic model fitting suggested that by June 11, the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases would reached 99 (95%CI: 77-121), which was in line with the actual situation, and without control, by July 1, the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases would reach 65 090 (95%CI: 39 068-105 037). Since June 12,comprehensive prevention and control measures have been implemented in Beijing, as of July 1,compared with uncontrolled situation, the number of infections had been reduced by 99%, similar to the fitting result of a 95% reduction of the transmission rate. The sensitivity analysis showed consistent results. Conclusions: For the emergent outbreak of COVID-19, the dynamics model can be used to infer the start time of the transmission and help tracing the source of epidemic. The comprehensive prevention and control measures taken in Beijing have quickly blocked over 95% of the transmission routes and reduced 99% of the infections, containing the sudden epidemic timely and effectively,which have value in guiding the prevention and control of the epidemic in the future.","Wei, Y Y; Guan, J X; Zhao, Y; Shen, S P; Chen, F",Zhonghua Liu Xing Bing Xue Za Zhi,,344

The aim of this study was to investigate the association between measures of screen time in adolescence and Working Memory. Data from the 1993 Pelotas (Brazil) Birth Cohort Study were analyzed (N = 3625). Self-reported screen time was collected at ages 11, 15 and 18. Working Memory performance (Digit Span backward score) was examined at age 22. Multiple linear regression was used to assess the associations between three screen time measures (television, video game and computer time) for each age and WM at age 22. We also evaluated the direct and indirect effect by mediation analysis, using the intelligence quotient (IQ) at 18 years as mediator. In men, television and video game time at 11 years and computer at ages 11 and 15 years had a positive effect on WM. Also, these effects were mediated through IQ. In women there was no significant association between screen time measures at ages 11, 15, and 18 and WM. This study provides new insights about the relationship between television, videogame, and computer time with WM in adolescents, by exploring the paths of these associations and considering the important mediating role of IQ.","Soares, Pedro San Martin; de Oliveira, Paula Duarte; Wehrmeister, Fernando César; Menezes, Ana Maria Baptista; Gonçalves, Helen",J Psychiatr Res,,344

The consumption of urban transportation fuel was analyzed and the corresponding CO2 emissions was evaluated. The changes in urban traffic volume and air pollutant concentrations before and after the outbreak of this pandemic was investigated. Due to the lockdown after the outbreak of COVID-19, the domestic consumption of motor gasoline and estimated CO2 emissions from urban vehicles in Canada has continuously decreased with a lowest level in April 2020, and rebounded in May 2020. It will still take a long time to recover to pre-pandemic levels because of the upcoming second wave of pandemic and further change. The Air Quality Health Index (AQHI), level of urban congestion and concentration level of NO2 and CO had strong relevance with the COVID-19 period while SO2 did not show significant relation.

In light of the limited data available for COVID-19-related impact on chronic pain patients, this review explores the changes in the healthcare delivery system due to social distancing and safety precautions to provide the appropriate management of chronic pain patients during the COVID-19 pandemic. Understanding both the general problems facing chronic pain patients as well as specific problems in the COVID-19 era including deconditioning, increased mental health concerns, financial burdens, and potential for medication-induced immune-suppression is vital in the appropriate management of patients. Telemedicine, the practice of caring for patients remotely when the provider and patient are not physically present with each other, is becoming increasingly used and recognized as a valuable tool to both health care providers and patients. This paper concentrates on the proper utilization of the available resources to help patients with the most severe conditions as well as the most vulnerable group. COVID-19 may be associated with a profound effect on both the health care system and patients with chronic pain. As a result, delaying, or stopping, treatment for chronic pain patients will have negative consequences, and strong pain evaluations must be administered to triage patients appropriately. Recent recommendations for the safe use of non-opioid analgesics, opioid analgesics, and interventional pain management procedures are vital to know and understand specifically during the pandemic era. Further researches are needed to identify the advance planning and rapid responses to reduce the impact of the pandemic.","El-Tallawy, Salah N; Nalamasu, Rohit; Pergolizzi, Joseph V; Gharibo, Christopher",Pain Ther,,344

On the other hand, lighting without the photocatalyst, or the photocatalyst-coat without lighting retained viral stability. Immunoblotting and electron microscopic analyses showed the reduced amounts of spike protein on the viral surface after the photocatalyst treatment. Our data suggest a possible implication of the photocatalyst on the decontamination of SARS-CoV-2 in indoor environments, thereby preventing indirect viral spread.","Uema, M.; Yonemitsu, K.; Momose, Y.; Ishii, Y.; Tateda, K.; Inoue, T.; Asakura, H.",Biocontrol Science,,344

Nationwide surveillance could benefit from using data on meat inspection findings, but several limitations need to be overcome. At the producer level, interpretation of meat inspection findings is a notable opportunity for surveillance with relevance to animal health and welfare. In this study, we propose that discovery and monitoring of relational patterns between condemnation conditions co-present in broiler batches at meat inspection can provide valuable information for surveillance of farmed animal health and welfare. RESULTS: Great Britain (GB)-based integrator meat inspection records for 14,045 broiler batches slaughtered in nine, four monthly intervals were assessed for the presence of surveillance indicators relevant to broiler health and welfare. K-means and correlation-based hierarchical clustering, and association rules analyses were performed to identify relational patterns in the data. Incidence of condemnation showed seasonal and temporal variation, which was detected by association rules analysis. Syndrome-related and non-specific relational patterns were detected in some months of meat inspection records. A potentially syndromic cluster was identified in May 2016 consisting of infection-related conditions: pericarditis, perihepatitis, peritonitis, and abnormal colour. Non-specific trends were identified in some months as an unusual combination of condemnation reasons in broiler batches. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that the detection of relational patterns in meat inspection records could provide producer-level surveillance indicators with relevance to broiler chicken health and welfare.","Buzdugan, S N; Alarcon, P; Huntington, B; Rushton, J; Blake, D P; Guitian, J",BMC Vet Res,,344

DESIGN: Rapid review with meta-analysis and narrative synthesis. METHODS: We searched databases including Embase, Medline, medRxiv and Google Scholar up to 26 August 2020 for studies describing COVID-19 outcomes in PLWH and conducted a meta-analysis of higher quality studies. RESULTS: We identified 1908 studies and included 19 in the review. In a meta-analysis of five studies, PLWH had a higher risk of COVID-19 mortality [hazard ratio 1.95, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.62-2.34] compared with people without HIV. Risk of death remained elevated for PLWH in a subgroup analysis of hospitalized cohorts (hazard ratio 1.60, 95% CI: 1.12-2.27) and studies of PLWH across all settings (hazard ratio 2.08, 95% CI: 1.69-2.56). Eight other studies assessed the association between HIV and COVID-19 outcomes, but provided inconclusive, lower quality evidence due to potential confounding and selection bias. There were insufficient data on the effect of CD4+ T-cell count and HIV viral load on COVID-19 outcomes. Eleven studies reported COVID-19 outcomes by ART-regimen. In the two largest studies, tenofovir disoproxil fumarate-based regimens were associated with a lower risk of adverse COVID-19 outcomes, although these analyses are susceptible to confounding by co-morbidities. CONCLUSION: Emerging evidence suggests a moderately increased risk of COVID-19 mortality among PLWH. Further investigation into the relationship between COVID-19 outcomes and CD4+ T-cell count, HIV viral load, ART and the use of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate is warranted.","Mellor, Maya M; Bast, Anne C; Jones, Nicholas R; Roberts, Nia W; Ordóñez-Mena, José M; Reith, Alastair J M; Butler, Christopher C; Matthews, Philippa C; Dorward, Jienchi",AIDS,,344
514054,Classification of Speech with and without Face Mask using Acoustic Features,2020-10-08,"INTRODUCTION: Monitoring of laboratory indicators is important for predicting changes in disease severity and clinical outcomes. We aimed to identify the critical predictors that can effectively assess the disease conditions of patients with COVID-19 by analyzing the clinical characteristics and laboratory findings of patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. METHODS: All consecutive patients (n = 294) with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection admitted to the General Hospital of Central Theater Command of the PLA from February 6 to February 21, 2020, were enrolled. These patients were divided into the severe group and the nonsevere group according to disease severity during hospitalization. RESULTS: The median neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) value of the severe patients was dramatically higher than that of the nonsevere patients (10.4 vs 2.6; P < .001). The NLR value equal to 5 was a boundary value worthy of reference, because more than 80% severe patients had an NLR value greater than 5 and over 80% nonsevere patients had an NLR value less than 5. The NLR value of these COVID-19 patients was positively and respectively correlated with the values of C-reactive protein (R = .5921, P < .001), lactate dehydrogenase (R = .4509, P < .001), procalcitonin (R = .5504, P < .001), fibrinogen (R = .4710, P < .001), and D-dimers (R = .4425, P < .001). However, the NLR value was merely and positively correlated with the interleukin-6 value (R = .3594, P < .05), but had no correlations with the values of interleukin-10, interleukin-4, interleukin-17, interferon-Î³, and tumor necrosis factor-&#945; (P > .05). DISCUSSION: Neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio is a critical predictor for assessment of disease severity in patients with COVID-19, and it has a close relation with the laboratory indicators related to disease conditions.","Liu, Lei; Zheng, Yaqiong; Cai, Liping; Wu, Wanlei; Tang, Shi; Ding, Yinjuan; Liu, Wanbing; Kou, Guomei; Xiong, Zhou; Wang, Shengdian; Zheng, Shangen",Int. j. lab. hematol,,344

We have used a model-based approach to explore the relative impact of alternative dosing regimens proposed in different dosing protocols for hydroxychloroquine in COVID-19. METHODS: We compared different PK exposures using Monte Carlo simulations based on a previously published population pharmacokinetic model in patients with rheumatoid arthritis, externally validated using both independent data in lupus erythematous patients and recent data in French COVID-19 patients. Clinical efficacy and safety information from COVID-19 patients treated with HCQ were used to contextualize and assess the actual clinical value of the model predictions. RESULTS: Literature and observed clinical data confirm the variability in clinical responses in COVID-19 when treated with the same fixed doses. Confounding factors were identified that should be taken into account for dose recommendation. For 80% of patients, doses higher than 800 mg day on day 1 followed by 600 mg daily on following days might not be needed for being cured. Limited adverse drug reactions have been reported so far for this dosing regimen, most often confounded by co-medications, comorbidities or underlying COVID-19 disease effects. CONCLUSION: Our results were clear, indicating the unmet need for characterization of target PK exposures to inform HCQ dosing optimization in COVID-19. Dosing optimization for HCQ in COVID-19 is still an unmet need. Efforts in this sense are a prerequisite for best benefit/risk balance.","Thémans, Pauline; Dauby, Nicolas; Schrooyen, Loïc; Lebout, Faustine; Delforge, Marc; Nasreddine, Rakan; Libois, Agnès; Payen, Marie-Christine; Konopnicki, Déborah; Wuillaume, Francoise; Lescrainier, Cecile; Verlinden, Veerle; Dogné, Jean-Michel; Hamdani, Jamila; Musuamba, Flora T",,,344

In addition to causing cardiovascular and respiratory lethal dysfunction, these viruses can cause neurodegeneration leading to neurological disorders. Review of the current scientific literature reveals the multiple neuropathies and neuronal dysfunction associated with these viruses. Here, we review the major findings of these studies and discuss the main neurological sequels and outcomes of coronavirus infections with SARS, MERS, and COVID-19. This article analyzes and discusses the main mechanisms of coronavirus-induced neurodegeneration according to the current experimental and clinical studies. Coronaviruses can damage the nerves directly through endovascular dysfunctions thereby affecting nerve structures and synaptic connections. Coronaviruses can also induce neural cell degeneration indirectly via mitochondrial dysfunction inducing oxidative stress, inflammation, and apoptosis. Thus, coronaviruses can cause neurological disorders by inducing neurovascular dysfunction affecting nerve structures and synaptic connections, and by inducing inflammation, oxidative stress, and apoptosis. While some of these mechanisms are similar to other RNA viruses, the neurotoxic mechanisms of COVID-19, MERS, and SARS-CoV viruses are unknown and need detailed clinical and experimental studies.","Gholami, Mina; Safari, Sepideh; Ulloa, Luis; Motaghinejad, Majid",J. neurovirology,,344

Chest radiography through glass walls of an isolation room is a technique that could be immensely useful in the current COVID-19 pandemic. PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to ensure quality and radiation safety while acquiring portable chest radiographs through the glass doors of isolation rooms using an adult anthropomorphic thorax phantom. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Sixteen chest radiographs were acquired utilizing different exposure factors without glass, through the smart glass, and through regular glass. Images were scored independently by 2 radiologists for quantum mottle and sharpness of anatomical structures using a 5-point Likert scale. Statistically significant differences in Likert scale scores and entrance surface dose (ESD) between images acquired without glass and through the smart and regular glass were tested. Interreader reliability was also evaluated. RESULTS: Compared with conventional radiography, equal or higher mean image quality scores (mottle and anatomical structures) were observed with the smart glass using 100 kVp at 12 mAs and 20 mAs and 125 kVp at 6.3 mAs (100 kVp at 2 mAs and 125 kVp at 3.2 mAs were used for conventional radiography observations). There was no statistically significant difference in the Likert scale scores for image quality and the entrance surface dose for radiographs acquired without glass, through the smart glass, and through regular glass. Backscatter from the smart glass was minimal at a distance of 3 m and was recorded as zero at a distance of 4 m from the x-ray tube outside an isolation room. CONCLUSIONS: Good-quality portable chest radiographs can be obtained safely through the smart glass doors of the isolation room. However, this technique does result in minor backscatter radiation. Modifications in the exposure factors (such as increasing milliampere seconds) may be required to optimize image quality while using this technique.","Rai, Archana; MacGregor, Kate; Hunt, Bryce; Gontar, Alex; Ditkofsky, Noah; Deva, Djeven; Mathur, Shobhit",Invest. radiol,,344

This review aimed to systematically identify measures of upper body strength, coordination and range of motion impairments that meet the requirements for use in evidence-based classification systems in wheelchair sports. Three electronic databases were searched from 2003 until 31 August 2019 for studies that assessed upper body function of participants and used a measurement tool that assessed strength, coordination or range of motion. The body of evidence for each identified measure was appraised using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation framework. Twenty-three studies were included: ten measured strength and coordination, and six measured range of motion. There was ""moderate"" confidence in using isometric strength for assessing strength impairment. Tapping tasks for the assessment of coordination impairment received a ""low"" confidence rating. All other identified measures of coordination and range of motion impairment received a ""very low"" confidence rating. Several potential measures were identified for assessing upper body strength, coordination and range of motion impairments. Further research is warranted to investigate their use for classification in Paralympic wheelchair sports.","Hutchinson, Michael J; Phillips, Jamie-Lee K; Mason, Barry S; Goosey-Tolfrey, Victoria L; Beckman, Emma M",J Sports Sci,,344
515462,Prospects for the Uk Economy,2020,"The high infectivity and severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection (COVID-19), and our limited understanding of the biology of the novel coronavirus, as well as the lack of an effective treatment for COVID-19, have created a global pandemic. Those most likely to become seriously ill with COVID-19 are adults, especially the elderly and those who are already weak or sick. At present, a specific drug for treatment of COVID-19 has not been developed. This, combined with the typical coexistence of a variety of chronic diseases in elderly patients, makes treatment challenging at present. In addition, for elderly patients, COVID-19 isolation measures during the epidemic can easily lead to psychological problems. Thus, how to manage elderly patients has become a focus of social attention in the current circumstances. This article reviews the effects of COVID-19 and makes management suggestions for elderly patients during this epidemic period. In addition to the elderly, critically ill people are also highly susceptible to this novel coronavirus. For elderly COVID-19 patients, antiviral therapy, immune regulation, and even auxiliary respiratory therapy can be given after a comprehensive evaluation of the disease. With the approval and use of COVID-19 vaccines, it is reasonable to expect that we can conquer SARS-CoV-2.","Li, Qiaoyun; Zhao, Chengyu",Med Sci Monit,,344

We describe the development of an interdisciplinary rapid message testing model to quickly create, test, and share messages with public health officials for use in health campaigns and policy briefings. METHODS: An interdisciplinary research team from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill assembled in March 2020 to assist the state health department in developing evidence-based messages to influence social distancing behaviors in the state. We developed and iteratively executed a rapid message testing model; the components of the 4-step model were message creation, survey development, survey administration, and analysis and presentation to health department officials. The model was executed 4 times, each during a 7-day period in April and May, and each subsequent survey included new phrasing and/or messaging informed by the previous week's survey. A total of 917 adults from North Carolina participated in the 4 surveys. RESULTS: Survey participants rated messages focused on protecting oneself and others higher than messages focused on norms and fear-based approaches. Pairing behaviors with motivations increased participants' desire to social distance across all themes and subgroups. For example, adding ""Protect your grandmother, your neighbor with cancer, and your best friend with asthma,"" to messaging received a 0.9-point higher score than the base message, ""Stay 6 feet apart from others when out in public."" PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: Our model to promote social distancing in North Carolina during the COVID-19 pandemic can be used for rapid, iterative message testing during public health emergencies.","Bartels, Sophia M; Gora Combs, Katherine; Lazard, Allison J; Shelus, Victoria; Davis, C Hunter; Rothschild, Allison; Drewry, Maura; Carpenter, Kathryn; Newman, Emily; Goldblatt, Allison; Dasgupta, Nabarun; Hill, Lauren M; Ribisl, Kurt M",Public Health Rep,,344
517155,Beyond Fairness Metrics: Roadblocks and Challenges for Ethical AI in Practice,2021-08-11,"The rapid spread of SARS-CoV-2 has induced a global pandemic. Severe forms of COVID-19 are characterized by dysregulated immune response and ""cytokine storm"". The role of IgG and IgM antibodies in COVID-19 pathology is reasonably well studied, whereas IgA is neglected. To improve clinical outcome of patients, immune modulatory drugs appear to be beneficial. Such drugs include intravenous immunoglobulin preparations, which were successfully tested in severe COVID-19 patients. Here we established a versatile in vitro model to study inflammatory as well as anti-inflammatory processes by therapeutic human immunoglobulins. We dissect the inflammatory activation on neutrophil-like HL60 cells, using an immune complex consisting of latex beads coated with spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 and opsonized with specific immunoglobulins from convalescent plasma. Our data clarifies the role of Fc-receptor-dependent phagocytosis via IgA-Fc&#945;RI and IgG-FcÎ³R for COVID-19 disease followed by cytokine release. We show that COVID-19 associated inflammation could be reduced by addition of human immunoglobulin preparations (IVIG and trimodulin), while trimodulin elicits stronger immune modulation by more powerful ITAMi signaling. Besides IgG, the IgA component of trimodulin in particular, is of functional relevance for immune modulation in this assay setup, highlighting the need to study IgA mediated immune response.","Bohländer, Fabian; Riehl, Dennis; Weißmüller, Sabrina; Gutscher, Marcus; Schüttrumpf, Jörg; Faust, Stefanie",Front Immunol,,344

Since effective educational strategies are required to enhance nursing students' competency in clinical practice, this study sought to evaluate the effectiveness of simulation problem-based learning (S-PBL). A quasi-experimental control group pretest-post-test design was used. Nursing students were allocated randomly to the control group (n = 31) and the experimental group (n = 47). Students in the control group participated in a traditional maternity clinical practicum for a week, while students in the experimental group participated S-PBL for a week. The students in the experimental group were trained in small groups using a childbirth patient simulator (Gaumard® Noelle® S554.100, Miami, USA) based on a standardized scenario related to obstetric care. The students' learning attitude, metacognition, and critical thinking were then measured via a self-reported questionnaire. Compared with the control group, the pre-post difference in learning attitude and critical thinking increased significantly (p < 0.01) in the experimental group. S-PBL was found to be an effective strategy for improving nursing students' learning transfer. Thus, S-PBL that reflects various clinical situations is recommended to improve the training in maternal health nursing.","Son, Hae Kyoung",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,344

518946,Two critical times for the SIR model,2020-09-21,"Sepsis is a life-threatening clinical condition demanding accurate and rapid diagnosis of the culprit pathogen, thereby to improve prognosis. Pathogen determination through blood culture is the gold standard for diagnosis but has limitations due to low sensitivity. Recently, circulating DNAs derived from pathogenic organisms were found in the plasma of patients with sepsis and were further proved to be more sensitive biomarkers for the diagnosis of the pathogen origin in sepsis. However, the fundamental molecular characteristics of circulating DNA in patients with sepsis remain unclear. Here, we used specific PCR and Sanger sequencing to verify the microbiology culture results via the corresponding plasma circulating DNA. We analyzed the composition and molecular characteristics of circulating DNA in septic patients using next-generation sequencing technology. We showed the presence of pathogen-derived circulating DNA in the plasma of patients with sepsis. The sizes of circulating DNA fragments derived from pathogenic bacteria showed a skewed unimodal distribution, while those derived from host cells showed a normal unimodal distribution. Lengths of fragments at peak concentration for both origins ranged from 150 bp to 200 bp, and reads mapping to pathogenic bacteria genome distributed uniformly on the reference. Our findings have improved our understanding of microbial circulating DNA in patients with sepsis as a potential methodology for the accurate diagnosis of sepsis, especially in light of an urgent need for such a diagnosis associated with the COVID-19 infection.","Liao, Wei; Zuo, Xiaoyu; Lin, Guowang; Zhou, Yaqing; Fu, Yonghong; Cai, Shaohang; Wei, Pan-Pan; Liu, Yu-Xiang; Liu, Yang; Ma, Gang; Bei, Jin-Xin",Discov Med,,344

This may be a unique opportunity to promote and expand alternative models of health-care delivery in patients undergoing renal replacement therapies. SUMMARY: Despite the high risk of acquiring communicable diseases when undergoing in-centre treatments, only a small proportion of patients are currently being treated with home therapies. Recent data provided by the Italian Society of Nephrology (SIN), the REIN French Registry and the Wuhan Hemodialysis Quality Control Center clearly show that patients receiving hospital-based treatment have a 3- to 4-fold greater risk of infection, and a subsequent fatality proportion between 21 and 34%. On the other hand, home-based therapy can be managed remotely, there is little or no need for transport to and from the hospital, and it is less expensive. Besides, the digital revolution in health care with the development of virtual care systems can make home dialysis with telehealth a cost-effective solution for both patients and health-care providers. Such a transition would require specific training for physicians and health-care professionals and a functional re-organization of dialysis centres to improve the skills and expertise in caring for patients at home. CONCLUSION: The need for more widespread home treatment is the main lesson learnt by nephrologists by the COVID-19 pandemic.","Brunori, Giuliano; Reboldi, Gianpaolo; Aucella, Filippo",Kidney Blood Press Res,,344

Among the main causes are exposure during the care of suspected patients and asymptomatic patients, which caused a greater lack of protection in some cases, and to the global shortage of personal protective equipment due to the strong demand for it. The main objective of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of a teleconsultation protocol with patients who had respiratory symptoms in the reduction of the consumption of personal protective equipment (PPE) in a hospital emergency service (HES) during the COVID-19 pandemic. This is a descriptive and retrospective study that analyzes the implementation of a teleconsultation protocol with patients with respiratory problems treated in the HES at the Hospital de Poniente (Almeria), between 18 March and 30 April 2020. In the selected study period, 5353 patients were treated in the HES of the Hospital de Poniente; of these, 15.43% showed respiratory symptoms and were referred to the Respiratory Circuit, of which 42.2% did so via teleconsultation. Sixty-six cases of COVID-19 were diagnosed, 57.6% were male, and the median age was 71 years old. The main disease related was pneumonia (89.4%), symptoms more frequent were cough (77.3%), fever (77.3%), and dyspnea (60.6%). Lastly, 56.1% of the patients that attended had one or more comorbidities, high blood pressure (53%), and diabetes (36.4%), which became the main risk factors. The results showed that the implementation of teleconsultation in the HES reduced the possibility of infection and allowed for a more efficient consumption of personal protective equipment.","Lopez-Villegas, Antonio; Maroto-Martin, Salvador; Baena-Lopez, Miguel Angel; Garzon-Miralles, Antonio; Bautista-Mesa, Rafael Jesús; Peiro, Salvador; Leal-Costa, Cesar",,,344

In this study, we evaluated a series of molecules based on the plant (Cedrus deodara) derived &#945;,ß,Î³-Himachalenes scaffolds. RESULTS: The results obtained from estimated affinity and ligand efficiency suggested that BCH10, BCH15, BCH16, and BCH17 could act as potential inhibitors of Nsp1. Moreover, MD simulations comprising various MD driven time-dependent analyses and thermodynamic free energy calculations also suggested stable protein-ligand complexes and strong interactions with the binding site. Furthermore, the selected molecules passed drug likeliness parameters and the physiochemical property analysis showed acceptable bioactivity scores. CONCLUSION: The structural parameters of dynamic simulations revealed that the reported molecules could act as lead compounds against SARS-CoV-2 Nsp1 protein.","Singh, Rahul; Bhardwaj, Vijay Kumar; Das, Pralay; Purohit, Rituraj",Comput Biol Med,,344

However, altered inflammatory responses can contribute to disease in infected individuals. Many endogenous mediators that drive the resolution of inflammation are now known. Overall, mediators of resolution tend to decrease inflammatory responses and provide normal or greater ability of the host to deal with infection. In the lung, it seems that pro-resolution molecules, or strategies that promote their increase, tend to suppress inflammation and lung injury and facilitate control of bacterial or viral burden. Here, we argue that the demonstrated anti-inflammatory, pro-resolving, anti-thrombogenic and anti-microbial effects of such endogenous mediators of resolution may be useful in the treatment of the late stages of the disease in patients with COVID-19.","Sousa, Lirlândia P; Pinho, Vanessa; Teixeira, Mauro M",Br. j. pharmacol,,344

METHODS: In this retrospective study, 301 pneumonic lesions (150 ground-glass opacity [GGO], 52 crazy paving [CP], 99 consolidation) obtained from nonenhanced thorax CT scans of 74 AP (46 male and 28 female; 48.25±13.67 years) and 60 COVID-19 (39 male and 21 female; 48.01±20.38 years) patients were segmented manually by two independent radiologists, and Location, Size, Shape, and First- and Second-order radiomics features were calculated. RESULTS: Multiple parameters showed significant differences between AP and COVID-19-related GGOs and consolidations, although only the Range parameter was significantly different for CPs. Models developed by using the Bayesian information criterion (BIC) for the whole group of GGO and consolidation lesions predicted COVID-19 consolidation and AP GGO lesions with low accuracy (46.1% and 60.8%, respectively). Thus, instead of subjective classification, lesions were reclassified according to their skewness into positive skewness group (PSG, 78 AP and 71 COVID-19 lesions) and negative skewness group (NSG, 56 AP and 44 COVID-19 lesions), and group-specific models were created. The best AUC, accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity were respectively 0.774, 75.8%, 74.6%, and 76.9% among the PSG models and 0.907, 83%, 79.5%, and 85.7% for the NSG models. The best PSG model was also better at predicting NSG lesions smaller than 3 mL. Using an algorithm, 80% of COVID-19 and 81.1% of AP patients were correctly predicted.

523483,Finding a role for AI in the pandemic,2020,"This study examined core belief violation and meaning making as mechanisms mediating the relationship between adherence to social isolation policies for mitigating coronavirus transmission and reduced coronavirus anxiety (CA). Adherence to social isolation policies (social distancing, sheltering in place, and cessation of long-distance travel), use of nonsocial precautionary measures (handwashing, wearing a mask), core belief violation, meaning made of the COVID pandemic, and CA were assessed in a sample of 408 North Americans. Process analysis revealed that adhering to social isolation policies predicted lower levels of CA and that this effect was largely mediated by conservation of core beliefs (e.g., in predictability, control, and self-agency) and ability to make meaning of the pandemic. In contrast, exclusive reliance on nonsocial protections such as handwashing and mask wearing was associated with high levels of CA. These results suggest that social isolation policies support the integrity of adherents' meaning systems, thereby mitigating distress, which carries useful implications for both policy and psychological intervention.","Milman, Evgenia; Lee, Sherman A; Neimeyer, Robert A",Death Stud,,344
523544,"Overview of US Domestic Response to the 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) [February 10, 2020]",2020,"BACKGROUND: The outcomes of large-sized graft mismatch in deceased donor liver transplantation (LT) have been rarely studied. The aim of this study was to determine whether a large-sized graft for recipient influenced the post-transplant outcomes. METHODS: A total of 273 patients undergoing LT were enrolled and divided into a large and a normal-sized graft group by graft weight to recipient weight (GWRW) >2.5% (n = 76) or GWRW &#8804;2.5% (n = 197). Post-operative complications and outcomes were retrospectively analysed. RESULTS: The two groups were comparable in demographic characteristics. The rate of complications was significantly higher in the large-sized graft group including early allograft dysfunction (36.8% versus 17.8%, P = 0.001), hepatic necrosis (26.3% versus 13.7%, P = 0.01) and massive hydrothorax (25% versus 14.7%, P = 0.04). The large-sized graft group suffered higher early mortality compared with the normal-sized graft group (30 days: 14.5% versus 5.6%, P = 0.02, 90 days: 21.1% versus 9.6%, P = 0.01). The primary causes of early death were multiple organ failure (10.5% versus 2%, P = 0.002) and sepsis (2.6% versus 1.5%, P = 0.54). Four parameters including donor alanine transaminase, GWRW, estimated blood loss and model for end-stage liver disease score were significant on multivariate analysis, and indicated significant risk factors for the early mortality of recipients. CONCLUSION: In deceased donor LT, GWRW >2.5% is associated with increased liver injury, risk of early mortality and other adverse outcomes. Thus, donor livers should be allocated to recipients with GWRW &#8804;2.5%.","Shen, Zhenhua; Wang, Zhize; Jiang, Yuancong; Wu, Tianchun; Zheng, Shusen",ANZ j. Surg,,344

With the development of chemotherapy, there has been a substantial increase in the overall survival rate in the last 30 years. However, the overall mortality rate in children with cancer remains 25%, and many survivors experience a decline in overall quality of life and long-term adverse effects caused by treatments. Although cancer cells share common characteristics, pediatric cancers are different from adult cancers in their prevalence, mutation load, and drug response. Therefore, there is an urgent unmet need to develop therapeutic approaches specifically designed for children with cancer. Nanotechnology can potentially overcome the deficiencies of conventional methods of administering chemotherapy and ultimately improve clinical outcomes. The nanoparticle-based drug delivery systems can decrease the toxicity of therapy, provide a sustained or controlled drug release, improve the pharmacokinetic properties of loading contents, and achieve a targeted drug delivery with achievable modifications. Furthermore, therapeutic approaches based on combining nanoformulated drugs with novel immunotherapeutic agents are emerging. In this review, we discussed the recently developed nanotechnology-based strategies for treating blood and solid pediatric cancers.","Yang, Shicheng; Wallach, Mia; Krishna, Apurva; Kurmasheva, Raushan; Sridhar, Srinivas",J Clin Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33916177/; https://doi.org/10.3390/jcm10071437,344

Robustness of this method is verified by numerical experiments with both artificial and stock returns series. Results show that the proposed W-MFSMXA method not only keep the multifractal structure unchanged, but contains more significant information of series compared to the previous MFSMXA method. Furthermore, analytic formulas of the binomial multifractal model are generated for W-MFSMXA. Theoretical analysis and finite-size effect test demonstrate that W-MFSMXA slightly outperforms MFSMXA for relatively shorter series. We further generate the scaling exponent ratio to describe the relation of two methods, whose profile is found approximating a centrosymmetric hyperbola. Cross-multifractality is found in returns series but then destroyed after being shuffled as a consequence of the removed long memory in separate series.","Xiong, Hui; Shang, Pengjian",Commun Nonlinear Sci Numer Simul,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1007570415002373; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cnsns.2015.06.029; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32288420/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1007570415002373,344
590051,Herausforderungen für Mannschafts- und Verbandsärzte in Zeiten der COVID-19-Pandemie,2021-08-25,"The recent pandemic of coronavirus infectious illness 2019 (COVID19) triggered by SARS-CoV-2 has rapidly spread around the globe, generating in severe events an acute, highly lethal pneumonia and death. In the past two hitherto similar CoVs, the severe acute respiratory syndrome CoV (SARS-CoV-1) and Middle East respiratory syndrome CoV (MERS-CoV) also gained universal attention as they produced clinical symptoms similar to those of SARS-CoV-2 utilizing angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor and dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) to go into the cells. COVID-19 may also present with overtly neurological symptoms. The proper understanding of the expression and dissemination of ACE2 in central and peripheral nerve systems is crucial to understand better the neurological morbidity caused by COVID-19. Using the STRING bioinformatic tool and references through text mining tools associated to Coronaviruses, we identified SAMHD1 as the probable link to neurological symptoms. Paralleled to the response to influenza A virus and, specifically, respiratory syncytial virus, SARS-CoV-2 evokes a response that needs robust induction of a subclass of cytokines, including the Type I and, obviously, Type III interferons as well as a few chemokines. We correlate ACE2 to the pathogenesis and neurologic complications of COVID-19 and found that SAMHD1 links to NF-κB pathway. No correlation was found with other molecules associated with Coronavirus infection, including ADAR, BST2, IRF3, IFITM3, ISG15, MX1, MX2, RNASEL, RSAD2, and VPRBP. We suggest that SAMHD1 is the molecule that may be behind the mechanisms of the neurological complications associated with COVID-19.","Khan, Aiza; Sergi, Consolato",Front Neurol,https://doi.org/10.3389/fneur.2020.562913; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33101175/,344
590427,Detection of COVID-19 Infection from Routine Blood Exams with Machine Learning: A Feasibility Study,2020-07-01,"BACKGROUND: Various supra-molecular structures form by self-assembly of proteins in a symmetric fashion. Examples of such structures are viruses, some bacterial micro-compartments and eukaryotic vaults. Peptide/protein-based nanoparticles are emerging in synthetic biology for a variety of biomedical applications, mainly as drug targeting and delivery systems or as vaccines. Our self-assembling peptide nanoparticles (SAPNs) are formed by a single peptide chain that consists of two helical coiled-coil segments connected by a short linker region. One helix is forming a pentameric coiled coil while the other is forming a trimeric coiled coil. RESULTS: Here, we were studying in vitro and in silico the effect of the chain length and of point mutations near the linker region between the pentamer and the trimer on the self-assembly of the SAPNs. 60 identical peptide chains co-assemble to form a spherical nanoparticle displaying icosahedral symmetry. We have stepwise reduced the size of the protein chain to a minimal chain length of 36 amino acids. We first used biochemical and biophysical methods on the longer constructs followed by molecular dynamics simulations to study eleven different smaller peptide constructs. We have identified one peptide that shows the most promising mini-nanoparticle model in silico. CONCLUSIONS: An approach of in silico modeling combined with in vitro testing and verification yielded promising peptide designs: at a minimal chain length of only 36 amino acids they were able to self-assemble into proper nanoparticles. This is important since the production cost increases more than linearly with chain length. Also the size of the nanoparticles is significantly smaller than 20 nm, thus reducing the immunogenicity of the particles, which in turn may allow to use the SAPNs as drug delivery systems without the risk of an anaphylactic shock.

590997,Mate Availability and Sexual Disgust,2021-05-13,"This paper presents a study of early epidemiological assessment of COVID-19 transmission dynamics in Indonesia. The aim is to quantify heterogeneity in the numbers of secondary infections. To this end, we estimate the basic reproduction number [Formula: see text] and the overdispersion parameter [Formula: see text] at two regions in Indonesia: Jakarta–Depok and Batam. The method to estimate [Formula: see text] is based on a sequential Bayesian method, while the parameter [Formula: see text] is estimated by fitting the secondary case data with a negative binomial distribution. Based on the first 1288 confirmed cases collected from both regions, we find a high degree of individual-level variation in the transmission. The basic reproduction number [Formula: see text] is estimated at 6.79 and 2.47, while the overdispersion parameter [Formula: see text] of a negative-binomial distribution is estimated at 0.06 and 0.2 for Jakarta–Depok and Batam, respectively. This suggests that superspreading events played a key role in the early stage of the outbreak, i.e., a small number of infected individuals are responsible for large numbers of COVID-19 transmission. This finding can be used to determine effective public measures, such as rapid isolation and identification, which are critical since delay of diagnosis is the most common cause of superspreading events.","Hasan, Agus; Susanto, Hadi; Kasim, Muhammad Firmansyah; Nuraini, Nuning; Lestari, Bony; Triany, Dessy; Widyastuti, Widyastuti",Sci Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33372191/; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-79352-5,344
591585,Spatiotemporal blocking of the bouncy particle sampler for efficient inference in state-space models,2021-09-01,"BACKGROUND: Viruses are obligate parasites that depend on the cellular machinery of the host to regenerate and manufacture their proteins. Most antiviral drugs on the market today target viral proteins. However, the more recent strategies involve targeting the host cell proteins or pathways that mediate viral replication. This new approach would be effective for most viruses while minimizing drug resistance and toxicity. METHODS: Cytomegalovirus replication, latency, and immune response are mediated by the intermediate early protein 2, the main protein that determines the effectiveness of drugs in cytomegalovirus inhibition. This review explains how intermediate early protein 2 can modify the action of cyclosporin A, an immunosuppressive, and antiviral drug. It also links all the pathways mediated by cyclosporin A, cytomegalovirus replication, and its encoded proteins. RESULTS: Intermediate early protein 2 can influence the cellular cyclophilin A pathway, affecting cyclosporin A as a mediator of viral replication or anti-cytomegalovirus drug. CONCLUSION: Cyclosporin A has a dual function in cytomegalovirus pathogenesis. It has the immunosuppressive effect that establishes virus replication through the inhibition of T-cell function. It also has an anti-cytomegalovirus effect mediated by intermediate early protein 2. Both of these functions involve cyclophilin A pathway.","A Abdullah, Ashwaq; Abdullah, Rasedee; A Nazariah, Zeenathul; N Balakrishnan, Krishnan; Firdaus J Abdullah, Faez; A Bala, Jamilu; Mohd-Lila, Mohd-Azmi",Antivir Chem Chemother,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30449131/; https://doi.org/10.1177/2040206618811413,344

DESIGN: We conducted a cross-sectional online survey in July 2020. We included predictors informed by previous research, in the following categories: sociodemographic variables; uptake of influenza vaccine last winter and beliefs about vaccination. PARTICIPANTS: 570 participants (mean age: 53.07; 56.3% female, 87.0% white) who were eligible for the free seasonal influenza vaccination in the UK. RESULTS: 59.7% of our sample indicated they were likely to have the seasonal influenza vaccination, 22.1% reported being unlikely to have the vaccination and 18.2% were unsure. We used logistic regression to investigate variables associated with intention to receive a seasonal influenza vaccine in the 2020–2021 season. A positive attitude to vaccination in general predicted intention to have the influenza vaccine in 2020–2021 (OR 1.45, 95% CI 1.19 to 1.77, p<0.001) but the strongest predictor of intention was previous influenza vaccination behaviour (OR 278.58, 95% CI 78.04 to 994.46, p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Previous research suggests that increasing uptake of the influenza vaccination may help contain a COVID-19 outbreak, so steps need to be taken to convert intention into behaviour and to reach those individuals who reported being unlikely or unsure about having the vaccine.","Sherman, Susan M; Sim, Julius; Amlôt, Richard; Cutts, Megan; Dasch, Hannah; Rubin, G James; Sevdalis, Nick; Smith, Louise E",BMJ Open,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34257095/; https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2021-049369,344

The rapidity and highly communicable nature of the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak has hampered the design and execution of definitive randomized, controlled trials of therapy outside of the clinic or hospital. In the absence of clinical trial results, physicians must use what has been learned about the pathophysiology of SARS-CoV-2 infection in determining early outpatient treatment of the illness with the aim of preventing hospitalization or death. This paper outlines key pathophysiological principles that relate to the patient with early infection treated at home. Therapeutic approaches based on these principles include: 1) reduction of reinoculation, 2) combination antiviral therapy, 3) immunomodulation, 4) antiplatelet/antithrombotic therapy 5) administration of oxygen, monitoring, and telemedicine. Future randomized trials testing the principles and agents discussed in this paper will undoubtedly refine and clarify their individual roles, however we emphasize the immediate need for management guidance in the setting of widespread hospital resource consumption, morbidity, and mortality.","McCullough, Peter A.; Kelly, Ronan J.; Ruocco, Gaetano; Lerma, Edgar; Tumlin, James; Wheelan, Kevin; Katz, Nevin; Lepor, Norman E.; Vijay, Kris; Carter, Harvey; Singh, Bhupinder; McCullough, Sean P.; Bhambi, Brijesh K.; Palazzuoli, Alberto; De Ferrari, Gaetano M; Milligan, Gregory; Safder, Taimur; Tecson, Kristen M.; Wang, Dee Dee; McKinnon; O'Neill, William W.; Zervos, Marcus; Risch, Harvey A.",Am J Med,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0002934320306732?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0002934320306732; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32771461/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.amjmed.2020.07.003,344

But little is known regarding how to support Latino fathers in health promotion within their family systems, specifically for Latino families living in border communities. Program development was embedded in a larger community-based grant and part of a longstanding academic-community collaboration. An interdisciplinary research team applied theories related to health behavior, family systems, behavior change, and community engagement to develop a father-focused and family-centered behavioral program for Mexican-heritage fathers and children living near the Texas-Mexico border to support changes in nutrition and physical activity at the individual and family levels. Promotoras de salud (trained community health workers) delivered the program through group sessions, check-in calls, and at-home activities. Group session activities were designed to engage family triads and dyads using experiential education related to nutrition and physical activity, like cooking lessons and active play, over a six-week period. Future research can use the program approach and curricula as a roadmap for designing context-specific and culturally-relevant programs for Latino families. Additional research is needed to explore how approaches like this can support families and their health goals.","Johnson, Cassandra M.; Sharkey, Joseph R.; Umstattd Meyer, M.

The objective of this quasi-experimental study was to determine whether bolus vitamin D3 supplementation taken during or just before COVID-19 was effective in improving survival among frail elderly nursing-home residents with COVID-19. Sixty-six residents with COVID-19 from a French nursing-home were included in this quasi-experimental study. The “Intervention group” was defined as those having received bolus vitamin D3 supplementation during COVID-19 or in the preceding month, and the “Comparator group” corresponded to all other participants. The primary and secondary outcomes were COVID-19 mortality and Ordinal Scale for Clinical Improvement (OSCI) score in acute phase, respectively. Age, gender, number of drugs daily taken, functional abilities, albuminemia, use of corticosteroids and/or hydroxychloroquine and/or antibiotics (i.e., azithromycin or rovamycin), and hospitalization for COVID-19 were used as potential confounders. The Intervention (n = 57; mean ± SD, 87.7 ± 9.3years; 79%women) and Comparator (n = 9; mean,87.4 ± 7.2years; 67%women) groups were comparable at baseline, as were the COVID-19 severity and the use of dedicated COVID-19 drugs. The mean follow-up time was 36 ± 17days. 82.5% of participants in the Intervention group survived COVID-19, compared to only 44.4% in the Comparator group (P = 0.023). The full-adjusted hazard ratio for mortality according to vitamin D3 supplementation was HR = 0.11[95%CI:0.03;0.48],P = 0.003.

The role of multi-organ failure during ICU admission as driver for outcome remains to be investigated yet. DESIGN AND SETTING: Prospective cohort of mechanically ventilated critically ill with SARS-CoV-2 infection. PARTICIPANTS AND METHODS: 94 participants of the MaastrICCht cohort (21% women) had a median length of stay of 16 days (maximum of 77). After division into survivors (n = 59) and non-survivors (n = 35), we analysed 1555 serial SOFA scores using linear mixed-effects models. RESULTS: Survivors improved one SOFA score point more per 5 days (95% CI: 4–8) than non-survivors. Adjustment for age, sex, and chronic lung, renal and liver disease, body-mass index, diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular risk factors, and Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score did not change this result. This association was stronger for women than men (P-interaction = 0.043). CONCLUSIONS: The decrease in SOFA score associated with survival suggests multi-organ failure involvement during mechanical ventilation in patients with SARS-CoV-2.

594416,Siberian environmental change: Synthesis of recent studies and opportunities for networking,2021-09-29,"Background The District of Columbia (DC), a major metropolitan area, continues to see community transmission of SARS CoV 2. While serologic testing does not indicate current SARS CoV 2 infection, it can indicate prior infection and help inform local policy and health guidance. The DC Department of Health (DC Health) conducted a community based survey to estimate DC SARS CoV 2 seroprevalence and identify seropositivity associated factors. Methods A mixed-methods cross-sectional serology survey was conducted among a convenience sample of DC residents during July 27 through August 21, 2020. Free serology testing was offered at three public test sites. Participants completed an electronic questionnaire on household and demographic characteristics, COVID like illness (CLI) since January 1, 2020, comorbidities, and SARS-CoV-2 exposures. Univariate and bivariate analyses were conducted to describe the sample population and assess factors associated with seropositivity. Results Among a sample of 671 participants, 51 individuals were seropositive, yielding an estimated seroprevalence of 7.6%. More than half (56.9%) of the seropositive participants reported no prior CLI; nearly half (47.1%) had no prior SARS-CoV-2 testing. Race/ethnicity, prior SARS-CoV-2 testing, prior CLI, employment status, and contact with confirmed COVID-19 cases were associated with seropositivity (P<0.05). Among those reporting prior CLI, loss of taste or smell, duration of CLI, fewer days between CLI and serology test, or prior viral test were associated with seropositivity (P[≤]0.006). Conclusions These findings indicate many seropositive individuals reported no symptoms consistent with CLI since January or any prior SARS-CoV-2 testing. This underscores the potential for cases to go undetected in the community and suggests wider-spread transmission than previously reported in DC.","Sherman, A.; Reuben, J.; David, N.

This study was designed to determine the longitudinal seroprevalence of specific immunglobolin-G (IgG)-antibodies in employees in a hospital setting. Methods All employees including healthcare and non-healthcare workers in a secondary care hospital were invited to participate in this single-center study. After an initial screening, a 6 months follow-up was done which included serological examination for SARS-CoV-2-IgG-antibodies and a questionnaire for self-reported symptoms, self-perception and thoughts about the local and national hygiene and pandemic plans. Results The seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2-IgG-antibodies was 0.74% among 406 hospital employees (95% confidence interval) (0.75% in healthcare workers, 0.72% in non-healthcare workers), initially recruited in April 2020, in their follow-up blood specimen in October 2020. In this study, 30.54% of the participants reported using the official German corona mobile application and the majority were content with the local and national rules in relation to Coronavirus restrictions. Discussion At the 6 months follow-up, the 0.74% seroprevalence was below the reported seroprevalence of 1.35% in the general German population. The prevalence in healthcare workers in direct patient care compared with those without direct patient contact did not differ significantly.","Herzberg, J.; Vollmer, T.; Fischer, B.; Becher, H.; Becker, A.-K.; Sahly, H.; Honarpisheh, H.; Guraya, S.

597330,A Topical Collection on ICT for Health Science Research – EFMI Special Topic Conference,2021-05-17,"BACKGROUND: The outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic caused great uncertainty about causes, treatment and mortality of the new virus. Constant updates of recommendations and restrictions from national authorities may have caused great concern for pregnant women. Reports suggested an increased number of pregnant women choosing to give birth at home, some even unassisted (‘freebirth’) due to concerns of transmission in hospital or reduction in birthplace options. During April and May 2020, we aimed to investigate i) the level of concern about coronavirus transmission in Danish pregnant women, ii) the level of concern related to changes in maternity services due to the pandemic, and iii) implications for choice of place of birth. METHODS: We conducted a nationwide cross-sectional online survey study, inviting all registered pregnant women in Denmark (n = 30,009) in April and May 2020. RESULTS: The response rate was 60% (n = 17,995). Concerns of transmission during pregnancy and birth were considerable; 63% worried about getting severely ill whilst pregnant, and 55% worried that virus would be transmitted to their child. Thirtyeight percent worried about contracting the virus at the hospital. The most predominant concern related to changes in maternity services during the pandemic was restrictions on partners’ attendance at birth (81%). Especially nulliparous women were concerned about whether cancelled antenatal classes or fewer physical midwifery consultations would affect their ability to give birth or care for their child postpartum.. The proportion of women who considered a home birth was equivalent to pre-pandemic home birth rates in Denmark (3%). During the temporary discontinue of public home birth services, 18% of this group considered a home birth assisted by a private midwife (n = 125), and 6% considered a home birth with no midwifery assistance at all (n = 41). CONCLUSION: Danish pregnant womens’ concerns about virus transmission to the unborn child and worries about contracting the virus during hospital appointments were considerable during the early pandemic. Home birth rates may not be affected by the pandemic, but restrictions in home birth services may impose decisions to freebirth for a small proportion of the population.","Schrøder, Katja; Stokholm, Lonny; Rubin, Katrine Hass; Jørgensen, Jan Stener; Nohr, Ellen Aagaard; Petersen, Lone Kjeld; Bliddal, Mette",BMC Pregnancy Childbirth,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34592953/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12884-021-04108-6,344

598343,Artificial intelligence in medical devices and clinical decision support systems,2019-12-06,"Aims To describe the psychological impact of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) on health care workers in a regional general hospital 2 months post-outbreak. Method Doctors and nurses were encouraged to participate. The survey consisted of self-report measures: demographics, the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ) 28 and Impact of Events Scale (IES). A questionnaire enquiring about changes in life's priorities due to SARS and circumstances that helped with coping was used. Participation was strictly voluntary and responses anonymous. Results In total 177 out of 661 (27%) participants [40 out of 113 (35%) doctors and 137 out of 544 (25%) nurses] had a GHQ 28 score ≥5. Doctors [P = 0.026, odds ratio (OR) = 1.6 and 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.1–2.5] and single health care workers were at higher risk (P = 0.048, OR = 1.4 and 95% CI = 1.02–2.0) compared to nurses and those who were married. Approximately 20% of the participants had IES scores ≥30, indicating the presence of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Four areas were classified as more important using factor analysis: health and relationship with the family, relationship with friends/colleagues, work and spiritual. The areas for coping strategies were clear directives/precautionary measures, ability to give feedback to/obtain support from management, support from supervisors/colleagues, support from the family, ability to talk to someone and religious convictions. Support from supervisors/colleagues was a significant negative predictor for psychiatric symptoms and PTSD. Work and clear communication of directives/precautionary measures also helped reduce psychiatric symptoms. Conclusions Many health care workers were emotionally affected and traumatized during the SARS outbreak. Hence, it is important for health care institutions to provide psychosocial support and intervention for their health care workers.","Chan, Angelina O.

Accepted manuscripts have been peer-reviewed and copyedited, but are posted online before technical formatting and author proofing. These manuscripts are not the final version of record and will be replaced with the final article (formatted per AJHP style and proofed by the authors) at a later time. PURPOSE: This article reviews the efficacy and safety of revefenacin, the first once-daily, long-acting muscarinic antagonist, when delivered via a standard jet nebulizer in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). SUMMARY: Revefenacin 175 µg is indicated for the maintenance treatment of patients with moderate to very severe COPD. Preclinical studies showed that revefenacin is a potent and selective antagonist with similar affinity for the different subtypes of muscarinic receptor (M1-M5). Furthermore, prevention of methacholine- and acetylcholine-induced bronchoconstrictive effects was dose dependent and lasted longer than 24 hours, demonstrating a long duration of action. In phase 2 and 3 trials, treatment with revefenacin was demonstrated to result in statistical improvements in pulmonary function (≥100 mL, P < 0.05) vs placebo, including among patients with markers of more severe disease and those who received concomitant long-acting β-agonists or long-acting β-agonists together with inhaled corticosteroids. Revefenacin was also demonstrated to have efficacy similar to that of tiotropium. The clinical trial findings indicated no significant difference between revefenacin and tiotropium with regard to rates of adverse events. Overall, revefenacin was well tolerated, with COPD worsening/exacerbation, dyspnea, headache, and cough among the most common adverse events noted in the clinical trials. CONCLUSIONS: Revefenacin treatment delivered via nebulization led to improvements in lung function in patients with COPD. It was also generally well tolerated with no major safety concerns. Revefenacin provides a viable treatment option for patients with COPD and may be a suitable alternative for those with conditions that may impair proper use of traditional handheld inhalers.","Hvisdas, Christopher",Am J Health Syst Pharm,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33821890/; https://doi.org/10.1093/ajhp/zxab154,344

The aim of this study was to determine the factors associated with Covid-19 preventive behaviors among oral health care providers using an extended parallel process model (EPPM). METHODS: In a cross-sectional study, short text message invite surveys were sent to 870 oral health care providers in west part of Iran. Data were collected through validated self-report EPPM questionnaires. Descriptive statistics, Chi-square and Fishers exact tests were used for data analysis. RESULTS: In total, 300 completed questionnaires were received and the mean age of respondents was 29.89 ± 11.17 years (range: 20–75 years). Among the study population, 284 (94.67%) perceived the threat of infection highly. Washing hands frequently with water and soap and use of hand sanitizer was reported by 93.33%, of participants. Age (P = 0.010), sex (P = 0.002) and occupation field (P = 0.010) were significantly associated with danger control responses. Data identified that those oral health care providers that were on the danger control response adopted preventive behaviors more strictly than those on fear control response. CONCLUSION: The results of this study showed how degrees of perceived threat and perceived efficacy influenced oral health providers’ willingness to perform recommended health behaviors. These findings can assist public health agencies in developing educational programs specifically designed for promoting preventive behaviors among oral health providers in pandemic situations.","Shirahmadi, Samane; Seyedzadeh-Sabounchi, Shabnam; Khazaei, Salman; Bashirian, Saeid; Miresmæili, Amir Farhang; Bayat, Zeinab; Houshmand, Behzad; Semyari, Hasan; Barati, Majid; Jenabi, Ensiyeh; Heidarian, Fakhreddin; Zareian, Sepideh; Kheirandish, Mohammad; Dadae, Neda",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32790730/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0237490,344

Objectives To identify prognostic factors that may help in decision-making related to patients’ care with COVID-19. Methods This retrospective observational study included confirmed COVID-19 patients hospitalized in a private Brazilian hospital between March and September/2020. The following variables were analyzed: age, gender, comorbidities, admission laboratory data (leukocyte, lymphocyte and platelet count, D-dimer [DD], C-reactive protein [CRP], aspartate aminotransferase [AST], alanine aminotransferase [ALT], and total bilirubin [Bb]) and during follow-up (DD, CRP, AST, ALT, Bb). The severity of disease was evaluated according to the extension of pulmonary infiltration by CT scan at admission, classified as mild (<25%), moderate (25%-50%) or severe (>50%), and by mechanical ventilation need. Results 414 patients (63% males, aged 61) were included. The main comorbidities were arterial hypertension (54%) and diabetes mellitus (34%). Typical pulmonary involvement was present at admission in 318 patients: 51% mild, 39% moderate, 10% severe. 65% of patients were admitted to ICU and 25% needed mechanical ventilation. The mortality rate was 20.4%. Admission DD values (p=0.012), Bb (p=0.039), need for mechanical ventilation (p<0.001) and the extension of lung infiltration (p<0.001) were associated with mortality. During follow-up, the peak of DD (AUROC=0.875), CRP (AUROC=0.875), AST (AUROC=0.820) and Bb (AUROC=0.804) were significantly associated to mortality and the peak levels of DD (p=0.019), AST (p=0.039), ALT (p=0.021) and Bb (p=0.011) were associated to severe pulmonary infiltration. Follow-up levels of AST >60U/L (N<59) with specificity=76% and sensitivity=78%, ALT>70U/L (N<51) with specificity=77% and sensitivity=58% and Bb>0.5mg/dL with specificity=77% and sensitivity=73%, were able to predict mortality. Conclusion In association with well-known prognostic factors of mortality, serial measurements of aminotransferases and Bb can identify patients of greater severity and higher mortality risk.","Pozzobon, Fernanda Manhaes; Mello, Perez Renata; Goudar, Henrique Custódio; Nunes, Anna Butter; Chindamo, Maria Chiara",Annals of Hepatology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.aohep.2021.100439; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1665268121001381; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1665268121001381,344

Among the severe outbreaks across South America, Uruguay has become known for curtailing SARS-CoV-2 exceptionally well. To understand the SARS-CoV-2 introductions, local transmissions, and associations with genomic and clinical parameters in Uruguay, we sequenced the viral genomes of 44 outpatients and inpatients in a private healthcare system in its capital, Montevideo, from March to May 2020. We performed a phylogeographic analysis using sequences from our cohort and other studies that indicate a minimum of 23 independent introductions into Uruguay, resulting in five major transmission clusters. Our data suggest that most introductions resulting in chains of transmission originate from other South American countries, with the earliest seeding of the virus in late February 2020, weeks before the borders were closed to all non-citizens and a partial lockdown implemented. Genetic analyses suggest a dominance of S and G clades (G, GH, GR) that make up >90% of the viral strains in our study. In our cohort, lethal outcome of SARS-CoV-2 infection significantly correlated with arterial hypertension, kidney failure, and ICU admission (FDR < 0.01), but not with any mutation in a structural or non-structural protein, such as the spike D614G mutation.

METHODS: In this study, an easy-to-perform SYBR green I real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) targeting the nucleocapsid gene of IBV was developed and compared with conventional agarose gel-based RT-PCR for the detection of IBV infection. RESULTS: We found that the SYBR green I real-time RT-PCR was at least 10 times more sensitive than the agarose gel electrophoresis detection method. The assay exhibited high specificity for IBV infection. All negative controls, such as Newcastle disease virus, infectious bursal disease virus, and avian influenza virus, were not detected. CONCLUSION: The SYBR green I real-time RT-PCR test described herein can be used to rapidly distinguish IBV from other respiratory pathogens, which is important for diagnosis and control of infectious bronchitis outbreaks in Morocco. The test is a valuable and useful method as a routine assay for diagnosis of clinical IBV infection in commercial chickens.","Fellahi, Siham; Harrak, Mehdi El; Kuhn, Jens H.; Sebbar, Ghizlane; Bouaiti, El Arbi; Khataby, Khadija; Fihri, Ouafae Fassi; Houadfi, Mohammed El; Ennaji, My Mustapha",BMC Res Notes,https://doi.org/10.1186/s13104-016-2037-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27106608/,344

While its primary substrate appears to be Ang II, it can hydrolyze a number of other physiological substrates. Additionally, ACE2 functions in other noncatalytic cellular roles including the regulation of intestinal neutral amino acid transport. It also serendipitously acts as the receptor for the severe acute respiratory syndrome virus. Upregulation of ACE2 expression and function is increasingly recognized as a potential therapeutic strategy in hypertension and cardiovascular disease, diabetes, lung injury, and fibrotic disorders.

604542,Tree and rate estimation by local evaluation of heterochronous nucleotide data,2007-01-15,"SIMPLE SUMMARY: NK cells are important innate immune effectors that contribute substantially to tumor control, however the role of NK cells in haematological cancers is not as well understood. The aim of this review is to highlight the importance of the role of NK cells in the management of Ph+ Myeloproliferative Neoplasms, and emphasize the need and possible benefits of a more in-depth investigation into their role in classical MPNs and show potential strategies to harness the anti-tumoral capacities of NK cells. ABSTRACT: Myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) comprise a heterogenous group of hematologic neoplasms which are divided into Philadelphia positive (Ph+), and Philadelphia negative (Ph−) or classical MPNs. A variety of immunological factors including inflammatory, as well as immunomodulatory processes, closely interact with the disease phenotypes in MPNs. NK cells are important innate immune effectors and substantially contribute to tumor control. Changes to the absolute and proportionate numbers of NK cell, as well as phenotypical and functional alterations are seen in MPNs. In addition to the disease itself, a variety of therapeutic options in MPNs may modify NK cell characteristics. Reports of suppressive effects of MPN treatment strategies on NK cell activity have led to intensive investigations into the respective compounds, to elucidate the possible negative effects of MPN therapy on control of the leukemic clones. We hereby review the available literature on NK cells in Ph+ and Ph− MPNs and summarize today’s knowledge on disease-related alterations in this cell compartment with particular focus on known therapy-associated changes. Furthermore, we critically evaluate conflicting data with possible implications for future projects. We also aim to highlight the relevance of full NK cell functionality for disease control in MPNs and the importance of considering specific changes related to therapy in order to avoid suppressive effects on immune surveillance.","Naismith, Erin; Steichen, Janine; Sopper, Sieghart; Wolf, Dominik",Cancers (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34503210/; https://doi.org/10.3390/cancers13174400,344

Methods A short, anonymous questionnaire was sent out to all of Malta’s government sector healthcare workers via the service’s standard email services (11-19/09/2020). A total of 9,681 questionnaires were posted electronically, with 10.4% response. Results The proportion of Maltese healthcare workers who will take the influenza vaccine increased significantly. Doctors had the highest baseline uptake and highest likely influenza vaccine uptake next winter. The likely/undecided/unlikely to take a COVID-19 vaccine were 52/22/26% respectively. Males were likelier to take the vaccine. Doctors were the occupation with the highest projected vaccine uptake. Likelihood of taking COVID-19 vaccine was directly related to the likelihood of influenza vaccination. Concerns raised were related to insufficient knowledge about such a novel vaccine, especially unknown long term side effects. Discussion The increased uptake of influenza vaccine is probably due to increased awareness of respiratory viral illness. Doctors may have higher vaccine uptakes due to greater awareness and knowledge of vaccine safety. The proportions of who are likely/undecided/unlikely (half, quarter, quarter respectively) to take a COVID-19 are similar to rates reported in other countries. The higher male inclination to take the vaccine may be due the innate male propensity for perceived risk taking. Shared COVID-19 with influenza vaccine hesitancy implies an innate degree of vaccine reluctance/hesitancy and not merely reluctance based on novel vaccine knowledge gap.","Grech, Victor; Gauci, Charmaine; Agius, Steve",Early Hum Dev,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0378378220306976; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378378220306976?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.earlhumdev.2020.105213; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33032879/,344

The study objective is to develop and validate individualized mortality risk scores based on the anonymized clinical and laboratory data at admission and determine the probability of Deaths at 7 and 28 days. Data of 1393 admitted patients (Expired—8.54%) was collected from six Apollo Hospital centers (from April to July 2020) using a standardized template and electronic medical records. 63 Clinical and Laboratory parameters were studied based on the patient’s initial clinical state at admission and laboratory parameters within the first 24 h. The Machine Learning (ML) modelling was performed using eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGB) Algorithm. ‘Time to event’ using Cox Proportional Hazard Model was used and combined with XGB Algorithm. The prospective validation cohort was selected of 977 patients (Expired—8.3%) from six centers from July to October 2020.

Whether circulating testosterone or sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) contributes to such sex differences remains unknown. Objective: To evaluate the associations of circulating total testosterone (TT), free testosterone (FT), and SHBG with COVID-19 mortality. Design: Prospective analysis. Setting: UK Biobank. Participants: We included 1306 COVID-19 patients (678 men and 628 women) who had serum TT and SHBG measurements and were free of cardiovascular disease or cancer at baseline (2006-2010). Main outcome measures: The death cases of COVID-19 were identified from National Health Service death records updated at 31 July 2020. Unconditional logistic regression was performed to estimate the odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for mortality. Results: We documented 315 deaths of COVID-19 (194 men and 121 women). After adjusting for potential confounders, we did not find any statistically significant associations for TT (OR per 1-SD increase = 1.03, 95% CI: 0.85-1.25), FT (OR per 1-SD increase = 0.95, 95% CI: 0.77-1.17), or SHBG (OR per 1-SD increase = 1.09, 95% CI: 0.87-1.37) with COVID-19 mortality in men.

FIB-4 was accurate in predicting the absence or presence of advanced fibrosis with cut-offs of 1.0 and 2.65 for viral hepatitis B, 1.45 and 3.25 for viral hepatitis C, 1.30 (<65 years), 2.0 (≥65 years), and 2.67 for non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), respectively, but had a low-to-moderate accuracy in alcoholic liver disease (ALD) and autoimmune hepatitis. It performed better in excluding fibrosis, so we built an algorithm for identifying advanced fibrosis by combined methods and giving work-up and follow-up suggestions. High FIB-4 in viral hepatitis, NAFLD, and ALD was associated with significantly high hepatocellular carcinoma incidence and mortality. Additionally, FIB-4 showed the ability to predict high-risk varices with cut-offs of 2.87 and 3.91 in cirrhosis patients and predict long-term survival in hepatocellular carcinoma patients after hepatectomy. In acute liver injury caused by COVID-19, FIB-4 had a predictive value for mechanical ventilation and 30-day mortality. Finally, FIB-4 may act as a screening tool in the secondary prevention of NAFLD in the high-risk population.","Xu, Xiao-Lan; Jiang, Lu-Shun; Wu, Chen-Si; Pan, Li-Ya; Lou, Zhuo-Qi; Peng, Chun-Ting; Dong, Yin; Ruan, Bing",Journal of the Formosan Medical Association = Taiwan yi zhi,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jfma.2021.07.013; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34325952/,344

Agrobacterium tumefaciens (LBA4404) transformed with the vectors pEAQ-HT-GA733-Fc and pEAQ-HT-GA733-FcK was infiltrated into the leaves of Nicotiana benthamiana plants. To optimize harvesting of leaf to express therapeutic glycoproteins both spatially and temporally, protein expression levels at various leaf positions (top, middle, and base) and days post-infiltration (dpi) were investigated. The GA733-Fc and GA733-FcK genes were detected in leaves at 1–10 dpi using PCR. As assessed by western blot, GA733-Fc and GA733-FcK were expressed at the highest levels in the top leaf position at 5 dpi, and GA733-FcK was expressed more than GA733-Fc. The proteins were successfully purified from infiltrated N. benthamiana leaves using protein A affinity chromatography. ELISA verified that an anti-GA733 antibody recognized both purified proteins.

Abstract Introduction: The COVID-19 pandemic has had a great impact on healthcare systems. Spain, where headache is the main reason for outpatient neurology consultation, is one of the countries with the most reported cases of the disease. Objectives: This study aimed to analyse the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on headache units in Spain and to evaluate how neurologists see the future of these units. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional online survey of headache units during the sixth week of the state of alarm declared in Spain in response to the pandemic. Results: The response rate was 74%, with the participation of centres with different characteristics and from all Autonomous Communities of Spain. Limitations in face-to-face activity were reported by 95.8% of centres, with preferential face-to-face consultation being maintained in 60.4%, and urgent procedures in 45.8%. In 91.7% of centres, the cancelled face-to-face activity was replaced by telephone consultation. 95.8% of respondents stated that they would use personal protection equipment in the future, and 86% intended to increase the use of telemedicine. The majority foresaw an increase in waiting lists (93.8% for initial consultations, 89.6% for follow-up, and 89.4% for procedures) and a worse clinical situation for patients, but only 15% believed that their healthcare structures would be negatively affected in the future. Conclusions: As a consequence of the pandemic, headache care and research activity has reduced considerably.

Reduced levels of physical activity have been reported during the outbreak, affecting the normal daily pattern. OBJECTIVE: To investigate (i) the relationship of physical activity level with sleep quality and (ii) the effects of reduction physical activity levels on sleep quality. METHODS: A Google form was used to address personal information, COVID-19 personal care, physical activity, and mental health of 1,907 adult volunteers. Binary logistic regression was used to verify the association of physical activity parameters and sleep quality. RESULTS: Insufficient physical activity levels were a risk factor to have disturbed sleep pattern [OR: 1.28, 95% CI (1.01–1.62)]; however, when the BMI was added to the analysis, there was no more statistical difference [OR: 1.23, 95% CI (0.96–1.57)]. On the other hand, we found that the reduction of physical activity levels was associated with negative changes in sleep quality [OR: 1.73, 95% CI (1.37–2.18)], regardless all the confounders [OR: 1.30, 95% CI (1.01–1.68)], unless when feeling of depression was added in Model 6 [OR: 1.28, 95% CI (0.99–1.66)].

The cytokine storm is caused by the release of inflammatory agents and results in a physiologic disruption. Tocilizumab is an IL-6 receptor antagonist with the ability to suppress the cytokine storm in critically ill patients infected with SARS-CoV-2. MethodsThis was a multi-center study of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2, admitted between 3/13/20 and 4/16/20, requiring mechanical ventilation. Parameters that were evaluated included age, sex, race, usage of steroids, inflammatory markers, and comorbidities. Early dosing was defined as a tocilizumab dose administered prior to or within one (1) day of intubation. Late dosing was defined as a dose administered greater than one (1) day after intubation. A control group that was treated only with standard of care, and without tocilizumab, was utilized for comparison (untreated). FindingsWe studied 118 patients who required mechanical ventilation. Eighty-one (81) received tocilizumab, compared to 37 who were untreated. Early tocilizumab therapy was associated with a statistically significant decrease in mortality as compared to patients who were untreated (p=0.003). Dosing tocilizumab late was associated with an increased mortality compared to the untreated group (p=0.006).

The objective of the study was to assess the short- and long-term effects of air pollution on the COVID-19 risk and fatality in Lombardy and Veneto. Air pollutants were studied based on monitoring station information in Lombardy and Veneto from January 2013 to May 2020.

LMICs have significant experience implementing vaccination campaigns to respond to epidemic threats but are often hindered by chronic health system challenges. We sought to identify transferable lessons for COVID-19 vaccination from the rollout of three vaccines that targeted adult groups in Africa and South America: MenAfriVac (meningitis A); 17D (yellow fever) and rVSV-ZEBOV (Ebola virus disease). METHODS: We conducted a rapid literature review and 24 semi-structured interviews with technical experts who had direct implementation experience with the selected vaccines in Africa and South America. We identified barriers, enablers, and key lessons from the literature and from participants’ experiences. Interview data were analysed thematically according to seven implementation domains. RESULTS: Participants highlighted multiple components of vaccination campaigns that are instrumental for achieving high coverage. Community engagement is an essential and effective tool, requiring dedicated time, funding and workforce. Involving local health workers is a key enabler, as is collaborating with community leaders to map social groups and tailor vaccination strategies to their needs. Vaccination team recruitment and training strategies need to be enhanced to support vaccination campaigns. Although recognised as challenging, integrating vaccination campaigns with other routine health services can be highly beneficial if well planned and coordinated across health programmes and with communities. CONCLUSION: As supplies of COVID-19 vaccines become available to LMICs, countries need to prepare to efficiently roll out the vaccine, encourage uptake among eligible groups and respond to potential community concerns. Lessons from the implementation of these three vaccines that targeted adults in LMICs can be used to inform best practice for COVID-19 and other epidemic vaccination campaigns.","Collins, Julie; Westerveld, Rosie; Nelson, Kate A; Rohan, Hana; Bower, Hilary; Lazenby, Siobhan; Ikilezi, Gloria; Bartlein, Rebecca; Bausch, Daniel G; Kennedy, David S",BMJ Glob Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34535490/; https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjgh-2021-006951,344

Culling-induced social perturbation of badger populations may lead to unexpected outcomes. We test predictions from the ‘perturbation hypothesis’, determining the impact of culling operations on badger populations, movement of surviving individuals and the influence on the epidemiology of bTB in badgers using data dervied from two study areas within the UK Government's Randomised Badger Culling Trial (RBCT). Culling operations did not remove all individuals from setts, with between 34–43% of badgers removed from targeted social groups. After culling, bTB prevalence increased in badger social groups neighbouring removals, particularly amongst cubs. Seventy individual adult badgers were fitted with radio-collars, yielding 8,311 locational fixes from both sites between November 2001 and December 2003. Home range areas of animals surviving within removed groups increased by 43.5% in response to culling. Overlap between summer ranges of individuals from Neighbouring social groups in the treatment population increased by 73.3% in response to culling. The movement rate of individuals between social groups was low, but increased after culling, in Removed and Neighbouring social groups. Increased bTB prevalence in Neighbouring groups was associated with badger movements both into and out of these groups, although none of the moving individuals themselves tested positive for bTB. Significant increases in both the frequency of individual badger movements between groups and the emergence of bTB were observed in response to culling. However, no direct evidence was found to link the two phenomena. We hypothesise that the social disruption caused by culling may not only increase direct contact and thus disease transmission between surviving badgers, but may also increase social stress within the surviving population, causing immunosuppression and enhancing the expression of disease.","Riordan, Philip; Delahay, Richard John; Cheeseman, Chris; Johnson, Paul James; Macdonald, David Whyte",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22194946/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0028904,344

613988,The Prediction of the Epidemic Trend of COVID-19 Using Neural Networks,2020-12-31,"In this paper, an overview-based interactive visualization for temporally long dynamic data sequences is described. To reach this goal, each data object at a certain time point can be mapped to a number value based on a given property. Among others, a property is application-dependent and can be number of vertices, number of edges, average degree, density, number of self-loops, degree (maximum and total), or edge weight (minimum, maximum, and total) for dynamic graph data, but it can as well be the number of ball contacts in a football match, or the time-dependent visual attention paid to a stimulus in an eye tracking study. To achieve an overview over time, an aggregation strategy based on either the mean, minimum, or maximum of two values is applied. This temporal value aggregation generates a triangular shape with an overview of the entire data sequence as the peak. The color coding can be adjusted, forming visual patterns that can be rapidly explored for certain data features over time, supporting comparison tasks between the properties. The usefulness of the approach is illustrated by means of applying it to dynamic graphs generated from US domestic flight data as well as to dynamic Covid-19 infections on country levels.

However, to establish innovative therapeutic methods, it is crucial to learn more about the microbiota. Thereby, the area of metagenomics and associated bioinformatics methods and tools has become considerable in the study of the human microbiome biodiversity. The application of these metagenomics approaches to studying the gut microbiome in COVID-19 patients could be one of the promising areas of research in the fight against the SARS-CoV-2 infection and disparity. Therefore, understanding how the gut microbiome is affected by or could affect the SARS-CoV-2 is very important. Herein, we present an overview of approaches and methods used in the current published studies on COVID-19 patients and the gut microbiome. The accuracy of these researches depends on the appropriate choice and the optimal use of the metagenomics bioinformatics platforms and tools. Interestingly, most studies reported that COVID-19 patients’ microbiota are enriched with opportunistic microorganisms. The choice and use of appropriate computational tools and techniques to accurately investigate the gut microbiota is therefore critical in determining the appropriate microbiome profile for diagnosis and the most reliable antiviral or preventive microbial composition.","Sehli, Sofia; Allali, Imane; Chahboune, Rajaa; Bakri, Youssef; Al Idrissi, Najib; Hamdi, Salsabil; Nejjari, Chakib; Amzazi, Saaïd; Ghazal, Hassan",Bioinform Biol Insights,https://doi.org/10.1177/1177932221999428; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33786001/,344

614519,On single point forecasts for fat-tailed variables,2020-10-20,"Background Pregnant women are at increased risk of mortality and morbidity due to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Many studies reported on the association of COVID-19 with pregnancy specific adverse outcomes but prediction models utilizing large cohort of pregnant women are still lacking for estimating the risk of maternal morbidity and other adverse events. Objective The main aim of this study was to develop a prediction model to quantify the risk of progression to critical COVID-19 and intensive care unit admission in pregnant women with symptomatic infection. Study design This was a multicenter retrospective cohort study including eight hospitals from four countries (UK, Austria, Greece and Turkey). Data extraction was from February 2020 until May 2021. Included were consecutive pregnant and early postpartum women (within 10 days of birth), reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. The primary outcome was progression to critical illness requiring intensive care. Secondary outcomes included maternal death, preeclampsia and stillbirth. The association between the primary outcome and 12 candidate predictors with known association with severe COVID-19 in pregnancy, was analyzed with log-binomial mixed-effects regression and reported as adjusted risk ratios (aRR). All potential predictors were evaluated in one model and only baseline factors in another. Predictive accuracy were assessed by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUROC). Results Of 793 pregnant women positive for SARS-CoV-2 and symptomatic, 44 (5.5%) were admitted to intensive care, of whom 10 died (1.3%). The ‘mini-COvid Maternal Intensive Therapy’ model included demographic and clinical variables available at disease onset: maternal age (aRR: 1.45, 95% CI: 1.07–1.95, P=0.015); body-mass index (aRR: 1.34, 95% CI: 1.06–1.66, P=0.010); and diagnosis in the third trimester of pregnancy (aRR: 3.64, 95% CI: 1.78–8.46, P=0.001). The optimism-adjusted AUROC was 0.73. The ‘full-COvid Maternal Intensive Therapy’ model included body-mass index (aRR: 1.39, 95% CI: 1.07–1.95, P=0.015), lower respiratory symptoms (aRR: 5.11, 95% CI: 1.81–21.4, P=0.007), neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio (aRR: 1.62, 95% CI: 1.36–1.89, P<0.001); and serum C-reactive protein (aRR: 1.30, 95% CI: 1.15–1.44, P<0.001), with an optimism-adjusted AUROC 0.85. Neither model showed signs of poor fit (P>0.05). Categorization as high risk by either model was associated with a shorter diagnosis to ICU admission interval (log-rank test P<0.001, both), higher maternal death (5.2% vs. 0.2%; P<0.0001) and preeclampsia (5.7% vs. 1.0%; P=0.0003). A spreadsheet calculator is available for risk estimation. Conclusion At presentation with symptomatic COVID-19, pregnant and recently postpartum women can be stratified into high and low-risk for progression to critical disease, even where resources are limited. This can support the nature and place of care. These models also highlight the independent risk for severe disease associated with obesity, and should further emphasize that even in the absence of other co-morbidities, vaccination is particularly important for these women. Finally, the model also provides useful information for policy makers when prioritizing national vaccination programmes to quickly protect those at highest risk of critical and fatal COVID-19.","Kalafat, Erkan; Prasad, Smriti; Birol, Pinar; Tekin, Arzu Bilge; Kunt, Atilla; Di Fabrizio, Carolina; Alatas, Cengiz; Celik, Ebru; Bagci, Helin; Binder, Julia; Le Doare, Kirsty; Magee, Laura A.; Mutlu, Memis Ali; Yassa, Murat; Tug, Niyazi; Sahin, Orhan; Drokos, Panagiotis; O’Brien, Pat; Dadelszen, Peter von; Palmrich, Pilar; Papaioannou, George; Ayaz, Reyhan; Ladhani, Shamez N.; Kalantaridou, Sophia; Mihmanli, Veli; Khalil, Asma",Am J Obstet Gynecol,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajog.2021.09.024; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34582796/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0002937821010528?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0002937821010528,344

Associated with repeated respiratory infections, the disease often results in hospital admission, impaired quality of life, reduced lung function and shortened life expectancy. We describe the local clinical, physiological and sputum characteristics in patients hospitalized with an infective exacerbation of bronchiectasis. METHODS: This study examined the medical records of all 61 adults admitted to a metropolitan Australian hospital with an infective exacerbation of bronchiectasis in a calendar year. RESULTS: Baseline characteristics include: mean (SD) age of participants was 66 (14) years; 56% were women and 42% were current or ex‐smokers. The majority had other coexisting medical conditions, with asthma in 44%, COPD in 59% and both asthma and COPD in 31%. Seventy‐two percent were on regular inhaled medication, 23% on cyclical antibiotics and 26% undertook regular respiratory physiotherapy. Bronchodilator reversibility was present in 17% and small airway reversibility in 41%. Sputum demonstrated normal flora in 17%, Pseudomonas aeruginosa in 32%, Haemophilus influenzae in 15% and both organisms in 17%.

Primary human synovial fibroblasts cells were used to assess infection by ONNV and the resulting cytokine responses. Phenolics (gallic acid, caffeic acid and chlorogenic acid, curcumin and quercetin) and a curcuminoids-rich extract from turmeric were tested for their antiviral and anti-inflammatory capacities. We showed that infection occurred in HSF cells and increased gene expression and protein secretion of two major proinflammatory CCL-2 and IL-1β markers. In ONNV-infected HSF cells (MOI 1), we found that non-cytotoxic concentrations of phenolics (10 µM) reduced the level of viral RNA (E1, E2, nsP1, nsP2) and downregulated CCL-2 and IL-1β expression and secretion.

Objective: During the period from the beginning of the pandemic from March 1 to October 1, 2020, 10 cases of COVID-19 in children and adolescents with cystic fibrosis (CF) were analysed (according to the organising committee of the CF Registry) in comparison with 85,282 sick children from the general population of children and adolescents of the Russian Federation. Methods: Detection of 2019-nCoV coronavirus RNA by PCR or ELISA of class M and G immunoglobulins for SARS-CoV-2. Results: As of October 1, the incidence of COVID-19 was 340:100,000 for children and 840:100,000 for adults. Among 10 children with CF (boys −90%, girls −10%) there were no children under 1y.o. (in the population- 12.4%), in the group 1–3y.o −20% (in the population −15.8%), in the group 4–7 y.o.- 40% (in the comparison group - 20.3%), in the group >8 y.o. −40%, (in the comparison group 51.5%). Among children with CF, 1 child of 1y.o. was hospitalised (10% of all cases), in the general population – 34,912 (40.93%). The ratio of children treated on an outpatient basis and in a hospital in the population was 1: 2.2, with CF 1:10. Pneumonia in children with CF and COVID-19 was registered in 3 children (30%), and in children in the general population - 9.7%. Asymptomatic course was observed in 3 patients (30%) with CF. The main symptom of CF was fever (60%) and in the population −7.5%, increased cough and weakness were in 50% of children with CF, in the population - 37% and 35.4%, respectively. Conclusion: The incidence among children with CF was less common than in adults, and there was a different age structure of children with COVID-19 among patients with CF and in the population.

622921,Could virtual reality applications pose real risks to children and adolescents? A systematic review of ethical issues and concerns,2021-08-03,"BACKGROUND: The outcome of a viral infection is regulated by complex interactions of viral and host factors. SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) engages and regulates several innate immune response pathways during infection. We have previously shown that the SARS-CoV Papain-like Protease (PLpro) inhibits type I interferon (IFN) by inhibiting IRF3 phosphorylation thereby blocking downstream Interferon induction. This finding prompted us to identify other potential mechanisms of inhibition of PLpro on IFN induction. METHODS: We have used plasmids expressing PLpro and IRF3 including an IRF3 mutant that is constitutively active, called IRF3(5D). In these experiments we utilize transfections, chromatin immunoprecipitation, Electro-mobility Shift Assays (EMSA) and protein localization to identify where IRF3 and IRF3(5D) are inhibited by PLpro. RESULTS: Here we show that PLpro also inhibits IRF3 activation at a step after phosphorylation and that this inhibition is dependent on the de-ubiquitination (DUB) activity of PLpro. We found that PLpro is able to block the type I IFN induction of a constitutively active IRF3, but does not inhibit IRF3 dimerization, nuclear localization or DNA binding. However, inhibition of PLpro’s DUB activity by mutagenesis blocked the IRF3 inhibition activity of PLpro, suggesting a role for IRF3 ubiquitination in induction of a type I IFN innate immune response. CONCLUSION: These results demonstrate an additional mechanism that PLpro is able to inhibit IRF3 signaling. These data suggest novel innate immune antagonism activities of PLpro that may contribute to SARS-CoV pathogenesis.","Matthews, Krystal; Schäfer, Alexandra; Pham, Alissa; Frieman, Matthew",Virol J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25481026/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12985-014-0209-9,344

A growing number of pediatric infected cases have been reported. Great efforts are needed to cut down the transmission. METHODS: A single-arm meta-analysis was conducted. We searched PubMed, Google Scholar, Web of Science, and several Chinese databases for studies presenting characteristics of children confirmed with Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) from December 12, 2019 to May 10, 2020. Quality Appraisal of Case Series Studies Checklist was used to assess quality and publication bias was analyzed by Egger’s test. Random-effect model was used to calculate the pooled incidence rate (IR) or mean difference (MD) with 95% confidence intervals (CI), or a fixed model instead when I(2) < 50%. We conducted subgroup analysis according to geographic region. Additionally, we searched United Nations Educational Scientific and Cultural Organization to see how different countries act to the education disruption in COVID-19. RESULTS: 29 studies with 4300 pediatric patients were included. The mean age was 7.04 (95% CI: 5.06–9.08) years old. 18.9% of children were asymptomatic (95% CI: 0.121–0.266), 37.4% (95% CI: 0.280–0.474) had no radiographic abnormalities. Besides, a proportion of 0.1% patients were admitted to intensive care units (0, 95% CI: 0.000–0.013) and four deaths were reported (0, 95% CI: 0.000–0.000). Up to 159 countries have implemented nationwide school closures, affecting over 70% of the world’s students. CONCLUSION: Children were also susceptible to SARS-CoV-2, while critical cases or deaths were rare.

The use of facial masks and other full personal protective equipment increases air flow resistance, facial skin temperature and physical discomfort. The aim of the present study was to measure surgeons’ oxygenation status and discomfort before and after their daily routine activities of oral interventions. Methods: 10 male voluntary dentists, specializing in oral surgery, and 10 male voluntary doctors in dentistry, participating in master’s courses in oral surgery in the Department of Oral Surgery of the University of Chieti, with mean age 29 ± 6 (27–35), were enrolled. This study was undertaken to investigate the effects of wearing a PFM on oxygenation status while the oral surgeons were actively working. Disposable sterile one-way surgical paper masks (Surgical Face Mask, Euronda, Italy) and FFP2 (Surgical Face Mask, Euronda, Italy) were used and the mask position covering the nose did not vary during the procedures. The FFP2 was covered by a surgical mask during surgical treatment. A pulse oximeter was used to measure the blood oximetry saturation during the study. Results: In all 20 surgeons wearing FFP2 covered by surgical masks, a reduction in arterial O(2) saturation from around 97.5% before surgery to 94% after surgery was recorded with increase of heart rates. A shortness of breath and light-headedness/headaches were also noted. Conclusions: In conclusion, wearing an FFP2 covered by a surgical mask induces a reduction in circulating O(2) concentrations without clinical relevance, while an increase of heart frequency and a sensation of shortness of breath, light-headedness/headaches were recorded.","Scarano, Antonio; Inchingolo, Francesco; Rapone, Biagio; Festa, Felice; Rexhep Tari, Sergio; Lorusso, Felice",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18052363; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33670983/,344

In particular, RNA viruses deserve special concern given their documented impact on conservation biology, veterinary medicine and public health, with an unprecedented ability to promote an evolutionary host–pathogen arms race from the ultimate infection and immunity perspective. However, besides the requisite molecular/gross anatomical and physiological bases for infectious diseases to transmit from one host to another, both viral pathogens and their reservoirs/vectors exploit a complex anthropological, cultural, historical, psychological and social suite that specifically defines the phylodynamics within Homo sapiens, unlike any other species. Some of these variables include the ecological benefits of living in groups, decisions on hunting and foraging behaviours and dietary preferences, myths and religious doctrines, health economics, travel destinations, population planning, political decisions on agricultural product bans and many others, in a homo-sociome memetic complex. Taken to an extreme, such complexities elucidate the underpinnings of explanations as to why certain viral zoonoses reside in neglected people, places and things, whereas others are chosen selectively and prioritized for active mitigation. Canine-transmitted rabies serves as one prime example of how a neglected viral zoonosis may transition to greater attention on the basis of renewed advocacy, social media, local champions and vested international community engagement.

627416,Autonomous wheelchair for patient’s transportation on healthcare institutions,2021-02-22,"Immunohistochemistry was used to study herpes simplex virus type 1–induced central nervous system demyelination in the trigminal root entry zone of mice inoculated with herpes simplex virus type 1 by the corneal route. There was no change in peripheral nervous system myelin as shown by immunostaining for Po glycoprotein. Double immunoperoxidase staining for herpes simplex virus type 1 antigens and glial fibrillary acidic protein showed that most of the infected cells were astrocytes. Glial fibrillary acidic protein immunostaining was completely lost in the inferior medial portion of the trigeminal root entry zone at 6 days after herpes simplex virus type 1 inoculation, a time when central nervous system myelin was preserved as indicated by immunostaining for myelin basic protein. The pattern of glial fibrillary acidic protein staining did not change and herpes simplex virus type 1 antigens were no longer detected after day 8. There was a progressive loss of myelin basic protein staining within the area unstained by glial fibrillary acidic protein antisera on days 8 to 14. This pattern of astrocyte loss before central nervous system demyelination is strikingly different from the reactive astrocytosis seen in other demyelinating lesions, such as acute experimental allergic encephalomyelitis, progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, or acute multiple sclerosis. Herpes simplex virus type 1 infection in mice provides an unusual model of acute central nervous system demyelination preceded by a loss of astrocytes.","Itoyama, Yasuto; Sekizawa, Tsuyoshi; Openshaw, Harry; Kogure, Kyuya; Goto, Ikuo",Ann Neurol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2042945/,344

Close contact with symptomatic patients appears to be the main route of transmission, whereas blood transfusion trans‐ mission could not be ruled out. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: A SARS coronavirus (SARS‐CoV) detection kit developed by C. Drosten (Bernhard Nocht Institute, BNI) was used to amplify SARS‐CoV sequences from blood donor samples. We tested 31,151 blood donor samples in minipools of up to 96 samples. To validate the sensitivity of the assay, routine donor minipools (88 ± 8 samples per pool) were spiked with plasma of an imported case of SARS or of a subsequently infected contact person, respectively. Gamma‐irradiated cell culture supernatants of Vero E6 cells, infected with SARS‐CoV, were used as positive controls. RESULTS: None of 31,151 blood donors were positive for the presence of SARS. Two 96‐member plasma pools that were each spiked with 100 µL of plasma of the German index patient or his wife, respectively, were positive. Overall, 0.85 percent of test results had to be considered invalid owing to negative internal controls. CONCLUSION: A real‐time CoV PCR test is able to detect SARS‐CoV in viremic blood donor samples even in the beginning of the disease when patients present minor clinical symptoms. Thus the assay could potentially help to prevent transfusion‐associated SARS‐CoV transmissions.","Schmidt, Michael; Brixner, Veronika; Ruster, Brigitte; Hourfar, Michael K.; Drosten, Christian; Preiser, Wolfgang; Seifried, Erhard; Roth, W.

Design Epidemiological investigations conducted after a family cluster of two patients with avian H7N9 in March 2013. Setting Wuxi, Eastern China. Participants Two patients, their close contacts, and relevant environments. Samples from the patients and environments were collected and tested by real time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR), viral culture, and haemagglutination inhibition assay. Any contacts who became ill had samples tested for avian H7N9 by rRT-PCR. Paired serum samples were obtained from contacts for serological testing by haemagglutination inhibition assays. Main outcomes measures Clinical data, history of exposure before the onset of illnesses, and results of laboratory testing of pathogens and further analysis of sequences and phylogenetic tree to isolated strains. Results The index patient became ill five to six days after his last exposure to poultry. The second patient, his daughter aged 32, who provided unprotected bedside care in the hospital, had no known exposure to poultry. She developed symptoms six days after her last contact with her father. Two strains were isolated successfully from the two patients. Genome sequence and analyses of phylogenetic trees showed that both viruses were almost genetically identical. Forty three close contacts of both patients were identified. One had mild illness but had negative results for avian H7N9 by rRT-PCR. All 43 close contacts tested negative for haemagglutination inhibition antibodies specific for avian H7N9. Conclusions The infection of the daughter probably resulted from contact with her father (the index patient) during unprotected exposure, suggesting that in this cluster the virus was able to transmit from person to person. The transmissibility was limited and non-sustainable.","Qi, Xian; Qian, Yan-Hua; Bao, Chang-Jun; Guo, Xi-Ling; Cui, Lun-Biao; Tang, Fen-Yang; Ji, Hong; Huang, Yong; Cai, Pei-Quan; Lu, Bing; Xu, Ke; Shi, Chao; Zhu, Feng-Cai; Zhou, Ming-Hao; Wang, Hua",BMJ,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23920350/; https://doi.org/10.1136/bmj.f4752,344

The international guidelines for the prevention and treatment of the COVID-19 pandemic have been frequently updated. Such guidelines assist the governmental regulatory bodies in taking optimal measures and safeguarding their citizens against the pandemic. We conducted a short survey with a Saudi cohort to understand the awareness about COVID-19 and estimate the responses for mitigation strategies. Methods An electronic survey was conducted, and the first 388 responses were analysed for publishing an initial report. The questionnaire comprised 27 items and was divided into three sections, namely demographic, awareness, and response to mitigation strategies and participants’ self-perceived behaviours regarding COVID-19. The perceptions of the participants were compared with their responses to mitigation measures. Results In our study, 89.7% understood the meaning of pandemic, while 82.2% correctly identified that the elderly belonged to a high-risk group for the COVID-19 infection. As many as 96.1% agreed that staying at home was one of the mitigation strategies. Nearly 35% preferred self-medication. Higher educational level (OR: 2.09, 95% CI: 1.02- 4.29) and longer working hours were found to be significantly associated with a positive response to mitigation measures with p<0.04 and p<.02, respectively. Conclusions We report better understanding and appropriate response to mitigation measures towards the COVID-19 pandemic among the general population in Saudi Arabia.

630096,Interventional Radiology ex-machina: impact of Artificial Intelligence on practice,2021-04-16,"Plasmodium falciparum antigens expressed on the surface of infected erythrocytes are important targets of naturally acquired immunity against malaria, but their high number and variability provide the pathogen with a powerful means of escape from host antibodies(1–4). Although broadly reactive antibodies against these antigens could be useful as therapeutics and in vaccine design, their identification has proven elusive. Here, we report the isolation of human monoclonal antibodies that recognize erythrocytes infected by different P. falciparum isolates and opsonize these cells by binding to members of the RIFIN family. These antibodies acquired broad reactivity through a novel mechanism of insertion of a large DNA fragment between the V and DJ segments. The insert, which is both necessary and sufficient for binding to RIFINs, encodes the entire 100 amino acid collagen-binding domain of LAIR-1, an Ig superfamily inhibitory receptor encoded on chromosome 19. In each of the two donors studied, the antibodies are produced by a single expanded B cell clone and carry distinct somatic mutations in the LAIR-1 domain that abolish binding to collagen and increase binding to infected erythrocytes. These findings illustrate, with a biologically relevant example, a novel mechanism of antibody diversification by interchromosomal DNA transposition and demonstrate the existence of conserved epitopes that may be suitable candidates for the development of a malaria vaccine.","Tan, Joshua; Pieper, Kathrin; Piccoli, Luca; Abdi, Abdirahman; Perez, Mathilde Foglierini; Geiger, Roger; Tully, Claire Maria; Jarrossay, David; Maina Ndungu, Francis; Wambua, Juliana; Bejon, Philip; Fregni, Chiara Silacci; Fernandez-Rodriguez, Blanca; Barbieri, Sonia; Bianchi, Siro; Marsh, Kevin; Thathy, Vandana; Corti, Davide; Sallusto, Federica; Bull, Peter; Lanzavecchia, Antonio",Nature,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26700814/; https://doi.org/10.1038/nature16450,344

632336,Lessons from the past.,2020-05-04,"ABSTRACT Background As of March 26, 2020, the United States had the highest number of confirmed cases of Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) of any country in the world. Hospital critical care is perhaps the most important medical system choke point in terms of preventing deaths in a disaster scenario such as the current COVID-19 pandemic. We therefore brought together previously established disease modeling estimates of the growth of the COVID-19 epidemic in the US under various social distancing contact reduction assumptions, with local estimates of the potential critical care surge response across all US counties. Methods Estimates of spatio-temporal COVID-19 demand and medical system critical care supply were calculated for all continental US counties. These estimates were statistically summarized and mapped for US counties, regions and urban versus non-urban areas. Estimates of COVID-19 infections and patients needing critical care were calculated from March 24, 2020 to April 24, 2020 for three different estimated population levels - 0%, 25%, and 50% - of contact reduction (through actions such as social distancing). Multiple national public and private datasets were linked and harmonized in order to calculate county-level critical care bed counts that included currently available beds and those that could be made available under four surge response scenarios - very low, low, medium, and high - as well as excess deaths stemming from inaccessible critical care. Results Surge response scenarios ranged from a very low total supply 77,588 critical care beds to a high total of 278,850 critical care beds. Over the four week study period, excess deaths from inaccessible critical care ranged from 24,688 in the very low response scenario to 13,268 in the high response scenario. Northeastern and urban counties were projected to be most affected by excess deaths due to critical care shortages, and counties in New York, Colorado, and Virginia were projected to exceed their critical care bed limits despite high levels of COVID-19 contact reduction. Over the four week study period, an estimated 12,203-19,594 excess deaths stemming from inaccessible critical care could be averted through greater preventive actions such as travel restrictions, publicly imposed contact precautions, greater availability of rapid testing for COVID-19, social distancing, self-isolation when sick, and similar interventions. An estimated 4,029-11,420 excess deaths stemming from inaccessible critical care could be averted through aggressive critical care surge response and preparations, including high clearance of ICU and non-ICU critical care beds and extraordinary measures like using a single ventilator for multiple patients. Conclusions Unless the epidemic curve of COVID-19 cases is flattened over an extended period of time, the US COVID-19 epidemic will cause a shortage of critical care beds and drive up otherwise preventable deaths. The findings here support value of preventive actions to flatten the epidemic curve, as well as the value of exercising extraordinary surge capacity measures to increase access to hospital critical care for severely ill COVID-19 patients.","Branas, Charles C; Rundle, Andrew; Pei, Sen; Yang, Wan; Carr, Brendan G; Sims, Sarah; Zebrowski, Alexis; Doorley, Ronan; Schluger, Neil; Quinn, James W; Shaman, Jeffrey",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.01.20049759,344

The number of exposed contacts was <10 for scenarios with hygiene concept and good ventilation, but substantially higher otherwise. Of subsequent cases, 0%-23% were attributable to MGEs. Overall, the expected additional effect of indoor MGEs on burden of infections is low if hygiene concepts are applied and adequate ventilation exists.","Moritz, S.; Gottschick, C.; Horn, J.; Popp, M.; Langer, S.; Klee, B.; Purschke, O.; Gekle, M.; Ihling, A.; Mikolajczyk, R.",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.10.28.20221580; http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.28.20221580v1?rss=1,344

While advancements in other diagnostic modalities have allowed for more efficient and accurate diagnosis, the stethoscope has evolved in parallel to address the needs of the modern era of medicine. These advancements include sound visualization, ambient noise reduction/cancellation, Bluetooth™ transmission, and computer algorithm diagnostic support. However, despite these advancements, the ever-changing climate of infection prevention, especially in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, has led many to question the stethoscope as a vector for infectious diseases. Stethoscopes have been reported to harbor bacteria with contamination levels comparable to a physician's hand. Although disinfection is recommended, stethoscope hygiene compliance remains low. In addition, disinfectants may not be completely effective in eliminating microorganisms. Despite these risks, the growing technological integration with the stethoscope continues to make it a highly valuable tool. Rather than casting our valuable tool and symbol of medicine aside, we must create and implement an effective method of stethoscope hygiene to keep patients safe. • Stethoscopes are clinically valuable and integral to the doctor-patient connection; • Technological advancement will augment the utility of the stethoscope; • The stethoscope has high utility for assessment of COVID-19 patients; • Pathogen contamination in light of COVID-19 is a concern for the stethoscope; • Innovations in stethoscope hygiene will allow safe auscultation.","Vasudevan, Rajiv S.; Horiuchi, Yu; Torriani, Francesca J.; Cotter, Bruno; Maisel, Sofie M.; Dadwal, Sanjeet S.; Gaynes, Robert; Maisel, Alan S.",Am J Med,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.amjmed.2020.05.018; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0002934320305088; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0002934320305088?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32569591/,344

The risk factors, clinical treatments, especially comprehensive risk models for COVID-19 death are urgently warranted. METHODS: In this retrospective study, 281 non-survivors and 712 survivors with propensity score matching by age, sex, and comorbidities were enrolled from January 13, 2020 to March 31, 2020. RESULTS: Higher SOFA, qSOFA, APACHE II and SIRS scores, hypoxia, elevated inflammatory cytokines, multi-organ dysfunction, decreased immune cell subsets, and complications were significantly associated with the higher COVID-19 death risk. In addition to traditional predictors for death risk, including APACHE II (AUC = 0.83), SIRS (AUC = 0.75), SOFA (AUC = 0.70) and qSOFA scores (AUC = 0.61), another four prediction models that included immune cells subsets (AUC = 0.90), multiple organ damage biomarkers (AUC = 0.89), complications (AUC = 0.88) and inflammatory-related indexes (AUC = 0.75) were established. Additionally, the predictive accuracy of combining these risk factors (AUC = 0.950) was also significantly higher than that of each risk group alone, which was significant for early clinical management for COVID-19.

We aimed to investigate the impact of COVID-19 on the healthcare of patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in epicenter and non-epicenter areas. Methods: Patients with IBD from Hubei province (the epicenter of COVID-19) and Guangdong province (a non-epicenter area), China were surveyed during the pandemic. The questionnaire included change of medications (steroids, immunomodulators, and biologics), procedures (lab tests, endoscopy, and elective surgery), and healthcare mode (standard healthcare vs. telemedicine) during 1 month before and after the outbreak of COVID-19. Results: In total, 324 IBD patients from Guangdong province (non-epicenter) and 149 from Hubei province (epicenter) completed the questionnaire with comparable demographic characteristics. Compared to patients in Guangdong province (non-epicenter), significantly more patients in Hubei (epicenter) had delayed lab tests/endoscopy procedures [61.1% (91/149) vs. 25.3% (82/324), p < 0.001], drug withdrawal [28.6% (43/149) vs. 9.3% (30/324), p < 0.001], delayed biologics infusions [60.4% (90/149) vs. 19.1% (62/324), p < 0.001], and postponed elective surgery [16.1% (24/149) vs. 3.7% (12/324), p < 0.001]. There was an increased use of telemedicine after the outbreak compared to before the outbreak in Hubei province [38.9% (58/149) vs. 15.4% (23/149), p < 0.001], while such a significant increase was not observed in Guangdong province [21.9% (71/324) vs. 18.8% (61/324), p = 0.38]. Approximately two-thirds of IBD patients from both sites agreed that telemedicine should be increasingly used in future medical care. Conclusions: Our patient-based survey study in a real-world setting showed that COVID-19 resulted in a great impact on the healthcare of patients with IBD, and such an impact was more obvious in the epicenter compared to the non-epicenter area of COVID-19.

634644,How Risk Profiles of Investors Affect Robo-Advised Portfolios,2020-09-18,"OBJECTIVES: Arabs in Israel have been found to experience higher levels of mental distress compared to Jews due to COVID-19. However, the social mechanisms underlying mental health vulnerability in the context of mass crisis have been understudied. Based on the Conservation of Resources (COR) theory, the aim of the current study was to examine experiences of resource loss, social exclusion, ethnic discrimination, and social support and their association with depression and anxiety symptoms during the COVID-19 outbreak among Arabs in Israel. METHOD: The sample included 665 adult Arabs in Israel who completed an online self-report questionnaire regarding background variables, resource loss due to COVID-19, social exclusion, ethnic discrimination, social support, and depression and anxiety symptoms. RESULTS: Participants reported on average mild depression and anxiety severity scores, and 15.2% met criteria for major depressive disorder. Many (43.1%) reported experiencing more than 1 loss due to COVID-19 in health, finances or occupation, and interpersonal relationships. Path analyses show that cumulative losses due to COVID-19 and social exclusion were directly associated with depression and anxiety symptom levels. Discrimination moderated the association between losses and both depression and anxiety symptom levels. CONCLUSION: Mental health is embedded in dynamic sociopolitical contexts. Arabs as a national minority in Israel have a perceived sense of social exclusion and discrimination and social and material resource deprivation, which relates to their vulnerability, especially in the face of crisis. It is our obligation as researchers and practitioners to illuminate the centrality of these oppressive mechanisms in shaping mental health vulnerability. Clinical Impact Statement: The present study suggests that social exclusion and cumulative resource losses due to COVID-19 in areas of health, occupation, finances, and social connections predict depression and anxiety among Arabs in Israel. In addition, ethnic discrimination moderates the relationship between cumulative losses and mental health outcomes. These results highlight the importance of developing and implementing context-informed health and social care policies and practices, especially in this time of crisis.

Data on symptoms and prognosis in children are rare. METHODS: A systematic literature review was carried out to identify papers on COVID‐19, which is caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2), using the MEDLINE and Embase databases between January 1 and March 18, 2020. RESULTS: The search identified 45 relevant scientific papers and letters. The review showed that children have so far accounted for 1%‐5% of diagnosed COVID‐19 cases, they often have milder disease than adults and deaths have been extremely rare. Diagnostic findings have been similar to adults, with fever and respiratory symptoms being prevalent, but fewer children seem to have developed severe pneumonia. Elevated inflammatory markers were less common in children, and lymphocytopenia seemed rare. Newborn infants have developed symptomatic COVID‐19, but evidence of vertical intrauterine transmission was scarce. Suggested treatment included providing oxygen, inhalations, nutritional support and maintaining fluids and electrolyte balances. CONCLUSIONS: The coronavirus disease 2019 has occurred in children, but they seemed to have a milder disease course and better prognosis than adults. Deaths were extremely rare.","Ludvigsson, Jonas F.",Acta Paediatr,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32202343/; https://doi.org/10.1111/apa.15270,344

This study investigates how students in Pakistan have coped with the COVID-19. Zung’s self-rating anxiety scale (SAS) was used for measuring anxiety and the coping strategies were measured on four strategies i.e., seeking social support, humanitarian, acceptance, and mental disengagement. Among 494 respondents, 61% were females and 77.3% of the students were in the age group of 19–25 years. The study findings indicate that approximately 41 percent of students are experiencing some level of anxiety, including 16% with severe to extreme levels. Seeking social support seemed to be the least preferred coping strategy and that female students seek social support, humanitarian, and acceptance coping strategies more than males. Students used both emotion-based and problem-based coping strategies. The variables of gender, age, ethnicity, level and type of study, and living arrangement of the students were associated with usage of coping strategies.

635756,Spatial dynamics and optimization method for a rumor propagation model in both homogeneous and heterogeneous environment,2021-08-17,"BACKGROUND: Over the last decade, virtual reality (VR) has emerged as a cutting-edge technology in stroke rehabilitation. VR is defined as a type of computer-user interface that implements real-time simulation of an activity or environment allowing user interaction via multiple sensory modalities. In a stroke population, VR interventions have been shown to enhance motor, cognitive, and psychological recovery when utilized as a rehabilitation adjunct. VR has also demonstrated noninferiority to usual care therapies for stroke rehabilitation. OBJECTIVE: The proposed pilot study aims to (1) determine the feasibility and tolerability of using a therapeutic VR platform in an inpatient comprehensive stroke rehabilitation program and (2) estimate the initial clinical efficacy (effect size) associated with the VR platform using apps for pain distraction and upper extremity exercise for poststroke neurologic recovery. METHODS: This study will be conducted in the Comprehensive Integrated Inpatient Rehabilitation Program at the James A Haley Veterans’ Hospital. Qualitative interviews will be conducted with 10 clinical staff members to assess the feasibility of the VR platform from the clinician perspective. A prospective within-subject pretest-posttest pilot design will be used to examine the tolerability of the VR platform and the clinical outcomes (ie, upper extremity neurologic recovery, hand dexterity, pain severity) in 10 veteran inpatients. A VR platform consisting of commercially available pain distraction and upper extremity apps will be available at the participants’ bedside for daily use during their inpatient stay (approximately 4-6 weeks). Clinician interviews will be analyzed using qualitative descriptive analysis. Cohen d effect sizes with corresponding 95% CIs will be calculated for upper extremity neurologic recovery, hand dexterity, and pain. The proportion of participants who achieve minimal clinically important difference after using the VR platform will be calculated for each clinical outcome. RESULTS: This study was selected for funding in August 2020. Institutional review board approval was received in October 2020. The project start date was December 2020. The United States Department has issued a moratorium on in-person research activities secondary to COVID-19. Data collection will commence once this moratorium is lifted. CONCLUSIONS: Our next step is to conduct a large multi-site clinical trial that will incorporate the lessons learned from this pilot feasibility study to test the efficacy of a VR intervention in inpatient rehabilitation and transition to home environments. When VR is used in patients’ rooms, it serves to provide additional therapy and may reduce clinician burden. VR also presents an opportunity similar to home-based practice exercises. VR can be implemented in both clinical settings and people’s own homes, where engagement in ongoing self-management approaches is often most challenging. This unique experience offers the potential for seamless transition from inpatient rehabilitation to the home.

Previous studies have shown the image-derived metric of ventilation defect per cent (VDP) to correlate with forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV(1))/forced vital capacity (FVC) and FEV(1) in asthma. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to explore the utility of hyperpolarised xenon-129 ((129)Xe) ventilation MRI in clinical care and examine its relationship with spirometry and other clinical metrics in people seen in a severe asthma service. METHODS: 26 people referred from a severe asthma clinic for MRI scanning were assessed by contemporaneous (129)Xe MRI and spirometry. A subgroup of 18 patients also underwent reversibility testing with spirometry and MRI. Quantitative MRI measures of ventilation were calculated, VDP and the ventilation heterogeneity index (VH(I)), and compared to spirometry, Asthma Control Questionnaire 7 (ACQ7) and blood eosinophil count. Images were reviewed by a multidisciplinary team. RESULTS: VDP and VH(I) correlated with FEV(1), FEV(1)/FVC and forced expiratory flow between 25% and 75% of FVC but not with ACQ7 or blood eosinophil count. Discordance of MRI imaging and symptoms and/or pulmonary function tests also occurred, prompting diagnostic re-evaluation in some cases. CONCLUSION: Hyperpolarised gas MRI provides a complementary method of assessment in people with difficult to manage asthma in a clinical setting. When used as a tool supporting clinical care in a severe asthma service, occurrences of discordance between symptoms, spirometry and MRI scanning indicate how MRI scanning may add to a management pathway.","Mussell, Grace T.; Marshall, Helen; Smith, Laurie J.; Biancardi, Alberto M.; Hughes, Paul J.C.; Capener, David J.; Bray, Jody; Swift, Andrew J.; Rajaram, Smitha; Condliffe, Alison M.; Collier, Guilhem J.; Johns, Chris S.; Weatherley, Nick D.; Wild, Jim M.; Sabroe, Ian",ERJ Open Res,https://doi.org/10.1183/23120541.00785-2020; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34589542/,344

This essay explores the prospect of adopting a science-based framework for confronting these potentially adverse prospects. It explores a perspective based on relevant ecological and behavioral science. The objective is to involve concerned citizens of the world in this enterprise. The overall objective is to maintain Planet Earth as a favorable home for the future of humanity. Nine ecological principles explain one major aspect of what is happening and provide critical guidelines for appropriate action. Nine social behaviors explore how we might integrate social science insights with those from ecology. Twenty predictions are proposed based on these ecological and social science principles plus existing trends. If these trends are not vigorously and courageously confronted, we will likely be on track for the demise of our civilization. As we examine these challenges, our job will be especially complicated because a major segment of humanity is not prepared to accept evidence based on science, and this generates much resistance to any efforts directed toward effective control of current and future challenges. In these complex circumstances, we must remain as cooperative and optimistic as possible so that we can promote the needed willpower and ingenuity.

Many publications claim highly accurate forecasts or highly profitable investment strategies. At the same time, the picture of real-world AI-driven investments is ambiguous and conspicuously lacking in high-profile success cases (while it is not lacking in high-profile failures).

639028,What has luck got to do with economic development? An interpretation of resurgent Asia’s growth experience,2004-05-10,"CONTEXT: Lymphopenia is a key feature of immune dysfunction in patients with bacterial sepsis and COVID-19 and associated with poor clinical outcomes, but the cause is largely unknown. Severely ill patients may present with thyroid function abnormalities, so-called non-thyroidal illness syndrome (NTIS), and several studies have linked TSH and the thyroid hormones thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3) to homeostatic regulation and function of lymphocyte populations. PURPOSE: To test the hypothesis that abnormal thyroid function correlates with lymphopenia in patients with severe infections. METHODS: Retrospective analysis of absolute lymphocyte counts, circulating TSH, T4, free T4 (FT4), T3, albumin and inflammatory biomarkers was performed in two independent hospitalized study populations: bacterial sepsis (n=224) and COVID-19 patients (n=161). A subgroup analysis was performed in patients with severe lymphopenia and normal lymphocyte counts. RESULTS: Only T3 significantly correlated (rho=0.252) with lymphocyte counts in patients with bacterial sepsis and lower concentrations were found in severe lymphopenic compared to non-lympopenic patients (n=56 per group). Severe lymphopenic COVID-19 patients (n=17) showed significantly lower plasma concentrations of TSH, T4, FT4 and T3 compared to patients without lymphopenia (n=18), and demonstrated significantly increased values of the inflammatory markers interleukin-6, C-reactive protein and ferritin. Remarkably, after one week follow-up, the majority (12/15) of COVID-19 patients showed quantitative recovery of their lymphocyte numbers, while TSH and thyroid hormones remained mainly disturbed. CONCLUSION: Abnormal thyroid function correlates with lymphopenia in patients with severe infections, like bacterial sepsis and COVID-19, but future studies need to establish whether a causal relationship is involved.","Grondman, Inge; de Nooijer, Aline H; Antonakos, Nikolaos; Janssen, Nico A F; Mouktaroudi, Maria; Leventogiannis, Konstantinos; Medici, Marco; Smit, Jan W A; van Herwaarden, Antonius E; Joosten, Leo A B; van der Veerdonk, Frank L; Pickkers, Peter; Kox, Matthijs; Jaeger, Martin; Netea, Mihai G; Giamarellos-Bourboulis, Evangelos J; Netea-Maier, Romana T",J Clin Endocrinol Metab,https://doi.org/10.1210/clinem/dgab148; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33713408/,344

METHODS: Fifty-one patients were diagnosed with CRKP bloodstream infection between January 2015 and December 2020, among which 42 isolates were available for further study. Species identification and antibiotic susceptibilities were tested with matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) and VITEK 2 systems. Carbapenemase genes, virulence genes and MLST genes were detected by polymerase chain reaction. Moreover, the string test and serum killing assay were performed to evaluate the virulence of the CRKP isolates. RESULTS: During the six-year period, the detection rate of CRKP in bloodstream infection showed an increasing trend, with the intensive care unit, hematology and respiratory medicine wards mainly affected. Molecular epidemiology analyses showed that KPC-2 was the dominant carbapenemase gene. In addition, the dominant sequence type (ST) of CRKP shifted from ST11 to ST15 strains, which were all sensitive to amikacin in contrast to the ST11 stains. Furthermore, ST15 CRKP strains were positive for the KfuB virulence gene and more resistant to serum killing compared to the ST11 CRKP strains. Nonetheless, the mortality rate of patients infected with ST11 and ST15 CRKP did not show any significant differences. CONCLUSION: A shift in the dominant sequence type of CRKP bloodstream infections from ST11 to ST15 was observed during the years 2015–2020. Compared to ST11, the ST15 CRKP strains showed amikacin sensitivity, positivity for KfuB gene, and serum resistance, which may indicate stronger virulence.","Chen, Jingjing; Hu, Chang; Wang, Ruixuan; Li, Fushun; Sun, Guoquan; Yang, Min; Chu, Yunzhuo",Infect Drug Resist,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34054300/; https://doi.org/10.2147/idr.s311968,344

DESIGN: This was a multicentre retrospective cross-sectional descriptive study. SETTING: The medical records generated in three temporary military hospitals in Wuhan. PARTICIPANTS: Medical records of 2702 inpatients generated from 5 February to 5 April 2020 were randomly selected for this study. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: DWs of COVID-19 symptoms were determined by the person trade-off approach. The inpatients’ medical records were analysed and used to calculate the disability-adjusted life years (DALYs). The mean DALY was evaluated across sex and age groups. The relationship between DALY and age, sex, body mass index, length of hospital stay, symptom duration before admission and native place was determined by multiple linear regression. RESULTS: For the DALY of each inpatient, severe expiratory dyspnoea, mild cough and sore throat had the highest (0.399) and lowest (0.004) weights, respectively. The average synthetic DALY and daily DALY were 2.29±1.33 and 0.18±0.15 days, respectively. Fever and fatigue contributed the most DALY at 31.36%, whereas nausea and vomiting and anxiety and depression contributed the least at 7.05%. There were significant differences between sex and age groups in both synthetic and daily DALY. Age, body mass index, length of hospital stay and symptom duration before admission were strongly related to both synthetic and daily DALY. CONCLUSIONS: Although the disease burden was higher among women than men, their daily disease burdens were similar. The disease burden in the younger population was higher than that in the older population. Treatment at the hospitals relieved the disease burden efficiently, while a delay in hospitalisation worsened it.","He, Maihong; Li, Xiaoxiao; Tan, Qing; Chen, Yong; Kong, Yue; You, Jianping; Lin, Xian; Lin, Ying; Zheng, Qing",BMJ Open,https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2021-048822; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34006559/,344

This study aims to determine how exposure to information sources, knowledge and behaviours potentially influenced risk perceptions during the 2014–2015 Ebola Virus Disease outbreak in Sierra Leone. METHODS: The study is based on three cross-sectional, national surveys (August 2014, n = 1413; October 2014, n = 2086; December 2014, n = 3540) that measured Ebola-related knowledge, attitudes, and practices in Sierra Leone. Data were pooled and composite variables were created for knowledge, misconceptions and three Ebola-specific behaviours. Risk perception was measured using a Likert-item and dichotomised into ‘no risk perception’ and ‘some risk perception’. Exposure to five information sources was dichotomised into a binary variable for exposed and unexposed. Multilevel logistic regression models were fitted to examine various associations. RESULTS: Exposure to new media (e.g. internet) and community-level information sources (e.g. religious leaders) were positively associated with expressing risk perception. Ebola-specific knowledge and hand washing were positively associated with expressing risk perception (Adjusted OR [AOR] 1.4, 95% Confidence Interval [CI] 1.2–1.8 and AOR 1.4, 95% CI 1.1–1.7 respectively), whereas misconceptions and avoiding burials were negatively associated with risk perception, (AOR 0.7, 95% CI 0.6–0.8 and AOR 0.8, 95% CI 06–1.0, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Our results illustrate the complexity of how individuals perceived their Ebola acquisition risk based on the way they received information, what they knew about Ebola, and actions they took to protect themselves. Community-level information sources may help to align the public’s perceived risk with their actual epidemiological risk. As part of global health security efforts, increased investments are needed for community-level engagements that allow for two-way communication during health emergencies.","Winters, Maike; Jalloh, Mohamed F.; Sengeh, Paul; Jalloh, Mohammad B.; Zeebari, Zangin; Nordenstedt, Helena",BMC Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33046052/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12889-020-09648-8,344

We summarize a paradigm shift over the last 3 years in the field of interferon (IFN)-inducible antiviral Mx-family GTPases. Expression of the ‘myxovirus resistance proteins’ MxA in human cells and its ortholog Mx1 in murine cells is increased 50- to 100-fold by Type I (IFN-α and -β) and III IFNs (IFN-λ). Human MxA forms cytoplasmic structures, while murine Mx1 forms nuclear bodies. Since 2002, it has been widely thought that human (Hu) MxA is associated with the membraneous smooth endoplasmic reticulum (ER). In a paradigm shift, our recent data showed that HuMxA formed membraneless phase-separated biomolecular condensates in the cytoplasm. Some of the HuMxA condensates adhered to intermediate filaments generating a reticular pattern. Murine (Mu) Mx1, which was predominantly nuclear, was also confirmed to be in phase-separated nuclear biomolecular condensates. A subset of Huh7 cells showed association of GFP-MuMx1 with intermediate filaments in the cytoplasm. While cells with cytoplasmic GFP-HuMxA condensates and cytoplasmic GFP-MuMx1 filaments showed an antiviral phenotype towards vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), those with only nuclear GFP-MuMx1 bodies did not. The new data bring forward the paradigm that both human MxA and murine Mx1 give rise to phase-separated biomolecular condensates, albeit in different subcellular compartments, and that differences in the subcellular localization of condensates of different Mx proteins determines the spectrum of their antiviral activity.","Sehgal, Pravin B",J Biosci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34323222/,344

Patients with cirrhosis have a high symptom burden, significant comorbidities, and a range of psychological and cognitive issues. Patients with cirrhosis were assessed for their readiness and interest in e-health. Adults attending one of two outpatient cirrhosis clinics in Alberta were recruited. Eligible participants were not required to own or have experience with digital technologies or the Internet. Medical history, socioeconomic status, and attitudes regarding e-health, the Computer Proficiency Questionnaire, and the Mobile Device Proficiency Questionnaire were used to describe participants’ knowledge and skills. Of the 117 recruited patients, 68.4% owned a computer and 84.6% owned a mobile device. Patients had mean proficiency scores of 72.8% (SD 25.9%) and 69.3% (SD 26.4%) for these devices, respectively. In multiple regression analyses, significant predictors of device proficiency were age, education, and household income. Most patients (78.7%) were confident they could participate in videoconferencing after training and most (61.5%) were interested in an online personalized health management program. This diverse group of patients with cirrhosis had technology ownership, proficiency, and online behaviours similar to the general population. Moreover, the patients were very receptive to e-health if training was provided.

It is useful for controlling caries in challenging patients such as those with special health care needs (SHCN). First aim of this study was to assess parents’ acceptance towards using SDF in SHCN children in their primary and permanent teeth. Second aim was to determine the factors that influence parents’ decisions toward dental treatment options. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This descriptive cross-sectional study included the parents of SHCN children aged 12 years old and younger who were actively seen in pediatric dentistry clinic at King Fahad Medical City (KFMC) and were receiving dental treatment. A previously developed and tested questionnaire was used. The surveyors received training about the questionnaire and participants’ consent was obtained before enrolling in the survey. The statistical significance level was set at P<0.05. RESULTS: Two hundred twelve participants completed the study questionnaire. Parents had a higher acceptance of SDF use regardless of the tooth location and type when their child had a positive history of pain and/or inflammation (P=0.019). In addition, parents had higher acceptance of SDF staining in primary teeth compared to permanent teeth (P=0.006). Moreover, the acceptance of SDF staining was higher in posterior teeth compared to anterior teeth in both primary and permanent dentition (P<0.001). CONCLUSION: Parental acceptance of SDF was higher for primary compared to permanent teeth and posterior compared to anterior teeth in both dentitions, as well as for those with a positive history of dental pain and/or inflammation.","Almarwan, Marwah; Almawash, Amjad; AlBrekan, AlHanouf; Albluwi, Sarah",Clin Cosmet Investig Dent,https://doi.org/10.2147/ccide.s307190; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34054310/,344

By evaluating effects of different non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs), the research expects to provide references to other countries for formulating corresponding policies. This article divides all non-pharmaceutical interventions into three types according to their different roles. The results show that type-A and type-B non-pharmaceutical interventions both can delay the timing of large-scale infections of the susceptible population, timing of the number of exposed individuals to peak, and timing of peaking of the number of infected cases, as well as decrease the peak number of exposed cases. Moreover, type-B non-pharmaceutical interventions have more significant effects on susceptible and exposed populations. Type-C non-pharmaceutical interventions for improving the recovery rate of patients are able to effectively reduce the peak number of patients, greatly decrease the slope of the curve for the number of infected cases, substantially improve the recovery rate, and lower the mortality rate; however, these non-pharmaceutical interventions do not greatly delay the timing of the number of infected cases to peak. And based on the above analysis, we proposed some suggestions.","Shou, Ming-Huan; Wang, Zheng-Xin; Lou, Wen-Qian",Technol Forecast Soc Change,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0040162521004194?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.techfore.2021.120987; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0040162521004194; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34176979/,344

Thereafter, the Jingmen tick virus (JMTV), Kindia tick virus (KITV), and Guangxi tick virus (GXTV)—evolutionarily related to MGTV—were reported. RESULTS: In the present study, we used small RNA sequencing (sRNA-seq) to detect viruses in ticks and discovered a new MGTV strain in Amblyomma testudinarium ticks collected in China’s Yunnan Province in 2016. We obtained the full-length genome sequence of this MGTV strain Yunnan2016 (GenBank: MT080097, MT080098, MT080099 and MT080100) and recommended it for its inclusion in the NCBI RefSeq database for future studies on MGTV, JMTV, KITV and GXTV. Phylogenetic analysis showed that MGTV, JMTV, KITV and GXTV are monophyletic and belong to a MGTV group. Furthermore, this MGTV group of viruses may be phylogenetically related to geographical regions that were formerly part of the supercontinents Gondwana and Laurasia. CONCLUSIONS: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study in which 5′ and 3′ sRNAs were used to generate full-length genome sequences of, but not limited to, RNA viruses. We also demonstrated the feasibility of using the sRNA-seq based method for the detection of viruses in pooled two and even possible one small ticks. MGTV may preserve the characteristic of ancient RNA viruses, which can be used to study the origin and evolution of RNA viruses. In addition, MGTV can be used as novel species for studies in phylogeography.","Xu, Xiaofeng; Bei, Jinlong; Xuan, Yibo; Chen, Jiayuan; Chen, Defu; Barker, Stephen C.; Kelava, Samuel; Zhang, Xiaoai; Gao, Shan; Chen, Ze",BMC Genomics,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32938401/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12864-020-07060-5,344

METHODS: We examined the impact of COVID-19 on household and child food security in three preexisting, longitudinal, Latinx urban cohorts in the San Francisco Bay Area (N = 375 households, 1875 individuals). Households were initially recruited during pregnancy and postpartum at Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital (ZSFG) and UCSF Benioff prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. For this COVID-19 sub-study, participants responded to a 15-min telephonic interview. Participants answered 18 questions from the US Food Security Food Module (US HFSSM) and questions on types of food consumption, housing and employment status, and history of COVID-19 infection as per community or hospital-based testing. Food security and insecurity levels were compared with prior year metrics. RESULTS: We found low levels of household food security in Latinx families (by cohort: 29.2%; 34.2%; 60.0%) and child food security (56.9%, 54.1%, 78.0%) with differences between cohorts explained by self-reported levels of education and employment status. Food security levels were much lower than those reported previously in two cohorts where data had been recorded from prior years. Reported history of COVID-19 infection in households was 4.8% (95% Confidence Interval (CI); 1.5–14.3%); 7.2% (95%CI, 3.6–13.9%) and 3.5% (95%CI, 1.7–7.2%) by cohort and was associated with food insecurity in the two larger cohorts (p = 0.03; p = 0.01 respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Latinx families in the Bay Area with children are experiencing a sharp rise in food insecurity levels during the COVID-19 epidemic. Food insecurity, similar to other indices of poverty, is associated with increased risk for COVID-19 infection. Comprehensive interventions are needed to address food insecurity in Latinx populations and further studies are needed to better assess independent associations between household food insecurity, poor nutritional health and risk of COVID-19 infection.

The ability to efficiently and accurately classify physiological states based on wearable devices is improving. However, the inherent variability of human behavior within and across individuals makes it challenging to predict how identified states influence human performance outcomes of relevance to military operations and other high-stakes domains. We describe a computational modeling approach to address this challenge, seeking to translate user states obtained from a variety of sources including wearable devices into relevant and actionable insights across the cognitive and physical domains. Three status predictors were considered: stress level, sleep status, and extent of physical exertion; these independent variables were used to predict three human performance outcomes: reaction time, executive function, and perceptuo-motor control. The approach provides a complete, conditional probabilistic model of the performance variables given the status predictors. Construction of the model leverages diverse raw data sources to estimate marginal probability density functions for each of six independent and dependent variables of interest using parametric modeling and maximum likelihood estimation. The joint distributions among variables were optimized using an adaptive LASSO approach based on the strength and directionality of conditional relationships (effect sizes) derived from meta-analyses of extant research. The model optimization process converged on solutions that maintain the integrity of the original marginal distributions and the directionality and robustness of conditional relationships. The modeling framework described provides a flexible and extensible solution for human performance prediction, affording efficient expansion with additional independent and dependent variables of interest, ingestion of new raw data, and extension to two- and three-way interactions among independent variables. Continuing work includes model expansion to multiple independent and dependent variables, real-time model stimulation by wearable devices, individualized and small-group prediction, and laboratory and field validation.","Brunyé, Tad T.; Yau, Kenny; Okano, Kana; Elliott, Grace; Olenich, Sara; Giles, Grace E.; Navarro, Ester; Elkin-Frankston, Seth; Young, Alexander L.; Miller, Eric L.",Front Physiol,https://doi.org/10.3389/fphys.2021.738973; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34566701/,344

In addition, it is believed to function as a defense against viruses and transposons. In recent years, RNAi has become a widely used approach for studying gene function by targeted cleavage of a specific RNA. Moreover, the technology has been developed as a new therapeutic option that has already made its way into clinical testing. Treatment of viral infections remains a serious challenge due to the emergence of new viruses and strain variation among known virus species. RNAi holds great promise to provide a flexible approach that can rapidly be adapted to new viral target sequences. A major challenge in the development of an efficient RNAi approach still remains the design of small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) with high silencing potency. While large libraries with validated siRNAs exist for silencing of endogenously expressed genes in human or murine cells, siRNAs still have to be designed individually for new antiviral approaches. The present chapter describes strategies to design highly potent siRNAs by taking into consideration thermodynamic features of the siRNA, as well as the structural restrictions of the target RNA. Furthermore, assays for testing the siRNAs in reporter assays as well as options to improve the properties of siRNAs by the introduction of modified nucleotides will be described. Finally, experimental setups will be outlined to test the siRNAs in assays with infectious viruses.","Rothe, Diana; Wade, Erik J.; Kurreck, Jens",Antiviral RNAi,https://doi.org/10.1007/978-1-61779-037-9_17; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21431692/,344

This family of innate cytokines are increasingly being ascribed pivotal roles in host–pathogen interactions. Herein, we will review the accumulating evidence detailing the immune biology of IFNL during viral infection, and the implications of this novel information on means to advance the development of therapies and vaccines against existing and emerging pathogens. IFNLs exert antiviral effects via induction of IFN-stimulated genes. Common single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the IFNL3, IFNL4 and the IFNL receptor α-subunit genes have been strongly associated with IFN-α-based treatment of chronic hepatitis C virus infection. The clinical impact of these SNPs may be dependent on the status of viral infection (acute or chronic) and the potential to develop viral resistance. Another important function of IFNLs is macrophage and dendritic cell polarization, which prime helper T-cell activation and proliferation. It has been demonstrated that IFNL increase Th1- and reduce Th2-cytokines. Therefore, can such SNPs affect the IFNL signaling and thereby modulate the Th1/Th2 balance during infection? In turn, this may influence the subsequent priming of cytotoxic T cells versus antibody-secreting B cells, with implications for the breadth and durability of the host response.","Egli, Adrian; Santer, Deanna M; O'Shea, Daire; Tyrrell, D Lorne; Houghton, Michael",Emerg Microbes Infect,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26038748/; https://doi.org/10.1038/emi.2014.51,344

Characterization of response heterogeneity and their underlying associations may assist in stratifying the health impact of the pandemic. METHODS: We obtained wearable data covering baseline, incremental mobility restriction, and lockdown periods from 1,824 city-dwelling, working adults aged 21–40 years, incorporating 206,381 nights of sleep and 334,038 days of PA. Distinct rest-activity rhythm (RAR) profiles were identified using k-means clustering, indicating participants’ temporal distribution of step counts over the day. Hierarchical clustering of the proportion of days spent in each of these RAR profiles revealed four groups who expressed different mixtures of RAR profiles before and during the lockdown. RESULTS: Time in bed increased by 20 min during the lockdown without loss of sleep efficiency, while social jetlag measures decreased by 15 min. Resting heart rate declined by ~2 bpm. PA dropped an average of 42%. Four groups with different compositions of RAR profiles were found. Three were better able to maintain PA and weekday/weekend differentiation during lockdown. The least active group comprising ~51% of the sample, were younger and predominantly singles. Habitually less active already, this group showed the greatest reduction in PA during lockdown with little weekday/weekend differences. CONCLUSION: In the early aftermath of COVID-19 mobility restriction, PA appears to be more severely affected than sleep. RAR evaluation uncovered heterogeneity of responses to lockdown that could associate with different outcomes should the resolution of COVID-19 be protracted.","Ong, Ju Lynn; Lau, TeYang; Massar, Stijn A A; Chong, Zhi Ting; Ng, Ben K L; Koek, Daphne; Zhao, Wanting; Yeo, B T Thomas; Cheong, Karen; Chee, Michael W L",Sleep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32918076/; https://doi.org/10.1093/sleep/zsaa179,344

Objectives: To examine the associations between all-cause mortality and daily PM2.5, PM2.5-10, and PM10 in the pandemic period, and compare them to the normal periods (2015-2019) in Italy. Methods: We collected daily data regarding all-cause (stratified by age and gender), and PM2.5, PM2.5-10, and PM10 for 107 Italian provinces from 1, January 2015 to 31, May 2020. A time-stratified case-cross design with the distributed lag non-linear model was used to examine the association between PM and all-cause mortality during the first three months of the COVID-19 outbreak (March to May in 2020) and the same months in 2015-2019. We also compared the counts and fractions of death attributable to PM in two periods. Results: Overall, Italy saw an increase in daily death counts while slight decreases in PM concentrations in 2020 pandemic period compared to same months of 2015-2019. Mortality effects were significant in lag 0-3 days for PM2.5, lag 0-2 for PM10, and lag 0-1 for PM2.5-10. Each 10 g/m3 increase in PM was associated much higher increase in daily all-cause mortality during 2020 pandemic period compared to the same months during 2015-2019 [increased mortality rate: 7.24 % (95%CI: 4.84%, 9.70%) versus 1.69% (95%CI: 1.12%, 2.25%) for PM2.5; 3.45 % (95%C: 2.58%, 4.34%) versus 1.11% (95%CI: 0.79%, 1.42%) for PM10, 4.25% (95%CI: 2.99%, 5.52%) versus 1.76% (95%CI: 1.14%, 2.38%) for PM2.5-10]. The counts and fractions of deaths attributable to PM were higher in 2020 than the normal periods for PM2.5 (attributable death counts: 20,062 in 2020 versus 3,927 per year in 2015-2019; attributable fractions: 10.2% versus 2.4%), PM10 (15,112 versus 3,999; 7.7% versus 2.5%), and PM2.5-10 (7,193 versus 2303; 3.7% versus 1.4%). Conclusions: COVID-19 pandemic increased the vulnerability and excess cases of all-cause mortality associated with short-term exposure to PM2.5, PM2.5-10 and PM10 in Italy, despite a decline in air pollution level.

Infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 was confirmed by reverse transcription PCR in samples collected 116 days apart. Whole-genome sequencing revealed that the 2 infections were caused by the most prevalent lineage in Brazil, B.1.1.33, and the emerging lineage P.2. The first infection occurred in June 2020; Bayesian analysis suggests reinfection at some point during September 14–October 11, 2020, a few days before the second episode of coronavirus disease.

654823,Comparing early outbreak detection algorithms based on their optimized parameter values,2009-08-13,"The COVID-19 pandemic has caused a complementary infodemic, whereby various outlets and digital media portals shared false information and unsourced recommendations on health. In addition, journals and authors published a mass of academic articles at a speed that suggests a non-existent or a non-rigorous peer review process. Such lapses can promote false information and adoption of health policies based on misleading data. Reliable information is vital for designing and implementing preventive measures and promoting health awareness in the fight against COVID-19. In the age of social media, information travels wide and fast, emphasizing a need for accurate data to be corroborated swiftly and for preventing misleading information from wide dissemination. Here, we discuss the implications of the COVID-19 infodemic and explore practical ways to leverage health communication strategies to overcome it. We propose the “Infodemic Response Checklist” as a comprehensive tool to overcome the challenges posed by the current and any future infodemics.

656268,Single-Use Plastics and COVID-19: Scientific Evidence and Environmental Regulations,2020-06-08,"Viral respiratory diseases (VRDs), such as influenza and COVID-19, are thought to spread faster over winter than during summer. It has been previously argued that cold and dry conditions were more conducive to the transmission of VRD than warm and humid climates, although this relationship appears restricted to temperate regions, and the causal relationship is not well understood. The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) causing COVID-19 has emerged as a serious global public health problem after the first COVID-19 reports in Wuhan, China, in late 2019. It is still unclear whether this novel respiratory disease will ultimately prove to be a seasonal endemic disease. Here, we suggest that Air Drying Capacity (ADC; an atmospheric state-variable known to control the fate/evolution of the virus-laden droplets) and ultraviolet radiation (UV) are probable environmental determinants in shaping the transmission of COVID-19 at the seasonal time scale. These variables, unlike temperature and humidity, provide a physically-based framework consistent with the apparent seasonal variability in COVID-19 prevalence across a broad range of climates (e.g., Germany and India). Since this disease is known to be influenced by the compounding effect of social, biological, and environmental determinants, this study does not claim that these environmental determinants exclusively shape the seasonality of COVID-19. However, we argue that ADC and UV play a significant role in COVID-19 dynamics at the seasonal scale. These findings could help guide the development of a sound adaptation strategy against the pandemic over the coming seasons.","Choi, Y.-W.; Tuel, A.; Eltahir, E. A.

656954,‘Shining a light on the gaps for learning’,2020-07-05,"BACKGROUND: For the rising number of people living with dementia, cost-effective community-based interventions to support psychosocial care are needed. The FindMyApps intervention has been developed with and for people with dementia and their caregivers, to help them use tablets to facilitate self-management and engagement in meaningful social activities. A feasibility study and exploratory pilot trial evaluating FindMyApps have been carried out. This definitive trial further evaluates the effectiveness of the intervention and, for the first time, the cost-effectiveness. METHODS: A randomized controlled non-blinded single-center two-arm superiority trial will be conducted. Community-dwelling people with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), or dementia with a Mini Mental-State Examination (MMSE) of > 17 and < 26, or Global Deterioration Scale 3 or 4, with an informal caregiver and access to a wireless internet connection will be included. In total, 150 patient-caregiver dyads will be randomly allocated to receive either usual care (control arm – tablet computer; n = 75 dyads) or usual care and the FindMyApps intervention (experimental arm – tablet computer and FindMyApps; n = 75 dyads). The primary outcomes are: for people with dementia, self-management and social participation; for caregivers, sense of competence. In addition to a main effect analysis, a cost-effectiveness analysis will be performed. In line with MRC guidance for evaluation of complex interventions a process evaluation will also be undertaken. DISCUSSION: Results of the trial are expected to be available in 2023 and will be submitted for publication in international peer-reviewed scientific journals, in addition to conference presentations and reporting via the EU Marie Sklodowska-Curie DISTINCT ITN network. By providing evidence for or against the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of the FindMyApps intervention, the results of the trial will influence national implementation of FindMyApps. We hope that the results of the trial will further stimulate research and development at the intersection of technology and psycho-social care in dementia. We hope to further demonstrate that the randomized controlled trial is a valuable and feasible means of evaluating new digital technologies, to stimulate further high-quality research in this growing field.

It plays an important role in traditional health care and disease treatment, as its aboveground stems and leaves have a long medicinal history in China and are used in the treatment of pneumonia and lung abscess. In clinical treatment, it can usually be combined with other drugs to treat dysentery, cold, fever, and mumps; additionally, H. cordata is an edible plant. This review summarizes detailed information on the phytochemistry and pharmacological effects of H. cordata. By searching the keywords “H. cordata and lung”, “H. cordata and heart”, “H. cordata and liver”, and “H. cordata and inflammation” in PubMed, Web of Science and ScienceDirect, we screened out articles with high correlation in the past ten years, sorted out the research contents, disease models and research methods of the articles, and provided a new perspective on the therapeutic effects of H. cordata. A variety of its chemical constituents are characteristic of medicinal plants, the chemical constituents were isolated from H. cordata, including volatile oils, alkaloids, flavonoids, and phenolic acids. Flavonoids and volatile oils are the main active components. In pharmacological studies, H. cordata showed organ protective activity, such as reducing the release of inflammatory factors to alleviate lung injury. Moreover, H. cordata regulates immunity, enhances the immune barriers of the vagina, oral cavity, and intestinal tract, and combined with the antibacterial and antiviral activity of its extract, effectively reduces pathogen infection. Furthermore, experiments in vivo and in vitro showed significant anti-inflammatory activity, and its chemical derivatives exert potential therapeutic activity against rheumatoid arthritis. Antitumour action is also an important pharmacological activity of H. cordata, and studies have shown that H. cordata has a notable effect on lung tumour, liver tumour, colon tumour, and breast tumour. This review categorizes the biological activities of H. cordata according to modern research papers, and provides insights into disease prevention and treatment of H. cordata.","Wu, Zhao; Deng, Xinyu; Hu, Qichao; Xiao, Xiaolin; Jiang, Jing; Ma, Xiao; Wu, Mingquan",Front Pharmacol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34539401/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fphar.2021.714694,344

This is even more true for highly contagious diseases such as COVID-19, known to be caused by the new coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. Mathematical models of epidemics allow estimating several impacts on the population and, therefore, are of great use for the definition of public health policies. Some of these measures include the isolation of the infected (also known as quarantine), and the vaccination of the susceptible. In a possible scenario in which a vaccine is available, but with limited access, it is necessary to quantify the levels of vaccination to be applied, taking into account the continued application of preventive measures. This work concerns the simulation of the spread of the COVID-19 disease in a community by applying the Monte Carlo method to a Susceptible-Exposed-Infective-Recovered (SEIR) stochastic epidemic model. To handle the computational effort involved, a simple parallelization approach was adopted and deployed in a small HPC cluster. The developed computational method allows to realistically simulate the spread of COVID-19 in a medium-sized community and to study the effect of preventive measures such as quarantine and vaccination. The results show that an effective combination of vaccination with quarantine can prevent the appearance of major epidemic outbreaks, even if the critical vaccination coverage is not reached.","Balsa, Carlos; Lopes, Isabel; Guarda, Teresa; Rufino, José",Comput Math Organ Theory,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10588-021-09327-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33814968/,344

Preliminary data on SARS-CoV-2 infection suggest that some immunocompromised hosts experience worse outcomes. We performed a retrospective matched cohort study to characterize outcomes in HIV-positive patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. METHODS: Leveraging data collected from electronic medical records for all patients hospitalized at NYU Langone Health with COVID-19 between March 2, 2020, and April 23, 2020, we matched 21 HIV-positive patients with 42 non-HIV patients using a greedy nearest-neighbor algorithm. Admission characteristics, laboratory test results, and hospital outcomes were recorded and compared between the 2 groups. RESULTS: Although there was a trend toward increased rates of intensive care unit admission, mechanical ventilation, and mortality in HIV-positive patients, these differences were not statistically significant. Rates for these outcomes in our cohort are similar to those previously published for all patients hospitalized with COVID-19. HIV-positive patients had significantly higher admission and peak C-reactive protein values. Other inflammatory markers did not differ significantly between groups, although HIV-positive patients tended to have higher peak values during their clinical course. Three HIV-positive patients had superimposed bacterial pneumonia with positive sputum cultures, and all 3 patients died during hospitalization. There was no difference in frequency of thrombotic events or myocardial infarction between these groups. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides evidence that HIV coinfection does not significantly impact presentation, hospital course, or outcomes of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2, when compared with matched non-HIV patients.

Methods We analysed prospectively collected, pseudonymised data on 959,356 employees who were continuously employed by NHS trusts during 1 January 2019 to 31 July 2020, comparing the frequency of new sickness absence in 2020 with that at corresponding times in 2019. Results After exclusion of episodes directly related to COVID-19, the overall incidence of sickness absence during the initial 10 weeks of the pandemic (March-May 2020) was more than 20% lower than in corresponding weeks of 2019, but trends for specific categories of illness varied. Marked increases were observed for asthma (122%), infectious diseases (283%) and mental illness (42.3%), while reductions were apparent for gastrointestinal problems (48.4%), genitourinary/gynaecological disorders (33.8%), eye problems (42.7%), injury and fracture (27.7%), back problems (19.6%), other musculoskeletal disorders (29.3%), disorders of ear, nose and throat (32.7%), cough/flu (24.5%) and cancer (24.1%). A doubling of new absences for pregnancy-related disorders during 18 May to 19 July of 2020 was limited to women with earlier COVID-19 sickness absence. Conclusions Various factors will have contributed to the large and divergent changes that were observed. The findings add to concerns regarding delays in diagnosis and treatment of cancers, and support a need to plan for a large backlog of treatment for many other diseases. Further research should explore the rise in absence for pregnancy-related disorders among women with earlier COVID-19 sickness absence.","Edge, R.; van der Plaat, D.

Worldwide many countries implemented quarantine policies to minimize the spread of this highly contagious disease. The present study aim was to investigate the impact of quarantine on the medical students’ mental wellbeing and learning behaviors. METHODS: In this descriptive study, we used a questionnaire with a Five-Point Likert Scale to collect the information. The questionnaire was distributed among 625 medical students through their emails with a response rate of 530 (84.8%), majority 294 (55.47%) being female. The survey questionnaire consisted of total 20 items; 12 items were related to psychological wellbeing and stress-allied queries and 08 items were about learning behaviors. RESULTS: The findings encompass two important characteristics related to quarantine, psychological wellbeing, and learning behaviors. A combined cohort of 234 medical students, either female or male, (which was 44.1% of the total responders) showed a sense of being emotionally detached from family, friends and fellow students, 125/ 530 (23.5%) medical students felt disheartened. Both female and male medical students showed a marked decrease in their overall work performance. Moreover, 56.2% of the total students (61.5% of the females and 49.5% of the males) felt a decrease in the time they spent studying. CONCLUSIONS: Both female and male medical students have identified that quarantine has caused them to feel emotionally detached from family, fellows, and friends and decrease their overall work performance and study period. The findings also show that one fourth of the medical students who participated in this study felt disheartened during the quarantine period.

Prior studies have demonstrated that local socioeconomic and built environment characteristics may significantly contribute to viral transmission and incidence rates, thereby accounting for some of the spatial variation observed. Due to uncertainties, non-linearities, and multiple interaction effects observed in the associations between COVID-19 incidence and socioeconomic, infrastructural, and built environment characteristics, we present a structured multimethod approach for analysing cross-sectional incidence data within in an Exploratory Spatial Data Analysis (ESDA) framework at the NUTS3 (county) scale. METHODS: By sequentially conducting a geospatial analysis, an heuristic geographical interpretation, a Bayesian machine learning analysis, and parameterising a Generalised Additive Model (GAM), we assessed associations between incidence rates and 368 independent variables describing geographical patterns, socioeconomic risk factors, infrastructure, and features of the build environment. A spatial trend analysis and Local Indicators of Spatial Autocorrelation were used to characterise the geography of age-adjusted COVID-19 incidence rates across Germany, followed by iterative modelling using Bayesian Additive Regression Trees (BART) to identify and measure candidate explanatory variables. Partial dependence plots were derived to quantify and contextualise BART model results, followed by the parameterisation of a GAM to assess correlations. RESULTS: A strong south-to-north gradient of COVID-19 incidence was identified, facilitating an empirical classification of the study area into two epidemic subregions. All preliminary and final models indicated that location, densities of the built environment, and socioeconomic variables were important predictors of incidence rates in Germany. The top ten predictor variables’ partial dependence exhibited multiple non-linearities in the relationships between key predictor variables and COVID-19 incidence rates. The BART, partial dependence, and GAM results indicate that the strongest predictors of COVID-19 incidence at the county scale were related to community interconnectedness, geographical location, transportation infrastructure, and labour market structure. CONCLUSIONS: The multimethod ESDA approach provided unique insights into spatial and aspatial non-stationarities of COVID-19 incidence in Germany. BART and GAM modelling indicated that geographical configuration, built environment densities, socioeconomic characteristics, and infrastructure all exhibit associations with COVID-19 incidence in Germany when assessed at the county scale. The results suggest that measures to implement social distancing and reduce unnecessary travel may be important methods for reducing contagion, and the authors call for further research to investigate the observed associations to inform prevention and control policy.","Scarpone, Christopher; Brinkmann, Sebastian T.; Große, Tim; Sonnenwald, Daniel; Fuchs, Martin; Walker, Blake Byron",Int J Health Geogr,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32791994/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12942-020-00225-1,344

OBJECTIVE: To describe and intercorrelate epidemiology and geographic data from Brazil about the number of intensive care unit (ICU) beds at the onset of COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: The epidemiology and geographic data were correlated with the distribution of ICU beds (public and private health systems) and the number of beneficiaries of private health insurance using Pearson’s Correlation Coefficient. The same data were correlated using partial correlation controlled by gross domestic product (GDP) and number of beneficiaries of private health insurance. FINDINGS: Brazil has a large geographical area and diverse demographic and economic aspects. This diversity is also present in the states and the Federal District regarding the number of COVID-19 cases, deaths and case fatality rate. The effective management of severe COVID-19 patients requires ICU services, and the scenario was also dissimilar as for ICU beds and ICU beds/10,000 inhabitants for the public (SUS) and private health systems mainly at the onset of COVID-19 pandemic. The distribution of ICUs was uneven between public and private services, and most patients rely on SUS, which had the lowest number of ICU beds. In only a few states, the number of ICU beds at SUS was above 1 to 3 by 10,000 inhabitants, which is the number recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO). CONCLUSIONS: Brazil needed to improve the number of ICU beds units to deal with COVID-19 pandemic, mainly for the SUS showing a late involvement of government and health authorities to deal with the COVID-19 pandemic.","Palamim, Camila Vantini Capasso; Marson, Fernando Augusto Lima",Annals of global health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32864352/; https://doi.org/10.5334/aogh.3025,344

This is especially relevant given that approximately 60% of maternal deaths are considered preventable.(1–36) Interventions that leverage health IT tools to target the underlying drivers of disparities at the patient, clinician, and health care system levels potentially could reduce disparities in quality of care throughout the continuum (antepartum, intrapartum, and postpartum) of maternity care. This article presents an overview of the research (and gaps) on the potential of health IT tools to document SDoH and community-level geocoded data in EHR-based CDS systems, minimize implicit bias, and improve adherence to clinical guidelines and coordinated care to inform multilevel (patient, clinician, system) interventions throughout the continuum of maternity care for health disparity populations impacted by MMM.

New, larger genetic association studies now allow additional genetic risk factors to be discovered. Using data from the Genetics of Mortality in Critical Care (GenOMICC) consortium, we show that a haplotype at a region on chromosome 12 associated with requiring intensive care when infected with the virus is inherited from Neandertals. This region encodes proteins that activate enzymes that are important during infections with RNA viruses. In contrast to the previously described Neandertal haplotype that increases the risk for severe COVID-19, this Neandertal haplotype is protective against severe disease. It also differs from the risk haplotype in that it has a more moderate effect and occurs at substantial frequencies in all regions of the world outside Africa. Among ancient human genomes in western Eurasia, the frequency of the protective Neandertal haplotype may have increased between 20,000 and 10,000 y ago and again during the past 1,000 y.","Zeberg, Hugo; Pääbo, Svante",Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33593941/; https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2026309118,344
668884,Toxicology Advances for 21st Century Chemical Pollution,2020-04-24,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has negatively impacted individuals with eating disorders; resulting in increased symptoms, as well as feelings of isolation and anxiety. To conform with social distancing requirements, outpatient eating disorder treatment in Canada is being delivered virtually, but a lack of direction surrounding this change creates challenges for practitioners, patients, and families. As a result, there is an urgent need to not only adapt evidence-based care, including family-based treatment (FBT), to virtual formats, but to study its implementation in eating disorder programs. We propose to study the initial adaptation and adoption of virtual family-based treatment (vFBT) with the ultimate goal of improving access to services for youth with eating disorders. METHODS: We will use a multi-site case study with a mixed method pre/post design to examine the impact of our implementation approach across four pediatric eating disorder programs. We will develop implementation teams at each site (consisting of therapists, medical practitioners, and program administrators), provide a remote training workshop on vFBT, and offer ongoing consultation during the initial implementation phase. Therapists will submit videorecordings of their first four vFBT sessions. We propose to study our implementation approach by examining (1) whether the key components of standard FBT are maintained in virtual delivery measured by therapist self-report, (2) fidelity to our vFBT model measured by expert fidelity rating of submitted videorecordings of the first four sessions of vFBT, (3) team and patient/family experiences with vFBT assessed with qualitative interviews, and (4) patient outcomes measured by weight and binge/purge frequency reported by therapists. DISCUSSION: To our knowledge, this is the first study to evaluate an implementation strategy for virtually delivered FBT for eating disorders. Challenges to date include confirming site participation and obtaining ethics approval at all locations. This research is imperative to inform the delivery of vFBT in the COVID-19 context. It also has implications for delivery in a post-pandemic era where virtual services may be preferable to patients and families living in remote locations, where access to specialized services is extremely limited.

As research becomes ever more international, establishing international collaborations will be key to advancing our scientific knowledge. Understanding the similarities in standards applied by different nations to animal research, and where the differences might lie, is crucial. Cultural differences and societal values will also contribute to these similarities and differences between countries and continents. Our overview is not comprehensive for all species, but rather focuses on non-human primate (NHP) research, involving New World marmosets and Old World macaques, conducted in countries where NHPs are involved in neuroimaging research. Here, an overview of the ethics and regulations is provided to help assess welfare standards amongst primate research institutions. A comparative examination of these standards was conducted to provide a basis for establishing a common set of standards for animal welfare. These criteria may serve to develop international guidelines, which can be managed by an International Animal Welfare and Use Committee (IAWUC). Internationally, scientists have a moral responsibility to ensure excellent care and welfare of their animals, which in turn, influences the quality of their research. When working with animal models, maintaining a high quality of care (“culture of care”) and welfare is essential. The transparent promotion of this level of care and welfare, along with the results of the research and its impact, may reduce public concerns associated with animal experiments in neuroscience research.","Mitchell, Anna S.; Hartig, Renée; Basso, Michele A.; Jarrett, Wendy; Kastner, Sabine; Poirier, Colline",Neuroimage,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2020.117700; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33418072/,344

The objective of the current paper is to summarize available literature on pathogens causing human disease that have been associated with wild bird species. Methods A systematic literature search was performed to identify specific pathogens known to be associated with wild and migratory birds. The evidence for direct transmission of an avian borne pathogen to a human was assessed. Transmission to humans was classified as direct if there is published evidence for such transmission from the avian species to a person or indirect if the transmission requires a vector other than the avian species. Results Several wild and migratory birds serve as reservoirs and/or mechanical vectors (simply carrying a pathogen or dispersing infected arthropod vectors) for numerous infectious agents. An association with transmission from birds to humans was identified for 10 pathogens. Wild birds including migratory species may play a significant role in the epidemiology of influenza A virus, arboviruses such as West Nile virus and enteric bacterial pathogens. Nevertheless only one case of direct transmission from wild birds to humans was found. Conclusion The available evidence suggests wild birds play a limited role in human infectious diseases. Direct transmission of an infectious agent from wild birds to humans is rarely identified. Potential factors and mechanisms involved in the transmission of infectious agents from birds to humans need further elucidation.","Tsiodras, Sotirios; Kelesidis, Theodoros; Kelesidis, Iosif; Bauchinger, Ulf; Falagas, Matthew E.",Journal of Infection,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0163445307008122; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0163445307008122; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18096237/,344

METHODS: By reinterpreting data from a previous study, the positive likelihood ratio of IgM and IgG antibodies in COVID-19 pneumonia diagnosis was calculated, and the posterior probability of IgM and IgG antibodies and their tandem detection was calculated finally. RESULTS: The positive likelihood ratios of single IgM and IgG antibodies were 18.50 and 12.65, respectively, and the posterior probabilities were 90.18% and 86.26%, respectively. However, the posterior probability of the two antibody-tandem test was 99.15%, which could give clinicians more quantitative confidence in the diagnosis of COVID-19 in suspected cases. According to the results of this study, combining the advantages and disadvantages of nucleic acid testing and antibody detection, a feasible clinical path was found for clinicians to diagnose COVID-19 pneumonia from suspected cases. CONCLUSION: For suspected cases, IgM- and IgG-antibody tests should first be done at the same time. If all antibody tests are positive, COVID-19 pneumonia could be confirmed. If not, nucleic acid detection (once or more) should be carried out, and in extreme cases high-throughput viral genome sequencing is required.","Feng, Yangchun",J Inflamm Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33328754/; https://doi.org/10.2147/jir.s287733,344
670955,Reflections on reciprocity in research,2020-07-16,"PURPOSE: To assess ocular pathologies admitted to Italian Emergency Eye Departments (EEDs) during the COVID-19 pandemic national lockdown in 2020 in comparison with the same period in 2019. METHODS: Electronic records of all patients presenting at EEDs of two tertiary-care Eye Centers during the COVID-19 national lockdown in Italy (March 10-May 3, 2020) were compared with the equivalent period in 2019. Main outcomes were patient age, gender, and diagnoses. Statistical analysis included unpaired Student t-tests, Poisson regression, and chi-square test. RESULTS: Overall EED visits significantly decreased by 54.1% during the 2020 lockdown compared to 2019 (851 vs 1854, p < 0.001). During lockdown, patients showed comparable mean age (52.8 years in 2020 vs 53.3 years in 2019, p = 0.52) and significant male gender bias (61.1% in 2020 vs 55.8% in 2019, p < 0.0001). The most frequent pathologies were eye inflammations, trauma-related incidents, and spontaneous acute vitreous detachment. Patients with inflammation, headache/hemicrania, and spontaneous subconjunctival hemorrhages were significantly less, whereas those with trauma-related diagnoses were significantly higher during the lockdown as compared with 2019 (p < 0.05). The proportion of non-urgent visits decreased from 17% in 2019 to 8% in 2020 (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: During the 2020 lockdown, there was a significant reduction of accesses to EED, especially for non-urgent pathologies. Potentially visual function threatening conditions, such as trauma-related pathologies, retinal detachment or ruptures, and wet AMD, showed lower number of cases but higher or stable proportion relative to the total caseload, suggesting a correct and efficient access to ophthalmic health care during the pandemic period.","Salvetat, Maria L; Salati, Carlo; Busatto, Patrizia; Zeppieri, Marco",Eur J Ophthalmol,https://doi.org/10.1177/11206721211028046; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34219482/,344

This paper presents differences in past year estimates of alcohol, cigarette, marijuana, and non-medical painkiller use prevalence by age, sex, and race/ethnicity between the 2012 National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH) and the National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions (NESARC-III) administered in 2012–2013. In general, estimates were higher for the NSDUH survey, but patterns of substance use prevalence were similar across race/ethnicity, age, and sex. Results show most significant differences in estimates, across substances, age groups, and sex were greatest among Hispanics, followed by non-Hispanic Whites, and non-Hispanic Blacks. Members of other racial/ethnic groups (e.g., Asian-American, Native American/Alaskan Native) were underrepresented in the NSDUH survey. In many cases, estimates for these subpopulations could not be calculated using the NSDUH data limiting our ability to draw comparisons with the NESARC estimates. Methodological differences in data collection for the NSDUH and NESARC surveys may have contributed to these findings.

673898,"Editorial Comment: Digital Physician Burnout in the ""New Normal"" Workplace",2021,"BACKGROUND: Health authorities worldwide, especially in the Asia Pacific region, are seeking effective public-health interventions in the continuing epidemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). We assessed the epidemiology of SARS in Hong Kong. METHODS: We included 1425 cases reported up to April 28, 2003. An integrated database was constructed from several sources containing information on epidemiological, demographic, and clinical variables. We estimated the key epidemiological distributions: infection to onset, onset to admission, admission to death, and admission to discharge. We measured associations between the estimated case fatality rate and patients’age and the time from onset to admission. FINDINGS: After the initial phase of exponential growth, the rate of confirmed cases fell to less than 20 per day by April 28. Public-health interventions included encouragement to report to hospital rapidly after the onset of clinical symptoms, contact tracing for confirmed and suspected cases, and quarantining, monitoring, and restricting the travel of contacts. The mean incubation period of the disease is estimated to be 6.4 days (95% Cl 5.2–7.7). The mean time from onset of clinical symptoms to admission to hospital varied between 3 and 5 days, with longer times earlier in the epidemic. The estimated case fatality rate was 13.2% (9.8–16.8) for patients younger than 60 years and 43.3% (35.2–52.4) for patients aged 60 years or older assuming a parametric γ distribution. A non-parametric method yielded estimates of 6.8% (4.0–9.6) and 55.0% (45.3–64.7), respectively. Case clusters have played an important part in the course of the epidemic. INTERPRETATION: Patients’age was strongly associated with outcome. The time between onset of symptoms and admission to hospital did not alter outcome, but shorter intervals will be important to the wider population by restricting the infectious period before patients are placed in quarantine.

Potentially, these procedures may be useful in COVID-19 treatment. The NO level in complexes with hemoglobin in blood decreases as the gNO concentration in the gas flow produced by the Plazon system increases from 100 to 2100 ppm, so that at 2000 ppm more than one-half of the gas can be incorporated into dinitrosyl complexes formed in tissues of the lungs and respiratory tract. Thus, the effect of gNO inhalation may be similar to that observed after administration of solutions of dinitrosyl iron complexes, namely, to the presence of dinitrosyl iron complexes with thiol-containing ligands in lung and airway tissues. With regard to the hypothesis posited earlier that these complexes can suppress coronavirus replication as donors of nitrosonium cations (Biophysics 65, 818, 2020), it is not inconceivable that administration of gNO or chemically synthesized dinitrosyl iron complexes with thiol-containing ligands may help treat COVID-19. In tests on the authors of this paper as volunteers, the tolerance concentration of gNO inhaled within 15 min was approximately 2000 ppm. In tests on rats that inhaled sprayed aqueous solutions of dinitrosyl iron complexes, their tolerance dose was approximately 0.4 mmol/kg body weight.","Vanin, A. F.; Pekshev, A. V.; Vagapov, A.

676258,A DEVS-based engine for building digital quadruplets,2021-04-25,"Cellular mRNA of higher eukaryotes and many viral RNA are methylated at the N-7 and 2′-O positions of the 5′ guanosine cap by specific nuclear and cytoplasmic methyltransferases (MTases), respectively. Whereas N-7 methylation is essential for RNA translation and stability 1, the function of 2′-O methylation has remained uncertain since its discovery 35 years ago 2-4. Here, we show that a West Nile virus (WNV) mutant (E218A) that lacks 2′-O MTase activity was attenuated in wild type primary cells and mice but was pathogenic in the absence of type I interferon (IFN) signaling. 2′-O methylation of viral RNA did not affect IFN induction in WNV-infected fibroblasts but instead modulated the antiviral effects of IFN-induced proteins with tetratricopeptide repeats (IFIT), which are interferon-stimulated genes (ISG) implicated in regulation of protein translation. Poxvirus and coronavirus mutants that lacked 2′-O MTase activity similarly showed enhanced sensitivity to the antiviral actions of IFN and specifically, IFIT proteins. Our results demonstrate that the 2′-O methylation of the 5′ cap of viral RNA functions to subvert innate host antiviral responses through escape of IFIT-mediated suppression, and suggest an evolutionary explanation for 2′-O methylation of cellular mRNA: to distinguish self from non-self RNA. Differential methylation of cytoplasmic RNA likely serves as a paradigm for pattern recognition and restriction of propagation of foreign viral RNA in host cells.","Daffis, Stephane; Szretter, Kristy J.; Schriewer, Jill; Li, Jianqing; Youn, Soonjeon; Errett, John; Lin, Tsai-Yu; Schneller, Stewart; Zust, Roland; Dong, Hongping; Thiel, Volker; Pierson, Theodore C.; Buller, R.

Our results demonstrate the potentials of applying PspCas13b RNP to suppress RNA virus infection, with implications in targeting host RNA as well.","Singsuksawat, Ekapot; Onnome, Suppachoke; Posiri, Pratsaneeyaporn; Suphatrakul, Amporn; Srisuk, Nittaya; Nantachokchawapan, Rapirat; Praneechit, Hansa; Sae-kow, Chutimon; Chidpratum, Pala; Hongeng, Suradej; Avirutnan, Panisadee; Duangjinda, Thaneeya; Siridechadilok, Bunpote",Mol Ther Methods Clin Dev,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2329050121000802?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2329050121000802; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.omtm.2021.04.014; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33969146/,344
677342,Optimal control of the SIR model in the presence of transmission and treatment uncertainty,2021-01-15,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic in England led to major changes in the delivery of support via stop smoking services (SSS) and to the widespread temporary closure of bricks and mortar e-cigarette retailers (vape shops herein). The impact of disruptions across the smoking cessation support landscape has not been fully documented. The purpose of this study was to capture how SSS and vape shops in England were affected and adapted their ‘business as usual’ during the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic. METHOD: An online cross-sectional survey was conducted between March and July 2020. Surveys were disseminated through online networks, professional forums and contacts. Open-ended qualitative responses were coded using thematic analysis. RESULTS: Responses from 46 SSS and 59 vape shops were included. SSS were able to adapt during this period, e.g. offering a remote service. A high percentage (74.6%) of vape shops had to close and were unable to make changes; 71.2% reported business declining. For both vape shops and SSS qualitative data revealed practical challenges to adapting, but also new pathways to support and co-working. CONCLUSION: The closure of vape shops appears to have most impacted smaller bricks and mortar shops affecting businesses by decline in customers and impacting staff (furlough). For those services that could stay open there may be lessons learned in how to support vulnerable and disadvantaged people who smoke by considering new pathways to support.","Cox, Sharon; Ward, Emma; Ross, Louise; Notley, Caitlin",Harm Reduct J,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12954-021-00541-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34465346/,344
677876,Critical Steps in Data Management During a Crisis,2020-11-24,"In this article, we sought to summarize the available evidence of tocilizumab as a treatment for coronavirus disease 2019. Recent tocilizumab randomized trials have not shown clear evidence of efficacy, especially on mortality, in contrast to observational studies. These clinical trials focus on a heterogeneous population of patients (clinical severity and inflammatory stage), and this is possibly one of the reasons that explain heterogeneity of results. However, these same trials have shown some evidence that tocilizumab may reduce intensive care unit admissions and/or mechanical ventilation incidence, which are huge challenges in the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 pandemic. Future clinical trials with primary endpoint built on this assumption are needed (1) to confirm whether tocilizumab reduces mechanical ventilation requirement and (2) to describe the right patient population and optimal timing for tocilizumab administration. Finding the optimal timing for tocilizumab administration and the group of patients who are susceptible to having the greatest benefit are probably the main challenge.","Klopfenstein, Timothée; Conrozier, Thierry; Kadiane-Oussou, N’dri Juliette; Gendrin, Vincent; Zayet, Souheil",Open Forum Infect Dis,https://doi.org/10.1093/ofid/ofab013; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33628858/,344

A hospital in Zhuhai adopted several measures in Fever Clinic Management (FCM) to respond to the outbreak of COVID-19. FCM has been proved to be effective in preventing nosocomial cross infection. Faced with the emergency, the hospital undertook creative operational steps in relation to the control and spread of COVID-19, with special focuses on physical and administrative layout of buildings, staff training and preventative procedures. The first operational step was to set up triaging stations at all entrances and then complete a standard and qualified fever clinic, which was isolated from the other buildings within our hospital complex. Secondly, the hospital established its human resource reservation for emergency response and the allocation of human resources to ensure strict and standardised training methods through the hospital for all medical staff and ancillary employees. Thirdly, the hospital divided the fever clinic into partitioned areas and adapted a three-level triaging system. The experiences shared in this paper would be of practical help for the facilities that are encountering or will encounter the challenges of COVID-19, i.e. to prevent nosocomial cross infection among patients and physicians.","Jiang, H.; Liu, J.W.; Ren, N.; He, R.; Li, M.Q.; Dong, Q.C.",Epidemiol Infect,https://doi.org/10.1017/s0950268820001764; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32762783/,344

SOURCE OF DATA: An extensive search of literature was performed in order to identify pediatric cases with extrapulmonary manifestations between January 1, 2020 and June 21, 2020. Generic keywords, such as “Novel coronavirus” or “Novel coronavirus 2019” or “2019 nCoV” or “COVID-19” or “SARS-CoV-2” were searched on PubMed database, associated either with age filters or generic pediatric terms. SUMMARY OF FINDINGS: A total of 28 articles, including 199 patients, were considered suitable to review and data extraction. The main findings were summarized in tables. The main non-pulmonary manifestations in pediatric patients, in decreasing order of frequency, were gastrointestinal, renal, cardiovascular, neurological, hematological and lymphatic, cutaneous, hepatic, ocular, olfactory, and gustatory. Multisystem impairment and Kawasaki-like disease were also described.

From this microscopic approach, we recover the networks of close contacts within consecutive time windows. A longitudinal comparison is then performed by upscaling the traced contacts with the transmission computed from a mean-field compartmental model for the entire city. Our results show that the effective reproduction numbers inside the buses, Rebus, and in the city, Recity, followed a compatible behavior during the first wave of the local outbreak. Moreover, by distinguishing the close contacts of healthcare workers in the buses, we discovered that their transmission, Rehealth, during the same period, was systematically higher than Rebus. This result reinforces the need for special public transportation policies for highly exposed groups of people.","Ponte, C.; Carmona, H.; Oliveira, E.; Caminha, C.; Lima Neto, A.; Andrade, J.; Furtado, V.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.05.31.21257245v1?rss=1; https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.05.31.21257245,344
683112,Incorporating dynamic flight network in SEIR to model mobility between populations,2021-06-10,"BACKGROUND The Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS) protocol has been recently extended to hepatopancreatobiliary (HPB) surgery, with excellent outcomes reported. Early mobilization is an essential facet of the ERAS protocol but compliance has been reported to be poor. We recently reported our success in a 6-month clinical practice improvement program (CPIP) for early postoperative mobilization. During the COVID-19 pandemic, we experienced reduced staffing and resources available which can render sustainability of CPIP difficult. OBJECTIVE We report outcomes at one year following our CPIP to improve the post-operative mobilization in patients undergoing major HPB surgery amidst the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS We divided our study into four phases: (1) phase 1: before CPIP (Jan to Apr 2019); (2) phase 2 (May to Sep 2019): implementation of CPIP; (3) phase 3: post-CPIP before COVID-19 (Oct 2019 to Mar 2020) and (4) phase 4: post-CPIP during COVID-19 (Apr 2020 to Sep 2020). Major HPB surgery was defined as any surgery on the hepato-pancreato-biliary system >2 hours and with anticipated blood loss ≥500ml. Study variables included length of hospitalization stay, distance ambulated on POD2, morbidity, balance measures (incidence of fall and accidental dislodgement of drains), and reasons for failure to achieve targets. Successful mobilization was defined as able to sit out of bed for >6 hours on POD1 and ambulate ≥30m on POD2. Target mobilization rate was ≥75%. RESULTS 114 patients underwent major HPB surgery from phase 2 to phase 4 of our study: 33 (29.0%), 45 (39.5%), and 36 (31.6%) patients in phase 2, phase 3 and phase 4 respectively. No baseline patient demographics was collected for phase 1 (pre-CPIP implementation); Majority of the patients were male (n=79, 69.3%) and underwent hepatic surgery (n=92, 80.7%). There were 76 (66.7%) patients who had ON-Q PainBuster insertion intra-operatively. The median mobilization rate was 22% for phase 1, 78% for phase 2 and 3 combined, and 79% for phase 4. The mean pain score was 2.7±1.0 on POD1 and 1.8±1.5 on POD2. The median length of hospitalization stay was six days (interquartile range (IQR) 5-11.8). There were no falls or accidental dislodgement of drains. Six patients (5.3%) had pneumonia. Twenty-one patients (18.4%) failed to ambulate ≥30m on POD2 from phase 2 to 4. The commonest reason for failure to achieve ambulation target was pain (n=6/21, 28.6%) and lethargy or giddiness (n=5/21, 23.8%). CONCLUSIONS This follow-up study shows the sustainability of our CPIP in improving early postoperative mobilization rates following major HPB surgery one year after implementation, even during the COVID-19 pandemic. Further large-scale multi-institutional prospective studies should be conducted to assess compliance and determine its sustainability.","Chan, Kai Siang; Wang, Bei; Tan, Yen Pin; Chow, Jaclyn Jie Ling; Ong, Ee Ling; Junnarkar, Sameer P; Low, Jee Keem; Huey, Cheong Wei Terence; Shelat, Vishal G",JMIR perioperative medicine,https://doi.org/10.2196/30473; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34559668/,344

The virus invades the target cell by binding to angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) 2 and modulates the expression of ACE2 in host cells. ACE2, a pivotal component of the renin-angiotensin system, exerts its physiological functions by modulating the levels of angiotensin II (Ang II) and Ang-(1-7). We reviewed the literature that reported the distribution and function of ACE2 in the female reproductive system, hoping to clarify the potential harm of 2019-nCoV to female fertility. The available evidence suggests that ACE2 is widely expressed in the ovary, uterus, vagina and placenta. Therefore, we believe that apart from droplets and contact transmission, the possibility of mother-to-child and sexual transmission also exists. Ang II, ACE2 and Ang-(1-7) regulate follicle development and ovulation, modulate luteal angiogenesis and degeneration, and also influence the regular changes in endometrial tissue and embryo development. Taking these functions into account, 2019-nCoV may disturb the female reproductive functions through regulating ACE2.","Jing, Yan; Run-Qian, Li; Hao-Ran, Wang; Hao-Ran, Chen; Ya-Bin, Liu; Yang, Gao; Fei, Chen",Mol Hum Reprod,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32365180/; https://doi.org/10.1093/molehr/gaaa030,344

However, many infected individuals are either asymptomatic or have isolated upper respiratory symptoms, which suggests that the upper airways represent the initial site of viral infection, and that some individuals are able to largely constrain viral pathology to the nasal and oropharyngeal tissues. Which cell types in the human nasopharynx are the primary targets of SARS-CoV-2 infection, and how infection influences the cellular organization of the respiratory epithelium remains incompletely understood. Here, we present nasopharyngeal samples from a cohort of 35 individuals with COVID-19, representing a wide spectrum of disease states from ambulatory to critically ill, as well as 23 healthy and intubated patients without COVID-19. Using standard nasopharyngeal swabs, we collected viable cells and performed single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq), simultaneously profiling both host and viral RNA. We find that following infection with SARS-CoV-2, the upper respiratory epithelium undergoes massive reorganization: secretory cells diversify and expand, and mature epithelial cells are preferentially lost. Further, we observe evidence for deuterosomal cell and immature ciliated cell expansion, potentially representing active repopulation of lost ciliated cells through coupled secretory cell differentiation. Epithelial cells from participants with mild/moderate COVID-19 show extensive induction of genes associated with anti-viral and type I interferon responses. In contrast, cells from participants with severe lower respiratory symptoms appear globally muted in their anti-viral capacity, despite substantially higher local inflammatory myeloid populations and equivalent nasal viral loads. This suggests an essential role for intrinsic, local epithelial immunity in curbing and constraining viral-induced pathology. Using a custom computational pipeline, we characterized cell-associated SARS-CoV-2 RNA and identified rare cells with RNA intermediates strongly suggestive of active replication. Both within and across individuals, we find remarkable diversity and heterogeneity among SARS-CoV-2 RNA+ host cells, including developing/immature and interferon-responsive ciliated cells, KRT13+ “hillock”-like cells, and unique subsets of secretory, goblet, and squamous cells. Finally, SARS-CoV-2 RNA+ cells, as compared to uninfected bystanders, are enriched for genes involved in susceptibility (e.g., CTSL, TMPRSS2) or response (e.g., MX1, IFITM3, EIF2AK2) to infection. Together, this work defines both protective and detrimental host responses to SARS-CoV-2, determines the direct viral targets of infection, and suggests that failed anti-viral epithelial immunity in the nasal mucosa may underlie the progression to severe COVID-19.","Ziegler, Carly G.

This study aimed to determine baseline vitamin D serum concentrations and the effects of its supplementation in asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic Coronavirus Disease 2019 outpatients. Methods: 42 outpatients were included, 22 of which received a supplement of 10,000 IU of vitamin D3 for 14 days; the remaining 20 outpatients were designated as a control group. Serum levels of transferrin, ferritin, vitamin D, and D-dimer were measured at baseline in both groups. After 14 days, serum levels of total vitamin D were determined in the supplemented group. Results: At baseline, only 19% of infected outpatients had vitamin D levels corresponding to sufficiency. All outpatients with vitamin D insufficiency had at least one symptom associated with the disease, while only 75% of patients with symptoms presented sufficiency. On the seventh and fourteenth day of follow-up, the supplemented group presented fewer symptoms with respect to those non-supplemented. A vitamin D3 dose of 10,000 IU/daily for 14 days was sufficient to raise vitamin D serum concentrations. Conclusions: Immunomodulatory effects of vitamin D appear to be linked to the development of symptoms in positive outpatients.

687268,Cybercrime in a time of coronavirus,2020-05-31,"The COVID-19 pandemic has had pronounced effects on individuals' psychological well-being around the world. Concerns regarding the consequences of infection, as well as the general uncertainty and governmental regulations have resulted in increased psychological distress among many populations and cultures. In this regard, research has shown that the manner by which individuals perceive such large-scale threats and appraise them significantly contributes to the psychological consequences of such events. According to the Hostile-World Scenario (HWS) model, negative engagement (NE) with such threats weakens one's competence and coping abilities, whereas positive engagement (PE) facilitates resilience and enhances psychological adjustment. Accordingly, the current study examines the moderating role of both NE and PE in the connections of two main features of the current pandemic, COVID-19-related worries and loneliness, with anxiety. Data were collected between March 16 and April 14, 2020, from 1,112 Israelis (age range 17–92, M = 46.90, SD = 16.46), who provided information regarding COVID-19 health worries, loneliness, and anxiety. A special measure assembled items pertinent to the HWS-NE and HWS-PE throughout the survey. Results demonstrated that both HWS-NE and HWS-PE were significant moderators. COVID-19-related health worries/loneliness were linked with anxiety only among individuals with high HWS-NE, and were non-significant among those with low HWS-NE. Moreover, the positive association between loneliness and anxiety was significantly mitigated by high HWS-PE. The discussion highlights the importance of the HWS for understanding the psychological consequences of COVID-19 and offers practical suggestions, which may aid mental health practitioners in providing assistance and support to the general population.","Bergman, Yoav S.; Shrira, Amit; Palgi, Yuval; Shmotkin, Dov",Front Psychol,https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.645655; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33796056/,344

However, available data cannot clearly characterize the correlation between cardiac injury and COVID-19. Thus, we conducted a meta-analysis of recent studies to 1) explore the prevalence of cardiac injury in different types of COVID-19 patients and 2) evaluate the association between cardiac injury and worse prognosis (severe disease, admission to ICU, and mortality) in patients with COVID-19. Methods and results Literature searched was conducted through PubMed, the Cochrane Library, Embase, and MedRxiv databases. Meta-analysis was performed with Stata 14.0. Fixed-effects model was used if the I 2 values ≤50%, otherwise the random-effects model was performed.Prevalence of cardiac injury was 19% (95%CI:0.15-0.22, p<0.001) in total COVID-19 patients, 36% (95%CI:0.25-0.47, p<0.001) in severe COVID-19 patients, and 48% (95%CI:0.30-0.66, p<0.001) in non-survivors. Furthermore, cardiac injury was found to be associated with a significant increase in risk of poor outcomes with pooled effect size(ES) of 8.46(95%CI:3.76-19.06, p=0.062), severe disease with ES of 3.54(95% CI:2.25-5.58, p<0.001), admission to ICU with ES of 5.03(95% CI:2.69-9.39,p<0.001), and mortality with ES of 4.99(95% CI:3.38-7.37, p<0.001).

We reviewed the progress made towards meeting the air quality standards established by the EU Ambient Air Quality Directives (European Council Directive 2008/50/EC) and the World Health Organization (WHO) Air Quality Guidelines by estimating the trends (Mann-Kendal test) in national emissions of main air pollutants, urban population exposure to air pollution, and in mortality related to exposure to ambient fine particles (PM(2.5)) and tropospheric ozone (O(3)). RESULTS: Despite significant reductions of emissions (e.g., sulfur oxides: ~ 80%, nitrogen oxides: ~ 46%, non-methane volatile organic compounds: ~ 44%, particulate matters with a diameter lower than 2.5 µm and 10 µm: ~ 30%), the EU-28 urban population was exposed to PM(2.5) and O(3) levels widely exceeding the WHO limit values for the protection of human health. Between 2000 and 2017, the annual PM(2.5)-related number of deaths decreased (- 4.85 per 10(6) inhabitants) in line with a reduction of PM(2.5) levels observed at urban air quality monitoring stations. The rising O(3) levels became a major public health issue in the EU-28 cities where the annual O(3)-related number of premature deaths increased (+ 0.55 deaths per 10(6) inhabitants). CONCLUSIONS: To achieve the objectives of the Ambient Air Quality Directives and mitigate air pollution impacts, actions need to be urgently taken at all governance levels. In this context, greening and re‐naturing cities and the implementation of fresh air corridors can help meet air quality standards, but also answer to social needs, as recently highlighted by the COVID-19 lockdowns.","Sicard, Pierre; Agathokleous, Evgenios; De Marco, Alessandra; Paoletti, Elena; Calatayud, Vicent",Environ Sci Eur,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33717794/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12302-020-00450-2,344

Using creative and arts-based methods, co-researchers remotely co-analysed the survey results amid Covid-19 lockdown challenges. Here, we explore our unexpected ‘transition’ journey from the physical ‘Hub’ to the digital space. METHODS: We organised 20 sessions at ‘The Hub’ and used audio/video/photo recordings to ‘capture’ key moments. With the lockdown, we ensured that every co-researcher had access to and support for digital technologies. Throughout 2020, we organized 28 Zoom meetings involving all co-researchers. In June, Lilly() and Sue() conducted Zoom interviews with the co-research team to reflect on our ‘transition’ journey. In this creative video-form submission accompanied by an accessible report, Lilly puts together a story of how we transitioned and felt throughout this process. FINDINGS: We identify that trust and the social bonds established at ‘The Hub’ are the key components of our transition to the digital environment. There is the tension between longing for in-person contact and trying to make the most out of the situation to maintain these relationships. At the heart of this is the motivation to ‘change the world’ and the strive for social justice. Having time and opportunity to improve, and co-researchers’ steady growth in confidence, are equally important. CONCLUSIONS: The determination for maintaining friendships among co-researchers and the motivation to ‘change the world’ overcome Covid-19 related challenges in continuing co-research.

689120,The effect of heterogeneity on hypergraph contagion models,2020-10-11,"Mental health is as crucial as physical health, but it is underappreciated by mainstream biomedical research and the public. Compared to the use of AI or robots in physical healthcare, the use of AI or robots in mental healthcare is much more limited in number and scope. To date, psychological resilience—the ability to cope with a crisis and quickly return to the pre-crisis state—has been identified as an important predictor of psychological well-being but has not been commonly considered by AI systems (e.g., smart wearable devices) or social robots to personalize services such as emotion coaching. To address the dearth of investigations, the present study explores the possibility of estimating personal resilience using physiological and speech signals measured during human–robot conversations. Specifically, the physiological and speech signals of 32 research participants were recorded while the participants answered a humanoid social robot’s questions about their positive and negative memories about three periods of their lives. The results from machine learning models showed that heart rate variability and paralinguistic features were the overall best predictors of personal resilience. Such predictability of personal resilience can be leveraged by AI and social robots to improve user understanding and has great potential for various mental healthcare applications in the future.","Hsu, Shin-Min; Chen, Sue-Huei; Huang, Tsung-Ren",Sensors (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34502736/; https://doi.org/10.3390/s21175844,344
689495,Special Issue “New Studies of Conjugated Compounds”,2020-07-15,"During the last years, there has been a dramatic increase in the administrative and bureaucratic burden associated with clinical research, which has clearly had an impact on its overall efficiency and on the activity of clinical investigators and research teams. Indeed, the supervision of the adherence of clinical research to Good Clinical Practice (GCP) guidelines and legal regulations is of the utmost importance. Yet, while such regulations have remained largely unchanged during recent years, the number of administrative tasks and their complexity have grown markedly, as supported by the results of a survey performed among 940 clinical investigators that we report in this manuscript. Therefore, many investigators believe that it has become necessary to undertake a rigorous analysis of the causes and consequences of this issue, and to create a conduit to channel the advice from experienced investigators regarding clinical research procedures, in order to improve them. Based on these premises, ESMO has launched the ESMO Clinical Research Observatory (ECRO), a task force that will analyse different aspects of clinical research. ECRO will aim to provide the views of ESMO on clinical research procedures based on the feedback from clinical investigators, under complete adherence to the Declaration of Helsinki, the GCP guidelines and any other applicable legal regulations, while at the same time showing profound respect for all the stakeholders involved in clinical research. This manuscript provides the background and rationale for the creation of ECRO, its planned activity and an analysis of the current administrative burden in clinical research with recommendations to rationalise it. Indeed, we expect that this effort shall lead to a relevant improvement in the care of patients and in the development of clinical research.","Perez-Gracia, Jose Luis; Awada, Ahmad; Calvo, Emiliano; Amaral, Teresa; Arkenau, Hendrik-Tobias; Gruenwald, Viktor; Bodoky, Gyorgy; Lolkema, Martijn P; Di Nicola, Massimo; Penel, Nicolas; Vera, Ruth; Sanmamed, Miguel F; Douillard, Jean-Yves",ESMO Open,https://doi.org/10.1136/esmoopen-2019-000662; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32393574/,344
690368,Sex- and gender-based analysis of coronavirus crisis competence,2020-09-30,"To investigate prevalence of ongoing activation of inflammation following asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection we characterized immune cell transcriptomes from 43 asymptomatic seropositive and 52 highly exposed seronegative individuals with few underlying health issues following a community superspreading event. Four mildly symptomatic seropositive individuals examined three weeks after infection as positive controls demonstrated immunological activation. Approximately four to six weeks following the event, the two asymptomatic groups showed no significant differences. Two seropositive patients with underlying genetic disease impacting immunological activation were included (Cystic Fibrosis (CF), Nuclear factor-kappa B Essential Modulator (NEMO) deficiency). CF, but not NEMO, associated with significant immune transcriptome differences including some associated with severe SARS-CoV-2 infection (IL1B, IL17A, respective receptors). All subjects remained in their usual state of health from event through five-month follow-up. Here, asymptomatic infection resolved without evidence of prolonged immunological activation. Inclusion of subjects with underlying genetic disease illustrated the pathophysiological importance of context on impact of immunological response.","Lee, Hye Kyung; Knabl, Ludwig; Pipperger, Lisa; Volland, Andre; Furth, Priscilla A.; Kang, Keunsoo; Smith, Harold E.; Knabl, Ludwig; Bellmann, Romuald; Bernhard, Christina; Kaiser, Norbert; Gänzer, Hannes; Ströhle, Mathias; Walser, Andreas; von Laer, Dorothee; Hennighausen, Lothar",medRxiv,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.01.20185884v1?rss=1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32908998/; https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.09.01.20185884,344
