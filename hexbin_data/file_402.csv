3815,"Cohort profile: Studies of Work Environment and Disease Epidemiology-Infections (SWEDE-I), a prospective cohort on employed adults in Sweden",2019-05-15,"The aim of this article is to provide a detailed description of the SWEDE-I cohort, a prospective study designed to investigate work-related risk factors for transmission of viral infections. A total of 2,237 subjects aged 25–64, working and residing in Eskilstuna (central Sweden), enrolled in the study in August 2011. They filled in five detailed questionnaires including information on demography, personal characteristics, work tasks, work place, contact patterns, family structure, health status, physical activity and diet. During a 9-month follow-up period, the participants self-reported—via internet or telephone—any onset of fever, upper respiratory tract infection, or gastroenteritis immediately as they occurred. For each disease episode, the participants were asked to submit a self-sampled nasal swab for viral diagnosis. In total, 1,733 disease reports were recorded and 1,843 nasal swabs were received, of which 48% tested positive for one or more of 14 analyzed viruses. The cohort has been used to date to study diet, sleep and physical activity as determinants for upper respiratory tract infections. Analyses of contact patterns and occupational circumstances as risk factors for the transmission of infections are ongoing. The SWEDE-I study should be seen as a first pioneering effort to provide new insight in the epidemiology and prevention of viral infections. Potential joint collaborations can be discussed with the principal investigators.","Ghilotti, Francesca; Julander, Anneli; Gustavsson, Per; Linde, Annika; Nyrén, Olof; Plymoth, Amelie",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6519895/,402
4443,Intraoperative ventilation strategies for obese patients undergoing bariatric surgery: systematic review and meta-analysis,2020-02-04,"BACKGROUND: Obesity is a global epidemic, and it is widely known that increased Body mass index (BMI) is associated with alterations in respiratory mechanics. Bariatric surgery is established as an effective treatment for this condition. OBJECTIVE: To assess the safety and effectiveness of different ventilation strategies in obese patients undergoing bariatric surgery. METHODS: A systematic review of randomized clinical trials aimed at evaluating ventilation strategies for obese patients was carried out. Primary outcomes: in-hospital mortality, adequacy of gas exchange, and respiration mechanics alterations. RESULTS: Fourteen clinical trials with 574 participants were included. When recruitment maneuvers (RM) vs Positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) were compared, RM resulted in better oxygenation p = 0.03 (MD 79.93), higher plateau pressure p < 0.00001 (MD 7.30), higher mean airway pressure p < 0.00001 (MD 6.61), and higher compliance p < 0.00001 (MD 21.00); when comparing RM + Zero end-expiratory pressure (ZEEP) vs RM + PEEP 5 or 10 cmH2O, RM associated with PEEP led to better oxygenation p = 0.001 (MD 167.00); when comparing Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) 40 cmH2O + PEEP 10 cmH2O vs CPAP 40 cmH2O + PEEP 15 cmH2O, CPAP 40 + PEEP 15 achieved better gas exchange p = 0.003 (MD 36.00) and compliance p = 0.0003 (MD 3.00). CONCLUSION: There is some evidence that the alveolar recruitment maneuvers associated with PEEP lead to better oxygenation and higher compliance. There is no evidence of differences between pressure control ventilation (PCV) and Volume control ventilation (VCV).","Costa Souza, George Márcio; Santos, Gianni Mara; Zimpel, Sandra Adriana; Melnik, Tamara",BMC Anesthesiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7001296/,402
6941,Executive Dysfunction Following Critical Illness: Exploring Risk Factors and Management Options in Geriatric Populations,2016-03-31,"Previous studies have demonstrated paralemmin-3 (PALM3) participates in Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling. This study investigated the effect of PALM3 knockdown on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced acute lung injury (ALI) and its underlying mechanisms. We constructed a recombinant adenoviral vector containing short hairpin RNA for PALM3 to knockdown PALM3 expression. A transgene-free adenoviral vector was used as a negative control. The ALI rat model was established by LPS peritoneal injection at 48-h post-transfection. Results showed that downregulation of PALM3 improved the survival rate, attenuated lung pathological changes, alleviated pulmonary edema, lung vascular leakage and neutrophil infiltration, inhibited the production of proinflammatory cytokines and activation of nuclear factor κB and interferon β regulatory factor 3, and promoted the secretion of anti-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-10 and expression of suppressor of cytokine signaling-3 in the ALI rat model. However, PALM3 knockdown had no effect on TLR4, myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88), and Toll-interleukin-1 receptor domain-containing adaptor inducing interferon β (TRIF) expression. Moreover, PALM3 knockdown reduced the interaction of TLR4 with MyD88 or TRIF induced by LPS in rat lungs. Therefore, the downregulation of PALM3 protected rats from LPS-induced ALI and its mechanisms were partially associated with the modulation of inflammatory responses and inhibition of TLR4/MyD88 and TLR4/TRIF complex formation.","Chen, Xuxin; Tang, Lu; Feng, Jian; Wang, Yi; Han, Zhihai; Meng, Jiguang",Inflammation,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7102376/,402

ABSTRACT: Promoting flowering and flower longevity as well as creating novelty in flower structure, colour range and fragrances are major objectives of ornamental plant breeding. The novel genome editing techniques add new possibilities to study gene function and breed new varieties. The implementation of such techniques, however, relies on detailed information about structure and function of genomes and genes. Moreover, improved protocols for efficient delivery of editing reagents are required. Recent results of the application of genome editing techniques to elite ornamental crops are discussed in this review. Enabling technologies and genomic resources are reviewed in relation to the implementation of such approaches. Availability of the main gene sequences, underlying commercial traits and in vitro transformation protocols are provided for the world’s best-selling cut flowers, namely rose, lily, chrysanthemum, lisianthus, tulip, gerbera, freesia, alstroemeria, carnation and hydrangea. Results obtained so far are described and their implications for the improvement of flowering, flower architecture, colour, scent and shelf-life are discussed.

16137,Why Do They Fall? The Impact of Insomnia on Gait of Older Adults: A Case–Control Study,2021-03-09,"Earlier, after our bioinformatic analysis of single-nucleotide polymorphisms of TATA-binding protein-binding sites within gene promoters on the human Y chromosome, we suggested that human reproductive potential diminishes during self-domestication. Here, we implemented bioinformatics models of human diseases using animal in vivo genome-wide RNA-Seq data to compare the effect of co-directed changes in the expression of orthologous genes on human reproductive potential and during the divergence of domestic and wild animals from their nearest common ancestor (NCA). For example, serotonin receptor 3A (HTR3A) deficiency contributes to sudden death in pregnancy, consistently with Htr3a underexpression in guinea pigs (Cavia porcellus) during their divergence from their NCA with cavy (C. aperea). Overall, 25 and three differentially expressed genes (hereinafter, DEGs) in domestic animals versus 11 and 17 DEGs in wild animals show the direction consistent with human orthologous gene-markers of reduced and increased reproductive potential. This indicates a reliable association between DEGs in domestic animals and human orthologous genes reducing reproductive potential (Pearson’s χ(2) test p < 0.001, Fisher’s exact test p < 0.05, binomial distribution p < 0.0001), whereas DEGs in wild animals uniformly match human orthologous genes decreasing and increasing human reproductive potential (p > 0.1; binomial distribution), thus enforcing the norm (wild type).","Vasiliev, Gennady; Chadaeva, Irina; Rasskazov, Dmitry; Ponomarenko, Petr; Sharypova, Ekaterina; Drachkova, Irina; Bogomolov, Anton; Savinkova, Ludmila; Ponomarenko, Mikhail; Kolchanov, Nikolay; Osadchuk, Alexander; Oshchepkov, Dmitry; Osadchuk, Ludmila",Int J Mol Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7956675/,402

Here, we reported a double-headed SeV nucleocapsid assembled in a tail-to-tail manner, and resolved its helical stems and clam-shaped joint at the respective resolutions of 2.9 and 3.9 Å, via cryo-electron microscopy. Our structures offer important insights into the mechanism of the helical polymerization, in particular via an unnoticed exchange of a N-terminal hole formed by three loops of nucleoproteins, and unveil the clam-shaped joint in a hyper-closed state for nucleocapsid dimerization. Direct visualization of the loop from the disordered C-terminal tail provides structural evidence that C-terminal tail is correlated to the curvature of nucleocapsid and links nucleocapsid condensation and genome replication and transcription with different assembly forms.","Zhang, Na; Shan, Hong; Liu, Mingdong; Li, Tianhao; Luo, Rui; Yang, Liuyan; Qi, Lei; Chu, Xiaofeng; Su, Xin; Wang, Rui; Liu, Yunhui; Sun, Wenzhi; Shen, Qing-Tao",Commun Biol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8062630/,402
17862,Transfusion Strategies for Pediatric Cardiac Surgery: A Meta-Analysis and Trial Sequential Analysis,2021-05-28,"The provision of sanitation services for fast-growing urban populations is one of the world's urgent challenges. Hutong neighborhoods in Beijing, capital of China, cannot be rebuilt due to the protection of historical heritage, while residents still need to keep the habit of defecating in public toilets. One hundred public toilets with non-sewered sanitation in the Hutong neighborhoods of Beijing were visited to investigate the actual operating status in response to the “toilet revolution” campaign. The fault tree approach was used to identify the barriers toward a decent and environment-friendly public toilet and evaluate potential risks from the malfunction of various components. Four subsystems are defined and elaborated to calculate the fault possibility. These subsystems are environment- and user-friendly, regarded as ancillary facilities, and used for fecal sludge (FS) management. Statistical analysis of targeted cases indicated that fault probabilities of environmental considerations, user-friendly considerations, ancillary facilities, FS management are calculated as 0.79, 0.96, 0.96, and 0, respectively. The subsystems were weighted using a Delphi method concept. Results showed that the well operation ratio of Beijing Hutong public toilets is only 32%, and the sanitation service value chain can be further optimized. This study also provides references for other countries, which are dedicated to promoting urban sanitation and public health.","Yan, Rui; Cheng, Shikun; Chen, Jingang; Li, Xiangkai; Sharma, Sumit; Nazim Uddin, Sayed Mohammad; Mang, Heinz-Peter; Chen, Cong; Li, Zifu; Li, Tianxin; Wang, Xuemei",J Environ Manage,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8075803/,402

Although RRT is frequently used in intensive care units in Germany, it is currently unknown which RRT procedures are available, which qualification the involved staff has, which anticoagulation strategies are used and how RRT doses are prescribed. To investigate quality and structural characteristics of the performance of RRT in intensive care units throughout Germany, the German Interdisciplinary Society of Intensivists (Deutsche Interdisziplinäre Vereinigung für Intensiv- und Notfallmedizin [DIVI]) performed an inquiry among their members. A total of 897 members participated in the survey in which practical aspects were queried. In 69.1% of the cases, RRT was performed in hospitals with more than 400 beds and in 74.5% in university hospitals or other primary care hospitals. Furthermore, 93.3% of clinics are equipped with continuous and 75.8% with intermittent renal replacement devices. In 91.9%, indication for initiation of RRT was performed by trained physicians specialized in intensive care medicine or nephrologists. Intermittent as well as continuous modalities are both present in three-quarters of cases, which allows for individualized therapy. However, the documentation of dialysis dose needs to be improved.","Willam, Carsten; Meersch, Melanie; Herbst, Larissa; Heering, Peter; Schmitz, Michael; Oppert, Michael; John, Stefan; Jörres, Achim; Zarbock, Alexander; Janssens, Uwe; Kindgen-Milles, Detlef",Med Klin Intensivmed Notfmed,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8243065/,402
19239,C7 Fracture as a Complication of C7 Dome-Like Laminectomy : Impact on Clinical and Radiological Outcomes and Evaluation of the Risk Factors,2021-06-29,"A major shortcoming of postischemic therapy for myocardial infarction is the no-reflow phenomenon due to impaired cardiac microvascular function including microcirculatory barrier function, loss of endothelial activity, local inflammatory cell accumulation, and increased oxidative stress. Consequently, inadequate reperfusion of the microcirculation causes secondary ischemia, aggravating the myocardial reperfusion injury. ATP-sensitive potassium ion (K(ATP)) channels regulate the coronary blood flow and protect cardiomyocytes from ischemia-reperfusion injury. Studies in animal models of myocardial ischemia-reperfusion have illustrated that the opening of mitochondrial KATP (mito-K(ATP)) channels alleviates endothelial dysfunction and reduces myocardial necrosis. By contrast, blocking mito-K(ATP) channels aggravates microvascular necrosis and no-reflow phenomenon following ischemia-reperfusion injury. Nicorandil, as an antianginal drug, has been used for ischemic preconditioning (IPC) due to its mito-K(ATP) channel-opening effect, thereby limiting infarct size and subsequent severe ischemic insult. In this review, we analyze the protective actions of nicorandil against microcirculation reperfusion injury with a focus on improving mitochondrial integrity. In addition, we discuss the function of mitochondria in the pathogenesis of myocardial ischemia.","Jiang, Xiaosi; Wu, Dan; Jiang, Zichao; Ling, Weiwei; Qian, Geng",Oxid Med Cell Longev,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8275446/,402

A prospective observational study with repeated indirect calorimetry measurements,2021-08-30,"Acute lung injury (ALI) is a type of serious clinical syndrome leading to morbidity and mortality. However, the precise pathogenesis of ALI remains elusive. Here, we implemented an integrative meta-analysis of six GEO microarray studies with 76 samples in the ALI mouse model. A total of 958 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified in LPS relative to normal samples. Then, a network-based meta-analysis was used to mine core DEGs and to unfold the interactions among these genes. We found that Ebi3 was the top upregulated genes in the LPS-induced ALI. GO, KEGG, and GSEA analyses were performed for functional annotation. qRT-PCR revealed augmented expression of six candidate genes (Stat1, Syk, Jak3, Rac2, Ripk1, and Traf6) in the established ALI mouse model with LPS exposure.

Relief of breathlessness in a sitting or standing position compared to the recumbent position is referred to as orthopnoea. While increased venous return in the supine patient is well tolerated in individuals with a preserved heart function, this leads to pulmonary venous congestion, an increase in interstitial lung water and a subsequent reduction of lung capacities with resultant shortness of breath in patients with impaired heart function. Accordingly, patients with heart failure prefer to sit upright (e.g. supporting their back with pillows to achieve a maximum upright position) (Fig. 5.1). Conversely, placing the patient into a supine position may be used as a stress test to exclude respiratory distress due to heart failure or (pulmonary) fluid overload. A history of paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnoea characterized by repeated awakening due to breathlessness while sleeping in the recumbent position is a typical symptom of heart failure.","Dünser, Martin W.; Dankl, Daniel; Petros, Sirak; Mer, Mervyn",Clinical Examination Skills in the Adult Critically Ill Patient,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7122865/,402

Deep water collections have been made by dredging and trawling. These are both cost-effective collection methods if the substratum does not cause damage to or snag the gear. There are several disadvantages to these approaches. It is difficult to photograph the organisms in their habitat, and encrusting organisms or organisms that grow in crevices, under ledges, or on steep rock faces cannot be easily collected unless the hard substrate that supports the organism is collected as well; dredging and trawling put all collected samples in close contact with each other and therefore, some organisms may chemically contaminate others because of exudations or secretions of various compounds and the environmental impact of dredging or trawling can be detrimental because the sampling is nonselective and habitats can be damaged or destroyed. A controversial facet of marine-derived microorganisms is their putative role with respect to the origin of bioactive natural products from marine macroorganism–microorganisms associations.

When a system is described by graph-transformation rules, it is often desirable that the rules are both terminating and confluent so that rule applications in an arbitrary order produce unique resulting graphs. However, there are application scenarios where the rules are not globally confluent but confluent on a subclass of graphs that are of interest. In other words, non-resolvable conflicts can only occur on graphs that are considered as “garbage”. In this paper, we introduce the notion of confluence up to garbage and generalise Plump’s critical pair lemma for double-pushout graph transformation, providing a sufficient condition for confluence up to garbage by non-garbage critical pair analysis. We apply our results to language recognition by backtracking-free graph reduction, showing how to establish that a graph language can be decided by a system which is confluent up to garbage. We present two case studies with backtracking-free graph reduction systems which recognise a class of flow diagrams and a class of labelled series-parallel graphs, respectively.

Our study explored risk factors for death from severe pertussis. METHOD: A case-control study of infants with severe pertussis admitted to the paediatric intensive care unit (PICU) in the Children’s Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, China, from January 1, 2013, to June 30, 2019, was conducted. Pertussis was confirmed by clinical features and laboratory examinations. Severe pertussis was defined as patients with pertussis resulting in PICU admission or death. To understand the risk factors for death, we compared fatal and nonfatal cases of severe pertussis in infants aged < 120 days by collecting clinical and laboratory data. RESULTS: The participants included 63 infants < 120 days of age with severe pertussis. Fifteen fatal cases were confirmed and compared with 44 nonfatal severe pertussis cases, Four patients with termination of treatment were excluded. In the univariate analysis, the risk factors associated with death included apnoea (P = 0.001), leukocytosis (white blood cell (WBC) count≥30 × 10(9)/L (P = 0.001) or ≥ 50 × 10(9)/L (P = 0)), highest lymphocyte count (P = 0), pulmonary hypertension (P = 0.001), and length of PICU stay (P = 0.003). The multivariate analysis revealed that apnoea (OR 23.722, 95%CI 2.796–201.26, P = 0.004), leukocytosis (OR 63.708, 95%CI 3.574–1135.674, P = 0.005) and pulmonary hypertension (OR 26.109, 95%CI 1.800–378.809, P = 0.017) were significantly associated with death. CONCLUSION: Leukocytosis and pulmonary hypertension exhibited the greatest associations with death in infants with severe pertussis admitted to the PICU. Vaccination is still the most effective protection method against pertussis.","Liu, Cong; Yang, Lin; Cheng, Yuwei; Xu, Hongmei; Xu, Feng",BMC Infect Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7668018/,402

Its aim is to identify the position of Marx’s theory of capital in the history of economics. Thus, this article discusses Marx’s critical reception of his predecessors and the investigation after him. In this respect, Hicks’ distinction of capital theoreticians between “fundists” and “materialists” is useful. Marx’s view of capital shows several fundist characteristics in line with the classical economists preceding him. However, viewed from the materialistic perspective of capital theory, he had successors in the Russian planners of socialist centralized economy in the twentieth century. The peculiarity of Marx’s capital theory lies in its critical dimension, which supersedes the positivistic theorizing of ordinary economists. Marx would recognize the relationship of production that emerges out of the antagonistic split between subjective and objective elements (“primitive accumulation”). Thus, we must now ask if two centuries of mankind’s history has discovered a solution or made any progress in this respect.","Yagi, Kiichiro",Evolut Inst Econ Rev,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7801156/,402

In the present proof of concept, the effectiveness of rapid microorganism identification with a targeted bottom-up proteomics approach was investigated in endotracheal aspirate (ETA) samples of VAP patients. To do so, a prototype selected-reaction monitoring (SRM)-based assay was developed on a triple quadrupole mass spectrometer tracking proteotypic peptide surrogates of bacterial proteomes. Through the concurrent monitoring of 97 species-specific peptides, this preliminary assay was dimensioned to characterize the occurrence of six most frequent bacterial species responsible for over more than 65% of VAP. Assay performance was subsequently evaluated by analyzing early and regular 37 ETA samples collected from 15 patients. Twenty-five samples were above the significant threshold of 10(5) CFU/mL and five samples showed mixed infections (both pathogens ≥ 10(5) CFU/mL). The targeted proteomics assay showed 100% specificity for Acinetobacter baumannii, Escherichia coli, Haemophilus influenzae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, and Streptococcus pneumoniae. No false bacterial identification was reported and no interference was detected arising from the commensal flora. The overall species identification sensitivity was 19/25 (76%) and was higher at the patient level (84.6%). This successful proof of concept provides a rational to broaden the panel of bacteria for further clinical evaluation.

In this article, we explore how the growing focus on socio-economic impact as the assessment criterion of research funding shapes the discipline of political science itself—its knowledge production, dissemination and the emergent forms of accountability of political scientists. The article presents the results of a major international study that has examined the emergence of ‘impact agendas’ across 33 countries. We report on the changing idea of relevance of political science through the lens of its strategic ambiguity and historical evolution. We then explore these broader trends through an in-depth analysis of the UK as an ‘extreme case’ and a blueprint for funding system reforms. These developments, we argue, are not a mere funding policy innovation but rather a paradigm-level change, reshaping the position of political science in society as well as the types of scholarship that are possible and incentivised.

Although these products are being adopted by various industries and stakeholders, their incorporation in clinical trials has been slow due to a disconnect between the promises of digital products and potential risks in using these new technologies in the absence of regulatory support. The Foundation for the National Institutes of Health (FNIH) Biomarkers Consortium hosted a public workshop to address challenges and opportunities in this field. Important characteristics of tool development were addressed in a series of presentations, case studies, and open panel sessions. The workshop participants endorsed the usefulness of an evidentiary criteria framework, highlighted the importance of early patient engagement, and emphasized the potential impact of digital monitoring tools and precompetitive collaborations. Concerns were expressed about the lack of real‐life validation examples and the limitations of legacy standards used as a benchmark for novel tool development and validation. Participants recognized the need for novel analytical and statistical approaches to accommodate analyses of these novel data types. Future directions are to harmonize definitions to build common methodologies and foster multidisciplinary collaborations; to develop approaches toward integrating digital monitoring data with the totality of the data in clinical trials, and to continue an open dialog in the community. There was a consensus that all these efforts combined may create a paradigm shift of how clinical trials are planned, conducted, and results brought to regulatory reviews.","Izmailova, Elena S.; Wagner, John A.; Ammour, Nadir; Amondikar, Ninad; Bell‐Vlasov, Andrea; Berman, Steven; Bloomfield, Dan; Brady, Linda S.; Cai, Xuemei; Calle, Roberto A.; Campbell, Michelle; Cerreta, Francesca; Clay, Ieuan; Foschini, Luca; Furlong, Pat; Goldel, Rob; Goldsack, Jennifer S.; Groenen, Peter M.A.; Folarin, Amos; Heemskerk, Jill; Honig, Peter; Hotopf, Matthew; Kamphaus, Tania; Karlin, Daniel R.; Leptak, Christopher; Liu, Qi; Manji, Husseini; Mather, Robert J.; Menetski, Joseph P.; Narayan, Vaibhav A.; Papadopoulos, Elektra; Patel, Bakul; Patrick‐Lake, Bray; Podichetty, Jagdeep T.; Pratap, Abhishek; Servais, Laurent; Stephenson, Diane; Tenaerts, Pam; Tromberg, Bruce J.; Usdin, Steve; Vasudevan, Srikanth; Zipunnikov, Vadim; Hoffmann, Steven C.",Clin Transl Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7877824/,402

Since reachability is already known to be undecidable in the fragment of PS 2.0 with only release-acquire accesses (PS 2.0-ra), we consider the fragment with only relaxed accesses and promises (PS 2.0-rlx). We show that reachability under PS 2.0-rlx is undecidable in general and that it becomes decidable, albeit non-primitive recursive, if we bound the number of promises. Given these results, we consider a bounded version of the reachability problem. To this end, we bound both the number of promises and of “view-switches”, i.e., the number of times the processes may switch their local views of the global memory. We provide a code-to-code translation from an input program under PS 2.0 (with relaxed and release-acquire memory accesses along with promises) to a program under SC, thereby reducing the bounded reachability problem under PS 2.0 to the bounded context-switching problem under SC. We have implemented a tool and tested it on a set of benchmarks, demonstrating that typical bugs in programs can be found with a small bound.","Abdulla, Parosh Aziz; Atig, Mohamed Faouzi; Godbole, Adwait; Krishna, S.; Vafeiadis, Viktor",Programming Languages and Systems,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7984576/,402

Frailty has been proposed for risk stratification in COVID-19 with limited evidence. Cardiovascular risk factors hypertension, diabetes and raised BMI have been associated with increased COVID-19 risk. We sought to test if non-frail older adults with low cardiovascular risk had reduced COVID-19, to inform targeted shielding policies. METHODS: Fried and Rockwood frailty were ascertained at UK Biobank baseline (2006-2010) and electronic frailty index(eFI) in primary care data to 2017*. A cardiovascular disease risk score(CRS) consisting of smoking status, LDL-cholesterol, blood pressure, BMI, fasting glucose and physical activity was estimated at baseline. Frailty (baseline and eFI; eFI alone) and CRS were tested in logistic models against COVID-19 status and COVID-19 mortality to 14th June 2020 adjusted for demographics and technical covariates. RESULTS: N=269,164 UKB participants aged ≥65 at baseline (≥75years in 2020). 13.9% of COVID-19 positive were non-frail with low baseline CRS versus 41.8% frail with moderate/high CRS. Being non-frail and having low CRS were independently associated with reduced COVID-19. The composite of non-frail with low CRS compared to frail with moderate/high CRS had significantly reduced COVID-19 risk (composite non-frail with low CRS HR 0.61; 95% CI 0.45-0.84; p=0.0023; eFI non-frail with low CRS HR 0.16; 95%CI 0.07-0.36; p value=9.9x10-6) and COVID-19 mortality (composite non-frail HR 0.28; 95% CI 0.10-0.82; pvalue=0.02; eFI non-frail 0.07; 95% CI 0.02-0.28; pvalue=0.00014). CONCLUSION: These results show that the COVID-19 risk in non-frail older adults with low cardiovascular risk was up to 84% lower than in those who were frail with cardiovascular risk factors. This could contribute to future work on stratification of shielding risk in older adults in future COVID-19 surges. *Planned data updates prior to the conference should enable updates to 2020.","Masoli, J; Atkins, J; Delgado, J; Pilling, L; Melzer, D",Age Ageing,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7989621/,402

Yet, they consistently encounter several constraints such as financing, which impede innovation, growth and internationalisation. This paper examines the external finance-innovation nexus for SMEs operating in five non-oil Arab countries—Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon, Morocco and Tunisia. To achieve this, a probit regression with instrumental variables is applied to firm-level data from the World Bank Enterprise Surveys. The primary findings reveal that the external finance providers are more likely to be reluctant to fund SMEs’ innovation; yet, it thrives with finance. The findings accord with the hypothesis that the accessibility to external funds is a mainstay of SMEs’ innovation. There is a need to develop policies that support equity and debt capitals for innovative SMEs.","Bakhouche, Abderazak",J Knowl Econ,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8067786/,402

These make a better understanding and the exploration of the CS of molecules a research hotspot. While it is generally easy to computationally explore the CS of small molecules (such as peptides and ligands), the exploration of the CS of a larger biomolecule beyond the local energy well and beyond the initial equilibrium structure of the molecule is generally nontrivial and can often be computationally prohibitive for molecules of considerable size. Therefore, research efforts in this area focus on the development of ways that systematically favor the sampling of new conformations while penalizing the resampling of previously sampled conformations. In this work, we present Deep Enhanced Sampling of Proteins’ Conformation Spaces Using AI-Inspired Biasing Forces (DESP), a technique for enhanced sampling that combines molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and deep neural networks (DNNs), in which biasing potentials for guiding the MD simulations are derived from the KL divergence between the DNN-learned latent space vectors of [a] the most recently sampled conformation and those of [b] the previously sampled conformations. Overall, DESP efficiently samples wide CS and outperforms conventional MD simulations as well as accelerated MD simulations. We acknowledge that this is an actively evolving research area, and we continue to further develop the techniques presented here and their derivatives tailored at achieving DNN-enhanced steered MD simulations and DNN-enhanced targeted MD simulations.","Salawu, Emmanuel Oluwatobi",Front Mol Biosci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8132871/,402
53255,147 A Meta-Analysis Comparing the Diagnostic Accuracy of Initial RT-PCR And CT Scan in Suspected COVID-19 Patients,2021-05-04,"Introduction: The reported prevalence of malignancy in thyroid nodules ranges from 4% to approximately 10%, with a small percentage (~2-8%) being medullary thyroid cancer (MTC). During the COVID-19 pandemic, elective thyroid FNA was temporarily halted at our institution. In response to this, our institution has devised a new protocol to aid in the detection of MTC, which includes serum calcitonin measurement as a surrogate marker for potential MTC. A severely elevated calcitonin (>100 pg/mL) is considered for surgery even without FNA diagnosis. We present a case of MTC that was detected due to the adopting of this protocol during COVID-19 pandemic at the Phoenix VAMC. Case Presentation: 71 year old male with an incidentally noted 3.0 cm solid, hypoechoic nodule with internal calcification, TI-RADS category 5. TSH level was normal at 3.309 mIU/mL. The patient denied any personal or family history of thyroid cancer, MEN syndrome, radiation exposure, or compressive symptoms. Following established protocol published by our institution in clinical thyroidology we performed a serum calcitonin that came back elevated at 1515 pg/mL (normal < 10 pg/mL). Given the marked elevation in serum calcitonin levels and highly suspicious radiographic appearance of the thyroid nodule, we strongly suspected medullary thyroid cancer and elected to send him directly for total thyroidectomy without performing FNA. The patient underwent total thyroidectomy with central neck dissection. Pathology showed a 3.2 cm medullary thyroid carcinoma without extrathyroidal extension or perineural invasion. Lymphovascular invasion was present. 6/10 central comparement lymph nodes were positive for metastatic disease. Postoperative calcitonin level was 2 pg/mL. Discussion: Our patient had markedly elevated serum calcitonin levels in addition to a high-risk ultrasonographic features, which was highly suspicious for MTC. Per our COVID-19 protocol, we measured the serum calcitonin level to screen for MTC and then referred him directly to surgery without FNA given the high suspicion for MTC. By using this protocol, we were able to diagnose and treat MTC expeditiously. The measurement of serum calcitonin is still controversial in the U.S, with the ATA remaining equivocal on this method. We believe that our case can serve as a practical example that validates our institution’s use of calcitonin screening of thyroid nodules in diagnosing MTC during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Mortensen, Michael; Dong, JiaXi; Vinales, Karyne Lima; Correa, Ricardo Rafael",J Endocr Soc,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8135394/,402
53519,Extracorporeal Cytokine Hemadsorption in Severe COVID-19 Respiratory Failure,2021-05-26,"FUNDING ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS: Type of funding sources: None. INTRODUCTION: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is recognized as a major public health issue and remains the leading cause of mortality worldwide. There is a clear association between adiposity, blood lipid profile, and adherence to the Mediterranean diet (MD) with the risk of CVD. However, the assessment of body composition parameters, dietary patterns and nutritional intervention in CVD patients undergoing a cardiovascular rehabilitation (CR) program remains insufficient. PURPOSE: to characterize body composition, lipid profile and MD adherence in patients with CVD who were attending an exercise-based CR program during COVID-19 era. METHODS: The study was developed between October 2020 and January 2021 in a phase III centre-based CR program. Body composition was assessed by dual energy x-ray absorptiometry Hologic Explorer-W. Adherence to the MD was assessed by the 14-item MD questionnaire. Fasting blood sample was taken for measurement of lipid profile. RESULTS: A sample of 41 patients (mean age 64.4 ± 7.9 years, 87.8% male) was evaluated. The most prevalent CVD were coronary artery disease (89.5%) and heart failure (21.1%). The main CVD risk factors at admission in the CR program were dyslipidaemia (71.1%), hypertension (68.4%), physical inactivity (26.3%) and diabetes mellitus (21.0%). In our sample the mean body mass index was 28 ± 3.8 kg/m2, being most patients overweight (75.6%), and having a substantially increased risk of metabolic complications (85.3%) accordingly to waist-hip ratio. Body composition assessment showed that 14.6% of the patients had a body fat mass index above 90th percentile. Although only 9.8% of the patients had reduced fat free mass, 17.1% showed appendicular lean mass below the reference value. In addition, less than one third of the patients (31.7%) revealed a high adherence to the MD pattern. A sub-analysis on blood lipids (n = 26) showed that most patients had levels of LDL cholesterol (76.9%) and non-HDL cholesterol (65.4%) above the therapeutic target and 15.4% had triglycerides higher than 150 mg/dl. CONCLUSION: Body composition, lipid profile and dietary patterns, play a major role in CVD secondary prevention. Our findings showed that a substantial number of CVD patients, in COVID-19 era, did not have optimal body composition, were above lipid profile targets, and had a low/medium adherence to the MD. Thus, this study highlights the relevance of nutrition on cardiometabolic status and demonstrates the crucial role of nutritional intervention as an integrated part of a long-term phase III CR program. Moreover, further research about nutritional intervention in patients undergoing CR is warranted.","Linan Pinto, M; Pinto, R; Charneca, S; Vasques, J; Lemos Pires, M; Borges, M; Rodrigues, C; Alves Da Silva, P; Ricardo, I; Santa-Clara, H; Abreu, A; Pinto, FJ; Sousa Guerreiro, C",Eur J Prev Cardiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8136058/,402

57778,Systematic Review on the Efficacy and Safety of Oral Janus Kinase Inhibitors for the Treatment of Atopic Dermatitis,2021-09-01,"BACKGROUND: HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is a way to prevent HIV infection using antiretroviral medications. However, common barriers to PrEP engagement include lack of access to prescribers; discomfort seeking sexual health services; and racism, homophobia, and transphobia in medical contexts. Key populations (eg, communities of color, young men who have sex with men, and transgender women) are underrepresented in terms of PrEP uptake in the United States. Nurx is an innovative company that has offered internet-based access to PrEP since 2016. OBJECTIVE: In this study, in partnership with Nurx, we aim to explore clients’ experiences of digital PrEP access—including the difference made by the telehealth format—and to understand whether Nurx helped reduce barriers to PrEP. METHODS: Electronic chart review and semistructured interviews were conducted with 31 PrEP requesters from California, Florida, Illinois, and New York. Interviews were recorded, transcribed, and subjected to inductive and deductive thematic analysis. RESULTS: Some interviewees reported initial skepticism about whether a web-based PrEP service could be legitimate or feasible. Despite this, most clients were effusive about their eventual Nurx experience, and many reported that Nurx eased barriers to PrEP access through the availability of knowledgeable, willing prescribers and minimizing embarrassment and discrimination. Our analysis suggests Nurx produced satisfaction by achieving an acceptable balance between 2 client desires: efficiency and humanity. Efficiency encompasses the simplicity, speed, and convenience of obtaining PrEP, both regarding the Nurx process itself and in comparison with in-person encounters. Humanity covers clients’ wish for personalized, responsive interaction and a feeling of connection or care. Nurx’s messaging platform was crucial to manifesting these qualities and was largely interpreted through the familiar frame of texting. Clients conceived efficiency and humanity as inversely related in a commercial enterprise and varied in the particular balance they felt was optimal. Those who wished for slightly more humanity than the service afforded used the concept of a trade-off to explain why Nurx remained appealing. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings augment evidence that internet-based PrEP provision can broaden access to this HIV prevention strategy. This important finding, notwithstanding a few provisos, merits mention. Telehealth, as practiced by Nurx, was still dependent on culturally competent medical providers as system inputs, and the very technology used to overcome access barriers (ie, the internet) generated new hurdles for some clients. Furthermore, clients did not interpret Nurx in a vacuum: their past experiences and the social and structural context mattered. Finally, only granular inquiry revealed precisely how Nurx satisfied clients whose experiences and preferences fell within a particular range. Extrapolating from this, we urge scholars not to fetishize technological solutions but rather to interrogate the ways in which any intervention’s design works for certain kinds of patients.","Hughes, Shana D; Koester, Kimberly A; Engesaeth, Edvard; Hawkins, Merissa V; Grant, Robert M",J Med Internet Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8406118/,402

61326,"Misplacement of left-sided double-lumen tubes into the right mainstem bronchus: incidence, risk factors and blind repositioning techniques.",2015,"BACKGROUND Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS) is commonly administered to Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) patients taking psychotropic medications, yet the effects on treatment outcomes remain unknown. We explored how concomitant medication use relates to clinical response to a standard course of rTMS. METHODS Medications were tabulated for 181 MDD patients who underwent a six-week rTMS treatment course. All patients received 10 Hz rTMS administered to left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), with 1 Hz administered to right DLPFC in patients with inadequate response to and/or intolerance of left-sided stimulation. Primary outcomes were change in Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology Self Report (IDS-SR30) total score after 2, 4, and 6 weeks. RESULTS Use of benzodiazepines was associated with less improvement at week 2, whereas use of psychostimulants was associated with greater improvement at week 2 and across 6 weeks. These effects were significant controlling for baseline variables including age, overall symptom severity, and severity of anxiety symptoms. Response rates at week 6 were lower in benzodiazepine users versus non-users (16.4% vs. 35.5%, p = 0.008), and higher in psychostimulant users versus non-users (39.2% vs. 22.0%, p = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS Concomitant medication use may impact rTMS treatment outcome. While the differences reported here could be considered clinically significant, results were not corrected for multiple comparisons and findings should be replicated before clinicians incorporate the evidence into clinical practice. Prospective, hypothesis-based treatment studies will aid in determining causal relationships between medication treatments and outcome.","Hunter, Aimee M; Minzenberg, Michael J; Cook, Ian A; Krantz, David E; Levitt, Jennifer G; Rotstein, Natalie M; Chawla, Shweta A; Leuchter, Andrew F",Brain and behavior,https://doi.org/10.1002/brb3.1275; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30941915/,402
61343,Using therapeutic plasma exchange as a rescue therapy in CoVID-19 patients: a case series.,2020-05-07,"The HA of influenza virus is a receptor-binding and fusion protein that is required to initiate infection. The HA receptor-binding domain determines the species of sialyl receptors recognized by influenza viruses. Here, we demonstrate that changes in the HA receptor-binding domain alter the ability of the H5N1 virus to spread systemically in mice. The A/Vietnam/1203/04 (VN1203) and A/Hong Kong/213/03 (HK213) viruses are consistently lethal to domestic chickens but differ in their pathogenicity to mammals. Insertion of the VN1203 HA and neuraminidase (NA) genes into recombinant HK213 virus expanded its tissue tropism and increased its lethality in mice; conversely, insertion of HK213 HA and NA genes into recombinant VN1203 virus decreased its systemic spread and lethality. The VN1203 and HK213 HAs differ by 10 aa, and HK213 HA has shown greater binding affinity for synthetic alpha2,6-linked sialyl receptor. Introduction of an S227N change and removal of N-linked glycosylation at residue 158 increased the alpha2,6-binding affinity of VN1203 HA. Recombinant VN1203 virus carrying the S227N change alone or with the residue-158 glycosylation site removed showed reduced lethality and systemic spread in mice but not in domestic chickens. Wild-type VN1203 virus exhibited the greatest efficiency in systemic spread after intramuscular inoculation and in infection of mouse bone marrow-derived dendritic cells and conventional pulmonary dendritic cells. These results show that VN1203 HA glycoprotein confers pathogenicity by facilitating systemic spread in mice; they also suggest that a minor change in receptor binding domain may modulate the virulence of H5N1 viruses.","Yen, Hui-Ling; Aldridge, Jerry R; Boon, Adrianus C M; Ilyushina, Natalia A; Salomon, Rachelle; Hulse-Post, Diane J; Marjuki, Henju; Franks, John; Boltz, David A; Bush, Dorothy; Lipatov, Aleksandr S; Webby, Richard J; Rehg, Jerold E; Webster, Robert G",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.0811052106; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19116267/,402

This study applies psychological reactance theory to examine COVID-19 message factors (i.e., message fatigue, issue importance) that may be linked to nonadherence to CDC recommendations via the experience of reactance. Participants (N = 268) were current U.S. residents over the age of 18 who completed an online survey about their perceptions of COVID-19 messaging in general as well as toward a specific COVID-19 message they recalled. Results of structural equation modeling indicated that perceived freedom threat toward a COVID-19 message was predicted positively by message fatigue and negatively by issue importance. Greater perceived freedom threat was linked to greater reactance, which in turn was associated with lower levels of adherence to hygiene- and social-related COVID-19 preventive behavior. Notably, the negative association between reactance and social-related adherence was stronger than that between reactance and hygiene-related adherence. Implications for the role of reactance in risk and crisis communication as well as for public health messaging during the COVID-19 pandemic are discussed.","Ball, Hannah; Wozniak, Tayah Renea",Health communication,https://doi.org/10.1080/10410236.2021.1920717; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33941005/,402

62920,Effect of Electroencephalography-Guided Anesthetic Administration on Postoperative Delirium Among Older Adults Undergoing Major Surgery: The ENGAGES Randomized Clinical Trial.,2019,"PURPOSE To determine the performance of radiologists with different levels of expertise regarding the differentiation of COVID-19 from other atypical pneumonias. Chest CT to identify patients suffering from COVID-19 has been reported to be limited by its low specificity for distinguishing COVID-19 from other atypical pneumonias (""COVID-19 mimics""). Meanwhile, the understanding of the morphologic patterns of COVID-19 has improved and they appear to be fairly specific. MATERIALS AND METHODS Between 02/2020 and 04/2020, 60 patients with COVID-19 pneumonia underwent chest CT in our department. Cases were matched with a comparable control group of 60 patients of similar age, sex, and comorbidities, who underwent chest CT prior to 01/2020 for atypical pneumonia caused by other pathogens. Included were other viral, fungal, and bacterial pathogens. All 120 cases were blinded to patient history and were reviewed independently by two radiologists and two radiology residents. Readers rated the probability of COVID-19 pneumonia according to the COV-RADS classification system. Results were analyzed using Clopper-Pearson 95 % confidence intervals, Youden's Index for test quality criteria, and Fleiss' kappa statistics. RESULTS Overall, readers were able to correctly identify the presence of COVID-19 pneumonia in 219/240 (sensitivity: 91 %; 95 %-CI; 86.9 %-94.5 %), and to correctly attribute CT findings to COVID-19 mimics in 159/240 ratings (specificity: 66.3 %; 59.9 %-72.2 %), yielding an overall diagnostic accuracy of 78.8 % (378/480; 74.8 %-82.3 %). Individual reader accuracy ranged from 74.2 % (89/120) to 84.2 % (101/120) and did not correlate significantly with reader expertise. Youden's Index was 0.57. Between-reader agreement was moderate (κ = 0.53). CONCLUSION In this enriched cohort, radiologists were able to distinguish COVID-19 from ""COVID-19 mimics"" with moderate diagnostic accuracy. Accuracy did not correlate with reader expertise. KEY POINTS · In a scenario of direct comparison (no negative findings), CT allows the differentiation of COVID-19 from other atypical pneumonias (""COVID mimics"") with moderate accuracy.. · Reader expertise did not significantly influence these results.. · Despite similar patterns and distributions of pulmonary findings, radiologists were able to estimate the probability of COVID-19 pneumonia using the COV-RADS classification in a standardized manner in the larger proportion of cases..

CASE REPORTS Four patients aged 54 to 63 years old with underlying malignancies were referred for treatment of SVC syndrome. All received isolated pharmacomechanical thrombolysis (IPMT) with tissue plasminogen activator delivered in a Trellis Peripheral Infusion System that removed obstructive clot in minutes versus the 24 to 48 hours required for traditional catheter-directed thrombolysis. In each case, stents were inserted immediately following IPMT in a combined procedure lasting <1 hour. Patients exhibited near-immediate relief of debilitating symptoms; completion venography demonstrated patent vessels with excellent blood flow. CONCLUSION Combining IPMT with immediate stenting during the same session is an effective method for managing acute thrombotic SVC syndrome and limiting the exposure time and number of interventions performed on seriously ill patients.","O'Sullivan, Gerard J; Mhuircheartaigh, Jennifer Ni; Ferguson, David; Delappe, Eithne; O'Riordan, Conor; Browne, Ann Michelle",Journal of endovascular therapy : an official journal of the International Society of Endovascular Specialists,https://doi.org/10.1583/09-2940.1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20199277/,402
64226,Using bispectral index and cerebral oximetry to guide hemodynamic therapy in high-risk surgical patients.,2013,"Background Patiromer and sodium zirconium cyclosilicate (SZC) are newer options for hyperkalemia treatment. This systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted to assess the safety and side effect profile of patiromer and SZC compared with placebo or other standards of care in the management of hyperkalemia. Methods We searched electronic databases for relevant articles. The screening was performed independently and data were extracted among the selected studies. We performed a statistical analysis on Revman 5.4 software. The odds ratio (OR) was used for outcome estimation with a 95% CI. Results Patiromer had lower rates of hyperkalemia (OR = 0.44; 95% CI, 0.22-0.89) compared with standard of care. The analysis showed no significant differences between the 2 groups in terms of overall adverse effects, any serious/specific adverse effects, or treatment discontinuation as a result of adverse effects. Comparing the SZC-10 group with standard of care showed no significant differences in the occurrence of hyperkalemia during treatment, overall adverse effects, any serious/specific adverse effects, or treatment discontinuation as a result of adverse effects but showed a higher rate of edema in the treatment group (OR = 6.77; 95% CI, 1.03-44.25). Similarly, no significant differences were seen between the 2 SZC doses for the occurrence of any adverse effects, hyperkalemia, constipation, diarrhea, or urinary tract infection, whereas edema was higher among patients receiving SZC-10 (OR = 3.13; 95% CI, 1.19-8.27). Conclusions In patients with acute hyperkalemia, SZC is the drug of choice due to its more rapid reduction of serum potassium level, whereas in patients with chronic hyperkalemia, patiromer appears to be the drug of choice because SZC is associated with an increase in edema, likely due to an increase in sodium absorption, which could have important adverse consequences in patients with chronic kidney disease and or heart failure. Thus, both drugs were found to be safe while treating hyperkalemia.

METHOD we reviewed research published in PubMed, Web of Science, PsychInfo, Scopus, Scielo, and ProQuest Psychology databases, from January 2008 to April 2019. The review followed a two-stage process. In the first stage, we selected only studies using neutral stimuli paradigms, while in the second we selected executive-emotional paradigms. RESULTS The first stage of the review provided 16 final results, while the second stage, with emotional stimuli, provided 3 results. CONCLUSIONS There is some initial evidence for the existence of executive impairments in OCD, as expressed in the performance and/or processing of working memory inhibitory control and cognitive flexibility. There is also initial evidence that these latter two could be modulated by the presentation or mental representation of negative valence stimuli or images, as well as the presence of aversive contingencies.","Tubío Fungueiriño, María; Fernández Prieto, Montse; Carvalho, Sandra; Leite, Jorge; Carracedo, Ángel; Gonçalves, Óscar F",Psicothema,https://doi.org/10.7334/psicothema2019.187; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31954412/,402

METHODS We compared patients who underwent SIL colectomy for colon cancer with an equal number of case-matched LAP colectomy patients based on age, gender, body mass index (BMI), American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) score, previous abdominal operations, and operation type. Results of oncologic resection included lymph node (LN) yield and margins. One-year outcomes included cancer recurrence and death. RESULTS Twenty-six patients were identified for SIL and LAP colectomy groups with no differences in case matching (age, P = .70; gender, P > .99; BMI, P = .74; ASA score, P > .99; previous abdominal operation, P > .99; and operation-type, P > .99). Oncologic resection was similar for both groups. Mean LN yield was 17 (P = .88). There were no positive margins and 2 (8%) patients had proximal/distal margin of <5 cm in each group. The mean follow-up was 13 and 21 months for the SIL and LAP groups, respectively (P < .001), with 2(8%) recurrences in each group, and no port-site recurrences or deaths. Disease-free survival at 1 year was 92% for both groups. CONCLUSION These data suggest that SIL colectomy for cancer provides equivalent oncologic resection and 1-year outcomes compared with a standard LAP technique. Further studies are required to determine long-term oncologic outcomes, including recurrence and survival rates.","Papaconstantinou, Harry T; Thomas, J Scott",Surgery,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.surg.2011.07.060; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22000196/,402

METHOD Thirty post-Caesarean section patients from a private hospital in Perth, Western Australia, were audited in a three-phase project: (i) the initial audit; (ii) clinical practice change including greater venous thromboembolism awareness and targeted education for midwives, standardised guidelines for mechanical prophylaxis, the development of an online venous thromboembolism module, a venous thromboembolism prophylaxis policy and heightened consumer involvement; and (iii) a follow-up audit. RESULTS Our initial audit result demonstrated opportunities for improvement across all audit criteria. The interventions were undertaken over a 3-month period from August to October 2010. The follow-up audit results showed pleasing improvements across four audit criteria with one criterion unchanged. CONCLUSION While the follow-up audit showed significant clinical improvements, the tight time frame for the development and implementation of multiple interventions created major challenges. We believe that given time to embed these changes, further improvements will be seen. Ongoing audits will be conducted to ensure the sustainability of these changes.

MATERIAL AND METHODS Twenty-one rabbits were divided into three groups of seven each: (1) control, (2) hepatic artery occlusion, and (3) portal vein occlusion by a balloon catheter. For each rabbit, two or three RFA sessions were performed using an electrode needle. Ablation time, temperature around the tip of RFA needle at the end of RFA, ablation volume on fat-suppressed T1-weighted image in the hepatobiliary phase, and coagulative necrosis area on histopathology were measured and compared between the three groups using the Kruskal-Wallis paired Mann-Whitney U tests. RESULTS In 43 RFA sessions (group 1, 15; group 2, 14; group 3, 14), mean tissue temperature in group 3 (77.0 °C ± 7.7 °C) was significantly higher compared to groups 1 (59.2 °C ± 18.8 °C; P = 0.010) and 2 (67.5 °C ± 9.9 °C; P = 0.010). In addition, mean ablation volume and coagulative necrosis in group 3 (2.10 ± 1.37 mm3 and 0.86 ± 0.28 mm2, respectively) were larger compared to groups 1 (0.84 ± 0.30 mm3; P < 0.001 and 0.55 ± 0.26 mm2; P = 0.020, respectively) and 2 (0.89 ± 0.59 mm3; P = 0.002 and 0.60 ± 0.22 mm2; P = 0.024, respectively).

We aimed to clarify the clinical significance of hematologic parameters alteration in COVID-19. Methods: Different hematologic parameters were measured in 225 hospitalized COVID-19 patients in a tertiary care university hospital, during the peak of COVID-19 outbreak and their association with duration of hospitalization, ICU admission and especially mortality was analyzed. Results: Among a total of 225 patients, 24.4% did not survive after admission. Lymphopenia and neutrophilia were observed in 52.7% and 21.4% of the patients, respectively. The mean count of neutrophils was significantly higher in non-survived patients (P = .032). Elevated neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) was significantly associated with mortality (P < .001). Low hemoglobin (Hb) concentration significantly correlated with mortality (P = .004) and ICU admission (P = .04). Platelet (Plt) count was significantly lower in the non-survived patients (P = .023). Non-survivors had significantly lower nadir Hb and Plt counts than survivors (P < .001 in both parameters). Platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR) also correlated with mortality and was significantly higher in non-survivors (P = .034). Conclusions: Hematologic laboratory parameters have always been a crucial component of diagnostic and therapeutic strategies in infectious disease. Hematologic predictors of a fatal outcome in COVID19 hospitalized patients in our series include elevated NLR and PLR, lower than normal Hb and Plt, elevated d-dimer and prolonged prothrombin time (PT), together with elevated inflammatory indicators in the blood.","Mousavi, Seied Asadollah; Rad, Soroush; Rostami, Tahereh; Rostami, Mohammadreza; Mousavi, Seyed Ali; Mirhoseini, Seied Amirhosein; Kiumarsi, Azadeh",Hematology,https://doi.org/10.1080/16078454.2020.1833435; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33124971/,402
69411,Serious adverse events following treatment of visceral leishmaniasis: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,2021-03-29,"Guillain-Barré syndrome is the most common cause of acute flaccid paralysis worldwide. Most patients present with an antecedent illness, most commonly upper respiratory tract infection, before the onset of progressive motor weakness. Several microorganisms have been associated with Guillain-Barré syndrome, most notably Campylobacter jejuni, Zika virus, and in 2020, the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. In C jejuni-related Guillain-Barré syndrome, there is good evidence to support an autoantibody-mediated immune process that is triggered by molecular mimicry between structural components of peripheral nerves and the microorganism. Making a diagnosis of so-called classical Guillain-Barré syndrome is straightforward; however, the existing diagnostic criteria have limitations and can result in some variants of the syndrome being missed. Most patients with Guillain-Barré syndrome do well with immunotherapy, but a substantial proportion are left with disability, and death can occur. Results from the International Guillain-Barré Syndrome Outcome Study suggest that geographical variations exist in Guillain-Barré syndrome, including insufficient access to immunotherapy in low-income countries. There is a need to provide improved access to treatment for all patients with Guillain-Barré syndrome, and to develop effective disease-modifying therapies that can limit the extent of nerve injury. Clinical trials are currently underway to investigate some of the potential therapeutic candidates, including complement inhibitors, which, together with emerging data from large international collaborative studies on the syndrome, will contribute substantially to understanding the many facets of this disease.","Shahrizaila, Nortina; Lehmann, Helmar C; Kuwabara, Satoshi",Lancet,https://doi.org/10.1016/s0140-6736(21)00517-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33647239/,402

Increases in global commerce and average herd size, urbanization, vertical integration within the industry and alterations in global climate patterns have allowed the spread of pathogenic viruses, or the introduction of new viral species, into regions previously free of such pathogens, creating the potential for widespread morbidity and mortality in naïve cattle populations. Despite this, no antiviral products are currently commercially licensed for use in bovine medicine, although significant progress has been made in the development of antivirals for use against bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV), foot and mouth disease virus (FMDV) and bovine herpesvirus (BHV). BVDV is extensively studied as a model virus for human antiviral studies. Consequently, many compounds with efficacy have been identified and a few have been successfully used to prevent infection in vivo although commercial development is still lacking. FMDV is also the subject of extensive antiviral testing due to the importance of outbreak containment for maintenance of export markets. Thirdly, BHV presents an attractive target for antiviral development due to its worldwide presence. Antiviral studies for other bovine viral pathogens are largely limited to preliminary studies. This review summarizes the current state of knowledge of antiviral compounds against several key bovine pathogens and the potential for commercial antiviral applications in the prevention and control of several selected bovine diseases.","Newcomer, Benjamin W; Walz, Paul H; Givens, M Daniel",Animal health research reviews,https://doi.org/10.1017/s1466252314000048; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24810855/,402

At present, only rodent-borne hantaviruses are associated with severe illness in humans. New species of hantaviruses have been recently identified in bats and shrews greatly expanding the potential reservoirs and ranges of these viruses. Brazil has one of the highest incidences of hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome in South America, hence it is critical to know what is the prevalence of hantaviruses in Brazil. Although much is known about rodent reservoirs, little is known regarding bats. We captured 270 bats from February 2012 to April 2014. Serum was screened for the presence of antibodies against a recombinant nucleoprotein (rN) of Araraquara virus (ARAQV). The prevalence of antibody to hantavirus was 9/53 with an overall seroprevalence of 17%.

This study aimed to synthesize findings from qualitative studies of patients' experiences of factors that facilitate and hinder adherence to medication. A systematic review of qualitative studies adhering to the Enhancing transparency in reporting the synthesis of qualitative research (ENTREQ) framework. Systematic searches were conducted in several databases. We used thematic synthesis and the Confidence in the Evidence from Reviews of Qualitative Research (CERQual) approach to assess the confidence of the evidence.

We identified three analytical themes; logistics, benchmarking the need for medication; and the quality of the patient-physician relationship, with seven descriptive sub-themes as factors influencing patients' adherence to medications. Helping patients to map their everyday activities and motivating them to associate medications with everyday activities may facilitate adherence to medications. Addressing patient beliefs about medications, supporting patients in coping with side effects of medications and eliciting patients' wishes for involvement in treatment decisions may also facilitate adherence. Barriers to adherence were the costs of buying medications, and lacking understanding of the indications and effects of medications. The findings in this synthesis resonate with previous research and extend the known literature by synthesizing and formally assessing confidence in the evidence.","Mechta Nielsen, Trine; Frøjk Juhl, Metha; Feldt-Rasmussen, Bo; Thomsen, Thordis",Clinical kidney journal,https://doi.org/10.1093/ckj/sfx140; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30094015/,402

METHODS Between March 2009 and December 2011, 39 consecutive open total gastrectomies (OTGs) and 36 LTGs using TOA for gastric cancer were comparatively evaluated. We investigated postoperative complications, using the Clavien-Dindo classification. To evaluate the effect of a learning period in using TOA for LTG, we also investigated shifts in the patterns of complications and changes in total operation time over the course of the study. RESULTS The patient characteristics at baseline were not different between both groups, except for the extent of lymphadenectomy (P < 0.001) and depth of tumor invasion (P = 0.003). Multivariate analysis revealed that TOA usage elevated the occurrence of infectious complications significantly (OR = 3.32, P = 0.042), but was not associated with EJ-related complications. TOA usage did not need a learning period for the length of time required to complete the operation, or the likelihood of developing an EJ-related or infectious complication. CONCLUSIONS TOA use for EJ during LTG is relatively simple and easy enough not to require a learning period for surgeons. This procedure did not elevated the occurrence of EJ-related complications compared to circular stapling in open surgery, but it does require special prevention efforts to avoid infectious complications.","Kwon, Y; Cho, S I; Kwon, Y J; Yang, K S; Jang, Y J; Kim, J H; Park, S H; Mok, Y-J; Park, S",European journal of surgical oncology : the journal of the European Society of Surgical Oncology and the British Association of Surgical Oncology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejso.2013.11.018; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24373299/,402

Assessment of cardiac function in AIS patients using cardiovascular MRI (CMR) may help to detect HF. We report the rate of systolic and diastolic dysfunction in a cohort of patients with AIS using CMR and compare cine real-time (CRT) sequences with the reference of segmented cine steady-state free precession sequences. METHODS AND RESULTS Patients with AIS without known atrial fibrillation were prospectively enrolled in the HEart and BRain Interfaces in Acute Ischemic Stroke (HEBRAS) study (NCT02142413) and underwent CMR at 3 Tesla within 7 days after AIS. Validity of CRT sequences was determined in 50 patients. A total of 229 patients were included in the analysis (mean age 66 years; 35% women; HF 2%). Evaluation of cardiac function was successful in 172 (75%) patients. Median time from stroke onset to CMR was 82 h (interquartile range 56-111) and 54 h (interquartile range 31-78) from cerebral MRI to CMR. Systolic dysfunction was observed in 43 (25%) and diastolic dysfunction in 102 (59%) patients. Diagnostic yield was similar using CRT or segmented cine imaging (no significant difference in left ventricular ejection fraction, myocardial mass, time to peak filling rate, and peak filling rate ratio E/A). Intraobserver and interobserver agreement was high (κ = 0.78-1.0 for all modalities). CONCLUSIONS Cardiovascular MRI at 3 Tesla is an appropriate method for the evaluation of cardiac function in a selected cohort of patients with AIS. Systolic and diastolic dysfunction is frequent in these patients.

We examined associations between male occupational stress and fecundability. We used data from Pregnancy Study Online (PRESTO), a North American preconception cohort study. At baseline (2013-2019), male participants aged ≥ 21 years completed a baseline questionnaire on employment status, hours worked per week, time of day worked (daytime, evening, nights, and changing or rotating shifts), and job title. We used the O*NET occupational database to rate independence by job title. Female partners were followed via bimonthly follow-up questionnaires for 12 months or until pregnancy. We restricted analyses to 1,818 couples attempting conception for ≤ 6 cycles at enrollment. We used proportional probabilities regression to estimate fecundability ratios (FRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). The FR comparing unemployed with employed men was0.84 (95% CI: 0.62-1.14). Among employed men, FRs and 95% CIs for evening shift work, night shift work, and rotating shift work were 0.89 (95% CI: 0.68-1.17), 0.94 (95% CI: 0.66-1.33), and 0.91 (95% CI: 0.75-1.11) relative to daytime shift work. The FR for any nondaytime shift work was 0.91 (95% CI: 0.78-1.07). Total work hours (long or short) and job independence scores were not appreciably associated with fecundability. Total hours worked was not associated with time to pregnancy. Working nondaytime shifts and being unemployed were associated with slightly decreased fecundability. However, the variability in these estimates was substantial and the results were reasonably consistent with chance. Little association was observed for other occupation measures.

Moreover, the efficiency of DNA repair in autism must be improved to correct these alterations. We examined whether 3-aminobenzamide (3-AB) could reverse these alterations. We conducted experiments to clarify the molecular mechanism underlying these ameliorations. An assessment of genetic and epigenetic alterations by a modified comet assay showed elevated levels of oxidative DNA strand breaks and DNA hypermethylation in BTBR T+Itpr3tf/J (BTBR) mice used as a model of autism. Oxidative DNA strand breaks and DNA methylation were further quantified fluorometrically, and the results showed similar changes. Conversely, 3-AB treated BTBR mice showed a significant reduction in these alterations compared with untreated mice. The expressions of 43 genes involved in DNA repair were altered in BTBR mice. RT2 Profiler PCR Array revealed significantly altered expression of seven genes, which was confirmed by RT-PCR analyses. 3-AB treatment relieved these disturbances and significantly improved Ogg1 and Rad1 up-regulation. Moreover, autism-like behaviors were also mitigated in BTBR animals by 3-AB treatment without alterations in locomotor activities. The simultaneous effects of reduced DNA damage and DNA methylation levels as well as the regulation of repair gene expression indicate the potential of 3-AB as a therapeutic agent to decrease the levels of DNA damage and DNA methylation in autistic patients. The current data may help in the development of therapies that ultimately provide a better quality of life for individuals suffering from autism.","Attia, S M; Ahmad, S F; Nadeem, A; Attia, M S M; Ansari, M A; As Sobeai, H M; Al-Mazroua, H A; Alasmari, A F; Bakheet, S A","Pharmacology, biochemistry, and behavior",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pbb.2020.173057; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33069747/,402

DATABASES SOURCES PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library were searched through August 21, 2020. Search strategies used a combination of subject headings (e.g., MeSH in PubMed) and keywords for the following two concepts: cochlear implantation and tinnitus. STUDY SELECTION English articles reporting on pre-intervention tinnitus-related patient-reported outcome measures (e.g., Tinnitus Handicap Inventory [THI], Tinnitus Questionnaire [TQ], Visual Analogue Scale [VAS] for loudness) and quality of life measures (e.g., Nijmegen Cochlear Implantation Questionnaire [NCIQ] and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale [HADS]) for CI recipients were included. DATA EXTRACTION Demographics, baseline, and follow-up data. DATA SYNTHESIS Total of 27 articles reporting on 1,285 patients (mean age 54.5 years, range 14-81) were included. Meta-analysis of all tinnitus-related measures demonstrated improvement following implantation, with a mean difference of -23.2 [95% CI: -28.8 to -17.7], -12.6 [95% CI: -17.5 to -7.8], and -4.5 [95% CI: -5.5 to -3.4] (p < 0.05 for all) for THI, TQ, and VAS, respectively.

81705,Moving From Robotic to Personalized COVID-19 Care.,2020-06-25,"BACKGROUND This study examined the acute effect of intravenous S-nitroso human serum albumin (S-NO-HSA) infusion on overall hemodynamics and oxidative stress in a chronic left-to-right shunt-induced pulmonary arterial hypertension model with right ventricle (RV) failure. METHODS An aortocaval fistula (pulmonary-to-systemic blood flow ratio [Qp/Qs] > 2.0) was surgically created in 50 male Wistar rats. After 10 weeks, they were randomly treated with S-NO-HSA (n = 20) or human serum albumin (HSA; n = 25) infusion (0.5 µmol/kg/h) for 60 minutes. A sham group (n = 10) received S-NO-HSA. RV contractility, RV-vascular coupling, and ventricular interdependence were assessed in vivo at different pre-loads by biventricular conductance catheters. Heart and lung biopsy specimens were obtained for determination of high-energy phosphates, oxidative stress (oxidized glutathione/reduced glutathione), and endothelial nitric oxide synthase protein expression. RESULTS S-NO-HSA, compared with HSA infusion, reduced RV afterload expressed by effective pulmonary arterial elastance (Ea; 0.49 ± 0.3 vs 1.2 ± 0.2 mm Hg/ml; p = 0.0005) and improved RV diastolic function (slope of end-diastolic pressure-volume relationship) as well as contractility indicated by slope of end-systolic pressure-volume relationship (Ees). Therefore an increase in efficiency of ventricular-vascular coupling (Ees/Ea) occurred after S-NO-HSA (0.35 ± 0.17 to 0.94 ± 0.21; p = 0.005), but not HSA infusion, leading to positive effect on ventricular interdependence with increased left ventricular stroke volume (56% ± 4% vs 19% ± 5%; p = 0.0013). S-NO-HSA, compared with HSA, treatment improved adenosine 5'-triphosphate (13.9 ± 1.1 vs 7.0 ± 1.8 µmol/g protein) and phosphocreatine (5.9 ± 3.3 vs 1.9 ± 0.6 µmol/g protein; p = 0.01) RV content and decreased the tissue oxidized glutathione/reduced glutathione ratio (p = 0.001). CONCLUSIONS S-NO-HSA reduces pulmonary hypertension and improves RV systolic and diastolic function and RV-arterial coupling, with a positive effect on ventricular interdependence by increasing energetic reserve and reducing oxidative stress.","Rungatscher, Alessio; Hallström, Seth; Linardi, Daniele; Milani, Elisabetta; Gasser, Harald; Podesser, Bruno K; Scarabelli, Tiziano M; Luciani, Giovanni B; Faggian, Giuseppe",The Journal of heart and lung transplantation : the official publication of the International Society for Heart Transplantation,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.healun.2014.09.041; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25511748/,402

In this study, we used mouse hepatitis virus (MHV)-infected bone-marrow-derived macrophage (BMM) and cyclic phosphate cDNA sequencing to identify the RNA targets of EndoU. EndoU targeted viral RNA, cleaving the 3' side of pyrimidines with a strong preference for U↓A and C↓A sequences (endoY↓A). EndoU-dependent cleavage was detected in every region of MHV RNA, from the 5' NTR to the 3' NTR, including transcriptional regulatory sequences (TRS). Cleavage at two CA dinucleotides immediately adjacent to the MHV poly(A) tail suggest a mechanism to suppress negative-strand RNA synthesis and the accumulation of viral dsRNA. MHV with EndoU (EndoUmut) or 2'-5' phosphodiesterase (PDEmut) mutations provoked the activation of RNase L in BMM, with corresponding cleavage of RNAs by RNase L. The physiologic targets of EndoU are viral RNA templates required for negative-strand RNA synthesis and dsRNA accumulation. Coronavirus EndoU cleaves U↓A and C↓A sequences (endoY↓A) within viral (+) strand RNA to evade dsRNA-activated host responses.","Ancar, Rachel; Li, Yize; Kindler, Eveline; Cooper, Daphne A; Ransom, Monica; Thiel, Volker; Weiss, Susan R; Hesselberth, Jay R; Barton, David J",RNA,https://doi.org/10.1261/rna.076604.120; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32989044/,402

Given the unique patient population in neurosurgery, arising opportunities for integration and expansion of telemedicine into neurosurgery practice come with challenges for both the patient and the provider. Methods A literature review has been performed, and a survey has been sent out to neurosurgery providers in Texas to determine if providers are satisfied with the current state of telemedicine in their clinical practice. Results Patients who live far away from a medical center have cited increased convenience when routine postoperative visits have been converted to telemedicine. For providers, challenges have arisen in performing physical exams, especially when performing detailed neurological exams in the diagnosis of a spine disorder. Survey results of neurosurgery providers have revealed mixed opinions since the initiation of telemedicine. Conclusion Although it is unclear what role telemedicine will have after the social distancing restrictions are lifted, many providers surveyed have expressed interest in keeping telemedicine in their clinical practice.","Lyon, Kristopher A; Qi, Xiaoming; Benardete, Ethan A; Stevens, Alan B; Huang, Jason H",American journal of biomedical science & research,https://doi.org/10.34297/ajbsr.2020.09.001359; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34164624/,402

PATIENTS AND METHODS A total of 123 patients were included from 2006 to 2009, 52 received Ga-68 DOTATOC PET/CT (NETUP, 33; SNET, 19) and 71 underwent In-111 DTPA octreotide SPECT/CT (50; 21). The standard of reference included histopathology or clinical verification based on follow-up examinations. RESULTS In the NETUP group Ga-68 DOTATOC detected primaries in 15 patients (45.5%) and In-111 DTPA octreotide in 4 patients (8%) (p < 0.001); in the SNET group, only 2 primaries could be detected, all by Ga-68 DOTATOC. In patients with NETUP, primary tumors could be found significantly more often than in patients with SNET (p = 0.01). Out of these 21 patients 14 patients were operated. CONCLUSION Ga-68 DOTATOC PET/CT is preferable to In-111 DTPA octreotide SPECT/CT when searching for primary NETs in patients with NETUP but should be used with caution in patients with SNET.","Schreiter, Nils Friedemann; Bartels, Ann-Mirja; Froeling, Vera; Steffen, Ingo; Pape, Ulrich-Frank; Beck, Alexander; Hamm, Bernd; Brenner, Winfried; Röttgen, Rainer",Radiology and oncology,https://doi.org/10.2478/raon-2014-0018; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25435846/,402

It is unknown why some dogs show signs of bleeding whereas others do not despite clinically relevant thrombocytopenia. HYPOTHESIS/OBJECTIVES Activated platelets, decreased fibrinolysis or both mitigate bleeding tendency. Assess standard hemostatic variables, platelet dynamics, and specialized coagulation testing in dogs experimentally infected with E. canis to evaluate this clinical discrepancy. ANIMALS Four healthy laboratory beagles. METHODS Dogs were given blood infected with E. canis IV. Platelet indices of activation, platelet aggregometry, antiplatelet antibodies (percent IgG), complete coagulation panel, and thromboelastography (TEG) were measured before inoculation and on weeks 1-8. Dogs were treated with doxycycline at approximately 5 mg/kg PO q12h between weeks 3 and 4 (day 24). For each variable, 1-way repeated measures analysis (1-way ANOVA) with post-hoc analysis was performed with statistical significance set at P < .05. RESULTS Dogs had significantly lower platelet counts, evidence of activated platelets, and antiplatelet antibodies during E. canis infection. Dogs also appeared hypercoagulable and hypofibrinolytic using TEG as compared with baseline, changes that persisted for variable amounts of time after doxycycline administration. No overt signs of bleeding were noted during the study. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE Activated platelets and a hypercoagulable, hypofibrinolytic state could explain the lack of a bleeding phenotype in some dogs despite clinically relevant thrombocytopenia.

Case report We report the case of an 18-year-old male patient presenting with a 72-hour history of abdominal pain, fever, erythematous skin rash, vomiting and diarrhoea. Examination showed he also had shock and he was first thought to have oedematous cholecystitis. SARS-CoV-2 infection was also diagnosed. He was admitted to the ICU, and echocardiography showed cardiac dysfunction, with a low ejection fraction and low cardiac index. High-sensitivity troponin serum levels were elevated. The patient received inotropic and vasopressor support. As he fulfilled several criteria for MIS-C/PIMS-TS, he was administered acetylsalicylic acid, corticosteroids and immunoglobulin, with a good clinical response. Conclusion This case emphasizes how this severe presentation of COVID-19 can easily be misdiagnosed if the clinician is less aware of this syndrome in younger patients.

Eligible studies: association between antibiotics and gut microbiome dysbiosis; children 0-18 years; molecular techniques of assessment; outcomes of microbiome richness, diversity or composition. Quality assessed by Newcastle-Ottawa Scale or Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool. Meta-analysis where possible. A total of 4,668 publications identified: 12 in final analysis (5 randomized controlled trials (RCTs), 5 cohort studies, 2 cross-sectional studies). Microbiome richness was measured in 3 studies, species diversity in 6, and species composition in 10. Quality of evidence was good or fair. 5 studies found a significant reduction in diversity and 3 a significant reduction in richness. Macrolide exposure was associated with reduced richness for twice as long as penicillin. Significant reductions were seen in Bifidobacteria (5 studies) and Lactobacillus (2 studies), and significant increases in Proteobacteria such as E. coli (4 studies). A meta-analysis of RCTs of the effect of macrolide (azithromycin) exposure on the gut microbiome found a significant reduction in alpha-diversity (Shannon index: mean difference -0.86 (95% CI -1.59, -0.13).

Methods: The experimental study method was adopted. DPCs from the vibrissa of male C57BL/6J mice aged 5 to 6 weeks and keratinocytes (KCs) from the skin of newborn C57BL/6J mice were obtained by enzyme-digestion method. Stable expression of DPCs markers such as nerve cell adhesion molecules, alkaline phosphatase (ALP), β-catenin, and α-smooth muscle actin were identified by immunofluorescence method in the third passage of the former cells, while the latter primary cells stably expressed keratin 15, a marker of KCs. The 8th passage of DPCs were resuspended with GelMA and inoculated on the bottom surface of the Transwell plate insert, and then the GelMA drops were photocrosslinked and cultured upside down later. The DPCs aggregation in the GelMA drops after culture of 0 (immediately) and 3 day (s) was observed under an optical microscope (the DPCs aggregates were the biomimetic DPSs). Cell viability in biomimetic DPSs cultured for 3 days was detected by live/dead staining kit. The primary DPCs and the 8th passage of DPCs with traditionally two-dimensional culture, and the biomimetic DPSs prepared by the above-mentioned method were set as primary DPCs group, 8th passage of DPCs group, and biomimetic DPSs group, respectively. Transcriptome sequencing was performed of 3 samples in each group after three days of culture using the high-throughput sequencing technology platform. The principal component analysis, Pearson similarity analysis, and differentially expressed genes screening were performed using OmicShare Tools based on the transcriptome data. Cluster analysis of expression patterns of differentially expressed genes was performed using time series trend analysis software. The Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) and Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analyses of differentially expressed genes with specific expression patterns were performed using the OmicShare Tools. The cells were grouped as before, and the sex determining region Y-Box 8 (SOX8), matrix metallopeptidase 9 (MMP-9), collagen type ΧΧⅥ alpha 1 chain (COL26A1), and wingless-type MMTV integration site family member 6 (Wnt6) were screened out from the differentially expressed genes according to the random number table, which were determined by real-time fluorescent quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) to verify the consistency between mRNA expression of differentially expressed genes and sequencing results (n=9); the mRNA expressions of DPCs biological function markers fibroblast growth factor 7 (FGF7), Wnt10a, lymphoid enhancement factor 1 (LEF1), ALP, β-catenin, versican, and SOX2 were determined by real-time fluorescent quantitative RT-PCR (n=9). Three male BALB/c nude mice aged 5-6 weeks were divided into primary DPCs group, 8th passage of DPCs group, and biomimetic DPSs group. The primary DPCs, the 8th passage of DPCs, and the biomimetic DPSs were mixed with primary KCs at a ratio of 2∶1 in cell number and then injected subcutaneously into corresponding groups, with 6 injection regions for each mouse. Two weeks after the injection, the full-thickness skin of the injection region was taken, the regenerated hair was counted, and regenerated hair follicle was observed after hematoxylin-eosin staining. Data were statistically analyzed with one-way analysis of variance, Tukey test, and Bonferroni correction. Results: After 3 days of culture, DPCs aggregated into biomimetic DPSs in GelMA hanging drops from the dispersed state on culture day 0, and the cells in the biomimetic DPSs had good cell activity. After 3 days of culture, principal component analysis showed that compared with that of 8th passage of DPCs group, the variation degree among samples within primary DPCs group and biomimetic DPSs group was relatively close, and the variation degree was the lowest between samples of biomimetic DPSs group and primary DPCs group; the variation degree of gene profile data of more than 90% of DPCs samples in 3 groups could be explained by the first and second principal components. Pearson similarity analysis showed that samples within each group had good repeatability. The similarity between samples of primary DPCs group and biomimetic DPSs group was 0.84-0.95, and the similarity between samples of primary DPCs group and 8th passage of DPCs group was 0.72-0.87. The differentially expressed genes among the three groups were analyzed and 642 differentially expressed genes with group intersection were screened out. Clusters of expression patterns showed that two gene expression patterns showed a significant trend (P<0.05), the first pattern showed that gene expression of 8th passage of DPCs group was significantly lower than that of primary DPCs group or biomimetic DPSs group, and the second pattern showed that gene expression of 8th passage of DPCs group was significantly higher than that of primary DPCs group or biomimetic DPSs group, including a total of 411 differentially expressed genes. KEGG enrichment analysis showed that the 411 differentially expressed genes were significantly enriched in Wnt signaling pathway and phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase/protein kinase B pathway (P<0.05), while GO enrichment analysis showed that GO terms such as extracellular matrix, classical Wnt signaling pathway, and cell differentiation were significantly enriched (P<0.05). The mRNA expressions of SOX8, MMP-9, COL26A1 and Wnt6 in 8th passage of DPCs group were significantly decreased compared with those of primary DPCs group and biomimetic DPSs group (q=15.950, 8.854, 11.890, 11.050, 9.851, 5.884, 7.418, 4.870, P<0.01), consistent with the sequencing data. Compared with those of primary DPCs group and biomimetic DPSs group, the mRNA expressions of FGF7, Wnt10a, LEF1, ALP, β-catenin, versican, and SOX2 in 8th passage of DPCs group were significantly decreased (q=11.470, 9.795, 4.165, 9.242, 10.970, 10.570, 8.005, 7.472, 4.976, 3.651, 4.784, 5.236, 6.825, 5.214, P<0.05 or P<0.01). Two weeks after injection, nude mice in 8th passage of DPCs group failed to regenerate hair, while the numbers of hair regenerated in biomimetic DPSs group and primary DPCs group were close (q=1.852, P>0.05) and both were significantly higher than the number of 8th passage of DPCs group (q=18.980, 17.130, P<0.01). In 8th passage of DPCs group, only necrotic foci were found in the injection region of the skin of nude mice, while regenerated hair follicles were observed in the injection region of both biomimetic DPSs group and primary DPCs group, and melanosis was observed in the cross section of hair follicles. Conclusions: Based on GelMA biomimetic microenvironment and hanging drop method, the biomimetic DPSs culturing model prepared by three dimensional culture of DPCs can restore the hair follicle inducing ability of high passage of DPCs to a certain extent, and its biological characteristics are more similar to those of the primary DPCs, which can restore the characteristics of DPCs.","Huang, G; Chen, L",Zhonghua shao shang za zhi = Zhonghua shaoshang zazhi = Chinese journal of burns,https://doi.org/10.3760/cma.j.cn501120-20210330-00109; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34404159/,402

Methods During the programme, IBD specialists from around the world established by consensus two best practice charters: the 5S Principles and the 5C Concept. Results The 5S Principles were conceived to provide health care providers with key guidance for improving clinical practice based on best management approaches. They comprise the following categories: Stage the disease; Stratify patients; Set treatment goals; Select appropriate treatment; and Supervise therapy. Optimised management of patients with IBD based on the 5S Principles can be achieved most effectively within an optimised clinical care environment. Guidance on optimising the clinical care setting in IBD management is provided through the 5C Concept, which encompasses: Comprehensive IBD care; Collaboration; Communication; Clinical nurse specialists; and Care pathways. Together, the 5C Concept and 5S Principles provide structured recommendations on organising the clinical care setting and developing best-practice approaches in IBD management. Conclusions Consideration and application of these two dimensions could help health care providers optimise their IBD centres and collaborate more effectively with their multidisciplinary team colleagues and patients, to provide improved IBD care in daily clinical practice.

Owing to its critical role in eliciting innate immune responses, IL-1β has been suggested to contribute to various skin diseases, including psoriasis, vitiligo, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), and atopic dermatitis (AD). Recently, several types of activators and inhibitors of different inflammasomes, as well as inflammasome-related genes and genetic susceptibility loci, have been identified in these immune-related common skin diseases. In particular, inflammasome activators and inhibitors presented highly cell-type-specific activity, suggesting that the inflammasome might perform different functions in different cell types. Moreover, most of these findings were based on experimental disease models, and the clinical features of the models partly resemble the typical symptoms of the diseases. In this review, from the perspective of activators and inhibitors, we collected evidence from the widely-studied inflammasomes, NLRP3, AIM2, and NLRP1, in psoriasis, vitiligo, SLE, and AD. Importantly, some small-molecule inhibitors hold therapeutic promise for the treatment of these diseases.","Tang, Lili; Zhou, Fusheng",Frontiers in immunology,https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2020.00882; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32528469/,402

We highlighted the incidence and prevalence, the cognitive pattern in neuropsychological studies, and the relationship between chemotherapy-induced cognitive impairment and different risk factors. We estimated the effect sizes on each cognitive domain and differentiated effect sizes by each method of comparison of effects (i.e., baseline data, or control groups). Methods: The databases MEDLINE and Embase were searched for publications about taxane-related cognitive changes in patients with breast cancer published from 1980 to 2019. Cross-sectional and self-reported outcomes studies were excluded except for the depression item. Included studies were assessed for risk of bias with the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. We estimated effect sizes for each cognitive domain and differentiated effect sizes by each method of comparison of effects. The review is reported in compliance with the PRISMA Statement; it was registered prospectively in PROSPERO as CRD42020163255. Results: Eleven studies meeting the criteria were analyzed, which resulted in a sample of 1,057 patients with breast cancer who received chemotherapy including 820 patients (77%) who received taxane-based chemotherapy. Attention and concentration, depression, and executive function domains had significant chemotherapy-induced impairment across all comparison types. Statistically significant improvement was found in language and verbal memory when comparing chemotherapy patients' test scores with baseline or matched controls. Taxane-based chemotherapy had a non-significant effect on processing speed, visual memory, visuospatial, and motor function domains. Conclusions: The occurrence of chemotherapy-induced cognitive impairment 6 months or more after the course of treatment in people with breast cancer is frequent in the domains of attention, executive function, and depression. Other domains appear stable or improve with time after treatment cessation.","Ibrahim, Eiman Y; Domenicano, Ilaria; Nyhan, Kate; Elfil, Mohamed; Mougalian, Sarah S; Cartmel, Brenda; Ehrlich, Barbara E",Frontiers in oncology,https://doi.org/10.3389/fonc.2021.642382; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33996556/,402

An invitation letter to the survey, which included 35 questions related to hemodynamic monitoring in high-risk surgery, was mailed to every hospital approved by the Japanese Society of Anesthesiologists (JSA) (1260 hospitals). Of the 692 JSA respondents, 573 completed the survey. Despite reporting a high rate of cardiac output (CO) and stroke volume variation (SVV) monitoring in JSA members (70 and 74 %, respectively), fluid goal-directed therapy was poorly implemented in high-risk surgery (7.4 %). Also, 47 % of the JSA respondents did not consistently perform CO optimization. SVV was more commonly used (76 %) as an indicator of volume expansion among JSA respondents, while central venous pressure was less frequently used (48 %). Despite a broader use of advanced hemodynamic monitoring, optimization of CO is still poorly protocolized and applied in Japan. The development of guidelines and protocols for hemodynamic management, including the establishment of strong evidence aimed at improving clinical outcomes, is needed to assist anesthesiologists in more universal adoption of perioperative CO optimization.","Suehiro, Koichi; Tanaka, Katsuaki; Mukai, Akira; Joosten, Alexandre; Desebbe, Olivier; Alexander, Brenton; Cannesson, Maxime; Nishikawa, Kiyonobu",Journal of anesthesia,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00540-016-2155-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26961821/,402

CD9 is upregulated in senescent endothelial cells, neointima hyperplasia, and atherosclerotic plaques. However, its role in cellular senescence and atherosclerosis remains undefined. We investigated the potential mechanism for CD9-mediated cellular senescence and its role in atherosclerotic plaque formation. CD9 knockdown in senescent human umbilical vein endothelial cells significantly rescued senescence phenotypes, while CD9 upregulation in young cells accelerated senescence. CD9 regulated cellular senescence through a phosphatidylinositide 3 kinase-AKT-mTOR-p53 signal pathway. CD9 expression increased in arterial tissues from humans and rats with age, and in atherosclerotic plaques in humans and mice. Anti-mouse CD9 antibody noticeably prevented the formation of atherosclerotic lesions in ApoE-/- mice and Ldlr-/- mice. Furthermore, CD9 ablation in ApoE-/- mice decreased atherosclerotic lesions in aorta and aortic sinus. These results suggest that CD9 plays critical roles in endothelial cell senescence and consequently the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis, implying that CD9 is a novel target for prevention and treatment of vascular aging and atherosclerosis.","Cho, Jung Hee; Kim, Eok-Cheon; Son, Youlim; Lee, Da-Woon; Park, Yong Seop; Choi, Joon Hyuk; Cho, Kyung-Hyun; Kwon, Ki-Sun; Kim, Jae-Ryong",Cell death and differentiation,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41418-020-0537-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32346137/,402

Medical centers have been adapted to provide an efficient arrangement of their economic and human resources. Although neurosurgeons are not in the first line of management and treatment of COVID-19 patients, they take care of patients with neurological pathology and potential severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. Here, the authors describe their institutional actions against the pandemic and compare these actions with those in peer-reviewed publications. METHODS The authors conducted a search using the MEDLINE, PubMed, and Google Scholar databases from the beginning of the pandemic until July 11, 2020, using the following terms: ""Neurosurgery,"" ""COVID-19/SARS-CoV-2,"" ""reconversion/modification,"" ""practice,"" ""academy,"" and ""teaching."" Then, they created operational guidelines tailored for their institution to maximize resource efficiency and minimize risk for the healthcare personnel. RESULTS According to the reviewed literature, the authors defined the following three changes that have had the greatest impact in neurosurgical practice during the COVID-19 pandemic: 1) changes in clinical practices; 2) changes in the medical care setting, including modifications of perioperative care; and 3) changes in the academic teaching methodology. CONCLUSIONS The Instituto Nacional de Neurología y Neurocirugía ""Manuel Velasco Suárez"" is one of the major referral centers for treating highly complex neurosurgical pathologies in Mexico. Its clinical and neurosurgical practices have been modified with the implementation of specific interventions against the spread of COVID-19.

STUDY DESIGN In each case, a wound retractor was used as a working port through a 2.5-cm vertical umbilical incision. The surgical view was secured with the subcutaneous abdominal wall-lift method. Surgical procedures were performed using conventional laparoscopic instruments under vision with a rigid 30°, 5-mm EndoEYE laparoscope. Clinical data regarding patient demographics and surgical outcomes were retrospectively analyzed. RESULTS Between August 2009 and July 2010, one hundred and seventeen tumors from 100 cases were treated with isobaric LESS surgery (unilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, 46; unilateral cystectomy, 33; bilateral cystectomy, 8; bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, 6; unilateral cystectomy and contralateral cyst wall ablation, 4; unilateral cystectomy and contralateral salpingo-oophorectomy, 2; and unilateral salpingectomy, 1). Three normal adnexa were prophylactically resected at the same time as contralateral salpingo-oophorectomy of a diseased ovary. Previous abdominal surgery was noted in 20 cases. Emergency surgery was performed in 7 cases. Six pregnant women were treated in the late first trimester. Median tumor diameter was 6.9 cm. Median surgical duration was 55 min and median blood loss was 10 mL. Conversion to conventional laparoscopic surgery was noted in one case of recurrent endometriotic cyst with severe adhesion. Laparotomic conversion was not experienced. Prolonged administration of antibiotics with extended hospitalization was required in 7 cases due to elevated inflammatory parameters. There were no major surgical complications in this series. The technique yielded excellent cosmetic results with minimum postoperative scar concealed within the umbilicus. With exclusion of 4 endometriotic cysts treated with cyst wall ablation, pathological diagnosis was obtained for 113 tumors (dermoid cyst, 54; endometriotic cyst, 21; serous cystadenoma, 19; mucinous cystadenoma, 9; paraovarian cyst, 8; serous borderline tumor, 1; and paraovarian serous papillary borderline tumor, 1). CONCLUSIONS With efficient wound retraction to create a wide and flexible orifice during instrumentation, the transumbilical wound retraction system combined with the subcutaneous abdominal wall-lift method contributes favorably to LESS surgery as a safe, feasible and reproducible alternative for a variety of ablative and reconstructive applications in the management of adnexal tumors.","Takeda, Akihiro; Imoto, Sanae; Mori, Masahiko; Nakano, Tomoko; Nakamura, Hiromi","European journal of obstetrics, gynecology, and reproductive biology",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejogrb.2011.02.018; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21470765/,402

Compared with the results in the primary strain, the variants showed no statistically significant differences. We next established a Balb/c mouse pseudovirus infection model for detecting neutralizing antibodies against pseudovirus. Five immunizations with pseudoviral DNA protected the mice from infection with the pseudovirus. Bioluminescence imaging, which we used to evaluate viral dissemination and distribution in the mice, showed a good relationship between the neutralizing antibodies titers in vitro.

METHODS CsA self-emulsifying drug delivery systems (SEDDS) were encapsulated into SmPill® minispheres. Varying degrees of coating thickness (low, medium and high) were applied using ethylcellulose and pectin (E:P) polymers. In vitro CsA release was evaluated in simulated gastric and intestinal media. Bioavailability of CsA in vivo following oral administration to pigs of SmPill® minispheres was compared to Neoral® po and Sandimmun® iv in a pig model. CsA concentrations in blood and intestinal tissue were determined by HPLC-UV. RESULTS In vitro CsA release from coated minispheres decreased with increasing coating thickness. A linear relationship was observed between in vitro CsA release and in vivo bioavailability (r(2) = 0.98). CsA concentrations in the proximal, transverse and distal colon were significantly higher following administration of SmPill®, compared to Neoral® po and Sandimmun® iv (p < 0.05). Analysis of transverse colon tissue subsections also revealed significantly higher CsA concentrations in the mucosa and submucosa using SmPill® minispheres (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS Modulating E:P coating thickness controls release of CsA from SmPill® minispheres. Coated minispheres limited CsA release in the small intestine and enhanced delivery and uptake in the colon.

METHODS MEDLINE, CINAHL Plus with Full Text, PsycINFO, PsycARTICLES, Psychology and Behavioral Sciences Collection, Education Full Text, and ERIC were systematically searched for studies published in English between January 1, 2006 and May 30, 2016. A total of 4117 titles were identified; of which, 31 studies were included (21 qualitative studies, 9 quantitative studies, and 1 mixed-methods study). The methodological quality of the studies was appraised by using different tools. RESULTS Most studies focused on screening for prostate (n = 18) and colorectal cancer (n = 7). Most men were passive information-gatherers rather than active information-seekers. Key sources of information included the Internet for active information-seekers and health care professionals for passive information-gatherers. Barriers to information-seeking included information overload, embarrassment, and fear. Low literacy and health literacy levels were addressed in 3 studies and were identified as impediments to active information-seeking. Facilitators to information-seeking included family support, media, celebrity endorsements, and targeted information.

AAAs rapidly expanded capacity and dramatically modified program offerings, communications activities, and service delivery protocols to address emergent needs and minimize COVID-19 exposure risk for clients. AAAs' trusted relationships with older adults and community partners improved their capacity to identify priority needs and coordinate appropriate supports. Policymakers should ensure that AAAs receive sustained financial and technical support to ensure critical community-based services are available for older adults throughout pandemic response and recovery.","Pendergrast, Claire",Journal of applied gerontology : the official journal of the Southern Gerontological Society,https://doi.org/10.1177/0733464821991026; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33541195/,402
102905,Major bleeding risk and mortality associated with antiplatelet drugs in real-world clinical practice. A prospective cohort study.,2020,"Introduction: In the absence of effective antivirals and vaccination, the pandemic of COVID-19 remains the most significant challenge to our health care system in decades. There is an urgent need for definitive therapeutic intervention. Clinical reports indicate that the cytokine storm associated with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is the leading cause of mortality in severe cases of some respiratory viral infections, including COVID-19. In recent years, cannabinoids have been investigated extensively due to their potential effects on the human body. Among all cannabinoids, cannabidiol (CBD) has demonstrated potent anti-inflammatory effects in a variety of pathological conditions. Therefore, it is logical to explore whether CBD can reduce the cytokine storm and treat ARDS. Materials and Methods: In this study, we show that intranasal application of Poly(I:C), a synthetic analogue of viral double-stranded RNA, simulated symptoms of severe viral infections inducing signs of ARDS and cytokine storm. Discussion: The administration of CBD downregulated the level of proinflammatory cytokines and ameliorated the clinical symptoms of Poly I:C-induced ARDS. Conclusion: Our results suggest a potential protective role for CBD during ARDS that may extend CBD as part of the treatment of COVID-19 by reducing the cytokine storm, protecting pulmonary tissues, and re-establishing inflammatory homeostasis.","Khodadadi, Hesam; Salles, Évila Lopes; Jarrahi, Abbas; Chibane, Fairouz; Costigliola, Vincenzo; Yu, Jack C; Vaibhav, Kumar; Hess, David C; Dhandapani, Krishnan M; Baban, Babak",Cannabis and cannabinoid research,https://doi.org/10.1089/can.2020.0043; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32923657/,402

Under these unique circumstances, urologists continue to provide essential healthcare services and support healthcare systems, by participating in the treatment of COVID-19(+) patients and sparing vital equipment and hospital beds. However, delivering medical care during the pandemic requires strategic planning for all surgical and outpatient activities. Proposed measures include rescheduling elective non-oncological surgeries and using a prioritization protocol for oncological surgeries according to hospital capacity. Following that, outpatient clinics could be partly replaced by telemedicine. Additionally, urologists should be trained in screening and treating patients with COVID-19 during their daily routine. In order to efficiently provide their services, a management protocol for suspected or known COVID-19 urological patients should be implemented. Furthermore, preventive measures for the nosocomial dispersion of the virus and training on self-protective equipment is mandatory for all physicians. Finally, organizational planning for the best utilization of the staff is of utmost importance. Implementation and adaptation of the protocols according to local requirements and guidelines will ameliorate the quality of services and population's health status. Finally, enhancement of current practices will prepare health systems for future crisis.","Papaefstathiou, Efstathios; Apostolopoulou, Aikaterini; Papaefstathiou, Eirini; Moysidis, Kyriakos; Hatzimouratidis, Konstantinos; Sarafis, Pavlos",Urology journal,https://doi.org/10.22037/uj.v16i7.6278; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32869251/,402

The responses of zooplankton (counted by abundance and the activity and immuno-reactive content of free N-Acetyl-β-D-glucosaminidase (NAGase)), phytoplankton (counted by chlorophyll and phycocyanin), planktonic bacteria and fungi, and some water quality parameters were investigated in a period of 35 d. Results of the study showed that the ostracoda was more sensitive than daphnid, with time-weighted average (TWA)-based no observed effect concentrations (NOECs) to be 8.45 and 12.66 μg/L in systems without humic acid addition (HA-) and to be 6.37 and 9.54 μg/L in systems with humic acid addition (HA+). The duration of treatment-related effects in the ostracoda population was longer than the daphnid population (21 vs. 14 days). Besides, the data analysis indicated that the toxicity of fenoxycarb was significantly enhanced in the HA+ systems. Owing to the reduced grazing pressure, the concentrations of chlorophyll and phycocyanin increased in the two highest treatments. The increase in photosynthesis along with a reduced animal excretion led to an increase in pH and a decrease in nutrient contents. These changes seemed to have an effect on the microbial communities. For example, the abundances of some opportunistic pathogens of aquatic animals (e.g. Aeromonas and Cladosporium) and organic-pollutant-degrading microorganisms (e.g. Ancylobacter and Azospirillum) increased significantly in microbial communities, but the abundances of Pedobacter, Candidatus Planktoluna, and Rhodobacter (photosynthetic bacteria) markedly decreased. This study provides useful information to understand the ecotoxicological impacts of fenoxycarb at the population and community levels while integrating the effects of HA on toxicity.","Lu, Yu; Li, Shaonan; Sha, Meng; Wang, Biao; Cheng, Gong; Guo, Yirong; Zhu, Jinwen",Ecotoxicology and environmental safety,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoenv.2020.111022; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32888608/,402

The PD is partly related to temperature and study duration, but other factors that contribute to errant pressure recording have not been systematically evaluated. The aim of this study was to investigate and quantify contributing factors to pressure recording error. METHODS In total, 660 in vitro experiments were conducted on seven HRM catheters to determine the effects of sustained pressure exposure, catheter impingement, temperature, duration of study, and immersion in saline or acid on recorded pressure and PD. KEY RESULTS At room temperature and without application of pressure, the PD was negligible. Application of sustained pressure significantly increased PD and catheter impingement of even 15° produced remarkable increases in the recorded pressure as well as post-recording PD. There was significant variability across sensors in their propensity to develop PD with temperature. Body (37°C) and freezing (0°C) temperatures resulted in significantly higher absolute value of PD in the opposite algebraic direction, respectively (for individual sensors). Although the overall trend was for higher PD with increasing temperature, some of the pressure sensors demonstrated inherently negative PD at body temperature. CONCLUSIONS AND INFERENCES In addition to the known effects of temperature, both sustained pressure exposure and catheter impingement significantly affect the recorded pressure and the magnitude of the PD observed at the end of the recording. These effects can be substantial enough to result in erroneous manometric diagnoses.","Babaei, A; Szabo, A; Yorio, S D; Massey, B T",Neurogastroenterology and motility : the official journal of the European Gastrointestinal Motility Society,https://doi.org/10.1111/nmo.13329; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29520927/,402

It is assumed that avians exhibit a similar response, but to date, there have been no controlled studies to correlate serial endogenous corticosterone levels to hematologic values. An established flock of 18 Hispaniolan Amazon parrots ( Amazona ventralis) was used as a model in a crossover study. The treatment group was subjected to the stress of transport, restraint, and common clinical procedures with serial blood samples collected at 20-min intervals for hematology and corticosterone levels; the control group was sampled at the same intervals. Longitudinal data analysis was performed with linear mixed modeling. For all hematologic analytes, the baseline value had a significant positive effect on subsequent values (all P < 0.001). The white blood cell, heterophil, and eosinophil counts and heterophil to lymphocyte ratio increased over time in the treatment group, whereas it remained stable in the control group ( P = 0.016, P < 0.001, P < 0.001, P = 0.02, respectively, for the time*treatment effect). Lymphocyte absolute counts decreased over time, although not significantly; the decrease was significant for the relative lymphocyte count in the treatment group. Monocytes and basophils were not significantly altered. The treatment group had a higher mean corticosterone level overall than the control group by approximately 60% ( P = 0.008). The mean corticosterone level also increased over time in both groups by three- to fourfold ( P < 0.001) by 20 min then plateaued. These results demonstrate that some significant hematologic changes may arise with routine handling and transportation of birds and should be accounted for in hematologic interpretation of cell counts.","McRee, Anna Elizabeth; Tully, Thomas N; Nevarez, Javier G; Beaufrere, Hugues; Ammersbach, Melanie; Gaunt, Stephen D; Fuller, Rory G; Romero, L Michael",Journal of zoo and wildlife medicine : official publication of the American Association of Zoo Veterinarians,https://doi.org/10.1638/2016-0100.1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29900764/,402

METHODS An electronic search was conducted of PubMed, Embase and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials for articles published from 2010 to 2020 in the English language. From the initial search, 404 full-text studies were assessed for eligibility. After excluding studies for technical and study limitations, a total of 67 studies were included in the summary tables and additional studies were included in the review to support evidence. RESULTS Few systemic disease and conditions were found to be clinically meaningfully associated with caries experience. Best evidence from human and animal studies described association between metabolic diseases and dental caries. Several interesting animal studies were noted that could generate clinical hypotheses and further investigations in rodent models for cardiovascular injury and hyperglycemia. Inadequate data was found to suggest any modifications to current clinical practice or prevention guidelines. CONCLUSIONS Limited clinical evidence was found connecting several systemic diseases and dental caries.

The typical ILMs to illustrate spatial data are based on the distance between susceptible and infectious individuals. A key feature of GD-ILMs is that they take into account the spatial location of the individuals in addition to the distance between susceptible and infectious individuals. As a motivation of this article, we consider tuberculosis (TB) data which is an infectious disease which can be transmitted through individuals. It is also known that certain areas/demographics/communities have higher prevalent of TB (see Section 4 for more details). It is also of interest of policy makers to identify those areas with higher infectivity rate of TB for possible preventions. Therefore, we need to analyze this data properly to address those concerns. In this article, the expectation conditional maximization algorithm is proposed for estimating the parameters of GD-ILMs to be able to predict the areas with the highest average infectivity rates of TB. We also evaluate the performance of our proposed approach through some simulations. Our simulation results indicate that the proposed method provides reliable estimates of parameters which confirms accuracy of the infectivity rates.","Amiri, Leila; Torabi, Mahmoud; Deardon, Rob; Pickles, Michael",Statistics in medicine,https://doi.org/10.1002/sim.8863; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33469942/,402
113940,Cannula malposition during antegrade cerebral perfusion for aortic surgery: role of cerebral oximetry.,2014,"STUDY QUESTION How are progesterone (P4)-induced repetitive intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) signals (oscillations) in human sperm generated? SUMMARY ANSWER P4-induced [Ca2+]i oscillations are generated in the flagellum by membrane potential (Vm)-sensitive Ca2+-influx through CatSper channels. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY A subset of human sperm display [Ca2+]i oscillations that regulate flagellar beating and acrosome reaction. Although pharmacological manipulations indicate involvement of stored Ca2+ in these oscillations, influx of extracellular Ca2+ is also required. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION This was a laboratory study that used >20 sperm donors and involved more than 100 separate experiments and analysis of more than 1000 individual cells over a period of 2 years. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS Semen donors and patients were recruited in accordance with local ethics approval from Birmingham University and Tayside ethics committees. [Ca2+]i responses and Vm of individual cells were examined by fluorescence imaging and whole-cell current clamp. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE P4-induced [Ca2+]i oscillations originated in the flagellum, spreading to the neck and head (latency of 1-2 s). K+-ionophore valinomycin (1 µM) was used to investigate the role of membrane potential (Vm). Direct assessment by whole-cell current-clamp confirmed that Vm in valinomycin-exposed cells was determined primarily by K+ equilibrium potential (EK) and was rapidly 'reset' upon manipulation of [K+]o. Pre-treatment of sperm with valinomycin ([K+]o = 5.4 mM) had no effect on the P4-induced [Ca2+] transient (P = 0.95; eight experiments), but application of valinomycin to P4-pretreated sperm suppressed activity in 82% of oscillating cells (n = 257; P = 5 × 10-55 compared to control) and significantly reduced both the amplitude and frequency of persisting oscillations (P = 0.0001). Upon valinomycin washout, oscillations re-started in most cells. When valinomycin was applied in saline with elevated [K+], the inhibitory effect of valinomycin was reduced and was dependent on EK (P = 10-25). Amplitude and frequency of [Ca2+]i oscillations that persisted in the presence of valinomycin showed similar sensitivity to EK (P < 0.01). The CatSper inhibitor RU1968 (4.8 and 11 µM) caused immediate and reversible arrest of activity in 36% and 96% of oscillating cells, respectively (P < 10-10). Quinidine (300 µM) which blocks the sperm K+ current (IKsper) completely, inhibited [Ca2+]i oscillations. LARGE SCALE DATA N/A. LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION This was an in-vitro study and caution must be taken when extrapolating these results to in-vivo regulation of sperm. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS [Ca2+]i oscillations in human sperm are functionally important and their absence is associated with failed fertilisation at IVF. The data reported here provide new understanding of the mechanisms that underlie the regulation and generation (or failure) of these oscillations.

Development of a standardised set of outcomes would resolve these issues. This study provides the definitive core outcome set (COS) for fistulising pCD. DESIGN Candidate outcomes were generated through a systematic review and patient interviews. Consensus was established via a three-round Delphi process using a 9-point Likert scale based on how important they felt it was in determining treatment success culminating in a final consensus meeting. Stakeholders were recruited nationally and grouped into three panels (surgeons and radiologists, gastroenterologists and IBD specialist nurses, and patients). Participants received feedback from their panel (in the second round) and all participants (in the third round) to allow refinement of their scores. RESULTS A total of 295 outcomes were identified from systematic reviews and interviews that were categorised into 92 domains. 187 stakeholders (response rate 78.5%) prioritised 49 outcomes through a three-round Delphi study. The final consensus meeting of 41 experts and patients generated agreement on an eight domain COS. The COS comprised three patient-reported outcome domains (quality of life, incontinence and a combined score of patient priorities) and five clinician-reported outcome domains (perianal disease activity, development of new perianal abscess/sepsis, new/recurrent fistula, unplanned surgery and faecal diversion). CONCLUSION A fistulising pCD COS has been produced by all key stakeholders. Application of the COS will reduce heterogeneity in outcome reporting, thereby facilitating more meaningful comparisons between treatments, data synthesis and ultimately benefit patient care.","Sahnan, Kapil; Tozer, Phil J; Adegbola, Samuel O; Lee, Matthew J; Heywood, Nick; McNair, Angus G K; Hind, Daniel; Yassin, Nuha; Lobo, Alan J; Brown, Steven R; Sebastian, Shaji; Phillips, Robin K S; Lung, Phillip F C; Faiz, Omar D; Crook, Kay; Blackwell, Sue; Verjee, Azmina; Hart, Ailsa L; Fearnhead, Nicola S",Gut,https://doi.org/10.1136/gutjnl-2017-315503; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29437911/,402

Although a recent report indicated favorable responses to the interleukin-1 receptor antagonist, anakinra in eight patients with COVID-19 secondary HLH diagnosed using the HScore calculation, others have suggested that the diagnosis of secondary HLH is uncommon and that the use of the HScore has limited value in guiding immunomodulatory therapy for COVID-19. Here, we provide additional perspective on this important controversy based upon comparisons between 14 COVID-19 cytokine storm patients and 10 secondary HLH patients seen immediately prior to the pandemic. We hypothesize that identification of HLH may relate to the severity or timing of cytokine release and suggest distinguishing between cytokine release syndrome and secondary HLH, reserving the latter term for cases fulfilling diagnostic criteria.","Hakim, Nausheen N; Chi, Jeffrey; Olazagasti, Coral; Liu, Johnson M",Experimental biology and medicine,https://doi.org/10.1177/1535370220962043; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32972235/,402

When placed in solid-state electronic junctions, MHCs support temperature-independent currents over several nanometers that are 3 orders of magnitude higher compared to other redox proteins of similar size. To gain molecular-level insight into their astonishingly high conductivities, we combine experimental photoemission spectroscopy with DFT+Σ current-voltage calculations on a representative Gold-MHC-Gold junction. We find that conduction across the dry, 3 nm long protein occurs via off-resonant coherent tunneling, mediated by a large number of protein valence-band orbitals that are strongly delocalized over heme and protein residues. This picture is profoundly different from the electron hopping mechanism induced electrochemically or photochemically under aqueous conditions. Our results imply that the current output in solid-state junctions can be even further increased in resonance, for example, by applying a gate voltage, thus allowing a quantum jump for next-generation bionanoelectronic devices.","Futera, Zdenek; Ide, Ichiro; Kayser, Ben; Garg, Kavita; Jiang, Xiuyun; van Wonderen, Jessica H; Butt, Julea N; Ishii, Hisao; Pecht, Israel; Sheves, Mordechai; Cahen, David; Blumberger, Jochen",The journal of physical chemistry letters,https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpclett.0c02686; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33142062/,402

Palliative care may lower costs for hospitalized adults, but the evidence has important limitations. Objective To estimate the association of palliative care consultation (PCC) with direct hospital costs for adults with serious illness. Data Sources Systematic searches of the Embase, PsycINFO, CENTRAL, PubMed, CINAHL, and EconLit databases were performed for English-language journal articles using keywords in the domains of palliative care (eg, palliative, terminal) and economics (eg, cost, utilization), with limiters for hospital and consultation. For Embase, PsycINFO, and CENTRAL, we searched without a time limitation. For PubMed, CINAHL, and EconLit, we searched for articles published after August 1, 2013. Data analysis was performed from April 8, 2017, to September 16, 2017.

When patients were pooled irrespective of diagnosis, there was a statistically significant reduction in costs (-$3237; 95% CI, -$3581 to -$2893; P < .001). In the stratified analyses, there was a reduction in costs for the cancer (-$4251; 95% CI, -$4664 to -$3837; P < .001) and noncancer (-$2105; 95% CI, -$2698 to -$1511; P < .001) subsamples. The reduction in cost was greater in those with 4 or more comorbidities than for those with 2 or fewer. Conclusions and Relevance The estimated association of early hospital PCC with hospital costs may vary according to baseline clinical factors. Estimates may be larger for primary diagnosis of cancer and more comorbidities compared with primary diagnosis of noncancer and fewer comorbidities. Increasing palliative care capacity to meet national guidelines may reduce costs for hospitalized adults with serious and complex illnesses.","May, Peter; Normand, Charles; Cassel, J Brian; Del Fabbro, Egidio; Fine, Robert L; Menz, Reagan; Morrison, Corey A; Penrod, Joan D; Robinson, Chessie; Morrison, R Sean",JAMA internal medicine,https://doi.org/10.1001/jamainternmed.2018.0750; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29710177/,402
119077,2016 AHA/ACC Guideline on the Management of Patients With Lower Extremity Peripheral Artery Disease: Executive Summary: A Report of the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association Task Force on Clinical Practice Guidelines.,2017,"BACKGROUND In recent years it has become clear that fetal anomalies can already be detected at the end of the first trimester of pregnancy by two-dimensional (2D) ultrasound. This is why increasingly in developed countries the first trimester anomaly scan is being offered as part of standard care. We have developed a Virtual Reality (VR) approach to improve the diagnostic abilities of 2D ultrasound. Three-dimensional (3D) ultrasound datasets are used in VR assessment, enabling real depth perception and unique interaction. The aim of this study is to investigate whether first trimester 3D VR ultrasound is of additional value in terms of diagnostic accuracy for the detection of fetal anomalies. Health-related quality of life, cost-effectiveness and also the perspective of both patient and ultrasonographer on the 3D VR modality will be studied. METHODS Women in the first trimester of a high risk pregnancy for a fetus with a congenital anomaly are eligible for inclusion. This is a randomized controlled trial with two intervention arms. The control group receives 'care as usual': a second trimester 2D advanced ultrasound examination. The intervention group will undergo an additional first trimester 2D and 3D VR ultrasound examination. Following each examination participants will fill in validated questionnaires evaluating their quality of life and healthcare related expenses. Participants' and ultrasonographers' perspectives on the 3D VR ultrasound will be surveyed. The primary outcome will be the detection of fetal anomalies. The additional first trimester 3D VR ultrasound examination will be compared to 'care as usual'. Neonatal or histopathological examinations are considered the gold standard for the detection of congenital anomalies. To reach statistical significance and 80% power with a detection rate of 65% for second trimester ultrasound examination and 70% for the combined detection of first trimester 3D VR and second trimester ultrasound examination, a sample size of 2800 participants is needed. DISCUSSION First trimester 3D VR detection of fetal anomalies may improve patients' quality of life through reassurance or earlier identification of malformations. Results of this study will provide policymakers and healthcare professionals with the highest level of evidence for cost-effectiveness of first trimester ultrasound using a 3D VR approach.

119319,"Editorial Comment on ""Multi-Center Study of Temporal Changes and Prognostic Value of a CT Visual Severity Score in Hospitalized Patients with COVID-19"".",2020-09-16,"OBJECTIVES The burden of stress experienced by dentistry students has been the subject of numerous studies aimed at defining the strongest stressors, and at reducing their intensity to improve the conditions and, consequently, the quality of education. Such studies have never been performed in the conditions of a pandemic caused by a new, unknown coronavirus. Therefore, the objective of the study was to identify the sources of their stress in the course of the studies, with reference to the COVID‑19 pandemic. MATERIAL AND METHODS A total of 334 dentistry students of the Institute of Dentistry at the Jagiellonian University Medical College were invited to take part in the study. They represented a range from the first to the fifth year of studies in the 2019/2020 academic year. The tool employed in the study was the Dental Environmental Stress (DES) questionnaire and 11 supplementary questions related to the pandemic. The study was carried out on June 1-25, 2020. RESULTS The participation rate was 72%. Academic work presented the highest level of stress. A comparison of the overall levels of stress in particular domains as well as questions included in the DES survey revealed significant differences between students of individual years of studies in the 2019/2020 academic year. The strongest positive relationships between the supplementary questions and the DES domains appeared in the area of clinical factors. These concerned returning to clinical classes and contact with patients with regard to SARS-CoV-2 (rs = 0.50, p < 0.001), contact with patients in connection with SARS-CoV-2 (rs = 0.47, p < 0.001), and a lack of practical classes with patients in connection with the COVID‑19 pandemic (rs = 0.42, p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS Dentistry students were subjected to stress resulting from a conflict between the perceived risk of returning to clinical classes and contact with patients due to SARS-CoV-2, and disruptions in the course of clinical education, which they perceived negatively.","Zarzecka, Joanna; Zarzecka-Francica, Elżbieta; Gala, Andrzej; Gębczyński, Krzysztof; Pihut, Małgorzata",International journal of occupational medicine and environmental health,https://doi.org/10.13075/ijomeh.1896.01773; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33734215/,402
119411,When to do surgery and when not to do surgery for endometriosis: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,2019,"INTRODUCTION In order to propose risk-adapted mobilization algorithms, several authors have tried to look for predictive factors of the CD34+ yield in healthy pediatric donors. Donor recipient body weight ratio (D/R ratio) was identified as one of the main variables related with the success to achieve the target cell dose for transplantation. According to this variable we modified the mobilization schedule. MATERIAL AND METHODS We report the results of 46 mobilizations and apheresis procedures performed in our center with unfavorable D/R ratio. Mobilization was attempted by the standard regime of G-CSF (10 mcg/kg/24 hours) in 28 cases (60.9%), with high dose G-CSF (10 mcg/kg/12 hours) in 9 cases (19.6%), and with plerixafor and G-CSF single dose regime in 9 cases (19.6%). RESULTS CD34+ cell quantification before apheresis is closely related to CD34+ yield, being the only factor related to collected CD34+ cells (beta .71; P < .0001). The mobilization efficiency was higher in plerixafor group compared to the other two schedules (P < .0001). By using plerixafor for mobilization, we achieved the target CD34+ cell dose of ≥2 × 106 /kg per recipient body weight in all cases with unfavorable D/R ratio. It was observed that 17.4% of cases that not reached the established target cell dose were located in the standard or high-dose mobilization regimes. This difference is even greater for optimal collections (≥5 × 106 /kg), since of the 54.3% cases that did not reach this goal none was mobilized by plerixafor. CONCLUSION Tailoring the mobilization regime we can reach the target cell dose, even in those cases with the worst D/R ratio.","Zubicaray, Josune; Galvez, Eva; Sebastian, Elena; Molina, Blanca; González-Vicent, Marta; Castillo, Ana; Ramírez, Manuel; Madero, Luis; Díaz, Miguel Angel; Sevilla, Julian",Journal of clinical apheresis,https://doi.org/10.1002/jca.21844; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33079424/,402

This aspiration has translated into a multitude of teaching programmes of variable scope and quality, reflecting a lack of consensus on the skills and practices required for rigorous HPSR. The purpose of this paper is to identify an agreed set of core competencies for HPSR researchers, building on the previous work by the Health Systems Global (HSG) Thematic Working Group on Teaching & Learning. METHODS Our methods involved an iterative approach of four phases including a literature review, key informant interviews and group discussions with HPSR educators, and webinars with pre-post surveys capturing views among the global HPSR community. The phased discussions and consensus-building contributed to the evolution of the HPSR competency domains and competencies framework. RESULTS Emerging domains included understanding health systems complexity, assessing policies and programs, appraising data and evidence, ethical reasoning and practice, leading and mentoring, building partnerships, and translating and utilizing knowledge and HPSR evidence. The development of competencies and their application were often seen as a continuous process spanning evidence generation, partnering, communicating and helping to identify new critical health systems questions. CONCLUSION The HPSR competency set can be seen as a useful reference point in the teaching and practice of high-quality HPSR and can be adapted based on national priorities, the particularities of local contexts, and the needs of stakeholders (HPSR researchers and educators), as well as practitioners and policy-makers. Further research is needed in using the core competency set to design national training programmes, develop locally relevant benchmarks and assessment methods, and evaluate their use in different settings.","Schleiff, Meike J; Rangnekar, Avanti; Oviedo Gomez, Francisco; Teddy, Gina; Peters, David H; Balabanova, Dina",International journal of health policy and management,https://doi.org/10.34172/ijhpm.2020.258; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33590742/,402

Despite the several bedsides- to- bench investigations carried out by researchers all over the world to identify the best prophylactic and therapeutic options for this deadly virus, no novel vaccine or treatment drug has been developed. Accumulating evidence suggests that severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS -CoV2) is associated with hyper inflammation characterized by excessive release of pro-inflammatory cytokines known as a cytokine storm. The hallmark of this unregulated inflammatory response includes viral sepsis, pneumonitis shock, coagulopathy, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) which is the major cause of death in COVID-19 patients. In the midst of cytokine storm and coagulopathy, anti-viral agents alone will not provide the much needed therapeutic effect. Hence, the need to combine anti-inflammatory agents such as interferons, angiotensinogen converting enzyme (ACE) 2 inhibitors, interleukin- 6 (IL-6), and Janus kinase (JAK) family inhibitors, anticoagulants and other agents involved in inflammation resolution. This review critically presented a comprehensive overview of SAR-CoV2, unveiled the mechanisms of the inflammatory response in SARS-CoV2 and also highlighted possible specific prophylactic and therapeutic interventions that will circumvent inflammatory induced deaths in COVID -19 patients.

It has become a major cause of concern for health care professionals all over the world. Objective The aim of this study was to assess knowledge, awareness and hygiene practices regarding COVID-19 among private dental practitioners practicing in Tricity (Chandigarh, Panchkula and Mohali) in India during these critical times. Materials and Methods A total of 245 private dentists participated in this cross-sectional survey and finally 215 constituted the final sample size. A self-administered, multiple choice type questionnaire (verified by a specialist) was administered to obtain information from the subjects. The questionnaire was divided into two parts and included 15 questions on knowledge and awareness regarding COVID-19. Statistical analysis was done using ANOVA and Student’s t-test. Results Percentage of subjects who answered correctly regarding main symptoms of COVID-19 and primary mode of transmission was 87% and 82.5% respectively. One-third of the subjects were not aware regarding Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) to be used while rendering dental treatment. 75% of subjects were of the opinion that supportive care is the current treatment regime for COVID-19. Less than one-third of subjects (30.2%) reported high scores. Education level (p=0.018) and health sector profile (p=0.024) of the subjects were significantly associated with mean knowledge scores. Conclusion The findings of the present study showed that some notable deficiencies in knowledge existed among dental professionals regarding some vital aspects of COVID-19. Therefore, there is an urgent need for improving dentists’knowledge via health education and training programs. Further studies on the subject are also warranted once the situation normalizes.","Singh Gambhir, Ramandeep; Singh Dhaliwal, Jagjit; Aggarwal, Amit; Anand, Samir; Anand, Vaibhav; Kaur Bhangu, Amanpreet",Roczniki Panstwowego Zakladu Higieny,https://doi.org/10.32394/rpzh.2020.0115; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32519827/,402

However, access to the brain requires invasive procedures, such as the removal of a portion of the skull or the drilling of a burr hole. Also, electrode implantation into tissue can cause inflammatory tissue responses and brain trauma, and lead to device failure. Here, we report the development and application of a chronically implanted platinum electrode array mounted on a nitinol endovascular stent for the localized stimulation of cortical tissue from within a blood vessel. Following percutaneous angiographic implantation of the device in sheep, we observed stimulation-induced responses of the facial muscles and limbs of the animals, similar to those evoked by electrodes implanted via invasive surgery. Proximity of the electrode to the motor cortex, yet not its orientation, was integral to achieving reliable responses from discrete neuronal populations. The minimally invasive endovascular surgical approach offered by the stent-mounted electrode array might enable safe and efficacious stimulation of focal regions in the brain.","Opie, Nicholas L; John, Sam E; Rind, Gil S; Ronayne, Stephen M; Wong, Yan T; Gerboni, Giulia; Yoo, Peter E; Lovell, Timothy J H; Scordas, Theodore C M; Wilson, Stefan L; Dornom, Anthony; Vale, Thomas; O'Brien, Terence J; Grayden, David B; May, Clive N; Oxley, Thomas J",Nature biomedical engineering,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41551-018-0321-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31015727/,402

Health Canada defines side effect as a harmful and unintended response to a health product. Given drug safety concerns, this study's purpose was to review the unintended side effects of cannabis in otolaryngology. METHODS The Preferred Reporting Items For Systematic Reviews and Meta-analysis extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR) protocol was used to conduct a scoping review of the MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, and CENTRAL databases. (PROSPERO: CRD42020153022). English studies in adults were included from inception to the end of 2019. In-vitro, animal, and studies with n < 5 were excluded. Primary outcome was defined as unintended side effects (defined as any Otolaryngology symptom or diagnosis) following cannabis use. Oxford Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine: Levels of Evidence and risk of bias using the Risk of Bias in randomized trials (RoB 2) and Risk of Bias in Non-Randomized Studies of Interventions (ROBINS-I) tools were assessed.. Two authors independently reviewed all studies; the senior author settled any discrepancies. RESULTS Five hundred and twenty-one studies were screened; 48 studies were analysed. Subspecialties comprised: Head and Neck (32), Otology (8), Rhinology (5), Airway (5), Laryngology (1). Cannabis use was associated with unintended tinnitus, vertigo, hearing loss, infection, malignancy, sinusitis, allergic rhinitis, thyroid dysfunction, and dyspnea. About half (54.1%) of studies showed increased side effects, or no change in symptoms following cannabis use. Oxford Levels of Evidence was 2-4 with substantial heterogeneity. Risk of bias assessment with RoB2 was low to high and ROBINS-1 was moderate to critical. CONCLUSION This was the first comprehensive scoping review of unintended side effects of cannabis in Otolaryngology. The current literature is limited and lacks high-quality research Future randomized studies are needed to focus on therapeutic effects of cannabis in otolaryngology.

The sample was composed of an approximately even split of male (51.2%) and female (48.8%) participants who ranged in age from 18 to 60 years. The PMHSS is a 21-item measure that was designed to assess the impact of specific medical stressors that military healthcare providers may encounter while deployed. An exploratory factor analysis of the PMHSS revealed the presence of two distinct factors: trainable and futility stressors. Confirmatory factor analysis showed that a bifactor model best represented the data, with all items loading higher on the general factor relative to their specific subscale factors. Evidence of partial scalar invariance by gender was found. The PMHSS was significantly correlated with several convergent measures, including assessments of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression severity, distress due to both combat exposure and general deployment-related concerns, and positive affect, rs = .30-.59. PMHSS scores were more strongly correlated with PTSD and depression in women than in men, and they provided incremental validity in predicting convergent measures over and above other related constructs. Healthcare-specific stressors are an understudied area, and this study provides new insights into how deployment-related caregiving stress may impact deployed military medical personnel independently of the impact of combat experiences.","Hale, Willie J; Moore, Brian A; Straud, Casey L; Baker, Monty T; Peterson, Alan L",Journal of traumatic stress,https://doi.org/10.1002/jts.22606; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33084109/,402

AIMS We aimed to investigate whether patients with different types of stroke admitted during weekends have a higher risk of in-hospital mortality in rural and urban hospitals in the US. METHODS We used data from the 2016 National Inpatient Sample and used logistic regression to assess in-hospital mortality for weekday and weekend admissions among stroke patients aged 18 and older by stroke type (ischemic or hemorrhagic) and rural or urban status. RESULTS Crude stroke mortality was higher in weekend admissions (p <0.001). After adjusting for confounding variables, in-hospital mortality among hemorrhagic stroke patients was significantly greater (22.0%) for weekend admissions compared to weekday admissions (20.2%, p = 0.009). Among rural hospitals, the in-hospital mortality among hemorrhagic stroke patients was also greater among weekend admissions (36.9%) compared to weekday admissions (25.7%, p = 0.040). Among urban hospitals, the mortality of hemorrhagic stroke patients was 21.1% for weekend and 19.6% for weekday admissions (p = 0.026). No weekend effect was found among ischemic stroke patients admitted to rural or urban hospitals. CONCLUSIONS Our results help to understand mortality differences in hemorrhagic stroke for weekend vs. weekday admissions in urban and rural hospitals. Factors such as density of care providers, stroke centers, and patient level risky behaviors associated with the weekend effect on hemorrhagic stroke mortality need further investigation to improve stroke care services and reduce weekend effect on hemorrhagic stroke mortality.","Mekonnen, Birook; Wang, Guijing; Rajbhandari-Thapa, Janani; Shi, Lu; Thapa, Kiran; Zhang, Zheng; Zhang, Donglan",Journal of stroke and cerebrovascular diseases : the official journal of National Stroke Association,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jstrokecerebrovasdis.2020.105106; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32912515/,402

The mortality is around 8%, with about 20% of patients remaining disabled. The purpose of this study is to examine the performance of Indian Medical Scientists in the area of GBS over a period of 40 years. India's contribution to GBS has been examined based on the global publication output and share, growth rate, citation impact, publication share in various field, highly cited papers and their impact, most productive authors and their citation impact and collaboration of research on GBS with the international community. MATERIALS AND METHODS The data for this study has been taken from Scopus, a multidisciplinary database using keywords GBS and Miller Fisher Syndrome. The contribution of India on GBS has been compared with different countries for its publication and citation count during a period of 40 years (1973-2012). RESULTS It is found that there were 10,633 publications available from global medical research covering the various aspects of GBS. India's share is 2.92% of global output and holds 10 th rank in overall publication output on GBS, whereas United States topped the rank with the highest number of publications. Sanjay Gandhi Post-graduate Institute of Medical Research, Lucknow is the most productive institutions while Tally AB from the National Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences, Bangalore is the most productive author who has contributed the highest number of papers on GBS. CONCLUSION India is far behind in GBS research as compared to other countries like USA, as there might be a low case report of GBS in Indian population.

In this case series, we describe the anatomy and frequency of radial artery loops and provide a technique for successful navigation of this anatomic anomaly. METHODS We reviewed our database of radial diagnostic or interventional neuroangiographic procedures to identify cases in which a radial loop was encountered during the procedure. The loop pattern, the presence of an associated recurrent radial artery branch, navigation technique, and procedure-related complications were recorded. A descriptive analysis was performed. RESULTS A total of 997 transradial approach procedures were performed over a 9-month period. A radial loop was identified in 10 (1.0%) patients. The average age was 68.6 ± 14.3 years. A microcatheter advanced over a microwire was used to navigate the loop and avoid entry into the recurrent branch. A diagnostic neuroangiographic procedure was performed successfully in 8 cases and an intervention was performed successfully in 1 case. A 360° loop was present in 2 of these cases. In each case, transradial access was performed successfully. In 1 other diagnostic case, transradial access was aborted, and the femoral artery was accessed to perform the procedure. CONCLUSIONS A radial loop was present in 1% of the cases in this series. Our technical results suggest that this anomaly should not be considered a contraindication to transradial neuroangiography because the procedure was successfully performed in most (9 of 10) cases using a microcatheter system to navigate the loop.","Dossani, Rimal H; Waqas, Muhammad; Tso, Michael K; Cappuzzo, Justin M; Popoola, Daniel; Snyder, Kenneth V; Levy, Elad I; Siddiqui, Adnan H; Davies, Jason M","Interventional neuroradiology : journal of peritherapeutic neuroradiology, surgical procedures and related neurosciences",https://doi.org/10.1177/1591019920982812; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33356726/,402

The limits of detection and quantitation were 90 and 280 ng/zone for magnolol and 70 and 200 ng/zone for honokiol, respectively. None of the two targeted neolignans were detected in two of the six analyzed supplements. In the other four samples, the measured amounts were between 0.95-114.69 mg g-1 for magnolol and 4.88-84.86 mg g-1 for honokiol. Moreover, separations of these two neolignans on the TLC and high-performance TLC (HPTLC) layers were compared and HPTLC was combined with antioxidant (DPPH) and antibacterial (Bacillus subtilis and Aliivibrio fischeri) assays and mass spectrometry (MS), using the elution-based interface. Both magnolol and honokiol exhibited effects in all bioactivity assays. The HPTLC-MS tests confirmed purity of neolignan zones in the extracts of dietary supplements and supported tentative identification of the alkaloid piperine and the isoflavone daidzein as additional bioactive components of the investigated dietary supplements. Using the same mobile phase in the orthogonal directions 2D-HPTLC-MS experiments proved degradation, i.e., instability of magnolol and honokiol on the silica gel adsorbent.","Łata, Eliza; Fulczyk, Agnieszka; Ott, Péter G; Kowalska, Teresa; Sajewicz, Mieczysław; Móricz, Ágnes M",Journal of chromatography.

129184,Effect of modified laparoscopic hysterectomy on pelvic floor function: A retrospective observational study.,2019,"Motor inhibition is a cognitive control ability that allows humans to stop actions rapidly even after initiation. Understanding and improving motor inhibition could benefit adaptive behavior in both health and disease. We recently found that presenting surprising, task-unrelated sounds when stopping is necessary improves the likelihood of successful stopping. In the current study, we investigated the neural underpinnings of this effect. Specifically, we tested whether surprise-related stopping improvements are due to a genuine increase in motor inhibition. In Experiment 1, we measured motor inhibition in primary motor cortex of male and female humans by quantifying corticospinal excitability (CSE) via transcranial magnetic stimulation and electromyography during a hybrid surprise-Go/NoGo task. Consistent with prior studies of motor inhibition, successful stopping was accompanied by nonselective suppression of CSE; that is, CSE was suppressed even in task-unrelated motor effectors. Importantly, unexpected sounds significantly increased this motor-system inhibition to a degree that was directly related to behavioral improvements in stopping. In Experiment 2, we then used scalp encephalography to investigate whether unexpected sounds increase motor-inhibition-related activity in the CNS. We used an independent stop-signal localizer task to identify a well characterized frontocentral low-frequency EEG component that indexes motor inhibition. We then investigated the activity of this component in the surprise-Go/NoGo task. Consistent with Experiment 1, this signature of motor inhibition was indeed increased when NoGo signals were followed by unexpected sounds. Together, these experiments provide converging evidence suggesting that unexpected events improve motor inhibition by automatically triggering inhibitory control.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT The ability to stop ongoing actions rapidly allows humans to adapt their behavior flexibly and rapidly. Action stopping is important in daily life (e.g., stopping to cross the street when a car approaches) and is severely impaired in many neuropsychiatric disorders. Therefore, finding ways to improve action stopping could aid adaptive behaviors in health and disease. Our current study shows that presenting unexpected sounds in stopping situations facilitates successful stopping. This improvement is specifically due to a surprise-related increase in a neural mechanism for motor inhibition, which rapidly suppresses the excitability of the motor system after unexpected events. These findings suggest a tight interaction between the neural systems for surprise processing and motor inhibition and yield a promising avenue for future research.","Dutra, Isabella C; Waller, Darcy A; Wessel, Jan R",The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience,https://doi.org/10.1523/jneurosci.3091-17.2017; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29305533/,402

130181,"Hospitalizations for heart failure during the COVID-19 pandemic: making sense of the known knowns, known unknowns, and unknown unknowns.",2020-07-02,"BACKGROUND Current methods to repair ablation-type peripheral nerve injuries (PNIs) using peripheral nerve allografts (PNAs) often result in poor functional recovery due to immunological rejection as well as to slow and inaccurate outgrowth of regenerating axonal sprouts. In contrast, ablation-type PNIs repaired by PNAs, using a multistep protocol in which one step employs the membrane fusogen polyethylene glycol (PEG), permanently restore sciatic-mediated behaviors within weeks. Axons and cells within PEG-fused PNAs remain viable, even though outbred host and donor tissues are neither immunosuppressed nor tissue matched. PEG-fused PNAs exhibit significantly reduced T cell and macrophage infiltration, expression of major histocompatibility complex I/II and consistently low apoptosis. In this study, we analyzed the coding transcriptome of PEG-fused PNAs to examine possible mechanisms underlying immunosuppression. METHODS Ablation-type sciatic PNIs in adult Sprague-Dawley rats were repaired using PNAs and a PEG-fusion protocol combined with neurorrhaphy. Electrophysiological and behavioral tests confirmed successful PEG-fusion of PNAs. RNA sequencing analyzed differential expression profiles of protein-coding genes between PEG-fused PNAs and negative control PNAs (not treated with PEG) at 14 days PO, along with unoperated control nerves. Sequencing results were validated by quantitative reverse transcription PCR (RT-qPCR), and in some cases, immunohistochemistry. RESULTS PEG-fused PNAs display significant downregulation of many gene transcripts associated with innate and adaptive allorejection responses. Schwann cell-associated transcripts are often upregulated, and cellular processes such as extracellular matrix remodeling and cell/tissue development are particularly enriched. Transcripts encoding several potentially immunosuppressive proteins (e.g., thrombospondins 1 and 2) also are upregulated in PEG-fused PNAs. CONCLUSIONS This study is the first to characterize the coding transcriptome of PEG-fused PNAs and to identify possible links between alterations of the extracellular matrix and suppression of the allorejection response. The results establish an initial molecular basis to understand mechanisms underlying PEG-mediated immunosuppression.","Smith, Tyler A; Ghergherehchi, Cameron L; Tucker, Haley O; Bittner, George D",Journal of neuroinflammation,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12974-020-01953-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33008419/,402

There are very few community-based studies on malnutrition among the elderly, especially in India. Objectives The objective was to find out the prevalence of malnutrition and its associated risk factors among the elderly in urbanized villages of Delhi. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted during November 2015 to April 2017 in two urbanized villages of East Delhi among 353 elderly (>60 years) individuals. A semi-structured interview schedule was used to record the sociodemographic and relevant personal details of the elderly. To determine the prevalence of malnutrition, Mini Nutritional Assessment scale was used. Statistical analysis included simple descriptive analysis and tests of significance such as Chi-square test. Multivariable logistic regression was used to identify the predictors of malnutrition. Results The prevalence of possible malnutrition was found to be 49.3%. On bivariate analysis, age, gender, education status, marital and residential status, per capita income, financial dependency, and family size were found to be associated with malnutrition (P < 0.05). Age >70 years, being tenant, and financial dependency were observed to be significant predictors of possible malnutrition in multiple logistic regression. Conclusion Malnutrition needs to be identified at an early stage using appropriate tools so that proper interventions can be directed to those who need it to ensure healthy aging. Social and economic parameters are linked with the occurrence of malnutrition among the elderly and must be considered in the development of preventive strategies.","Vaish, Kriti; Patra, Somdatta; Chhabra, Pragti",Indian journal of public health,https://doi.org/10.4103/ijph.ijph_150_19; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32985428/,402

We show that Inp1 is present in the correct subcellular location to interact with both the plasma membrane and peroxisomal membrane and has the structural and functional capacity to be a PM-PER tether. Additionally, expression of artificial PM-PER tethers is sufficient to restore retention in inp1Δ cells. We show that Inp1 mediates peroxisome retention via an N-terminal domain that binds PI(4,5)P2 and a C-terminal Pex3-binding domain, forming a bridge between the peroxisomal membrane and the plasma membrane. We provide the first molecular characterization of the PM-PER tether and show it anchors peroxisomes at the mother cell cortex, suggesting a new model for peroxisome retention.","Hulmes, Georgia E; Hutchinson, John D; Dahan, Noa; Nuttall, James M; Allwood, Ellen G; Ayscough, Kathryn R; Hettema, Ewald H",The Journal of cell biology,https://doi.org/10.1083/jcb.201906021; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32970792/,402

137098,Development and validation of a simplified nomogram predicting individual critical illness of risk in COVID-19: a retrospective study.,2020-09-25,"INTRODUCTION Emergency service (ambulance, police, fire) call-takers and dispatchers are often exposed to duty-related trauma, placing them at increased risk for developing mental health challenges like stress, anxiety, depression, and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Their unique working environment also puts them at-risk for physical health issues like obesity, headache, backache, and insomnia. Along with the stress associated with being on the receiving end of difficult calls, call-takers and dispatchers also deal with the pressure and demand of following protocol despite dealing with the variability of complex and stressful situations. METHODS A systematic literature review was conducted using the MEDLINE, PubMed, CINAHL, and PsychInfo databases. RESULTS A total of 25 publications were retrieved by the search strategy. The majority of studies (n = 13; 52%) reported a quantitative methodology, while nine (36%) reported the use of a qualitative research methodology. One study reported a mixed-methods methodology, one reported an evaluability assessment with semi-structured interviews, one reported on a case study, and one was a systematic review with a narrative synthesis. DISCUSSION Challenges to physical health included: shift-work leading to lack of physical activity, poor nutrition, and obesity; outdated and ergonomically ill-fitted equipment, and physically confining and isolating work spaces leading to physical injuries; inadequate breaks leading to fatigue; and high noise levels and poor lighting being correlated with higher cortisol levels. Challenges to mental health included: being exposed to traumatic calls; working in high-pressure environments with little downtime in between stressful calls; inadequate debriefing after stressful calls; inappropriate training for mental-health-related calls; and being exposed to verbally aggressive callers. Lack of support from leadership was an additional source of stress. CONCLUSION Emergency service call-takers and dispatchers experience both physical and mental health challenges as a result of their work, which appears to be related to a range of both operational and support-based issues. Future research should explore the long-term effects of these physical and mental health challenges.","Smith, Erin C; Holmes, Lisa; Burkle, Frederick M",Prehospital and disaster medicine,https://doi.org/10.1017/s1049023x19004990; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31637995/,402

We sought to investigate whether visit-to-visit HbA1c variability is a potential predictor of ISR in diabetic patients after stent implantation. METHODS We consecutively enrolled type 2 diabetic patients who underwent successful elective percutaneous coronary intervention and performed follow-up coronary angiography after around 12 months. The incidence of ISR and its relationship with visit-to-visit HbA1c variability, expressed as coefficient of variation (CV), standard deviation (SD) and variability independent of the mean (VIM), were studied. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards models were constructed to analyze the predictive value of HbA1c variability for ISR. RESULTS From September 2014 to July 2018 in Ruijin Hospital, a total of 420 diabetic patients (688 lesions) after stent implantation were included in the final analysis. During a mean follow-up of 12.8 ± 1.3 months, the incidence of ISR was 8.6%, which was significantly increased in patients with higher CV of HbA1c (P = 0.001). The mean diameter stenosis (DS), net luminal loss and net luminal gain were 22.9 ± 16.8%, 0.42 ± 0.88 mm and 1.66 ± 0.83 mm, respectively. Greater DS was observed in subjects with higher tertiles of CV of HbA1c (P < 0.001), and this trend was more prominent in patients with optimal glycemic control (HbA1c ≤ 7%) in the baseline. In multivariate analysis, HbA1c variability was independently associated with incidence of ISR after adjustment for traditional risk factors and mean HbA1c (HR: 3.00 [95% CI 1.14-7.92] for highest vs. lowest tertile). Inclusion of CV of HbA1c led to a better risk stratification accuracy. Assessing HbA1c variability by SD or VIM yielded similar findings. CONCLUSIONS This study suggests that visit-to-visit HbA1c variability is an independent predictor of incidence of ISR in patients with type 2 diabetes after stent implantation.

137452,Implementing recommended screening for critical congenital heart disease.,2013,"OBJECTIVE Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) produces more durable glycemic control than sleeve gastrectomy (SG) or intensive medical therapy (IMT). However, the contribution of acylated ghrelin (AG), a gluco-regulatory/appetite hormone, to improve glucose metabolism and body composition in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) following RYGB is unknown. DESIGN STAMPEDE (Surgical Treatment and Medication Potentially Eradicate Diabetes Efficiently) was a prospective, randomized controlled trial. SUBJECTS Fifty-three (body mass index: 36±3 kg m(-2), age: 49±9 years) poorly controlled patients with T2D (HbA1c (glycated hemoglobin): 9.7±2%) were randomized to IMT, IMT+RYGB or IMT+SG and underwent a mixed-meal tolerance test at baseline, 12, and 24 months for evaluation of AG suppression (postprandial minus fasting) and beta-cell function (oral disposition index; glucose-stimulated insulin secretion × Matsuda index). Total/android body fat (dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry) was also assessed. RESULTS RYGB and SG reduced body fat comparably (15-23 kg) at 12 and 24 months, whereas IMT had no effect. Beta-cell function increased 5.8-fold in RYGB and was greater than IMT at 24 months (P<0.001). However, there was no difference in insulin secretion between SG vs IMT at 24 months (P=0.32). Fasting AG was reduced fourfold following SG (P<0.01) and did not change with RYGB or IMT at 24 months. AG suppression improved more following RYGB than SG or IMT at 24 months (P=0.01 vs SG, P=0.07 vs IMT). At 24 months, AG suppression was associated with increased postprandial glucagon-like peptide-1 (r=-0.32, P<0.02) and decreased android fat (r=0.38; P<0.006). CONCLUSIONS Enhanced AG suppression persists for up to 2 years after RYGB, and this effect is associated with decreased android obesity and improved insulin secretion. Together, these findings suggest that AG suppression is partly responsible for the improved glucose control after RYGB surgery.","Malin, S K; Samat, A; Wolski, K; Abood, B; Pothier, C E; Bhatt, D L; Nissen, S; Brethauer, S A; Schauer, P R; Kirwan, J P; Kashyap, S R",International journal of obesity,https://doi.org/10.1038/ijo.2013.196; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24166065/,402

PPIs reduce reflux acidity, but only transiently inactivate gastric enzymes. Nonacid reflux, specifically nonacid pepsin, contributes to carcinogenesis in the larynx. Given the carcinogenic potential of pepsin and inefficacy of PPIs to prevent EAC, the presence and effect of pepsin in the esophagus should be investigated. METHODS Normal and Barrett's biopsies from 8 Barrett's esophagus patients were collected for pepsin analysis via Western blot and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Human esophageal cells cultured from healthy patients were treated with pepsin (0.01-1 mg/mL; 1-20 hours), acid (pH 4)±pepsin (5 minutes); real-time RT-PCR, ELISA, and cell migration were assayed. RESULTS Pepsin was detected in all 8 Barrett's and 4 of 8 adjacent normal specimens. Pepsinogen mRNA was observed in 22 Barrett's, but not in normal adjacent samples. Pepsin induced PTSG2 (COX-2) and IL-1β expression and cell migration in vitro. CONCLUSIONS Pepsin is synthesized by metaplastic, Barrett's esophageal mucosa. Nonacid pepsin increases metrics of tumorigenicity in esophageal epithelial cells in vitro. These findings implicate refluxed and locally synthesized pepsin in development and progression of EAC and, in part, explain the inefficacy of PPIs in the prevention of EAC.","Samuels, Tina; Hoekzema, Craig; Gould, Jon; Goldblatt, Matthew; Frelich, Matthew; Bosler, Matthew; Lee, Sang-Hyuk; Johnston, Nikki","The Annals of otology, rhinology, and laryngology",https://doi.org/10.1177/0003489415590657; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26077392/,402

Especially in dentistry, there is a growing concern due to it's high virulence and routes of transmission through saliva aerosols. The virus keeps viable on air for at least 3 hours and on plastic and stainless-steel surfaces up to 72 hours. In this sense, dental offices, both in the public and private sectors, are high-risk settings of cross infection among patients, dentists and health professionals in the clinical environment (including hospital's intensive dental care facilities). This manuscript aims to compile current available evidence on prevention strategies for dental professionals. Besides, we briefly describe promising treatment strategies recognized until this moment. The purpose is to clarify dental practitioners about the virus history and microbiology, besides guiding on how to proceed during emergency consultations based on international documents. Dentists should consider that a substantial number of individuals (including children) who do not show any signs and symptoms of COVID-19 may be infected and can disseminate the virus. Currently, there is no effective treatment and fast diagnosis is still a challenge. All elective dental treatments and non-essential procedures should be postponed, keeping only urgent and emergency visits to the dental office.

Coagulation dysfunction is a key pathogenetic element of this disease as well as a challenge for practitioners. Marked inflammatory process found in severe forms of COVID-19, the complement activation, the cytokine storm, and disruption of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system are involved in the onset of thrombotic microangiopathy and large vessel coagulopathy. Virus-induced procoagulant activity occurs at the systemic level. Intravascular microthrombi disrupt vascularization in various tissues and organs, contributing to the occurrence of multiorgan failure and explain the higher morbidity and all-cause mortality of patients. It is estimated that almost 20% of patients with COVID-19 have significant coagulation disorders, and about a quarter of those hospitalized in intensive care units are prone to develop thrombosis events under prophylactic anticoagulant treatment. Some of patients who have been immunized after healing from the SARS-CoV-2 infection have a hypercoagulable state and are prone to develop thrombosis. Hypercoagulability is supported by thrombelastographic analysis: patients have an acceleration of the propagation phase of blood clot formation and higher clot strength. Markers of coagulation dysfunction in SARS-CoV2 are: decreased platelet count, increased INR, presence of fibrin degradation products, and especially higher plasma levels of D-dimers, which predict unfavorable outcome in these patients. Age, pre-existing diseases and associated risk factors, together with careful monitoring of clinical evolution and laboratory parameters allow the choice of the best personalized prophylactic or curative anticoagulant treatment.","Mihaila, Romeo Gabriel; Dragos Mihaila, Marius","Biomedical papers of the Medical Faculty of the University Palacky, Olomouc, Czechoslovakia",https://doi.org/10.5507/bp.2020.037; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32901615/,402

DATA SOURCES Clinical and experimental studies and current guideline recommendations from the human literature; and original case studies, case reports, and previous reviews in the veterinary literature. SUMMARY Peritoneal dialysis involves the exchange of solutes and fluid between the peritoneal capillary blood and the dialysis solution across the peritoneal membrane. It requires placement of a peritoneal dialysis catheter for repeated dialysate exchange. The ideal catheter provides reliable, rapid dialysate flow rates without leaks or infections. Catheter selection and placement are reviewed along with dialysate selection, exchange prescriptions, and overall patient management. PD does not require specific or complex equipment, and it can achieve effective control of uremia and electrolyte imbalances. CONCLUSIONS Peritoneal dialysis is a potential life-saving measure for patients with acute renal failure. Peritoneal dialysis results in gradual decline in uremic toxins. Previously low success rates have been reported. Improved success rates have been noted in dogs with acute kidney injury (AKI) secondary to leptospirosis. Cats also have a good success rate when PD is elected in patients with a potentially reversible underlying disease. Overall, PD remains a viable intervention for patients with AKI unresponsive to medical management. In select patients a favorable outcome is attained whereby PD provides temporary support until return of effective renal function is attained.","Bersenas, Alexa M E",Journal of veterinary emergency and critical care,https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1476-4431.2011.00679.x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22316253/,402

145256,A systematic review of cerebral oxygenation-monitoring devices in cardiac surgery.,2014,"Current treatments for chronic immune-mediated diseases such as psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis, or Crohn's disease commonly rely on cytokine neutralization using monoclonal antibodies; however, such approaches have drawbacks. Frequent repeated dosing can lead to the formation of anti-drug antibodies and patient compliance issues, and it is difficult to identify a single antibody that is broadly efficacious across diverse patient populations. As an alternative to monoclonal antibody therapy, anti-cytokine immunization is a potential means for long-term therapeutic control of chronic inflammatory diseases. Here we report a supramolecular peptide-based approach for raising antibodies against IL-17 and demonstrate its efficacy in a murine model of psoriasis. B-cell epitopes from IL-17 were co-assembled with the universal T-cell epitope PADRE using the Q11 self-assembling peptide nanofiber system. These materials, with or without adjuvants, raised antibody responses against IL-17. Exploiting the modularity of the system, multifactorial experimental designs were used to select formulations maximizing titer and avidity. In a mouse model of psoriasis induced by imiquimod, unadjuvanted nanofibers had therapeutic efficacy, which could be enhanced with alum adjuvant but reversed with CpG adjuvant. Measurements of antibody subclass induced by adjuvanted and unadjuvanted formulations revealed strong correlations between therapeutic efficacy and titers of IgG1 (improved efficacy) or IgG2b (worsened efficacy). These findings have important implications for the development of anti-cytokine active immunotherapies and suggest that immune phenotype is an important metric for eliciting therapeutic anti-cytokine antibody responses.","Shores, Lucas S; Kelly, Sean H; Hainline, Kelly M; Suwanpradid, Jutamas; MacLeod, Amanda S; Collier, Joel H",Frontiers in immunology,https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2020.01855; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32973764/,402
145448,CSF biomarkers in patients with COVID-19 and neurological symptoms: A case series.,2020-10-01,"BACKGROUND AIMS The scarcity of human islets for transplantation remains a major limitation of cell replacement therapy for diabetes. Bone marrow-derived progenitor cells are of interest because they can be isolated, expanded and offered for such therapy under autologous/allogeneic settings. METHODS We characterized and compared human bone marrow-derived mesenchymal cells (hBMC) obtained from (second trimester), young (1-24 years) and adult (34-81 years) donors. We propose a novel protocol that involves assessment of paracrine factors from regenerating pancreas in differentiation and maturation of hBMC into endocrine pancreatic lineage in vivo. RESULTS We observed that donor age was inversely related to growth potential of hBMC. Following in vitro expansion and exposure to specific growth factors involved in pancreatic development, hBMC migrated and formed islet-like cell aggregates (ICA). ICA show increased abundance of pancreatic transcription factors (Ngn3, Brn4, Nkx6.1, Pax6 and Isl1). Although efficient differentiation was not achieved in vitro, we observed significant maturation and secretion of human c-peptide (insulin) upon transplantation into pancreactomized and Streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic mice. Transplanted ICA responded to glucose and maintained normoglycemia in diabetic mice. CONCLUSIONS Our data demonstrate that hBMC have tremendous in vitro expansion potential and can be differentiated into multiple lineages, including the endocrine pancreatic lineage. Paracrine factors secreted from regenerating pancreas help in efficient differentiation and maturation of hBMC, possibly via recruiting chromatin modulators, to generate glucose-responsive insulin-secreting cells.","Phadnis, Smruti M; Joglekar, Mugdha V; Dalvi, Maithili P; Muthyala, Sudhakar; Nair, Prabha D; Ghaskadbi, Surendra M; Bhonde, Ramesh R; Hardikar, Anandwardhan A",Cytotherapy,https://doi.org/10.3109/14653249.2010.523108; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21039304/,402

A randomized clinical trial.,2020-08-08,"BACKGROUND Laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) has shown to be effective in serum triglycerides reduction and HDL cholesterol increase, but with little effect on total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol. Physical activity is recognized as an effective non-pharmacological intervention to reduce body fat mass and hypercholesterolemia. METHODS A prospective observational study of all the patients undergoing LSG as bariatric technique between 2007 and 2012 was performed. All patients completed the Spanish Version of the Modifiable Physical Activity Questionnaire at two time points: baseline (pre-intervention) and 1 year after surgery, both in face-to-face interviews. Lipid profiles were monitored at the same time points. RESULTS A total of 50 patients were included in the study, 44 females (88 %) and six males (12 %) with a mean age of 42.7 ± 10.3 years. Comorbidities included dyslipidemia in 50 % (40 % hypercholesterolemia and 10 % hypertriglyceridemia). Preoperatively, four patients (8 %) reported moderately active physical activity and one patient (2 %) active physical exercise. The rest of the patients were sedentary. One year after surgery, 30 patients (60 %) performed any kind of active physical activity, while the rest were sedentary. Lipid profile 12 months after surgery showed significantly lower total cholesterol levels in the active group (182.8 mg/dl vs 220 mg/dl in the sedentary group; p = 0.003). LDL cholesterol levels were also lower in the active group (103.2 vs 133 mg/dl in the sedentary group; p = 0.015). CONCLUSION The performance of routine moderate physical activity in addition to LSG achieves a significant improvement in all parameters of the lipid profile.","Ruiz-Tovar, Jaime; Zubiaga, Lorea; Llavero, Carolina; Diez, María; Arroyo, Antonio; Calpena, Rafael",Obesity surgery,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11695-013-1082-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24096924/,402

ILC3 also includes splenic and decidual ILC3. Like other physiological processes in the organism, enteric ILC3 functions are precisely regulated at the endogenous and exogenous levels. However, there has been no review on the physiological functions and regulatory signals of intestinal ILC3. In this paper, based on the current research on the physiological functions of enteric ILC3 in animals and the human, we summarize the signals that regulate cytokine secretion, antigen presentation and the quantity of ILC3 under normal intestinal conditions. We discuss for the first time the classification of the promoting mechanism of secretagogues of ILC3 into direct and indirect types. We also propose that ILC3 can promote intestinal homeostasis, and intestinal homeostasis can ensure the physiological phenotype of ILC3. If homeostasis is disturbed, ILC3 may participate in intestinal pathological changes. Therefore, regulating ILC3 and maintaining intestinal homeostasis are critical to the body.","Xian, Yin; Lv, Xiaodong; Xie, Minjia; Xiao, Fuyang; Kong, Chenyang; Ren, Yixing",Life sciences,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.lfs.2020.118504; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32991877/,402

DESIGN Case report (Canadian Task Force classification III). SETTING Tertiary referral center in New Haven, Connecticut. INTERVENTIONS This is a step-by-step illustration for resection of a retroperitoneal para-aortic schwannoma and of an incidentally found Meckel diverticulum. The patient was a 39-year-old white woman diagnosed with stage IV choriocarcinoma with metastasis to the lungs and left para-aortic area. She received chemotherapy in the form of etoposide, methotrexate, actinomycin-D, cyclophosphamide, oncovine (EMA-CO) and had an excellent clinical response with resolution of all metastatic disease except for the para-aortic mass. Therefore, she was taken to the operating room for laparoscopic resection of the persistent left para-aortic mass. After placement of four 5-mm abdominal ports, the pelvis and abdomen were explored and revealed an incidental Meckel diverticulum as well as the 5 cm left para-aortic mass. The peritoneum overlying the para-aortic mass was incised and the retroperitoneum explored. Given the proximity to the mass, left ureterolysis was performed. The retroperitoneal attachments were resected, and the left para-aortic mass was removed without any complications. At this point attention was turned to the Meckel diverticulum. In order not to extend the abdominal incisions, a posterior colpotomy was performed in the cul-de-sac equidistant from the uterosacral ligaments. Endo-GIA (Covidien, New Haven CT) was introduced through the 10-mm port site at the posterior colpotomy. Meckel diverticulum was resected without narrowing the lumen of the distal ileum. The specimen was removed in a contained manner through posterior colpotomy. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS The procedure was performed without any complications. The patient had an uneventful postoperative course and was discharged home on postoperative day 0. Pathology revealed a retroperitoneal schwannoma with negative margins and benign Meckel diverticulum without ectopic gastric or pancreatic tissue. The patient has been disease-free since the completion of surgery. CONCLUSION Laparoscopic resection of the retroperitoneal schwannoma and Meckel diverticulum were successfully performed in this patient with history of stage IV choriocarcinoma. To our knowledge, this is the first report describing a natural orifice-assisted laparoscopic approach for resection of Meckel diverticulum. Natural orifice-assisted laparoscopy should be considered when the surgeon needs to remove a large specimen and/or to introduce >5-mm diameter instruments into the peritoneal cavity without having to extend the abdominal incisions.","Menderes, Gulden; Dugan, Katherine; Klein, Maximillian J; Azodi, Masoud",Journal of minimally invasive gynecology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmig.2017.04.015; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28478192/,402
147245,Clinical findings in a group of COVID-19 patients: a single-center retrospective study.,2021-01-01,"BACKGROUND Many patients with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) receive red cell transfusions to relieve symptoms associated with anemia, with transfusions triggered by hemoglobin level. It is not known if patients' quality of life (QOL) improves after transfusion, nor if peri-transfusion QOL assessment (PTQA) can guide future transfusion decisions. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS We conducted a prospective pilot study of adults with MDS at three centers. Participants, who had to have hemoglobin ≥7.5, completed an MDS-specific measure of QOL (the Quality of Life in Myelodysplasia Scale, [QUALMS]) 1 day before and 7 days after red cell transfusion. A report was sent to each patient and provider before the next transfusion opportunity, indicating whether there were clinically significant changes in QOL. We assessed the proportion of patients experiencing changes in QOL, and with a follow-up questionnaire, whether they perceived their PTQA data were used for future transfusion decisions. RESULTS From 2018 to 2020, 62 patients enrolled (mean age 73 years) and 37 completed both pre- and post-transfusion QOL assessments. Of these, 35% experienced a clinically significant increase in QUALMS score 7 days after transfusion; 46% no change; and 19% a decrease. Among those completing the follow-up questionnaire, 23% reported that PTQA results were discussed by their provider when considering repeat transfusion. CONCLUSIONS These data suggest PTQA is feasible for patients with MDS. Moreover, while helpful for some, for many others, red cell transfusion may not achieve its intended goal of improving QOL. PTQA offers a strategy to inform shared decision-making regarding red cell transfusion.","Abel, Gregory A; Klepin, Heidi D; Magnavita, Emily S; Jaung, Tim; Lu, Wen; Shallis, Rory M; Hantel, Andrew; Bahl, Nupur E; Dellinger-Johnson, Rebecca; Winer, Eric S; Zeidan, Amer M",Transfusion,https://doi.org/10.1111/trf.16584; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34251040/,402

We systematically reviewed the efficacy and safety of liberal versus conservative oxygen therapy in acutely ill adults. METHODS In the Improving Oxygen Therapy in Acute-illness (IOTA) systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, Embase, HealthSTAR, LILACS, PapersFirst, and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry from inception to Oct 25, 2017, for randomised controlled trials comparing liberal and conservative oxygen therapy in acutely ill adults (aged ≥18 years). Studies limited to patients with chronic respiratory diseases or psychiatric disease, patients on extracorporeal life support, or patients treated with hyperbaric oxygen therapy or elective surgery were excluded. We screened studies and extracted summary estimates independently and in duplicate. We also extracted individual patient-level data from survival curves. The main outcomes were mortality (in-hospital, at 30 days, and at longest follow-up) and morbidity (disability at longest follow-up, risk of hospital-acquired pneumonia, any hospital-acquired infection, and length of hospital stay) assessed by random-effects meta-analyses. We assessed quality of evidence using the grading of recommendations assessment, development, and evaluation approach. This study is registered with PROSPERO, number CRD42017065697. FINDINGS 25 randomised controlled trials enrolled 16 037 patients with sepsis, critical illness, stroke, trauma, myocardial infarction, or cardiac arrest, and patients who had emergency surgery. Compared with a conservative oxygen strategy, a liberal oxygen strategy (median baseline saturation of peripheral oxygen [SpO2] across trials, 96% [range 94-99%, IQR 96-98]) increased mortality in-hospital (relative risk [RR] 1·21, 95% CI 1·03-1·43, I2=0%, high quality), at 30 days (RR 1·14, 95% CI 1·01-1·29, I2=0%, high quality), and at longest follow-up (RR 1·10, 95% CI 1·00-1·20, I2=0%, high quality). Morbidity outcomes were similar between groups. Findings were robust to trial sequential, subgroup, and sensitivity analyses. INTERPRETATION In acutely ill adults, high-quality evidence shows that liberal oxygen therapy increases mortality without improving other patient-important outcomes. Supplemental oxygen might become unfavourable above an SpO2 range of 94-96%. These results support the conservative administration of oxygen therapy.

In 2018, most Australian jurisdictions implemented funded influenza vaccine programs targeted at improving vaccine uptake in this age group. Our aim was to determine how successful these programs were at improving self-reported seasonal influenza vaccine uptake at the community level by comparing vaccination rates in each Australian jurisdiction before and after the introduction of funded vaccines for children aged 6 months to less than 5 years, as well as other age groups. STUDY TYPE Volunteer observational cohort study. METHODS Flutracking is an email-based surveillance tool for influenza-like illness that collects information about symptoms and influenza vaccination. We used historical data from 2014 to 2017 to estimate baseline vaccination status before funding of childhood influenza vaccines was introduced. We compared self-reported vaccine uptake in children younger than 5 years, children aged 5-17 years and adults (18-64 years, and 65 years and older) in 2018 and 2019 by state or territory. Mixed effects logistic regressions were used to measure the association between vaccination and a number of predictors, including whether the child was eligible for free vaccines, and whether adults resided with children or not. RESULTS We found large increases in vaccine uptake for children younger than 5 years in 2018 in all jurisdictions except Western Australia (where vaccines were already funded) and the Northern Territory (where funded vaccines were not introduced until 2019) that coincided with vaccine policy changes. Self-reported vaccination rates for young children in 2018 increased 2.7-4.2-fold in jurisdictions that funded the vaccine (compared with the previous, unfunded period). Being eligible for the funded vaccine was associated with much higher odds (odds ratio [OR] 4.75; 95% confidence interval [CI] 4.57, 4.79) of a young child being vaccinated. Older children and adults younger than 65 years were also more likely to receive the vaccine following policy changes. CONCLUSION The seasonal influenza vaccine is an important protective measure for those at risk of serious outcomes, including young children. Flutracking data demonstrates that government-funded vaccines can lead to an almost five-fold increase in self-reported vaccine uptake of the targeted age group, as well as previously unreported flow-on effects to older children. This suggests that funded vaccines for young children may encourage caregivers to also vaccinate themselves and their older children.","Howard, Zachary L; Howard, Craig; Carlson, Sandra; Baldwin, Zoe; Durrheim, David N",Public health research & practice,https://doi.org/10.17061/phrp3112104; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33690785/,402

The coating with self-assembled monolayers, such as glycidoxypropyltrimethoxysilane (GOPS) can also improve the materials characteristics of implants. This approach was not yet explored in hernia meshes. It was the aim of this work to clarify if and how hernia meshes with their three-dimensional structure can be coated with GOPS and with which technique this coating can be best characterized. Commercially available meshes made from polypropylene (PP), polyester (PE), and expanded polytetrafluorethylene (ePTFE) have been coated with GOPS. The coatings were analyzed via X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM), and cell proliferation test (mouse fibroblasts). Cell viability and cytotoxicity were tested by MTT test. With the GOPS surface modification, the adherence of mouse fibroblasts on polyester meshes and the proliferation on ePTFE meshes were increased compared to noncoated meshes. Both XPS and CLSM are limited in their applicability and validity due to the three-dimensional mesh structure while CLSM was overall more suitable. In the MTT test, no negative effects of the GOPS coating on the cells were detected after 24 h. The present results show that GOPS coating of hernia meshes is feasible and effective. GOPS coating can be achieved in a fast and cost-efficient way. Further investigations are necessary with respect to coating quality and adverse effects before such a coating may be used in the clinical routine. In conclusion, GOPS is a promising material that warrants further research as coating of medical implants. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

In this study, we demonstrate that peptides modified with cholesterol or 3 U of polyethylene glycol (PEG3) conjugated to the peptides' N termini showed even more promising antiviral activities when tested in animal models. Both cholesterol- and cholesterol-PEG3-tagged peptides were able to protect chicken embryos from infection with different serotypes of NDV and IBV when administered 12 h prior to virus inoculation. In comparison, the untagged peptides required intervention closer to the time of viral inoculation to achieve a similar level of protection. Intramuscular injection of cholesterol-tagged peptide at 1.6 mg/kg 1 day before virus infection and then three times at 3-day intervals after viral inoculation protected 70% of the chickens from NDV infection. We further demonstrate that the cholesterol-tagged peptide has an in vivo half-life greater than that of untagged peptides. It also has the potential to cross the blood-brain barrier to enter the avian central nervous system (CNS). Finally, we show that the cholesterol-tagged peptide could play a role before the viral fusion peptide's insertion into the host cell and thereby target an earlier stage of fusion glycoprotein activation.

It is worth reflecting on the changes and challenges in PHC during the COVID-19 pandemic in Brasil.","Gois-Santos, Vanessa Tavares de; Santos, Victor Santana; Souza, Carlos Dornels Freire de; Tavares, Carolina Santos Souza; Gurgel, Ricardo Queiroz; Martins-Filho, Paulo Ricardo",Revista da Associacao Medica Brasileira,https://doi.org/10.1590/1806-9282.66.7.876; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32844947/,402
155144,Heartbeat: Rapid rule-out pathways for acute myocardial infarction.,2020-07-01,"Influenza, pneumococcal disease, and shingles (herpes zoster) are more prevalent in older people. These illnesses are preventable via vaccination, but uptake is low and decreasing. Little research has focused on understanding the psychosocial reasons behind older adults' hesitancy towards different vaccines. A cross-sectional survey with 372 UK-based adults aged 65-92 years (M = 70.5) assessed awareness and uptake of the influenza, pneumococcal, and shingles vaccines. Participants provided health and socio-demographic data and completed two scales measuring the psychosocial factors associated with vaccination behaviour. Self-reported daily functioning, cognitive difficulties, and social support were also assessed. Participants were additionally given the opportunity to provide free text responses outlining up to three main reasons for their vaccination decisions. We found that considerably more participants had received the influenza vaccine in the last 12 months (83.6%), relative to having ever received the pneumococcal (60.2%) and shingles vaccines (58.9%). Participants were more aware of their eligibility for the influenza vaccine, and were more likely to have been offered it. Multivariate logistic regression analyses showed that a lower sense of collective responsibility independently predicted lack of uptake of all three vaccines. Greater calculation of disease and vaccination risk, and preference for natural immunity, also predicted not getting the influenza vaccine. For both the pneumococcal and shingles vaccines, concerns about profiteering further predicted lack of uptake. Analysis of the qualitative responses highlighted that participants vaccinated to protect their own health and that of others. Our findings suggest that interventions targeted towards older adults would benefit from being vaccine-specific and that they should emphasise disease risks and vaccine benefits for the individual, as well as the benefits of vaccination for the wider community. These findings can help inform intervention development aimed at increasing vaccination uptake in future.","Nicholls, Louise A Brown; Gallant, Allyson J; Cogan, Nicola; Rasmussen, Susan; Young, David; Williams, Lynn",Vaccine,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2021.04.062; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34023136/,402

156341,Low reproducibility of randomized clinical trials methodology related to sampling: a systematic methodological review.,2019,"BACKGROUND Ventral incisional hernias (VIH) develop in up to 20% of patients after abdominal surgery. No widely applicable preoperative risk-assessment tool exists. We aimed to develop and validate a risk-assessment tool to predict VIH after abdominal surgery. STUDY DESIGN A prospective study of all patients undergoing abdominal surgery was conducted at a single institution from 2008 to 2010. Variables were defined in accordance with the National Surgical Quality Improvement Project, and VIH was determined through clinical and radiographic evaluation. A multivariate Cox proportional hazard model was built from a development cohort (2008 to 2009) to identify predictors of VIH. The HERNIAscore was created by converting the hazards ratios (HR) to points. The predictive accuracy was assessed on the validation cohort (2010) using a receiver operator characteristic curve and calculating the area under the curve (AUC). RESULTS Of 625 patients followed for a median of 41 months (range 0.3 to 64 months), 93 (13.9%) developed a VIH. The training cohort (n = 428, VIH = 70, 16.4%) identified 4 independent predictors: laparotomy (HR 4.77, 95% CI 2.61 to 8.70) or hand-assisted laparoscopy (HAL, HR 4.00, 95% CI 2.08 to 7.70), COPD (HR 2.35; 95% CI 1.44 to 3.83), and BMI ≥ 25 kg/m(2) (HR1.74; 95% CI 1.04 to 2.91). Factors that were not predictive included age, sex, American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) score, albumin, immunosuppression, previous surgery, and suture material or technique. The predictive score had an AUC = 0.77 (95% CI 0.68 to 0.86) using the validation cohort (n = 197, VIH = 23, 11.6%). Using the HERNIAscore: HERNIAscore = 4(∗)Laparotomy+3(∗)HAL+1(∗)COPD+1(∗) BMI ≥ 25, 3 classes stratified the risk of VIH: class I (0 to 3 points),5.2%; class II (4 to 5 points),19.6%; and class III (6 points), 55.0%. CONCLUSIONS The HERNIAscore accurately identifies patients at increased risk for VIH. Although external validation is needed, this provides a starting point to counsel patients and guide clinical decisions. Increasing the use of laparoscopy, weight-loss programs, community smoking prevention programs, and incisional reinforcement may help reduce rates of VIH.","Goodenough, Christopher J; Ko, Tien C; Kao, Lillian S; Nguyen, Mylan T; Holihan, Julie L; Alawadi, Zeinab; Nguyen, Duyen H; Flores, Juan R; Arita, Nestor T; Roth, J Scott; Liang, Mike K",Journal of the American College of Surgeons,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jamcollsurg.2014.12.027; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25690673/,402

Here, we tested this prediction by using state-dependent millisecond-resolved real-time electroencephalography-triggered dual-coil transcranial magnetic stimulation (EEG-TMS) (Zrenner et al., 2018) to target the EEG-negative (high-excitability state) versus EEG-positive peak (low-excitability state) of the sensorimotor μ-rhythm in the left (conditioning) and right (test) motor cortex (M1) of 16 healthy human subjects (9 female, 7 male). Effective connectivity was tested by short-interval interhemispheric inhibition (SIHI); that is, the inhibitory effect of the conditioning TMS pulse given 10-12 ms before the test pulse on the test motor-evoked potential. We compared the four possible combinations of excitability states (negative peak, positive peak) and phase relations (in-phase, out-of-phase) of the μ-rhythm in the conditioning and test M1 and a random phase condition. Strongest SIHI was found when the two M1 were in phase for the high-excitability state (negative peak of the μ-rhythm), whereas the weakest SIHI occurred when they were out of phase and the conditioning M1 was in the low-excitability state (positive peak). Phase synchronicity contributed significantly to SIHI variation, with stronger SIHI in the in-phase than out-of-phase conditions. These findings are in exact accord with the predictions of the theory of communication through coherence. They open a translational route for highly effective modification of brain connections by repetitive stimulation at instants in time when nodes in the network are phase synchronized and excitable.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT The theory of communication through coherence predicts that effective connectivity between nodes in distributed oscillating brain networks depends on their instantaneous excitability and phase relation. We tested this hypothesis in healthy human subjects by real-time analysis of brain states by electroencephalography in combination with transcranial magnetic stimulation of left and right motor cortex. We found that short-interval interhemispheric inhibition, a marker of interhemispheric effective connectivity, was maximally expressed when the two motor cortices were in phase for a high-excitability state (the trough of the sensorimotor μ-rhythm). We conclude that findings are consistent with the theory of communication through coherence. They open a translational route to highly effectively modify brain connections by repetitive stimulation at instants in time of phase-synchronized high-excitability states.","Stefanou, Maria-Ioanna; Desideri, Debora; Belardinelli, Paolo; Zrenner, Christoph; Ziemann, Ulf",The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience,https://doi.org/10.1523/jneurosci.1470-18.2018; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30355634/,402

160367,Negative Symptoms and Functioning in Youth at Risk of Psychosis: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.,2020,"UNLABELLED Enveloped viruses carry highly specialized glycoproteins that catalyze membrane fusion under strict spatial and temporal control. To prevent premature activation after biosynthesis, viral class I fusion proteins adopt a locked conformation and require proteolytic cleavage to render them fusion-ready. This priming step may occur during virus exit from the infected cell, in the extracellular milieu or during entry at or in the next target cell. Proteolytic processing of coronavirus spike (S) fusion proteins during virus entry has been suggested but not yet formally demonstrated, while the nature and functionality of the resulting subunit is still unclear. We used a prototype coronavirus--mouse hepatitis virus (MHV)--to develop a conditional biotinylation assay that enables the specific identification and biochemical characterization of viral S proteins on virions that mediated membrane fusion with the target cell. We demonstrate that MHV S proteins are indeed cleaved upon virus endocytosis, and we identify a novel processing product S2* with characteristics of a fusion-active subunit. The precise cleavage site and the enzymes involved remain to be elucidated. IMPORTANCE Virus entry determines the tropism and is a crucial step in the virus life cycle. We developed an approach to characterize structural components of virus particles after entering new target cells. A prototype coronavirus was used to illustrate how the virus fusion machinery can be controlled.","Wicht, Oliver; Burkard, Christine; de Haan, Cornelis A M; van Kuppeveld, Frank J M; Rottier, Peter J M; Bosch, Berend Jan",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.03451-13; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24554652/,402

During the Italian lockdown caused by COVID-19, while the use of technology was the fundamental basis of adaptation for smart working, school and professional training, leading to a change in the population's lifestyle, smartphone dependency caused impaired social relationships. To date, the impact of smartphone dependency in men and women is unclear. We conducted this study with the hypothesis that a period of lockdown fosters the growth of a pathological use of the cell phone different in women and men. OBJECTIVE The purpose of this work is to investigate gender differences in the level of smartphone dependency in teens and adults during the COVID-19 lockdown period. MATERIAL AND METHODS The NoMobilePhobia-Questionnaire (NMP-Q) was presented online to 1264 participants between the ages of 15 and 67. RESULTS The results show no significant main effects for the two factors taken into account (Gender and Age of participants). However, the significant interaction shows that female participants reported on average higher scores on NMP-Q than males, [F(4,1253) =7.06 and p<.001, observed power close to 1 (0.99) and effect size = 0.03 (ETA partial squared)] for the younger age group (15-44), while for those over the age of 44, the average highest scores were for male participants. CONCLUSIONS One of the ""positive"" aspects of the COVID-19 pandemic is the use of the Internet and smartphones, and our analysis aimed to document the frequency of use in the Italian context with the NMP-Q. However, we can also conclude that this research is relevant because it can give us a glimpse of the relationship between dependency and mental issues. The results reveal the risk in some of the Italian population of developing forms of smartphone dependency, especially in circumstances that prohibit direct social interactions.","Caponnetto, Pasquale; Inguscio, Lucio; Valeri, Sara; Maglia, Marilena; Polosa, Riccardo; Lai, Carlo; Mazzoni, Giuliana",Journal of addictive diseases,https://doi.org/10.1080/10550887.2021.1889751; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33655815/,402

A Single Centre Experience in Southern Italy.,2021-01-01,"BACKGROUND Parastomal hernia (PSH) is common after stoma formation. Studies have reported that mesh prophylaxis reduces PSH, but there are no cost-effectiveness data. Our objective was to determine the cost effectiveness of mesh prophylaxis vs no prophylaxis to prevent PSH in patients undergoing abdominoperineal resection with permanent colostomy for rectal cancer. STUDY DESIGN Using a cohort Markov model, we modeled the costs and effectiveness of mesh prophylaxis vs no prophylaxis at the index operation in a cohort of 60-year-old patients undergoing abdominoperineal resection for rectal cancer during a time horizon of 5 years. Costs were expressed in 2012 Canadian dollars (CAD$) and effectiveness in quality-adjusted life years. Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed. RESULTS In patients with stage I to III rectal cancer, prophylactic mesh was dominant (less costly and more effective) compared with no mesh. In patients with stage IV disease, mesh prophylaxis was associated with higher cost (CAD$495 more) and minimally increased effectiveness (0.05 additional quality-adjusted life years), resulting in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of CAD$10,818 per quality-adjusted life year. On sensitivity analyses, the decision was sensitive to the probability of mesh infection and the cost of the mesh, and method of diagnosing PSH. CONCLUSIONS In patients undergoing abdominoperineal resection with permanent colostomy for rectal cancer, mesh prophylaxis might be the less costly and more effective strategy compared with no mesh to prevent PSH in patients with stage I to III disease, and might be cost effective in patients with stage IV disease.","Lee, Lawrence; Saleem, Abdulaziz; Landry, Tara; Latimer, Eric; Chaudhury, Prosanto; Feldman, Liane S",Journal of the American College of Surgeons,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jamcollsurg.2013.09.015; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24210147/,402

162800,Association of comorbidities with COVID-19 infection rate and severity: nationwide cohort study with propensity score matching,2021-09-26,"Background: In the last time, many papers about SARS-CoV-2 have been published in the world. However, data from latinamerican patients is still scarce. In order to assess the impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection in patients with rheumatic diseases in our country and contribute to the global knowledge about the effect of immunosuppressive therapies in this group, the Argentine Society of Rheumatology has developed the National Registry of Patients with Rheumatic Diseases and COVID-19 (SAR-COVID). Objectives: The aim of this study was to evaluate clinical characteristics and outcomes of SARS-CoV-2 infection in patients with rheumatic diseases, treated or not with immunomodulators and/or immunosuppressants. Methods: SAR-COVID is a national, multicenter, prospective and observational registry, in which patients, ≥18 years of age, with a diagnosis of a rheumatic disease who had SARS-CoV-2 infection (PCR or positive serology) are consecutively included between August 13, 2020 and January 17, 2021. Sociodemographic data, comorbidities, underlying rheumatic disease and treatment, clinical characteristics, complications, laboratory and treatment of the SARS-CoV-2 infection were recorded. Hospitalization, mechanical ventilation requirements and death were assessed to evaluate COVID-19 outcome. Statistical analysis: Descriptive analysis. Chi2 or Fischer test and T test or Mann-Whitney U test or ANOVA, as appropriate. Multiple logistic regression. Results: A total of 525 patients were included, 80.4% were female, with a median age of 52 years (IQR 40-62). Comorbidities were reported in half of them (53.3%). The most frequent rheumatological diseases were rheumatoid arthritis (40.4%) and systemic lupus erythematosus (14.9%). At the time of the infection, most of them were in remission or in minimal/low disease activity (68.2%) and 72.9% were receiving immunosuppressive or immunomodulatory treatment. Symptoms were present in 96% of the patients, the most frequent being fever (56.2%), cough (46.7%) and headache (39.2%). During infection, 35.1% received some pharmacological treatment, dexamethasone (20%) the most frequently used. One third (35.1%) of the patients were hospitalized, 11.6% were admitted to the ICU, 10.1% needed mechanical ventilation and 6.9% died due to COVID-19. Complications were reported in 12.4%, being acute respiratory distress syndrome the most prevalent (8.8%). Patients over 65 years of age were more frequently hospitalized, admitted to the ICU, needed mechanical ventilation and died due to COVID-19 (50% vs 31.4%, 22% vs 9%, 16.3% vs 5.2%, 14% vs 5%, respectively;p<0.001 in all cases). Similar results were seen in patients with vasculitis (57.7% vs 33.9%, 46.2 vs 9.8%, 34.6% vs 6 %;30.8% vs 5.6%, respectively;p< 0.001 in all cases) and those with moderate/high disease activity (55.7% vs 26.5%, 21.3 vs 7.8%, 17.2% vs 4.2 %;17.2% vs 4.2 %, respectively;p< 0.001 in all cases). Patients with APS were more frequently admitted to the ICU (29.4% vs 11%, p= 0.037). The presence of comorbidities was associated with higher hospitalization (46% vs 22.6%, p<0.001), admission to the ICU (17.2% vs 5.9%, p<0.001) and mechanical ventilation (10.2% vs 4.6%, p= 0.028). Immunosuppressive treatment was not associated with worse outcomes. Conclusion: In this cohort of patients with a wide distribution of rheumatic diseases, we have found clinical characteristics similar to those reported by other international cohorts. Compared with national data, the mortality reported in these patients is higher. However, it should be noted that these are early data collected during isolation and that there may be an underreporting of asymptomatic patients or with mild symptoms who do not attend the rheumatologist. Older patients, those with comorbidities, with vasculitis and with higher disease activity showed poor COVID-19 outcomes.","Isnardi, C. A.; Quintana, R.; Roberts, K.; Castro Coello, V. V.; Reyes, A.

We previously reported an excellent concordance between the Disease Activity Score (DAS-28) performed by physicians and patients at the baseline visit of this prospective study (1). Objectives: To evaluate the persistence of the concordance between the physician' and the patient's assessment of disease activity in RA using DAS-28 after one year. Methods: At the baseline visit, patients with RA from 7 Middle Eastern Arab Countries (MEAC) were briefed about DAS-28 by their rheumatologist during a routine consultation and given smartphone access to a video in Arabic language explaining the performance of DAS-28. At 3, 6 and 12 months (± 3 months), the patients were asked to self-report DAS-28, blinded to the physician's assessment. Concordance between the continuous DAS-28 at each visit was calculated using paired t-test numerically and the Bland-Altman method graphically. Agreement between physician-and patient-DAS categories (remission, low-, moderate-and high disease activity) was calculated at each visit using weighted kappa for category comparison. Weighted kappa of the different agreements were compared over time using their respective confidence intervals (CIs). Predictive factors of positive concordance between physician and patient-DAS were identified using binary logistic regression. Results: The study included 428 patients over a period of three years (2018 to 2020). The mean age of participants was 49.8 years, 82.5% were females, 44.3% had a university degree and the mean disease duration was 11.4 years. At baseline, the average patient-DAS was higher (4.06 (±1.52)) than the physician-DAS (3.97 (±1.52)). The mean difference was -0.09 [95%CI -0.14;-0.04] and most of the pairs were within the limit of agreement in the Bland-Altman graph, indicating a good concordance, particularly in cases of remission. During the study follow-up, 299 patients consulted for visit 2 (69.9% of the total population), 232 for visit 3 (54.2%) and 199 for visit 4 (46.5%). The weighted kappa was 0.80 [95%CI 0.76;0.85] at visit 1 and 0.79 [95%CI 0.72;0.88] at visit 4 (Figure 1 showing kappa for DAS-28, CDAI and SDAI as well). A minor numerical decrease in kappa was observed over time;however, the CIs were overlapping over the four visits and the agreement was considered stable, remaining in the excellent range. At visit 4, a positive concordance between the physician-and the patient-DAS was associated with the profession (lower in blue collar, p=0.001), the educational level (higher in high school and university, p=0.034) and the baseline physician's DAS (higher in high disease activity, p=0.46). Conclusion: The agreement between the DAS-28 performed by the physician and by the patient was excellent at baseline and remained stable over one year. A positive concordance was associated with the profession, the educational level and the level of disease activity. The present study can help the rheumatologist make informed decisions about the patients who may be suitable for a remote evaluation of their disease activity, that can be of particular interest in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Ziade, N.; Al Emadi, S.; Abu Jbara, M.; Saad, S.; Kibbi, L.; Merheb, G.; Badsha, H.; Harifi, G.; Alam, E.; Ayko, A.; Zorkany, B.; Daher, A.; Halabi, H.; Mashaleh, M.; Masri, B.; Messaykeh, J.; Mroue, K.; Salloum, N.; Arayssi, T.",Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases,https://doi.org/10.1136/annrheumdis-2021-eular.646,402

165693,Do Covid-19 patients needing ICU admission have worse 6 months follow up outcomes when compared with hospitalized non-ICU patients? A prospective cohort study,2021-08-20,"Background: In March this year, most of the routine activities were cancelled during the streaming of the pandemic in Italy. This prompted a pragmatic reorganization of the traditional care model of nursing and medicine, to quickly give an efficient clinical response. During the first phase of the pandemic, outpatient visits dropped by more than 60%, forcefully shifting to telemedicine to assure continuity of care despite the lockdown. Objectives: The aim of the present work was to describe the strategy adopted during and immediately after the lockdown to assure the follow up of patients and the maintenance of their treatment in an outpatient “virtual” telemedicine clinic dedicated to RDs. Methods: the patient flow to a rheumatology division during the lockdown was evaluated retrospectively from March to September 2020 in accordance with local restrictions, and three periods are described. Results: 653/913 (71.5%), 542/542 (100%) and 1.048/1.048 (100%) infusion activities scheduled were performed at the centre for daily infusion and pre-infusion assessment, respectively during the 1st, 2nd and 3rd period. In the outpatient clinic during the 1st period, 96.96% of the cases was shifted to Telemedicine, which decreased to 52.45% in the 2nd period;while in the 3rd period, 97.6% of the performances were carried out at the clinic. Diagnostic procedures, such as ultrasound, capillaroscopy, and joint injection were generally postponed during the 1st period, reduced drastically during the 2nd and performed regularly during 3rd period. Ulcer treatment and the Clinical Trial Unit never stopped their activity. The flow of the activity of the outpatient clinic and the day hospital is represented as monthly trends in graph 1 (See Graph 1). Conclusion: Our data show the feasibility of Telemedicine in a lockdown condition. Shifting stable patients to Telemedicine has the potentiality to minimize the risk of contagion and allow continuity of care. In the future, the use of Telemedicine for specific clinical uses might assure patient assistance also in non-pandemic conditions. (Figure Presented).","El Aoufy, K.; Melis, M.

Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) has greatly improved our ability to study these populations, however, major challenges remain, such as accurate identification of intra-host single nucleotide variants (iSNVs) that represent within-host viral diversity of influenza virus. In order to investigate the sources and the frequency of called iSNVs in influenza samples, we used a set of longitudinal influenza patient samples collected within a University of Maryland (UMD) cohort of college students in a living learning community. Our results indicate that technical replicates aid in removal of random RT-PCR, PCR, and platform sequencing errors, while the use of clonal plasmids for removal of systematic errors is more important in samples of low RNA abundance. We show that the choice of reference for read mapping affects the frequency of called iSNVs, with the sample self-reference resulting in the lowest amount of iSNV noise. The importance of variant caller choice is also highlighted in our study, as we observe differential sensitivity of variant callers to the mapping reference choice, as well as the poor overlap of their called iSNVs. Based on this, we develop an approach for identification of highly probable iSNVs by removal of sequencing and bioinformatics algorithm-associated errors, which we implement in phylogenetic analyses of the UMD samples for a greater resolution of transmission links. In addition to identifying closely related transmission connections supported by the presence of highly confident shared iSNVs between patients, our results also indicate that the rate of minor variant turnover within a host may be a limiting factor for utilization of iSNVs to determine patient epidemiological links.","Berry, Irina Maljkovic; Treangen, Todd; Fung, Christian; Tai, Sheldon; Pollett, Simon; Hong, Filbert; Li, Tao; Pireku, Papa; Thomanna, Ashley; German, Jennifer; de Mesquita, P.

166418,Risk factors of COVID-19 confirmed died patients in dr. Kariadi hospital: a retrospective study,2021,"Antibodies raised against highly prevalent human seasonal coronaviruses (sCoVs), which are responsible for the common cold, are known to cross-react with SARS-CoV-2 antigens. This cross-reactivity prompts questions about their protective role against SARS-CoV-2 infections and COVID-19 disease severity. However, the relationship between sCoV exposure and SARS-CoV-2 correlates of protection have not been clearly identified. Here we performed a cross-sectional analysis of cross-reactivity and cross-neutralization to three SARS-CoV-2 antigens using pre-pandemic serum from four different groups: pediatrics and adolescents (<21 yrs of age), persons 21 to 70 yrs of age, persons older than 70 yrs of age, and persons living with HCV or HIV. We find that antibody cross-reactivity to SARS-CoV-2 antigens varied between 1.6% and 15.3% depending on the cohort and the isotype-antigen pair analyzed. We also demonstrate a broad range of neutralizing activity (0-45%) in pre-pandemic serum that interferes with SARS-CoV-2 spike attachment to ACE2. While the abundance of sCoV antibodies did not directly correlate with neutralization efficiency, by using machine learning methodologies, we show that neutralizing activity is rather dependent on the latent variables related to the pattern ratios of sCoVs antibodies presented by each person. These were independent of age or sex, and could be accurately predicted by comparing the relative ratios of IgGs in sera directed to NL63, 229E, HKU-1, and OC43 spike proteins. More specifically, we identified antibodies to NL63 and OC43 as being the two most important predictors of latent variables responsible for protection, and 229E as being the least weighted. Our data support that exposure to sCoVs triggers various cellular and immune responses that influence the efficiency of SARS-CoV-2 spike binding to ACE2, and may impact COVID-19 disease severity through various other latent variables.","Galipeau, Y.; Siragam, V.; Laroche, G.; Marion, E.; Greig, M.; McGuinty, M.; Booth, R.; Durocher, Y.; Cuperlovic-Culf, M.; Bennett, S.

There are multiple defense mechanisms including enzymatic scavengers and non-enzymatic molecules (glutathione and vitamins A, C, D, E, and zinc). Methods: In this observational, cross-sectional, retrospective study, we aimed to describe the clinical behavior of patients hospitalized due to COVID-19 (those treated with a standardized nutritional intervention versus those who received the COVID-19 standard treatment available at the time). A total of 214 medical records of patients hospitalized due to COVID-19 who required nutritional intervention were analyzed. Descriptive analyses of continuous and categorical variables were performed, and an ANOVA test was performed for numerical variables. A logistic regression model and a propensity score matching determined the differences between the matched groups. Findings: 33·6% of the patients were admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU), 28·5% required invasive mechanical ventilation, and the overall mortality was 19·6%. 44·8% of the patients received the standardized nutritional intervention. There were no statistically significant differences between intervention groups, except for the intervention time, in which the standardized nutritional intervention (days) was identified as a protective factor OR=0·550 (p <0·05;CI=0·324-0·936). Conclusions: This is the first study in Colombia to consider a standardized nutritional intervention in patients hospitalized due to COVID-19. Despite not being able to meet the primary objectives, controlled experiments must be carried out to determine the role and possible therapeutic effects of micro and macronutrients in patients with COVID-19.","Sanchez-Pardo, S.; Meza, R.; Gomez, D.; Feria, S.; Ramirez, L.

The effect can be considered universal for all matter and provides analysis in real time. We use this phenomenon to demonstrate the practical possibility to control reactions, occurring between Chicken anemia virus (CAV) and the corresponding antibodies. This methodology can be used for simple but reliable control of similar, otherwise hard to detect, antigen-antibody reactions, in order to confirm the presence of a certain viral species. The approach offers a high level of safety, since it enables measurements to be taken remotely, thus limiting exposure to contagion.

For contextual clustering, three level weights at term level, document level, and corpus level are used with latent semantic analysis. For intelligent topic modeling, semantic collocations using pointwise mutual information (PMI), and log frequency biased mutual dependency (LBMD) are selected, and latent dirichlet allocation is applied. Contextual clustering with latent semantic analysis presents semantic spaces with high correlation in terms at corpus level. Through intelligent topic modeling, topics are improved in the form of lower perplexity and highly coherent.

MaaS has the potential to improve overall efficiency of the transportation system and to decrease use of private automobiles in urban areas, which would decrease CO₂ emissions and pollution and hence support the European Green Deal agenda. The pandemic has caused transport users to change their travel and working routines, transport companies to deliver medicine and food as well as people, and companies to share data that aids governmental responses to the crisis. MaaS operators can optimize transportation infrastructure and efficiency of the transportation system by coordinating mobility supply and demand.

The transcription and replication processes of nsNSVs are catalyzed by a multi-functional RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) complex composed of the large protein (L) and the phosphoprotein (P). Previous studies have shown that the polymerase can adopt a dimeric form, however, the structure of the dimer and how it functions are not understood. Here we determined the cryo-EM structure of hPIV3 L-P complex at 2.7 Å with substantial structural details. A putative catalytic magnesium ion could be built in our structure, and structural comparison revealed atomic features conserved with other RNA viruses. Interactions identified between the two priming and intrusion loops and the connector domain potentially trigger the spatial movement of three C-terminal L domains for different steps of transcription and replication. Structural comparison with other nsNSV RdRps suggests common features of L-P binding. Furthermore, we report for the first time the structural basis of the L-L interaction in the partially modelled dimeric L-P structure, in which the connector domain of one L is positioned at the putative RNA template entry of the other L. Based on these findings, we propose a model by which L dimerization promotes efficient conversion of nascent RNA into a template.","Xie, Jin; Wang, Li; Zhai, Guanglei; Wu, Daitze; Lin, Zhaohu; Wang, Manfu; Yan, Xiaodong; Gao, Lu; Huang, Xinyi; Fearns, Rachel; Chen, Shuai",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.09.13.460081,402

In the face of such threats, geospatial techniques such as GIS, remote sensing, and spatial modelling have proved invaluable tools for archaeological research and cultural heritage monitoring. This paper presents the application of secondary multi-source and multi-temporal geospatial data within a processing framework to provide a comprehensive assessment of geophysical risk to the Roman fort of Magna, Carvoran, UK. An investigation into the ancient hydraulic system at Magna was carried out with analysis of vegetation change over time, and spatio-temporal analysis of soil erosion risk at the site. Due to COVID-19 restrictions in place at the time of this study, these analyses were conducted using only secondary data with the aim to guide further archaeological research, and management and monitoring strategies for the stakeholders involved. Results guided inferences about the ancient hydraulic system, providing insights regarding how to better manage the site at Magna in the future. Analysis of soil erosion allowed the identification of hot spot areas, indicating a future increase in rates of erosion at Magna and suggesting a seasonal period of higher risk of degradation to the site. Results have proven that freely available multi-purpose national-scale datasets are sufficient to create meaningful insights into archaeological sites where physical access to the site is inhibited. This infers the potential to carry out preliminary risk assessment to inform future site management practices. © 2021 by the authors.

First, the economic contraction of business and economic activities. Second, the effect of oil prices dropping as energy demand decreases in the international market. This study seeks to underpin the linkage between GDP growth, oil price, foreign direct investment (FDI), air transport, social globalization and carbon dioxide emission by applying time-series econometrics techniques of the following: fully modified ordinary least squares, dynamic ordinary least squares and canonical tests. The results of the Johansen cointegration test and empirical analysis trace a long-run equilibrium relationship between the highlighted variables. Our study shows that a 1% increase in FDI attraction increases economic growth by 0.004%;similarly, air transport and oil rent from KSA increased economic growth by 0.547% and 0.005%, respectively. These outcomes are indicative of the GDP growth ambition of the KSA economy in order to intensify FDI attraction and the air transportation sector. However, we also observe that increases in CO2 emission increase GDP growth. Thus, this suggests that the economic growth in KSA is not green, indicating the need for green economic growth pursuit targets.","Agboola, Mary Oluwatoyin Bekun Festus Victor Balsalobre-Lorente Daniel",Sustainability,https://doi.org/10.3390/su13169476,402

179071,The severity of symptoms and outcomes of patients admitted with rheumatic diseases and COVID-19;a prospective cohort study in Iran,2021,"Introduction: Optic neuritis or inflammation of the optic nerve is a frequent cause of acute optic nerve damage in children and adults. Optic neuritis can occur in association with some viruses, such as influenza and mumps viruses. At the end of 2019, a novel coronavirus, known as COVID-19, spread throughout the world. Coronavirus is known to cause optic neuritis in animal models, and several adult cases have been reported up to now, as well. However, to date, no case of optic neuritis has been reported in children with COVID-19. Case Presentation: The patient was an eight-year-old boy referred to our center, complaining of sudden bilateral and progressive blurring of vision with right-eye preference. He had a history of severe headache for three days in the previous two weeks and slight mood disturbance. On physical examination, bilateral disk swelling and significant loss of vision were detected in his both eyes. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain showed bilateral maxillary sinus thickening with mild optic nerves enlargement with slightly hyperintense T2 and mild post-contrast enhancement. No pathologic finding was seen in the brain, and cerebrospinal fluid and other immunologic tests were normal. Due to the patient’s history of headache and outbreak of COVID-19, a nasopharyn-geal reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test for COVID-19 was requested, and a positive result was obtained, confirming the diagnosis of COVID-19 infection. The optic neuritis was treated with pulsed methylprednisolone and the patients’ vision improved. Conclusions: In this article, we reported an eight-year-old child with optic neuritis and headache in the context of COVID-19. No case of optic neuritis has been reported in children with COVID-19. © 2021, Author(s).","Eslamiyeh, H.; Jafari, M.",Iranian Journal of Pediatrics,https://doi.org/10.5812/ijp.111798,402

Invasive blood-sampling and laboratory access are often required, and measurements provide a static profile at each instance. We conducted a Phase I clinical study validating performance of a microneedle patch for minimally-invasive, continuous lactate measurement in healthy volunteers. Methods Five healthy adult participants wore a solid microneedle biosensor on their forearms and undertook aerobic exercise for 30 minutes. The microneedle biosensor quantifies lactate concentrations in interstitial fluid (ISF) within the dermis continuously and in real-time. Outputs were captured as sensor current and compared with lactate concentrations from venous blood and microdialysis. Results The biosensor was well-tolerated. Participants generated a median peak venous lactate of 9.25 mmol/L (Interquartile range, 6.73 to 10.71). Microdialysate concentrations of lactate closely correlated with blood. Microneedle biosensor current followed venous lactate concentrations and dynamics, with good agreement seen in all participants. There was an estimated lag-time of 5 minutes (IQR -4 to 11 minutes) between microneedle and blood lactate measurements. Conclusion This study provides first-in-human data on use of a minimally-invasive microneedle biosensor for continuous lactate measurement, providing dynamic monitoring. The platform offers distinct advantages to frequent blood sampling in a wide range of clinical settings, especially where access to laboratory services is limited or blood sampling is infeasible.","Ming, D.

In this study, we present the first estimates of these rates using multi-country serology studies, together with public data on hospital admissions and mortality. Our results show that the risk of severe and critical disease increases exponentially with age, but much less steeply than the risk of fatal illness. Importantly, the estimated rate of severe disease outcome in adolescents is an order of magnitude larger than the reported rate of vaccine side-effects; thus, showing how these estimates are relevant for health policy. Finally, we validate our results by showing that they are in close agreement with the estimates obtained from an indirect method that uses reported infection fatality rates estimates and hospital mortality data.","Herrera-Esposito, D.; de los Campos, G.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.07.29.21261282v1?rss=1,402

191056,"Vitamin D, Covid-19 and Children.",2020-04-03,"BACKGROUND Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) for chronic total occlusion (CTO) is challenging and has been associated with low success rates. However, recent advancements in equipment and the flexibility to switch between multiple technical approaches during the same procedure (""hybrid"" percutaneous algorithm) have dramatically increased the success of CTO-PCI. We sought to compare the contemporary procedural outcomes of hybrid CTO-PCI with previously published CTO-PCI studies. METHODS The procedural outcomes of 497 consecutive CTO-PCIs performed between January 2012 and August 2013 at five high-volume centers in the United States were compared with the pooled success and complication rates reported in 39 prior CTO-PCI series that included ≥100 patients and were published after 2000. RESULTS The baseline clinical and angiographic characteristics of the study patients were comparable to those of previous studies. Technical and procedural success was achieved in 455 cases (91.5%) and 451 cases (90.7%), respectively, and were significantly higher than the pooled technical and procedural success rates from prior studies (76.5%, P<.001 and 75.2%, P<.001, respectively). Major procedural complications occurred in 9/497 patients (1.8%) overall and included death (2 patients), acute myocardial infarction (5 patients), repeat target vessel PCI (1 patient), and tamponade requiring pericardiocentesis (2 patients). The incidence of major complications was similar to that of prior studies (pooled rate 2.0%; P=.72). CONCLUSION Use of the hybrid approach to CTO-PCI is associated with higher success and similar complication rates compared to prior studies, supporting its expanded use for treating these challenging lesions.","Christopoulos, Georgios; Menon, Rohan V; Karmpaliotis, Dimitri; Alaswad, Khaldoon; Lombardi, William; Grantham, Aaron; Patel, Vishal G; Rangan, Bavana V; Kotsia, Anna P; Lembo, Nicholas; Kandzari, David; Carlson, Harold; Garcia, Santiago; Banerjee, Subhash; Thompson, Craig A; Brilakis, Emmanouil S",The Journal of invasive cardiology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25198485/,402

A histidine-tagged form of this protein, HEL, was expressed using baculovirus vectors in insect cells. The purified recombinant protein had in vitro ATPase activity that was strongly stimulated by poly(U), poly(dT), poly(C), and poly(dA), but not by poly(G). The recombinant protein also had both RNA and DNA duplex-unwinding activities with 5'-to-3' polarity. The DNA helicase activity of the enzyme preferentially unwound 5'-oligopyrimidine-tailed, partial-duplex substrates and required a tail length of at least 10 nucleotides for effective unwinding.

In this study 500 stool specimens taken from 1996 to 1998 from children with acute diarrhea in Buenos Aires were examined. Group A rotavirus was unequivocally demonstrated in 62% of the samples tested by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for detection of VP6 antigen, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of double-stranded RNA, and reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) for amplification of the VP7:G (1, 062 bp) and VP4:P (876 bp) genes. Only five positive specimens were found by RT-PCR but not by ELISA. G and P typing was carried out by nested amplification of variable sequences of the VP7 and the VP4 genes with six G- and five P-type-specific primers (multiplex PCR). Results obtained by this method showed the prevalence of the following G and P types: G1, 39%; G2, 43%; G4, 4%; P[8], 16%; P[4], 71%. Unexpectedly, the G-P type combination most frequently found was G2P[4] (43%) rather than G1P[8] (12%), which is the most commonly found worldwide. Unusual strains of the type G1P[4] accounted for 14% of the total, while mixed infections with more than one type were found in 10% of the samples. Detection of fecal rotavirus-specific immunoglobulin M (IgM) and IgA antibodies in consecutive samples of two patients taken at daily intervals demonstrated that high levels of IgM and IgA antibodies were detected on day 1 after the onset of disease and that the samples remained positive for about 10 days, after which virus shedding was no longer observed. Multiplex PCR offers a sensitive and specific alternative to determine the prevalence of group A rotavirus G and P types and to identify the emergence of uncommon strains, whereas detection of fecal IgM and IgA antibodies represents a useful supplement to virus detection for the diagnosis of current or recently acquired infections.","Argüelles, M H; Villegas, G A; Castello, A; Abrami, A; Ghiringhelli, P D; Semorile, L; Glikmann, G",Journal of clinical microbiology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10618096/,402

Then, to evaluate the usefulness of the S1 genotype-specific RT-PCR, we examined the relationship between S1 genotypes and serotypes of IBV in Japan. Sequencing of the S1 genes of IBV and phylogenetic tree analysis were conducted. On the basis of the sequencing data of the S1 genotype samples, we determined primer sets specific for each genotype. Five vaccine strains in Japan as reference strains and 46 field isolates were classified into different genetic clusters by phylogenetic tree analysis (JP-1, JP-II, JP-III, Mass and 4/91) and were matched to the results of S1 genotype-specific RT-PCR. A cross virus-neutralizing test showed that the five vaccine strains in Japan exhibited different serotypes from each other. The concordance rate of the 46 field isolates between the S1 genotypes and serotypes was 65.2%. The present study indicates that genotype-specific RT-PCR could be a convenient and useful tool for determining IBV serotypes and could contribute to the control of IBV outbreaks in Japan.","Ariyoshi, Rikako; Kawai, Toru; Honda, Takashi; Tokiyoshi, Sachio",The Journal of veterinary medical science,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20093802/,402

203420,The clinical characteristics and prognosis of COVID-19 patients with comorbidities: a retrospective analysis of the infection peak in Wuhan,2021,"BACKGROUND: The cerebellum plays an important role in the neural mechanism of depression and its static functional connectivity (FC) with the cerebrum is disrupted in patients with major depressive disorder (MDD). However, cerebellar-cerebral dynamic FC alterations in MDD remain largely unknown. METHODS: 50 patients with MDD and 36 well-matched healthy controls underwent resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging. Cerebellar-cerebral dynamic FC analyses were performed using the cerebellar seeds previously identified as being involved in the executive, default-mode, affective-limbic, and motor networks. Inter-group differences in the cerebellar dynamic FC and their associations with clinical and cognitive variables were examined. RESULTS: Compared to healthy controls, patients with MDD had decreased cerebellar-cerebral dynamic FC of the cerebellar subregions connecting with the executive, default-mode and affective-limbic networks. The dynamic FC of the cerebellar subregion connecting with the affective-limbic network was related to severity of depression and anxiety symptoms in MDD patients. The dynamic FC of the cerebellar subregions connecting with the default-mode and affective-limbic networks were related to sustained attention and prospective memory in controls, while the correlations were inverse or non-significant in patients. LIMITATIONS: The fairly modest sample size and potential medication effect may increase the instability of the results. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings provide further evidence for the pivotal role of the cerebellum in the neuropathology of depression, pointing to potential targets of cerebellar-cerebral pathways for alternative intervention or monitoring therapeutic responses.","Zhu, Dao-Min; Yang, Ying; Zhang, Yu; Wang, Chunli; Wang, Yajun; Zhang, Cun; Zhao, Wenming; Zhu, Jiajia",J Affect Disord,,402

204791,Liver Dysfunction and Its Association with the Risk of Death in COVID-19 Patients: A Prospective Cohort Study,2020,"The COVID-19 pandemic continues to affect leisure mobilities globally. In Australia, the pandemic has radically influenced the mobilities of domestic tourists, with travellers subjected to dynamic and intermittent restrictions on both intrastate and interstate movement since March, 2020. This paper reports on the findings of a study conducted between June and July 2020 that explored Australians’ intentions to participate in tourism as COVID-19 leisure travel restrictions eased. It reveals that the participants sought to shift from modes of transport that involve high risks of exposure to other tourists, including cruise ships and air travel, to private, smaller-scale forms of leisure mobility such as cars and campervans. The paper draws from this trend to offer recommendations that champion both the experiential qualities of tourist automobilities and the positioning of private vehicles as temporary facilitators of safer mobilities that may also support wellbeing. These recommendations are afforded additional significance by the opportunities they imply for the stimulation of regional tourism economies severely affected by the unstable and volatile mobilities of the COVID-19 pandemic.

212288,Hydroxychloroquine use in hospitalised patients with COVID-19: An observational matched cohort study,2020,"BACKGROUND: With the advent of whole exome (ES) and genome sequencing (GS) as tools for disease gene discovery, rare variant filtering, prioritization and data sharing have become essential components of the search for disease genes and variants potentially contributing to disease phenotypes. The computational storage, data manipulation, and bioinformatic interpretation of thousands to millions of variants identified in ES and GS, respectively, is a challenging task. To aid in that endeavor, we constructed PhenoDB, GeneMatcher and VariantMatcher. RESULTS: PhenoDB is an accessible, freely available, web-based platform that allows users to store, share, analyze and interpret their patients' phenotypes and variants from ES/GS data. GeneMatcher is accessible to all stakeholders as a web-based tool developed to connect individuals (researchers, clinicians, health care providers and patients) around the globe with interest in the same gene(s), variant(s) or phenotype(s). Finally, VariantMatcher was developed to enable public sharing of variant-level data and phenotypic information from individuals sequenced as part of multiple disease gene discovery projects. Here we provide updates on PhenoDB and GeneMatcher applications and implementation and introduce VariantMatcher. CONCLUSION: Each of these tools has facilitated worldwide data sharing and data analysis and improved our ability to connect genes to phenotypic traits. Further development of these platforms will expand variant analysis, interpretation, novel disease-gene discovery and facilitate functional annotation of the human genome for clinical genomics implementation and the precision medicine initiative.","Wohler, Elizabeth; Martin, Renan; Griffith, Sean; Rodrigues, Eliete da S; Antonescu, Corina; Posey, Jennifer E; Coban-Akdemir, Zeynep; Jhangiani, Shalini N; Doheny, Kimberly F; Lupski, James R; Valle, David; Hamosh, Ada; Sobreira, Nara",Orphanet J Rare Dis,,402
212289,Hydroxychloroquine use in hospitalised patients with COVID-19: An observational matched cohort study,2020,"Black, Latinx, and Indigenous people have contracted the SARS-CoV-2 virus and died of COVID-19 at higher rates than White people. Individuals rated public transit, taxis, and ride-hailing as the modes of transportation putting them at greatest risk of COVID-19 infection. Cycling may thus be an attractive alternative for commuting. Amid the increase in bikeshare usage during the early months of the pandemic, bikeshare companies made changes to membership requirements to increase accessibility, targeting especially essential workers. Essential workers in the United States are disproportionately Black and Latinx, underpaid, and reliant on public transit to commute to work. We document changes made by bikeshare companies, including benefits to various groups of essential workers, and we discuss such changes in the context of longstanding racial disparities in bikeshare access. While well intended, the arbitrary delineation in eligibility for such benefits by class of essential workers unwittingly curtailed access for many who may have benefited most. Given that equity in bikeshare is an important tool to improve access to safe transportation, critical changes in the distribution, accessibility, and usability of bikeshare networks is essential. Bikeshare companies, city planners, and policy makers should collaborate with community-based bike advocates to implement changes, as vocalized by those most in need of alternative forms of transportation.","Tiako, M.

214136,Factors associated with non-optimal resource utilization of air ambulance for interfacility transfer of injured patients,2020,"Objectives: We investigated the time course of clinical response in the Treatment of Early Onset Schizophrenia Spectrum Disorders Study (TEOSS). Methods: TEOSS randomized 119 predominantly outpatient youth ages 8-19 years with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder to 8 weeks of treatment with molindone, risperidone, or olanzapine. We used proportional hazards regression to determine whether these three antipsychotics differed in the time until clinical response, defined as the time from treatment initiation to the point of achieving a Clinical Global Impressions-Improvement (CGI-I) scale score of 1 (""very much improved"") or 2 (""much improved"") that was maintained until week 8. Results: Of the 116 youth who initiated treatment, 56 (48%) achieved clinical response. Among clinical responders, the median (±interquartile range) time until clinical response was 4.0 (±4.0) weeks for olanzapine, 4.5 (±4.0) weeks for risperidone, and 6.0 (±4.0) weeks for molindone. There were no significant differences in time course for clinical response between medications (p = 0.84). Youth without symptom improvement (CGI-I &#8805; 4) after 3 weeks were more likely to be clinical nonresponders at week 8 (relative risk ratio = 1.98, 95% confidence interval 1.29-3.05), compared with youth with at-least-minimal symptom improvement after 3 weeks when looking at all antipsychotics combined. Conclusion: To our knowledge, our study is the first to investigate medication differences in treatment response timing in early onset schizophrenia spectrum disorders. Clinical response times for molindone, risperidone, and olanzapine were not significantly different. Furthermore, while lack of early improvement predicted clinical nonresponse, whether or not to continue antipsychotic treatment after 3 or more weeks without symptom improvement should be based on clinical judgment after weighing potential risks, benefits, and alternatives.

But is science up to the task? This is far from self-evident. The demands on science in times of crisis run counter to the values of good, normal science. Crisis science needs to be fast, univocal, personalized, and direct, while normal science is slow, contentious, collective, and sensitive to complexity. Science can only play its atypical role if it is staged in the public arena. Some patterns of staging stand out: personalization, visualization, and connection to lived experiences. So far, the staging of science has been successful, but it is fragile. The COVID-19 crisis shows the potential of well-staged forms of alliance between science and policy, but when the general assumption is that scientists will ""solve"" societal ""problems,"" the staging of science has gone too far.","Van Dooren, Wouter; Noordegraaf, Mirko",PAR.

214441,Successful heart transplantation for COVID-19-associated post-infectious fulminant myocarditis,2021,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) induces a wide range of disease severity, ranging from asymptomatic infection to a life-threating illness, particularly in the elderly population and persons with comorbid conditions. Among those persons with serious coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) disease, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a common and often fatal presentation. Animal models of SARS-CoV-2 infection that manifest severe disease are needed to investigate the pathogenesis of COVID-19-induced ARDS and evaluate therapeutic strategies. We report two cases of ARDS in two aged African green monkeys (AGMs) infected with SARS-CoV-2 that had pathological lesions and disease similar to severe COVID-19 in humans. We also report a comparatively mild COVID-19 phenotype characterized by minor clinical, radiographic, and histopathologic changes in the two surviving, aged AGMs and four rhesus macaques (RMs) infected with SARS-CoV-2. We found notable increases in circulating cytokines in three of four infected, aged AGMs but not in infected RMs. All the AGMs had increased levels of plasma IL-6 compared with baseline, a predictive marker and presumptive therapeutic target in humans infected with SARS-CoV-2. Together, our results indicate that both RMs and AGMs are capable of modeling SARS-CoV-2 infection and suggest that aged AGMs may be useful for modeling severe disease manifestations, including ARDS.","Blair, Robert V; Vaccari, Monica; Doyle-Meyers, Lara A; Roy, Chad J; Russell-Lodrigue, Kasi; Fahlberg, Marissa; Monjure, Chris J; Beddingfield, Brandon; Plante, Kenneth S; Plante, Jessica A; Weaver, Scott C; Qin, Xuebin; Midkiff, Cecily C; Lehmicke, Gabrielle; Golden, Nadia; Threeton, Breanna; Penney, Toni; Allers, Carolina; Barnes, Mary B; Pattison, Melissa; Datta, Prasun K; Maness, Nicholas J; Birnbaum, Angela; Fischer, Tracy; Bohm, Rudolf P; Rappaport, Jay",Am. j. pathol,,402

A study based on meta­analysis data,2020,"The worldwide, extraordinary outbreak of coronavirus pandemic (i.e., COVID-19) and other emerging viral expansions have drawn particular interest to the design and development of novel antiviral, and viricidal, agents, with a broad-spectrum of antiviral activity. The current indispensable challenge lies in the development of universal virus repudiation systems that are reusable, and capable of inactivating pathogens, thus reducing risk of infection and transmission. In this review, science-based methods, mechanisms, and procedures, which are implemented in obtaining resultant antiviral coated substrates, used in the destruction of the strains of the different viruses, are reviewed. The constituent antiviral members are classified into a few broad groups, such as polymeric materials, metal ions/metal oxides, and functional nanomaterials, based on the type of materials used at the virus contamination sites. The action mode against enveloped viruses was depicted to vindicate the antiviral mechanism. We also disclose hypothesized strategies for development of a universal and reusable virus deactivation system against the emerging COVID-19. In the surge of the current, alarming scenario of SARS-CoV-2 infections, there is a great necessity for developing highly-innovative antiviral agents to work against the viruses. We hypothesize that some of the antiviral coatings discussed here could exert an inhibitive effect on COVID-19, indicated by the results that the coatings succeeded in obtaining against other enveloped viruses. Consequently, the coatings need to be tested and authenticated, to fabricate a wide range of coated antiviral products such as masks, gowns, surgical drapes, textiles, high-touch surfaces, and other personal protective equipment, aimed at extrication from the COVID-19 pandemic.","Pemmada, Rakesh; Zhu, Xiaoxian; Dash, Madhusmita; Zhou, Yubin; Ramakrishna, Seeram; Peng, Xinsheng; Thomas, Vinoy; Jain, Sanjeev; Nanda, Himansu Sekhar",,,402

Such difference encompasses practices of racialisation and racism, healthcare austerity, the circulation of capital, border-making, intervention into non-human nature, wildlife trade bans, anthropocentrism, and the exploitation of animal test subjects. The contributions highlight how COVID-19 provides a needed opportunity to unite new materialist and anti-racist, anti-colonial scholarship as well as reimagine more radically sustainable multispecies futures.

217284,Evaluation and improvement of the National Early Warning Score (NEWS2) for COVID-19: a multi-hospital study,2021,"BACKGROUND: The number of deaths attributable to COVID-19 in Spain has been highly controversial since it is problematic to tell apart deaths having COVID as the main cause from those provoked by the aggravation by the viral infection of other underlying health problems. In addition, overburdening of health system led to an increase in mortality due to the scarcity of adequate medical care, at the same time confinement measures could have contributed to the decrease in mortality from certain causes. Our aim is to compare the number of deaths observed in 2020 with the projection for the same period obtained from a sequence of previous years. Thus, this computed mortality excess could be considered as the real impact of the COVID-19 on the mortality rates. METHODS: The population was split into four age groups, namely: (< 50; 50-64; 65-74; 75 and over). For each one, a projection of the death numbers for the year 2020, based on the interval 2008-2020, was estimated using a Bayesian spatio-temporal model. In each one, spatial, sex, and year effects were included. In addition, a specific effect of the year 2020 was added (""outbreak""). Finally, the excess deaths in year 2020 were estimated as the count of observed deaths minus those projected. RESULTS: The projected death number for 2020 was 426,970 people, the actual count being 499,104; thus, the total excess of deaths was 72,134. However, this increase was very unequally distributed over the Spanish regions. CONCLUSION: Bayesian spatio-temporal models have proved to be a useful tool for estimating the impact of COVID-19 on mortality in Spain in 2020, making it possible to assess how the disease has affected different age groups accounting for effects of sex, spatial variation between regions and time trend over the last few years.","Saavedra, Pedro; Santana, Angelo; Bello, Luis; Pacheco, José-Miguel; Sanjuán, Esther",Popul Health Metr,,402

This meta-analysis is to evaluate the prevalence of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) in COVID-19 patients and to determine the association of DIC with the severity and prognosis of COVID-19. METHODS: We searched the PubMed, EMBASE, and China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) database until August 12, 2020. The meta-analysis was performed using Stata 16.0 software. RESULTS: 14 studies were included in our meta-analysis. The pooled analysis revealed that the incidence of COVID-19 patients developing DIC was 3% (95%: 1%-5%, P < 0.001). In addition, deaths were more likely to be associated with DIC (Log OR = 2.46, 95% CI: 0.94-3.99, P < 0.001) with statistical significance. CONCLUSIONS: DIC is associated with the severity and poor prognosis of COVID-19 patients. Therefore, attention should be paid to coagulation dysfunction in COVID-19 patients. Monitoring of coagulation indicators may improve the prognosis of COVID-19 inpatients.","Zhou, Xianghui; Cheng, Zhipeng; Luo, Lili; Zhu, Ying; Lin, Wenyi; Ming, Zhangyin; Chen, Wei; Hu, Yu",Thromb Res,,402

Given this, the COVID-19 pandemic has led to concern about how stress due to the pandemic will affect children's development and mental health. Although early life stress has been linked to altered functioning of a number of neural and biological systems, there is a wide range of variability in children's outcomes. The mechanisms that influence these individual differences are still not well understood. In the past, studies of stress in childhood focused on the type of events that children encountered in their lives. We conducted a review of the literature to formulate a new perspective on the effects of early life stress on development. This new, topological model, may increase understanding of the potential effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on children's development. This model is oriented on children's perceptions of their environment and their social relationships, rather than specific events. These factors influence central and peripheral nervous system development, changing how children interpret, adapt, and respond to potentially stressful events, with implications for children's mental and physical health outcomes.","Smith, Karen E; Pollak, Seth D",Cognitive affect. behav. neurosci.

225729,Suggestions to Prepare for the Second Epidemic of COVID-19 in Korea,2020,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To review the current state of knowledge on the newly proposed COVID Stress Syndrome. RECENT FINDINGS: The syndrome consists of five inter-correlated elements: (a) fear of SARSCoV2 infection and fear of coming into contact with objects or surfaces contaminated with the coronavirus; (b) fear of socio-economic impacts of the pandemic; (c) fear of foreigners for fear that they are infected; (d) pandemic-related compulsive checking and reassurance-seeking; and (e) pandemic-related traumatic stress symptoms. A severe form of the syndrome, characterized by clinically significant distress and impairment in functioning, is the COVID Stress Disorder, which is regarded as a pandemic-related adjustment disorder. Several treatment options exist but further research is needed. Research during the COVID-19 pandemic has identified a pandemic-related adjustment disorder. The diagnosis of COVID Stress Syndrome should be made only after ruling out other disorders that could potentially account for the pattern of symptoms, such as obsessive-compulsive disorder and posttraumatic stress disorder. Further studies are needed to investigate the long-term course of the syndrome. Similar adjustment disorders may arise in future pandemics. Accordingly, understanding the COVID Stress Syndrome may facilitate efforts to understand and treat psychopathology in future pandemics.","Taylor, Steven",Curr Psychiatry Rep,,402

A Systematic Review,2021,"BACKGROUND: When it comes to critical early post-acute TIA/stroke phase, there is a lack of a comprehensive multi-parametric telemonitoring system. The COVID-19 emergency, its related global mobility restrictions and fear of hospitalization further highlighted the need of a comprehensive solution. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to design and test a pragmatic e-Health system based on multiparametric telemonitoring to support of TIA/stroke patients in sub-acute phase during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: We proposed a telemonitoring system and protocol for TIA/minor stroke patients during COVID-19 pandemic for patients at risk of stroke recurrence. This system involves the use of portable devices for BP/HR/SpO2/temperature sensing, panic-button, gateway, and a dedicated ICT platform. The protocol is a 14-day multiparametric telemonitoring, therapy, and emergency intervention based on vital sign alteration notifications. We conducted a proof-of-concept validation test on 8 TIA/minor stroke patients in the early post-acute phase (< 14 days from ischemic event). RESULTS: The proposed solution allowed to promptly and remotely identify vital sign alterations at home during the early post-acute phase, allowing therapy and behavioral intervention adjustments. Also, we observed a significant improvement of quality of life, as well as a significant reduction of anxiety and depression status. TUQ showed ease of use, good interface quality and high user satisfaction of the proposed solution. The 3-month follow-up showed total adherence of prescribed therapy and no stroke/TIA recurrence or other emergency department admissions. CONCLUSION: The proposed e-Health solution and telemonitoring protocol may be highly useful for early post-acute remote patient management, thus supporting constant monitoring and patient adherence to the treatment pathway, especially during the COVID-19 emergency.","Ajcevic, Milos; Furlanis, Giovanni; Naccarato, Marcello; Caruso, Paola; Polverino, Paola; Marsich, Alessandro; Accardo, Agostino; Manganotti, Paolo",Int J Med Inform,,402

Some of these people developed mental health problems, and many solutions have been put in place to address the mental health issues of patients and health professionals affected by the disease. However, not much attention has been given to students, particularly those from medical school. The present study aims to conduct an online survey to investigate the mental health status of students from a medical college in Hubei province. Materials and Methods: The WeChat-based survey program Questionnaire Star, which contained questions from Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) and Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7), was utilized for the present study. Results: A total of 217 students participated in the survey. Among these students, 127 were female and 90 were male. Furthermore, 77 students (35.5%) who participated in the survey were in a state of depression, and 48 (22.1%) were in a state of anxiety. The majority of students who were in depressed (n=75) or anxiety (n=46) states had mild or moderate states. There were no significant differences in students in terms of gender, geographical location, and grade, for the prevalence of depression and anxiety.

This assembly can result in the production of constructs that are targeted to a specific site or cell type in order to enhance the response to, or activity of, the conjugated moiety. In the case of cancer treatments, selectively targeting chemotherapies to the cells of interest limit harmful side effects and enhance efficacy. Targeting through conjugation is also advantageous in delivering treatments to difficult-to-reach tissues, such as the brain or infections deep in the lung. Bacterial infections can be more selectively treated by conjugating antibiotics to microbe-specific entities; helping to avoid antibiotic resistance across commensal bacterial species. In the case of vaccine development, conjugation is used to enhance efficacy without compromising safety.

Datasets of these genomes assembled from multiple hospitals can give critical clues to regional or national trends in infection. Herein, we report a lineage summary based on data collected from hospitals located in the Tokyo metropolitan area. We performed SARS-CoV-2 whole-genome sequencing of specimens from 198 patients with COVID-19 at 13 collaborating hospitals located in the Kanto region. Phylogenetic analysis and fingerprinting of the nucleotide substitutions were performed to differentiate and classify the viral lineages. More than 90% of the identified strains belonged to Clade 20B, which has been prevalent in European countries since March 2020. Only two lineages (B.1.1.284 and B.1.1.214) were found to be predominant in Japan. However, one sample from a COVID-19 patient admitted to a hospital in the Kanto region in November 2020 belonged to the B.1.346 lineage of Clade 20C, which has been prevalent in the western United States since November 2020. The patient had no history of overseas travel or any known contact with anyone who had travelled abroad. Consequently, the Clade 20C strain belonging to the B.1.346 lineage appeared likely to have been imported from the western United States to Japan across the strict quarantine barrier. B.1.1.284 and B.1.1.214 lineages were found to be predominant in the Kanto region, but a single case of the B.1.346 lineage of clade 20C, probably imported from the western United States, was also identified. These results illustrate that a decentralized network of hospitals offers significant advantages as a highly responsive system for monitoring regional molecular epidemiologic trends.","Abe, Kodai; Shimura, Takako; Takenouchi, Toshiki; Iwasaki, Yuka W; Ishizu, Hirotsugu; Uwamino, Yoshifumi; Uno, Shunsuke; Gotoh, Jun; Tachikawa, Natsuo; Takeuchi, Yuriko; Katayama, Junpei; Nozaki, Hiroyuki; Fujii, Susumu; Seki, Shikou; Nakamura, Morio; Uda, Kazuhiro; Misumi, Takahiko; Ishihara, Jun; Yamada, Kenichiro; Kanai, Toshio; Murai, Shinji; Araki, Kazuhiro; Ebihara, Tamotsu; Siomi, Haruhiko; Hasegawa, Naoki; Kitagawa, Yuko; Amagai, Masayuki; Suematsu, Makoto; Kosaki, Kenjiro",Keio j. med,,402

Searching for evidence from a new disease,2020,"BACKGROUND: As part of the SARS-CoV­2 pandemic, the district of Heinsberg developed into an infectiological epicentre for Germany in February 2020. Our hospital, which is located in the immediate vicinity, reacted very quickly in addition to adapting patient care by implementing an organizational structure for recording SARS-CoV-2-positive employees, patients and their contact persons. OBJECTIVES: The infections recorded in contact tracing were analysed and, based on an exemplary outbreak, infection chains and follow-up processes were evaluated. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Comprehensive data on contact types, oropharyngeal swab results for SARS-CoV­2 and quarantine days were documented and retrospectively evaluated using a self-developed database. RESULTS: Of the 568 employees recorded by in-house contact tracing, 32 employees (1.2%, nâ¯= 2567) were detected as SARS-CoV­2 positive. Of those, 50% (nâ¯= 16) tested positive due to contact tracing, 15.6% (nâ¯= 5) were recorded by routine smears and 34.4% (nâ¯= 11) were returning travellers. The variable PCR results of the control smears from these positive employees were noticeable. In 18.8% (nâ¯= 6) of the initially negative control smears, positive PCR results were found in the following control smear. The inhouse contact tracing team was able to detect infection clusters on non-COVID-19 wards at an early stage and, together with clinical hygiene and the public health department, initiated comprehensive measures to limit the spread of the virus. Infection chains could thus be interrupted. CONCLUSION: The work of the clinic's own contact tracing unit has proven to be an essential part of clinical pandemic management not least against the background of new waves of infection and is indispensable for the detection of local infection clusters.","Quacken, Florian; Greiffendorf, Ingo; Ropertz, Susanne; Peters, David; Bergrath, Sebastian; Aretz, Sabine; Lahm, Andreas; Pesch, Alexander; Wimmer-Dahmen, Marie-Luise; Graeven, Ullrich",Bundesgesundheitsblatt Gesundheitsforschung Gesundheitsschutz,,402

In addition, existing guidelines including those by Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India, and articles from several non-academic sources (e.g. news websites etc.) were accessed. RESULTS: While the nationwide lockdown has resulted in financial losses and has affected all segments of society, the domino effect on health, healthcare and nutrition could possibly pose major setbacks to previously gained successes of National health programs. CONCLUSION: Apart from firm economic measures, all National Health Programs should be re-strengthened to avert possible surge of communicable (apart from COVID19) and non-communicable diseases. These efforts should be focussed on population belonging to low SES.","Gopalan, Hema S; Misra, Anoop",Diabetes Metab Syndr,,402

Many such models also include Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) networks, a common tool for time series forecasting. In this work, we further investigate the integration of these two methods by implementing GNNs within the gates of an LSTM and exploiting spatial information. In addition, we introduce a skip connection which proves critical to jointly capture the spatial and temporal patterns in the data. We validate our daily COVID-19 new cases forecast model on data of 37 European nations for the last 472 days and show superior performance compared to state-of-the-art graph time series models based on mean absolute scaled error (MASE).

Guidelines for tracheotomy in this cohort of patients are therefore required with assessed outcomes of tracheotomies. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A retrospective chart review was performed of COVID-19 patients undergoing tracheotomy. Inclusion criteria were the performance of a tracheotomy in COVID-19 positive patients between March 11 and December 31, 2020. Exclusion criteria were lack of consent, extubation prior to the performance of a tracheotomy, death prior to the performance of the tracheotomy, and COVID-19 patients undergoing tracheotomy who tested negative twice after medical treatment. The primary predictor variable was the performance of a tracheotomy in COVID-19 positive patients and the primary outcome variable was the time to cessation of mechanical ventilation with the institution of supplemental oxygen via trach mask. RESULTS: Seventeen tracheotomies were performed between 4-25 days following intubation (meanâ¯=â¯17 days). Seven patients died between 4 and 16 days (meanâ¯=â¯8.7 days) following tracheotomy and 10 living patients realized cessation of mechanical ventilation from 4 hours to 61 days following tracheotomy (meanâ¯=â¯19.3 days). These patients underwent tracheotomy between 4 and 22 days following intubation (meanâ¯=â¯14 days). The 7 patients who died following tracheotomy underwent the procedure between 7 and 25 days following intubation (meanâ¯=â¯18.2 days). Seven patients underwent tracheotomy on or after 20 days of intubation and 3 survived (43%). Ten patients underwent tracheotomy before 20 days of intubation and 7 patients survived (70%). Significant differences between the mortality groups were detected for age (Pâ¯=â¯.006), and for P/F ratio at time of consult (Pâ¯=â¯.047) and the time of tracheotomy (Pâ¯=â¯.03). CONCLUSIONS: Tracheotomies are safely performed in COVID-19 patients with a standardized protocol. The timing of tracheotomy in COVID-19 patients is based on ventilator parameters, P/F ratio, patient prognosis, patient advanced directives, and family wishes.","Carlson, Eric R; Heidel, R Eric; Houston, Kyle; Vahdani, Soheil; Winstead, Michael",J. oral maxillofac. surg,,402
233491,Validity and reliability of the Italian version of the cardiac quality of life questionnaire for pediatric patients with heart disease (PedsQLTM),2021,"We review concepts involved in describing the chemodynamic features of nanoparticles and apply the framework to gain physicochemical insights into interactions between SARS-CoV-2 virions and airborne particulate matter (PM). Our analysis is highly pertinent given that the World Health Organisation acknowledges that SARS-CoV-2 may be transmitted by respiratory droplets, and the US Center for Disease Control and Prevention recognises that airborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2 can occur. In our theoretical treatment, the virion is assimilated to a core-shell nanoparticle, and contributions of various interaction energies to the virion-PM association (electrostatic, hydrophobic, London-van der Waals, etc.) are generically included. We review the limited available literature on the physicochemical features of the SARS-CoV-2 virion and identify knowledge gaps. Despite the lack of quantitative data, our conceptual framework qualitatively predicts that virion-PM entities are largely able to maintain equilibrium on the timescale of their diffusion towards the host cell surface. Comparison of the relevant mass transport coefficients reveals that virion biointernalization demand by alveolar host cells may be greater than the diffusive supply. Under such conditions both the free and PM-sorbed virions may contribute to the transmitted dose. This result points to the potential for PM to serve as a shuttle for delivery of virions to host cell targets. Thus, our critical review reveals that the chemodynamics of virion-PM interactions may play a crucial role in the transmission of COVID-19, and provides a sound basis for explaining reported correlations between episodes of air pollution and outbreaks of COVID-19.","Duval, Jérôme F L; van Leeuwen, Herman P; Norde, Willem; Town, Raewyn M",Adv Colloid Interface Sci,,402

It explores how five major pandemics, namely, SARS in 2003, H1N1 in 2009, MERS in 2012, Ebola in 2014, and Zika in 2016 impacted the distribution of income across high income, upper-middle-income and lower-middle-income countries. How the inequality across quintiles share in income is impacted was explored. We used comprehensive panel data sets covering annual observations from 1995 to 2017 for 70 countries. The generalized least square estimation shows that the pandemics have a statistically significant positive impact upon income inequality particularly for the high-income group and also for the entire set of 70 countries. However, the impact of the pandemics is negative upon the upper-middle-income group of countries. The estimation is robust controlling for additional macroeconomic variables. The study demonstrates that past pandemics may generate a policy response that impacts the distribution of income. A weakened role of the state has been responsible for worsening inequality. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Das, P.; Bisai, S.; Ghosh, S.",International Review of Applied Economics,,402

Analysis of SARS-CoV-2 sequences can uncover single nucleotide variants (SNVs) and corresponding evolution patterns. The Global Evaluation of SARS-CoV-2/hCoV-19 Sequences (GESS, https://wan-bioinfo.shinyapps.io/GESS/) is a resource to provide comprehensive analysis results based on tens of thousands of high-coverage and high-quality SARS-CoV-2 complete genomes. The database allows user to browse, search and download SNVs at any individual or multiple SARS-CoV-2 genomic positions, or within a chosen genomic region or protein, or in certain country/area of interest. GESS reveals geographical distributions of SNVs around the world and across the states of USA, while exhibiting time-dependent patterns for SNV occurrences which reflect development of SARS-CoV-2 genomes. For each month, the top 100 SNVs that were firstly identified world-widely can be retrieved. GESS also explores SNVs occurring simultaneously with specific SNVs of user's interests. Furthermore, the database can be of great help to calibrate mutation rates and identify conserved genome regions. Taken together, GESS is a powerful resource and tool to monitor SARS-CoV-2 migration and evolution according to featured genomic variations. It provides potential directive information for prevalence prediction, related public health policy making, and vaccine designs.","Fang, Shuyi; Li, Kailing; Shen, Jikui; Liu, Sheng; Liu, Juli; Yang, Lei; Hu, Chang-Deng; Wan, Jun",Nucleic Acids Res,,402

Les engelures et les exanthèmes sont les 2 manifestations dermatologiques les plus décrites. Le but du travail était de déterminer la prévalence, les caractéristiques des patients et l’évolution de la COVID-19 en fonction de la présence d’engelures et/ou d’un rash chez les patients ambulatoires. Matériels et méthodes Large cohorte régionale observationnelle de patients ambulatoires COVID-19 suivis par un système de télésurveillance comprenant uniquement des patients&gt;18 ans qui ont dû remplir un questionnaire standardisé de suivi. Les critères d’étude étaient l’incidence, les caractéristiques cliniques et l’évolution des patients présentant des engelures et/ou un rash, en comparaison à ceux n’ayant aucune de ces lésions cutanées. Résultats Du 09/03/2020 au 22/09/2020 : 28 957 patients ambulatoires ont été inclus dans l’étude. L’âge moyen était de 43,1±14 ans et le sex-ratio (H/F) était de 0,58. La prévalence du rash et des engelures était respectivement de 9,5 % (2756/28 957) et 3,7 % (1082/28 957). En analyse multivariée, la présence d’un rash survenait préférentiellement chez les asthmatiques ([OR]=1,14 ;IC95 %=1,02–1,28), et était significativement associée à l’asthénie, frissons et myalgies ([OR]=2,01 ;IC95 %=1,59–2,53), aux symptômes respiratoires (dyspnée [OR]=1,18 ;IC95 %=1,07–1,29, toux [OR]=1,15 ;IC95 %=1,05–1,26, douleurs thoraciques [OR]=1,22 ;IC95 %=1,11–1,33, oppressions thoraciques [OR]=1,33 ;IC95 %=1,21–1,46), aux symptômes gastro-intestinaux (anorexie [OR]=1,36 ;IC95 %=1,24–1,49, nausées/vomissements [OR]=1,36 ;IC95 %=1,24–1,49, diarrhées [OR]=1,54 ;IC95 %=1,42–1,68), et à l’anosmie/agueusie ([OR]=1,23 ;IC95 %=1,13–1,34).

Aiming at this problem, this paper incorporates psychological capital and social panic into the model from the perspective of the organizational safety climate and constructs a theoretical model of the mechanism of the effect on nursing staff's willingness to stay in the context of the outbreak. Through a questionnaire survey in an aged care agency in Anhui Province, a total of 321 valid questionnaires were collected for empirical analysis. The results show that: (1) the safety climate of the organization has a significant positive impact on the transactional psychological capital and interpersonal psychological capital of nursing staff in the aged care industry and their willingness to stay;(2) transactional psychological capital and social panic have a significant positive impact on the willingness to stay of nursing staff, while interpersonal psychological capital has no significant impact on the willingness to stay;(3) the mediating role of transactional psychological capital and interpersonal psychological capital between the safety climate and the willingness to stay is established, and the moderating role of social panic between psychological capital and willingness to stay is also established. Finally, based on the research conclusions, corresponding countermeasures and suggestions are put forward to deal with the problems that occur in special periods.","Wang, Y.; Liang, C.; Zhao, S.; Ma, Y.; Xie, Y.",Healthcare,,402

Applying PyR0 to all publicly available SARS-CoV-2 genomes, we identify numerous substitutions that increase transmissibility, including previously identified spike mutations and many non-spike mutations within the nucleocapsid and nonstructural proteins. PyR0 forecasts growth of new lineages from their mutational profile, identifies viral lineages of concern as they emerge, and prioritizes mutations of biological and public health concern for functional characterization.

While the sharing economy may contribute to addressing sustainability issues, its actual economic, social and environmental impacts remain poorly understood. Advancing more sustainably promising forms of sharing and leveraging its benefits, while circumventing its pitfalls, is becoming increasingly important in the era of Covid-19 and climate crisis, economic downturn and uncertainty, and loss of social connectedness, particularly in anonymous urban environments. The ways to capitalise on strengths of the sharing economy are still poorly understood. In particular, the roles and perspectives of users, businesses and municipal governments in institutionalising the sharing economy in various geographical contexts are essential to examine. This volume seeks to advance the research field by focusing on four research areas: 1) understanding the sharing economy conceptually; 2) user perspectives on the sharing economy; 3) business perspective on the sharing economy; and 4) urban governance perspective on the sharing economy. The twenty articles in this volume discuss sustainability implications of the sharing economy from different perspectives, in various geographical contexts, and drawing on a range of disciplines. The volume makes a significant contribution by bringing in empirical findings from emerging and developing economies, including Brazil, China, Indonesia, Poland, the Philippines, South Korea, Thailand and Vietnam, thereby supplementing more frequently discussed perspectives from high-income countries.

242017,A structural equation model to examine the clinical features of mild-to-moderate COVID-19: A multicenter Italian study,2020,"Diabetic retinopathy (DR), one of the common complications of diabetes, is the leading cause of visual loss in working-age individuals in many industrialized countries. It has been traditionally regarded as a purely microvascular disease in the retina. However, an increasing number of studies have shown that DR is a complex neurovascular disorder that affects not only vascular structure but also neural tissue of the retina. Deterioration of neural retina could precede microvascular abnormalities in the DR, leading to microvascular changes. Furthermore, disruption of interactions among neurons, vascular cells, glia and local immune cells, which collectively form the neurovascular unit, is considered to be associated with the progression of DR early on in the disease. Therefore, it makes sense to develop new therapeutic strategies to prevent or reverse retinal neurodegeneration, neuroinflammation and impaired cell-cell interactions of the neurovascular unit in early stage DR. Here, we present current perspectives on the pathophysiology of DR as a neurovascular disease, especially at the early stage. Potential novel treatments for preventing or reversing neurovascular injuries in DR are discussed as well.","Nian, Shen; Lo, Amy C Y; Mi, Yajing; Ren, Kai; Yang, Di",Eye Vis (Lond),,402
242018,A structural equation model to examine the clinical features of mild-to-moderate COVID-19: A multicenter Italian study,2020,"BACKGROUND Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) occurs because of a novel enveloped ribonucleic acid coronavirus called severe acute respiratory distress syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). One of the major reported complications of COVID-19 includes both arterial and venous thromboembolism (VTE). Here we describe a case of COVID-19 provoked pulmonary embolism in a young patient already receiving prophylactic treatment for VTE. CASE REPORT A 46-year-old female with past medical history of diabetes mellites, hypertension, and asthma presented in the emergency department (ED) with dyspnea requiring 6 liters per minute of oxygen on presentation. Her main complaints were cough and vomiting. In the ED, hypoxemia worsened, and she ultimately required endotracheal intubation. Labs were suggestive of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and showed increase in all inflammatory markers and absolute lymphocytopenia. Chest X-ray showed bilateral diffuse patchy airspace opacities. Standard DKA management was started. She was also started on ceftriaxone, azithromycin, hydroxychloroquine, and subcutaneous heparin (5000 U every 8 h) for VTE prophylaxis. SARS-Cov2 reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction returned positive. Ceftriaxone and azithromycin were discontinued the very next day because of low suspicion of bacterial infection while hydroxychloroquine was completed for 5 days. On the third day of admission, the patient self-extubated and was immediately placed on nonrebreather with spO2 in low 90s. On the fourth day of admission, D-dimer came back 4.74 mg/L, which was elevated from a prior value, so computed tomography angiography of the lungs was done, which disclosed multiple emboli in the lungs. She was started on therapeutic doses of enoxaparin sodium, which was continued through her admission. She was switched to Apixaban on discharge. CONCLUSIONS The finding of the case suggested that low-molecular-weight heparin prophylaxis may not be sufficient to prevent VTE in COVID-19 pneumonia. Some of these patients may benefit from receiving prophylactic half doses or full doses of anticoagulants.","Haider, Maryam B; Abbas, Farrukh; Hafeez, Wasif",Am J Case Rep,,402

Here we use a single experimental platform based on immunodeficient mice implanted with human lung tissue (hereafter, human lung-only mice (LoM)) to demonstrate the efficient in vivo replication of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), as well as two endogenous SARS-like bat coronaviruses that show potential for emergence as human pathogens. Virus replication in this model occurs in bona fide human lung tissue and does not require any type of adaptation of the virus or the host. Our results indicate that bats contain endogenous coronaviruses that are capable of direct transmission to humans. Our detailed analysis of in vivo infection with SARS-CoV-2 in human lung tissue from LoM showed a predominant infection of human lung epithelial cells, including type-2 pneumocytes that are present in alveoli and ciliated airway cells. Acute infection with SARS-CoV-2 was highly cytopathic and induced a robust and sustained type-I interferon and inflammatory cytokine and chemokine response. Finally, we evaluated a therapeutic and pre-exposure prophylaxis strategy for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Our results show that therapeutic and prophylactic administration of EIDD-2801-an oral broad-spectrum antiviral agent that is currently in phase II/III clinical trials-markedly inhibited SARS-CoV-2 replication in vivo, and thus has considerable potential for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19.","Wahl, Angela; Gralinski, Lisa E; Johnson, Claire E; Yao, Wenbo; Kovarova, Martina; Dinnon, Kenneth H; Liu, Hongwei; Madden, Victoria J; Krzystek, Halina M; De, Chandrav; White, Kristen K; Gully, Kendra; Schäfer, Alexandra; Zaman, Tanzila; Leist, Sarah R; Grant, Paul O; Bluemling, Gregory R; Kolykhalov, Alexander A; Natchus, Michael G; Askin, Frederic B; Painter, George; Browne, Edward P; Jones, Corbin D; Pickles, Raymond J; Baric, Ralph S; Garcia, J Victor",Nature,,402

Essas medidas podem ser utilizadas como critérios de seleção de bovinos, requerendo identificação de fatores ambientais que as influenciem, assim como a verificação de variabilidade genética e a inter-relação destas com as demais características de interesse ao sistema de produção. O objetivo deste estudo foi estimar parâmetros genéticos, fenotípicos e ambientais de quatro medidas de avaliação do temperamento de bovinos da raça Canchim. As medidas de temperamento utilizadas foram: tempo de saída (TS), escore composto de temperamento (ECT), escore total (ET) e reatividade (REAT). Neste trabalho foram analisadas 2090 informações de bovinos da raça Canchim provenientes da fazenda Canchim, pertencente à Embrapa Pecuária Sudeste, situada na cidade de São Carlos, SP. As características foram analisadas utilizando-se um modelo animal, por meio de análises bi-característica. Para todas as características, o grupo de contemporâneos (GC) foi formado por animais nascidos no mesmo ano e pertencentes ao mesmo sexo. As avaliações foram realizadas durante as fases de desmama, ano e sobreano. As medidas de temperamento apresentaram estimativas de herdabilidade que variaram de 0,07 (0,142) (TS na desmama) a 0,36 (0,240) (TS, ao sobreano). As baixas magnitudes das estimativas indicam que as características são influenciadas principalmente por práticas de manejo e pelas condições ambientais, sendo importante o conhecimento de tais fatores para ações de seleção. As estimativas de correlação genética foram maiores entre ETxREAT (1,00 no sobreano), enquanto entre ETxTS e REATxTS as estimativas foram de -0,26 e -0,43, respectivamente no sobreano. As correlações genéticas estimadas entre as medidas de temperamento sugerem que os mesmos conjuntos de genes aditivos atuam na determinação das diferentes medidas de temperamento. Os coeficientes de repetibilidade foram 0,34, 0,57 e 0,43 para as variáveis ET, REAT e TS, respectivamente. Os resultados demonstram que o temperamento pode vir a ser utilizado como critério de seleção visando obter animais mais dóceis.","MUSSATO, VANIA CASARI",,,402

Objective: To assess clinical outcomes with convalescent plasma treatment vs placebo or standard of care in peer-reviewed and preprint publications or press releases of randomized clinical trials (RCTs). Data Sources: PubMed, the Cochrane COVID-19 trial registry, and the Living Overview of Evidence platform were searched until January 29, 2021. Study Selection: The RCTs selected compared any type of convalescent plasma vs placebo or standard of care for patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 in any treatment setting. Data Extraction and Synthesis: Two reviewers independently extracted data on relevant clinical outcomes, trial characteristics, and patient characteristics and used the Cochrane Risk of Bias Assessment Tool. The primary analysis included peer-reviewed publications of RCTs only, whereas the secondary analysis included all publicly available RCT data (peer-reviewed publications, preprints, and press releases). Inverse variance-weighted meta-analyses were conducted to summarize the treatment effects. The certainty of the evidence was assessed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation. Main Outcomes and Measures: All-cause mortality, length of hospital stay, clinical improvement, clinical deterioration, mechanical ventilation use, and serious adverse events. Results: A total of 1060 patients from 4 peer-reviewed RCTs and 10â¯722 patients from 6 other publicly available RCTs were included. The summary risk ratio (RR) for all-cause mortality with convalescent plasma in the 4 peer-reviewed RCTs was 0.93 (95% CI, 0.63 to 1.38), the absolute risk difference was -1.21% (95% CI, -5.29% to 2.88%), and there was low certainty of the evidence due to imprecision. Across all 10 RCTs, the summary RR was 1.02 (95% CI, 0.92 to 1.12) and there was moderate certainty of the evidence due to inclusion of unpublished data. Among the peer-reviewed RCTs, the summary hazard ratio was 1.17 (95% CI, 0.07 to 20.34) for length of hospital stay, the summary RR was 0.76 (95% CI, 0.20 to 2.87) for mechanical ventilation use (the absolute risk difference for mechanical ventilation use was -2.56% [95% CI, -13.16% to 8.05%]), and there was low certainty of the evidence due to imprecision for both outcomes. Limited data on clinical improvement, clinical deterioration, and serious adverse events showed no significant differences. Conclusions and Relevance: Treatment with convalescent plasma compared with placebo or standard of care was not significantly associated with a decrease in all-cause mortality or with any benefit for other clinical outcomes. The certainty of the evidence was low to moderate for all-cause mortality and low for other outcomes.","Janiaud, Perrine; Axfors, Cathrine; Schmitt, Andreas M; Gloy, Viktoria; Ebrahimi, Fahim; Hepprich, Matthias; Smith, Emily R; Haber, Noah A; Khanna, Nina; Moher, David; Goodman, Steven N; Ioannidis, John P A; Hemkens, Lars G",JAMA,,402

It is important for policy makers to know how the disease will spread, and what are the effects of the policies and environment on the spreading. In this paper, we propose two extensions to the standard infectious disease models: (a) We consider the prevention measures adopted based on the current severity of the infection, those measures are adaptive and change over time. (b) Multiple cities and regions are considered, with population movements between those cities/regions, while taking into account that each region may have different prevention measures. While the adaptive measures and mobility of the population were often observed during the pandemic, these effects are rarely explicitly modeled and studied in the classical epidemic models. The model we propose gives rise to a plateau phenomenon: the number of people infected by the disease stay at the same level during an extended period of time. We show what are conditions needs to be met in order for the spreading to exhibit a plateau period, and we show that this phenomenon is interdependent: when considering multiples cities, the conditions are different from a single city. We verify from the real-world data that plateau phenomenon does exists in many regions of the world in the current COVID-19 development. Finally, we provide theoretical analysis on the plateau phenomenon for the single-city model, and derive a series of results on the emergence and ending of the plateau, and on the height and length of the plateau. Our theoretical results match well with our empirical findings.","Wu, Ziqiang; Liao, Hao; Vidmer, Alexandre; Zhou, Mingyang; Chen, Wei",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.03376v1.pdf,402
255093,The common risk factors for progression and mortality in COVID-19 patients: a meta-analysis,2021,"In pandemic surveillance, ensuring social distance has emerged as a challenging issue due to the lack of proper therapeutic agents, and this envisages the need for automated social distance monitoring to avoid the formation of social gatherings and free-standing conversation groups (FCGs). The robustness sought in detecting these groups cannot be achieved when there are illumination variation and occlusion among subjects by solely relying on video data from distributed cameras. In this paper, we propose a deep learning framework for integrating data from multiple sensor modalities taking into account the spatial properties necessary to manage illumination variation and occlusion of video data. From the fused data, social distance compliance violations are notified by the presence of social groups as graphs detected using a pre-trained deep framework and connected components in graph theory. A cost function is devised for social group graph clustering to identify FCGs by using the socio-psychological theory of Friends-formation. Experiment analysis on four benchmark datasets shows that the proposed approach excels at detecting social distance violations and FCGs, and succeeds in analyzing the potential risk of pandemic spread in an area by the calculation of violation scores and rate of violation.","Varghese, Elizabeth B.; Thampi, Sabu M.",Engineering Applications of Artificial Intelligence,,402
255868,Pos-211 Safety and Efficacy of Bedside Placement of Tunneled Hemodialysis Catheters in Patients with Covid-19 in the Intensive Care Unit,2021,"Infection with SARS-CoV-2 elicits robust antibody responses in some patients, with a majority of the response directed at the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the spike surface glycoprotein. Remarkably, many patient-derived antibodies that potently inhibit viral infection harbor few to no mutations from the germline, suggesting that naïve antibody libraries are a viable means for discovery of novel SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies. Here, we used a yeast surface-display library of human naïve antibodies to isolate and characterize three novel neutralizing antibodies that target the RBD: one that blocks interaction with angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), the human receptor for SARS-CoV-2, and two that target other epitopes on the RBD. These three antibodies neutralized SARS-CoV-2 spike-pseudotyped lentivirus with IC50 values as low as 60 ng/ml in vitro. Using a biolayer interferometry-based binding competition assay, we determined that these antibodies have distinct but overlapping epitopes with antibodies elicited during natural COVID-19 infection. Taken together, these analyses highlight how in vitro selection of naïve antibodies can mimic the humoral response in vivo, yielding neutralizing antibodies and various epitopes that can be effectively targeted on the SARS-CoV-2 RBD.","Bell, Benjamin N; Powell, Abigail E; Rodriguez, Carlos; Cochran, Jennifer R; Kim, Peter S",Protein Sci,,402

Asiaticus (Clas)' is one of the destructive diseases for citrus, threatening the development of citrus industry. Adopting a proper fertilization method instead of using pesticides seems particularly important, which would contribute to a sustainable development of orchard. In this study, the impact of soil application of nutrients combined with foliar spray of macro- and micro-nutrients on the incidence of HLB and the phyllosphere and rhizosphere bacterial microbiome was investigated in Gannan Navel Orange orchard from 2015 to 2018. Compared with the control (T1), the yield of Gannan Navel Orange in all other treatments applied with macro- and micro-nutrients increased significantly in 2018 (by 20.5%-45.8%), but not in the first two years (2016-17). Among treatments, Ca + Mg + B application in soil (T2) showed the highest yield and lowest HLB incidence. According to the PCR results, CLas was negative in T2 but positive in the control, which directly proved HLB incidence was reduced with Ca + Mg + B application in soil. Moreover, 16S rRNA sequencing was used to characterize rhizosphere and phyllosphere microbial communities. Results showed that microbial biodiversity was increased and microbial community structure was altered in T2 treatment, of which the beneficial bacteria were enriched in phyllosphere and rhizosphere. The results of PICRUSt showed that in T2 treatment, rhizosphere microbe contained more membrane transport (ABC transporters) genes, while, carbohydrate metabolism genes were enriched in the control rhizosphere due to HLB obstruct the photosynthetic metabolite transport. In summary, results indicated that macro- and micro-nutrients application improved the yield of Gannan Navel Orange and soil application of Ca + Mg + B reduced HLB incidence by altering microbial community structure and increasing microbial biodiversity.

256151,"Home Management of Patients with Moderate or Severe Respiratory Failure Secondary to COVID-19, Using Remote Monitoring and Oxygen with or without HFNC",2021,"To access temporal changes in psychobehavioral responses to the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, we conducted a 5-round (R1-R5) longitudinal population-based online survey in Hong Kong during January-September 2020. Most respondents reported wearing masks (R1 99.0% to R5 99.8%) and performing hand hygiene (R1 95.8% to R5 97.7%). Perceived COVID-19 severity decreased significantly, from 97.4% (R1) to 77.2% (R5), but perceived self-susceptibility remained high (87.2%-92.8%). Female sex and anxiety were associated with greater adoption of social distancing. Intention to receive COVID-19 vaccines decreased significantly (R4 48.7% to R5 37.6%). Greater anxiety, confidence in vaccine, and collective responsibility and weaker complacency were associated with higher tendency to receive COVID-19 vaccines. Although its generalizability should be assumed with caution, this study helps to formulate health communication strategies and foretells the initial low uptake rate of COVID-19 vaccines, suggesting that social distancing should be maintained in the medium term.","Kwok, Kin On; Li, Kin Kit; Tang, Arthur; Tsoi, Margaret Ting Fong; Chan, Emily Ying Yang; Tang, Julian Wei Tze; Wong, Angel; Wei, Wan In; Wong, Samuel Yeung Shan",Emerg Infect Dis,,402

SARS-CoV-2 has spread globally to cause significant morbidity and mortality, and there still remain unknowns about the biology and pathology of the virus. Even with testing, tracing, and social distancing, many countries are struggling to contain SARS-CoV-2. COVID-19 will only be suppressible when herd immunity develops, either because of an effective vaccine or if the population has been infected and is resistant to reinfection. There is virtually no chance of a return to pre-COVID-19 societal behavior until there is an effective vaccine. Concerted efforts by physicians, academic laboratories, and companies around the world have improved detection and treatment and made promising early steps, developing many vaccine candidates at a pace that has been unmatched for prior diseases. As of August 11, 2020, 28 of these companies have advanced into clinical trials with Moderna, CanSino, the University of Oxford, BioNTech, Sinovac, Sinopharm, Anhui Zhifei Longcom, Inovio, Novavax, Vaxine, Zydus Cadila, Institute of Medical Biology, and the Gamaleya Research Institute having moved beyond their initial safety and immunogenicity studies.

258723,Influence of nutritional status on clinical outcomes among hospitalized patients with COVID-19,2021,"The expansion of cities and their impacts currently constitutes a challenge for the achievement of sustainable development goals (SDGs). In this respect, assessments of resource consumption and the delivery of appropriate policies to support resource conservation are of paramount importance. Previous works in the literature have focused on one specific resource (e.g., water, energy, food) at the household level, while others have analysed the inter-relations among different resources (i.e., the nexus approach) at larger spatial scales (e.g., urban level). Moreover, household behavioural attitudes are generally excluded while assessing resource consumption scenarios. This work overcomes previous limitations by proposing a causal-loop structure derived from the literature, from which simulations of different scenarios can be generated that consider the nexus between food, energy and water at the household level. These simulations can provide alternative scenarios to assess the impacts of monetary policies as well as education and communication actions on the enhancement of resource savings and consider both their current use and household preferences. The metropolitan area of Napoli was chosen as the testbed area for the simulations. The results, in relation to the testbed, proved that communication actions would be most appropriate to increase the level of resource savings. The business-as-usual scenario was especially sensitive to variations in individual preferences towards pro-environmental behaviours and showed their higher impacts on the results. Improvements of this method and its derived scenarios in the context of the urban planning process could support the implementation of informed policies towards the conservation of key resources and promotion of sustainable citizen behaviour.","Casazza, Marco; Xue, Jingyan; Du, Shupan; Liu, Gengyuan; Ulgiati, Sergio",PLoS One,,402

A prospective cohort study,2021,"In 2018 prion disease was detected in camels at an abattoir in Algeria for the first time. The emergence of prion disease in this species made it prudent to assess the probability of entry of the pathogen into the United Kingdom (UK) from this region. Potentially contaminated products were identified as evidenced by other prion diseases. The aggregated probability of entry of the pathogen was estimated as very high and high for legal milk and cheese imports respectively and very high, high and high for illegal meat, milk and cheese products respectively. This aggregated probability represents a qualitative assessment of the probability of one or more entry events per year into the UK; it gives no indication of the number of entry events per year. The uncertainty associated with these estimates was high due to the unknown variation in prevalence of infection in camels and an uncertain number and type of illegal products entering the UK. Potential public health implications of this pathogen are unknown although there is currently no evidence of zoonotic transmission of prion diseases other than bovine spongiform encephalopathy to humans.","Horigan, Verity; Gale, Paul; Adkin, Amie; Konold, Timm; Cassar, Claire; Spiropoulos, John; Kelly, Louise",Microb Risk Anal,,402

267301,"Corrigendum to: Epidemiological characteristics of patients with severe COVID-19 infection in Wuhan, China: evidence from a retrospective, observational study",2021,"OBJECTIVE: The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in South Kivu, Democratic Republic of Congo raised concerns regarding additional morbidity and mortality. Updating these indicators before a second wave is essential in order to prepare for additional help. METHODS: From mid-May to mid-December 2020, weekly surveys were undertaken in sampled streets from 10 health areas to quantify the use of barrier measures, and interview pedestrians about sickness and deaths in their households. Crude death rates (CDRs) were estimated. RESULTS: Minimal use or no use of face masks was observed in at least half of the streets. From May to December 2020, the number of suspected cases of COVID-19 increased six-fold (P < 0.05). Of deaths within 30 days preceding the interviews, 20% were considered to be related to COVID-19. The monthly CDRs at the beginning and end of the study were approximately 5 and 25 per 1000 population, respectively (P < 0.05); that is, annual CDRs of 60 and 260 per 1000 population, respectively. Thus, during the first wave, the estimated mortality rate increased by 50% compared with previous years, and increased at least four-fold by the end of 2020. CONCLUSION: Despite possible overestimations, the excess mortality in South Kivu is extremely concerning.

Unlike planned e-learning programs, medical schools have had to quickly deliver the entire medical curriculum using remote strategies. This study aimed to perform a meta-synthesis of previous pandemic situations and describe the experience of the São Paulo University School of Medicine. We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Medline, EMBASE, Lilacs, Scopus, Web of Science, and ERIC, using the following keywords: (""SARS"" OR ""severe acute respiratory syndrome"" OR ""severe acute respiratory syndrome"" OR ""Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus"" OR ""middle east respiratory syndrome*"" OR ""MERS-CoV"" OR ""Mers"" OR ""Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome*"" OR ""MERS-CoV*"" OR ""coronavirus"" OR ""Coronavirus Infections"" OR ""coronavirus*"" OR ""COVID-19"" OR ""2019-nCoV"" OR ""SARS-CoV-2"") AND (""online education"" OR ""Education, Distance"" OR ""e-learning"" OR ""course online"" OR ""flipped classroom"") AND (""lockdown"" OR ""social distance"" OR ""quarantine""). The endpoints were the online platforms used for online learning, the model of class, recorded versus online interaction, duration of online lectures, and students' and teachers' perceptions of online learning. We retrieved 38 records; only seven articles studied online education methods related to the pandemic and social distancing rules. The most frequently used online platform was Zoom®. The studies examined both synchronous and asynchronous approaches. There was no evidence regarding duration and students' and teachers' attitude. This study suggests that the online learning shift was feasible; however, because of the nature of the education shift (pandemic), future studies must further analyze the educational structure.","Camargo, Cristina Pires; Tempski, Patricia Zen; Busnardo, Fabio Freitas; Martins, Milton de Arruda; Gemperli, Rolf",Clinics (Sao Paulo),,402
267712,"Clinical characteristics and risk factors for mortality among inpatients with COVID-19 in Wuhan, China",2020,"Purpose: This study aimed to analyze how a private high school in Seoul developed and executed a ""school disinfection strategy"" to ensure the students' right to study in a safe environment, and also to analyze the lessons learned from this process. Methods: This was a case study of school health in a community-based school reopening during the COVID-19 pandemic. The study target was a 64-year-old private high school with 12 classes for each grade with a total of 1,100 students. Results: A ""school disinfection strategy"" was set up at individual and class environment levels to protect students from the risk of infection. In addition, school health activities were carried out with a ""personal protection safety belt"" and ""community protection safety belt"" for effective implementation. To ensure a safe educational environment for high school students and to ensure smooth execution of face-to-face classes (in-person teaching), the ""prevention safety belt strategy"" was introduced in accordance with governmental guidelines to sequentially implement various preventive measures necessary to guarantee environmental safety of schools. Activating personal prevention safety belts by checking the symptoms of students when entering the school and during each class, and providing self-made disinfectants by spraying alcohol on wet-wipes were cost-effective and sustainable methods used in this school to prevent the spread of infection. Conclusions: The experience of developing a prevention safety belt strategy to adapt the guidelines of the local education office to the school situation was presented. Focusing on the school community, as well as individual students and teachers, the concept of prevention safety belts helped to unite and stimulate voluntary participation of students in health promotion activities.","Kwon, Insook; Kang, Sunjoo; Kim, Jin Sun",Front Public Health,,402

268573,Variety of radiological findings in a family with COVID-19: a case report,2020,"Background: As one of the most lethal cancers, pancreatic cancer has been characterized by abundant supportive tumor-stromal cell microenvironment. Although the advent of tumor-targeted immune checkpoint blockers has brought light to patients with other cancers, its clinical efficacy in pancreatic cancer has been greatly limited due to the protective stroma. Thus, it is urgent to find potential new targets and establish multi-regulatory networks to predict patient prognosis and improve treatment. Methods: We followed a strategy based on mining the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database and ESTIMATE algorithm to obtain the immune scores and stromal scores. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) associated with poor overall survival of pancreatic cancer were screened from a TCGA cohort. By comparing global gene expression with high vs. low immune scores and subsequent Kaplan-Meier analysis, DEGs that significantly correlate with poor overall survival of pancreatic cancer in TCGA cohort were extracted. After constructing the protein-protein interaction network using STRING and limiting the genes within the above DEGs, we utilized RAID 2.0, TRRUST v2 database and degree and betweenness analysis to obtain non-coding RNA (ncRNA)-pivotal nodes and TF-pivotal nodes. Finally, multi-regulatory networks have been constructed and pivotal drugs with potential benefit for pancreatic cancer patients were obtained by screening in the DrugBank. Results: In this study, we obtained 246 DEGs that significantly correlate with poor overall survival of pancreatic cancer in the TCGA cohort. With the advent of 38 ncRNA-pivotal nodes and 7 TF-pivotal nodes, the multi-factor regulatory networks were constructed based on the above pivotal nodes. Prognosis-related genes and factors such as HCAR3, PPY, RFWD2, WSPAR and Amcinonide were screened and investigated. Conclusion: The multi-regulatory networks constructed in this study are not only beneficial to improve treatment and evaluate patient prognosis with pancreatic cancer, but also favorable for implementing early diagnosis and personalized treatment. It is suggested that these factors may play an essential role in the progression of pancreatic cancer.","Li, Tong; Liu, Qiaofei; Zhang, Ronghua; Liao, Quan; Zhao, Yupei",Cancer Cell Int,,402
268633,Healthcare Workers' (HCWs) attitudes towards mandatory influenza vaccination: A systematic review and meta-analysis,2021,"BACKGROUND & AIM: Verify the prevalence of hypovitaminosis D and obesity in elderly patients infected by new coronavirus. The patients developed severe symptoms and were admitted in intensive care unit (ICU) to receive invasive ventilation due to diagnosis of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). METHODS: A cross-sectional descriptive study composed of elderly (age &#8805; 60 years) admitted to the ICU. Were collected demographic (sex, age), anthropometric data, presence of comorbidities (hypertension, diabetes, heart disease, lung, neurological and oncological diseases), severity score in ICU (SAPS III), PaO2/FiO2 ratio, analysis of C-reactive protein (CRP) and serum dosage of 25-hydroxy vitamin D (25 OHD) in the first day of hospitalization to identify elderly with hypovitaminosis D (low values < 30 ng/mL). The diagnosis of obesity in elderly was determined by calculating the body mass index (BMI) &#8805; 30 kg/m2. RESULTS: A total of 176 elderly met the inclusion criteria. 54% were elderly men and mean age of 72.9 ± 9.1 years. The median BMI was 30.5 (28.1-33) kg/m2 with 68.7% having a nutritional diagnosis of obesity and 15.3% had BMI &#8805; 35 kg/m2. The most prevalent comorbidities were hypertension (72.2%) and diabetes (40.9%). Prevalence of hypovitaminosis D with values of 25 OHD <30 ng/mL, < 20 ng/mL and <10 ng/mL was 93.8%, 65.9% and 21% respectively. The prevalence of hypovitaminosis D (<30 ng/mL) in obese elderly was 94.2%. There was a negative and significant bivariate correlation between BMI and levels of 25 OHD (r = - 0.15; p = 0.04). CONCLUSION: Hypovitaminosis D and obesity in elderly have a high prevalence in critically ill patients in ICU infected by the new coronavirus. Laboratory investigation of vitamin D becomes important, especially in obese elderly patients.","Gonçalves, Thiago José Martins; Gonçalves, Sandra Elisa Adami Batista; Guarnieri, Andreia; Risegato, Rodrigo Cristovão; Guimarães, Maysa Penteado; de Freitas, Daniella Cabral; Razuk-Filho, Alvaro; Benedito Junior, Pedro Batista; Parrillo, Eduardo Fagundes",Clin Nutr ESPEN,,402

If it is overturned, protection of reproductive rights will be determined by the acts of individual state governments, some of which have already signaled that they will ban or severely restrict access to abortion. Health care professionals working in states that maintain the laws that applied in the time before the overturn of Roe may wish to provide assistance-anything from consultation to shipping medications-to women living in more restrictive venues. However, it is important for health care professionals to be aware of the legal consequences of those acts, as well as ethical considerations, when deciding whether to adhere to or to defy laws that they believe threaten the well-being of women. It is likely that legal consequences will vary with the type of act in which a physician engages.

270034,Successful PCI with stenting for total occlusion of right coronary artery in a female patient with acute coronary syndrome in COVID -19 era,2020,"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has currently become a major global public health problem. The prevalence of COVID-19 has increased rapidly worldwide. Since there is no effective COVID-19 vaccine available yet, it is increasingly important to understand the average incubation period of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) to design appropriate preventive and control strategies. Therefore, this systematic review and meta-analysis was designed to estimate the pooled average incubation period of SARS-CoV-2. Methods: We conducted a systematic electronic web-based search of online databases including PubMed, Google Scholar, EMBASE, and the World Health Organization's HINARI portal. We included peer-reviewed research studies written in the English language on the incubation period of SARS-CoV-2 using pre-defined quality and inclusion criteria. STATA version 15 statistical software was used to analyze the data. Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) critical appraisal quality assessment tool for observational studies was utilized to evaluate the included studies. We extracted relevant data and presented in a tabular form. The I2 test was used to assess heterogeneity across studies. Funnel plot asymmetry and Egger's tests were used to check for publication bias. The final effect size was determined by applying a random-effects model. Results: Our search identified 206 studies, amongst which 18 studies, representing 22,595 participants were included in the final analysis. The pooled average incubation period of SARS-CoV-2 was 5.7 days (95% CI: 5.1, 6.4). Subgroup analyses by geographic location showed that the pooled average incubation period of SARS-CoV-2 was 6.1 days (95% CI: 5.34, 6.94) in China and 4.54 (95% CI: 3.9, 5.2) in other countries (Singapore, South Korea, and globally). Conclusion: The pooled average incubation period of SARS-CoV-2 was about six days. The longest incubation period was observed in China. The global health initiatives as well as local health planners should consider, this average incubation period while designing optimal prevention and control strategies for SARS-CoV-2.","Wassie, Gizachew Tadesse; Azene, Abebaw Gedef; Bantie, Getasew Mulat; Dessie, Getenet; Aragaw, Abiba Mihret",Curr Ther Res Clin Exp,,402
270132,"Lactate dehydrogenase, an independent risk factor of severe COVID-19 patients: a retrospective and observational study",2020,"Microbubble contrast agents hold great promise for drug delivery applications with ultrasound. Encapsulating drugs in nanoparticles reduces systemic toxicity and increases circulation time of the drugs. In a novel approach to microbubble-assisted drug delivery, nanoparticles are incorporated in or on microbubble shells, enabling local and triggered release of the nanoparticle payload with ultrasound. A thorough understanding of the release mechanisms within the vast ultrasound parameter space is crucial for efficient and controlled release. This set of presented protocols is applicable to microbubbles with a shell containing a fluorescent label. Here, the focus is on microbubbles loaded with poly(2-ethyl-butyl cyanoacrylate) polymeric nanoparticles, doped with a modified Nile Red dye. The particles are fixed within a denatured casein shell. The microbubbles are produced by vigorous stirring, forming a dispersion of perfluoropropane gas in the liquid phase containing casein and nanoparticles, after which the microbubble shell self-assembles. A variety of microscopy techniques are needed to characterize the nanoparticle-stabilized microbubbles at all relevant timescales of the nanoparticle release process. Fluorescence of the nanoparticles enables confocal imaging of single microbubbles, revealing the particle distribution within the shell. In vitro ultra-high-speed imaging using bright-field microscopy at 10 million frames per second provides insight into the bubble dynamics in response to ultrasound insonation. Finally, nanoparticle release from the bubble shell is best visualized by means of fluorescence microscopy, performed at 500,000 frames per second. To characterize drug delivery in vivo, the triggered release of nanoparticles within the vasculature and their extravasation beyond the endothelial layer is studied using intravital microscopy in tumors implanted in dorsal skinfold window chambers, over a timescale of several minutes. The combination of these complementary characterization techniques provides unique insight into the behavior of microbubbles and their payload release at a range of time and length scales, both in vitro and in vivo.","Nawijn, Charlotte; Segers, Tim; Lajoinie, Guillaume; Mørch, Ýrr; Berg, Sigrid; Snipstad, Sofie; de Lange Davies, Catharina; Versluis, Michel",J. vis. exp,,402
270172,Lymphopenia as a Biological Predictor of Outcomes in COVID-19 Patients: A Nationwide Cohort Study,2021,"OBJECTIVES: To investigate the proportion and characteristics of asymptomatic infection among healthcare workers (HCWs). METHODS: This study retrospectively investigated 1407 HCWs who were screened for COVID-19 by chest computed tomography (CT) scans and nasopharyngeal swabs for SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid. Demographics, CT features, nasopharyngeal swabs, baseline symptoms, and laboratory data were collected. RESULTS: Of 1407 HCWs, 235 had symptoms and 1172 were asymptomatic close contacts, of which, 107 were symptomatic cases and 84 were close contacts who had abnormal CT findings. Of 152 symptomatic individuals and 908 close contacts tested for SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid, 122 symptomatic cases and 38 close contacts had positive reverse-transcriptase real-time polymerase chain (RT-PCR) test results. The rate of confirmed asymptomatic infections was 4.2% (38/908). Both symptomatic and asymptomatic infected cases had high titrations of specific IgG or had &#8805;four-fold increase in IgG during convalescence compared with the acute phase. Combining the RT-PCR tests and serological findings, the rate of asymptomatic infections was 9.7% (88/908). In terms of the duration of viral shedding, there was no significant difference between symptomatic mild/moderate participants and asymptomatic infections. CONCLUSIONS: The findings demonstrated that a high rate of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 carriers existed among healthcare worker close contacts during the outbreak of COVID-19.","Zhao, Dong; Wang, Mengmei; Wang, Ming; Zhao, Yang; Zheng, Zhishui; Li, Xiaochen; Zhang, Yunting; Wang, Tao; Zeng, Shaolin; Hu, Weihua; Yu, Wenzhen; Hu, Ke",Int J Infect Dis,,402

Difference in response distributions between groups with different demographics was tested by Pearson &#967;2 test. Instead of advocating for advanced toilet facilities, respondents were mostly concerned about basic hygiene issues. Malfunctioning facilities resulting from poor toilet management, such as clogged toilets, stained facilities, and problematic flushing systems, were most cited as barriers to toilet hygiene practices. Three quarters of the survey respondents expressed concerns over worn and poorly maintained toilets, shortage of janitors, and cleansing supplies. However, respondents who were older (P < .001), less educated (P < .001), and had lower income (P = .001) were significantly more likely to find hygiene conditions in public toilets satisfactory. The findings reflected the substandard of the current provisions as a developed city in Asia. Enhanced efforts by the government to maintain basic toilet supplies and facilities is the key to improving public compliance to toilet hygiene practices.","Sun, Kai Sing; Lam, Tai Pong; Tang, Wai Sin; Chan, Hoi Yan; Lam, Kwok Fai; Chow, Enoch Ching Yeung; Wu, Dan; Zhou, Xu Dong; Xu, Jia Yao; Ho, Pak Leung",Asia Pac J Public Health,,402

METHODS: The COVID-19 ED (COVED) Project is an ongoing prospective cohort study in Australian EDs. This analysis presents data from 12 sites across four Australian states for the period from 1 July to 31 August 2020. All adult patients who met the criteria for 'suspected COVID-19' and underwent testing for SARS-CoV-2 in the ED were eligible for inclusion. Study outcomes included a positive SARS-CoV-2 test result, mechanical ventilation and in-hospital mortality. RESULTS: There were 106 136 presentations to the participating EDs and 12 055 (11.4%; 95% confidence interval [CI] 11.2-11.6) underwent testing for SARS-CoV-2. Of these, 255 (2%) patients returned a positive result. Among positive cases, 13 (5%) received mechanical ventilation during their hospital admission compared to 122 (2%) of the SARS-CoV-2 negative patients (odds ratio 2.7; 95% CI 1.5-4.9, P = 0.001). Nineteen (7%) SARS-CoV-2 positive patients died in hospital compared to 212 (3%) of the SARS-CoV-2 negative patients (odds ratio 2.3; 95% CI 1.4-3.7, P = 0.001). Strong clinical predictors of the SARS-CoV-2 test result included self-reported fever, sore throat, bilateral infiltrates on chest X-ray, and absence of a leucocytosis on first ED blood tests (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: In this prospective multi-site study during Australia's 'second wave', a substantial proportion of ED presentations required SARS-CoV-2 testing and isolation.

COVID-19 pandemic has affected various public health functions and essential services in different ways and magnitude. Although all countries have witnessed the effect of COVID-19, the impact differed based on many different factors including the integrity and resiliency of the countries' health systems. This paper presents opinions and expectations of the authors about the anticipated changes in the future of public health at the global, regional, and national levels. The viewpoint is based on the current efforts and challenges that various stakeholders have carried out to control COVID-19, and the contribution from the literature on the future of public health. Numerous agencies and actors are involved in the fight against COVID-19 with variations in their effectiveness. The public health services showed weaknesses in most of the countries, in addition to the lack of adequate curative medicine settings. The pandemic highlighted the need for better governance and stronger and more resilient health systems and capacities. COVID-19 experience has also emphasized the importance of coordination and collaboration among the countries and stakeholders. The COVID-19 pandemic might lead to a wide discussion to improve international and national approaches to prepare for and respond to similar events in terms of preparedness and response mechanisms, and tools. Public health will not be the same as before COVID-19. New health priorities, approaches, and new agenda will be on the table of the global platforms and initiatives. More investment in research and technology to meet the demand for the new vaccines and medicines, innovative methods like distance learning and working, more respect and remuneration to health professionals, and normalization of the public health and social measures that were induced during the COVID-19 pandemic are expected to be seen in future.","Bashier, Haitham; Ikram, Aamer; Khan, Mumtaz; Baig, Mirza; Al Gunaid, Magid; Al Nsour, Mohannad; Khader, Yousef",,,402

Additional measures to protect patients and healthcare workers from COVID-19 that may be transmitted by the inhalation sedation system are discussed. The authors recommend minimal use of a N20 system during inhalation sedation in dentistry. In case of need, the practitioners should have more than one scavenger kit and nasal masks for each N20/02 mixer. Biologic barriers should be mounted between the scavenger's tubing and the central evacuation system. Strict cleansing and sterilization should be performed for all parts of the N20 system.

These features and associated scaling laws are used as a powerful tool to pinpoint regions where analytical derivations are effective, get an insight into qualitative changes of the disease progression, and infer the key infection parameters. The developed framework for joint analytical and numerical analysis of empirically observed COVID-19 growth patterns can lead to a fundamental understanding of infection progression under strong control measures, applicable to outbursts of both COVID-19 and other infectious diseases.","Djordjevic, Magdalena; Djordjevic, Marko; Ilic, Bojana; Stojku, Stefan; Salom, Igor",Glob Chall,,402

Methods: From January 24 to February 6, 2020, the clinical and chest CT data of patients with common COVID-19 were analyzed retrospectively. A total of 64 patients were enrolled, including 32 males and 32 females, aged 18-76 (45±15) years. Based on the fact whether patients’ conditions had deteriorated into severe type, all the cases were divided into common type group (51 cases) and deteriorated type group (13 cases). Differences of CT findings in the two groups of patients were analyzed, and visual semi-quantitative scores were introduced to evaluate the pneumonia. Results: Compared with the common type group, the deteriorated type group was more likely to involve the left upper lobe, the right middle lobe and the lung far away from the pleura. The differences between the two groups were statistically significant (χ²= 5.897, P=0.027; χ²=8.549, P=0.005; χ²=10.169,P=0.002). The median of the involved lobes were 2 (1,5) in the common type group and 5 (4,5) in the deteriorated type group. The difference between the two groups was statistically significant (Z =-3.303, P=0.001). Taking the involved lobes (n=4) as the threshold, the sensitivity and specificity of the diagnosis of the common type to the deteriorated type patients were the highest, 76.9% and 74.5% respectively, and the area under the ROC curve was 0.787. Pneumonia score of the deteriorated group was 10 (4,16), higher than that of the common group [4 (1,13)], and the difference was statistically significant (Z=-4.040, P&lt;0.001). Pneumonia score 8 as the threshold, the sensitivity and specificity of the general severe group were the highest, 69.2% and 86.3% respectively, and the area under ROC curve was 0.863. Conclusions: CT imaging has a profound value in the early prediction of deterioration in clinical type of COVID-19. It can help evaluate the severity of pneumonia in early stage.

The survey was posted online to the AARConnect management, education, adult acute care, neonatal/pediatrics, COVID-19, and help line communities. Data analysis was descriptive. Key drivers of burnout among RTs were identified from qualitative answers. RESULTS: There were 221 responses, and 72% reported experiencing burnout. Ten percent of the departments that responded measured burnout; 36% utilized resilience tools, and 83% offered free employee assistance for those struggling with burnout. In January 2020, 30% of departments reported an estimated burnout rate > 40%, which increased to 44% of departments (P = .007) in the COVID-19 pandemic period. The most common drivers reported were poor leadership (32%), high work load (31%), and staffing (29%); 93% of respondents agreed that burnout is a major problem in health care, 33% agreed that burnout is primarily driven by external factors, 92% agreed that RTs have a similar risk of burnout as other health care professionals, 73% agreed that they were comfortable discussing challenging situations with colleagues, 32% agreed that their leadership provided adequate support for those suffering from burnout, and 79% agreed that they would be open to utilizing resilience tools from the AARC or other professional organizations. CONCLUSIONS: Most respondents experienced burnout and few respiratory care departments measured burnout. Resilience resources were not commonly used but employee assistance and wellness programs were common. Key drivers of burnout identified were poor leadership, staffing, and high workloads.","Miller, Andrew G; Roberts, Karsten J; Hinkson, Carl R; Davis, Gabrielle; Strickland, Shawna L; Rehder, Kyle J",Respir. care,,402

The smart-testing ideas presented here are motivated by active learning and multi-armed bandit techniques in machine learning. Our active sampling method works in conjunction with quarantine policies, can handle different objectives, is dynamic and adaptive in the sense that it continually adapts to changes in real-time data. The bandit algorithm uses contact tracing, location-based sampling and random sampling in order to select specific individuals to test. Using a data-driven agent-based model simulating New York City we show that the algorithm samples individuals to test in a manner that rapidly traces infected individuals. Experiments also suggest that smart-testing can significantly reduce the death rates as compared to current methods such as testing symptomatic individuals with or without contact tracing.","Wang, Yingfei; Yahav, Inbal; Padmanabhan, Balaji",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.13483v1.pdf,402
276970,Anticoagulation Management and Outcomes in Covid-19 Patients:a Multi-Center Retrospective Cohort Study,2020,"BACKGROUND: Laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC) is the accepted standard treatment for acute cholecystitis (AC) in patients eligible for surgery. Percutaneous cholecystostomy (PC) can provide a permanent treatment for high-risk patients for surgery or act as a bridge for later surgical treatment. This study is an evaluation of the use of PC during the current coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic at a single hospital. METHODS: Fifty patients with AC were admitted as of the start of the COVID-19 pandemic in Turkey through June 2020. Patients with pancreatitis, cholangitis, and/or incomplete data were excluded from the study. Data of the remaining 36 patients included in the study were recorded and a descriptive statistical analysis was performed. The patients were divided into three groups: PC (n=14), only conservative treatment with antibiotherapy (OC) (n=14), and LC (n=8). The findings were compared with a group of 70 similar patients from the pre-pandemic period. RESULTS: The mean age of the pandemic period patients was 53 years (range: 26-78 years). The female/male ratio was 1.11. PC was preferred in eight (11%) patients in the same period of the previous year, whereas 14 (39%) patients underwent PC in the pandemic period. Four of the 36 pandemic patients were positive for COVID-19, including one member of the PC group. There was one (7.1%) mortality in the pandemic-period PC group due to cardiac arrest. The length of hospital stay between the groups based on the type of treatment was not statistically significant. CONCLUSION: LC is not recommended during the pandemic period; PC can be an effective and safe alternative for the treatment of AC.","Somuncu, Erkan; Kara, Yasin; Kizilkaya, Mehmet Celal; Bozdag, Emre; Yildiz, Zeynep Betül; Özkan, Cenk; Sener, Aziz; Gökay, Ridvan; Aydin, Mahmut Ozan; Bozkurt, Mehmet Abdussamet; Kocatas, Ali",Ulus Travma Acil Cerrahi Derg,,402

The survey was conducted on February 18, 2020, among 7,716 voluntary participants from 143 medical institutions in Zhejiang, China. The findings indicated that KAP of nursing staff scored well. However, the accuracy of psychological nursing knowledge was much lower, 14.3% only. Nursing staff working in isolation wards have higher knowledge (OR = 1.776, 95% CI: 1.491-2.116), attitude (OR = 1.542, 95% CI: 1.298-1.832), and practice (OR = 1.902, 95% CI: 1.590-2.274) scores than those in general wards.

278738,Impact of cardiovascular risk profile on COVID-19 outcome. A meta-analysis,2020,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infects cells through interaction of its spike protein (SARS2-S) with angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and activation by proteases, in particular transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2). Viruses can also spread through fusion of infected with uninfected cells. We compared the requirements of ACE2 expression, proteolytic activation, and sensitivity to inhibitors for SARS2-S-mediated and SARS-CoV-S (SARS1-S)-mediated cell-cell fusion. SARS2-S-driven fusion was moderately increased by TMPRSS2 and strongly by ACE2, while SARS1-S-driven fusion was strongly increased by TMPRSS2 and less so by ACE2 expression. In contrast to that of SARS1-S, SARS2-S-mediated cell-cell fusion was efficiently activated by batimastat-sensitive metalloproteases. Mutation of the S1/S2 proteolytic cleavage site reduced effector cell-target cell fusion when ACE2 or TMPRSS2 was limiting and rendered SARS2-S-driven cell-cell fusion more dependent on TMPRSS2. When both ACE2 and TMPRSS2 were abundant, initial target cell-effector cell fusion was unaltered compared to that of wild-type (wt) SARS2-S, but syncytia remained smaller. Mutation of the S2 cleavage (S2') site specifically abrogated activation by TMPRSS2 for both cell-cell fusion and SARS2-S-driven pseudoparticle entry but still allowed for activation by metalloproteases for cell-cell fusion and by cathepsins for particle entry. Finally, we found that the TMPRSS2 inhibitor bromhexine, unlike the inhibitor camostat, was unable to reduce TMPRSS2-activated cell-cell fusion by SARS1-S and SARS2-S. Paradoxically, bromhexine enhanced cell-cell fusion in the presence of TMPRSS2, while its metabolite ambroxol exhibited inhibitory activity under some conditions. On Calu-3 lung cells, ambroxol weakly inhibited SARS2-S-driven lentiviral pseudoparticle entry, and both substances exhibited a dose-dependent trend toward weak inhibition of authentic SARS-CoV-2.IMPORTANCE Cell-cell fusion allows viruses to infect neighboring cells without the need to produce free virus and contributes to tissue damage by creating virus-infected syncytia. Our results demonstrate that the S2' cleavage site is essential for activation by TMPRSS2 and unravel important differences between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, among those, greater dependence of SARS-CoV-2 on ACE2 expression and activation by metalloproteases for cell-cell fusion. Bromhexine, reportedly an inhibitor of TMPRSS2, is currently being tested in clinical trials against coronavirus disease 2019. Our results indicate that bromhexine enhances fusion under some conditions. We therefore caution against the use of bromhexine in high dosages until its effects on SARS-CoV-2 spike activation are better understood. The related compound ambroxol, which similarly to bromhexine is clinically used as an expectorant, did not exhibit activating effects on cell-cell fusion. Both compounds exhibited weak inhibitory activity against SARS-CoV-2 infection at high concentrations, which might be clinically attainable for ambroxol.","Hörnich, Bojan F; Großkopf, Anna K; Schlagowski, Sarah; Tenbusch, Matthias; Kleine-Weber, Hannah; Neipel, Frank; Stahl-Hennig, Christiane; Hahn, Alexander S",J. virol,,402
278924,Estimating Mortality in Patients with Hematological Malignancy and COVID-19: A Pooled Analysis of 10 Studies,2020,"Wheelchairs can significantly improve quality of life for those who need them, yet access to physiotherapists or occupational therapists specialising in wheelchair and seating assessment can be difficult, especially for Mäori. This paper reports on a national online survey that was undertaken as phase 1 of a mixed methods study of key stakeholders of the perceived social and technical requirements of a telehealth wheelchair assessment service for people with complex mobility needs. Key stakeholders included wheelchair users and their families, specialist and non-specialist assessors, technicians, and service managers. Responses (n = 114) indicated perceived shortcomings with current in-person assessment. Telehealth assessment was anticipated to improve service quality, particularly the timeliness of services (52/92, 57%) and prioritisation of the urgency of assessment (71/92, 77%). Preferences were for use of existing software rather than bespoke systems. Training in conducting assessment via telehealth was considered essential by most assessors (29/41, 71%). Internet connectivity was in place for most wheelchair users (43/47, 92%) but was inadequate for 29% (14/49) of assessors (pre-COVID-19). Mäori wheelchair users largely had infrastructure in place for telehealth assessment (10/11, 91%) and held positive expectations of it. Telehealth wheelchair and seating assessment is anticipated to improve the quality of care for wheelchair users with complex needs. Upgraded technical capability of public health services and robust training in conducting assessment via telehealth will be critical to successful uptake of this service. Specific needs for Mäori wheelchair users warrant further investigation. © 2021, Physiotherapy New Zealand. All rights reserved.","Graham, F.; Boland, P.; Wallace, S.; Taylor, W.

Media coverage has proffered explanations for this differential vulnerability, but psychosocial risk factors have been largely ignored. In contrast, multiple theories, medical and psychological, point to one psychosocial factor - stress - as important to the etiology of disease. They also agree that pathogenic stress arises from the particular circumstance in which adaptational demands overwhelm a person's resources, creating ""stress overload"" that deregulates normal functioning and increases susceptibility to illness. Assessment of stress overload is proposed as essential to understanding viral spread in the current pandemic. Methods: Studies are reviewed explicating (1) stress overload theories and relevant empirical evidence, (2) construction of a stress overload measure and related validity evidence. Results: Findings support the role of stress overload in illness and the accuracy of the measure in predicting illness. Conclusion: It is concluded that assessment of stress overload may help to explain the observed coronavirus disparities, and to identify populations at risk for imminent infection. The 10-item Stress Overload Scale-Short is offered as a potentially useful tool for researchers and clinicians working to map, and stem, the proliferation of coronavirus.","Amirkhan, James H",Anxiety Stress Coping,,402

Two different isomeric Pt (II)-porphyrins were synthetized and applied. PDI experiments in the strains of Mycobacteroides abscessus subsp. Abscessus (ATCC 19977), Mycolicibacterium fortuitum (ATCC 6841), Mycobacteroides abscessus subsp.

The present results show that positively charged porphyrins at the meta position (3-PtTPyP) are more efficient PS against M. abscessus, M. fortuitum, M. massiliense, and M. smegmatis. The effectiveness of the molecule as PS for PDI studies is also clear with mycobacteria, which is strongly related with the porphyrin peripheral charge and coordination platinum (II) compounds and consequently their solubility in physiological media. Tetra-cationic PS may be promising anti-mycobacterial PDI agents with potential applications in medical clinical cases and bioremediation.","Rossi, Grazielle Guidolin; Guterres, Kevim Bordignon; da Silveira, Carolina Hahn; Moreira, Kelly Schneider; Burgo, Thiago Augusto Lima; Iglesias, Bernardo Almeida; de Campos, Marli Matiko Anraku",Microb Pathog,,402

Obviously, this will be done using a variety of analytical methods and using different antigens, including peptides. In this work, we compare three method variations for detecting specific immunoglobulins directed against peptides of approximately 15-aa of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. These linear peptide epitopes were selected using antigenicity algorithms, and were synthesized with an additional terminal cysteine residue for their bioconjugation. In two of the methods, constructs were prepared where the peptide (F, function) is attached to a negatively charged hydrophilic spacer (S) linked to a dioleoylphosphatidyl ethanolamine residue (L, lipid) to create a function-spacer-lipid construct (FSL). These FSLs were easily and controllably incorporated into erythrocytes for serologic testing or in a lipid bilayer deposited on a polystyrene microplate for use in an enzyme immunoassays (EIA). The third method, also an EIA, used polyacrylamide conjugated peptides (peptide-PAA) prepared by controlled condensation of the cysteine residue of the peptide with the maleimide-derived PAA polymer which were immobilized on polystyrene microplates by physisorption of the polymer. In this work, we describe the synthesis of the PAA and FSL peptide bioconjugates, design of test systems, and comparison of the bioassays results, and discuss potential reasons for higher performance of the FSL conjugates, particularly in the erythrocyte-based serologic assay.","Ryzhov, Ivan M; Tuzikov, Alexander B; Nizovtsev, Alexey V; Baidakova, Ludmila K; Galanina, Oxana E; Shilova, Nadezhda V; Ziganshina, Marina M; Dolgushina, Nataliya V; Bayramova, Guldana R; Sukhikh, Gennady T; Williams, Eleanor C; Nagappan, Radhika; Henry, Stephen M; Bovin, Nicolai V",Bioconjug Chem,,402

Here, we report atomic layer deposition of boron nitride (ALD-BN) using BCl3 and NH3 precursors directly on thermal SiO2 substrates at a relatively low temperature of 600 °C. The films were characterized by x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, atomic force microscopy, and transmission electron microscopy wherein the uniform, atomically smooth, and nanocrystalline layered-BN thin film growth is observed. The growth rate is ~0.042 nm/cycle at 600 °C, a temperature significantly lower than that of h-BN grown by chemical vapor deposition (CVD). The dielectric properties of the ALD-BN measured from Metal Oxide Semiconductor Capacitors (MOSCAPs) are comparable with that of SiO2. Moreover, the ALD-BN exhibits a two-fold increase in carrier mobility of graphene field effect transistors (G-FETs/ALD-BN/SiO2) due to the less surface charge density and inert surface of ALD-BN in comparison to that of G-FETs fabricated on bare SiO2. Therefore, this work suggests that the transfer-free deposition of ALD-BN on SiO2 may be a promising candidate as a substrate for high performance graphene devices.","Lee, Jaebeom; Ravichandran, Arul Vigneswar; Mohan, Jaidah; Cheng, Lanxia; Lucero, Antonio T; Zhu, Hui; Che, Zifan; Catalano, Massimo; Kim, Moon J; Wallace, Robert M; Venugopal, Archana; Choi, Woong; Colombo, Luigi; Kim, Jiyoung",ACS appl. mater. interfaces (Online),,402

294735,PERTinent new insights into venous thromboembolism risk and management in hospitalized patients with COVID-19,2021,"The transmission of pathogens from wild animals to humans is called ""zoonotic spillover"". Most human infectious diseases (60-75%) are derived from pathogens that originally circulated in non-human animal species. This demonstrates that spillover has a fundamental role in the emergence of new human infectious diseases. Understanding the factors that facilitate the transmission of pathogens from wild animals to humans is essential to establish strategies focused on the reduction of the frequency of spillover events. In this context, this article describes the basic aspects of zoonotic spillover and the main factors involved in spillover events, considering the role of the inter-species interactions, phylogenetic distance between host species, environmental drivers, and specific characteristics of the pathogens, animals, and humans. As an example, the factors involved in the emergence of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic are discussed, indicating what can be learned from this public health emergency, and what can be applied to the Brazilian scenario. Finally, this article discusses actions to prevent or reduce the frequency of zoonotic spillover events.","Ellwanger, J. H.; Chies, J. A. B.",Genetics &amp; Molecular Biology,,402

This cross-sectional study aims to assess the effects of COVID-19 on the psychological wellbeing of mental health workers who provide care to a vulnerable patient population that have been particularly affected during this crisis. A total of 387 HCWs from across a large urban mental health service completed a self-administered questionnaire consisting of socio-demographic, lifestyle and work-based information and validated psychometric scales. Depression and anxiety were measured using the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) and the Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale (GAD-7), respectively; sleep problems with the Athens Insomnia Scale (AIS); burnout with the Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI); and resilience with the Resilience Scale-14 (RS-14). Multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed to determine potential mediating factors. Prevalence of burnout was notable, with 52% recording moderate/severe in Emotional Exhaustion, 19.5% moderate/severe in Depersonalisation, and 55.5% low/moderate Personal Accomplishment. Over half of all respondents (52%) experienced sleep problems; the presence of depressive symptoms was a significant predictor of insomnia. An increase in potentially harmful lifestyle changes, such as smoking, alcohol consumption and overeating was also observed. However, high Resilience was reported by 70% of the samples and the importance of this is highlighted. Female gender was associated with increased levels of depression and emotional exhaustion while those with a history of mental health conditions were most at risk of affective symptoms, insomnia, and burnout. Overall, our study revealed considerable levels of psychological distress and maladaptive coping strategies but also resilience and satisfaction with organizational support provided.

If the language used in video messages is not clear or understandable to deaf and hard of hearing (DHH) people with a high school degree or less, this can cause confusion and result in information gaps among DHH people during a health emergency. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to investigate the relationship between DHH people's perception of the effectiveness of physical distancing and contagiousness of an asymptomatic person. METHODS: This is a cross-sectional survey study on DHH people's perceptions about COVID-19 (N=475). Items pertaining to COVID-19 knowledge were administered to US deaf adults from April 17, 2020, to May 1, 2020, via a bilingual American Sign Language/English online survey platform. RESULTS: The sample consisted of 475 DHH adults aged 18-88 years old, with 74% (n=352) identifying as White and 54% (n=256) as female. About 88% (n=418) of the sample felt they knew most things or a lot about physical distancing. This figure dropped to 72% (n=342) for the question about the effectiveness of physical distancing in reducing the spread of COVID-19 and 70% (n=333) for the question about the contagiousness of an infected person without symptoms. Education and a knowledge of the effectiveness of physical distancing significantly predicted knowledge about the contagiousness of an asymptomatic individual. Race, gender, and age did not emerge as significant predictors. CONCLUSIONS: This results of this study point to the strong connection between education and coronavirus-related knowledge. Education-related disparities can be remedied by making information fully accessible and easily understood during emergencies and pandemics.","Paludneviciene, Raylene; Knight, Tracy; Firl, Gideon; Luttrell, Kaela; Takayama, Kota; Kushalnagar, Poorna",J Med Internet Res,,402
300060,COVID-19 WHO African Region: External situation report 25 / 2020,2020,"The growing number of industrial carbon emissions have resulted in a significant increase in the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide (CO2), which, in turn, will have a major impact on climate change. Therefore, the reduction, storage, and reuse of CO2 is an important concern in modern society. Calcium oxide (CaO) is known to be an excellent adsorbent of CO2 in a high-temperature environment. However, since deterioration of the adsorbent is likely to occur after repeated cycles of adsorption under high temperature conditions, it would be desirable to mitigate this phenomenon, in order to maintain the stability of CaO. In the present study, common eggshell waste was used as the starting material. The main component of eggshell waste is calcium carbonate (CaCO3), which was purified to produce CaO. Different surfactants and amino-containing polymers were added to synthesize CaO-based adsorbents with different configurations and pore sizes. The amount of CO2 adsorbed was determined using a thermogravimetric analyzer (TGA). The results showed that the CO2 adsorption capacity of the synthetic CaO recovered from purified eggshell waste could reach 0.6 g-CO2/g-sorbent, indicating a good adsorption capacity. CaO modified with a dopamine-containing polymer was shown to have an adsorption capacity of 0.62 g-CO2/g-sorbent. Moreover, it showed an excellent adsorption capacity of 0.40 g-CO2/g-sorbent, even after 10 cycles of CO2 adsorption. The present study suggests that using eggshell waste to synthesize CaO-based adsorbents for effective CO2 adsorption can not only reduce environmental waste, but also have the potential to capture greenhouse gas CO2 emissions, which conforms to the principles of green chemistry.","Hsieh, Shu-Ling; Li, Fang-Yu; Lin, Pei-Ying; Beck, David E; Kirankumar, Rajendranath; Wang, Gan-Jie; Hsieh, Shuchen",J Environ Manage,,402

However, most of the current pyroptosis inducers lack cell selectivity, which may cause severe side effects for cancer therapy. In this work, for the first time, the authors discovered that the commonly used near-infrared (NIR) fluorogenic hemicyanine (CyNH2 ) induces pyrolysis to kill cancer cells and boost antitumor immunity. Cancer cells overexpressing the NAD(P)H: quinone oxidoreductase isozyme 1 (NQO1)-responsive theranostic (NCyNH2 ) are designed for selective cell pyroptosis and are nonfluorescent with low toxicity before activation. In the presence of NQO1, the fluorescence of CyNH2 is restored and can selectively initiate pyroptosis of cancer cells and further lead to systemic antitumor immunity activation for solid tumor therapy. Thus, this fluorogenic NIR dye may represent a novel theranostic agent for the selective initiation of tumor pyroptosis.","Wang, Kewei; Xiao, Xuan; Jiang, Maolin; Li, Jisi; Zhou, Jielian; Yuan, Youyong",Small,,402

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of pandemic-related factors on the severity and course of chronic urticaria (CU). METHODS: A total of 194 CU patients who were on regular follow-up, were enrolled in the study. The disease activity was assessed by means of the weekly urticaria activity score (UAS7) and urticaria control test (UCT). Patients were divided into two subgroups according to their disease aggravation as ""aggravated"" and ""non-aggravated"". Two groups were compared in terms of demographic, clinical, COVID-19-associated parameters, and parameters related with the effect of COVID-19 pandemic on CU management. RESULTS: The omalizumab use was statistically higher (P = .017), and the systemic corticosteroid use was statistically lower (P = .025) in the ""aggravated"" group. Adherence to quarantine was significantly lower in the 'aggravated' group (P = .027). 173 patients (89.2%) were unable to contact a dermatologist during the pandemic. Among 186 patients who received treatment for CU before the pandemic, 48 (25.8%) did not continue the existing treatment during the pandemic. CU aggravated in one patient with COVID-19 and remained stable in the other. CONCLUSION: The present study showed that CU patients, especially those on omalizumab therapy, had difficulties in attending medical care and even in the maintenance of their existing therapies during the pandemic. Creating novel follow-up and treatment models as well as the increased use of teledermatology might be beneficial in the management of this life-disturbing condition.","Erdem, Yasemin; Polat Ekinci, Algün; Altunay, Ilknur Kivanc; Sivaz, Onur; Inal, Sena; Gokalp, Mehmet Onur; Pehlivan, Gizem; Özkaya, Esen",Dermatol. ther,,402

304372,"Presenting the characteristics, smoking versus diabetes, and outcome among patients hospitalized with COVID-19",2020,"Preparedness for the ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and its spread in India calls for setting up of adequately equipped and dedicated health facilities to manage sick patients while protecting healthcare workers and the environment. In the wake of other emerging dangerous pathogens in recent times, such as Ebola, Nipah and Zika, it is important that such facilities are kept ready during the inter-epidemic period for training of health professionals and for managing cases of multi-drug resistant and difficult-to-treat pathogens. While endemic potential of such critically ill patients is not yet known, the health system should have surge capacity for such critical care units and preferably each tertiary government hospital should have at least one such facility. This article describes elements of design of such unit (e.g., space, infection control, waste disposal, safety of healthcare workers, partners to be involved in design and plan) which can be adapted to the context of either a new construction or makeshift construction on top of an existing structure. In view of a potential epidemic of COVID-19, specific requirements to handle it are also given.","Agarwal, Anup; Nagi, Nazia; Chatterjee, Pranab; Sarkar, Swarup; Mourya, Devendra; Sahay, Rima Rakeshkumar; Bhatia, Rajesh",Indian J.

The first cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection occurred in November 19 in Wuhan, China. Preventive measures taken have not prevented the rapid spread of the virus to countries around the world. To date, there are approximately 3 million deaths, and a massive worldwide vaccination campaign has recently begun. SARS-CoV-2 uses the ACE-2 protein as an intracellular carrier. ACE-2 is a key component of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS), a key regulator of cardiovascular function. Considering the key role of ACE-2 in COVID-19 infection, both as an entry receptor and as a protective role, especially for the respiratory tract, and considering the variations of ACE-2 during the phases of viral infection, it is clear the important role that pharmacological regulation of RAS and ACE-2 may take. In this article, we describe the importance of ACE-2 in COVID-19 infection, the pharmacological aspects of a modulation with RAS-modifying agents, new therapeutic strategies, trying to provide a deep understanding and explanation of the complex mechanisms underlying the relationship between the virus and ACE-2, providing opinions and personal hypotheses on the best strategies of therapeutic intervention.","Ferrara, Francesco; Vitiello, Antonio",Naunyn Schmiedebergs Arch Pharmacol,,402

Up to now, laboratory real-time PCR is the standard of care, but requires a fully equipped laboratory and significant infrastructure. Consequently, new diagnostic tools are required. METHODS: In the present work, the diagnostic accuracy of the point-of-care rapid test ""bKIT Virus Finder COVID-19"" (Hyris Ltd) is evaluated by a retrospective and a prospective analysis on SARS CoV-2 samples previously assessed with an FDA ""authorized for the emergency use-EUA"" reference method. Descriptive statistics were used for the present study. RESULTS: Results obtained with the Hyris Kit are the same as that of standard laboratory-based real time PCR methods for all the analyzed samples. In addition, the Hyris Kit provides the test results in less than 2 h, a significantly shorter time compared to the reference methods, without the need of a fully equipped laboratory.

312228,Risk factors of mortality and contribution of treatment in patients infected with COVID-19: a retrospective propensity score matched study,2020,"Development of effective counteragents against the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) strains, requires clear insights and information for understanding the immune responses associated with it. This global pandemic has pushed the healthcare system and restricted the movement of people and succumbing of the available therapeutics utterly warrants the development of a potential vaccine to contest the deadly situation. In the present study, highly efficacious, immunodominant cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) epitopes were predicted by advanced immunoinformatics assays using the spike glycoprotein of SARS-CoV2, generating a robust and specific immune response with convincing immunological parameters (Antigenicity, TAP affinity, MHC binder) engendering an efficient viral vaccine. The molecular docking studies show strong binding of the CTL construct with MHC-1 and host membrane specific TLR2 receptors. The molecular dynamics simulation in an explicit system confirmed the stable and robust binding of CTL epitope with TLR2. Steep magnitude RMSD variation and compelling residual fluctuations existed in terminal residues and various loops of the ß linker segments of TLR2-epitope (residues 105-156 and 239-254) to about 0.4 nm. The reduced Rg value (3.3 nm) and stagnant SASA analysis (275 nm/S2/N after 8 ns and 5 ns) for protein surface and its orientation in the exposed and buried regions suggests more compactness due to the strong binding interaction of the epitope. The CTL vaccine candidate establishes a high capability to elicit the critical immune regulators, like T-cells and memory cells as proven by the in silico immunization assays and can be further corroborated through in vitro and in vivo assays.","Kumar, Neeraj; Admane, Nikita; Kumari, Anchala; Sood, Damini; Grover, Sonam; Prajapati, Vijay Kumar; Chandra, Ramesh; Grover, Abhinav",Sci Rep,,402

Materials and Methods: Patients with laboratory and clinically confirmed COVID-19 infection were enrolled in this longitudinal study. They were managed in either the inpatient or outpatient setting. The demographic, clinical, and outcome data were retrieved from patients’ medical records. Olfactory dysfunction features, including the onset pattern, duration, and recovery time were investigated. The visual analog scale (VAS) was utilized as a self-rating subjective measurement of olfactory function. Results: According to the results, the mean age of the patients (n=502) was obtained at 46.8±18.5 years;moreover, 52.4% and 47.6% of cases were female and male, respectively. It was also revealed that 35.4% and 64.5% of the subjects were outpatients and hospitalized, respectively. Based on the findings, 178 (38.4%) subjects had olfactory dysfunction. The mean values of VAS in hyposmic patients were estimated at 2.5±2.5, 8.3 ±2.1, and 9.4±1.6 at the first evaluation, in 2 weeks, and after 1 month of follow-up (P&lt;0.001). The onset of olfactory dysfunction was more suddenly (58.7%). The majority of cases experienced olfactory dysfunction at the same time as other symptoms 72(51.1%). Based on the results, 0.4% of subjects infected with COVID-19 had olfactory dysfunction as an isolated symptom. The olfactory dysfunction was recovered after 2 weeks in 18 (25.3%) anosmic and 37(46.8%) hyposmic patients. Conclusion: Olfactory dysfunction seemed to be an important symptom of COVID-19 infection.

Currently, long-term data on viral shedding and the serum antibody responses in COVID-19 patients are still limited. Herein, we report the clinical features, viral RNA loads, and serum antibody levels in a cohort of 112 COVID-19 patients admitted to the Honghu People's Hospital, Hubei Province, China. Overall, 5.36% (6/112) of patients showed persistent viral RNA shedding (> 45 days). The peak viral load was higher in the severe disease group than in the mild group (median cycle threshold value, 36.4 versus 31.5; P = 0.002). For most patients the disappearance of IgM antibodies occurred approximately 4-6 weeks after symptoms onset, while IgG persisted for over 194 days after the onset of symptoms, although patients showed a 46% reduction in antibodies titres against SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein compared with the acute phase. We also studied 18 asymptomatic individuals with RT-qPCR confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection together with 17 symptomatic patients, and the asymptomatic individuals were the close contacts of these symptomatic cases. Delayed IgG seroconversion and lower IgM seropositive rates were observed in asymptomatic individuals. These data indicate that higher viral loads and stronger antibody responses are related to more severe disease status in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection, and the antibodies persisted in the recovered patient for more than 6 months so that the vaccine may provide protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Zhang, Xiaoyong; Lu, Suwen; Li, Hui; Wang, Yi; Lu, Zhen; Liu, Zhihong; Lai, Qingtao; Ji, Yali; Huang, Xuan; Li, Yongyin; Sun, Jian; Wu, Yingsong; Xu, Xiaoning; Hou, Jinlin",Virol Sin,,402

316115,A Case Series Describing the Recurrence of COVID-19 in Patients Who Recovered from Initial Illness in Bangladesh,2021,"Non-invasive remote health monitoring plays a vital role in epidemiological situations such as SARS outbreak (2003), MERS (2015) and the recently ongoing outbreak of COVID-19 because it is extremely risky to get close to the patient due to the spread of contagious infections. Non-invasive monitoring is also extremely necessary in situations where it is difficult to use complicated wired connections, such as ECG monitoring for infants, burn victims or during rescue missions when people are buried during building collapses/earthquakes. Due to the unique characteristics such as higher penetration capabilities, extremely precise ranging, low power requirement, low cost, simple hardware and robustness to multipath interferences, Impulse Radio Ultra Wideband (IR-UWB) technology is appropriate for non-invasive medical applications. IR-UWB sensors detect the macro as well as micro movement inside the human body due to its fine range resolution. The two vital signs, i.e., respiration rate and heart rate, can be measured by IR-UWB radar by measuring the change in the magnitude of signal due to displacement caused by human lungs, heart during respiration and heart beating. This paper reviews recent advances in IR- UWB radar sensor design for healthcare, such as vital signs measurements of a stationary human, vitals of a non-stationary human, vital signs of people in a vehicle, through the wall vitals measurement, neonate's health monitoring, fall detection, sleep monitoring and medical imaging. Although we have covered many topics related to health monitoring using IR-UWB, this paper is mainly focused on signal processing techniques for measurement of vital signs, i.e., respiration and heart rate monitoring.","Khan, Faheem; Ghaffar, Asim; Khan, Naeem; Cho, Sung Ho",Sensors (Basel),,402
316563,N-Terminal Pro-B-Type Natriuretic Peptide and Mortality in Patients without Heart Failure Hospitalized with Severe Covid-19 Pneumonia,2020,"Multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) have been widely used in sewage disposal, water purification, and disinfection. Co-exposure to MWCNTs and heavy metal ions is common during water disposal. However, the hepatotoxicity of co-exposure to MWCNTs and lead ions for nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) subjects has not been investigated. NAFLD mice were fed intragastrically with MWCNTs and lead acetate (PbAc). Combined administration of MWCNTs and PbAc significantly damaged the liver function, and aggravated the nonalcoholic steatohepatitis phenotype as well as the hepatic fibrosis and steatosis in NAFLD mice. Furthermore, MWCNTs and PbAc significantly induced apoptosis in primary hepatocytes isolated from NAFLD mice. Combined administration of MWCNTs and PbAc also resulted in hepatic lipid peroxidation by inducing antioxidant defense system dysfunction, and significantly enhanced the expression levels of inflammatory cytokines in NAFLD mice livers. Meanwhile, combined administration of MWCNTs and PbAc may exert its hepatotoxicity in the NAFLD via inhibiting the adenosine 5'-monophosphate activated protein kinase (AMPK)/peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors Î³ (PPARÎ³) pathway. Taken together, we conclude that co-exposure to MWCNTs and PbAc can remarkably aggravate the hepatotoxicity in NAFLD mice via inhibiting the AMPK/PPARÎ³ pathway. This study may provide a biosafety evaluation for the application of nanomaterials in wastewater treatment.","Liu, Enqin; Wang, Xinghui; Li, Xidong; Tian, Ping; Xu, Hao; Li, Zenglian; Wang, Likun","Aging (Albany, N.Y.

Evidence suggests that individuals previously exposed to traumatic events, and particularly to continuous traumatic stress (CTS), might be more vulnerable to distress when facing additional stressors. This study aimed to investigate these suppositions in the context of the ongoing shelling of Israel from the Israel-Gaza border, which continues even amidst the COVID-19 crisis. METHOD: An online survey was conducted among Israel's general population. The sample included 976 participants. Seven-hundred-and-ninety-three participants had been exposed to traumatic events, with 255 participants reporting CTS. Trauma exposure, COVID-19-related stressors, and psychological distress related to COVID-19 (anxiety, depression, and peritraumatic stress symptoms) were assessed. RESULTS: Most participants reported experiencing at least one psychiatric symptom related to COVID-19. Being younger, female, not in a relationship, having a below-average income, being diagnosed with the disease, living alone during the outbreak, having a close other in a high-risk group, and negatively self-rating one's health status were associated with elevated distress. Individuals who had been exposed to trauma, and to CTS in particular, had elevated anxiety, depression, and peritraumatic stress symptoms compared to individuals without such a history or to survivors of non-ongoing traumatic events. CTS moderated the relations between PTSD symptoms, anxiety symptoms, and peritraumatic stress symptoms, with significantly stronger relations found among individuals exposed to CTS. LIMITATIONS: This study relied on convenience sampling. CONCLUSIONS: Trauma survivors, and particularly traumatized individuals exposed to CTS, seem at risk for psychological distress related to COVID-19.","Lahav, Yael",J Affect Disord,,402

Therefore, whether the burden of COVID-19 is falling disproportionately on the shoulders of particular demographic groups is relatively unknown. In this article, we first provide an overview of the available geographic and demographic data related to COVID-19. We then make creative use of these existing data to fill the vacuum and identify key demographic risk factors for COVID-19 across Canada's health regions. Drawing on COVID-19 counts and tabular census data, we examine the association between communities' demographic composition and the number of COVID-19 infections. COVID-19 infections are higher in communities with larger shares of Black and low-income residents. Our approach offers a way for researchers and policymakers to use existing data to identify communities nationwide that are vulnerable to the pandemic in the absence of more detailed demographic and more granular geographic data.","Choi, Kate H; Denice, Patrick; Haan, Michael; Zajacova, Anna",Can Rev Sociol,,402

DESIGN: We used an exploratory sequential mixed-methods design to conduct patient needs assessments, a home telehealth pilot, and formative evaluation of the pilot. SETTING: Veterans Affairs geriatrics-renal clinic. PARTICIPANTS: Patients with scheduled clinic visits from October 2019 to April 2020. MEASUREMENTS: We conducted an in-person needs assessment and telephone postvisit interviews. RESULTS: Through 50 needs assessments, we identified patient-perceived barriers in interest, access to care, access to technology, and confidence. A total of 34 (68%) patients were interested in completing a home telehealth visit, but fewer (32 (64%)) had access to the necessary technology or were confident (21 (42%)) that they could participate. We categorized patients into four phenotypes based on their interest and capability to complete a home telehealth visit: interested and capable, interested and incapable, uninterested and capable, and uninterested and incapable. These phenotypes allowed us to create trainings to overcome patient-perceived barriers. We completed 32 home telehealth visits and 12 postvisit interviews. Our formative evaluation showed that our pilot was successful in addressing many patient-perceived barriers. All interviewees reported that the home telehealth visits improved their well-being. Home telehealth visits saved participants an average of 166 minutes of commute time. Five participants borrowed a device from a family member, and five visits were finished via telephone. All participants successfully completed a home telehealth visit. CONCLUSIONS: We identified patient-perceived barriers to home telehealth visits and classified patients into four phenotypes based on these barriers. Using principles of implementation science, our home telehealth pilot addressed these barriers, and all patients successfully completed a visit. Future study is needed to understand methods to deploy larger-scale efforts to integrate home telehealth visits into the care of older adults.","Hawley, Chelsea E; Genovese, Nicole; Owsiany, Montgomery T; Triantafylidis, Laura K; Moo, Lauren R; Linsky, Amy M; Sullivan, Jennifer L; Paik, Julie M",J. am. geriatr. soc,,402
321232,Baseline Demographics and Clinical Characteristics Among 3471 US Patients Hospitalized with COVID-19 and Pulmonary Involvement: A Retrospective Study,2020,"Resistance and tolerance are vital for survivability of the host-pathogen relationship. Virulence during Toxoplasma infection in mice is mediated by parasite kinase-dependent antagonism of IFN-Î³-induced host resistance. Whether avirulence requires expression of parasite factors that induce host tolerance mechanisms or is a default status reflecting the absence of resistance-interfering factors is not known. In this study, we present evidence that avirulence in Toxoplasma requires parasite engagement of the scavenger receptor CD36. CD36 promotes macrophage tropism but is dispensable for the development of resistance mechanisms. Instead CD36 is critical for re-establishing tissue homeostasis and survival following the acute phase of infection. The CD36-binding capacity of T. gondii strains is negatively controlled by the virulence factor, ROP18. Thus, the absence of resistance-interfering virulence factors and the presence of tolerance-inducing avirulence factors are both required for long-term host-pathogen survival.","Zhao, Yanlin; Reyes, Jojo; Rovira-Diaz, Eliezer; Fox, Barbara A; Bzik, David J; Yap, George S",J. immunol,,402

Mechanical ventilation is lifesaving for respiratory distress, this study was designed to delineate the clinical features of the coronavirus disease 2019 patients with mechanical ventilation from a national cohort in China. DESIGN: Prospective observational study. SETTING: The rapid spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 has infected more than 7.7 million people and caused more than 423,000 deaths. PATIENTS: Adult hospitalized coronavirus disease 2019 patients with mechanical ventilation from 557 hospitals from China. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: From a nationwide cohort, 141 coronavirus disease 2019 cases with mechanical ventilation were extracted from 1,590 cases. Cigarette smoke, advanced age, coexisting chronic illness, elevated systolic blood pressure, high body temperature, and abnormal laboratory findings are common in these ventilated cases. Multivariate regression analysis showed that higher odds of in-hospital death was associated with invasive mechanical ventilation requirement (hazard ratio: 2.95; 95% CI, 1.40-6.23; p = 0.005), and coexisting chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (hazard ratio, 4.57; 95% CI, 1.65-12.69; p = 0.004) and chronic renal disease (hazard ratio, 5.45; 95% CI, 1.85-16.12; p = 0.002). Compared with patients with noninvasive mechanical ventilation, patients who needs invasive mechanical ventilation showed higher rate of elevated D-dimer (> 1.5 mg/L) at admission (hazard ratio, 3.28, 95% CI, 1.07-10.10; p = 0.039). CONCLUSIONS: The potential risk factors of elevated D-dimer level could help clinicians to identify invasive mechanical ventilation requirement at an early stage, and coexisting chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or chronic renal disease are independent risk factors associated with fatal outcome in coronavirus disease 2019 patients with mechanical ventilation.","Wang, Tao; Tang, Chunli; Chen, Ruchong; Ruan, Honglian; Liang, Wenhua; Guan, Weijie; Sang, Ling; Tang, Ruidi; Zhong, Nanshan; Li, Shiyue",Crit Care Med,,402

All 167 infections could be traced back to the first index case. Daily sequential PCR testing of the quarantined subjects indicated that the viral loads of Delta infections, when they first become PCR+, were on average [~]1000 times greater compared to A/B lineage infections during initial epidemic wave in China in early 2020, suggesting potentially faster viral replication and greater infectiousness of Delta during early infection. We performed high-quality sequencing on samples from 126 individuals. Reliable epidemiological data meant that, for 111 transmission events, the donor and recipient cases were known. The estimated transmission bottleneck size was 1-3 virions with most minor intra-host single nucleotide variants (iSNVs) failing to transmit to the recipients. However, transmission heterogeneity of SARS-CoV-2 was also observed. The transmission of minor iSNVs resulted in at least 4 of the 30 substitutions identified in the outbreak, highlighting the contribution of intra-host variants to population level viral diversity during rapid spread. Disease control activities, such as the frequency of population testing, quarantine during pre-symptomatic infection, and level of virus genomic surveillance should be adjusted in order to account for the increasing prevalence of the Delta variant worldwide.","Li, Baisheng; Deng, Aiping; Li, Kuibiao; Hu, Yao; Li, Zhencui; Xiong, Qianling; Liu, Zhe; Guo, Qianfang; Zou, Lirong; Zhang, Huan; Zhang, Meng; Ouyang, Fangzhu; Su, Juan; Su, Wenzhe; Xu, Jing; Lin, Huifang; Sun, Jing; Peng, Jinju; Jiang, Huimin; Zhou, Pingping; Hu, Ting; Luo, Min; Zhang, Yingtao; Zheng, Huanying; Xiao, Jianpeng; Liu, Tao; Che, Rongfei; Zeng, Hanri; Zheng, Zhonghua; Huang, Yushi; Yu, Jianxiang; Yi, Lina; Wu, Jie; Chen, Jingdiao; Zhong, Haojie; Deng, Xiaoling; Kang, min; Pybus, Oliver G.; Hall, Matthew; Lythgoe, Katrina A.; Li, Yan; Yuan, Jun; He, Jianfeng; Lu, Jing",,,402

This study was conducted using a combination of solicited audio and written diaries, photography, and in-depth interviews with 16 participants, aged 22 to 58. The article provides a critical reflection on the incentives and deterrents to the UGS use of participants while social distancing measures were in place. The results show that in Mexico City: (1) participants' lack of access to UGS has hampered their use, mainly among those of low-income neighborhoods;(2) UGS size did not directly impact participants' UGS use during the pandemic;and (3) women were deterred from accessing UGS due to safety concerns related to the fear of violence. Overall, the results suggest that UGS use has served as a coping mechanism to decrease the effects of stress and isolation caused by the pandemic, increasing users' physical and mental well-being. This study's conclusions can help develop future citizen participation tools that are useful for resilience in urban design, as they provide interesting insights into the perceptions of residents, such as the most valued characteristics of UGS.","Mayen Huerta, C.; Cafagna, G.",International Journal of Environmental Research &amp; Public Health [Electronic Resource],,402

Till now, there is no drug molecule that has been convincingly identified as the inhibitor of the function of this protein. The current pandemic situation demands a shortcut to quickly reach to a lead compound or a drug, which may not be the best but might serve as an interim solution at least. Following this notion, the present investigation uses virtual screening to find a molecule which is alraedy approved as a drug for some other disease but could be repurposed to inhibit Mpro. The potential of the present method of work to identify such a molecule, which otherwise would have been missed out, lies in the fact that instead of just using the crystallographically identified conformation of the receptor's ligand binding pocket, molecular dynamics generated ensemble of conformations has been used. It implicitly included the possibilities of ""induced-fit"" and/or ""population shift"" mechanisms of ligand fitting. As a result, the investigation has not only identified antiviral drugs like ribavirin, ritonavir, etc., but it has also captured a wide variety of drugs for various other diseases like amrubicin, cangrelor, desmopressin, diosmin, etc. as the potent possibilities. Some of these ligands are versatile to form stable interactions with various different conformations of the receptor and therefore have been statistically surfaced in the investigation.

328328,Is it all in the heart? Myocardial injury as major predictor of mortality among hospitalized COVID-19 patients,2020,"Prolonged use of tight-fitting PPE, e.g., by COVID-19 healthcare workers leads to skin injuries. An important contributor is the shear exerted on the skin due to static friction at the skin-PPE interface. This study aims to develop an optimised wax-oil lubricant that reduces the friction, or shear, in the skin-PPE contact for up to four hours. Lubricants with different wax-oil combinations were prepared using beeswax, paraffin wax, olive oil, and mineral oil. In-vivo friction measurements involving seven participants were conducted by sliding a polydimethylsiloxane ball against the volar forearms to simulate the skin-PPE interface. The maximum static coefficient of friction was measured immediately and four hours after lubricant application. It was found that the coefficient of friction of wax-oil lubricants is mainly governed by the ratio of wax to oil and the thermal stability and morphology of the wax. To maintain long-term lubricity, it is crucial to consider the absorption of oil into the PPE material. The best performing lubricant is a mixture of 20 wt% beeswax, 40 wt% olive oil, and 40 wt% mineral oil, which compared to unlubricated skin, provides 87% (P = 0.0006) and 59% (P = 0.0015) reduction in instantaneous and 4-h coefficient of friction, respectively.","Yap, Kian Kun; Murali, Manoj; Tan, Zhengchu; Zhou, Xue; Li, Luli; Masen, Marc Arthur",Sci Rep,,402

They aim to ensure system reliability, electrical operation without interruptions and safety and protection for the users and system. In this sense, the knowledge of the main concepts associated with substations is essential for the training of students and engineers who work in this area. However, the development of substation courses and training by conventional methodologies does not allow an optimal integration with users. In general, technical visits are used as an auxiliary activity. However, it takes time, since it is usually far from urban centers, where educational institutions are located, and additionally, for safety reasons, it is not allowed being close to the equipment, especially in high voltage substations. In this context, the use of virtual reality may offer educational mechanisms for users to have improved knowledge retention and motivation. Thus, this paper presents a virtual substation as a teaching tool to complement substation courses and trainings. The present system mitigates the impact on the courses and training quality, when it is not possible or it’s difficult the access on site. For example, the scenarios caused by COVID-19, which imposes remote trainings and classes at companies and universities. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Silva, A.

These spillover events underlie the importance of detecting known and novel CoVs circulating in reservoir host species and determining CoV prevalence and distribution, allowing improved prediction of spillover events or where a human-reservoir interface should be closely monitored. To increase the likelihood of detecting all circulating genera and strains, we have modified primers published by Watanabe et al. in 2010 to generate a semi-nested pan-CoV PCR assay. Representatives from the four coronavirus genera (&#945;-CoVs, ß-CoVs, Î³-CoVs and Î´-CoVs) were tested and all of the in-house CoVs were detected using this assay. After comparing both assays, we found that the updated assay reliably detected viruses in all genera of CoVs with high sensitivity, whereas the sensitivity of the original assay was lower. Our updated PCR assay is an important tool to detect, monitor and track CoVs to enhance viral surveillance in reservoir hosts.","Holbrook, Myndi G; Anthony, Simon J; Navarrete-Macias, Isamara; Bestebroer, Theo; Munster, Vincent J; van Doremalen, Neeltje",Viruses,,402

The researchers suggested that high d-dimer levels could predict disease severity, lung complications, and thromboembolic events before they occur. Materials and Methods: We searched in PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science using the keywords ""D-dimer"" and ""coronavirus"" or ""D-dimer"" and ""COVID-19."" We used Standardized Mean Differences (SMD) to build forest plots of continuous data and assess differences in serum D-dimer concentrations between severe and non-severe patients with COVID-19 disease. We evaluated p-value < 0.05 as statistically significant and preferred 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Result: The pooled results of all studies revealed that the D-dimer concentrations were significantly higher in patients with more severe COVID-19 (SMD: 2.32 µg/mL; 95% CI, 0.72 3.92 µg/mL, p< 0.001). We evaluated severe patients with total D-dimer levels. D-dimer concentrations were significantly higher in severe patients against total COVID-19 patients (SMD: 2.01 µg/mL; 95% CI, 0.25 to 3.77 µg/mL, p= 0.08). Conclusions: We do not know the D-dimer increment mechanism in severe patients yet, but we think that these findings will be useful in the early diagnosis of severe disease and the first treatment.","Düz, Muhammed Emin; Balci, Aydin; Menekse, Elif",Tuberk Toraks,,402

335239,Rare radiological feature: lung cavitation due to coronavirus disease 2019 pneumonia,2021,"OBJECTIVE: Currently, little is known about the progression of an immune response against SARSCoV- 2 upon infection or sub-infection-exposure over time. We examined the serologic response in healthcare workers up to 12 weeks after a well-documented and contained outbreak and compared results with findings from earlier serologic testing in the same population. METHODS: This study followed 166 health care workers of the University Perinatal Care Center, Regensburg, Germany, for up to 12 weeks. 27 of the subjects had previously tested positive for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 by PCR testing and developed COVID-19. Serologic responses were tested with two independent commercially available test kits. RESULTS: 77.8 % of COVID-19 study subjects developed a specific IgG-response over the course of the 12-week study, while none of the COVID-19 contact groups had a detectable IgG response. Amongst most COVID-19 patients the values of detectable IgG-responses significantly increased over time as confirmed with both tests, while that of positive IgA responses decreased. Between the number of reported symptoms and antibody responses in COVID-19 patients no correlation was found and no new cases of seroconversion were identified in asymptomatic coworkers with negative PCR during the outbreak. CONCLUSIONS: Immune response after COVID-19 increases significantly over time but still approximately 22 % of COVID-19 patients did not mount a measurable serologic immune response within 60 days. Exposed co-workers did not develop any relevant antibody levels at all. We conclude that immunity after infection increases over time, but the antibody response does not develop reliably in all infected people.","Fill Malfertheiner, Sara; Brandstetter, Susanne; Roth, Samra; Harner, Susanne; Buntrock-Döpke, Heike; Toncheva, Antoaneta A; Borchers, Natascha; Gruber, Rudolf; Ambrosch, Andreas; Kabesch, Michael; Häusler, Sebastian",J Clin Virol,,402

335884,The rs738409 G Allele in PNPLA3 Is Associated With a Reduced Risk of COVID-19 Mortality and Hospitalization,2021,"OBJECTIVES: Clinical studies of chloroquine (CQ) and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) in COVID-19 disease reported conflicting results. We sought to systematically evaluate the effect of CQ and HCQ with or without azithromycin on outcomes of COVID-19 patients. METHODS: We searched multiple databases, preprints and grey literature up to 17 July 2020. We pooled only adjusted-effect estimates of mortality using a random-effect model. We summarized the effect of CQ or HCQ on viral clearance, ICU admission/mechanical ventilation and hospitalization. RESULTS: Seven randomized clinical trials (RCTs) and 14 cohort studies were included (20 979 patients). Thirteen studies (1 RCT and 12 cohort studies) with 15 938 hospitalized patients examined the effect of HCQ on short-term mortality. The pooled adjusted OR was 1.05 (95% CI 0.96-1.15, I2 = 0%). Six cohort studies examined the effect of the HCQ+azithromycin combination with a pooled adjusted OR of 1.32 (95% CI 1.00-1.75, I2 = 68.1%). Two cohort studies and four RCTs found no effect of HCQ on viral clearance. One small RCT demonstrated improved viral clearance with CQ and HCQ. Three cohort studies found that HCQ had no significant effect on mechanical ventilation/ICU admission. Two RCTs found no effect for HCQ on hospitalization risk in outpatients with COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: Moderate certainty evidence suggests that HCQ, with or without azithromycin, lacks efficacy in reducing short-term mortality in patients hospitalized with COVID-19 or risk of hospitalization in outpatients with COVID-19.","Kashour, Zakariya; Riaz, Muhammad; Garbati, Musa A; AlDosary, Oweida; Tlayjeh, Haytham; Gerberi, Dana; Murad, M Hassan; Sohail, M Rizwan; Kashour, Tarek; Tleyjeh, Imad M",J Antimicrob Chemother,,402

335959,Characterization of NT-proBNP in a large cohort of COVID-19 patients,2021,"Understanding a medical conversation between a patient and a physician poses a unique natural language understanding challenge since it combines elements of standard open ended conversation with very domain specific elements that require expertise and medical knowledge. Summarization of medical conversations is a particularly important aspect of medical conversation understanding since it addresses a very real need in medical practice: capturing the most important aspects of a medical encounter so that they can be used for medical decision making and subsequent follow ups. In this paper we present a novel approach to medical conversation summarization that leverages the unique and independent local structures created when gathering a patient's medical history. Our approach is a variation of the pointer generator network where we introduce a penalty on the generator distribution, and we explicitly model negations. The model also captures important properties of medical conversations such as medical knowledge coming from standardized medical ontologies better than when those concepts are introduced explicitly. Through evaluation by doctors, we show that our approach is preferred on twice the number of summaries to the baseline pointer generator model and captures most or all of the information in 80% of the conversations making it a realistic alternative to costly manual summarization by medical experts.","Joshi, Anirudh; Katariya, Namit; Amatriain, Xavier; Kannan, Anitha",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.08666v1.pdf,402
337193,Obesity and sleep apnea as a significant comorbidities in COVID-19 - A case report,2021,"OBJECTIVES: At the end of November 2019, a novel coronavirus responsible for respiratory tract infections (COVID-19) emerged in China. Despite drastic containment measures, this virus, known as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), spread in Asia and Europe. The pandemic is ongoing with a particular hotspot in Southern Europe and America; many studies predicted a similar epidemic in Africa, as is currently seen in Europe and the United States of America. However, reported data have not confirmed these predictions. One of the hypotheses that could explain the later emergence and spread of COVID-19 pandemic in African countries is the use of antimalarial drugs to treat malaria, and specifically, artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT). METHODS: The antiviral activity of fixed concentrations of ACT at concentrations consistent with those observed in human plasma when ACT is administered at oral doses for uncomplicated malaria treatment was evaluatedin vitro against a clinically isolated SARS-CoV-2 strain (IHUMI-3) in Vero E6 cells. RESULTS: Mefloquine-artesunate exerted the highest antiviral activity with % inhibition of 72.1 ± 18.3 % at expected maximum blood concentration (Cmax) for each ACT drug at doses commonly administered in malaria treatment. All the other combinations, artesunate-amodiaquine, artemether-lumefantrine, artesunate-pyronaridine, or dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine, showed antiviral inhibition in the same ranges (27.1 to 34.1 %). CONCLUSIONS: Antimalarial drugs for which concentration data in the lungs are available are concentrated from 10 to 160 fold more in the lungs than in blood. Thesein vitro results reinforce the hypothesis that antimalarial drugs could be effective as an anti-COVID-19 treatment.","Gendrot, Mathieu; Duflot, Isabelle; Boxberger, Manon; Delandre, Océane; Jardot, Priscilla; Le Bideau, Marion; Andreani, Julien; Fonta, Isabelle; Mosnier, Joel; Rolland, Clara; Hutter, Sébastien; La Scola, Bernard; Pradines, Bruno",Int J Infect Dis,,402

We isolated potent neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) to two epitopes on the receptor binding domain (RBD) and to distinct non-RBD epitopes on the spike (S) protein. As indicated by maintained weight and low lung viral titers in treated animals, the passive transfer of a nAb provides protection against disease in high-dose SARS-CoV-2 challenge in Syrian hamsters. The study suggests a role for nAbs in prophylaxis, and potentially therapy, of COVID-19.

Since March 2020, the COVID-19 Health System Response Monitor, a joint initiative of the European Observatory on Health Systems and Policies, the WHO Regional Office for Europe, and the European Commission, has documented country responses to COVID-19 using a structured template which includes a section on provision of care. Using the information available on the platform, this paper analyzes how countries planned services for potential surge capacity, designed patient flows ensuring separation between COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 patients, and maintained routine services in both hospital and ambulatory settings. Despite very real differences in the organization of health and care services, there were many similarities in country responses. These include transitioning the management of COVID-19 mild cases from hospitals to outpatient settings, increasing the use of remote consultations, and cancelling or postponing non-urgent services during the height of the first wave. In the immediate future, countries will have to continue balancing care for COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 patients to minimize adverse health outcomes, ideally with supporting guidelines and COVID-19-specific care zones. Looking forward, policymakers will have to consider whether strategies adopted during the COVID-19 pandemic will become permanent features of care provision.","Webb, Erin; Hernández-Quevedo, Cristina; Williams, Gemma; Scarpetti, Giada; Reed, Sarah; Panteli, Dimitra",Health policy,,402

However, in 2019–2020, with the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, the supply of commercial milk was disrupted, and the local smallholder dairy farmers played an important role in stabilizing nutritional security in rural, arid areas of China. The aim of this study was to describe and understand the operation of smallholder dairy farms and suggest what improvements are needed. We interviewed 45 smallholder dairy farmers from Gansu Province. A questionnaire was used to collect information on the dairy operation, including, number of cows, cow breeds, feed offered, yield and on management and open-ended discussions on the needs of the farmers to improve their dairies. Feed samples were collected at each farm to determine composition and milk samples were collected to analyze for composition and fatty acid content, and to compare the quality with commercial milk. Smallholder farmers generally fed dairy cows local, low-quality forages, mainly wheat straw and corn stover (CS/WS), and the milk yield was low, however, milk had a high content of beneficial unsaturated and polyunsaturated fatty acids. Milk from smallholder farms had lower concentrations of undesirable saturated fatty acids, higher concentrations of beneficial unsaturated and polyunsaturated fatty acids, and a lower atherogenic index than commercial milk. Proper sanitation measures and veterinary care were often lacking in these remote areas, leading to high somatic cell counts (SCC). A modified version of grounded theory was used to construct categories of what the farmers perceived was needed to improve their dairies. Four categories emerged in the following order: 1) equipment and management, 2) government support, 3) better cows, and 4) better feed. In a follow-up survey in 2020 of 18 farmers, conditions generally remained the same, including feed offered the animals, which would indicate that the milk composition remained the same. It was concluded that smallholder dairy farmers can provide nutritional security, especially for local residents in remote, rural, arid areas, but improvements in facilities, management, feed, cow breeds and sanitation are needed. Government subsidies should be implemented to help the smallholder dairy farmers. Results from this study provide information for local governments in their decision-making policies to stabilize smallholder dairies.","Li, Shanshan Bai Yanfu Jiao Jianxin Degen A.

The severity of the disease depends on the patient's overall medical condition but no appropriate markers are available to establish the prognosis of the patients. We performed a 16S rRNA gene sequencing, revealing an altered composition of the nasal/oropharyngeal (NOP) microbiota in 21 patients affected by COVID-19, paucisymptomatic or in an Intensive Care Unit (ICU), as compared to 10 controls negative for COVID-19 or eight affected by a different Human Coronavirus (HKU, NL63 and OC43). A significant decrease in Chao1 index was observed when patients affected by COVID-19 (in ICU) were compared to paucisymptomatic. Furthermore, patients who were in ICU, paucisymptomatic or affected by other Coronaviruses all displayed a decrease in the Chao1 index when compared to controls, while Shannon index significantly decreased only in patients under ICU as compared to controls and paucisymptomatic patients. At the phylum level, Deinococcus-Thermus was present only in controls as compared to SARS-CoV-2 patients admitted to ICU, paucisymptomatic or affected by other coronaviruses. Candidatus Saccharibacteria (formerly known as TM7) was strongly increased in negative controls and SARS-CoV-2 paucisymptomatic patients as compared to SARS-CoV-2 ICU patients. Other modifications were observed at a lower taxonomy level. Complete depletion of Bifidobacterium and Clostridium was exclusively observed in ICU SARS-CoV-2 patients, which was the only group characterized by the presence of Salmonella, Scardovia, Serratia and Pectobacteriaceae. In conclusion, our preliminary results showed that nasal/oropharyngeal microbiota profiles of patients affected with SARS-CoV-2 may provide valuable information in order to facilitate the stratification of patients and may open the way to new interventional strategies in order to ameliorate the outcome of the patients.","Rueca, Martina; Fontana, Andrea; Bartolini, Barbara; Piselli, Pierluca; Mazzarelli, Antonio; Copetti, Massimiliano; Binda, Elena; Perri, Francesco; Gruber, Cesare Ernesto Maria; Nicastri, Emanuele; Marchioni, Luisa; Ippolito, Giuseppe; Capobianchi, Maria Rosaria; Di Caro, Antonino; Pazienza, Valerio",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,402
339588,Meta-analysis: COVID-19 Disease Severity Correlates with Smoking Status,2020,"We present a hypothesis for increased sugar consumption and a lack of physical exercise as possible determinants of COVID-19 disease severity by impaired glucose metabolism, concurring into a syndemic. National data demonstrate that increased sugar consumption, a high daily caloric intake, and low levels of daily physical activity are independently associated with COVID-19 mortality. Further, genetic factors such as variations in the androgen receptor may compound the effects of an unhealthy lifestyle and increase the risk of severe COVID-19 symptoms in some patients. A diet high in sugar in combination with a low level of physical activity may increase blood glucose levels and impair glucose metabolism. Recent data show that patients admitted to the hospital with high levels of fasting blood glucose are at an increased risk for severe COVID-19 symptoms. Moreover, elevated glucose levels resulted in increased SARS-CoV-2 viral loads in vitro. We believe that healthier habits of diet and exercise, by improving glucose homeostasis could modulate the individual risk of severe COVID-19 symptoms.","Chesnut, Walter M; MacDonald, Scott; Wambier, Carlos Gustavo",Med Hypotheses,,402
340303,How often should ring pessaries be removed or changed in women with advanced POP? A prospective observational study,2021,"At the end of 2019, there was an outbreak of a new Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19 disease). Studies suggest that SARS-CoV-2 can cause infection in the central nervous system (CNS) and trigger neurological symptoms that include headache, nausea and vomiting, mental confusion and loss of smell or taste. These findings reveal that Coronaviruses have neurological tropism and neuroinvasive capacity. The spread of SARS-CoV-2 in the brain tissue possibly occurs through the systemic circulation as reported in patients affected by SARS-CoV. Evidence highlights similarity between the SARS-CoV genome and SARS-CoV-2 and that both interact with the angiotensin-converting enzyme type 2 (ACE2) located in the brain tissue of infected patients. Hence, the presence of ACE2 is likely in the CNS to mediate the entry of the SARS-CoV-2 virus into neural tissue. Our hypothesis suggests that SARS-CoV-2 can cause encephalitis through the production of inflammatory mediators and activation of immune system cells resulting from the interaction of the ACE2 receptor with the viral Spike protein that causes an increase in angiotensin II. This mechanism has the ability to activate immune system cells by exacerbating stimuli at the angiotensin 2 receptor (AT2R). Thus, it leads to a status of brain injury preceded by vascular damage and destruction of the blood-brain barrier, making it responsible for the installation of acute inflammation.","de Sousa, Antônio Kleiton; Magalhães, Diva de Aguiar; Ferreira, Jayro dos Santos; Barbosa, André Luiz dos Reis",Med.

It spread rapidly all over the world and claimed the lives of over 300,000 people. There is no known effective vaccine and treatment yet. It is impossible to develop vaccines and specific treatment without understanding the pathogenesis of the disease. Experience from severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) outbreaks may help to elucidate the pathogenesis of COVID-19. Nevertheless, many issues remained obscure regarding the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2. Exaggerated immune response leads to respiratory failure and even complications which may culminate in death. Cytokines storm, the complement system, endothelial damage, coagulation cascade, cellular and humoral immunity all play an important role in immune pathogenesis and inflammation. In this review, the relationship between the immune response/host characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 and the severity of the disease, antibody responses, and immune pathogenesis, possible causes of hypercoagulation will be discussed and it's aimed to provide perspective on the development of effective vaccines and specific treatment.","Mavi, Deniz; Inkaya, Ahmet Çağkan",Flora,,402

During the first lockdown in France, we developed an onco-palliative ethics meeting to enhance the quality of the decision-making process for patients with advanced cancer treated for COVID-19. METHODS: A least one of the institutional ethics committee members was present along with oncologists, palliative care teams, psycho-oncologists, radiologists and intensive care specialists. Specific medical parameters were systematically collected to form a standardised framework for the discussions. RESULTS: The main raised issues were the definition of new criteria for the implementation of invasive resuscitation techniques, optimal ways to adapt or delay anticancer treatment and best procedures to address terminal respiratory failure and end-of-life care. The main clinical and ethical guidelines that emerged during these debates are presented. The palliative care team played a major role in assessing and reporting patients' awareness of cancer-related prognosis and their wishes concerning invasive therapies or transfer to intensive care units, enabling an individualised benefit-risk balance assessment. The ethics committee members ensured continuous monitoring during the discussions. Their function was to recall the main ethical principles including dignity, which is conferred on people when there are treated as having equal status. CONCLUSIONS: The onco-palliative ethics meeting provided a powerful avenue for improvement of collegiality and reinforcement of teamwork, which could be a major protection against burnout for healthcare professionals facing an epidemic onslaught.","Thery, L.; Vaflard, P.; Vuagnat, P.; Soulie, O.; Dolbeault, S.; Burnod, A.; Laouisset, C.; Marchal, T.; Massiani, M.

341626,Clinical Characteristics and Prognosis of 218 Patients With COVID-19: A Retrospective Study Based on Clinical Classification,2020,"INTRODUCTION: Current recommendations for diagnostic imaging for moderately to severely ill patients with suspected coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) include chest radiograph (CXR). Our primary objective was to determine whether lung ultrasound (LUS) B-lines, when excluding patients with alternative etiologies for B-lines, are more sensitive for the associated diagnosis of COVID-19 than CXR. METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort study of all patients who presented to a single, academic emergency department in the United States between March 20 and April 6, 2020, and received LUS, CXR, and viral testing for COVID-19 as part of their diagnostic evaluation. The primary objective was to estimate the test characteristics of both LUS B-lines and CXR for the associated diagnosis of COVID-19. Our secondary objective was to evaluate the proportion of patients with COVID-19 that have secondary LUS findings of pleural abnormalities and subpleural consolidations. RESULTS: We identified 43 patients who underwent both LUS and CXR and were tested for COVID-19. Of these, 27/43 (63%) tested positive. LUS was more sensitive (88.9%, 95% confidence interval (CI), 71.1-97.0) for the associated diagnosis of COVID-19 than CXR (51.9%, 95% CI, 34.0-69.3; p = 0.013). LUS and CXR specificity were 56.3% (95% CI, 33.2-76.9) and 75.0% (95% CI, 50.0-90.3), respectively (p = 0.453). Secondary LUS findings of patients with COVID-19 demonstrated 21/27 (77.8%) had pleural abnormalities and 10/27 (37%) had subpleural consolidations. CONCLUSION: Among patients who underwent LUS and CXR, LUS was found to have a higher sensitivity than CXR for the evaluation of COVID-19. This data could have important implications as an aid in the diagnostic evaluation of COVID-19, particularly where viral testing is not available or restricted. If generalizable, future directions would include defining how to incorporate LUS into clinical management and its role in screening lower-risk populations.","Pare, Joseph R; Camelo, Ingrid; Mayo, Kelly C; Leo, Megan M; Dugas, Julianne N; Nelson, Kerrie P; Baker, William E; Shareef, Faizah; Mitchell, Patricia M; Schechter-Perkins, Elissa M",West J Emerg Med,,402

Drug repurposing screening is regarded as one of the most practical and rapid approaches for the discovery of such therapeutics. The 3C like protease (3CL pro ), or main protease (M pro ) of SARS-CoV-2 is a valid drug target as it is a specific viral enzyme and plays an essential role in viral replication. We performed a quantitative high throughput screening (qHTS) of 10,755 compounds consisting of approved and investigational drugs, and bioactive compounds using a SARS-CoV-2 3CL pro assay. Twenty-three small molecule inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 3CL pro have been identified with IC50s ranging from 0.26 to 28.85 µM. Walrycin B (IC 50 = 0.26 µM), Hydroxocobalamin (IC 50 = 3.29 µM), Suramin sodium (IC 50 = 6.5 µM), Z-DEVD-FMK (IC 50 = 6.81 µM), LLL-12 (IC 50 = 9.84 µM), and Z-FA-FMK (IC 50 = 11.39 µM) are the most potent 3CL pro inhibitors. The activities of anti-SARS-CoV-2 viral infection was confirmed in 7 of 23 compounds using a SARS-CoV-2 cytopathic effect assay. The results demonstrated a set of SARS-CoV-2 3CL pro inhibitors that may have potential for further clinical evaluation as part of drug combination therapies to treating COVID-19 patients, and as starting points for chemistry optimization for new drug development.","Zhu, Wei; Xu, Miao; Chen, Catherine Z; Guo, Hui; Shen, Min; Hu, Xin; Shinn, Paul; Klumpp-Thomas, Carleen; Michael, Samuel G; Zheng, Wei",,,402

Specifically, we assess the implied stock market's volatility indices' predictive power on synchronizing global equity indices returns. We built the correlation network of 26 stock indices and implemented in-sample and out-of-sample tests to evaluate the predictive power of VIX, VSTOXX, and VXJ implied volatility indices. To measure markets' synchronization, we use the Minimum Spanning Tree length and the length of the Planar Maximally Filtered Graph. Our results indicate a high predictive power of all the volatility indices, both individually and together, though the VIX predominates over the evaluated options. We find that an increase in the markets' volatility expectations, captured by the implied volatility indices, is a good Granger predictor of an increase in the synchronization of returns in the following month. Estimating, monitoring, and predicting returns' synchronization is essential for investment decision-making, especially for diversification strategies and regulating financial systems.","Magner, Nicolás; Lavin, Jaime F; Valle, Mauricio; Hardy, Nicolás",PLoS One,,402

346034,Tocilizumab in Patients Hospitalized with Covid-19 Pneumonia,2021,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has affected many countries with increasing morbidity and mortality. Interestingly, many of the actions and policies adopted in countries are linked to the social determinants of health (SDH). The SDH are critical determinants of health and health inequalities that are not directly within the health sector. Policies such as social distancing, good hygiene, avoiding large gatherings, cancelling of social and sports events, using personal protective equipment, schools and restaurants closure, country lockdown, etc. are not necessarily within the health sector but have been promoted to prevent and attenuate COVID-19 infection rates significantly. The SDH that serve to reduce morbidity will forestall or substantially reduce the pressure on many weak health systems in developing countries that cannot cope with increased hospitalisation and intensive health care. This paper argues that one of the most critical social determinants of health (i.e. effective crisis and risk communication), is crucial in many developing countries, including those with fewer confirmed coronavirus cases. We note that the effectiveness of many of the other SDH in reducing the burden of the COVID-19 pandemic hinges on effective communication, especially crisis and risk communication. Although many countries are adopting different communication strategies during the COVID-19 crisis, effective crisis and risk communication will lead to building trust, credibility, honesty, transparency, and accountability. The peculiarity of many developing countries in terms of regional, cultural, linguistic and ethnic diversity is an essential consideration in ensuring effective crisis and risk communication. Developing countries facing significant poverty and disease burden cannot afford to handle the burgeoning of COVID-19 infections and must take preventive measures seriously. Thus, we submit that there is a need to intensify SDH actions and ensure that no one is left behind when communicating crisis and risk to the population to address the COVID-19 pandemic.","Ataguba, Ochega A; Ataguba, John E",Glob Health Action,,402

Patients with diabetes are more vulnerable to the disease, and the mortality is higher than in those without diabetes. We reported a severe COVID-19 patient with diabetes and shared our experience with blood glucose management. PATIENT CONCERNS: A 64-year-old female diabetes patient was admitted to the intensive care unit due to productive coughing for 8 days without any obvious cause. The results of blood gas analysis indicated that the partial pressure of oxygen was 84 mm Hg with oxygen 8âL/min, and the oxygenation index was less than 200 mm Hg. In addition, postprandial blood glucose levels were abnormal (29.9âmmol/L). DIAGNOSES: The patient was diagnosed with COVID-19 (severe type) and type 2 diabetes. INTERVENTIONS: Comprehensive interventions including establishing a multidisciplinary team, closely monitoring her blood glucose level, an individualized diabetes diet, early activities, psychological care, etc, were performed to control blood glucose while actively treating COVID-19 infection. OUTCOMES: After the comprehensive measures, the patient's blood glucose level gradually became stable, and the patient was discharged after 20 days of hospitalization. LESSONS: This case indicated that the comprehensive measures performed by a multidisciplinary team achieved good treatment effects on a COVID-19 patient with diabetes. Targeted treatment and nursing methods should be performed based on patients' actual situations in clinical practice.","Hu, Rujun; Gao, Huiming; Huang, Di; Jiang, Deyu; Chen, Fang; Fu, Bao; Yuan, Xiaoli; Li, Jin; Jiang, Zhixia",Medicine (Baltimore),,402

In up to 20% of cases, COVID-19 infection can take a severe, life-threatening course. Therefore, preventive measures such as mask-wearing, hand hygiene, and social distancing are important. COVID-19 vaccines that use novel vaccine technology can prevent up to 95% of infections. However, the uncertainty regarding the efficacy and safety of vaccination in patients with autoimmune inflammatory rheumatic disease (AIIRD), who are immunocompromised due to underlying immune dysfunction and concomitant immunosuppressive treatment, warrants clear guidance. A task force of the Korean College of Rheumatology formulated a set of vaccination guidance based on the currently available data and expert consensus. The currently available COVID-19 vaccines are considered to be safe and effective. Every patient with AIIRD should receive one of the available COVID-19 vaccines unless contraindicated for medical reasons such as prior allergy/anaphylaxis to the COVID-19 vaccine or its components. Patients should continue immunosuppressive treatment for their underlying AIIRD, including biological and targeted synthetic disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (b/tsDMARDs). Corticosteroids should be reduced to the lowest dose possible without aggravating the AIIRD. To improve the vaccine response, methotrexate can be withheld for 1-2 weeks after each vaccination, and the timing of rituximab and abatacept infusion should be adjusted if clinically acceptable. Rheumatologists should play a leading role in educating and vaccinating patients with AIIRD.","Park, Jin Kyun; Lee, Eun Bong; Shin, Kichul; Sung, Yoon Kyoung; Kim, Tae Hwan; Kwon, Seong Ryul; Lee, Myeung Su; Hong, Seung Jae; Choi, Byoong Yong; Lee, Shin Seok; Back, Han Joo",J Korean Med Sci,,402
347090,Clinical Characteristics and Neonatal Outcomes of Pregnant Patients With COVID-19: A Systematic Review,2020,"People’s choices of (electronic) communication channels are central to the quality of communication—and sometimes detrimental to their actual communication goals. However, while factors influencing media choice are abundant, potential means to intentionally influence these choices are scarce within computer-mediated communication research. We explore the role of regulatory focus as one possible factor to understand and influence media choice in interpersonal conflicts. Regulatory focus theory proposes two motivational systems, promotion (i.e., needs for nurturance and growth) and prevention (i.e., needs for safety and security), that account for differences in preferred strategies for goal-pursuit. In a vignette-based study, we manipulated the situational regulatory focus (promotion or prevention) and surveyed participants’ preferred media choice for a hypothetical conflict scenario. Our results show that the induction of a dominant prevention focus (vs. promotion focus) leads to a shift in preference towards leaner communication media and channels that establish a higher subjective buffer between sender and receiver (e.g., text-messaging over calling). We elaborate on how these findings contribute to the understanding of media choice in interpersonal conflicts and point out potential ways to influence behavior through the design of communication technologies. Limitations of the present study and future research opportunities are discussed.","Diefenbach, Sarah",Psych,,402

Outcomes and ECI scores were constructed from retrospective data obtained from the Cerner COVID-19 De-Identified Data cohort. We hypothesized that racial disparities in COVID-19 outcomes would exist despite comparable ECI scores among non-Hispanic (NH) Blacks, Hispanics, American Indians/Alaska Natives (AI/ANs), and NH Whites. Compared with NH Whites, NH Blacks had longer hospital LOS, higher rates of ventilator dependence, and a higher mortality rate; AI/ANs, higher odds of hospitalization for ECI = 0 but lower for ECI &#8805; 5, longer LOS for ECI = 0, a higher risk of death across all ECI categories except ECI &#8805; 5, and higher odds of ventilator dependence; Hispanics, a lower risk of death across all ECI categories except ECI = 0, lower odds of hospitalization, shorter LOS for ECI &#8805; 5, and higher odds of ventilator dependence for ECI = 0 but lower for ECI = 1-4. Our findings contest arguments that higher comorbidity levels explain elevated COVID-19 death rates among NH Blacks and AI/ANs compared with Hispanics and NH Whites.","Qeadan, Fares; VanSant-Webb, Elizabeth; Tingey, Benjamin; Rogers, Tiana N; Brooks, Ellen; Mensah, Nana A; Winkfield, Karen M; Saeed, Ali I; English, Kevin; Rogers, Charles R",Sci Rep,,402
347468,The Challenge of Treating Kidney Transplant Recipients Infected with COVID-19: Report of the First Cases in Israel,2020,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by respiratory syndrome coronavirus qualified as SARS-CoV-2. Viral penetration requires binding of the viral spike (S) protein to a specific cellular receptor (ACE2) highly expressed in a nasal goblet and ciliated cells. In several countries, the COVID-19 evolution was relatively benign compared to others and despite noncompliance with health recommendations on several occasions. In this overview, we attempt to define the criteria that could explain such a difference. Among these criteria, the specificity of Lactobacillus genus strains, as a part of nasal microbiota, could play a role of a barrier against viral penetration and could strengthen the host's immune system in some populations rather than others. In fact, several studies have shown the role of lactic acid bacteria, including lactobacilli, in the prevention of viral respiratory infections. This could provide important information on a possible mechanism of the virus spreading.","Zrelli, Samia; Amairia, Safa; Zrelli, Malek",J. med. virol,,402

349070,Comparison of lung ultrasonography findings with chest computed tomography results in coronavirus (COVID-19) pneumonia,2021,"Macroeconomics has constantly been exposed to socio-economic shocks. The concept of resilience in the economy has been developed to predict these shocks, reduce damages, and recover quickly. This paper proposes a quantitative approach for analyzing macroeconomic resilience due to socio-economic shocks and suggests appropriate actions to improve resilience. In this way, the variables affecting macroeconomic resilience have been identified through the literature review. Next, an integrated indicator of macroeconomic performance based on Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) has been developed. Finally, the periods of shocks are identified by determining the turning points of that indicator, and an appropriate approach for defining macroeconomic resilience is developed. The proposed approach is applied to three countries of the USA, China, and Iran in different shocks, including global crisis, COVID-19 pandemic, and oil price shock. Eventually, by analyzing the relationships between effective variables on the macroeconomic resilience, using the DEMATEL method, we determine the most important variables to improve macroeconomic resilience, which can be useful for socio-economic planning at a macro level.","Soufi, Hojat Rezaei Esfahanipour Akbar Shirazi Mohsen Akbarpour",Socio-Economic Planning Sciences,,402

349625,Bio-mechanics of Ards in Covid-19: a Prospective Observational Study,2020,"BACKGROUND: In response to COVID-19 pandemic, the Government of Uganda adopted public health measures to contain its spread in the country. Some of the initial measures included refusal to repatriate citizens studying in China, mandatory institutional quarantine, and social distancing. Despite being a public health emergency, the measures adopted deserve critical appraisal using an ethics and human rights approach. The goal of this paper is to formulate an ethics and human rights criteria for evaluating public health measures and use it to reflect on the ethical propriety of those adopted by the government of Uganda to contain the spread of COVID-19. MAIN BODY: We begin by illustrating the value of ethics and human rights considerations for public health measures including during emergencies. We then summarize Uganda's social and economic circumstances and some of the measures adopted to contain the spread of COVID-19. After reviewing some of the ethics and human rights considerations for public health, we reflect upon the ethical propriety of some of Uganda's responses to COVID-19. We use content analysis to identify the measures adopted by the government of Uganda to contain the spread of COVID-19, the ethics and human rights considerations commonly recommended for public health responses and their importance. Our study found that some of the measures adopted violate ethics and human rights principles. We argue that even though some human rights can sometimes be legitimately derogated and limited to meet public health goals during public health emergencies, measures that infringe on human rights should satisfy certain ethics and human rights criteria. Some of these criteria include being effective, strictly necessary, proportionate to the magnitude of the threat, reasonable in the circumstances, equitable, and least restrictive. We reflect on Uganda's initial measures to combat the spread of COVID-19 and argue that many of them fell short of these criteria, and potentially limit their effectiveness. CONCLUSION: The ethical legitimacy of public health measures is valuable in itself and for enhancing effectiveness of the measures. Such legitimacy depends on the extent to which they conform to ethics and human rights principles recommended for public health measures.","Barugahare, John; Nakwagala, Fredrick Nelson; Sabakaki, Erisa Mwaka; Ochieng, Joseph; K Sewankambo, Nelson",BMC Med Ethics,,402

350455,Therapeutic anticoagulation in COVID-19 patients,2021,"Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) has been recognized as a potential entry receptor for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Binding of SARS-CoV-2 to ACE2 allows engagement with pulmonary epithelial cells and pulmonary infection with the virus. ACE2 is an essential component of renin-angiotensin system (RAS), and involved in promoting protective effects to counter-regulate angiotensin (Ang) II-induced pathogenesis. The use of angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) and ACE inhibitors (ACEIs) was implicitly negated during the early phase of COVID-19 pandemic, considering the role of these antihypertensive agents in enhancing ACE2 expression thereby promoting the susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2. However, no clinical data has supported this assumption, but indeed evidence demonstrates that ACEIs and ARBs, besides their cardioprotective effects in COVID-19 patients with cardiovascular diseases, might also be beneficial in acute lung injuries by preserving the ACE2 function and switching the balance from deleterious ACE/Ang II/AT1 receptor axis towards a protective ACE2/Ang (1-7)/Mas receptor axis.","Gul, Rukhsana; Kim, Uh-Hyun; Alfadda, Assim A",Eur J Pharmacol,,402

Concepts as equilibrium and stability show to be crucial to qualitatively determine the best alternatives to schedule drugs, according to effectivity in inhibiting the virus infection and replication rates. Important biological events such as rebounds of the infections (when antivirals are incorrectly interrupted) can also be explained by means of a dynamic study of the target-cell model. In this work, a full characterization of the dynamical behavior of the target-cell models under control actions is made and, based on this characterization, the optimal fixed-dose antiviral schedule that produces the smallest amount of dead cells (without viral load rebounds) is computed. Several simulation results - performed by considering real patient data - show the potential benefits of both, the model characterization and the control strategy.","Perez, Mara; Abuin, Pablo; Actis, Marcelo; Ferramosca, Antonio; Hernandez-Vargas, Esteban A.; Gonzalez, Alejandro H.",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.09528v1.pdf,402
352011,Burden and prevalence of risk factors for severe COVID-19 disease in the ageing European population - A SHARE-based analysis,2020,"In South Korea, the National Health Insurance Service (NHIS) began its coverage of dentures and dental implants for older people in 2012 and 2014, respectively. This study aimed to investigate the impact of these policies on dental care utilization among people aged 65 years or older according to their sociodemographic characteristics. Data were collected from the Korea Health Panel Survey (KHP; years 2012 and 2015). The statistical significance of the relationships between sociodemographic characteristics and the use of outpatient dental care, denture, and dental implant were analyzed. Results showed an increase of 5.7%, 1.4%, and 2.8% in the use of outpatient dental care, denture, and dental implant, respectively, over the course of three years. Including dentures increased its use by 2.5-3.7 times among people aged 70 years or older. Including dental implants alleviated the disparities among older adults based on age groups and duration of education, except those among uneducated people; however, it caused inequity according to household income. Some Korean older adults remain neglected from the benefits of the expanded NHIS. Therefore, older adults' access to dental care should be enhanced by the implementation of policies to promote oral health care utilization, dental prosthetic services, and older adults' insurance coverage.","Choi, Jin-Sun; Jung, Se-Hwan",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,402

355077,Changes in the pattern of heart failure and diuresis clinic utilization during the COVID-19 pandemic,2020,"BACKGROUND: Syndromic surveillance through web or phone-based polling has been used to track the course of infectious diseases worldwide. Our study objective was to describe the characteristics, symptoms, and self-reported testing rates of respondents in three different COVID-19 symptom surveys in Canada. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study using three distinct Canada-wide web-based surveys, and phone polling in Ontario. All three sources contained self-reported information on COVID-19 symptoms and testing. In addition to describing respondent characteristics, we examined symptom frequency and the testing rate among the symptomatic, as well as rates of symptoms and testing across respondent groups. RESULTS: We found that over March- April 2020, 1.6% of respondents experienced a symptom on the day of their survey, 15% of Ontario households had a symptom in the previous week, and 44% of Canada-wide respondents had a symptom in the previous month. Across the three surveys, SARS-CoV-2-testing was reported in 2-9% of symptomatic responses. Women, younger and middle-aged adults (versus older adults) and Indigenous/First nations/Inuit/Métis were more likely to report at least one symptom, and visible minorities were more likely to report the combination of fever with cough or shortness of breath. INTERPRETATION: The low rate of testing among those reporting symptoms suggests significant opportunity to expand testing among community-dwelling residents of Canada. Syndromic surveillance data can supplement public health reports and provide much-needed context to gauge the adequacy of SARS-CoV-2 testing rates.","Lapointe-Shaw, Lauren; Rader, Benjamin; Astley, Christina M; Hawkins, Jared B; Bhatia, Deepit; Schatten, William J; Lee, Todd C; Liu, Jessica J; Ivers, Noah M; Stall, Nathan M; Gournis, Effie; Tuite, Ashleigh R; Fisman, David N; Bogoch, Isaac I; Brownstein, John S",PLoS One,,402

Such integration creates a Schottky junction depth that is larger than the UV absorption depth to sufficiently separate the photoinduced electron/hole pairs, boosting the peak internal quantum efficiency over the unity and the external quantum efficiency over 99% under weak UV light without bias. The proposed Ti3 C2 Tx /GaN vdWH UV photodiode demonstrates pronounced photoelectric performances working in self-powered mode, including a large responsivity (284 mA W-1 ), a high specific detectivity (7.06 × 1013 Jones), and fast response speed (rise/decay time of 7.55 µs/1.67 ms). Furthermore, the remarkable photovoltaic behavior leads to an impressive power conversion efficiency of 7.33% under 355 nm UV light illumination. Additionally, this work presents an easy-processing spray-deposition route for the fabrication of large-area UV photodiode arrays that exhibit highly uniform cell-to-cell performance. The MXene/GaN photodiode arrays with high-efficiency and self-powered ability show high potential for many applications, such as energy-saving communication, imaging, and sensing networks.","Song, Weidong; Chen, Jiaxin; Li, Ziliang; Fang, Xiaosheng",Adv Mater,,402
357046,Clinical outcomes of non-diabetic COVID-19 patients with different blood glucose levels: a nationwide Turkish study (TurCoGlycemia),2021,"AIM: While there are rampant deaths reported worldwide due to novel corona virus (COVID-19) on one side, hypertension, diabetes and renal failure are emerging comorbidities with mortality risk due to respiratory failure on the other side. The link of these morbidities with renin angiotensin system (RAS) and angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) as the site of the multiplication of COVID-19 has widely been accepted. The objective of this research report was to delineate the clinical characteristics with COVID-19 infection with RAS and to consider its significance not just for the search of novel antiviral drugs, but for the management and prevention of death of patients with COVID-19. METHODS: It was a retrospective case series analysis of demographic and clinical data with associated comorbidities of 206 deaths reported in India up to 10th April 2020. The data were available from the official release from Ministry of Health and Family welfare, Government of India. This was followed by a literature search to correlate the available evidence for their possible relationship with RAS. RESULTS: The demographic data were consistent with those reported from other countries. The death (53.4%) was more common in patients with age above 60 years and men (69.3%) were more susceptible as compared to women (30.68%).We found that 50.5% of the deceased patients had pre-existing comorbidities. Diabetes and hypertension were the major comorbidities in 27.8% and 22.1% of the deceased cases respectively. Although respiratory and cardiac problems were prevalent at the time of death, the pre-existing pulmonary disease was comparatively less prevalent. Only 13.6% of the deceased were having pre-existing respiratory problems and 6.2% had cardiac ailments. We could correlate the reports that RAS plays a significant role in the prognosis of the disease. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with cardiovascular diseases, diabetes mellitus and hypertension are at greater risk for developing COVID-19 infection. There may be massive derangement of the entire RAS after the attack of COVID-19 and hence, patients with these pre-existing comorbidities and on ACE inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers should be monitored carefully considering the role of RAS in the prognosis of COVID-19 infections.","Majeed, Jaseela; Ajmera, Puneeta; Goyal, Ramesh K",Diabetes Res Clin Pract,,402

Design/methodology/approach: An analysis of the current condition of the Polish prison system was undertaken focusing on items that were the focus of prisoners’ complaints, the interventions of the Ombudsman and the bulletins of the Central Board of the Prison Service This analysis has been juxtaposed with the opinions of experts in epidemiology and medicine and changes introduced in the law relating to prisoners Findings: During the COVID-19 epidemic – despite serious chronic problems in the Polish penitentiary system – the statistics indicated that 24 individuals were infected and no deaths occurred When compared to the statistics of non-prison cases, this result is extremely low Research limitations/implications: Given the newness of the problem, the conflicts of different interests, the “double” isolation of prisons (penal and epidemiological) and the reluctance of the prison administration to provide information about what is happening behind prison walls, researchers must rely on statistics and subjective contacts with prisoners, for example, by investigating their complaints Practical implications: As a result of the research, the author believes that the transparency of institutions such as prisons should be ensured, primarily expressed in the provision of information to both prisoners and the public relating to methods adopted to prevent epidemics in the context of prison and prisoners Originality/value: The value of this paper is to show how prisons have managed in a new, exceptional situation to balance the right to health and personal safety of prisoners and warders, with the right to contact with the outside world and humane living conditions in a closed and doubly isolated space The findings presented will add value to the knowledge and effectiveness of the prison administration’s reaction and response to an emergency such as an epidemic © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited","Niełaczna, M.",International Journal of Prisoner Health,,402

360223,Development of Simple and Sensitive Score to Assess the Risk of Pneumonia in COVID-19 Patients,2020,"AIM: To examine psychosocial and behavioural impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown restrictions among adults with type 2 diabetes. METHODS: Participants enrolled in the Progression of Diabetic Complications (PREDICT) cohort study in Melbourne, Australia (n=489 with a baseline assessment pre-2020) were invited to complete a phone/online follow-up assessment in mid-2020 (i.e. amidst COVID-19 lockdown restrictions). Repeated assessments that were compared with pre-COVID-19 baseline levels included anxiety symptoms (GAD-7), depressive symptoms (PHQ-8), diabetes distress (PAID), physical activity/sedentary behaviour, alcohol consumption, and diabetes self-management behaviours. Additional once-off measures at follow-up included COVID-19-specific worry, quality of life (QoL), and healthcare appointment changes (telehealth engagement and appointment cancellations/avoidance). RESULTS: Among 470 respondents (96%; aged 66±9 years, 69% men), at least 'moderate' worry about COVID-19 infection was reported by 31%, and 29-73% reported negative impacts on QoL dimensions (greatest for: leisure activities, feelings about the future, emotional wellbeing). Younger participants reported more negative impacts (P<0.05). Overall, anxiety/depressive symptoms were similar at follow-up compared with pre-COVID-19, but diabetes distress reduced (P<0.001). Worse trajectories of anxiety/depressive symptoms were observed among those who reported COVID-19-specific worry, or negative QoL impacts (P<0.05). Physical activity trended lower (~10%), but sitting time, alcohol consumption and glucose-monitoring frequency remained unchanged. 73% of participants used telehealth, but 43% cancelled a healthcare appointment and 39% avoided new appointments despite perceived need. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 lockdown restrictions negatively impacted QoL, some behavioural risk factors, and healthcare utilisation in adults with type 2 diabetes. However, generalised anxiety and depressive symptoms remained relatively stable.","Sacre, Julian W; Holmes-Truscott, Elizabeth; Salim, Agus; Anstey, Kaarin J; Drummond, Grant R; Huxley, Rachel R; Magliano, Dianna J; van Wijngaarden, Peter; Zimmet, Paul Z; Speight, Jane; Shaw, Jonathan E",Diabet Med,,402
360408,Risk factors on admission associated with hospital length of stay in patients with COVID-19: a retrospective cohort study,2021,"The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2) and its clinical manifestation, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID19) have rapidly spread across the globe, leading to the declaration of a pandemic. While most present mild symptoms, it appears as though nearly 20% of confirmed patients develop significant complications. These include acute respiratory distress syndrome, septic shock and multi-organ failure, with a 3-6% mortality. A plethora of treatments has been or is being assessed, but to date, none has been proven effective. Management is mainly symptomatic, with organ support for the critically ill. Several reports, mainly case series, from across the world have concluded that patients with malignancy appear more susceptible to severe infection and mortality from COVID-19. This could be attributed to immunosuppression, co-existing medical conditions and underlying pulmonary compromise which is often the case in lung malignancy. Patients with haematological cancer and those who are receiving active chemotherapy treatment may be at greatest risk due to increased immunosuppression. This pandemic tested the resilience of worldwide health-care systems in an unprecedented manner. It has forced oncologists to rethink the entire diagnostic and therapeutic process, based on the local prevalence and impact of COVID-19. In this review we will discuss the impact of COVID-19 on patients affected by cancer, their diagnosis and management, as well as the pathophysiology of COVID-19 induced acute respiratory distress symptoms and currently investigated treatment approaches.","Addeo, A; Friedlaender, A",Cancer Treat Rev,,402
360410,Risk factors on admission associated with hospital length of stay in patients with COVID-19: a retrospective cohort study,2021,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Communication plays an important role in advancing public health goals as well as in greater appreciation of underlying science and public policies. It is critical at all times, be it promoting health benefits of immunisation, importance of hand hygiene or taking personal measures for prevention of non-communicable diseases. Communication assumes even greater importance in the time of emergencies like the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic. A primary vehicle for health communication is mass media like television channels, newspapers and radio channels. METHODS: An analysis of current trends shows that the messages emerging from mass media are getting further amplified and dispersed through digital outlets and social media platforms which have become immensely popular. This has also given rise to a new phenomenon called infodemic or over-abundance of information - both genuine and fake. RESULTS: The article examines role of mass media in health communication in times of pandemic and the context of infodemic. CONCLUSIONS: The analysis points to the need for improvement in health journalism to improve its quality, credibility as well as relevance in a country like India where mass media consumption is high and health literacy is low.","Sharma, D C; Pathak, Abhishek; Chaurasia, Rameshwar Nath; Joshi, Deepika; Singh, Rajesh Kumar; Mishra, Vijay Nath",Diabetes Metab Syndr,,402
361382,COVIDiag: a clinical CAD system to diagnose COVID-19 pneumonia based on CT findings,2020,"The outbreak of 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has posed a grave threat to the global public health. The COVID-19-induced infection is closely related to coagulation dysfunction in the affected patients. This paper attempts to conduct a meta-analysis and systematically review the blood coagulation indicators in patients with severe COVID-19. A meta-analysis of eligible studies was performed to compare the blood coagulation indicators in patients with severe and nonsevere COVID-19. PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library were searched for studies published between 1 December 2019 and 7 May 2020. A total of 13 studies with 1341 adult patients were enrolled in this analysis. Platelet (weighted mean difference [WMD] = -24.83, 95% confidence interval [CI]: -34.12 to -15.54; P < .001), d-dimer (WMD = 0.19, 95% CI: 0.09-0.29; P < .001), and fibrinogen (WMD = 1.02, 95% CI: 0.50-1.54; P < .001) were significantly associated with the severity in patients with COVID-19. The meta-analysis revealed that no correlation was evident between an increased severity risk of COVID-19 and activated partial thromboplastin time (WMD = -1.56, 95% CI: -5.77 to 2.64; P = .468) or prothrombin time (WMD = 0.19, 95% CI: -0.13 to 0.51; P = .243). The single arm meta-analysis showed that compared with the nonsevere group, the severe group had a lower pooled platelet (165.12 [95% CI: 157.38-172.85] vs 190.09 [95% CI: 179.45-200.74]), higher d-dimer (0.49 [95% CI: 0.33-0.64] vs 0.27 [95% CI: 0.20-0.34]), and higher fibrinogen (4.34 [95% CI: 1.98-6.70] vs 3.19 [95% CI: 1.13-5.24]). Coagulation dysfunction is closely related to the severity of patients with COVID-19, in which low platelet, high d-dimer, and fibrinogen upon admission may serve as risk indicators for increased aggression of the disease. These findings are of great clinical value for timely and effective treatment of the COVID-19 cases.","Lin, Jing; Yan, Han; Chen, Hanchuan; He, Chen; Lin, Chunjin; He, Haoming; Zhang, Sicheng; Shi, Songjing; Lin, Kaiyang",J Med Virol,,402
361771,Clearance of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine by the Seraph® 100 Microbind® Affinity blood filter - approved for the treatment of COVID-19 patients,2020,"Biological polyesters of hydroxyacids are known as polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHA). They have proved to be an alternative, environmentally friendly and attractive candidate for the replacement of petroleum-based plastics in many applications. Many bacteria synthesize these compounds as an intracellular carbon and energy compound usually under unbalanced growth conditions. Biodegradability and biocompatibility of different PHA has been studied in cell culture systems or in an animal host during the last few decades. Such investigations have proposed that PHA can be used as biomaterials for applications in conventional medical devices such as sutures, patches, meshes, implants, and tissue engineering scaffolds as well. Moreover, findings related to encapsulation capability and degradation kinetics of some PHA polymers has paved their way for development of controlled drug delivery systems. The present review discusses about bio-plastics, their characteristics, examines the key findings and recent advances highlighting the usage of bio-plastics in different medical devices. The patents concerning to PHA application in biomedical field have been also enlisted that will provide a brief overview of the status of research in bio-plastic. This would help medical researchers and practitioners to replace the synthetic plastics aids that are currently being used. Simultaneously, it could also prove to be a strong step in reducing the plastic pollution that surged abruptly due to the COVID-19 medical waste.","Ansari, Sabbir; Sami, Neha; Yasin, Durdana; Ahmad, Nazia; Fatma, Tasneem",Int J Biol Macromol,,402

We hypothesized that a collaborative robot system could perform health care worker (HCW) effector tasks inside a simulated intensive care unit (ICU) patient room, which could theoretically reduce both PPE use and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) exposures. We planned a prospective proof-of-concept feasibility and design pilot study to test 5 discrete medical tasks in a simulated ICU room of a COVID-19 patient using a collaborative robot: push a button on intravenous pole machine when alert occurs for downstream occlusion, adjust ventilator knob, push button on ICU monitor to silence false alerts, increase oxygen flow on wall-mounted flow meter to allow the patient to walk to the bathroom and back (dial-up and dial-down oxygen flow), and push wall-mounted nurse call button. Feasibility was defined as task completion robotically. A training period of 45 minutes to 1 hour was needed to program the system de novo for each task. In less than 30 days, the team completed 5 simple effector task experiments robotically. Selected collaborative robotic effector tasks appear feasible in a simulated ICU room of the COVID-19 patient. Theoretically, this robotic approach could reduce PPE use and staff SARS-CoV-2 exposure. It requires future validation and HCW learning similar to other ICU device training.","Freeman, W David; Sanghavi, Devang K; Sarab, Masood S; Kindred, Mary S; Dieck, Elizabeth M; Brown, Suzanne M; Szambelan, Tom; Doty, Justin; Ball, Brendan; Felix, Heidi M; Dove, Jesse C; Mallea, Jorge M; Soares, Christy; Simon, Leslie V",,,402

METHODS: Fifty two male Wistar rats were randomly allocated in the following groups:G1-CTAN- control anesthesia whithout surgery. G2-CTCIR - control surgery without ischemia. G3-IRCT and G3-IRDTPA: four hours ischemia and two hours reperfusion. The animals of group 3 were treated with saline and those of the group 4, treated with CaNa3DTPA. Parameters were: foot circumference, rats weight, plasmatic creatine-phosphokinase (CPK), muscular malondialdehyde (MDA), and optic microscopy of muscle cells. RESULTS: There was a significant post-ischemic increase in foot circumference in G3-IRCT. CPK measurements were significantly increased in G3-IRCT and G3-IRDTPA, when compared to G1-CTAN and G2-CTCIR, but there were no differences between G3-IRCT and G3-IRDTPA. MDA was increased in the left no-ischemic muscles in G3-IRCT, when compared to contralateral muscles of G3-IRCT and of G1-CTAN.The histological evaluation showed inflammatory cell infiltrate in G3-IRDTPA and edema in G3-IRCT. The glycogen recovery was similar in both groups. CONCLUSION: There was less edema in the animals with ischemia-reperfusion treated group, but CaNa3DTPA don't protect muscle cells from injury in relations with CPK, MDA managements and histological alterations.","Francischetti, Ieda; Humberto de Abreu Maffei, Francisco; Bitu-Moreno, Jose; Fuhrmann Neto, Mário; Paula Villela Coelho, Maria; Hsu Tsu Kai, Fábio; Lopes Sequeira, Julio; Bonetti Yoshida, Winston",Acta cir. bras.,,402

Network-based approaches are divided into two categories: network-based clustering approaches and network-based propagation approaches. Both of them allowed to annotate some important patterns, to identify proteins that are functionally associated with COVID-19 and to discover novel drug-disease or drug-target relationships useful for new therapies. Structure-based approaches allowed to identify small chemical compounds able to bind macromolecular targets to evaluate how a chemical compound can interact with the biological counterpart, trying to find new applications for existing drugs.

Glucose uptake is correlated with an increased anaerobic glycolysis seen in activated inflammatory cells such as monocytes, lymphocytes, and granulocytes. The aim of the study was to assess the inflammatory status at the presumed peak of the inflammatory phase in non-critically ill patients requiring admission for COVID-19. METHODS: Patients admitted with COVID-19 were prospectively enrolled. FDG PET/CT was performed from day 6 to day 14 of the onset of symptoms. Depending on FDG PET/CT findings, patients' profiles were classified as ""inflammatory"" or ""low inflammatory."" FDG PET/CT data were compared with chest CT evolution and short-term clinical outcome. All inflammatory sites were reported to screen potential extra-pulmonary tropism. RESULTS: Thirteen patients were included. Maximum standardized uptake values ranged from 4.7 to 16.3 in lungs. All patients demonstrated increased mediastinal lymph nodes glucose uptake. Three patients (23%) presented mild nasopharyngeal, two patients (15%) bone marrow, and five patients (38%) splenic mild increase in glucose uptake. No patient had significant digestive focal or segmental glucose uptake. There was no significant physiological myocardial glucose uptake in all patients except one. There was no correlation between PET lung inflammatory status and chest CT evolution or short-term clinical outcome. CONCLUSION: Inflammatory process at the presumed peak of the inflammatory phase in COVID-19 patients is obvious in FDG PET/CT scans. Glucose uptake is heterogeneous and typically focused on lungs.

FFP3 masks are used in AGP areas. Concerns from the ENT and plastic surgery communities out with intensive care units have questioned this policy. Emerging evidence on cough clouds and health care worker deaths has suggested that a review is required. AIMS: To test the efficacy of Fluid Resistant Surgical Mask with and without adaptions for respiratory protection. To test the efficacy of FFP and FFP3 regarding fit testing and usage. METHODS: A smoke chamber test of 5 min to model an 8-h working shift of exposure while wearing UK guideline PPE using an inspiratory breathing mouthpiece under the mask. Photographic data were used for comparison. RESULTS: The Fluid Resistant Surgical Mask gave no protection to inhaled smoke particles. Modifications with tape and three mask layers gave slight benefit but were not considered practical. FFP3 gave complete protection to inhaled smoke but strap tension needs to be 'just right' to prevent facial trauma. Facial barrier creams are an infection risk. CONCLUSIONS: Surgical masks give no protection to respirable particles. Emerging evidence on cough clouds and health care worker deaths suggests the implementation of a precautionary policy of FFP3 for all locations exposed to symptomatic or diagnosed COVID-19 patients.

Although COVID-19 affects all racial ethnicities, non-Hispanic Blacks have the highest mortality rates. Evidence continues to emerge, linking the disproportion of contagion and mortality from severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), a result of adverse social determinants of health. Yet, genetic predisposition may also play a credible role in disease transmission. SARS-CoV-2 enters cells by interaction between SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and the receptor molecule angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) expressed on the surface of the target cells, such that polymorphisms and the expression level of ACE2 influence infectivity and consequent pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2. Genetic polymorphisms in other multiple genes, such as acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and interleukin-6, are also closely associated with underlying diseases, such as hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus, which substantially raise SARS-CoV-2 mortality. However, it is unknown how these genetic polymorphisms contribute to the disparate mortality rates, with or without underlying diseases. Of particular interest is the potential that genetic polymorphisms in these genes may be influencing the disparity of COVID-19 mortality rates in Black communities. Here, we review the evidence that biological predisposition for high-risk comorbid conditions may be relevant to our ability to fully understand and therefore address health disparities of COVID-19 deaths in Blacks.","Phillips, Nicole; Park, In-Woo; Robinson, Janie R; Jones, Harlan P",J. racial ethnic health disparities (Internet),,402
367737,"Serum uric acid, disease severity and outcomes in COVID-19",2021,"The data of COVID-19 disease in China and then in South Korea were collected daily from several different official websites. The collected data included 33 death cases in Wuhan city of Hubei province during early outbreak as well as confirmed cases and death toll in some specific regions, which were chosen as representatives from the perspective of the coronavirus outbreak in China. Data were copied and pasted onto Excel spreadsheets to perform data analysis. A new methodology, Patient Information Based Algorithm (PIBA) [1], has been adapted to process the data and used to estimate the death rate of COVID-19 in real-time. Assumption is that the number of days from inpatients to death fall into a pattern of normal distribution and the scores in normal distribution can be obtained by observing 33 death cases and analysing the data [2]. We selected 5 scores in normal distribution of these durations as lagging days, which will be used in the following estimation of death rate. We calculated each death rate on accumulative confirmed cases with each lagging day from the current data and then weighted every death rate with its corresponding possibility to obtain the total death rate on each day. While the trendline of these death rate curves meet the curve of current ratio between accumulative death cases and confirmed cases at some points in the near future, we considered that these intersections are within the range of real death rates. Six tables were presented to illustrate the PIBA method using data from China and South Korea.

In addition to routine psychological tests, the participants were asked the following two questions: ""Do you know COVID-19?"" and ""Why are you wearing a face mask?"". Moderate to severe AD patients were found to have a low COVID-19 recognition rate and did not fully understand why they were wearing face masks. In addition, because they did not understand the seriousness of the COVID-19 outbreak, their Geriatric Depression Scale scores were also substantially lower.

OBJECTIVE: To conduct a scoping review on the available evidence on tolerable nasal disinfectants with encouraging health outcomes against SARS-CoV-2, i.e., agents effective against at least two different viruses beyond SARS-CoV-2. METHODS: Online databases were searched to identify papers published during 2010-2020. Publications were selected if they were relevant to the scoping review. The review was narrative, describing for each treatment the mechanism(s) of action, tolerability, in vitro and in vivo evidence of the effects against SARS-CoV-2 and whether the product had been marketed. RESULTS: Eight treatments were scrutinized: hypothiocyanite, lactoferrin, N-chlorotaurine, interferon-alpha, povidone-iodine, quaternary ammonium compounds, alcohol-based nasal antiseptics and hydroxychloroquine. In vitro viricidal effect against SARS-CoV-2 was reported for ethanol, alcohol-based hand sanitizers and povidone-iodine. Inhibition of other coronaviruses was described for lactoferrin, ethanol, hydroxychloroquine and quaternary ammonium compound. No treatment has been tested against SARS-CoV-2 in randomized controlled clinical trials thus far. However, interferon-alpha, lactoferrin and hydroxychloroquine were tested in one-arm open label uncontrolled clinical trial. Oxidant activity (hypothiocyanite, N-chlorotaurine and povidone-iodine), enhancement of endocytic and lysosomal pH (quaternary ammonium compounds and hydroxychloroquine) and destruction of the viral capsid (quaternary ammonium compounds, alcohol-based nasal antiseptics) were the main mechanisms of action. Lactoferrin and interferon-alpha have subtle biological mechanisms. With the exception of N-chlorotaurine, all other products available on the market. CONCLUSIONS: Effective and safe chemo-prophylactic drugs against SARS-CoV-2 do not exist yet but most eligible candidates are already in the market. Whilst the human nasal cavity is the port of entry for SARS-CoV-2, the mouth is involved as exit site through emission of respiratory droplets. The well-known hand-to-nose-to-hand cycle of contamination requires appropriate additional strategies for infection control. To narrow down the subsequent laboratory and clinical investigations, a case-control approach could be employed to compare the use of candidate drugs among individuals testing positive and negative to COVID-19 swabs.","Cegolon, L; Javanbakht, M; Mastrangelo, G",Int J Hyg Environ Health,,402
367864,Clinical characteristics of adult patients hospitalized with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia,2020,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) virus has spread all over the world. Scientists are trying to discover drugs as effective treatment for patients with COVID-19. So far about 30 drugs have been introduced that one of them is Tocilizumab. Recently Tocilizumab has been introduced to treat patients with COVID-19 and researchers are investigating further the efficacy of this drug for different are patients. In Iran and China, some reports showed a positive effect of Tocilizumab on Saturation of Peripheral Oxygen (SPO2) but results of CT scan in patients in different. In some patients, CT scan showed reduced infiltration, however in other no change was observed. Unfortunately, until now there has been no definitive and effective treatment for patients with COVID-19. Although Tocilizumab has been accepted by China Health Commission to treat infected patients, its positive effects still cannot be predicted in all patients. Based on evidence of the Tocilizumab's effect on the SARS COV 2, researchers hope this drug will make effective and promising treatment to improve lung tissue inflammation in patients with the fatal COVID-19 virus. The present study provides an overview of respiratory inflammation with COVID-19 and probable effect of Tocilizumab on SARS-COV 2.","Samaee, Hamidreza; Mohsenzadegan, Monireh; Ala, Shahram; Maroufi, Shahnam Sedigh; Moradimajd, Parisa",Int Immunopharmacol,,402

Although these policies are effective in containing the spread of the virus, they might represent a challenge to psychological well-being, increasing levels of depressive and anxiety-related symptoms. AIMS: We explored the frequency of anxiety and depression symptoms during COVID-19 restrictions and associations with sociodemographic factors in a Brazilian sample. METHOD: Data of a total of 936 Brazilian adults (68.2% women) aged 18 to 77 years old (M = 38.95, SD = 13.91) were collected through an online survey. RESULTS: In general, we observed a frequency of 17.36% for severe anxiety and 66.13% for severe depression symptoms, in which younger participants (18-39 years old) and women showed higher scores in anxiety and depression scales compared to older age groups. Logistic regressions showed that women were more likely to present severe symptoms of anxiety (20.4%) compared to men (10.9%), as well as respondents in the educational sector (24.3%) compared to those in the health sector (10%). CONCLUSIONS: We highlight the importance of mental health professionals in developing strategies to help younger adults to mitigate the effects of social restriction.","Ribeiro, Fabiana Silva; Santos, Flávia H; Anunciação, Luis; Barrozo, Lucas; Landeira-Fernandez, Jesus; Leist, Anja K",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,402

OBJECTIVE: To provide the first snapshot of immediate impact of COVID-19 on Americans' stress, coping, and guideline adherence. DESIGN: Data were collected from an online workers' platform for survey research (Amazon's Mechanical Turk) from April 7 to 9, 2020. The current data represents the baseline of a longitudinal study. Best practices for ensuring high-quality data were employed. PARTICIPANTS: Individuals who are 18 years of age or older, living in the USA, and English-speaking were eligible for the study. Of 1086 unique responses, 1015 completed responses are included. SETTING: Population-based. MAIN OUTCOMES: Exposure to and stressfulness of COVID-19 stressors, coping strategies, and adherence to CDC guidelines. RESULTS: The sample was 53.9% women (n = 547), with an average age of 38.9 years (SD = 13.50, range = 18-88), most of whom were White (n = 836, 82.4%), non-Hispanic (n = 929, 91.5%), and straight/heterosexual (n = 895, 88.2%); 40% were currently married (n = 407), and 21.6% (n = 219) were caregivers. About half (50.5%) endorsed having at least ""mostly"" enough money to meet their needs. Respondents' locations across the USA ranged from 18.5% in the Northeast to 37.8% in the South. The most commonly experienced stressors were reading/hearing about the severity and contagiousness of COVID-19, uncertainty about length of quarantine and social distancing requirements, and changes to social and daily personal care routines. Financial concerns were rated most stressful. Younger age, female gender, and caregiver status increased risk for stressor exposure and greater degree of stressfulness. The most frequently reported strategies to manage stress were distraction, active coping, and seeking emotional social support. CDC guideline adherence was generally high, but several key social distancing and hygiene behaviors showed suboptimal adherence, particularly for men and younger adults. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Americans have high COVID-19 stress exposure and some demographic subgroups appear particularly vulnerable to stress effects. Subgroups less likely to adhere to CDC guidelines may benefit from targeted information campaigns. these findings may guide mental health interventions and inform policy-making regarding implications of specific public health measures.","Park, Crystal L; Russell, Beth S; Fendrich, Michael; Finkelstein-Fox, Lucy; Hutchison, Morica; Becker, Jessica",J. gen. intern. med,,402

Many studies have modeled the efficiency gains of specimen pooling, but few have systematically evaluated the dilution effect of pooling on the sensitivity of tests. Using the frequency distribution of cycle threshold (Ct ) values of our first 838 SARS-CoV-2 positive specimens, we modeled 100 specimens on the same frequency distribution. Given this distribution, we then tested dilutions of 1:5, 1:10, and 1:50 to find the percentage of specimens positive at each Ct value with each pool size. Using the frequency distribution and the percentage of specimens positive at each Ct value, we estimate that pools of 5 lead to 93% sensitivity, pools of 10 lead to 91% sensitivity, and pools of 50 lead to 81% sensitivity. Pools of 5 and 10 lead to some specimens with Ct values of &#8805;32 becoming negative, while pools of 50 lead to some specimens with Ct values of &#8805;28 becoming negative. These sensitivity estimates can inform laboratories seeking to implement pooling approaches as they seek to balance test efficiency with sensitivity.","Bateman, Allen C; Mueller, Shanna; Guenther, Kyley; Shult, Peter",J. med. virol,,402

371536,Comprehensive work-up is warranted for patients with severe COVID-19 and muscle weakness including respiratory muscles,2021,"The sudden shift to virtual instruction caused by COVID-19 compounded by a large population of students residing outside the campus community has created a number of challenges for students and instructors, alike. The purpose of this investigation was to determine the extent to which these additional burdens impacted student performance. We hypothesized that students in high-risk categories would suffer larger decrements in academic performance compared to students in low-risk categories. To address this hypothesis we collected midterm data from fall 2020 and compared it to midterm data from fall 2015-2019. Midterms are assigned to students earning a C- or below midway through the semester. Letter grades were tallied for each term and then converted to a numerical score using a five-point scale (C- = 1, F = 5) and summed across all midterm grades within a term to allow quantitation and statistical comparison. The number of midterms issued per student did not differ in 2020 compared to 2015-2019 for most demographics. However, when we considered ethnicity we found that Caucasian students had slightly more midterms reported per student in 2020 when compared to the comparison group (p&lt;0.008). Midterm grades were more severe in 2020 (by 0.101-0.657 points) than in 2015-2019 for females, males, first generation students (FGS), non-FGS, and students directly admitted from high school (direct admits) (p&lt;0.001). In addition, Caucasian (p&lt;0.0001), Hispanic (p&lt;0.017), and people of multiple races (p&lt;0.032) had midterms of greater severity in 2020 compared to the comparison group. Interestingly, the number and severity of midterm grades issued to transfer students (TS) were similar between 2020 and the comparison group. When we considered the impact of COVID-19-related changes on midterms/student within paired groups in 2020 we discovered that FG students and minority students had more midterms/student than non-FG (p&lt;0.001) and Caucasian students (p&lt;003), respectively, while males/females and TS/direct admits were similar between groups. Likewise, COVID-19-related changes increased the severity of the midterms for males, FG students, and minority students compared to females (p&lt;0.002), non-FG (p&lt;0.0003), and Caucasian students (p&lt;0.0004), respectively, but TS and direct admits were similar between groups. Collectively, these data indicate a disproportionately negative impact of COVID-19 in some, but not all high-risk populations. It is reasonable to suggest that these negative outcomes may jeopardize retention and graduation rates within these populations.","Selsby, Joshua Bundy Jennifer",The FASEB Journal,,402

STUDY DESIGN: This was a cadaveric radiographic anatomical study. that involved 20 short-haired domestic adult cats. METHODS: Sagittal and frontal plane tibial and femoral joint angles of 40 limbs were measured twice by three observers with different levels of experience. Inter- and intraobserver reliability was determined by the intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC). An ICC > 0.75 was considered high correlation, 0.74 > ICC > 0.60 good correlation, 0.59 > ICC > 0.4 fair correlation and an ICC < 0.40 poor correlation. RESULTS: Mean ± standard deviation angles were anatomic lateral proximal femoral angle (aLPFA) 110.6 ± 3.6; anatomic lateral distal femoral angle (aLDFA) 91.9 ± 2.1; mechanical lateral proximal femoral angle; mLPFA (mLPFA) 107.3 ± 3.6; mechanical lateral distal femoral angle (mLDFA) 95.5 ± 1.7; femoral neck anteversion (FNA) 121.9 ± 4.1; anatomical caudal proximal femoral angle (aCPFA) 156.1 ± 3.9; anatomical caudal distal femoral angle (aCDFA) 101.4 ± 1.4; mechanical medial proximal tibial angle (mMPTA) 93.5 ± 1.2; mechanical medial distal tibial angle (mMDTA) 100.5 ± 2.3; mechanical cranial proximal tibial angle (mCrPTA) 113.1 ± 3.2; tibial plateau angle (TPA) 23.1 ± 3.2; mechanical cranial proximal tibial angle (mCrDTA) 86.7 ± 3.1.The intra-observer ICC indicated high correlation for 70% or more of the measurements. The inter-observer agreement among observers was high. These results show that the radiographic method for measuring femoral and tibial joint angles was good or high, except for FNA and mCrDTA. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides some radiographic anatomical and mechanical joint angles of the femurs and tibias of normal domestic short-haired cats. We found good reliability for both intra- and interobserver measurements.","Palumbo Piccionello, Angela; Salvaggio, Alberto; Volta, Antonella; Emiliozzi, Fabiola; Botto, Riccardo; Dini, Fabrizio; Petazzoni, Massimo",Vet. comp. orthop. traumatol,,402
372876,External validation and update of prediction models for unfavorable outcomes in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 in Japan,2021,"Lockdown curbs the COVID-19 epidemics but at huge costs. Public debates question its impact compared to reliance on individual responsibility. We study how rationally chosen self-protective behavior impacts the spread of the epidemics and interacts with policies. We first assess the value of lockdown in terms of mortality compared to a counterfactual scenario that incorporates self-protection efforts; and second, assess how individual behavior modify the epidemic dynamics when public regulations change. We couple an SLIAR model, that includes asymptomatic transmission, with utility maximization: Individuals trade off economic and wellbeing costs from physical distancing with a lower infection risk. Physical distancing effort depends on risk aversion, perceptions of the epidemics and average distancing effort in the population. Rational distancing effort is computed as a Nash Equilibrium. Equilibrium effort differs markedly from constant, stochastic or proportional contacts reduction. It adjusts to daily incidence of hospitalization in a way that creates a slightly decreasing plateau in epidemic prevalence. Calibration on French data shows that a business-as-usual benchmark yields an overestimation of the number of deaths by a factor of 10 compared to benchmarks with equilibrium efforts. However, lockdown saves nearly twice as many lives as individual efforts alone. Public policies post-lockdown have a limited impact as they partly crowd out individual efforts. Communication that increases risk salience is more effective.","Aubert, Cécile; Augeraud-Véron, Emmanuelle",PLoS One,,402

For this purpose, we consider the design of such systems from a hybrid intelligence (HI) perspective and aim to derive prescriptive design knowledge for CV-based HI systems. We apply a reflective, practice-inspired design science approach and accumulate design knowledge from six comprehensive CV projects. As a result, we identify four design-related mechanisms (i.e., automation, signaling, modification, and collaboration) that inform our derived meta-requirements and design principles.

Over the years, various investigations have purified and characterized mesenchymal stromal/stem cells (MSCs) from different human tissues as cells with multilineage differentiation potential under the appropriate conditions. Due to their appealing characteristics and versatile potentials, MSCs are leveraged in many applications in medicine such as oncology, bioprinting, and as recent as therapeutics discovery and innovation for COVID-19. To date, studies indicate that MSCs have varied differentiation capabilities into different cell types, and demonstrate immunomodulating and anti-inflammatory properties. Different microenvironments or niche for MSCs and their resulting heterogeneity may influence attendant cellular behavior and differentiation capacity. The potential clinical applications of MSCs and exosomes derived from these cells have led to an avalanche of research reports on their properties and hundreds of clinical trials being undertaken. There is ample reason to think, as discussed in this expert review that the future looks bright and promising for MSC research, with many clinical trials under way to ascertain their clinical utility. This review provides a synthesis of the latest advances and trends in MSC research to allow for broad and critically informed use of MSCs.

Previous studies have addressed only the aspect of practice and failed to provide a detailed account of face mask usage amongst community-based populations. This study examined the practice and technique of using face mask amongst adults. METHODS: A cross-sectional descriptive design was adopted. A quota sample of 1500 adults was recruited in Hong Kong during a nonepidemic state between January and February 2017. The participants' practice of using face mask in five given situations was assessed using a questionnaire. Their technique in using face mask, including 12 steps, was assessed using an observation checklist. Statistical tests were used to compare the differences in practice and technique amongst adults of different gender and age groups. RESULTS: Findings revealed that the performance of the participants in both categories was unsatisfactory. In terms of practice, less than one-fifth of the participants reported that they always wore face mask when taking care of family members with fever (14.7%) or respiratory infections (19.5%). Male adults and those aged 55-64 reported low frequency in using face mask during required situations. In terms of technique, none of the participants performed all the required steps in using face mask correctly. More than 90% of the participants did not perform hand hygiene before putting on (91.5%), taking off (97.3%), or after disposing (91.5%) face mask. Adults aged 55 and above performed poorer than adults in the younger age groups. CONCLUSION: Compared with previous findings obtained during an epidemic, the performance of the participants during a nonepidemic state was less satisfactory. The possibility of developing fatigue after exposure to repeated epidemics was discussed. This study contributes to a comprehensive understanding of the use of face mask in a community and reveals the underperformed areas. Effort is required to enhance the proper practice of using face mask, convey the message that hand hygiene is an essential step in wearing and taking off a face mask and increase the public's general concern in the value of using face mask.","Lee, Linda Yin-King; Lam, Evangeline Pui-Wah; Chan, Chiu-Kiu; Chan, Sum-Yi; Chiu, Man-Ki; Chong, Wing-Hei; Chu, Kin-Wai; Hon, Man-Sze; Kwan, Lok-Ki; Tsang, Kit-Lam; Tsoi, Siu-Lai; Wu, Chung-Wai",BMC Public Health,,402
377652,Reply to: Re: Predictors of mortality for patients with COVID-19 pneumonia caused by SARSCoV-2: a prospective cohort study,2020,"In the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, the global fraternity of researchers has been assiduously investigating pharmacological interventions against the SARS-CoV2. This novel virus is known to gain entry through the ACE 2 receptor of pulmonary epithelial cells lining the respiratory tract. Many of its initial symptoms (e.g. difficulty breathing) resemble acute high altitude illnesses, particularly HAPE. Based on these overt symptoms, a number of high altitude researchers have speculated on repurposing of drugs used to treat acute altitude illnesses (especially HAPE). However, eminent high altitude researchers with medical expertise as well as some studies on the deeper causes underlying the overt symptoms have found that such repurposing maybe counter-productive. Other factors, (e.g. contra-indications of these drugs), make their use in COVID-19 patients hazardous. The fit-for-repurposing options maybe experimental prophylactic interventions (e.g. silymarin, curcumin) which have proven anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory effects. Another line of thought focuses on proteomics-based investigations of such patients. However, apart from the logistical and safety issues, a targeted proteomics approach based on prior sound molecular investigations is a more logical approach instead of mere shotgun proteomics. In this commentary, we shed light on such issues associated with COVID-19.","Ahmad, Yasmin; Paul, Subhojit; Varshney, Rajeev; Kumar, Bhuvnesh",J Proteins Proteom,,402

Endotracheal intubation using videolaryngoscopy was timed. Participants completed pre- and post- simulation questionnaires. Results: 29 participants from the Department of Anesthesia were included in the study. Pre- and post- simulation questionnaire responses supported acceptance of additional barriers. There was no significant difference in intubating times across all groups (PPE vs IC 95% CI, 26.3-35.1; PPE vs AB 95% CI, 25.9-35.5; IC vs AB 95% CI, 23.6-39.1). Comparison of post-simulation questionnaire responses between IC and AB showed no significant difference. Participants did not find the additional barriers negatively affected communication, visualization or maneuverability. Conclusions: Overall, the IC and AB were comparable, and there was no negative impact on performance under testing conditions. Our study suggests the positive acceptance of additional patient protection barriers by anesthesia providers during airway management.","Querney, Jill; Cubillos, Javier; Ding, Youshan; Cherry, Richard; Armstrong, Kevin",Korean j. anesthesiol.,,402

This paper uses a simplified yet reliable method to analyse the potential growth and employment effects of this stimulus plan. Based on lower and upper bound values of the country's estimated fiscal multipliers, we built a scenario prediction template with which output and employment expansion can be analysed within specified constraints on the fiscal space and the country's economic dynamics. Our estimation model suggests that with a 50% state participation in the recovery investment, the best case scenario of fiscal stimulation would enable the economy to create 2.23 million jobs over the first 5 years of the stimulus investments (of which 1.74 million would be attributed to the stimulus effect), while the more realistic scenario based of the lower bound value of the fiscal multiplier with only 30% state participation predicts the creation of 1.67 million additional jobs, of which 1.18 million would be attributable to the stimulus. Our analysis also suggests that investing in the types of infrastructure that shift the production technology could change the long-term growth trajectory, while focusing on employment-intensive investment may only generate temporary effects.","Habiyaremye, Alexis; Molewa, Olebogeng; Lekomanyane, Pelontle",Eur J Dev Res,,402

Studies demonstrate that upregulation of ACE2 has a protective effect on SARS-CoV-2 illness severity. Moreover, animal studies demonstrate that dietary intake can modulate ACE2 gene expression and function. A high intake of resveratrol may have a protective role, upregulating ACE2, whereas a high intake of dietary fat may have a detrimental role, downregulating ACE2. As such, we postulate on the biological plausibility of interactions between dietary fat and/or resveratrol and ACE2 gene variations in the modulation of SARS-CoV-2 illness severity. We call to action the research community to test this plausible interaction in a sample of human subjects.","Horne, Justine R; Vohl, Marie-Claude",Am J Physiol Endocrinol Metab,,402

The payoffs of the agents depend on the social distancing they practice and on the probability of getting infected. We consider two types of agents, the vulnerable agents who have a small cost if they get infected, and the non-vulnerable agents who have a higher cost. For the modeling of the epidemic outbreak, a variant of the SIR model is considered, involving populations of susceptible, infected, and recovered persons of vulnerable and non-vulnerable types. The Nash equilibria of this social distancing game are studied. We then analyze the case where the players, desiring to achieve a low social inequality, pose a bound on the variance of the payoffs. In this case, we introduce a notion of Generalized Nash Equilibrium (GNE) for games with a continuum of players and characterize the GNE. We then present some numerical results. It turns out that inequality constraints result in a slower spread of the epidemic and an improved cost for the vulnerable players. Furthermore, it is possible that inequality constraints are beneficial for non-vulnerable players as well.","Kordonis, Ioannis; Lagos, Athanasios-Rafail; Papavassilopoulos, George P.",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.00146v1.pdf,402

SARS-CoV-2 infection is associated with oxidative stress that triggers cytokine production, inflammation, and other pathophysiological processes. Glutathione-S-transferase (GST) is an important enzyme that catalyzes the conjugation of glutathione (GSH) with electrophiles to protect the cell from oxidative damage and participates in the antioxidant defense mechanism in the lungs. Thus, in this study, we investigated the role of GSTM1 and GSTT1 gene polymorphism with COVID-19 susceptibility, as well as its outcome. The study included 269 RT-PCR confirmed COVID-19 patients with mild (n = 149) and severe (n = 120) conditions. All subjects were genotyped for GSTM1 and GSTT1 by multiplex polymerase chain reaction (mPCR) followed by statistical analysis. The frequency of GSTM1-/- , GSTT1-/- and GSTM1-/- /GSTT1-/- was higher in severe COVID-19 patients as compared to mild patients but we did not observe a significant association. In the Cox hazard model, death was significantly 2.28-fold higher in patients with the GSTT1-/- genotype (p = 0.047). In combination, patients having GSTM1+/+ and GSTT1-/- genotypes showed a poor survival rate (p = 0.02). Our results suggested that COVID-19 patients with the GSTT1-/- genotype showed higher mortality.","Abbas, Mohammad; Verma, Sushma; Verma, Shrikant; Siddiqui, Sahabjada; Khan, Faizan H; Raza, Syed T; Siddiqi, Zeba; Eba, Ale; Mahdi, Farzana",J Med Virol,,402

Our contribution is devoted to provide a possible planning of the needs of medical infrastructures in the Pavia Province and to suggest different scenarios about the vaccination campaign which possibly help in reducing the fatalities and/or reducing the number of infected in the population. The proposed research combines a new mathematical description of the spread of an infectious diseases which takes into account both age and average daily social contacts with a detailed analysis of the dataset of all traced infected individuals in the Province of Pavia. These information are used to develop a data-driven model in which calibration and feeding of the model are extensively used. The epidemiological evolution is obtained by relying on an approach based on statistical mechanics. This leads to study the evolution over time of a system of probability distributions characterizing the age and social contacts of the population. One of the main outcomes shows that, as expected, the spread of the disease is closely related to the mean number of contacts of individuals. The model permits to forecast thanks to an uncertainty quantification approach and in the short time horizon, the average number and the confidence bands of expected hospitalized classified by age and to test different options for an effective vaccination campaign with age-decreasing priority.","Zanella, M.; Bardelli, C.; Dimarco, G.; Deandrea, S.; Perotti, P.; Azzi, M.; Figini, S.; Toscani, G.",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.06027v2.pdf,402

A majority of the Finnish COVID-19 patients are cared for in the Helsinki University Hospital district. The psychological distress of the Helsinki University Hospital personnel has been followed via an electronic survey monthly since June 2020. We report six-month follow-up results of a prospective 18-month cohort study. Individual variation explained much more of the total variance in psychological distress (68.5%, 95% CI 65.2-71.9%) and negative changes in sleep (75.6%, 95% CI 72.2-79.2%) than the study survey wave (1.6%, CI 0.5-5.5%; and 0.3%, CI 0.1-1.2%). Regional COVID-19 incidence rates correlated with the personnel's psychological distress.

However, the sector is confronted with numerous socio-demographic trends that will shape its ability to be financially successful and contribute to public health. The sector must understand current drivers of change and the skills its workforce needs to navigate them. As such, using the results of a 2019 Delphi Survey of over 50 fitness experts from 26 countries, we aim to define the drivers of change facing the sector and identify the skills needed by the fitness workforce to navigate these changes. We find that several technological, social, health and economic trends affect the sector. As a result, so-called soft skills such as communication or customer service, along with digital technology skills, are becoming increasingly important. There is also growing recognition that fitness professionals need to be trained to work with a number of special populations. Furthermore, we argue that many of the trends identified here-such as the increasing use of technology or the focus on individual customer needs-have been accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic. We conclude by arguing that well-developed, pan-European qualifications are needed to address these common issues.","Moustakas, Louis; Szumilewicz, Anna; Mayo, Xian; Thienemann, Elisabeth; Grant, Andrew",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,402

However, COVID-19 has helped to expedite the transition to supplement or replace traditional learning styles with computer-based learning.1 Many medical imaging and radiation therapy educational programs are transitioning to distance learning and simulated laboratories for a variety of reasons. Wertz et al argued that traditional pedagogical techniques are not suited for modern adult learners in the radiologic sciences because today’s adult learners have experienced some form of higher education through self-paced learning environments. A selfpaced learning environment consists of feedback that is learner-controlled and given in real-time.2 Educators are using pedagogical innovation in the profession as well as adapting to modern learning theories by transforming traditional programs into hybrid programs consisting of face-to-face and distance learning methods.1 With this progression in radiologic science education methods, the Joint Review Committee on Education in Radiologic Technology (JRCERT) provided guidelines for programs implementing distance learning methods that require programs to have procedures for maintaining the integrity of distance education courses.3 In addition, JRCERT encourages innovation in education, including the delivery of distance education.3 A distance education checklist in accordance with the 2021 JRCERT Standards for an Accredited Educational Program is available for program faculty and site visitors. © 2021, Radiologic Technology.

Conversely, flavored milk sales remain strong, but many adults avoid flavored milk because of concerns about added sugar and calories and/or excessive sweetness. Here we used two discrete choice experiments to assess interest for a dark chocolate milk drink in adults, and explored whether there might be a consumer segment who prefers a more bitter, lower sugar chocolate milk. Adults were recruited from the Mid-Atlantic region of the United States for two conjoint analysis studies. In a general population cohort (n = 735), type of sweetener was the most important attribute (24%), followed by milk fat (19%), grams of added sugar (16%), front of pack messaging (15%), package type (12%), carton size (8%), and protein content (6%). Attribute importance was relatively consistent in a second study with a younger, more physically active cohort (n = 1017). Product choices in the active cohort were related to orthorexia and physically activity scores, indicating revealed preferences in a choice task are reflective of personal lifestyle and eating behavior. In both cohorts, three consistent consumer segments were identified and characterized: the calorie conscious, the average consumer, and the natural eaters. These data can help uncover lifestyle differences between adult consumers that impact their food product choices.","Brodock, Jennifer L; Hayes, John E; Masterson, Travis D; Hopfer, Helene",Appetite,,402

In this work, a Au@Ti3C2@PEI-Ru(dcbpy)32+ nanocomposite-based electrochemiluminescence (ECL) biosensor was rationally designed, which realized sensitive detection of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) gene of SARS-CoV-2. In addition, a DNA walker was also used to excise the hairpin DNAs under the action of Nb.BbvCI endonuclease. Furthermore, model DNA-Ag nanoclusters (model DNA-AgNCs) were used to quench the initial ECL signal. As a result, the ECL biosensor was used to sensitively detect the SARS-CoV-2 RdRp gene with a detection range of 1 fM to 100 pM and a limit of detection of 0.21 fM. It was indicated that the ECL biosensor had a great application potential for clinical medical detection.

A national lockdown was implemented on 15 March 2020.AimTo describe reported cases and the impact of national lockdown, and to identify disease severity risk factors.MethodsNational surveillance data were used to describe PCR-confirmed cases as at 27 April 2020. We compared case characteristics by severity categories (hospitalisation, admission to intensive care unit (ICU), death) and identified severity risk factors using multivariable regression.ResultsThe epidemic peaked on 20 March. Of 218,652 COVID-19 cases, 45.4% were hospitalised, 4.6% were admitted to ICU and 11.9% died. Among those who died, 94.8% had at least one underlying disease. Healthcare workers (HCWs) represented 22.9% of cases. Males were more likely to have severe outcomes than females. Cardiovascular disease was a consistent risk factor. Patients with pneumonia had higher odds of hospitalisation (odds ratio (OR): 26.63; 95% confidence interval (CI): 25.03-28.33). The strongest predictor of death was age &#8805; 80 years (OR: 28.4; 95% CI: 19.85-40.78). Among underlying diseases, chronic renal disease had highest odds of death (OR: 1.47; 95% CI: 1.29-1.68).ConclusionsCOVID-19 case numbers began declining 6 days after the national lockdown.

To provide possible directions for future research, this report explored the impact of the Belgian COVID-19 lockdown measures on patients with bulimia nervosa (BN). METHODS: The data of 15 female patients with BN from an ongoing experience sampling method study were analyzed. Mixed effects models compared surroundings, social context, negative affect (NA), positive affect (PA) and binge eating before and after the implementation of the lockdown measures. RESULTS: After the implementation of the lockdown measures, significant changes in surroundings and social context were found as well as an increase in NA and decrease in PA. Patients who experienced a higher binge eating frequency during the lockdown also experienced a stronger change in NA and PA. CONCLUSIONS: Future research should also look at changes in surroundings, social context, affect and how these interact with factors such as personality traits and coping styles when investigating why some patients are more susceptible to the negative effects of lockdown measures than others.","Leenaerts, Nicolas; Vaessen, Thomas; Ceccarini, Jenny; Vrieze, Elske",Eat Behav,,402

This data allow the design of secondary analyses that take advantage of this information to create new knowledge. One of these feasible analyses is the evaluation of the expression level for a gene through a series of different conditions or cell types. Based on this idea, we have developed Automatic and Serial Analysis of CO-expression, which performs expression profiles for a given gene along hundreds of heterogeneous and normalized transcriptomics experiments and discover other genes that show either a similar or an inverse behavior. It might help to discover co-regulated genes, and common transcriptional regulators in any biological model. The present severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic is an opportunity to test this novel approach due to the wealth of data that are being generated, which could be used for validating results. Thus, we have identified 35 host factors in the literature putatively involved in the infectious cycle of SARS-CoV viruses and searched for genes tightly co-expressed with them. We have found 1899 co-expressed genes whose assigned functions are strongly related to viral cycles. Moreover, this set of genes heavily overlaps with those identified by former laboratory high-throughput screenings (with P-value near 0). Our results reveal a series of common regulators, involved in immune and inflammatory responses that might be key virus targets to induce the coordinated expression of SARS-CoV-2 host factors.","Pérez-Pulido, Antonio J; Asencio-Cortés, Gualberto; Brokate-Llanos, Ana M; Brea-Calvo, Gloria; Rodríguez-Griñolo, Rosario; Garzón, Andrés; Muñoz, Manuel J",Brief. bioinform,,402

Although early therapies such as prophylactic antibodies and vaccines show great promise, there are concerns about the long-term efficacy and universal applicability of these therapies as the virus continues to mutate. Thus, protein-based immunogens that can quickly respond to viral changes remain of continued interest. The Spike protein, the main immunogen of this virus, displays a highly dynamic trimeric structure that presents a challenge for therapeutic development. Here, guided by the structure of the Spike trimer, we rationally design new Spike constructs that show a uniquely high stability profile while simultaneously remaining locked into the immunogen-desirable prefusion state. Furthermore, our approach emphasizes the relationship between the highly conserved S2 region and structurally dynamic Receptor Binding Domains (RBD) to enable vaccine development as well as the generation of antibodies able to resist viral mutation.","Riley, Timothy P; Chou, Hui-Ting; Hu, Ruozhen; Bzymek, Krzysztof P; Correia, Ana R; Partin, Alexander C; Li, Danqing; Gong, Danyang; Wang, Zhulun; Yu, Xinchao; Manzanillo, Paolo; Garces, Fernando",Front Immunol,,402

Development of effective vaccines or treatments for SARS-CoV-2 infection will be aided by a molecular-level understanding of SARS-CoV-2 proteins and their interactions with host cell proteins. The SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid (N) protein is highly homologous to the N protein of SARS-CoV, which is essential for viral RNA replication and packaging into new virions. Emerging models indicate that nucleocapsid proteins of other viruses can form biomolecular condensates to spatiotemporally regulate N protein localization and function. Our bioinformatic analyses, in combination with pre-existing experimental evidence, suggest that the SARS-CoV-2 N protein is capable of forming or regulating biomolecular condensates in vivo by interaction with RNA and key host cell proteins. We discuss multiple models, whereby the N protein of SARS-CoV-2 may harness this activity to regulate viral life cycle and host cell response to viral infection.","Cascarina, Sean M; Ross, Eric D",FASEB j,,402

By April of 2020, COVID-19 infections had become a worldwide pandemic with nearly 3 million infections and over 200,000 deaths. The relative contributions of virus replication and cytopathic effects or immunopathological host responses to the severe and fatal outcomes of COVID-19 lung infections have as yet to be determined.

In this study, we aimed to evaluate the risk factors for mortality in severe and critical COVID-19 patients. METHODS: We performed a retrospective study of patients diagnosed with severe and critical COVID-19 from four hospitals in Wuhan, China, by evaluating the clinical characteristics and laboratory results, and using Cox proportional hazards model to assess the risk factors involved in disease progression. RESULTS: In total, 446 patients with COVID-19 were enrolled. The study indicated a high mortality rate (20.2%) in severe and critical COVID-19 patients. At the time of admission, all patients required oxygen therapy, and 52 (12%) required invasive mechanical ventilation, of which 50 (96%) died. The univariate Cox proportional hazards model showed a white blood cell count of more than 10 × 109/L (HR 3.993,95%CI 2.469 to 6.459) that correlated with an increased mortality rate. The multivariable Cox proportional hazards model demonstrated that older age (HR 1.066, 95% CI 1.043 to 1.089) and higher white blood cell count (HR 1.135, 95% CI 1.080 to 1.192) were independent risk factors for determining COVID-19 associated mortality.

The purpose of this review is to discuss the approach to management of patients with immune-mediated diseases during the COVID-19 pandemic. RECENT FINDINGS: At present, there is little evidence to suggest an increased risk of COVID-19 infection or its complications in patients with immune-mediated diseases or associated with conventional or biologic disease modifying antirheumatic drugs; however, glucocorticoid use does appear to have negative associations. SUMMARY: Currently, conventional and biologic disease modifying antirheumatic drugs can be continued in the absence of SARS-CoV-2 exposure. In the case of exposure, with the exception of hydroxyhcloroquine and sulfasalazine, immunosuppression should be held for 2 weeks.

METHOD: A review of the literature on disability and COVID-19 is provided, with an emphasis on sources of trauma and stress that disproportionately impact the disability community and the ways in which disability intersects with other marginalized identities in the context of trauma and the pandemic. We also reflect on the potential impacts on the field of psychology and the ways in which psychologists, led by rehabilitation psychologists, can support disabled clients and the broader disability community at both the individual client and systemic levels. RESULTS: The COVID-19 pandemic introduces unique potential sources of trauma and stress within the disability community, including concerns about health care rationing and ableism in health care, isolation, and the deaths and illnesses of loved ones and community members. CONCLUSIONS/IMPLICATIONS: Rehabilitation psychologists and other professionals should be aware of the potential for trauma and stress among disabled clients and work with them to mitigate its effects. Additionally, psychologists should also work with the disability community and disabled colleagues to address systemic and institutional ableism and its intersections with other forms of oppression.

We present the 'Contactless' model, a comprehensive operational tool including a plurality of services delivered remotely, structured according to a complexity gradient, aimed to cover diagnostic procedures and monitor disease progression in chronic pediatric patients. METHODS: A multidisciplinary and multiprofessional project team was recruited, in collaboration with patients' associations, to map a panel of available Evidence-Based solutions and address individual needs in full respect of the concept of personalized medicine. The solutions include a number of services from videoconsultations to more structure videotraining sessions. RESULTS: A modular framework made up of four three Macro-levels of complexity - Contactless Basic, Intermediate and Advanced - was displayed as an incremental set of services and operational planning establishing each phase, from factors influencing eligibility to the delivery of the most accurate and complex levels of care. CONCLUSION: The multimodal, multidisciplinary 'Contactless' model allowed the inclusion of all Units of our Pediatric Department and families with children with disability or complex chronic conditions. The strengths of this project rely on its replicability outside of pediatrics and in the limited resources needed to practically impact patients, caregivers and professionals involved in the process of care.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Adult patients hospitalized from January 1, 2020, through May 8, 2020, who had COVID-19 testing by polymerase chain reaction assay were identified through electronic health records across multiple hospitals in the Mayo Clinic enterprise. Thrombotic outcomes (venous and arterial) were identified from the hospital problem list. RESULTS: We identified 3790 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 testing across 19 hospitals, 102 of whom had positive test results. The median age was lower in the COVID-positive patients (62 vs 67 years; P=.03). The median duration of hospitalization was longer in COVID-positive patients (8.5 vs 4 days; P<.001) and more required intensive care unit care (56.9% [58 of 102] vs 26.8% [987 of 3688]; P<.001). Comorbidities, including atrial fibrillation/flutter, heart failure, chronic kidney disease, and malignancy, were observed less frequently with COVID-positive admissions. Any venous thromboembolism was identified in 2.9% of COVID-positive patients (3 of 102) and 4.6% of COVID-negative patients (168 of 3688). The frequency of venous and arterial events was not different between the groups. The unadjusted odds ratio (OR) for COVID-positive-patients for any venous thromboembolism was 0.63 (95% CI, 0.19 to 2.02). A multivariable logistic regression model evaluated death within 30 days of hospital discharge; neither COVID positivity (adjusted OR, 1.12; 95% CI, 0.54 to 2.34) nor thromboembolism (adjusted OR, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.60 to 1.32) was associated with death. CONCLUSION: Early experience in patients with COVID-19 across multiple academic and regional hospitals representing different US regions demonstrates a lower than previously reported incidence of thrombotic events. This incidence was not higher than a contemporary COVID-negative hospitalized comparator.","Chaudhary, Rahul; Padrnos, Leslie; Wysokinska, Ewa; Pruthi, Rajiv; Misra, Sanjay; Sridharan, Meera; Wysokinski, Waldemar; McBane, Robert D; Houghton, Damon E",Mayo Clin Proc,,402

After admission for pneumonia, her average daily blood glucose (BG) levels remained at 300-400 mg/dL, although the required dosage of subcutaneous insulin markedly increased (~ 150 units/day; ~ 2.63 units/kg/day). Furthermore, the patient had generalized edema along with hypoalbuminemia, developed extensive abdominal purpuras, and had increased plasma D-dimer levels during treatment, suggestive of coagulation abnormalities. Therefore, intravenous infusion of regular insulin was initiated. The BG level subsequently decreased to < 200 mg/dL 2 days after administering 18 units/day of insulin infusion and 118 units/day of subcutaneous insulin, suggesting that subcutaneous insulin alone might have been ineffective in reducing hyperglycemia, which is clinically consistent with the characteristics of an SIR syndrome. Impaired skin microcirculation arising from coagulation abnormalities, subcutaneous edema associated with inflammation-related hypoalbuminemia or vascular hyperpermeability, and/or reduction in subcutaneous blood flow due to COVID-19-induced downregulation of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 might be associated with the development of pathological conditions that resemble SIR syndrome, leading to impaired subcutaneous insulin absorption.

Data to assess risk factors for illness severity among pregnant women with COVID-19 are limited. This study aimed to determine risk factors associated with COVID-19 illness severity among pregnant women with SARS-CoV-2 infection. METHODS: Pregnant women with SARS-CoV-2 infection confirmed by molecular testing were reported during March 29, 2020-March 5, 2021 through the Surveillance for Emerging Threats to Mothers and Babies Network (SET-NET). Criteria for illness severity (asymptomatic, mild, moderate-to-severe, or critical) were adapted from National Institutes of Health and World Health Organization criteria. Crude and adjusted risk ratios for moderate-to-severe or critical COVID-19 illness were calculated for selected demographic and clinical characteristics. RESULTS: Among 7,950 pregnant women with SARS-CoV-2 infection, moderate-to-severe or critical COVID-19 illness was associated with age 25 years and older, healthcare occupation, pre-pregnancy obesity, chronic lung disease, chronic hypertension, and pregestational diabetes mellitus. Risk of moderate-to-severe or critical illness increased with the number of underlying medical or pregnancy-related conditions. CONCLUSIONS: Older age and having underlying medical conditions were associated with increased risk of moderate-to-severe or critical COVID-19 illness among pregnant women. This information might help pregnant women understand their risk for moderate-to-severe or critical COVID-19 illness and inform targeted public health messaging.","Galang, Romeo R; Newton, Suzanne M; Woodworth, Kate R; Griffin, Isabel; Oduyebo, Titilope; Sancken, Christina L; Olsen, Emily O039; Malley,; Aveni, Kathryn; Wingate, Heather; Shephard, Hanna; Fussman, Chris; Alaali, Zahra S; Silcox, Kristin; Siebman, Samantha; Halai, Umme-Aiman; Lopez, Camille Delgado; Lush, Mamie; Sokale, Ayomide; Barton, Jerusha; Chaudhary, Ifrah; Patrick, Paul H; Schlosser, Levi; Reynolds, Bethany; Gaarenstroom, Nicole; Chicchelly, Sarah; Read, Jennifer S; de Wilde, Leah; Mbotha, Deborah; Azziz-Baumgartner, Eduardo; Hall, Aron J; Tong, Van T; Ellington, Sascha; Gilboa, Suzanne M",Clin. infect. dis,,402

SCAD has been mostly studied in the West, with little recognition in Asia leading to under-diagnosis and under-representation. In this review, we highlight two distinct cases occurring at our center in Singapore, affecting two Singaporean women of Malay and Chinese descent. These 2 cases highlight that pregnancy-associated SCAD is neither the most common nor only manifestation of SCAD. Through review of the literature, we emphasize the heterogeneity in case presentation paying particular attention to SCAD and its association with connective tissue disorders such as fibromuscular dysplasia. SCAD remains a diagnostic challenge for many cardiologists, here we shed light and dispel myths surrounding coronary angiography and review the use of intracoronary imaging. The successful treatment of this unique group of patients requires a high index of suspicion, and management within a multidisciplinary team. The development of a recovery program with access to support groups, allied health, and cardiac rehabilitation is paramount in improving outcomes for these patients in the long term. Further research and studies in our Asian population will help to enhance our understanding of this disease and develop practices to best manage our patients.","Low, Ting-Ting; Houdmont, Marie; Sim, Hui W; Chan, Koo H; Loh, Poay H; Loh, Joshua P",Clin. cardiol,,402

The results of recent studies have suggested that neonates may present symptoms of COVID-19. Although the presentation of the disease in neonates is known to vary, only a limited number of studies have investigated newborns infected with COVID-19. CASE PRESENTATION: This study presents two Asian cases of newborns with COVID-19. Maternal-fetal or postnatal transmission was suggested based on the simultaneity of maternal infection. Chest radiography in one of the neonates showed severe lung involvement. Despite support and resuscitation attempts, the poor clinical condition of the neonate led to his death. However, the two mothers and one of the neonates were discharged from the hospital in good general condition. CONCLUSION: The neonates had worse clinical conditions than the mothers, and the intensity of pneumonia and level of lung involvement in the newborns were not associated with the stage and severity of the disease in the mothers with COVID-19.","Moeindarbary, Somayeh; Pourhoseini, Azam; Layegh, Parvaneh; Shahriari, Zahra; Fayyaz, Faezeh; Bahrami, Milad; Rafiee, Mahdi",J Med Case Rep,,402

Data were collected at three timepoints (May to August 2020). Here, we show that both family- and neighborhood-level disadvantage were associated with parentsa TM reports of greater family COVID-19 exposure risk and diagnoses, less perceived exposure risk, more frequent parent-youth conversations about COVID-19 risk/prevention and reassurance, and greater youth preventative behaviors. More disadvantaged families may be adaptively incorporating more protective strategies to reduce emotional distress and likelihood of COVID-19 infection.

In the present paper, we used a representative sample of adults in Michigan to examine differences in COVID-19 impacts on Blacks and Whites in four domains: direct, perceived, political, and behavioral. We found that in the initial wave of the outbreak in May 2020, Blacks experienced more severe direct impacts: they were more likely to be diagnosed or know someone who was diagnosed, and more likely to lose their job compared to Whites. In addition, Blacks differed significantly from Whites in their assessment of COVID-19's threat to public health and the economy, the adequacy of government responses to COVID-19, and the appropriateness of behavioral changes to mitigate COVID-19's spread. Although in many cases these views of COVID-19 were also associated with political ideology, this association was significantly stronger for Whites than Blacks. Continued investigation of racial disparities in COVID-19's impact is necessary; however, these preliminary findings of a race-by-ideology interaction are important because they suggest some racial disparities are restricted to conservatives, while more liberal Whites and Blacks exhibit few differences.","Anderson-Carpenter, Kaston D; Neal, Zachary P",J. racial ethnic health disparities (Internet),,402

Here, we assessed the coronavirus disease (COVID-19)-related diagnostic workload during the onset of the pandemic in the central laboratory of Benin, Western Africa; characterized 12 SARS-CoV-2 genomes from returning travelers; and validated the Da An RT-PCR-based diagnostic kit that is widely used across Africa. We found a 15-fold increase in the monthly laboratory workload due to COVID-19, dealt with at the cost of routine activities. Genomic surveillance showed near-simultaneous introduction of distinct SARS-CoV-2 lineages termed A.4 and B.1, including the D614G spike protein variant potentially associated with higher transmissibility from travelers from six different European and African countries during March-April 2020. We decoded the target regions within the ORF1ab and N genes of the Da An dual-target kit by MinION-based amplicon sequencing. Despite relatively high similarity between SARS-CoV-2 and endemic human coronaviruses (HCoVs) within the ORF1ab target domain, no cross-detection of high-titered cell culture supernatants of HCoVs was observed, suggesting high analytical specificity. The Da An kit was highly sensitive, detecting 3.2 to 9.0 copies of target-specific in vitro transcripts/reaction. Although discrepant test results were observed in low-titered clinical samples, clinical sensitivity of the Da An kit was at least comparable to that of commercial kits from affluent settings. In sum, virologic diagnostics are achievable in a resource-limited setting, but unprecedented pressure resulting from COVID-19-related diagnostics requires rapid and sustainable support of national and supranational stakeholders addressing limited laboratory capacity.IMPORTANCE Months after the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, case numbers from Africa are surprisingly low, potentially because the number of SARS-CoV-2 tests performed in Africa is lower than in other regions. Here, we show an overload of COVID-19-related diagnostics in the central laboratory of Benin, Western Africa, with a stagnating average number of positive samples irrespective of daily sample counts. SARS-CoV-2 genomic surveillance confirmed a high genomic diversity in Benin introduced by travelers returning from Europe and other African countries, including early circulation of the D614G spike mutation associated with potentially higher transmissibility. We validated a widely used RT-PCR kit donated by the Chinese Jack Ma Foundation and confirmed high analytical specificity and clinical sensitivity equivalent to tests used in affluent settings. Our assessment shows that although achievable in an African setting, the burden from COVID-19-related diagnostics on national reference laboratories is very high.","Sander, Anna-Lena; Yadouleton, Anges; Moreira-Soto, Andres; Tchibozo, Carine; Hounkanrin, Gildas; Badou, Yvette; Fischer, Carlo; Krause, Nina; Akogbeto, Petas; F de Oliveira Filho, Edmilson; Dossou, Anges; Brünink, Sebastian; Drosten, Christian; Aïssi, Melchior A Joël; Harouna Djingarey, Mamoudou; Hounkpatin, Benjamin; Nagel, Michael; Drexler, Jan Felix",MSphere,,402

We sought to assess the risk of adverse clinical outcomes among patients undergoing coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery during the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic period and compare the risks with those undergoing CABG before the pandemic in the year 2019. Methods: A retrospective cross-sectional analysis of the TriNetX Research Network database was performed. Patients undergoing CABG between January 20, 2019, and September 15, 2019, contributed to the 2019 cohort, and those undergoing CABG between January 20, 2020, and September 15, 2020, contributed to the 2020 cohort. Propensity-score matching was performed, and the odds of mortality, acute kidney injury, stroke, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and mechanical ventilation occurring by 30 days were evaluated. Results: The number of patients undergoing CABG in 2020 declined by 35.5% from 5534 patients in 2019 to 3569 patients in 2020. After propensity-score matching, 3569 patient pairs were identified in the 2019 and the 2020 cohorts. Compared with those undergoing CABG in 2019, the odds of mortality by 30 days were 0.96 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.69-1.33; P = .80) in those undergoing CABG in 2020. The odds for stroke (odds ratio [OR], 1.201; 95% CI, 0.96-1.39), acute kidney injury (OR, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.59-1.08), acute respiratory distress syndrome (OR, 1.01; 95% CI, 0.60-2.42), and mechanical ventilation (OR, 1.11; 95% CI, 0.94-1.30) were similar between the 2 cohorts.

This order affected different neighborhoods differently, as stores and workplaces are not randomly distributed across the city, and different populations may have responded differently to the out-of-home restrictions. This study examines how the business closures and activity restrictions affected COVID-19 testing results. An evaluation of whether such actions slowed the spread of the pandemic is a crucial step in designing effective public health policies. METHODS: Daily data on the fraction of COVID-19 tests yielding a positive result at the zip code level were analyzed in relation to the number of visits to local businesses (based on smartphone location) and the number of smartphones that stayed fixed at their home location. The regression model also included vectors of fixed effects for the day of the week, the calendar date, and the zip code of residence. RESULTS: A large number of visits to local businesses increased the positivity rate of COVID-19 tests, while a large number of smartphones that stayed at home decreased it. A doubling in the relative number of visits increases the positivity rate by about 12.4 percentage points (95% CI, 5.3 to 19.6). A doubling in the relative number of stay-at-home devices lowered it by 2.0 percentage points (95% CI, -2.9 to -1.2). The business closures and out-of-home activity restrictions decreased the positivity rate, accounting for approximately 25% of the decline observed in April and May 2020. CONCLUSION: Policy measures decreased the likelihood of positive results in COVID-19 tests. These specific policy tools may be successfully used when comparable health crises arise in the future.","Borjas, George J",Prev Chronic Dis,,402

411300,Assessment of the nutritional status of severely ill COVID-19 patients and possible risk factors,2021,"Low power long-range networks like LoRa have become increasingly mainstream for Internet of Things deployments. Given the versatility of applications that these protocols enable, they support many data rates and bandwidths. Yet, for a given network that supports hundreds of devices over multiple miles, the network operator typically needs to specify the same configuration or among a small subset of configurations for all the client devices to communicate with the gateway. This one-size-fits-all approach is highly inefficient in large networks. We propose an alternative approach -- we allow network devices to transmit at any data rate they choose. The gateway uses the first few symbols in the preamble to classify the correct data rate, switches its configuration, and then decodes the data. Our design leverages the inherent asymmetry in outdoor IoT deployments where the clients are power-starved and resource-constrained, but the gateway is not. Our gateway design, Proteus, runs a neural network architecture and is backward compatible with existing LoRa protocols. Our experiments reveal that Proteus can identify the correct configuration with over 97% accuracy in both indoor and outdoor deployments. Our network architecture leads to a 3.8 to 11 times increase in throughput for our LoRa testbed.","Kapetanovic, Zerina; Vasisht, Deepak; Chakraborty, Tusher; Smith, Joshua R.; Chandra, Ranveer",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2109.05103v1.pdf,402

Camel testes were collected at the abattoir after animal slaughtering and kept at 4 °C during transportation and until processing (max 6 h). Spermatozoa were retrieved and diluted with SHOTOR extender, split in aliquots, supplemented with the following antioxidants: 200 µm/mL vitamin E, 1.0 g/L vitamin C, 1 µg/mL selenium nanoparticles, 50 µg/mL zinc nanoparticles, 2 µg/mL sodium selenite, and 100 µg/mL zinc sulfate, and stored at 4 °C for 2, 48, 96, and 144 h. The storage time significantly affected (P < 0.05) the sperms' motility and livability, the sperms' membrane integrity, and the percentages of cytoplasmic droplets as well as the percentage of morphologically normal spermatozoa. Epididymal sperm characteristics (progressive motility, livability, membrane integrity, and abnormalities) were significantly improved (P < 0.05) when the spermatozoa were diluted with antioxidants as compared with the control group, and the best additives were identified as nano-selenium, sodium selenite, nano-zinc, and zinc sulfate. In conclusion, adding nano-sized minerals or inorganic trace elements and vitamins maintained the progressive motility, livability, and membrane integrity, and decreased abnormalities and cytoplasmic droplet percentages of epididymal camel spermatozoa stored at 4 °C up to 144 h.","Shahin, Mohamed A; Khalil, Wael A; Saadeldin, Islam M; Swelum, Ayman A; El-Harairy, Mostafa A",Trop Anim Health Prod,,402

412703,Clinical prediction model for postoperative ambulatory ability outcomes in patients with trochanteric fractures,2021,"BACKGROUND: Inertial measurement unit (IMU)-based motion capture systems are gaining popularity for gait analysis outside laboratories. It is important to determine the performance of such systems in specific patient populations. We aimed to validate and determine within-day reliability of an IMU system for measuring lower limb gait kinematics and temporal-spatial parameters (TSP) in people with and without HIV. METHODS: Gait was recorded in eight adults with HIV (PLHIV) and eight HIV-seronegative participants (SNP), using IMUs and optical motion capture (OMC) simultaneously. Participants performed six gait trials. Fifteen TSP and 28 kinematic angles were extracted. Intraclass correlations (ICC), root-mean-square error (RMSE), mean absolute percentage error and Bland-Altman analyses were used to assess concurrent validity of the IMU system (relative to OMC) separately in PLHIV and SNP. IMU reliability was assessed during within-session retest of trials. ICCs were used to assess relative reliability. Standard error of measurement (SEM) and percentage SEM were used to assess absolute reliability. RESULTS: Between-system TSP differences demonstrated acceptable-to-excellent ICCs (0.71-0.99), except for double support time and temporophasic parameters (< 0.60). All TSP demonstrated good mean absolute percentage errors (&#8804;7.40%). For kinematics, ICCs were acceptable to excellent (0.75-1.00) for all but three range of motion (ROM) and four discrete angles. RMSE and bias were 0.0°-4.7° for all but two ROM and 10 discrete angles. In both groups, TSP reliability was acceptable to excellent for relative (ICC 0.75-0.99) (except for one temporal and two temporophasic parameters) and absolute (%SEM 1.58-15.23) values. Reliability trends of IMU-measured kinematics were similar between groups and demonstrated acceptable-to-excellent relative reliability (ICC 0.76-0.99) and clinically acceptable absolute reliability (SEM 0.7°-4.4°) for all but two and three discrete angles, respectively. Both systems demonstrated similar magnitude and directional trends for differences when comparing the gait of PLHIV with that of SNP. CONCLUSIONS: IMU-based gait analysis is valid and reliable when applied in PLHIV; demonstrating a sufficiently low precision error to be used for clinical interpretation (< 5° for most kinematics; < 20% for TSP). IMU-based gait analysis is sensitive to subtle gait deviations that may occur in PLHIV.","Berner, Karina; Cockcroft, John; Louw, Quinette",Biomed Eng Online,,402

However, concerns exist regarding the long-term adverse effects cocooning may have on their physical and mental health. AIM: To examine health trajectories and healthcare utilization while cocooning in a cohort of community-dwelling people aged &#8805;70 years. DESIGN: Survey of 150 patients (55% female, mean age 80 years, mean Clinical Frailty Scale Score 4.8) attending ambulatory medical services in a large urban university hospital. METHODS: The survey covered four broad themes: access to healthcare services, mental health, physical health and attitudes to COVID-19 restrictions. Survey data was presented descriptively. RESULTS: Almost 40% (59/150) reported that their mental health was 'worse' or 'much worse' while cocooning, while over 40% (63/150) reported a decline in their physical health. Almost 70% (104/150) reported exercising less frequently or not exercising at all.Over 57% (86/150) of participants reported loneliness with 1 in 8 (19/150) reporting that they were lonely 'very often'.

417036,Impact of Pneumonia in Heart Failure Patients,2021,"INTRODUCTION: The need to rapidly implement telehealth at large scale during the COVID-19 pandemic led to many patients using telehealth for the first time. We assessed the effect of structured pre-visit preparatory telephone calls on success of telehealth visits and examined risk factors for unsuccessful visits. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was carried out of 45,803 adult patients scheduled for a total of 64,447 telehealth appointments between March and July 2020 at an academic medical center. A subset of patients received a structured pre-visit phone call. Demographic factors and inclusion of a pre-visit call were analysed by logistic regression. Primary outcomes were non-completion of any visit and completion of phone-only versus audio-visual telehealth visits. RESULTS: A pre-visit telephone call to a subset of patients significantly increased the likelihood of a successful telehealth visit (OR 0.54; 95% CI: 0.48-0.60). Patients aged 18-30 years, those with non-commercial insurance or those of Black race were more likely to have incomplete visits. Compared to age 18-30, increasing age increased likelihood of a failed video visit: 31-50 years (OR 1.31; 95% CI: 1.13-1.51), 51-70 years (OR 2.98; 2.60-3.42) and >70 years (OR 4.16; 3.58-4.82). Those with non-commercial insurance and those of Black race (OR 1.8; 95% CI 1.67-1.92) were more likely to have a failed video visit. DISCUSSION: A structured pre-call to patients improved the likelihood of a successful video visit during widespread adoption of telehealth. Structured pre-calls to patients may be an important tool to help reduce gaps in utilization among groups.","Gusdorf, Roman E; Shah, Kaustav P; Triana, Austin J; McCoy, Allison B; Pabla, Baldeep; Scoville, Elizabeth; Dalal, Robin; Beaulieu, Dawn B; Schwartz, David A; Horst, Sara N; Griffith, Michelle L",J Telemed Telecare,,402

Methods: The active compounds of TRQI were searched by literature, BATMAN-TCM, and TCMSP database. The potential targets of TRQI active compounds were searched by TCMSP. In Genecards database, “coronavirus” was used as the key word to search for coronavirus targets and the common targets were selected by mapping with TRQI. The network between the active compounds and common targets was established by Cytoscape 3.2.1. The common targets were imported into a STRING database for protein-protein interaction analysis, and the target protein interaction network diagram (PPI) was constructed. The key antiviral targets of TRQI were screened by combining two networks. “GlueGO 2.5.5” plug-in unit in Cytoscape 3.2.1 was used to perform GO biological process and KEGG pathway enrichment analysis. Results: A total of 54 components of TRQI were obtained and corresponding to 287 targets. Among them, there were 54 common targets and 34 key targets. GO analysis obtained 29 biological processes related to the treatment effect of TRQI, and KEGG analysis obtained 70 pathways. The results of molecular docking showed that kaempferol, quercetin, baicalein luteolin, and wogonin had good affinity with SARS-CoV-2 3CL hydrolase. Conclusion: The active compounds in TRQI may act as an antiviral agent by binding SARS-CoV-2 3CL hydrolase and regulating multiple signaling pathways. The molecular mechanism of TRQI in the treatment of COVID-19 indicated the synergistic features of multi-component, multi-target, and multi-pathway of traditional Chinese medicine, which provided an important scientific basis for further elucidating the mechanism of TRQI in the treatment of COVID-19.","Kong, Yi; Wu, Hong-Wei; Chen, Yong; Lai, Sha; Yang, Ze-Min; Chen, Ji-Sheng",Chin.

422034,Pulmonary Embolism Prophylaxis in Patients With COVID-19: An Emerging Issue,2021,"Acute kidney injury (AKI) is associated with high mortality in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). However, it is unclear whether patients with COVID-19 with hospital-acquired AKI (HA-AKI) and community-acquired AKI (CA-AKI) differ in disease course and outcomes. This study investigated the clinical profiles of HA-AKI, CA-AKI, and no AKI in patients with COVID-19 at a large tertiary care hospital in the New York City area. The incidence of HA-AKI was 23.26%, and CA-AKI was 22.28%. Patients who developed HA-AKI were older and had more comorbidities compared to those with CA-AKI and those with no AKI (p &lt; 0.05). A higher prevalence of coronary artery disease, heart failure, and chronic kidney disease was observed in those with HA-AKI compared to those with CA-AKI (p &lt; 0.05). Patients with CA-AKI received more invasive and non-invasive mechanical ventilation, anticoagulants, and steroids compared to those with HA-AKI (p &lt; 0.05), but patients with HA-AKI had significantly higher mortality compared to those with CA-AKI after adjusting for demographics and clinical comorbidities (adjusted odds ratio = 1.61, 95% confidence interval = 1.1-2.35, p &lt; 0.014). In addition, those with HA-AKI had higher markers of inflammation and more liver injury (p &lt; 0.05) compared to those with CA-AKI. These results suggest that HA-AKI is likely part of systemic multiorgan damage and that kidney injury contributes to worse outcomes. These findings provide insights that could lead to better management of COVID-19 patients in time-sensitive and potentially resource-constrained environments.","Lu, J. Y.; Babatsikos, I.; Fisher, M.

422729,Early mobilization and physical exercise in patients with COVID-19: A narrative literature review,2021,"The association between changes in public sentiment induced by COVID-19 and green consumption behavior has not been studied deeply. This study proposes that the awe induced by the COVID-19 pandemic can have both negative and positive aspects, aiming to psychologically reveal why the pandemic is affecting green consumer behavior and explore potential pathways for differentiation. Research data were derived from Wuhan, China, and analyzed using experimental method. This study finds that awe of COVID-19 positively affects green consumption behavior. Specifically, due to fear, anxiety, and powerlessness, individuals with negative awe of COVID-19 instinctively need to respond to risk and pay more attention to their own safety and interests, so as to promote green consumption. However, positive awe of COVID-19 involves higher levels of cognition, such as admiration, inspiration, and optimism. It inspires a commitment to prioritize nature and social groups, and promotes green consumption behavior. As conclusions, different types of awe can be induced from public health emergencies like COVID-19 and have their own specific paths to effect green consumption behavior. These findings could help governments and marketers build future policies and strategies to reasonably guide public sentiment in order to better promote green consumption in this epidemic.","Sun, Xixiang; Su, Weihuan; Guo, Xiaodong; Tian, Ziyuan",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,402

Hence, the restoration and protection of catalase is a promising therapeutic strategy in disease management. In the present study, for the first time we have demonstrated the protective role of well-known anti-malarial drug Artemisinin (ART) on the time and temperature-induced degradation of bovine liver catalase (BLC) activity. The findings at different time intervals and at higher temperature showed the protective role of ART on BLC activity. Molecular docking studies suggested specific binding of ART on BLC through heme group interface which was further supported by cyclic voltammetry and dynamic light scattering study. The stabilization of BLC in presence of ART was mediated through forming a BLC-ART complex with reduced and shifted electrochemical peak and increased hydrodynamic diameter. ART substantially prevents the temperature-induced reduction in &#945;-helical content with simultaneous increment in other secondary structures like antiparallel, parallel, ß-turn and random coils. Nevertheless, the protective role of ART was accepted from the enhanced thermal stability and increased Tm value of BLC in presence of ART at higher temperatures. Our results uncover the mechanism of interaction between ART with BLC and suggest the protective role of ART towards spatiotemporal alteration of BLC by preventing the structural and molecular change in BLC. Thus, the findings advocate ART as a potential therapeutic drug for diseases associated with reduced catalase activity.","Samal, Rashmi R; Kumari, Kanchan; Sahoo, Yashaswinee; Mishra, Sandip K; Subudhi, Umakanta",Int J Biol Macromol,,402

This study aimed to compare the disinfecting effect of HYP and surfactant using adenosine triphosphate (ATP) swab testing on large-scale equipment and facilities that could not be disassembled and disinfected in hospital kitchen. From May 2018 to July 2018, ATP swab tests were performed on the following six locations in the Shizuoka Cancer Centre Dietary Department Kitchen: cooking counter, mobile cooking counter, refrigerator handle, conveyor belt, tap handle, and sink. Six relative light unit (RLU) measurements were taken from each location. The log10 values of the RLU measurements were evaluated by dividing the samples into two groups: the control group (surfactant followed by HYP swabbing) and the HYP group (HYP swabbing only). The results showed that the RLUs (log10 values) in both the groups improved after disinfection (p<0.05), except for the RLUs (log10 values) of the mobile cooking counter, tap handle, and sink in the control group after the HYP swab. The changes in the RLU (log10 value) did not differ between the two groups for all locations of the kitchen. Hence, HYP swabbing of large-scale equipment and facilities provides the same level of disinfection as surfactants and can be as beneficial.","Aoyama, Takashi; Kudo, Tomoko",PLoS One,,402

Our model simulates the behavior of each individual in a population according to a probabilistic model through an inverse problem; we estimate the real number of recovered and infected people using mortality records. In addition, the model is dynamic in the sense that it takes into account the policy measures introduced when we solve the inverse problem. The results obtained in Spain have particular practical relevance: the number of infected individuals can be $17$ times higher than the data provided by the Spanish government on April $26$ $th$ in the worst-case scenario. Assuming that the number of fatalities reflected in the statistics is correct, $9.8$ percent of the population may be contaminated or have already been recovered from the virus in Madrid, one of the most affected regions in Spain. However, if we assume that the number of fatalities is twice as high as the official numbers, the number of infections could have reached $19.5\%$. In Galicia, one of the regions where the effect has been the least, the number of infections does not reach $2.5 \%$ . Based on our findings, we can: i) estimate the risk of a new outbreak before Autumn if we lift the quarantine; ii) may know the degree of immunization of the population in each region; and iii) forecast or simulate the effect of the policies to be introduced in the future based on the number of infected or recovered individuals in the population.","Matabuena, Marcos; Meijide-Garc'ia, Carlos; Rodr'iguez-Mier, Pablo; Lebor'an, V'ictor",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.13695v2.pdf,402

Therefore, this study aims to provide early independent evidence on the vaccine SEs’ prevalence and their potential risk factors;a cross-sectional survey-based study was carried out between February and March 2021 in Germany and Czech Republic among healthcare workers who recently received the AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine. The study used a validated self-administered questionnaire composed of twenty-eight multiple-choice items covering demographic variables, medical anamneses, and local, systemic, oral, and skin related SEs of the vaccine. Out of the ninety-two included participants, 77.2% were females and 79.3% were from Germany. Their mean age was 35.37 ± 12.62 (19–64) years-old, 15.2% had chronic illnesses and 22.8% were receiving medical treatments. Overall, 94.6% of the participants reported at least one SE. The most common local SE was injection site pain (72.8%), and the most common systemic SEs were fatigue (73.9%), muscle pain (55.4%), chills (48.9%), feeling unwell (46.7%), nausea (45.7%), and headache (29.3%). The vast majority (91.9%) resolved within 1–3 days, and the below 35 years-old group was the least affected age group. The SEs’ frequency was insignificantly higher in females and previously infected participants;the vaccine safety for the elderly was supported by the early findings of this study. Chronic illnesses and medical treatments were not associated with an increased risk of SE incidence and frequency. No blood disorder SEs were reported in our sample. Further independent studies are highly required to evaluate the safety of the AstraZeneca vaccine and to explore whether gender or previous infection could be associated with the vaccine SEs.","Riad, Abanoub Pokorná Andrea Mekhemar Mohamed Conrad Jonas Klugarová Jitka Koščík Michal Klugar Miloslav Attia Sameh",Vaccines,,402

In a short time, the health emergency became a global pandemic. To date, there are about 18.8 million infected people and about 700,000 deaths. There are currently no effective vaccines, and treatments are mostly experimental. The symptoms associated with COVID-19 are different, ranging from mild upper respiratory tract symptoms to severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (SARS). Data from previous coronavirus outbreaks such as SARS-CoV (2003 outbreak) and emerging epidemiological data from the current global COVID-19 pandemic suggest that there could be substantial tissue fibrotic consequences following SARS-CoV-2 infection, responsible for severe and in some cases fatal lung lesions. Some data show that even patients cured of viral infection have lung fibrotic tissue residues responsible for incorrect respiratory function even after healing. The role of antifibrotic drug therapy in patients with ongoing SARS-CoV-2 infection or in patients cured of residual pulmonary fibrosis is still to be defined and unclear; the scientific rationale for initiating, continuing, or discontinuing therapy is poorly defined.

In addition to its acute respiratory manifestations, SARS-CoV-2 may also adversely affect other organ systems. To date, however, there is a very limited understanding of the extent and management of COVID-19-related conditions outside of the pulmonary system. This narrative review provides an overview of the current literature about the extrapulmonary manifestations of COVID-19 that may affect the urinary, cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, hematological, hematopoietic, neurological, or reproductive systems. This review also describes the current understanding of the extrapulmonary complications caused by COVID-19 to improve the management and prognosis of patients with COVID-19.","Zheng, Kenneth I; Feng, Gong; Liu, Wen-Yue; Targher, Giovanni; Byrne, Christopher D; Zheng, Ming-Hua",J Med Virol,,402

The aim of this study was to ascertain the likelihood of finding LU abnormalities; mimicking lung involvement; in COVID-19 negative healthy individuals. METHODS: We performed LU on 265 healthcare workers; not presenting COVID-19 major symptoms and in good health; during the course of a serological screening program for COVID-19 in our General Hospital. LU results were reported as total Lung Ultrasound Score (LUS) using a 12-zone method of reporting. RESULTS: 250/265 subjects were included in the COVID-19 negative group. LU was not completely normal (LUS &#8800; 0) in 65/250 COVID-19 negative subjects (26%) and in 12/15 (80%) poorly symptomatic COVID-19 positive subjects; with a multifocal pattern in 12.7% vs. 66.7% of cases respectively. Age and COVID-19 positivity were independent predictors of total LUS. A total LUS &#8805; 2 had a sensitivity of 66.67% and a specificity of 85.60% in detecting COVID-19 positivity. CONCLUSIONS: A slightly altered LU can be quite frequent in healthy COVID-19 negative subjects. LU can have a role in confirming but not screening COVID-19 poorly symptomatic cases.,"Raiteri, Alberto; Alvisi, Margherita; Serio, Ilaria; Stefanini, Federico; Tovoli, Francesco; Piscaglia, Fabio",,,402

This study evaluated the pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and cardiac safety of nolasiban in 45 healthy women of child-bearing age. Nolasiban was administered in a fasted state with a standardised lunch served 4.5 h post-dose. Concentration-effect modelling was used to assess the effect of two dosages of nolasiban (900 mg and 1800 mg) on QTc following single-dose administration. We found no significant change in QTc at all tested dosages. Two-sided 90% confidence intervals of geometric mean Cmax for estimated QTc effects of nolasiban were below the threshold of regulatory concern. The sensitivity of the assay to detect small changes in QTc was confirmed by a significant shortening of QTc between 2 and 4 h after consumption of a meal, which served to validate the model. Independent of the nolasiban assessment, this study also explored the effects of sex hormones on ECG parameters, especially QT subintervals. We found a significant relationship between JTpc and oestradiol. Heart rate was negatively correlated with progesterone. This study confirms the cardiovascular safety of nolasiban and describes relationships of sex hormones and ECG parameters.","Täubel, Jörg; Lorch, Ulrike; Spencer, Christopher S; Freier, Anne; Camilleri, Dorothée; Djumanov, Dilshat; Ferber, Georg; Marchand, Line; Gotteland, Jean-Pierre; Pohl, Oliver",Sci Rep,,402
440518,Cerebral venous thrombosis in a young patient with COVID-19,2021,"The novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a major worldwide public health emergency that has infected over 8 million people. Spike glycoprotein, especially the partially open state of S1 subunit, in SARS-CoV-2 is considered vital for its infection with human host cell. However, the mechanism elucidating the transition from the closed state to the partially open state still remains unclear. In this study, we applied a series of computational methods, including Markov state model, transition path theory and random forest to analyze the S1 motion. Our results showed a promising complete conformational movement of the receptor-binding domain, from buried, partially open, to detached states. We also estimated the transition probability among these states. Based on the asymmetry in both the dynamics behavior and the accumulated alpha carbon (C&#945;) importance, we further suggested a relation among chains in the trimer spike protein, which leads to a deeper understanding on protein motions of the S1 subunit.

442869,Fellowship Training in Adult Cardiothoracic Anesthesiology: Navigating the New Educational Landscape as a Result of the Coronavirus Crisis,2020,"BACKGROUND: Infectious diseases and vaccines can occasionally cause new-onset or flare of immune-mediated diseases (IMDs). The adjuvanticity of the available SARS-CoV-2 vaccines is based on either TLR-7/8 or TLR-9 agonism, which is distinct from previous vaccines and is a common pathogenic mechanism in IMDs. METHODS: We evaluated IMD flares or new disease onset within 28-days of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination at five large tertiary centres in countries with early vaccination adoption, three in Israel, one in UK, and one in USA. We assessed the pattern of disease expression in terms of autoimmune, autoinflammatory, or mixed disease phenotype and organ system affected. We also evaluated outcomes. FINDINGS: 27 cases included 17 flares and 10 new onset IMDs. 23/27 received the BNT - 162b2 vaccine, 2/27 the mRNA-1273 and 2/27 the ChAdOx1 vaccines. The mean age was 54.4 +/- 19.2 years and 55% of cases were female. Among the 27 cases, 21 (78%) had at least one underlying autoimmune/rheumatic disease prior the vaccination. Among those patients with a flare or activation, four episodes occurred after receiving the second-dose and in one patient they occurred both after the first and the second-dose. In those patients with a new onset disease, two occurred after the second-dose and in one patient occurred both after the first (new onset) and second-dose (flare). For either dose, IMDs occurred on average 4 days later. Of the cases, 20/27 (75%) were mild to moderate in severity. Over 80% of cases had excellent resolution of inflammatory features, mostly with the use of corticosteroid therapy. Other immune-mediated conditions included idiopathic pericarditis (n = 2), neurosarcoidosis with small fiber neuropathy (n = 1), demyelination (n = 1), and myasthenia gravis (n = 2). In 22 cases (81.5%), the insurgence of Adverse event following immunization (AEFI)/IMD could not be explained based on the drug received by the patient. In 23 cases (85.2%), AEFI development could not be explained based on the underlying disease/co-morbidities. Only in one case (3.7%), the timing window of the insurgence of the side effect was considered not compatible with the time from vaccine to flare. INTERPRETATION: Despite the high population exposure in the regions served by these centers, IMDs flares or onset temporally-associated with SARS-CoV-2 vaccination appear rare. Most are moderate in severity and responsive to therapy although some severe flares occurred. FUNDING: none.","Watad, A.; De Marco, G.; Mahajna, H.; Druyan, A.; Eltity, M.; Hijazi, N.; Haddad, A.; Elias, M.; Zisman, D.; Naffaa, M.

COVID-19 is associated with a spectrum of respiratory symptoms, especially dyspnea. Patients who progress to severe or critical condition display peripheral and posterior lung lesions bilaterally. These patients require admission to the intensive care unit (ICU); therefore, they are prone to ICU-related complications during disease and after recovery. Respiratory physiotherapy techniques, in particular, active techniques, might help the improvement of airway clearance and lung capacity in addition to the reduction of breathing effort during the active disease. In parallel, it might lead to the prevention of disabilities, resulting from infection and extended hospitalization in patients who recovered from COVID-19. This supports physiotherapy both as a prophylactic and therapeutic strategy for COVID-19.","Shakerian, Narges; Mofateh, Razieh; Saghazadeh, Amene; Rezaei, Niloofar; Rezaei, Nima",Acta Biomed,,402

This study aims at comparatively analyzing COVID-19's effect on cancer care from both patient and provider perspectives. METHODS: A multi-institutional survey was developed to assess COVID-19-specific concerns regarding treatment, safety, and emotional stress through 5-point Likert-type prompts and open-ended questions before and during the pandemic. Wilcoxon signed-rank and rank-sum tests were used to analyze before/during answers for providers and patients independently. Open-ended responses were assessed using inductive thematic analysis. RESULTS: The survey was completed by 104 (69.3%) patients and 50 (50%) providers. Patients demonstrated a significant change in only 1 of 15 Likert prompts. Most significant were increased concern regarding susceptibility to infection [z = 2.536, p = 0.011] and concerns regarding their cancer outcome [z = 4.572, p < 0.001]. Non-physician providers demonstrated significant change in 8 of 13 Likert prompts, whereas physicians had all 13 Likert prompts change in the COVID-19 setting. Physicians believed care to be more poorly planned [z = -3.857, p &#8804; 0.001], availability of protective personal equipment to be more limited [z = -4.082, p < 0.001], and were significantly concerned infecting family members [z = 4.965, p < 0.001]. CONCLUSIONS: While patients had more difficulty coping with their cancer, they did not perceive significant differences in their actual treatment. This suggests the need for a renewed focus on patients coping with cancer. Among providers, physicians more than any other provider group had a strong negative perception of COVID-19's impact on healthcare, suggesting the need for novel approaches to target physician burnout.","Salehi, Omid; Alarcon, Sylvia V; Vega, Eduardo A; Kutlu, Onur C; Kozyreva, Olga; Chan, Jennifer A; Kazakova, Vera; Harz, Dominique; Conrad, Claudius",J. gastrointest. surg,,402

There are studies demonstrating that the Brazilian ginseng (BGE) possibly increases the serum levels of testosterone and nitric oxide in mice and rats. The present study aimed to evaluate the effects of its extract on male fertility and sperm quality. Male Swiss mice (n = 60) were divided into six groups. The control animals were provided 0.5 mL of water, and 0.5 mL of water containing 7 mg/kg per day (d) sildenafil citrate. Other animals were treated with BGE at 100 mg/kg/d, 200 mg/kg/d, and 400 mg/kg/d by gavage for 42 days. Finally, animals from the last group received 200 mg/kg BGE every 3 days (3-3d) by gavage for 42 days. The results showed a reduction in the number of resistant spermatids in the testis and damage to daily sperm production, culminating in a reduction in the number of epididymal spermatozoa. Although the sperm quality decreased in all experimental animals, only males treated with BGE 100 mg/kg/d showed pre and post implantation embryo losses. We concluded that BGE alters sperm viability compromising the embryonic development after implantation.","Dias, F C R; Machado-Neves, M; Lima, G D A; Martins, A L P; Menezes, T P; Melo, F C S A; Gomes, M L M; Cupertino, M C; Otoni, W C; Matta, S L P",Histol Histopathol,,402

Several studies have been undertaken in an attempt to minimize the impact of the disease worldwide. Although new knowledge has been quickly disseminated, including viral mechanisms, pathophysiology, and clinical findings, there is a lack of information on the effective pharmacological management of this disease. In vitro studies have shown some benefits related to the use of antimalarials (chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine) for inhibiting SARS-CoV-2. However, the data from open clinical trials on COVID-19 patients are controversial. OBJECTIVE: We present the protocol for a research project that compares the potential protective effect of antimalarials in preventing moderate-to-severe forms of COVID-19 in two groups: (1) patients treated chronically with antimalarials for rheumatic diseases and (2) other members of the patients' household who have not been diagnosed with rheumatic diseases and are not taking antimalarials. METHODS: This is a 24-week, prospective, observational cohort study comprising patients from public and private health services across Brazil, who chronically use antimalarials for the treatment of immune-mediated rheumatic diseases, osteoarthritis, or chikungunya-related arthropathy. A total of six sequential phone interviews were scheduled during the COVID-19 outbreak in five different regions of Brazil. Information regarding social, epidemiological, and demographic data, as well as details about rheumatic diseases, antimalarials, comorbidities, and concomitant medication, is being recorded using a specific online form in the REDCap database. Symptoms suggestive of COVID-19, including fever, cough, dyspnea, anosmia, and dysgeusia, are being self-reported and collected via phone interviews.

The forward problem of solving random differential equations with delay has received increasing attention in recent years. Motivated by the challenge to predict the COVID-19 caseload trajectories for individual states in the U.S., we target here the inverse problem. Given a sample of observed random trajectories obeying an unknown random differential equation model with delay, we use a functional data analysis framework to learn the model parameters that govern the underlying dynamics from the data. We show existence and uniqueness of the analytical solutions of the population delay random differential equation model when one has discrete time delays in the functional concurrent regression model and also for a second scenario where one has a delay continuum or distributed delay. The latter involves a functional linear regression model with history index. The derivative of the process of interest is modeled using the process itself as predictor and also other functional predictors with predictor-specific delayed impacts. This dynamics learning approach is shown to be well suited to model the growth rate of COVID-19 for the states that are part of the U.S., by pooling information from the individual states, using the case process and concurrently observed economic and mobility data as predictors.","Dubey, Paromita; Chen, Yaqing; Gajardo, 'Alvaro; Bhattacharjee, Satarupa; Carroll, Cody; Zhou, Yidong; Chen, Han; Muller, Hans-Georg",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2109.07059v1.pdf,402

447870,Bleeding and Bleeding Risk in COVID-19,2020,"BACKGROUND: COVID-19 pandemic has impacted the Italian National Health Care system at many different levels, causing a complete reorganization of surgical wards. In this context, our study retrospectively analysed the management strategy for patients with acute cholecystitis. METHODS: We analysed all patients admitted to our Emergency Department for acute cholecystitis between February and April 2020 and we graded each case according to 2018 Tokyo Guidelines. All patients were tested for positivity to SARS-CoV-2 and received an initial conservative treatment. We focused on patients submitted to cholecystostomy during the acute phase of pandemic and their subsequent disease evolution. RESULTS: Thirty-seven patients were admitted for acute cholecystitis (13 grade I, 16 grade II, 8 grade III). According to Tokyo Guidelines (2018), patients were successfully treated with antibiotic only, bedside percutaneous transhepatic gallbladder drainage (PC) and laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC) in 29.7%, 21.6% and 48.7% of cases respectively. Therapeutic strategy of three out of 8 cases, otherwise fit for surgery, submitted to bedside percutaneous transhepatic gallbladder drainage (37.5%), were directly modified by COVID-19 pandemic: one due to the SARS-CoV-2 positivity, while two others due to unavailability of operating room and intensive care unit for post-operative monitoring respectively. Overall success rate of percutaneous cholecystostomy was of 87.5%. The mean post-procedural hospitalization length was 9 days, and no related adverse events were observed apart from transient parietal bleeding, conservatively treated. Once discharged, two patients required readmission because of acute biliary symptoms. Median time of drainage removal was 43 days and only 50% patients thereafter underwent cholecystectomy. CONCLUSIONS: Percutaneous cholecystostomy has shown to be an effective and safe treatment thus acquiring an increased relevance in the first phase of the pandemic. Nowadays, considering we are forced to live with the SARS-CoV-2 virus, PC should be considered as a virtuous, alternative tool for potentially all COVID-19 positive patients and selectively for negative cases unresponsive to conservative therapy and unfit for surgery.","Barabino, Matteo; Piccolo, Gaetano; Trizzino, Arianna; Fedele, Veronica; Ferrari, Carlo; Nicastro, Vincenzo; Pisani Ceretti, Andrea; De Nicola, Enrico; Mariani, Nicolò Maria; Giovenzana, Marco; Scifo, Giovanna; Mazza, Massimiliano; Vercelli, Ruggero; Santambrogio, Roberto; Luigiano, Carmelo; Opocher, Enrico",BMC Surg,,402

Here, we propose that mega regions – clusters of metropolitan regions like the Acela Corridor in the United States are more exposed to diseases earlier in pandemics. We review standard accounts for the benefits and costs of locating in such regions before arguing that pandemic risk is higher there on average. We test this mega region exposure theory with a study of the US urban system. Our results indicate that American mega regions have born the early brunt of the disease, and that three mega regions are hotspots. From this standpoint, the extent more than the intensity of New York's urbanization may be implicated in its COVID-19 experience. We conclude that early pandemic risk is a hitherto unrecognised diseconomy operating in mega regions.","Adler, Patrick; Florida, Richard; Hartt, Maxwell",Tijdschr. Econ. Soc. Geogr.,,402
449045,Bleeding risk in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 receiving intermediate- or therapeutic doses of thromboprophylaxis,2021,"Glycoproteins of enveloped viruses replicating in nonprimate mammalian cells carry &#945;-1,3-galactose (&#945;-Gal) glycans, and can bind to anti-Gal antibodies which are abundant in humans. The antibodies have protected humans and their ancestors for millions of years, because they inhibit replication of many kinds of microbes carrying &#945;Gal glycans and aid complements and macrophages to destroy them. Therefore, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) replicating in nonprimate mammalian cells (eg, PK-15 cells) carry &#945;Gal glycans and could be employed as a live vaccine for corona virus 2019 (COVID-19). The live vaccine safety could be further enhanced through intramuscular inoculation to bypass the fragile lungs, like the live unattenuated adenovirus vaccine safely used in US recruits for decades. Moreover, the immune complexes of SARS-CoV-2 and anti-Gal antibodies could enhance the efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines, live or inactivated, carrying &#945;-Gal glycans. Experiments are imperatively desired to examine these novel vaccine strategies which probably have the critical advantages for defeating the pandemic of COVID-19 and preventing other viral infectious diseases.","Chen, Ji-Ming",J. med. virol,,402

The aim of this study was the observation of the trend of changes in the level of cardiorespiratory endurance of young football players in a one-year cycle overlapping with the COVID-19 lockdown and an assessment of the impact of the training intervention during home confinement. The participants of the study were 24 young football players. We analysed the results of the study in a one-year training cycle (lockdown from 11 March 2020 to 6 May 2020). The cardiorespiratory endurance was measured using the Multistage 20 m Shuttle Run test-Beep Test. A repeated measures analysis of variance was used in the study. Detailed comparisons were made using Tukey's HSD test. Statistically significant differences were noted in endurance in a one year cycle: F(5.115) = 22.65; p < 0.001; partial Eta-squared = 0.50. An increase in the level of endurance by mean = 179.17 m, SD ± 189.87 m was noted between T1 and T6. After the break caused by the COVID-19 restrictions, a decrease in the level of cardiorespiratory endurance was noted. Only after two training mesocycles was a significant increase in the mean value noted compared to the period before the pandemic (p < 0.05). With the negative impact of restrictions in mind, coaches and physiotherapists should exercise caution when planning training, taking into consideration the level of physical activity during the pandemic.","Kalinowski, Pawel; Myszkowski, Jakub; Marynowicz, Jakub",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,402
450966,Incidence of New-Onset and Worsening Heart Failure Before and After the COVID-19 Epidemic Lockdown in Denmark: A Nationwide Cohort Study,2020,"The CoViD-19 pandemic has provided the opportunity for the health care's digital revolution with the unprecedented accelerated expansion of telehealth, telemedicine and other digital health tools. Several tools have been developed and launched at national and international level to face the emergency, including tools to perform online triage, symptoms checking, video visits and remote monitoring, and to conduct local and national epidemiological surveillance studies. Artificial intelligence-based tools have also been developed to diagnose cases of CoViD-19 or to identify patients at risk. Most of these technologies have been endorsed by medical societies such as the American Medical Association and the American Academy of Family Physicians which launched specific guidelines about their use. The growth in telemedicine services and in digital health technologies could not have occurred without important telehealth regulatory changes that have occurred in some countries aimed at promoting their use to face the CoViD-19 emergency, such as the deregulation of the use of video conferencing and video chat systems to carry out video visits, and the payment parity between telehealth and in clinic care. In order to decide whether to continue using these tools even after the pandemic is over, it could be useful to perform validation and efficacy studies of these tools to study their implications on the doctor-patient relationship, to understand if the new features can be integrated with the other technological tools already in use, and if they can improve clinical practice and quality of care.","Santoro, Eugenio",Recenti Prog Med,,402

451544,Managing the Adult Congenital Heart Disease Patient in the COVID-19 Pandemic-A New York Perspective,2020,"OBJECTIVE: Persistent somatic symptoms, such as pain and fatigue, have been referred to as somatization. Somatization is commonly associated with histories of trauma and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Although previous research has demonstrated that PTSD can predict somatic problems, there has been no examination of this at the level of PTSD symptom clusters and multidimensional assessment of somatic symptoms. We examined the association between the three International Classification of Disease (11th Edition) PTSD symptom clusters (reexperiencing in the here and now, avoidance, and sense of threat), measured in relation to the COVID-19 pandemic as the stressor, and somatic symptoms while statistically adjusting for confounding variables. METHODS: Participants were a nationally representative sample of 1041 adults from the general population of the Republic of Ireland. Physical health problems across the domains of pain, gastrointestinal, cardiopulmonary, and fatigue were assessed by the Patient Health Questionnaire, and PTSD symptoms were assessed using the International Trauma Questionnaire. RESULTS: Sense of threat was associated with the presence of pain (ß = 0.254), fatigue (ß = 0.332), gastrointestinal (ß = 0.234), and cardiovascular symptoms (ß = 0.239). Avoidance was associated with pain (ß = 0.347). Reexperiencing was not associated with any physical health variable. CONCLUSIONS: In the context of COVID-19, the sense of threat symptoms in PTSD is most strongly related to somatic problems. Findings suggest that interventions addressing sense of threat symptoms might provide relief from somatization.","Jowett, Sally; Shevlin, Mark; Hyland, Philip; Karatzias, Thanos",Psychosom Med,,402
451853,Clinical outcomes of patients with COVID-19 and HIV coinfection,2020,"OBJECTIVES: We evaluated the clinical, virological and safety outcomes of lopinavir/ritonavir, lopinavir/ritonavir-interferon (IFN)-ß-1a, hydroxychloroquine or remdesivir in comparison to standard of care (control) in coronavirus 2019 disease (COVID-19) inpatients requiring oxygen and/or ventilatory support. METHODS: We conducted a phase III multicentre, open-label, randomized 1:1:1:1:1, adaptive, controlled trial (DisCoVeRy), an add-on to the Solidarity trial (NCT04315948, EudraCT2020-000936-23). The primary outcome was the clinical status at day 15, measured by the WHO seven-point ordinal scale. Secondary outcomes included quantification of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in respiratory specimens and pharmacokinetic and safety analyses. We report the results for the lopinavir/ritonavir-containing arms and for the hydroxychloroquine arm, trials of which were stopped prematurely. RESULTS: The intention-to-treat population included 583 participants-lopinavir/ritonavir (n = 145), lopinavir/ritonavir-IFN-ß-1a (n = 145), hydroxychloroquine (n = 145), control (n = 148)-among whom 418 (71.7%) were male, the median age was 63 years (IQR 54-71), and 211 (36.2%) had a severe disease. The day-15 clinical status was not improved with the investigational treatments: lopinavir/ritonavir versus control, adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 0.83, (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.55-1.26, p 0.39), lopinavir/ritonavir-IFN-ß-1a versus control, aOR 0.69 (95%CI 0.45-1.04, p 0.08), and hydroxychloroquine versus control, aOR 0.93 (95%CI 0.62-1.41, p 0.75). No significant effect of investigational treatment was observed on SARS-CoV-2 clearance. Trough plasma concentrations of lopinavir and ritonavir were higher than those expected, while those of hydroxychloroquine were those expected with the dosing regimen. The occurrence of serious adverse events was significantly higher in participants allocated to the lopinavir/ritonavir-containing arms. CONCLUSION: In adults hospitalized for COVID-19, lopinavir/ritonavir, lopinavir/ritonavir-IFN-ß-1a and hydroxychloroquine improved neither the clinical status at day 15 nor SARS-CoV-2 clearance in respiratory tract specimens.","Ader, Florence; Peiffer-Smadja, Nathan; Poissy, Julien; Bouscambert-Duchamp, Maude; Belhadi, Drifa; Diallo, Alpha; Delmas, Christelle; Saillard, Juliette; Dechanet, Aline; Mercier, Noémie; Dupont, Axelle; Alfaiate, Toni; Lescure, François-Xavier; Raffi, François; Goehringer, François; Kimmoun, Antoine; Jaureguiberry, Stéphane; Reignier, Jean; Nseir, Saad; Danion, François; Clere-Jehl, Raphael; Bouiller, Kévin; Navellou, Jean-Christophe; Tolsma, Violaine; Cabié, André; Dubost, Clément; Courjon, Johan; Leroy, Sylvie; Mootien, Joy; Gaci, Rostane; Mourvillier, Bruno; Faure, Emmanuel; Pourcher, Valérie; Gallien, Sébastien; Launay, Odile; Lacombe, Karine; Lanoix, Jean-Philippe; Makinson, Alain; Martin-Blondel, Guillaume; Bouadma, Lila; Botelho-Nevers, Elisabeth; Gagneux-Brunon, Amandine; Epaulard, Olivier; Piroth, Lionel; Wallet, Florent; Richard, Jean-Christophe; Reuter, Jean; Staub, Thérèse; Lina, Bruno; Noret, Marion",Clin. microbiol. infect,,402
451940,The Impact of Immunosuppression and Autoimmune Disease on Severe Outcomes in Patients Hospitalized with COVID-19,2020,"Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the most common co-morbidity associated with COVID-19 and the fatality rate in COVID-19 patients with CVD is higher compared to other comorbidities, such as hypertension and diabetes. Preliminary data suggest that COVID-19 may also cause or worsen cardiac injury in infected patients through multiple mechanisms such as 'cytokine storm', endotheliosis, thrombosis, lymphocytopenia etc. Autopsies of COVID-19 patients reveal an infiltration of inflammatory mononuclear cells in the myocardium, confirming the role of the immune system in mediating cardiovascular damage in response to COVID-19 infection and also suggesting potential causal mechanisms for the development of new cardiac pathologies and/or exacerbation of underlying CVDs in infected patients. In this review, we discuss the potential underlying molecular mechanisms that drive COVID-19-mediated cardiac damage, as well as the short term and expected long-term cardiovascular ramifications of COVID-19 infection in patients.","Unudurthi, Sathya D; Luthra, Priya; Bose, Rajendran J C; McCarthy, Jason R; Kontaridis, Maria Irene",Life Sci,,402

The primary objective of this scoping review is to synthesize current research of the diagnostic accuracy of history, physical examination, routine laboratory tests, real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR), immunology tests, and computed tomography (CT) for the emergency department (ED) diagnosis of COVID-19. Secondary objectives included a synopsis of diagnostic biases likely with current COVID-19 research as well as corresponding implications of false-negative and false-positive results for clinicians and investigators. METHODS: A Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses-Scoping Review (PRISMA-ScR)-adherent synthesis of COVID-19 diagnostic accuracy through May 5, 2020, was conducted. The search strategy was designed by a medical librarian and included studies indexed by PubMed and Embase since January 2020. RESULTS: A total of 1,907 citations were screened for relevance. Patients without COVID-19 are rarely reported, so specificity and likelihood ratios were generally unavailable. Fever is the most common finding, while hyposmia and hypogeusia appear useful to rule in COVID-19. Cough is not consistently present. Lymphopenia is the mostly commonly reported laboratory abnormality and occurs in over 50% of COVID-19 patients. rRT-PCR is currently considered the COVID-19 criterion standard for most diagnostic studies, but a single test sensitivity ranges from 60% to 78%. Multiple reasons for false-negatives rRT-PCR exist, including sample site tested and disease stage during which sample was obtained. CT may increase COVID-19 sensitivity in conjunction with rRT-PCR, but guidelines for imaging patients most likely to benefit are emerging. IgM and IgG serology levels are undetectable in the first week of COVID-19, but sensitivity (range = 82% to 100%) and specificity (range = 87% to 100%) are promising. Whether detectable COVID-19 antibodies correspond to immunity remains unanswered. Current studies do not adhere to accepted diagnostic accuracy reporting standards and likely report significantly biased results if the same tests were to be applied to general ED populations with suspected COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: With the exception of fever and disorders of smell/taste, history and physical examination findings are unhelpful to distinguish COVID-19 from other infectious conditions that mimic SARS-CoV-2 like influenza. Routine laboratory tests are also nondiagnostic, although lymphopenia is a common finding and other abnormalities may predict severe disease. Although rRT-PCR is the current criterion standard, more inclusive consensus-based criteria will likely emerge because of the high false-negative rate of PCR tests. The role of serology and CT in ED assessments remains undefined.","Carpenter, Christopher R; Mudd, Philip A; West, Colin P; Wilber, Erin; Wilber, Scott T",Acad. emerg. med,,402

We investigated relationships between IS, AD, and outcomes in patients hospitalized with COVID-19. Data on consecutive admissions for COVID-19 were extracted retrospectively from medical records. Patients were assigned to one of four cohorts, according to whether or not they had an AD (AD and NAD) or were immunosuppressed (IS and NIS). The primary endpoint was development of severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS); secondary endpoints included death, and a composite of mechanical ventilation (MV) or death. A total of 789 patients were included: 569 (72.1%) male, 76 (9.6%) with an AD, and 63 (8.0%) with IS. Relative to the NIS-NAD cohort, patients in the IS-AD cohort had a significantly reduced risk of severe ARDS (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] 0.42; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.23-0.80; p = 0.008). No significant relationships between IS or AD status and either death or the composite of MV and death were identified, although a trend towards higher mortality was identified in the IS-NAD cohort (aHR vs NIS-NAD 1.71; 95% CI 0.94-3.12; p = 0.081). Patients in this cohort also had higher median serum levels of interleukin-6 compared with IS-AD patients (98.2 vs 21.6 pg/mL; p = 0.0328) and NIS-NAD patients (29.1 pg/mL; p = 0.0057).

This paper therefore aims to provide a comprehensive review of the current recommendations on the use of mouthwashes against the COVID-19 pandemic and to analyse the advantages and disadvantages of most conventional antiseptic mouthwashes used in dentistry.","Vergara-Buenaventura, A; Castro-Ruiz, C",Br J Oral Maxillofac Surg,,402

During the COVID-19 pandemic and beyond, advancement toward universal health coverage (UHC) will become more difficult for many countries, demonstrating that locally led priority setting is urgently needed to provide health services with appropriate financial protection to all. Because resources are limited and no national constituency can provide an unlimited number of services to their whole population in a sustainable manner, rationing and setting priorities for the selection of interventions to be included in a defined package of services is critical. In this Perspective, we discuss how packages of essential health services can be developed in resource-constrained settings, and detail how experts and the public can decide on principles and criteria, use a comprehensive array of analytical methods and choose which services to be provided free of charge. We illustrate these main steps while drawing on a recently conducted exercise of revising the national essential health services package in Ethiopia, which we compare with examples from other countries that have defined their essential benefits packages. This Perspective also provides recommendations for other low- and middle-income countries on their pathway to UHC.","Verguet, Stéphane; Hailu, Alemayehu; Eregata, Getachew Teshome; Memirie, Solomon Tessema; Johansson, Kjell Arne; Norheim, Ole Frithjof",Nat Med,,402

An Italian web survey helps us to understand where the doubts lie,2021,"COVID-19 put unprecedented external pressure on small businesses to adopt or increase use of social media while not all small businesses are internally ready for this rapid change. This study investigated the roles of external pressures and organizational culture of openness and learning in driving small retail business owners'/managers' social media use decisions by impacting their perceived usefulness and barriers, based on the innovation-decision process model from the diffusion of innovations theory and the theory of reasoned action. An online survey with structured measurements was administered to 411 U.S. small retail business owners/managers. Results from structural equation modeling revealed that external pressures positively influenced small business owners'/managers’ perceived usefulness and barriers and social media use intention. In addition, the culture of openness and learning positively influenced the perceived usefulness while mitigating the perceived barriers, thereby directly and indirectly influencing the social media use intention. Theoretical and managerial implications are discussed.","Kwon, Wi-Suk Woo Hongjoo Sadachar Amrut Huang Xiao",Journal of Retailing and Consumer Services,,402
458155,Coronavirus Disease-19 (COVID-19) and Heart Failure: Current Perspective,2020,"INTRODUCTION: The effect of SARS-CoV-2 infection in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) and the influence of disease-modifying therapies (DMT) for MS on COVID-19 are unknown. To date, patients with MS have not been shown to present greater risk of COVID-19 or more severe progression of the disease. METHODS: We performed a descriptive study of patients with MS presenting SARS-CoV-2 infection diagnosed with PCR. We analysed demographic, clinical, laboratory, and treatment variables in our sample. Presence of antibodies against the virus was also determined. RESULTS: Relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) was the most frequent form of MS in our sample. Prognosis was unfavourable in 10.2% of patients, and was associated with older age and higher scores on the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS). Seroprevalence of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 was 83.3% in our sample. Development of antibodies was not associated with DMT, lymphocytopaenia, or any of the other variables analysed. CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of COVID-19 was slightly lower in our sample than in the general population in our province. Unfavourable prognosis was associated with older age and higher EDSS scores. DMT and lymphocytopaenia did not influence the clinical course of COVID-19. Seroprevalence of antibodies against the virus in our sample was similar to that reported for the general population with positive PCR results for the virus; the influence of specific DMTs could not be determined.","Piñar Morales, R; Ramírez Rivas, M A; Barrero Hernández, F J","Neurologia (Barc., Ed. impr.)",,402
458408,"Barrier Devices, Intubation, and Aerosol Mitigation Strategies: PPE in the Time of COVID-19",2020,"Seed-mediated methods are widely used in industrial or academic laboratories for the synthesis of nanoparticles of controlled shape and size. In the natural medium, precipitation of secondary minerals also often take place on seeds. In this context, we have devised a formalism which accounts for the competition between seed growth and nucleation and growth of secondary particles in an initially over-saturated aqueous solution. Based on the classical nucleation theory, it involves a size-dependent growth law which accounts for Ostwald ripening effects, unlike most water-rock interaction codes. We find that, in such closed system, seed growth and nucleation/growth of secondary particles are strongly coupled. In the multi-dimensional parameter space, regions where one or the other process prevails are well-separated by a rather abrupt transition. In general, the value of the initial seed total surface area is insufficient to fully orientate the synthesis. Relying on this approach, we propose an alternative interpretation of recent experimental results on amorphous silica nanoparticle synthesis. Besides fundamental understanding of the kinetics of precipitation, the interest of the present approach is to serve as a guideline to experimentalists or industrialists working in seed-mediated syntheses and warn on the undesired formation of secondary particles when monodispersed distributions of nano- or micro-particles are searched.","Noguera, C; Fritz, B; Clément, A; Lemarchand, D",J Colloid Interface Sci,,402

However, at initial presentation, most patients' viral status is unknown. Determination of factors that predict initial and subsequent need for ICU and invasive mechanical ventilation is critical for resource planning and allocation. We describe our experience with 4,404 persons under investigation and explore predictors of ICU care and invasive mechanical ventilation at a New York COVID-19 epicenter. Methods: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of all persons under investigation and presenting to a large academic medical center emergency department (ED) in New York State with symptoms suggestive of COVID-19. The association between patient predictor variables and SARS-CoV-2 status, ICU admission, invasive mechanical ventilation, and mortality was explored with univariate and multivariate analyses. Results: Between March 12 and April 14, 2020, we treated 4,404 persons under investigation for COVID-19 infection, of whom 68% were discharged home, 29% were admitted to a regular floor, and 3% to an ICU. One thousand six hundred fifty-one of 3,369 patients tested have had SARS-CoV-2-positive results to date. Of patients with regular floor admissions, 13% were subsequently upgraded to the ICU after a median of 62 hours (interquartile range 28 to 106 hours). Fifty patients required invasive mechanical ventilation in the ED, 4 required out-of-hospital invasive mechanical ventilation, and another 167 subsequently required invasive mechanical ventilation in a median of 60 hours (interquartile range 26 to 99) hours after admission. Testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 and lower oxygen saturations were associated with need for ICU and invasive mechanical ventilation, and with death. High respiratory rates were associated with the need for ICU care. Conclusion: Persons under investigation for COVID-19 infection contribute significantly to the health care burden beyond those ruling in for SARS-CoV-2. For every 100 admitted persons under investigation, 9 will require ICU stay, invasive mechanical ventilation, or both on arrival and another 12 within 2 to 3 days of hospital admission, especially persons under investigation with lower oxygen saturations and positive SARS-CoV-2 swab results. This information should help hospitals manage the pandemic efficiently.","Singer, Adam J; Morley, Eric J; Meyers, Kristen; Fernandes, Rafael; Rowe, Alison L; Viccellio, Peter; Thode, Henry C; Bracey, Alexander; Henry, Mark C",Ann Emerg Med,,402

465363,A systematic review of pathological findings in COVID-19: a pathophysiological timeline and possible mechanisms of disease progression,2020,"Aim/objective/introduction: Cytokine storm or cytokine release syndrome (CRS) is inevitable in severe and critically ill patients with novel coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19). This review aimed to discuss current therapeutic options for the management of CRS in COVID-19. Background: Cytokine storm is caused by the colossal release of proinflammatory cytokines [e.g., IL (interleukin)-2, IL-6, IL-8 TNF (tumor necrosis factor)-α, etc.] causing dysregulated, hyperimmune response. This immunopathogenesis leads to acute lung injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Targeting cytokine storm with the therapies that are already available in India with the support of published guidelines and consensus can assist in achieving a better outcome in COVID-19. Review results: We predominantly included published guidelines or consensus recommendations about the management of cytokine storm in COVID-19. From the existing literature evidence, it is observed that among the currently available agents, low-dose corticosteroids and heparin can be beneficial in managing cytokine storm. The use of serine protease inhibitors such as ulinastatin has been advised by some experts. Though therapies such as high-dose vitamin C and interleukin-6 inhibitors (e.g., tocilizumab) have been advised, the evidence regarding their use for cytokine storm in COVID-19 is limited. Therapies such as Janus kinase inhibitors (JAK) inhibitors and Neurokinin-1 receptor (NK-1) antagonists are still in research. Besides, pharmaceutical treatments, use of blood purification strategies, and convalescent plasma may be life-saving options in some of the critically ill COVID-19 patients. For these therapies, there is a need to generate further evidence to substantiate their use in CRS management. Conclusion: Current management of COVID-19 is preventive and supportive. Different therapies can be used to prevent and treat the cytokine storm. More research is needed for further supporting the use of these treatments in COVID-19.","Mehta, Yatin; Dixit, Subhal B.; Zirpe, Kapil G.; Ansari, Abdul S.",Indian J. Crit. Care Med.,,402

465382,Recommendations for the clinical and laboratory diagnosis of VITT against COVID-19: Communication from the ISTH SSC Subcommittee on Platelet Immunology,2021,"Analysing the pandemic through a feminist political economy lens makes clear how gender, race, and class structures are crucial to the functioning of capitalism and to understanding the impacts of the pandemic. The way capital organises production and reproduction combines with structures of oppression, generating vulnerability among the racialised and gendered populations worst impacted by Covid-19. Using global data, this commentary shows that during the pandemic, women experienced relatively greater employment losses, were more likely to work in essential jobs, and experienced a greater reduction in income. Women were also doing more reproductive labour than men and were more likely to drop out of the labour force because of it. Analyses of capitalism in feminist political economy illustrate how capital accumulation depends on women's oppression in multiple, fundamental ways having to do with their paid and unpaid work. Women's work, and by extension their health, is the foundation upon which both production and social reproduction rely. Recognising the pandemic as endogenous to capitalism heightens the contradiction between a world shaped by the profit motive and the domestic and global requirements of public health.","Cohen, Jennifer; van der Meulen Rodgers, Yana",Glob Public Health,,402

466192,Diagnosis of venous and arterial thromboembolic events in COVID-19 virus-infected patients,2020,"Background: Post-traumatic stress symptoms can occur in patients with medical illness. During the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) outbreak in South Korea in 2015, some dialysis patients in three centers who were incidentally exposed to patients or medical staff with confirmed MERS-CoV infection were isolated to interrupt the spread of the infection. We aimed to investigate post-traumatic stress symptoms and risk factors among these patients. Materials and methods: In total, 116 hemodialysis (HD) patients in contact with MERS-CoV-confirmed subjects were isolated using three strategies, namely, single room isolation, cohort isolation, and self-quarantine. We used the Impact of Event Scale-Revised-Korean (IES-R-K) to examine post-traumatic stress symptoms at 12 months after the isolation period. Results: Of the 116 HD patients, 27 were lost to follow-up. Of the 89 patients, 67 (75.3%) completed the questionnaires. Single room isolation was used on 40 (58.8%) of the patients, cohort isolation on 20 (29.4%), and self-imposed quarantine on 8 (11.8%). In total, 17.9% of participants (n = 12) reported post-traumatic stress symptoms exceeding the IES-R-K's cutoff point (â‰§18). Prevalence rates of IES-R-K â‰§18 did not differ significantly according to isolation method. However, isolation duration was linearly associated with the IES-R-K score (standardized β coefficient-0.272, P = 0.026). Scores in Avoidance, Emotional numbing and Dissociation subscale were higher in patients with longer isolation period. Conclusion: MERS was a traumatic experience for quarantined HD patients. IES-R-K scores were not significantly different by isolation methods. However, short isolation was associated with post-traumatic stress symptoms.","Cho, A Jin; Lee, Hong-Seock; Lee, Young-Ki; Jeon, Hee Jung; Park, Hayne Cho; Jeong, Da-Wun; Kim, Yang-Gyun; Lee, Sang-Ho; Lee, Chang-Hee; Yoo, Kyung Don; Wong, Ae Kyeong",BioPsychoSocial Med.,,402
466393,"Analysis of Ovarian Injury Associated With COVID-19 Disease in Reproductive-Aged Women in Wuhan, China: An Observational Study",2021,"Background Consumption patterns of the people around the world have been tremendously affected due to the COVID-19 outbreak since December 2019. Previous studies validated the influence of both internal and external factors on consumer behaviour. However, due to the lack of empirical research, this study explored the influence of external factor such as COVID-19 on consumer purchase behaviour, economic and financial situation. In addition, the study investigated how crisis perception and consumption pattern vary due to demographic variables. Methods A convenience sampling technique was used and a total of 340 responses were collected from three countries, e.g., Bangladesh (n=129), India (n=122), and Pakistan (n=89) using a structured questionnaire. The respondents rated the items, collected from relevant past studies, on a 5 point Likert scale ranging from highly disagree to highly agree. Results Exploratory factor analysis (EFA) summarized all the measurement items into seven main factors from which two factors were deleted due to low reliability. Except for the individual’s financial situation, the overall mean value of the remaining factors was above 3.50 indicating the high level of crisis perception and greater change in consumption patterns. Multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) indicated that the factor scores were significantly different across countries, gender, education and income groups. In addition, Indian consumers were highly concerned and affected by COVID-19 followed by Pakistani and Bangladeshi consumers. In only one factor (e.g., an individual’s financial situation), country and age had a significant interaction effect. Finally, the factors had significant difference among three categories of consumers (e.g., low, medium and high crisis perception). It indicates that consumers who perceived crisis highly had been affected more than the others. Conclusions Therefore, more COVID-19 crisis perception leads to significant changes in consumption pattern and the financial situation of the consumers. This study had implications for academicians, marketers and decision-makers regarding effective design and implementation of business strategies.","Hasan, Shahedul Islam Md Amanul Bodrud-Doza Md",Heliyon,,402
466588,Lymphocyte Subset Counts in COVID-19 Patients: A Meta-Analysis,2020,"SARS-CoV-2 positive or seropositive owned cats have been reported worldwide. The detection of seropositive stray cats in the proximity of farms of infected minks, coupled with the demonstration of cat-to-cat transmission in experimental settings, raise the question whether stray cats may have an epidemiological role in the COVID-19 pandemic and may act as sentinel for the circulation of SARS-CoV-2. The aim of this study was to evaluate the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA and anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in free roaming cats belonging to colonies located in an area highly affected by the COVID-19 pandemic and to correlate the results with the positivity rate in people sharing the same area. Interdigital, cutaneous, oropharyngeal, nasal and rectal swabs, as well as blood samples, were collected from 99 cats living in colonies and admitted to our hospital for neutering. This caseload corresponds to the 24.2% of the feline population living in the 25 sampled colonies and to the 5.6% of all the free-roaming registered cats. The presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in swabs was assessed using real time RT-PCR. Anti-SARS-CoV-2 serum antibodies were assessed using commercially available ELISA kits and confirmed by serum virus neutralization. In people, the SARS-CoV-2 positivity rate ranged from 3.0% to 5.1% (mean rate: 4.1%) and the seropositive rate from 12.1% to 16.3% (mean rate: 14.2%). Most of the colonies were in urban areas and resident cats had frequent contacts with external cats or people. A COVID-19 positive caretaker was found, whereas all the cats were negative for SARS-CoV-2 RNA and seronegative. Although the negative results cannot exclude previous infections followed by decrease of antibodies, this study suggests that colony cats do not have an important epidemiological role in SARS-CoV-2 transmission dynamics. Further studies on larger caseloads are warranted, also in the light of the emerging new viral variants, on a One Health perspective.","Stranieri, Angelica; Lauzi, Stefania; Giordano, Alessia; Galimberti, Luigi; Ratti, Gabriele; Decaro, Nicola; Brioschi, Federica; Lelli, Davide; Gabba, Silvia; Amarachi, Ndiana Linda; Lorusso, Eleonora; Moreno, Ana; Trogu, Tiziana; Paltrinieri, Saverio",Transbound. emerg. dis.

The return of an abducted child to the country of his or her habitual residence is challenged by travel restrictions, international border closures, quarantine measures, but also by closed courts or cancelled hearings. Those new circumstances that befell the whole world underline two issues considering child abduction proceedings. The first one considers access to justice in terms of a mere possibility of the applicant to initiate the return proceeding and, where the procedure is initiated, in terms of the manner of conducting the procedure. The legislation requires a quick initiation and a summary resolution of child abduction proceedings, which is crucial to ensuring the best interests and well-being of a child. This includes the obligation of the court to hear both the child and the applicant. Secondly, it is to be expected that COVID-19 will be used as a reason for child abduction and increasingly as justification for issuing non-return orders seen as a ""grave risk"" to the child under Article 13(1)(b) of the Child Abduction Convention. By analysing court practice from the beginning of the pandemic in March 2020 to March 2021, the research will investigate how the pandemic has affected child abduction proceedings in Croatia. Available national practice of other contracting states will also be examined. The aim of the research is to evaluate whether there were obstacles in accessing the national competent authorities and courts during the COVID-19 pandemic, and in which manner the courts conducted the proceedings and interpreted the existence of the pandemic in the context of the grave risk of harm exception. The analyses of Croatian and other national practices will be used to gain an overall insight into the effectiveness of the emerging guidance and suggest their possible broadening in COVID-19 circumstances or any other future crises.","Drventić, Martina L.

In this study, we developed a method to search the basal SARS-CoV-2 clade among collected SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences. We first identified the mutation sites in the SARS-CoV-2 whole genome sequence alignment. Then by the pairwise comparison of the numbers of mutation sites among all SARS-CoV-2s, the least mutated clade was identified, which is the basal clade under parsimony principle. In our first analysis, we used 168 SARS-CoV-2 sequences (GISAID dataset till 2020/03/04) to identify the basal clade which contains 33 identical viral sequences from seven countries. To our surprise, in our second analysis with 367 SARS-CoV-2 sequences (GISAID dataset till 2020/03/17), the basal clade has 51 viral sequences, 18 more sequences added. The much larger NCBI dataset shows that this clade has expanded with 85 unique sequences by 2020/04/04. The expanding basal clade tells a chilling fact that the least mutated SARS-CoV-2 sequence was replicating and spreading for at least four months. It is known that coronaviruses have the RNA proofreading capability to ensure their genome replication fidelity. Interestingly, we found that the SARS-CoV-2 without its nonstructural proteins 13 to 16 (Nsp13-Nsp16) exhibits an unusually high mutation rate. Our result suggests that SARS-CoV-2 has an unprecedented RNA proofreading capability which can intactly preserve its genome even after a long period of transmission. Our selection analyses also indicate that the positive selection event enabling SARS-CoV-2 to cross species and adapt to human hosts might have been achieved before its outbreak.","Shen, Libing; Zhang, Zhao; He, Funan",Mol Phylogenet Evol,,402

We aimed to quantify the effect (if any) of the presence as opposed to absence of cancer on important clinical outcomes of patients with COVID-19 by carrying out a systematic review and meta-analysis. METHODS: We systematically searched PubMed, medRxiv, COVID-19 Open Research Dataset (CORD-19), and references of relevant articles up to April 27, 2020, to identify observational studies comparing patients with versus without cancer infected with COVID-19 and to report on mortality and/or need for admission to the intensive care unit (ICU). We calculated pooled risk ratios (RR) and 95% CIs with a random-effects model. The meta-analysis was registered with PROSPERO (CRD42020181531). RESULTS: A total of 32 studies involving 46,499 patients (1,776 patients with cancer) with COVID-19 from Asia, Europe, and the United States were included. All-cause mortality was higher in patients with versus those without cancer (2,034 deaths; RR, 1.66; 95% CI, 1.33 to 2.07; P < .0001; 8 studies with 37,807 patients). The need for ICU admission was also more likely in patients with versus without cancer (3,220 events; RR, 1.56; 95% CI, 1.31 to 1.87; P < .0001; 26 studies with 15,375 patients). However, in a prespecified subgroup analysis of patients > 65 years of age, all-cause mortality was comparable between those with versus without cancer (915 deaths; RR, 1.06; 95% CI, 0.79 to 1.41; P = .71; 8 studies with 5,438 patients). CONCLUSION: The synthesized evidence suggests that cancer is associated with worse clinical outcomes among patients with COVID-19. However, elderly patients with cancer may not be at increased risk of death when infected with COVID-19. These findings may inform discussions of clinicians with patients about prognosis and may guide health policies.","Giannakoulis, Vassilis G; Papoutsi, Eleni; Siempos, Ilias I",JCO Glob Oncol,,402

The current COVID-19 pandemic has affected almost every part of life and economy. Consequently, this study sets off to assess the effect of the pandemic on blood supply and blood transfusion in the University of Calabar Teaching Hospital. METHODS: Data from the Donor Clinic and Blood Group Serology Unit of the University of Calabar Teaching Hospital were retrospectively extracted to evaluate supply and use of blood before and during COVID-19 pandemic. RESULT: A total of 1638 donors were recorded within the study period. Age range 15-29 and 30-44 years constituted majority of the subjects (58.9% and 33.4%, respectively). The donor pool were male-dominated. Commercial donors (61.7%) and family replacement donors (30.6%) constituted majority of the donor pool. Most of the donor pool were students (37.1%), public servants (22.8%) and artisans (18.6%). A concomitant decrease of 26.1% and 18.9% were recorded in blood donation and request during the COVID-19 pandemic. CONCLUSION: Blood supply was not significantly affected in our study center as both requests and donations decreased. Consideration for improving family replacement donation was advised.","Ogar, C O; Okoroiwu, H U; Obeagu, E I; Etura, J E; Abunimye, D A",Transfus. clin. biol,,402

Bats in particular have been recognized as reservoirs to a large variety of viruses with the potential to cross-species transmission. In order to assess the risk of bats in Switzerland for such transmissions, we determined the virome of tissue and fecal samples of 14 native and 4 migrating bat species. In total, sequences belonging to 39 different virus families, 16 of which are known to infect vertebrates, were detected. Contigs of coronaviruses, adenoviruses, hepeviruses, rotaviruses A and H, and parvoviruses with potential zoonotic risk were characterized in more detail. Most interestingly, in a ground stool sample of a Vespertilio murinus colony an almost complete genome of a Middle East respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (MERS-CoV) was detected by Next generation sequencing and confirmed by PCR. In conclusion, bats in Switzerland naturally harbour many different viruses. Metagenomic analyses of non-invasive samples like ground stool may support effective surveillance and early detection of viral zoonoses.","Hardmeier, Isabelle; Aeberhard, Nadja; Qi, Weihong; Schoenbaechler, Katja; Kraettli, Hubert; Hatt, Jean-Michel; Fraefel, Cornel; Kubacki, Jakub",PLoS One,,402

Patients were divided into 2 groups based on the occurrence of adverse events during hospitalization. Heart and respiratory rate were monitored continuously and an automated EWS was calculated every 5 minutes. Data were compared between groups. RESULTS: Prior to the occurrence of adverse events, significantly higher median heart and respiration rate and significantly lower median SPO(2) values were observed. Mean and median automated EWS were significantly higher in patients with an adverse event. CONCLUSION: Continuous monitoring systems might help to detect clinical deterioration in COVID-19 patients at an earlier stage.","de Ree, R.; Willemsen, J.; Te Grotenhuis, G.; Kolkert, J.; Peppelman, M.",JAMIA Open,,402

477667,Arterial thrombotic complications in COVID-19 patients,2020,"BACKGROUND: In COVID-19 pandemics days, wearing facial mask in public places has become obligatory to prevent the virus spread. In addition to its valuable protection, wearing facial mask can affect verbal communication in an adverse fashion and makes mutual understanding difficult. This happens because the mask eliminates the positive effect of the lip-reading phenomenon in direct communications. The mirror neuron system is responsible for automatic imitation, associative sequence learning, and motor mimicry. This system is a strong candidate justifying an unexpected action described in this article. PURPOSE: Taking the facial mask off, to help the listener understanding better is a normal reaction. However, unexpectedly, one does the same as the listener when he/she is unable to comprehend the speaker. Herein, we suggest a hypothesis proposing the basic role of Mirror neuron system in this action. Most of the research on these cells have been conducted on monkeys, where the researchers observed that, these neuron discharge pulses both when a monkey performs an action and when it observes another monkey or a person committing the similar action. CONCLUSION: The driving mechanism of an unanticipated action of taking off mask while listening to a speaker is emphasized in this paper. Herein, we try to clarify how we came up with the idea that mirror neuron system drives a surprising action observed in COVID-19 pandemics days. As a result, we suggest possible clinical studies to verify our hypothesis.","Derakhshan, Nima; Yaghmaei, Shekoofeh",Eur. arch. oto-rhino-laryngol,,402
478253,Venous Thromboembolism in Hospitalized COVID-19 Patients,2020,"COVID‐19 emerged in Wuhan, China, and began its worldwide journey. As the severity of the virus became known, the Chinese National Government mobilized resources, and their centralized management was critical to the containment of the epidemic. Healthcare agencies and providers were overwhelmed with patients, many of whom were critically ill and died. Nurses adapted to the work using personal protective equipment, but its initial scarcity contributed to stressful working conditions. Nurses in the United States can take several lessons from the experiences of their Chinese nurse colleagues, including the benefit of centralized management of the epidemic, the need for specialized treatment facilities, and the importance of a national stockpile of critical equipment and supplies. A fully funded United States Department of Health and Human Services Office of Pandemics and Emerging Threats is necessary. A nursing department within the office and a national mobilization plan to send nurses to support local efforts during a pandemic or other threat are likewise essential. Continuous training for nurses, especially caring for patients with infectious diseases in intensive care units, stress management, and how to comfort the dying, are also useful lessons.","Anders, Robert L.; Lam, Simon C.",Nursing Forum,,402

Our purpose was to assess the prognostic value of serial electrocardiograms in COVID-19 patients. METHODS: We evaluated 269 consecutive patients admitted to our center with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. ECGs available at admission and after 1 week from hospitalization were assessed. We evaluated the correlation between ECGs findings and major adverse events (MAE) as the composite of intra-hospital all-cause mortality or need for invasive mechanical ventilation. Abnormal ECGs were defined if primary ST-T segment alterations, left ventricular hypertrophy, tachy or bradyarrhythmias and any new AV, bundle blocks or significant morphology alterations (e.g., new Q pathological waves) were present. RESULTS: Abnormal ECG at admission (106/216) and elevated baseline troponin values were more common in patients who developed MAE (p = .04 and p = .02, respectively). Concerning ECGs recorded after 7 days (159), abnormal findings were reported in 53.5% of patients and they were more frequent in those with MAE (p = .001). Among abnormal ECGs, ischemic alterations and left ventricular hypertrophy were significantly associated with a higher MAE rate. The multivariable analysis showed that the presence of abnormal ECG at 7 days of hospitalization was an independent predictor of MAE (HR 3.2; 95% CI 1.2-8.7; p = .02). Furthermore, patients with abnormal ECG at 7 days more often required transfer to the intensive care unit (p = .01) or renal replacement therapy (p = .04). CONCLUSIONS: Patients with COVID-19 should receive ECG at admission but also during their hospital stay. Indeed, electrocardiographic alterations during hospitalization are associated with MAE and infection severity.","Bergamaschi, Luca; D039,; Angelo, Emanuela Concetta; Paolisso, Pasquale; Toniolo, Sebastiano; Fabrizio, Michele; Angeli, Francesco; Donati, Francesco; Magnani, Ilenia; Rinaldi, Andrea; Bartoli, Lorenzo; Chiti, Chiara; Biffi, Mauro; Pizzi, Carmine; Viale, Pierluigi; Galié, Nazzareno",Ann Noninvasive Electrocardiol,,402

We aimed to describe the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Youth Quitline service and quitting behaviors of its users in Hong Kong. We conducted a telephone survey involving 201 participants of the Youth Quitline service, and retrospectively analyzed the operation and use of Quitline since the COVID-19 outbreak in Hong Kong. The number of incoming calls to the Youth Quitline and the participants' quit rate has increased since the COVID-19 outbreak in Hong Kong. Many participants (68%) did not realize that tobacco use potentially increased their risk for developing and spreading COVID-19; however, 43% agreed that the pandemic motivated their intention to quit, and 83% changed their smoking habits during the pandemic. These changes were mainly due to wearing masks (30%), closure of bars/pubs (25%), suspension of classes (14%), and being unable to socialize with friends (24%). Overall, 58% reduced their tobacco use; of these participants, 66% reported a &#8805;50% reduction in daily cigarette consumption. The participants reduced their smoking during the COVID-19 pandemic despite lacking knowledge about the potentially increased risk for contracting COVID-19 from continued smoking. The pandemic could create new opportunities to motivate young smokers to quit smoking, especially those seeking support for smoking cessation, and may further contribute to reducing the risks posed by COVID-19.","Ho, Laurie Long Kwan; Li, William Ho Cheung; Cheung, Ankie Tan; Xia, Wei; Wang, Man Ping; Cheung, Derek Yee Tak; Lam, Tai Hing",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,402

The viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) of SARS-CoV-2 has been recognized as a valuable target of antivirals. However, the cell-free SARS-CoV-2 RdRp biochemical assay requires the conversion of nucleotide prodrugs into the active triphosphate forms, which regularly occurs in cells yet is a complicated multiple-step chemical process in vitro, and thus hinders the utility of this cell-free assay in the rapid discovery of RdRp inhibitors. In addition, SARS-CoV-2 exoribonuclease provides the proof-reading capacity to viral RdRp, thus creates relatively high resistance threshold of viral RdRp to nucleotide analog inhibitors, which must be examined and evaluated in the development of this class of antivirals. Here, we report a cell-based assay to evaluate the efficacy of nucleotide analog compounds against SARS-CoV-2 RdRp and assess their tolerance to viral exoribonuclease-mediated proof-reading. By testing seven commonly used nucleotide analog viral polymerase inhibitors, Remdesivir, Molnupiravir, Ribavirin, Favipiravir, Penciclovir, Entecavir and Tenofovir, we found that both Molnupiravir and Remdesivir showed the strong inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 RdRp, with EC50 value of 0.22 µM and 0.67 µM, respectively. Moreover, our results suggested that exoribonuclease nsp14 increases resistance of SARS-CoV-2 RdRp to nucleotide analog inhibitors. We also determined that Remdesivir presented the highest resistance to viral exoribonuclease activity in cells. Therefore, we have developed a cell-based SARS-CoV-2 RdRp assay which can be deployed to discover SARS-CoV-2 RdRp inhibitors that are urgently needed to treat COVID-19 patients.","Zhao, Jianyuan; Guo, SaiSai; Yi, Dongrong; Li, Quanjie; Ma, Ling; Zhang, Yongxin; Wang, Jing; Li, Xiaoyu; Guo, Fei; Lin, Rongtuan; Liang, Chen; Liu, Zhenlong; Cen, Shan",Antiviral Res,,402

487500,"The ""Perfect Cytokine Storm"" of COVID-19/In reply",2020,"BACKGROUND: Public health measures to prevent, detect, and respond to events are essential to control public health risks, including infectious disease outbreaks, as highlighted in the International Health Regulations (IHR). In light of the outbreak of 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19), we aimed to review existing health security capacities against public health risks and events. METHODS: We used 18 indicators from the IHR State Party Annual Reporting (SPAR) tool and associated data from national SPAR reports to develop five indices: (1) prevent, (2) detect, (3) respond, (4) enabling function, and (5) operational readiness. We used SPAR 2018 data for all of the indicators and categorised countries into five levels across the indices, in which level 1 indicated the lowest level of national capacity and level 5 the highest. We also analysed data at the regional level (using the six geographical WHO regions). FINDINGS: Of 182 countries, 52 (28%) had prevent capacities at levels 1 or 2, and 60 (33%) had response capacities at levels 1 or 2. 81 (45%) countries had prevent capacities and 78 (43%) had response capacities at levels 4 or 5, indicating that these countries were operationally ready. 138 (76%) countries scored more highly in the detect index than in the other indices. 44 (24%) countries did not have an effective enabling function for public health risks and events, including infectious disease outbreaks (7 [4%] at level 1 and 37 [20%] at level 2). 102 (56%) countries had level 4 or level 5 enabling function capacities in place. 32 (18%) countries had low readiness (2 [1%] at level 1 and 30 [17%] at level 2), and 104 (57%) countries were operationally ready to prevent, detect, and control an outbreak of a novel infectious disease (66 [36%] at level 4 and 38 [21%] at level 5). INTERPRETATION: Countries vary widely in terms of their capacity to prevent, detect, and respond to outbreaks. Half of all countries analysed have strong operational readiness capacities in place, which suggests that an effective response to potential health emergencies could be enabled, including to COVID-19. Findings from local risk assessments are needed to fully understand national readiness capacities in relation to COVID-19. Capacity building and collaboration between countries are needed to strengthen global readiness for outbreak control.

Their intriguing and sophisticated biological glues have been the focus of study for decades. In all but a couple of specific taxa, however, the precise mechanisms by which the bioadhesives stick to surfaces underwater and (in many cases) harden have proved to be elusive. Since the bulk components are known to be based on proteins in most organisms, the opportunities provided by advancing 'omics technologies have revolutionised bioadhesion research. Time-consuming isolation and analysis of single molecules has been either replaced or augmented by the generation of massive data sets that describe the organism's translated genes and proteins. While these new approaches have provided resources and opportunities that have enabled physiological insights and taxonomic comparisons that were not previously possible, they do not provide the complete picture and continued multi-disciplinarity is essential. This review covers the various ways in which 'omics have contributed to our understanding of adhesion by aquatic invertebrates, with new data to illustrate key points. The associated challenges are highlighted and priorities are suggested for future research.","Davey, Peter A; Power, Anne Marie; Santos, Romana; Bertemes, Philip; Ladurner, Peter; Palmowski, Pawel; Clarke, Jessica; Flammang, Patrick; Lengerer, Birgit; Hennebert, Elise; Rothbächer, Ute; Pjeta, Robert; Wunderer, Julia; Zurovec, Michal; Aldred, Nick",Biol. rev. camb.

491401,The First Case of an HIV Patient Diagnosed with COVID-19 in Korea,2020,"Epidemics are a serious public health threat, and the resources for mitigating their effects are typically limited. Decision-makers face challenges in forecasting the demand for these resources as prior information about the disease is often not available, the behaviour of the disease can periodically change (either naturally or as a result of public health policies) and can differ by geographical region. In this work, we discuss a model that is suitable for short-term real-time supply and demand forecasting during emerging outbreaks without having to rely on demographic information. We propose a data-driven mixed-integer programming (MIP) resource allocation model that assigns available resources to maximize a notion of fairness among the resource-demanding entities. Numerical results from applying our MIP model to a COVID-19 Convalescent Plasma (CCP) case study suggest that our approach can help balance the supply and demand of limited products such as CCP and minimize the unmet demand ratios of the demand entities.","Akbari-Moghaddam, Maryam; Li, Na; Down, Douglas G.; Arnold, Donald M.; Callum, Jeannie; B'egin, Philippe; Heddle, Nancy M.",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.14667v2.pdf,402

OBJECTIVE: The study aimed to describe the Asian American community's experiences during the COVID-19 pandemic, focusing on the Greater San Francisco Bay Area, California, and to better inform a Federally Qualified Health Center's (FQHC) health care services and response to challenges faced by the community. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional survey between May 20 to June 23, 2020 using a multi-pronged recruitment approach, including word-of-mouth, FQHC patient appointments, and social media posts. The survey was self-administered online or administered over the phone by FQHC staff in English, Cantonese, Mandarin, and Vietnamese. Survey questions included COVID-19 testing and preventative behaviors, economic impacts of COVID-19, experience with perceived mistreatment due to their race/ethnicity, and mental health challenges. RESULTS: Among 1,297 Asian American respondents, only 3% were tested, and 49% stated that they could not find a place to get tested. Three-quarters of respondents reported feeling stressed, and about 23% reported feeling depressed. About 6% of respondents reported being treated unfairly because of their race/ethnicity. Among respondents who experienced economic impacts from COVID-19, 32% had lost their regular jobs and 23% had reduced hours or reduced income. Additionally, 70% of respondents shared that they avoid leaving their homes to go to public places (e.g., grocery stores, church, and school). CONCLUSIONS: We found that Asian Americans reported lower levels of COVID-19 testing and limited access to testing, high prevalence of mental health issues and economic impacts, and high prevalence of risk-avoidant behaviors (e.g., not leaving the house) in the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic. These findings provide preliminary insights into the COVID-19 impact on Asian American communities served by an FQHC and underscore the longstanding need for culturally- and linguistically-appropriate approaches to providing mental health, outreach, and education services. These findings led to the establishment of the first Asian multi-lingual and multi-cultural COVID-19 testing sites in the local area where the study was conducted, and laid the groundwork for subsequent COVID-19 programs, specifically contact tracing and vaccines.

494656,Influence of vitamin D status on hospital length of stay and prognosis in hospitalized patients with moderate to severe COVID-19: a multicenter prospective cohort study,2021,"The behaviour of a viscous drop squeezed between two horizontal planes is treated by both theory and experiment. When the squeezing force F is constant and surface tension is neglected, the theory predicts ultimate growth of the radius a~ t^{1/8}, in excellent agreement with our experiment. Surface tension at the drop boundary is included in the analysis, although negligibly small in the squeezing experiments. The circular evolution is found to be stable under small perturbations. If the force is reversed (F<0), so that the plates are pulled or levered apart, the boundary of the drop is subject to a fingering instability. The effect of a trapped air bubble at the centre of the drop is then considered. The annular evolution of the drop under constant squeezing is still found to follow a `one-eighth' power law, but this is unstable, the instability originating at the boundary of the air bubble. If the plates are drawn apart, the evolution is still subject to the fingering instability driven from the outer boundary of the annulus. This instability is realised experimentally by levering the plates apart at one corner: fingering develops at the outer boundary and spreads rapidly to the interior as the levering is slowly increased. At a later stage, small cavitation bubbles appear in the very low pressure region far from the point of leverage. This exotic behaviour is discussed in the light of the foregoing theoretical analysis.","Moffatt, Keith; Guest, Howard; Huppert, Herbert",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.14427v1.pdf,402

In recent years there have been changes in the epidemiology of this disease. AIM: To describe epidemiological, clinical and microbiological characteristics of patients with a diagnosis of IE admitted to a pediatric hospital from 2011 to 2018. METHODS: Observational, descriptive, retrospective study. Children under 15 years of age hospitalized with IE in a reference pediatric hospital in Uruguay were included. Calculations of measures of central tendency and dispersion were used, as well as absolute and percentage frequencies. RESULTS: 11 children were identified, mean age 4 years 6 months (range 5 months - 13 years). Five without risk factors, 6 with risk factors: 5 congenital heart disease (2 with cardiac surgery) and 1 central venous catheter. In 11 blood cultures were obtained prior to antibiotics, 10 a single sample, 1 with two samples. In 9 cases a microorganism was isolated. The most frequent was Staphylococcus aureus 4 children (2 methicillin resistant), followed by group viridans Streptococcus 3 children. In 10 children vegetations were found in the echocardiogram, 6 valvular. The most frequent empirical treatment was ceftriaxone and vancomycin. Complications were heart failure and septic emboli. 5 children required heart surgery. One patient died. CONCLUSIONS: An increase of IE in children without heart disease has been observed, then, it is necessary to have high clinical suspicion in febrile patients. It is important to perform blood cultures prior to the start of antibiotics and to consider coverage against Staphylococcus aureus in empirical initial treatment.","Alonso, Emilia; Leguizamón, Geraldine; Malan, Karina; Zabala, Cristina; Pirez, María Catalina",Rev Chilena Infectol,,402

METHODS: A literature search was conducted in PubMed, Web of Science, PsycINFO, and two Chinese academic databases (China National Knowledge Infrastructure and Wanfang) for studies published from December 2019 to September 2020 that reported the prevalence of above mental health problems among children and adolescents. Random-effects meta-analyses were used to estimate the pooled prevalence. RESULTS: Twenty-three studies (21 cross-sectional studies and 2 longitudinal studies) from two countries (i.e., China and Turkey) with 57,927 children and adolescents were identified. Depression, anxiety, sleep disorders, and posttraumatic stress symptoms were assessed in 12, 13, 2, and 2 studies, respectively. Meta-analysis of results from these studies showed that the pooled prevalence of depression, anxiety, sleep disorders, and posttraumatic stress symptoms were 29% (95%CI: 17%, 40%), 26% (95%CI: 16%, 35%), 44% (95%CI: 21%, 68%), and 48% (95%CI: -0.25, 1.21), respectively. The subgroup meta-analysis revealed that adolescents and females exhibited higher prevalence of depression and anxiety compared to children and males, respectively. LIMITATIONS: All studies in meta-analysis were from China limited the generalizability of our findings. CONCLUSIONS: Early evidence highlights the high prevalence of mental health problems among children and adolescents during the COVID-19 pandemic, especially among female and adolescents. Studies investigating the mental health of children and adolescents from countries other than China are urgently needed.","Ma, Lu; Mazidi, Mohsen; Li, Ke; Li, Yixuan; Chen, Shiqi; Kirwan, Richard; Zhou, Haixia; Yan, Na; Rahman, Atif; Wang, Weidong; Wang, Youfa",J Affect Disord,,402

The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has caused sudden changes in lifestyle. Thus, this study examined the associations of participation in an exercise class before the COVID-19 pandemic and the exercise habits and disruption to the rhythms of daily life during the COVID-19 state of emergency with perceived declining physical and cognitive fitness among community-dwelling old-old adults. METHODS: In July 2020, we carried out a mail survey of community-dwelling old-old adults aged between 77 and 99 years in Bibai, Hokkaido, Japan, to determine their perceived declining physical and cognitive fitness during the COVID-19 state of emergency. RESULTS: Of the 774 responders, 339 (43.8%) participants reported a decline in physical fitness, whereas 259 (33.5%) perceived declining cognitive fitness during the COVID-19 state of emergency. In a multivariate logistic regression model adjusted for potential confounders, exercise habits during the COVID-19 state of emergency were significantly associated with a lower perception of declining physical fitness. Disruption to the rhythms of daily life during the COVID-19 state of emergency was significantly associated with a higher perception of declining physical and cognitive fitness. CONCLUSIONS: Approximately half and more than one-third of community-dwelling old-old adults perceived declining physical and cognitive fitness, respectively, during the COVID-19 state of emergency. During this period, exercise habits were positively correlated with perceived health status among old-old adults, whereas disruption to the rhythms of daily life was negatively correlated.

Several reports indicate the possibility of viral shedding via faeces and the possibility of faecal-oral transmission. AIMS: To critically assess the clinical relevance of testing stool samples and anal swabs and provide an overview of the potential faecal-oral transmission of SARS-CoV-2. METHODS: A systematic literature search with MeSH terms was performed, scrutinising the Embase database, Google scholar, MEDLINE database through PubMed and The Cochrane Library, including articles from December 2019 until July 7 2020. Data were subsequently analysed with descriptive statistics. RESULTS: Ninety-five studies were included in the qualitative analysis. 934/2149 (43%) patients tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 in stool samples or anal swabs, with positive test results up to 70 days after symptom onset. A meta-analysis executed with studies of at least 10 patients revealed a pooled positive proportion of 51.8% (95% CI 43.8 - 59.7%). Positive faecal samples of 282/443 patients (64%) remained positive for SARS-CoV-2 for a mean of 12.5 days, up to 33 days maximum, after respiratory samples became negative for SARS-CoV-2. Viable SARS-CoV-2 was found in 6/17 (35%) patients in whom this was specifically investigated. CONCLUSIONS: Viral shedding of SARS-CoV-2 in stool samples occurs in a substantial proportion of patients, making faecal-oral transmission plausible.

500498,Same-day Discharge after Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement during the Covid-19 Pandemic,2021,"BACKGROUND: Virus outbreaks such as the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic are challenging for health care workers (HCWs), affecting their workload and their mental health. Since both, workload and HCW's well-being are related to the quality of care, continuous monitoring of working hours and indicators of mental health in HCWs is of relevance during the current pandemic. The existing investigations, however, have been limited to a single study period. We examined changes in working hours and mental health in Swiss HCWs at the height of the pandemic (T1) and again after its flattening (T2). METHODS: We conducted two cross-sectional online studies among Swiss HCWs assessing working hours, depression, anxiety, and burnout. From each study, 812 demographics-matched participants were included into the analysis. Working hours and mental health were compared between the two samples. RESULTS: Compared to prior to the pandemic, the share of participants working less hours was the same in both samples, whereas the share of those working more hours was lower in the T2 sample. The level of depression did not differ between the samples. In the T2 sample, participants reported more anxiety, however, this difference was below the minimal clinically important difference. Levels of burnout were slightly higher in the T2 sample. CONCLUSIONS: Two weeks after the health care system started to transition back to normal operations, HCWs' working hours still differed from their regular hours in non-pandemic times. Overall anxiety and depression among HCWs did not change substantially over the course of the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.","Spiller, Tobias R; Méan, Marie; Ernst, Jutta; Sazpinar, Onur; Gehrke, Samuel; Paolercio, Francesca; Petry, Heidi; Pfaltz, Monique C; Morina, Naser; Aebischer, Oriane; Gachoud, David; von Känel, Roland; Weilenmann, Sonja",Psychol Med,,402
501221,Clinical characteristics of older patients with COVID-19: A systematic review of case reports,2021,"Melanoma is not the most common form of skin cancer, but it is the most deadly. Currently, the disease is diagnosed by expert dermatologists, which is costly and requires timely access to medical treatment. Recent advances in deep learning have the potential to improve diagnostic performance, expedite urgent referrals and reduce burden on clinicians. Through smart phones, the technology could reach people who would not normally have access to such healthcare services, e.g. in remote parts of the world, due to financial constraints or in 2020, COVID-19 cancellations. To this end, we have investigated various transfer learning approaches by leveraging model parameters pre-trained on ImageNet with finetuning on melanoma detection. We compare EfficientNet, MnasNet, MobileNet, DenseNet, SqueezeNet, ShuffleNet, GoogleNet, ResNet, ResNeXt, VGG and a simple CNN with and without transfer learning. We find the mobile network, EfficientNet (with transfer learning) achieves the best mean performance with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.931$\pm$0.005 and an area under the precision recall curve (AUPRC) of 0.840$\pm$0.010. This is significantly better than general practitioners (0.83$\pm$0.03 AUROC) and dermatologists (0.91$\pm$0.02 AUROC).","Rocheteau, Emma; Kim, Doyoon",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.04475v3.pdf,402

To face the pandemic outbreak, hospitals converted wards to assure COVID-19 patients' care and adopted measures to reduce virus diffusion. The aim of this study was to determine how many physiotherapists, in the Lombardy region, worked during pandemic, whether they continued their usual practice or were employed in COVID-19 wards and in which tasks they were involved. The survey was submitted online by the national professional order. The response rate was 11.79%. During the pandemic, 648 (53.9%) respondents interrupted their services. Less than 20% of the physiotherapists that continued working were assigned to COVID-19 wards with the role of physiotherapist. Only a small proportion of respondents had advanced skills in respiratory physiotherapy. Moreover, this study showed a limited involvement of physiotherapists inside the very acute and intense settings. In conclusion, this work revealed that, during COVID-19 pandemic, in the Lombardy region a small percentage of physiotherapists was employed in COVID-19 wards, mainly in post-acute context. Even though the response rate of this survey was very low, this study highlights the need to define and underline the role of physiotherapy in acute setting during emergency.","Privitera, Emilia; D039,; Abrosca, Francesco; Gaudiello, Giuseppe; Lazzeri, Marta; Bellofiore, Angela; Frigerio, Pamela; Santambrogio, Martina",Monaldi arch. chest dis,,402

As opposed to what was believed at the beginning of the pandemic, the virus has not only spread but persevere causing secondary waves and challenging the concept of herd immunity against viral infections. While the majority of SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals may remain asymptomatic, a fraction of individuals may develop low to high-grade severity signs and symptoms of COVID-19. The disease is multifactorial and can progress quickly, leading to severe complications and even death in a few days. Therefore, understanding the pre-existing factors for disease development has never been so pressing. In this scenario, the insights on the mechanisms underlying disease allied to the immune response developed during the viral invasion could shed light on novel predictive factors and prognostic tools for COVID-19 management and interventions. A recent genome-wide association study (GWAS) revealed several molecules that significantly impacted critically ill COVID-19 patients, leading to the core mechanisms of COVID-19 pathogenesis. Considering these findings and the fact that ACE-2 polymorphisms alone cannot explain disease progress and severity, this review aims at summarizing the most important and recent findings of the research and expert consensus of possible cytokine-related polymorphisms existing in the differential expression of paramount immune molecules that could be crucial for providing guidelines for decision-making and appropriate clinical management of COVID-19.","Paim, Adriana Alves Oliveira; Lopes-Ribeiro, Ágata; Daian E Silva, Daniele S O; Andrade, Luis Adan F; Moraes, Thais F S; Barbosa-Stancioli, Edel F; da Fonseca, Flávio Guimarães; Coelho-Dos-Reis, Jordana G",Immunol Lett,,402

For the self-testing strategy, participants received the necessary material for the self-collection of blood and performance of a rapid antibody test using lateral flow immunoassay at home without the supervision of healthcare personnel. A total of 1,022 participants were enrolled. Most participants correctly performed the COVID-19 self-test the first time (91.3% [95% CI 89.4-92.9]). Only a minority of the participants (0.7%) needed the help of healthcare personnel, while 6.9% required a second kit delivery, for a total valid test result in 96.9% of the participants.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the characteristics of a nosocomial adenovirus outbreak in an ICU. METHODS: We evaluated all the patients treated and the medical staff working in the ICU from August 1 to September 4, 2019. We further performed an epidemiological and molecular analysis for this outbreak from patient to healthcare workers and between healthcare workers. After the outbreak, we adopted exposure prevention and droplet prevention measures based on standard precautions. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Between August 1 and August 27, 2019, 27 cases of human adenovirus cross-infection were reported in our institution. Among the cases, eleven were doctors (41%), eleven were nurses (41%), three were respiratory therapists (11%), and two were caregivers (7%). The attack rate was 28.4%, and the fatality rate was 0. The results showed that contact with the index case, lack of hand hygiene or gloving adherence were risk factors for infection after adenovirus exposure. After taking specific precautions, no new cases of infection have appeared since August 27. CONCLUSIONS: Our results show that HAdV55 in a single patient had strong transmission potential in an intensive care unit with adequate facilities and standardized operation. We provide convincing evidence indicating that attention could be highlighted on the role of standard and specific precautions for controlling the spread of adenovirus in ICUs.","Dai, Minhui; Wu, Yanhao; Tan, Hongyi; Deng, Jing; Hou, Maodan; Peng, Wenzhong; Chen, Guo; Li, Yi; Li, Haitao; Pan, Pinhua; Lu, Jingmei",Int J Infect Dis,,402

510300,Ethics guidance on issues raised by the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic,2020,"Hepatitis E virus (HEV) typically causes self-limiting acute viral hepatitis, however chronic infection and extrahepatic manifestations have increasingly become a significant health problem. Domestic pigs and wild boars are the main reservoirs of HEV genotype 3 and genotype 4 for human infections in industrialized countries, although molecular and serological evidence suggest that several additional animal species may act as HEV hosts. In this study, by assessing serologically and molecularly the sera of 324 household cats from Apulia region (Italy), HEV antibodies were detected with an overall prevalence of 3.1%. Viral RNA was not detected in the sera of the animals using both HEV-specific assays and a pan-hepevirus broadly reactive set of primers for Hepeviridae. These findings document a low seroprevalence to HEV in cats in the investigated geographical setting. The exact nature of the HEV-like strains circulating in feline population remains to be established.","Capozza, Paolo; Martella, Vito; Lanave, Gianvito; Beikpour, Farzad; Di Profio, Federica; Palombieri, Andrea; Sarchese, Vittorio; Marsilio, Fulvio; La Rosa, Giuseppina; Suffredini, Elisabetta; Camero, Michele; Buonavoglia, Canio; Di Martino, Barbara",Res Vet Sci,,402
510377,COVID-19-induced vascular angiopathy: CTPA signs in critically ill patients other than acute pulmonary embolism and high-lung opacity scores,2021,"The 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has exacerbated inequality in the United States of America (USA). Black, indigenous, and people of color (BIPOC) are disproportionately affected by the pandemic. This study examines determinants of COVID-19 case fatality ratio (CFR) based on publicly sourced data from January 1 to December 18, 2020, and sociodemographic and rural-urban continuum data from the US Census Bureau. Nonspatial negative binomial Poisson regression and geographically weighted Poisson regression were applied to estimate the global and local relationships between the CFR and predictors-rural-urban continuum, political inclination, and race/ethnicity in 2407 rural counties. The mean COVID-19 CFR among rural counties was 1.79 (standard deviation (SD) = 1.07; 95% CI 1.73-1.84) higher than the total US counties (M = 1.69, SD = 1.18; 95% CI: 1.65-1.73). Based on the global NB model, CFR was positively associated with counties classified as ""completely rural"" (incidence rate ratio (IRR) = 1.24; 95% CI: 1.12-1.39) and ""mostly rural"" (IRR = 1.26; 95% CI: 1.15-1.38) relative to ""mostly urban"" counties. Nonspatial regression indicates that COVID-19 CFR increases by a factor of 8.62, 5.87, 2.61, and 1.36 for one unit increase in county-level percent Blacks, Hispanics, American Indians, and Asian/Pacific Islanders, respectively. Local spatial regression shows CFR was significantly higher in rural counties with a higher share of BIPOC in the Northeast and Midwest regions, and political inclination predicted COVID-19 CFR in rural counties in the Midwest region. In conclusion, spatial and racial/ethnic disparities exist for COVID-19 CFR across the US rural counties, and findings from this study have implications for public health.","Iyanda, Ayodeji E; Boakye, Kwadwo A; Lu, Yongmei; Oppong, Joseph R",J. racial ethnic health disparities (Internet),,402

Unfortunately, to date there is no highly effective treatment, so a deep understanding of COVID-19 risk factors could be an important step in treating the disease. Vitamin D affects the immune system in many different ways, and other authors already found that COVID-19 patients have low levels of vitamin D. In our retrospective study, we evaluated the vitamin D status at the time of hospital admission in 50 COVID-19 patients in Sicily, which is the southernmost region of Italy, and compared them with 100 control subjects matched for age and sex. Our data showed markedly low levels of vitamin D in patients with a positive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), but no association was found with inflammation markers or clinical severity. Vitamin D levels were reduced at the time of hospital admission in Sicilian SARS-CoV-2-positive patients, but it is not clear whether this condition has an impact on the clinical course of COVID-19.","Gaudio, Agostino; Murabito, Andrea Ruben; Agodi, Antonella; Montineri, Arturo; Castellino, Pietro",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,402

METHODS: Review of published guidelines produced by Urological Governing Bodies, followed by the literature review regarding urolithiasis management during the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS: Consistent recommendations across guidelines and literature were that urolithiasis with concurrent sepsis or renal failure remains a urological emergency warranting urgent intervention within the pandemic environment. Ureteric stenting and percutaneous nephrostomy are considered equivalent for decompression in this setting, with both ideally to be performed under local anaesthesia where possible to spare ventilators and reduce aerosol-generating procedures. Greater utilization of medical expulsive therapy and dissolution chemolysis may occur during the pandemic, and longer indwelling stent times may be accepted while definite stone clearance is deferred. CONCLUSIONS: Urolithiasis will continue to be a source of emergency presentations requiring urgent intervention during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, it is possible to limit these interventions to decompression of the collecting system in the setting of concurrent obstruction or infection, performed under local anaesthesia to limit use of resources and minimise aerosol-generating procedures, with deferral of definitive management.","Heijkoop, B; Galiabovitch, E; York, N; Webb, D",World j. urol,,402

513623,"A Response to: Letter to the Editor Regarding Combination of Tocilizumab and Steroids to Improve Mortality in Patients with Severe COVID-19 Infection: A Spanish, Multicenter, Cohort",2021,"Type 2 diabetes mellitus, obesity, hypertension, and other associated metabolic complications have been demonstrated as a crucial contributor to the enhanced morbidity and mortality of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Data on the interplay between metabolic comorbidities and the outcomes in patients with COVID-19 have been emerging and rapidly increasing. This implies a mechanistic link between metabolic diseases and COVID-19 resulting in the exacerbation of the condition. Nonetheless, new evidences are emerging to support insulin-mediated aggressive glucose-lowering treatment as a possible trigger of high mortality rate in diabetic COVID-19 patients, putting the clinician in a confounding and difficult dilemma for the treatment of COVID-19 patients with metabolic comorbidities. Thus, this review discusses the pathophysiological link among severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), metabolic complications, and severe inflammation in COVID-19 development, especially in those with multi-organ injuries. We discuss the influence of several routinely used drugs in COVID-19 patients, including anti-inflammatory and anti-coagulant drugs, antidiabetic drugs, renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors. Especially, we provide a balanced overview on the clinical application of glucose-lowering drugs (insulin and metformin), angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors, and angiotensin receptor blockers. Although there is insufficient evidence from clinical or basic research to comprehensively reveal the mechanistic link between adverse outcomes in COVID-19 and metabolic comorbidities, it is hoped that the update in the current review may help to better outline the optimal strategies for clinical management of COVID-19 patients with metabolic comorbidities.","Hua, Shuang; Yang, Yong; Zou, Danqi; Li, Jufei; Yan, Kaixuan; Xu, Ying; Jiang, Xue; Rong, Xianglu; Ye, Dewei",Biomed Pharmacother,,402
514352,Dynamic data-driven meta-analysis for prioritisation of host genes implicated in COVID-19,2020,"PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the frequency of various otolaryngological symptoms in patients with COVID-19 with regard to age, gender and pneumonia-related thorax CT characteristics. METHODS: This is a retrospective study conducted between March 25, 2020 and April 25, 2020. The anamnesis and medical files of 155 patients who applied to our outpatient COVID-19 clinic were evaluated. Patients with positive PCR tests for COVID-19 who were aged between 18-72 years were divided into groups according to the presence of otolaryngological symptoms. The differences between the two groups were examined. RESULTS: Of the 155 patients, 89 (57.4%) had otolaryngological symptoms. The mean age of the patients was 36.3 ± 8.1 years. Ninety-one (58.7%) patients were female, and 64 (42.2%) were male. Fifty-eight (37.4%) patients had received a clinical diagnosis of viral pneumonia with ground glass findings in tomography. The frequency of otolaryngological symptoms was higher in females than males (p: 0.029). The otolaryngological symptoms were also observed to be more frequent in the 18-30 age group (p: 0.013) compared to other age groups. CONCLUSIONS: Tinnitus, gingivitis, sudden hearing loss, Bell's palsy, and hoarseness can be seen in COVID-19, albeit rarely. Revealing the otolaryngological symptoms of COVID-19, and obtaining more information about the extent of disease will be useful in managing patients and their complaints associated with otolaryngology.","Elibol, Elif",Eur. arch. oto-rhino-laryngol,,402
514502,Swollen heart in COVID-19 patients who progress to critical illness: a perspective from echo-cardiologists,2020,"Traditional disease surveillance systems suffer from several disadvantages, including reporting lags and antiquated technology, that have caused a movement towards internet-based disease surveillance systems. Internet systems are particularly attractive for disease outbreaks because they can provide data in near real-time and can be verified by individuals around the globe. However, most existing systems have focused on disease monitoring and do not provide a data repository for policy makers or researchers. In order to fill this gap, we analyzed Wikipedia article content. We demonstrate how a named-entity recognizer can be trained to tag case counts, death counts, and hospitalization counts in the article narrative that achieves an F1 score of 0.753. We also show, using the the 2014 West African Ebola virus disease epidemic article as a case study, that there are detailed time series data that are consistently updated that closely align with ground truth data. We argue that Wikipedia can be used to create the first community-driven open-source emerging disease detection, monitoring, and repository system.","Fairchild, Geoffrey; Silva, Lalindra De; Valle, Sara Y.

514664,Clinically significant portal hypertension in cirrhosis patients with COVID-19: clinical characteristics and outcomes,2020,"OBJECTIVES: A virtual standardized patient-based assessment simulator was developed to address biases and practical limitations in existing methods for evaluating residents' proficiency in psychopharmacological knowledge and practice. METHODS: The simulator was designed to replicate an outpatient psychiatric clinic experience. The virtual patient reported symptoms of a treatment-resistant form of major depressive disorder (MDD), requiring the learner to use various antidepressants in order for the patient to fully remit. Test scores were based on the proportion of correct responses to questions asked by the virtual patient about possible side effects, dosing, and titration decisions, which depended upon the patient's tolerability and response to the learner's selected medications. The validation paradigm included a novice-expert performance comparison across 4th year medical students, psychiatric residents from all four post-graduate year classes, and psychiatry department faculty, and a correlational analysis of simulator performance with the PRITE Somatic Treatments subscale score. Post-test surveys evaluated the test takers' subjective impressions of the simulator. RESULTS: Forty-three subjects completed the online exam and survey. Total mean scores on the exam differed significantly across all the learner groups in a step-wise manner from students to faculty (F = 6.10, p = 0.0001). Total mean scores by residency class correlated with PRITE Somatic Therapies subscale scores (p < 0.01). The post-test survey mean Likert results ranged from 3.33 ± 1.20 to 4.4 ± 0.79, indicating neutral to favorable responses for use of the simulator. CONCLUSIONS: This simulator demonstrated strong construct validity and high participant acceptability for assessing proficiency in the psychopharmacologic treatment of MDD.","Rakofsky, Jeffrey J; Talbot, Thomas B; Dunlop, Boadie W",Acad. psychiatry,,402
514665,Clinically significant portal hypertension in cirrhosis patients with COVID-19: Clinical characteristics and outcomes,2020,"Extreme events gain tremendous attention due to their utmost importance in a variety of diverse contexts ranging from climate science to neuroscience. Excursions of a relevant observable from its long-term average to extraordinary values have the capability of bringing adverse consequences. We provide here a comprehensive review to incorporate the recent efforts in understanding such extremely large-amplitude events from the perspective of dynamical systems and random walkers. We emphasize, in detail, the mechanisms responsible for the emergence of such events in the complex systems. We discuss the prediction of extreme events from two different contexts using (i) dynamical instabilities and (ii) machine learning algorithms. Tracking of instabilities in the phase space is not always feasible and precise knowledge of the dynamics of extreme events does not necessarily help in forecasting extreme events. Moreover, in most studies on high-dimensional systems, only a few degrees of freedom participate in extreme events' formation. Thus, the notable inclusion of prediction through machine learning is of enormous significance, particularly for those cases where the governing equations of the model are explicitly unavailable. Besides, random walk on the complex networks is capable of representing several transport processes, and exceedances of the flux of walkers above a prescribed threshold may describe extreme events. We unveil the theoretical studies on random walkers with their enormous potential for applications in reducing extreme events and also discuss possible controlling strategies. This review presents an overview of the current trend of research on extreme events in dynamical systems and networks, including random walkers, and discusses future possibilities. We conclude this review with the extended outlook and compelling perspective for further investigation.","Chowdhury, Sayantan Nag; Ray, Arnob; Dana, Syamal K.; Ghosh, Dibakar",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2109.11219v1.pdf,402
515279,Soluble Urokinase Plasminogen Activator Receptor: A Biomarker for Predicting Complications and Critical Care Admission of COVID-19 Patients,2020,"The COVID-19 pandemic has illuminated preference of children with autism spectrum disorder of near average to above average intelligence (high functioning autism - HFA) for remote learning. While many children with HFA excel at the academic curriculum, the majority struggle with the so-called hidden curriculum, which includes such things as social rules and societal norms. Explicit teaching of the hidden curriculum is often lacking in mainstream education classes and can be a tremendous stumbling block for children with HFA. The result is often anxiety and depression which can be exacerbated or sometimes even caused by the intense demands for sociability and flexibility required in most mainstream educational settings. Remote learning, while not a legitimate option until now, has provided these children with an opportunity to flourish at home and improve not only their grades but also their mental health. While remote learning or hybrid models may continue to be appropriate for some children, understanding of the hidden curriculum is necessary beyond the school years. Both mental health and academic proficiency will flourish to the degree we are able to make the hidden curriculum more explicit to children with HFA.","Reicher, Debra",Child Adolesc Ment Health,,402
515335,Remote interventions to improve exercise behaviour in sedentary people living with and beyond cancer: a systematic review and meta-analysis,2021,"BACKGROUND: Despite considerable progress, it remains unclear why some patients admitted for COVID-19 develop adverse outcomes while others recover spontaneously. Clues may lie with the predisposition to hypoxemia or unexpected absence of dyspnea ('silent hypoxemia') in some patients who later develop respiratory failure. Using a recently-validated breath-holding technique, we sought to test the hypothesis that gas exchange and ventilatory control deficits observed at admission are associated with subsequent adverse COVID-19 outcomes (composite primary outcome: non-invasive ventilatory support, intensive care admission, or death). METHODS: Patients with COVID-19 (N = 50) performed breath-holds to obtain measurements reflecting the predisposition to oxygen desaturation (mean desaturation after 20-s) and reduced chemosensitivity to hypoxic-hypercapnia (including maximal breath-hold duration). Associations with the primary composite outcome were modeled adjusting for baseline oxygen saturation, obesity, sex, age, and prior cardiovascular disease. Healthy controls (N = 23) provided a normative comparison. RESULTS: The adverse composite outcome (observed in N = 11/50) was associated with breath-holding measures at admission (likelihood ratio test, p = 0.020); specifically, greater mean desaturation (12-fold greater odds of adverse composite outcome with 4% compared with 2% desaturation, p = 0.002) and greater maximal breath-holding duration (2.7-fold greater odds per 10-s increase, p = 0.036). COVID-19 patients who did not develop the adverse composite outcome had similar mean desaturation to healthy controls. CONCLUSIONS: Breath-holding offers a novel method to identify patients with high risk of respiratory failure in COVID-19. Greater breath-hold induced desaturation (gas exchange deficit) and greater breath-holding tolerance (ventilatory control deficit) may be independent harbingers of progression to severe disease.","Messineo, Ludovico; Perger, Elisa; Corda, Luciano; Joosten, Simon A; Fanfulla, Francesco; Pedroni, Leonardo; Terrill, Philip I; Lombardi, Carolina; Wellman, Andrew; Hamilton, Garun S; Malhotra, Atul; Vailati, Guido; Parati, Gianfranco; Sands, Scott A",Crit Care,,402

This article uses the example of the public health services in Sweden, France and Austria to address the question of the similarities and differences in the measures taken to combat the pandemic (status: November 2020).Among the countries presented in this article, Austria is the least affected by the pandemic and France is the most affected. In all analysed health systems there is a tension between national and regional responsibilities. France's healthcare system is particularly centralized, while Sweden's is strongly regional and municipal. Governments in the nation states are striving to obtain pandemic containment powers independent of parliamentary decisions. Sweden differs from Austria and France in that its pandemic containment strategy is based primarily on recommendations and appeals rather than directives and bans. The sequences of action during the pandemic and, apart from Sweden, the instruments used to contain the pandemic are similar. The course of the pandemic and the measures taken in Austria and France show clear parallels with those in Germany. The protection of particularly vulnerable groups has not been sufficiently successful in all countries and remains a challenge to be met.","Gerlinger, Thomas; Schmidt, Phillip Florian; Lückenbach, Caspar",Bundesgesundheitsblatt Gesundheitsforschung Gesundheitsschutz,,402

There are currently no standardized recommendations for the information provided on web sites. The aim of this study was to assess the information available on each national plastic surgery society web site on the current pandemic of COVID-19. METHODS: A Google search was performed of United Nations member sovereign states to determine whether they had a national plastic surgery society web site and to assess its contents. The presence of COVID-19 information was recorded. Access to contact information, Facebook page, Twitter, and Instagram handles were noted. RESULTS: Thirty-five percent of sovereign states had plastic surgery society web sites. Twenty-two percent of national society web sites had a specific COVID-19 section. Fourteen (93%) of these 15 web sites had COVID-19-specific guidelines available for health care professionals. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 information provided by national plastic surgery society web sites is sparse. Two-thirds of national plastic surgery societies do not have a web presence. The availability of COVID-19 clinical guidelines and patient information sheets on national plastic surgery society web sites is limited.

This study protocol describes an approach designed to provide an in-depth understanding of how companies and their employees in Germany deal with their working conditions during the COVID-19 pandemic. We are also interested in how and why the risk of infection with SARS-CoV-2 could vary across different professional activities, company sites and regions with different epidemiological activity or infection control measures in Germany. We expect the results of this study to contribute to the development of working conditions protecting the health of employees during and beyond the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: An explorative multimodal mixed methods approach will be applied. Module 1 comprises a document analysis of prevailing federal and regional laws and regulations at the respective location of the participating company. Module 2 includes qualitative interviews with key actors at different companies. Module 3 is a repeated standardised employee survey designed to capture potential changes in the participants' experiences and attitudes towards working conditions, occupational safety regulations/measures, and infection control measures during the COVID-19 pandemic. Module 4 comprises SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence testing. This is carried out by the medical service of the participating company sites as a voluntary offer for employees. Qualitative data will be analysed through document and content analysis. The complexity of the quantitative analysis depends on the response rates of modules 3 and 4. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The approval of the study design was received in June 2020 from the responsible local ethical committee of the Medical Faculty, University of Tübingen and University Hospital Tübingen (No. 423/2020BO). The results will be presented at national and international conferences and published in peer-reviewed journals.","Rind, Esther; Kimpel, Klaus; Preiser, Christine; Papenfuss, Falko; Wagner, Anke; Alsyte, Karina; Siegel, Achim; Klink, Antje; Steinhilber, Benjamin; Kauderer, Johanna; Rieger, Monika A",BMJ Open,,402

519523,Pseudo acute myocardial infarction in a young COVID-19 patient,2020,"Objective: The aim of this study was to provide recommendations for improving the design of subsequent studies through analysis of the registered coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) clinical trials.Methods: A retrospective analysis of 189 trial retrievals achieved on 20 February 2020.Results: A total of 189 trials are included in the study. There were 69.3% interventional studies, 21.7% observational studies, 5.3% diagnostic tests and 3.7% other studies. The following statistics are provided only for the interventional studies. Severity of disease: 5.3% light and common type, 17.6% severe and critically ill and 59.6% with no restricted classification. Medication use: 51.1% Western medicine, 32.1% Chinese medicine, 10.7% blood related product and 6.1% non-drug therapy. The median and inner quantile range of the sample sizes included in these studies: 104 (IQR: 60, 200). Primary outcome type most used: 45.8% with clinical characteristics and 21.4% with virological. Study design characteristics: 71% of all studies were randomized, 5% of all studies were blinded, 18% of all studies were multicenter and 76% of all studies were single center.Conclusion: Although many COVID-19 studies include randomization in their design, the lack of additional double-blind and placebo-controlled elements in their designs result in a less robust evaluation of intervention safety and efficacy. Furthermore, similar or repeated research and small sample studies that have less promise in gains of new information have possibly led to a shortage of recruitable patients and become a barrier to the completion of large multicenter clinical trial studies.","Wang, Bin; Lai, Junkai; Yan, Xiaoyan; Jin, Feifei; Yao, Chen",Curr Med Res Opin,,402

519808,Proposal to Unify the Colorimetric Triage System With the Standardized Lung Ultrasound Score for COVID-19,2020,"AIMS: The recent emergence of novel, pathogenic severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) poses a global health emergency. The coronaviral entry requires the spike (S)-protein for attachment to the host cell surface, and employs human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) for entry and transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) for S-protein priming. Although coronaviruses undergo evolution by mutating themselves, it is also essential to know the host genetic factors. Here, we describe the single nucleotide variations (SNVs) in human ACE2 and TMPRSS2. METHODS: The genetic variants derived from five population-sequencing projects were classified by variant type, allele frequency (AF), ethnic group and estimated pathogenicity. The SNVs in SARS-CoV-2/hACE2 contact residues were investigated. The genetic variability was normalised using non-linear regression and the total number of SNVs was estimated by the derived formulas. RESULTS: We detected 349 and 551 SNVs in ACE2 and TMPRSS2, respectively, in a total of 156 513 individuals. The vast majority (>97%) of the SNVs were very rare (AF <0.1%) and population-specific, and were computationally estimated to be more frequently deleterious than the SNVs with high AF. These SNVs were distributed throughout the coding regions; some ACE2 variants were located in the SARS-CoV-2/hACE2 contact residues, with a hemizygous state occurring in males. Using regression analysis, the total numbers of genetic variations in ACE2 and TMPRSS2 were 1.1×103 and 1.5×103, respectively, for a population of one million people. CONCLUSION: The majority of SNVs in ACE2 and TMPRSS2 are rare, population-specific and deleterious, and a multitude of very rare SNVs may explain different susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2.","Fujikura, Kohei; Uesaka, Kazuma",J. clin. pathol,,402

521987,Aortic Thrombosis in the Course of Covid-19 Disease; Two Rare Cases,2021,"BACKGROUND: There is very limited comprehensive information on disparate outcomes of black and white patients with COVID-19 infection. Reports from cities and states have suggested a discordant impact on black Americans, but no nationwide study has yet been performed. We sought to understand the differential outcomes for black and white Americans infected with COVID-19. METHODS: We obtained case-level data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on 76,442 white and 48,338 non-Hispanic Black patients diagnosed with COVID-19, ages 0 to >80+, outlining information on hospitalization, ICU admission, ventilation, and death outcomes. Multivariate Poisson regressions were used to estimate the association of race, treating white as the reference group, controlling for sex, age group, and the presence of comorbidities. RESULTS: Black patients were generally younger than white, were more often female, and had larger numbers of comorbidities. Compared to white patients with COVID-19, black patients had 1.4 times the risk of hospitalization (RR 1.42, p < 0.001), and almost twice the risk of requiring ICU care (RR 1.68, p < 0.001) or ventilatory support (RR 1.81, p < 0.001) after adjusting for covariates. Black patients saw a 1.36 times increased risk of death (RR 1.36, p < 0.001) compared to white. Disparities between black and white outcomes increased with advanced age. CONCLUSION: Despite the initial descriptions of COVID-19 being a disease that affects all individuals, regardless of station, our data demonstrate the differential racial effects in the United States. This current pandemic reinforces the need to assess the unequal effects of crises on disadvantaged populations to promote population health.","Poulson, Michael; Geary, Alaina; Annesi, Chandler; Allee, Lisa; Kenzik, Kelly; Sanchez, Sabrina; Tseng, Jennifer; Dechert, Tracey",J. natl. med. assoc,,402

On the one hand, population dynamics influence the environment and the global climate system through consumption-based carbon emissions. On the other hand, health and wellbeing of the population is already being affected by climate change. The knowledge on population dynamics and population heterogeneity thus is fundamental in improving our understanding of how population size, composition and distribution influence global environmental change and how these changes affect subgroups of population differentially by demographic characteristics and spatial distribution. Existing theoretical concepts and methodological tools in demography can be readily applied to the study of population and global environmental change. In the past couple of decades, demographic research has enriched climate change research both in the analysis of the impact of population dynamics on the global climate system as well as the impact of climate change on human population. What is missing in the literature is the study that investigates how global environmental change affect current and future demographic processes and consequently population trends. If global environmental change does influence fertility, mortality and migration, the three key demographic components underlying population change, population estimates and forecast need to adjust from the climate feedback in population projections. Indisputably, this is the new area of research that directly requires expertise in population science and contribution from demographers.","Muttarak, Raya",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.00757v1.pdf,402

In this study, we aimed at assessing the impact social media has on the anxiety level of dental healthcare workers (DHCWs) whilst living through the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: An online questionnaire was disseminated to a cross-sectional sample of DHCWs from 19 countries using social media platforms. The questionnaire enquired about DHCWs’ frequency of using social media and their dependency on health-related information posted on those platforms. Anxiety was measured using General Anxiety Disorder scale (GAD-7). RESULTS: Four-hundred and three (403) DHCWs completed the online questionnaire. Sixty-eight percent (68%) frequently use social media for information on COVID-19. The frequency of social media use was higher among younger DHCWs, with shorter clinical experience, and holders of undergraduate qualifications (p = 0.009, p = 0.002, and p = 0.023, respectively). Almost one third of DHCWs had moderate to severe anxiety (31.7%), which was significantly associated with the frequency of social media use (p = 0.016).

591569,External validation of the IMPROVE-DD risk assessment model for venous thromboembolism among inpatients with COVID-19,2021-06-19,"Summary Advances in understanding and controlling genes and their expression have set the stage to alter genetic material to fight or prevent disease with brain tumors being among one of the first human malignancies to be targeted by gene therapy. All proteins are coded for by DNA and most neoplastic diseases ultimately result from the expression or lack thereof with one or more proteins (e.g., coded by oncogenes or tumor suppressor genes, respectively). In theory, therefore, diseases could be treated by expression of the appropriate protein in the affected cells. Gene therapy is an experimental treatment that involves introducing genetic material (DNA or RNA) into cells, and it has made important advances in the past decade. Within this short time span, it has moved from the conceptual laboratory research stage to clinical translational trials for brain tumors. The most efficient approaches for gene delivery are based on viral vectors, which have been proven relatively safe in the CNS, despite occasional cases of morbidity and death in non-neurosurgical trials. However, the human response to various viral vectors can not be predicted in a reliable manner from animal experimentation, nor can size, consistency, and extent of experimental brain tumors in mouse models reflect the large, necrotic, infiltrative nature of malignant gliomas. Furthermore, the problem of delivering genetic vectors into solid brain tumors and the efficiency in situ gene transfer remains one of the most significant hurdles in gene therapy.","Asadi-Moghaddam, Kaveh; Chiocca, E.

592525,"Medical treatment of 55 patients with COVID-19 from seven cities in northeast China who fully recovered: a single-center, retrospective, observational study",2020-03-30,"BACKGROUND: Clinical supervision in general practice is critical for enabling registrars (GP trainees) to provide safe medical care, develop skills and enjoy primary care careers. However, this largely depends on the quality of supervision provided. There has been limited research describing what encompasses quality within GP clinical supervision, making it difficult to promote best practice. This study aimed to explore the attributes of high-quality clinical supervision for GP registrars. METHODS: In 2019–20, 22 semi-structured interviews were conducted with GP supervisors who were peer-nominated as best practice supervisors, by Regional GP Training Organisations and GP Colleges in Australia. Purposeful sampling sought respondents with diverse characteristics including gender and career stage, practice size, state/territory and rurality. Interviews were conducted by video-consultation and recorded. De-identified transcripts were independently coded using iterative, inductive thematic analyses to derive themes that reflected quality in GP supervision. RESULTS: Seven themes emerged. Participants understood the meaning of quality supervision based on their experience of being supervised when they were a registrar, and from reflecting and learning from other supervisors and their own supervision experiences. Quality was reflected by actively structuring GP placements to optimise all possible learning opportunities, building a secure and caring relationship with registrars as the basis for handling challenging situations such as registrar mistakes. Quality also encompassed sustaining and enhancing registrar learning by drawing on the input of the whole practice team who had different skills and supervision approaches. Strong learner-centred approaches were used, where supervisors adjusted support and intervention in real-time, as registrar competence emerged in different areas. Quality also involved building the registrar’s professional identity and capabilities for safe and independent decision-making and encouraging registrars to reflect on situations before giving quality feedback, to drive learning. CONCLUSIONS: This study, although exploratory, provides a foundation for understanding the quality of clinical supervision in general practice, from the perspective of peer-recognised GP supervisors. Understanding and adopting quality within GP supervision may be improved by GPs sharing exemplars of best practice and having opportunities for professional reflection. The findings could be used as a point of reference for devising GP supervisor curriculum, resources and professional development activities.","O’Sullivan, Belinda; Hickson, Helen; Kippen, Rebecca; Wallace, Glen",BMC Med Educ,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12909-021-02882-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34416905/,402

Here, we report the processes and findings of bronchoscopy in a patient with COVID-19 accompanied by respiratory failure. CASE SUMMARY: A 65-year-old male patient was admitted to the Hainan General Hospital on February 3, 2020 for fever and shortness of breath for 13 d that worsened for the last 2 d. The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 nucleic acid test was positive. Routine blood examination on February 28 showed a white blood cell count of 11.02 × 10(9)/L, 86.9% of neutrophils, 6.4% of lymphocytes, absolute lymphocyte count of 0.71 × 10(9)/L, procalcitonin of 2.260 ng/mL, and C-reactive protein of 142.61 mg/L. Oxygen saturation was 46% at baseline and turned to 94% after ventilation. The patient underwent video bronchoscopy. The tracheal cartilage ring was clear, and no deformity was found in the lumen. The trachea and bilateral bronchi were patent, while the mucosa was with slight hyperemia; no neoplasm or ulcer was found. Moderate amounts of white gelatinous secretions were found in the dorsal segment of the left inferior lobe, and the bronchial lumen was patent after sputum aspiration. The right inferior lobe was found with hyperemia and mucosal erosion, with white gelatinous secretion attachment. The patient’s condition did not improve after the application of therapeutic bronchoscopy. CONCLUSION: For patients with COVID-19 and respiratory failure, bronchoscopy can be performed under mechanical ventilation to clarify the airway conditions. Protection should be worn during the process. Considering the risk of infection, it is not necessary to perform bronchoscopy in the mild to moderate COVID-19 patients.","Chen, Qing-Yun; He, Yu-Sheng; Liu, Kai; Cao, Jing; Chen, Yong-Xing",World J Clin Cases,https://doi.org/10.12998/wjcc.v9.i5.1132; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33644177/,402

There is a paucity of data on perceived high risk of COVID-19 and associated factors in Ethiopia. We sought to assess the prevalence of community’s perceived high risk about COVID-19 infections and associated factors among Gondar town community. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was carried out from April 20 to 27, 2020 in Gondar town community, Northwest Ethiopia. Multistage cluster sampling technique was used to recruit 635 participants. Structured and pre-tested questionnaire was used to collect the data. Descriptive statistics, bivariate and multivariable binary logistic regression were used to summarize the results. RESULTS: A total of 623 participants were considered in the analysis with a response rate of 98.1%. The prevalence of coronavirus high risk perceptions of the respondents was found to be 23.11% (95% CI; 19.80%–26.43%).

The aim of our study was to evaluate the diagnostic performance of urinary gluten immunogenic peptides (GIP) determination to detect gluten contamination of the GFD. METHODS: In study A, 25 healthy adults on a standard GFD performed 6 gluten challenges (0, 10, 50, 100, 500, and 1,000 mg) with quantification of urinary GIP before (T(0)) and during the following 24 hours. In study B, 12 participants on a gluten contamination elimination diet underwent urinary GIP determination at T(0) and after challenge with 5 or 10 mg gluten. Urine GIP concentration was determined by an immunochromatographic assay. RESULTS: In study A, 51 of 150 baseline urine samples were GIP+ on GFD and 7 of 17 were GIP+ after the zero-gluten challenge, whereas only 55 of 81 were GIP+ after the 10–1,000 mg gluten challenges. There was no significant change in the 24-hour urinary GIP when increasing gluten from 10 to 1,000 mg. In study B, 24 of 24 baseline urine samples were GIP−, whereas 8 of 24 were GIP+ after 5 or 10 mg of gluten. DISCUSSION: Traces of gluten in the standard GFD may cause positivity of urinary GIP determination, whereas a false negativity is common after a gluten intake of 10–1,000 mg. Owing to the impossibility of standardizing the test in normal conditions, it seems unlikely that urinary GIP determination may represent a reliable tool to assess the compliance to the GFD of patients with celiac disease or other gluten-related disorders.","Monachesi, Chiara; Verma, Anil K.; Catassi, Giulia N.; Franceschini, Elisa; Gatti, Simona; Gesuita, Rosaria; Lionetti, Elena; Catassi, Carlo",Clin Transl Gastroenterol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34613954/; https://doi.org/10.14309/ctg.0000000000000411,402

A significant proportion of such patients were noted to be hypokalemic. Hypokalemia can be life threatening as it is known to cause cardiac arrhythmia. CASE PRESENTATION: Our encounter with said presentation was incidental. The on-call medical team was involved in a cardiac arrest call for a 74-year -old gentleman who developed torsades de pointes, Retrospective analysis of the clinical picture pointed out the fact that he was found to be persistently hypokalemic and bradycardic solely triggered as a result of COVID-19. CONCLUSION: Although initially thought to be a pulmonary disease but along with time extra-pulmonary manifestations of Covid-19 has demonstrated significant consequences. Electrolyte abnormalities and cardiac dysfunction are examples of such extra-pulmonary pathologies. Therefore, it is important to keep close monitoring for such abnormalities otherwise could lead into life threatening arrythmias.","Navid Siddiqui, Saquib; Memon, Muhammad; Tshering, Sonam; Hasan, Tanveer; Jawed, Asheer; Kumar Jha, Pranav; Jayasekhar, Roland",Ann Med Surg (Lond),https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2049080121003666?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34075320/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.amsu.2021.102416; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2049080121003666,402

It is a common cause of abnormal vaginal discharge and is associated with other health issues. Since the first description of anaerobic microbes associated with BV like Gardnerella vaginalis in the 1950s, researchers have stepped up the game by incorporating advanced molecular tools to monitor and evaluate the extent of dysbiosis within the vaginal microbiome, particularly on how specific microbial population changes compared to a healthy state. Moreover, treatment failure and BV recurrence rate remain high despite the standard antibiotic treatment. Consequently, researchers have been probing into alternative or adjunct treatments, including probiotics or even vaginal microbiota transplants, to ensure successful treatment outcomes and reduce the colonization by pathogenic microbes of the female reproductive tract.

Contrary to hepatitis B and C, hepatitis E is mostly a mild infection, although it has a high mortality in pregnant women and can evolve to chronicity in immunocompromised patients. Ribavirin and pegylated interferon-α are the only available therapies, but both have side effects that are not acceptable for prophylaxis or treatment of mild infections. In addition, these drugs cannot be used for all patient types (e.g. in case of pregnancy, specific organ transplants or co-morbidities) and in resource-poor settings. Hence there is an urgent need for better antiviral treatments that are efficacious and safe, also during pregnancy.

PURPOSE: To examine the ethical challenges encountered by nurses caring for patients with the novel coronavirus pneumonia (COVID-19) and to provide nurses with suggestions and support regarding promotion of their mental health. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHOD: A qualitative study was carried out using a qualitative content analysis. The participants were 18 nurses who agreed to attend an interview and describe their own experiences of providing care to COVID-19 patients in China. They were purposively sampled, and structured, in-depth interviews were performed. Data were iteratively collected and analyzed from February to March 2020. ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS: The proposal was approved by the Research Ethics Committee of the Second Hospital of Shandong University, China. FINDINGS: The findings revealed three main themes and 10 categories. The themes were the following: (1) ethical challenges (people with COVID-19, inequality, professional ethics, and job competency); (2) coping styles (active control and planning, seeking support as well as catharsis, and staying focused); and (3) impacts on career (specialized nursing skills, scientific research ability, and management skills).

The expression of TMPRSS2 and its fusion gene, which are increased in the epithelium of the human prostate gland during prostate carcinogenesis, are regulated by androgens. Our goal was to assess the risk of the SARS-CoV-2 infection and the severity of the disease in PCa patients treated with androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). METHODS: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis according to PRISMA guidelines. We queried PubMed and Web of Science databases on 1 July 2021. We used random- and/or fixed-effects meta-analytic models in the presence or absence of heterogeneity according to Cochrane’s Q test and I(2) statistic, respectively. RESULTS: Six retrospective studies (n = 50,220 patients) were selected after considering inclusion and exclusion criteria for qualitative evidence synthesis. Four retrospective studies were included to assess the SARS-CoV-2 infection risk in PCa patients under ADT vs. no ADT and the summarized risk ratio (RR) was 0.8 (95% confidence intervals (CI) 0.44–1.47). Five retrospective studies were included to assess the severity of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in PCa patients under ADT versus no ADT and the summarized RR was 1.23 (95% CI 0.9–1.68). CONCLUSION: We found a non-significant association between the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 severity in PCa patients treated with ADT.

Although there is no clear evidence that pregnancy increases the risk of COVID-19, it is thought that susceptibility to infection and the intensification of respiratory symptoms may be increased, given the physiological changes in pregnancy and increased mortality and morbidity in many viral diseases. Accordingly, the management of COVID-19 in pregnant patients and those considered among the high-risk groups represent a challenge for clinicians. Numerous studies of COVID-19 have been published to date or are ongoing, yet pregnant women are generally excluded from clinical studies. Clinical experiences and case reports occupy an important position in literature, and we present hare a case in which the diagnosis of a patient being followed by our clinic was delayed due to the absence of SARS CoV-2 in recurrent upper-respiratory-tract sampling, and whose clinical findings worsened with initial COVID-19 treatment during pregnancy.

Recent studies have shown that TMPRSS2 expressed on cell surface of host cells could play a crucial role in activation of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) spike protein which facilitates the rapid early entry of the virus into host cells. In addition, direct suppression of TMPRSS2 using small drug inhibitors has been demonstrated to be effective in decreasing SARS-CoV-2 infection in vitro, which presents TMPRSS2 protease as a potential therapeutic strategy for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Recently, SARS-CoV-2 has been shown to be capable of infecting gastrointestinal enterocytes and to provoke gastrointestinal disorders in patients with COVID-19 disease, which is considered as a new transmission route and target organ of SARS-CoV-2. In this review, we highlight the biochemical properties of TMPRSS2 protease and discuss the potential targeting of TMPRSS2 by inhibitors to prevent the SARS-CoV-2 spreading through gastro-intestinal tract system as well as the hurdles that need to be overcome.","Mahmoud, Ismail Sami; Jarrar, Yazun Bashir",Mol Biol Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34023987/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s11033-021-06390-1,402

This study aims to assess the prevalence of excessive weight, underweight, and associated knowledge and lifestyle behaviors among private school-going adolescents in Delhi. A cross-sectional study was conducted in students (6th–7th grades) of eight randomly selected private schools in Delhi, India in 2019. A self-administered survey was used to assess students’ dietary-and-physical-activity-related knowledge and behavior. Anthropometric measurements (height, weight, and waist circumference) were also conducted. Out of 1567 participants, 7.2% were underweight, 61.3% normal, and 31.5% excess in weight. Underweight was associated with significantly more eating whilst studying for exams (relative risk ratio (RRR) 1.7 (1.0–2.9)). Excessive weight was associated with less incorrect knowledge on behaviors causing overweight (RRR 0.7 (0.5–0.9)), more often reading nutritional labels of packed food items (RRR 0.6 (0.4–0.9)), and less frequent vegetable-intake (RRR 0.7 (0.4–0.9)). Underweight students showed more suboptimal knowledge and unhealthy behaviors, whilst students with excessive weight showed more correct knowledge and healthy behaviors. This study highlights the immediate need for effective health-promoting interventions focused on the importance of healthy lifestyle at least in underweight adolescents.","Rawal, Tina; Willeboordse, Maartje; Arora, Monika; Sharma, Nitika; Nazar, Gaurang P.; Tandon, Nikhil; van Schayck, Constant P.",Nutrients,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34579174/; https://doi.org/10.3390/nu13093296,402

We studied the effect of neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (MAb) against IL-17A in our model of mouse MHV-A59-infection. MAb anti-IL-17F and anti-IFNγ were used to complement the study. Results showed that transaminase levels markedly decreased in MHV-A59-infected mice treated with MAb anti-IL-17A whereas plasmatic Ig concentration sharply increased. Conversely, MAb anti-IL-17F enhanced transaminase liberation and did not affect Ig levels. Serum IFNγ was detected in mice infected with MHV-A59 and its concentration increased after MAb anti-IL-17A administration. Besides, MAb anti-IFNγ greatly augmented transaminase plasmatic levels. IL-17A neutralization did not affect MHV-A59-induction of HMGB1 liberation and slightly augmented plasmatic uric acid concentration. However, mice treated with the MAb failed to produce autoAb to FAH. The above results suggest a reciprocal regulation of Th1 and Th17 cells acting on the different MHV-A59 effects. In addition, it is proposed that IL-17A is involved in alarmins adjuvant effects leading to autoAb expression.","Aparicio, José L.; Ottobre, Macarena; Duhalde Vega, Maite; Coutelier, Jean-Paul; Van Snick, Jacques; Retegui, Lilia A.",Eur Cytokine Netw,https://doi.org/10.1684/ecn.2017.0399; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29187338/,402
599097,Visual scoring of chest CT at hospital admission predicts hospitalization time and intensive care admission in Covid-19,2021-04-13,"BACKGROUND: Physicians are increasingly using point of care lung ultrasound (LUS) for diagnosing pneumonia, especially in critical situations as it represents relatively easy and immediately available tool. They also used it in many associated pathological conditions such as consolidation, pleural effusion, and interstitial syndrome with some reports of more accuracy than chest X-ray. This systematic review and meta-analysis are aimed to estimate the pooled diagnostic accuracy of ultrasound for the diagnosis of pneumonia versus the standard chest radiological imaging. METHODS AND MAIN RESULTS: A systematic literature search was conducted for all published studies comparing the diagnostic accuracy of LUS against a reference Chest radiological exam (C X-ray or Chest computed Tomography CT scan), combined with clinical criteria for pneumonia in all age groups. Eligible studies were required to have a Chest X-ray and/or CT scan at the time of clinical evaluation. The authors extracted qualitative and quantitative information from eligible studies, and calculated pooled sensitivity and specificity and pooled positive/negative likelihood ratios (LR). Twenty studies containing 2513 subjects were included in this meta-analysis. The pooled estimates for lung ultrasound in the diagnosis of pneumonia were, respectively, as follows: Overall pooled sensitivity and specificity for diagnosis of pneumonia by lung ultrasound were 0.85 (0.84–0.87) and 0.93 (0.92–0.95), respectively. Overall pooled positive and negative LRs were 11.05 (3.76–32.50) and 0.08 (0.04–0.15), pooled diagnostic Odds ratio was 173.64 (38.79–777.35), and area under the pooled ROC (AUC for SROC) was 0.978. CONCLUSION: Point of care lung ultrasound is an accurate tool for the diagnosis of pneumonia. Considering being easy, readily availability, low cost, and free from radiological hazards, it can be considered as important diagnostic strategy in this condition.","Alzahrani, Saeed Ali; Al-Salamah, Majid Abdulatief; Al-Madani, Wedad Hussain; Elbarbary, Mahmoud A.",Crit Ultrasound J,https://doi.org/10.1186/s13089-017-0059-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28244009/,402

599724,Pancreatic injury in the course of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19): a not‐so‐rare occurrence,2020-06-04,"The current hype associated with machine learning and artificial intelligence often confuses scientists and students and may lead to uncritical or inappropriate applications of computational approaches. Even the field of computer-aided drug design (CADD) is not an exception. The situation is ambivalent. On one hand, more scientists are becoming aware of the benefits of learning from available data and are beginning to derive predictive models before designing experiments. However, on the other hand, easy accessibility of in silico tools comes at the risk of using them as “black boxes” without sufficient expert knowledge, leading to widespread misconceptions and problems. For example, results of computations may be taken at face value as “nothing but the truth” and data visualization may be used only to generate “pretty and colorful pictures”. Computational experts might come to the rescue and help to re-direct such efforts, for example, by guiding interested novices to conduct meaningful data analysis, make scientifically sound predictions, and communicate the findings in a rigorous manner. However, this is not always ensured. This contribution aims to encourage investigators entering the CADD arena to obtain adequate computational training, communicate or collaborate with experts, and become aware of the fundamentals of computational methods and their given limitations, beyond the hype. By its very nature, this Opinion is partly subjective and we do not attempt to provide a comprehensive guide to the best practices of CADD; instead, we wish to stimulate an open discussion within the scientific community and advocate rational rather than fashion-driven use of computational methods. We take advantage of the open peer-review culture of F1000Research such that reviewers and interested readers may engage in this discussion and obtain credits for their candid personal views and comments. We hope that this open discussion forum will contribute to shaping the future practice of CADD.","Medina-Franco, José L.; Martinez-Mayorga, Karina; Fernández-de Gortari, Eli; Kirchmair, Johannes; Bajorath, Jürgen",F1000Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34164109/; https://doi.org/10.12688/f1000research.52676.1,402

Similar compounds, which are embedded to proximate points on the 2D map, may bind the same or similar target proteins. Thus, iBioProVis can be used to easily observe the structural distribution of one or two target proteins’ known ligands on the 2D compound space, and to infer new binders to the same protein, or to infer new potential target(s) for a compound of interest, based on this distribution. Principal component analysis (PCA) projection of the input compounds is also provided, Hence the user can interactively observe the same compound or a group of selected compounds which is projected by both PCA and embedded by t-SNE. iBioProVis also provides detailed information about drugs and drug candidate compounds through cross-references to widely used and well-known databases, in the form of linked table views. Two use-case studies were demonstrated, one being on angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) protein which is Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) Spike protein receptor. ACE2 binding compounds and seven antiviral drugs were closely embedded in which two of them have been under clinical trial for Coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19).

There are limited data on COVID-19 patients in Vietnam. The paper examined and compared epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19 patients in Vietnam. Methods. The data was obtained using publicly available information from the official website of Vietnam Ministry of Health covering a period of 01/23/2020 to 05/27/2020. T-test, Chi-square test and Fishers Exact test were utilized to compare characteristics of COVID-19 patients between under-treatment and discharge groups and between overseas and non-overseas travel groups. Results. Vietnam had a total of 327 cases of COVID-19 as of May 27, 2020. The median age of patients was 30 years (ranging from 3 months to 88 years). About 68% of patients (n=223) had acquired the disease outside the country while 32% were infected within the country. Among those infected inside the country, 66% were women. Men were more likely than women to be infected from overseas (p<0.001). Younger patients were significantly associated with international travel (p=.001). While patients in the South reported highest levels of overseas travel history (77.9%), those (100%) in the Central reporting the highest level of being discharged (p<0.001). Women (54.7%) had a higher rate of discharge compared to men (45.3%) [p<0.001]. Nearly 86% have recovered and discharged from hospitals. There has been no reported fatality. Conclusion. A majority of COVID-19 cases in Vietnam were acquired from abroad. A significantly higher number of women than men were infected inside the country calling for further research about gender disparities in the fight against COVID-19 in Vietnam.","Ha, Toan H; Ruano, Gualberto; Lewis, Judy",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.06.03.20121467; http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.06.03.20121467v1?rss=1,402

The gold-standard sleep assessment uses polysomnography (PSG) with various sensors to identify sleep patterns and disorders. However, due to the high cost of PSG and limited availability, many people with sleep disorders are left undiagnosed. Recent wearable sensors and electronics enable portable, continuous monitoring of sleep at home, overcoming the limitations of PSG. This report reviews the advances in wearable sensors, miniaturized electronics, and system packaging for home sleep monitoring. New devices available in the market and systems are collectively summarized based on their overall structure, form factor, materials, and sleep assessment method.

Experts recommend CT imaging as a diagnostic tool because of the weak points of the nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT). In this study, the detection of COVID-19 from CT images, which give the most accurate response in a short time, was investigated in the classical computer and firstly in quantum computers. Using the quantum transfer learning method, we experimentally perform COVID-19 detection in different quantum real processors (IBMQx2, IBMQ London and IBMQ-Rome) of IBM, as well as in different simulators (Pennylane, Qiskit-Aer and Cirq). By using a small number of data sets such as 126 COVID-19 and 100 Normal CT images, we obtained a positive or negative classification of COVID-19 with 90% success in classical computers, while we achieved a high success rate of 94-100% in quantum computers. Also, according to the results obtained, machine learning process in classical computers requiring more processors and time than quantum computers can be realized in a very short time with a very small quantum processor such as 4 qubits in quantum computers. If the size of the data set is small; Due to the superior properties of quantum, it is seen that according to the classification of COVID-19 and Normal, in terms of machine learning, quantum computers seem to outperform traditional computers.","Acar, E.; Yilmaz, I.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.11.07.20227306v1?rss=1; https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.11.07.20227306,402

Adverse health, social and economic effects of the pandemic have triggered an urgency among policy makers to seek an effective panacea. In this commentary, we examine the covert outbreak of a demand for alternative remedies with limited scientific evidence on their effectiveness to manage COVID-19 in Africa. Similar demands have been displayed in previous epidemics, though the ubiquity of social media in this current clime fuels such demands even more. We describe the attendant consequences of this demand surge on ongoing public health efforts to mitigate the spread of COVID-19 and highlight its future repercussions which may continue to plague health systems beyond the present outbreak. Going forward, governments must be proactive in surveillance of this covert epidemic, actively engage community influencers in knowledge transfer and implement targeted health promotion interventions.","Eboreime, Ejemai Amaize; Iwu, Chinwe Juliana; Banke-Thomas, Aduragbemi",Pan Afr Med J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33282063/; https://doi.org/10.11604/pamj.supp.2020.35.24728,402

In contrast, very little is known about the viral proteins. In the present report we have identified the membrane glycoprotein (M) of PEDV by use of rabbit anti-peptide sera and transient expression of the cloned M gene in Vero cells and by expression in the baculovirus system. The native M protein of PEDV is incorporated into virions, is N-glycosylated, and migrates with a relative mobility (Mr) of 27 k in polyacrylamide gels. In contrast, the M protein synthesized by recombinant baculoviruses migrates with a Mr of 23 k, that is, with identical mobility as the deglycosylated product of PEDV. Thus, it appears that M protein specified by the recombinant baculovirus is poorly, if at all, glycosylated. Using monoclonal antibodies and rabbit antipeptide sera specific for the N and C termini of the M protein, we were able to show that a 19 k band detected in PEDV-infected cells but not in virions represented a fragment of M from which the C terminus had been cleaved off. Finally, by electron microscopy and immunogold labelling, the relative orientation of M within the virion envelope was determined as NexoCcyt. In conclusion, all of these data strongly support the hypothesis that PEDV should be classified with the group I coronaviruses.","Utiger, Anna; Tobler, Kurt; Bridgen, Anne; Ackermann, Mathias",Virus Genes,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8560773/,402

We show that purely mathematical procedures for site selection should be supervised by known phylogeny (i) to ensure that solid tree branches are represented instead of mutational hotspots with poor phylogeographic proprieties, and (ii) to avoid phylogenetic redundancy. We propose a procedure that prevents information redundancy in site selection by considering the cumulative informativeness of previously selected sites (as a proxy for phylogenetic-based criteria). This procedure demonstrates that, for short barcodes (e.g., 11 sites), there are thousands of informative site combinations that improve previous proposals. We also show that barcodes based on worldwide databases inevitably prioritize variants located at the basal nodes of the phylogeny, such that most representative genomes in these ancestral nodes are no longer in circulation. Consequently, coronavirus phylodynamics cannot be properly captured by universal genomic barcodes because most SARS-CoV-2 variation is generated in geographically restricted areas by the continuous introduction of domestic variants.","Pardo-Seco, Jacobo; Gómez-Carballa, Alberto; Bello, Xabier; Martinón-Torres, Federico; Salas, Antonio",Zool Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33410308/; https://doi.org/10.24272/j.issn.2095-8137.2020.364,402

However, the role of neutrophils in EH is still elusive. We investigated the association between angiotensin II (Ang II) and neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) in pathogenesis of EH. Plasma samples, kidney biopsies, and surgical specimens of abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) from patients with EH were used. Cell-based assays, NETs/human aortic endothelial cell cocultures, and in situ studies were performed. Increased plasma levels of NETs and tissue factor (TF) activity were detected in untreated, newly diagnosed patients with EH. Stimulation of control neutrophils with plasma from patients with untreated EH generated TF-enriched NETs promoting endothelial collagen production. Ang II induced NETosis in vitro via an ROS/peptidylarginine deiminase type 4 and autophagy-dependent pathway. Circulating NETs and thrombin generation levels were reduced substantially in patients with EH starting treatment with Ang II receptor blockers, whereas their plasma was unable to trigger procoagulant NETs. Moreover, TF-bearing NETotic neutrophils/remnants accumulated in sites of interstitial renal fibrosis and in the subendothelial layer of AAAs. These data reveal the important pathogenic role of an Ang II/ROS/NET/TF axis in EH, linking thromboinflammation with endothelial dysfunction and fibrosis.","Chrysanthopoulou, Akrivi; Gkaliagkousi, Eugenia; Lazaridis, Antonios; Arelaki, Stella; Pateinakis, Panagiotis; Ntinopoulou, Maria; Mitsios, Alexandros; Antoniadou, Christina; Argyriou, Christos; Georgiadis, George S.; Papadopoulos, Vasileios; Giatromanolaki, Alexandra; Ritis, Konstantinos; Skendros, Panagiotis",JCI insight,https://doi.org/10.1172/jci.insight.148668; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34324440/,402

In addition, uncertainties in knowledge must be named transparently; irrational fears and rumours must be refuted. Success factors for risk communication are the participation of citizens as well as the continuous recording of risk perception and risk competence in population groups. The current COVID-19 (corona virus disease 2019) pandemic poses specific challenges for risk communication. The state of knowledge on many important aspects concerning COVID-19 was and is often uncertain or preliminary, e.g. on transmission, symptoms, long-term effects and immunity. Communication is characterised by scientific language and an array of figures and statistics, which can render the content difficult to understand. Alongside the official announcements and statements by experts, COVID-19 is widely communicated on social media, spreading misinformation and speculation; this “infodemic” can complicate risk communication. Various national and international scientific projects will help tailor risk communication on COVID-19 to target groups and thereby render it more effective. These projects include explorative studies on how people deal with COVID-19-related information; the COVID-19 Snapshot Monitoring (COSMO) project, a regularly conducted online survey on risk perception and protective behaviour; and an interdisciplinary qualitative study that compares the design, implementation and effectiveness of risk communication strategies in four countries.","Loss, Julika; Boklage, Evgeniya; Jordan, Susanne; Jenny, Mirjam A.; Weishaar, Heide; El Bcheraoui, Charbel",Bundesgesundheitsblatt Gesundheitsforschung Gesundheitsschutz,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00103-021-03283-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33564896/,402

The Health Check includes calculation of CVD risk and discussion of pharmacological and lifestyle approaches to manage risk, including referral to lifestyle support services. The programme is commissioned by Local Authorities (LAs) and is delivered by a range of different providers in different settings. There is significant variation in activity, with uptake ranging from 25% to 85% in different areas, and clear evidence of variation in implementation and delivery practice. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: We aim to understand how the NHS Health Check programme works in different settings, for different groups, so that we can recommend improvements to maximise intended outcomes. To do so, we will undertake a realist review and a survey of LA public health teams. Our review will follow Pawson’s five iterative stages: (1) locate existing theories, (2) search for evidence, (3) article selection, (4) extract and organise data and (5) synthesise evidence and draw conclusions. Our review will include documents describing local implementation alongside published research studies. We will recruit a stakeholder group (including Public Health England, commissioners and providers of Health Checks, plus members of the public and patients) to advise us throughout. Our survey will be sent to all 152 LAs in England to gather detailed information on programme delivery (including COVID-19-related changes) and available referral services. This will enable us to map delivery across England and relate these data to programme outcomes. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethical approval is not required for this review. For the survey, we have received approval from the University of Kent Research Ethics Committee.

From adversity, opportunities have arisen to measure the state and dynamics of human disease at a scale not seen before. In the United Kingdom, the evidence that wastewater could be used to monitor the SARS-CoV-2 virus prompted the development of National wastewater surveillance programmes. The scale and pace of this work has proven to be unique in monitoring of virus dynamics at a national level, demonstrating the importance of wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) for public health protection. Beyond COVID-19, it can provide additional value for monitoring and informing on a range of biological and chemical markers of human health. A discussion of measurement uncertainty associated with surveillance of wastewater, focusing on lessons-learned from the UK programmes monitoring COVID-19 is presented, showing that sources of uncertainty impacting measurement quality and interpretation of data for public health decision-making, are varied and complex. While some factors remain poorly understood, we present approaches taken by the UK programmes to manage and mitigate the more tractable sources of uncertainty.

METHODS: A cross-sectional online survey of 78 questions investigating social determinants of health, mood changes, symptoms of anxiety, increase in sleep disorders and unusual repetitive movements was offered to parents living in Italy with children ≤18 years; including families of children with disabilities, autism spectrum disorders, chronic diseases, and specific learning disabilities. The survey was conducted on the Qualtrics platform 6 months after the beginning of the pandemic and distributed in hospitals and paediatricians’ waiting rooms as well as through social networks. The primary outcomes were the increase in sleep disorders among children and adolescents. Possible risk factors were investigated through multivariable regression. RESULTS: Six thousand two hundred ten volunteer parents responded to the questions concerning mood changes, sleep disorders and unusual repetitive movements, and were included in the present study. The majority were female (91.8%) and Italian (97.0%). 72.7% answered that their children had become more nervous, worried, or sad (80.2% in children with learning disabilities); 77.6% reported feelings of loneliness and 69.3% more difficulties in children falling asleep, 30.2% in staying asleep, and 18.7% an increase in nightmares and/or sleep terrors. Statistical analysis identified socioeconomic status, parent’s job loss, food insecurity, family attitude toward the pandemic, and children’s mood swing, feelings of loneliness, or missing outdoor activities, as major risk factors for sleep disorders. CONCLUSION: The first Covid-19 lockdown impacted children’s and adolescents’ health through an increase in sleep disorders. In the following phases of the pandemic, this evidence may be useful to investigate and treat these disorders as well as make decisions about containment health policies concerning this age group.

Due to hospital closure, a lot of consulting services have been moved online. Because of the shortage of medical professionals, many people cannot receive online consultations timely. To address this problem, we aim to develop a medical dialogue system that can provide COVID19-related consultations. We collected two dialogue datasets - CovidDialog - (in English and Chinese respectively) containing conversations between doctors and patients about COVID-19. On these two datasets, we train several dialogue generation models based on Transformer, GPT, and BERT-GPT. Since the two COVID-19 dialogue datasets are small in size, which bear high risk of overfitting, we leverage transfer learning to mitigate data deficiency. Specifically, we take the pretrained models of Transformer, GPT, and BERT-GPT on dialog datasets and other large-scale texts, then finetune them on our CovidDialog datasets. Experiments demonstrate that these approaches are promising in generating meaningful medical dialogue about COVID-19.

All types of drugs, such as essential life-saving drugs, oncology medicines, antimicrobial drugs, analgesics, opioids, cardiovascular drugs, radiopharmaceutical, and parenteral products, are liable to the shortage. Among all pharmaceutical dosage forms, sterile injectable products have a higher risk of shortage than other forms. The causes of shortage are multifactorial, including supply issues, demand issues, and regulatory issues. Supply issues consist of manufacturing problems, unavailability of raw materials, logistic problems, and business problems. In contrast, demand issues include just-in-time inventory, higher demand for a product, seasonal demand, and unpredictable demand. For regulatory issues, one important factor is the lack of a unified definition of drug shortage. Drug shortage affects all stakeholders from economic, clinical, and humanistic aspects.

We applied a Cox proportional hazards model with propensity score matching to estimate the effect of these treatments on clinical improvement by 28 days (discharge or a 2-point decrease in WHO severity score) and 28-day mortality. Measurements and Main Results: Of 2485 COVID-19 patients admitted between March 4 and August 29, 2020, 342 received remdesivir and 157 received remdesivir plus dexamethasone. Median age was 60 years; 45% were female; 81% were non-white. Remdesivir recipients on room air or nasal cannula oxygen had a faster time to clinical improvement (median 5.0 days [IQR 4.0, 8.0], remdesivir vs. 7.0 days [IQR 5.0, 12.0], control; adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) 1.55 [1.28; 1.87]), yet those requiring higher levels of respiratory support did not benefit. Remdesivir recipients had lower, but statistically insignificant, 28-day mortality (7.6% [23 deaths], remdesivir vs. 14.9% [45 deaths], control). Adding dexamethasone trended toward lower 28-day mortality compared to remdesivir alone (5.1% [8 deaths] vs. 9.2% [17 deaths]; aHR 0.14 [0.02; 1.03]). Conclusions: Remdesivir offered a significantly faster time to clinical improvement among a cohort of predominantly non-white patients hospitalized with COVID-19, particularly with mild-moderate disease. Remdesivir plus dexamethasone may reduce mortality.","Garibaldi, B. T.; Wang, K.; Robinson, M. L.; Zeger, S. L.; Bandeen Roche, K.; Wang, M.-C.; Alexander, G.

608193,C-reactive protein and thyroid-stimulating hormone levels as risk factors for hypothyroidism in patients with subacute thyroiditis,2021-07-21,"Inhibition of the binding of enveloped viruses surface glycoproteins to host cell receptor(s) is a major target of vaccines and constitutes an efficient strategy to block viral entry and infection of various host cells and tissues. Cellular entry usually requires the fusion of the viral envelope with host plasma membranes. Such entry mechanism is often preceded by “priming” and/or “activation” steps requiring limited proteolysis of the viral surface glycoprotein to expose a fusogenic domain for efficient membrane juxtapositions. The 9-membered family of Proprotein Convertases related to Subtilisin/Kexin (PCSK) serine proteases (PC1, PC2, Furin, PC4, PC5, PACE4, PC7, SKI-1/S1P, and PCSK9) participate in post-translational cleavages and/or regulation of multiple secretory proteins. The type-I membrane-bound Furin and SKI-1/S1P are the major convertases responsible for the processing of surface glycoproteins of enveloped viruses. Stefan Kunz has considerably contributed to define the role of SKI-1/S1P in the activation of arenaviruses causing hemorrhagic fever. Furin was recently implicated in the activation of the spike S-protein of SARS-CoV-2 and Furin-inhibitors are being tested as antivirals in COVID-19. Other members of the PCSK-family are also implicated in some viral infections, such as PCSK9 in Dengue. Herein, we summarize the various functions of the PCSKs and present arguments whereby their inhibition could represent a powerful arsenal to limit viral infections causing the present and future pandemics.","Seidah, Nabil G.; Pasquato, Antonella; Andréo, Ursula",Viruses,https://doi.org/10.3390/v13071229; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34202098/,402

608664,The platelet paradox of injury versus protection in myocardial infarction—has it been overlooked?,2021-05-26,"BACKGROUND: The aim of this was to analyze 4 chest CT imaging features of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Shenzhen, China so as to improve the diagnosis of COVID-19. METHODS: Chest CT of 34 patients with COVID-19 confirmed by the nucleic acid test (NAT) were retrospectively analyzed. Analyses were performed to investigate the pathological basis of four imaging features(“feather sign”,“dandelion sign”,“pomegranate sign”, and “rime sign”) and to summarize the follow-up results. RESULTS: There were 22 patients (65.2%) with typical “feather sign”and 18 (52.9%) with “dandelion sign”, while few patients had “pomegranate sign” and “rime sign”. The “feather sign” and “dandelion sign” were composed of stripe or round ground-glass opacity (GGO), thickened blood vessels, and small-thickened interlobular septa. The “pomegranate sign” was characterized as follows: the increased range of GGO, the significant thickening of the interlobular septum, complicated with a small amount of punctate alveolar hemorrhage. The “rime sign” was characterized by numerous alveolar edemas. Microscopically, the wall thickening, small vascular proliferation, luminal stenosis, and occlusion, accompanied by interstitial infiltration of inflammatory cells, as well as numerous pulmonary interstitial fibrosis and partial hyaline degeneration were observed. Repeated chest CT revealed the mediastinal lymphadenectasis in one patient. Re-examination of the NAT showed another positive anal swab in two patients. CONCLUSION: “Feather sign” and “dandelion sign” were typical chest CT features in patients withCOVID-19; “pomegranate sign” was an atypical feature, and “rime sign” was a severe feature. In clinical work, accurate identification of various chest CT signs can help to improve the diagnostic accuracy of COVID-19 and reduce the misdiagnosis or missed diagnosis rate.","Jin, Jun; Gao, De-hong; Mo, Xin; Tan, Si-ping; Kou, Zhen-xia; Chen, Yi-bo; Cao, Jin-bo; Chen, Wen-jing; Zhang, Ya-ming; Li, Bing-qing; Huang, Kuan-long; Xu, Bing-ren; Tang, Xiao-li; Wang, Yu-li",BMC Med Imaging,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12880-020-00484-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32703209/,402

Methods and results: Ten patients with a clinical diagnosis of SARS, and virological confirmation of SARS coronavirus infection were identified. Histology in most cases showed diffuse alveolar damage, from early to late phases, and the changes corresponded to the time sequence. Other variable features include multinucleated giant cells, pneumocytes with cytomegaly and variable amounts of inflammatory cells and foamy macrophages. One case showed superimposed bronchopneumonia. No viral inclusions were found. Coronavirus particles were identified in pneumocytes by electron microscopy. Conclusions: The predominant pathological process of SARS is diffuse alveolar damage and, in patients who die from the disease, there is evidence of organization and fibrosis. There are apparently no histological features specific for this disease, and the aetiological diagnosis depends on virological and ultrastructural studies.","Cheung, O Y; Chan, J W M; Ng, C K; Koo, C K",Histopathology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15279629/,402

The current Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic could therefore have a serious impact on the health of people with CF (pwCF). METHODS: We used the 38-country European Cystic Fibrosis Society Patient Registry (ECFSPR) to collect case data about pwCF and SARS-CoV-2 infection. RESULTS: Up to 30 June 2020, 16 countries reported 130 SARS-CoV-2 cases in people with CF, yielding an incidence of 2.70/1000 pwCF. Incidence was higher in lung-transplanted patients (n=23) versus non-transplanted patients (n=107) (8.43 versus 2.36 cases/1000). Incidence was higher in pwCF versus the age-matched general population in the age groups <15, 15-24, and 25-49 years (p<0.001), with similar trends for pwCF with and without lung transplant. Compared to the general population, pwCF (regardless of transplantation status) had significantly higher rates of admission to hospital for all age groups with available data, and higher rates of intensive care, although not statistically significant. Most pwCF recovered (96.2%), however 5 died, of whom 3 were lung transplant recipients. The case fatality rate for pwCF (3.85%, 95% CI: 1.26-8.75) was non-significantly lower than that of the general population (7.46%; p=0.133). CONCLUSIONS: SARS-CoV-2 infection can result in severe illness and death for pwCF, even for younger patients and especially for lung transplant recipients. PwCF should continue to shield from infection and should be prioritized for vaccination.","Lutz, Naehrlich; Annalisa, Orenti; Fiona, Dunlevy; Irena, Kasmi; Satenik, Harutyunyan; Andreas, Pfleger; Vladimir, Bobrovnichy; Svetlana, Keegan; Géraldine, Daneau; Guergana, Petrova; Ivan, Bambir; Andrea, Dugac Vukic; Duška, Tješić-Drinković; Panayiotis, Yiallouros; Pavel, Drevinek; Milan, Macek; Alena, Bilkova; Vebert, Olesen Hanne; Régis, Burgel Pierre-; Harriet, Corvol; Lydie, Lemonnier-Videau; Tsitsino, Parulava; Elpis, Hatziagorou; Filia, Diamantea; Andrea, Párniczky; Godfrey, Fletcher; F, McKone Edward; Meir, Mei-Zahav; Rita, Padoan; Marco, Salvatore; Carla, Colombo; Elina, Aleksejeva; Kestutis, Malakauskas; Marc, Schlesser; Stojka, Fustik; Oxana, Turcu; Vincent, Gulmans; Domenique, Zomer-van Ommen; Anita, Senstad Wathne; Egil, Bakkeheim; Łukasz, Woźniacki; Luísa, Pereira; Liviu, Pop; Elena, Kondratyeva; Elena, Amelina; Elena, Zhekaite; Olga, Simonova; Nataliya, Kashirskaya; Milan, Rodić; Hana, Kayserova; Uros, Krivec; Pedro, Mondejar-Lopez; Dolores, Pastor-Vivero Maria; Isabelle, de Monestrol; Anders, Lindblad; Deniz, Dogru; Gökdemir, Yasemin; Sevgi, Pekcan; Halyna, Makukh; Keith, Brownlee; Rebecca, Cosgriff; Eliott, McClenaghan; Siobhán, Carr; Elise, Lammertyn; Anna, Zolin; Alice, Fox; Marco, Krasnyk; Jacqui, Van Rens; Silke, van Koningsbruggen-Rietschel; Andreas, Jung",J Cyst Fibros,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1569199321000990?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34016559/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1569199321000990; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcf.2021.03.017,402

Of these, 48,557 cases and 2,169 deaths occurred in the epicenter, Wuhan. A key public health priority during the emergence of a novel pathogen is estimating clinical severity, which requires properly adjusting for the case ascertainment rate and the delay between symptoms onset and death. Using public and published information, we estimate that the overall symptomatic case fatality risk (the probability of dying after developing symptoms) of COVID-19 in Wuhan was 1.4% (0.9–2.1%), which is substantially lower than both the corresponding crude or naïve confirmed case fatality risk (2,169/48,557 = 4.5%) and the approximator(1) of deaths/deaths + recoveries (2,169/2,169 + 17,572 = 11%) as of 29 February 2020. Compared to those aged 30–59 years, those aged below 30 and above 59 years were 0.6 (0.3–1.1) and 5.1 (4.2–6.1) times more likely to die after developing symptoms. The risk of symptomatic infection increased with age (for example, at ~4% per year among adults aged 30–60 years).","Wu, Joseph T.; Leung, Kathy; Bushman, Mary; Kishore, Nishant; Niehus, Rene; de Salazar, Pablo M.; Cowling, Benjamin J.; Lipsitch, Marc; Leung, Gabriel M.",Nat Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32284616/; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41591-020-0822-7,402

Serological assays detecting IgG against the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the spike (S) protein are useful to monitor the immune response after infection or vaccination. The objective of our study was to evaluate the clinical performance of the Siemens SARS-CoV-2 IgG (sCOVG) assay. Methods: Sensitivity and specificity of the Siemens sCOVG test were evaluated on 178 patients with SARS-CoV-2-infection and 160 pre-pandemic samples in comparison with its predecessor test COV2G. Furthermore, correlation with virus neutralization titers was investigated on 134 samples of convalescent COVID-19 patients. Results: Specificity of the sCOVG test was 99.4% and sensitivity was 90.5% (COV2G assay 78.7%; p<0.0001). S1-RBD antibody levels showed a good correlation with virus neutralization titers (r=0.843; p<0.0001) and an overall qualitative agreement of 98.5%. Finally, median S1-RBD IgG levels increase with age and were significantly higher in hospitalized COVID-19 patients (median levels general ward: 25.7 U/ml; intensive care: 59.5 U/ml) than in outpatients (3.8 U/ml; p<0.0001). Conclusions: Performance characteristics of the sCOVG assay have been improved compared to the predecessor test COV2G. Quantitative SARS-CoV-2 S1-RBD IgG levels could be used as a surrogate for virus neutralization capacity.

Previous studies indicated that some of those bat SARSr-CoVs have the potential to infect humans5-7. Here we report the identification and characterization of a novel coronavirus (nCoV-2019) which caused an epidemic of acute respiratory syndrome in humans, in Wuhan, China. The epidemic, started from December 12th, 2019, has caused 198 laboratory confirmed infections with three fatal cases by January 20th, 2020. Full-length genome sequences were obtained from five patients at the early stage of the outbreak. They are almost identical to each other and share 79.5% sequence identify to SARS-CoV. Furthermore, it was found that nCoV-2019 is 96% identical at the whole genome level to a bat coronavirus. The pairwise protein sequence analysis of seven conserved non-structural proteins show that this virus belongs to the species of SARSr-CoV. The nCoV-2019 virus was then isolated from the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of a critically ill patient, which can be neutralized by sera from several patients. Importantly, we have confirmed that this novel CoV uses the same cell entry receptor, ACE2, as SARS-CoV.","Zhou, Peng; Yang, Xing-Lou; Wang, Xian-Guang; Hu, Ben; Zhang, Lei; Zhang, Wei; Si, Hao-Rui; Zhu, Yan; Li, Bei; Huang, Chao-Lin; Chen, Hui-Dong; Chen, Jing; Luo, Yun; Guo, Hua; Jiang, Ren-Di; Liu, Mei-Qin; Chen, Ying; Shen, Xu-Rui; Wang, Xi; Zheng, Xiao-Shuang; Zhao, Kai; Chen, Quan-Jiao; Deng, Fei; Liu, Lin-Lin; Yan, Bing; Zhan, Fa-Xian; Wang, Yan-Yi; Xiao, Geng-Fu; Shi, Zheng-Li",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.01.22.914952,402

They are thus in constant natural contact with humans and animals. However, the clinical and technological use of bacteriophages has also become more frequent, which is why all aspects of phage–mammal interactions need to be explored. Bacteriophages are able to interact with mammalian phagocytes. They may inhibit the phagocytosis of bacteria, but they may also undergo phagocytosis themselves. The ability of bacteriophages to reduce reactive oxygen species production by polymorphonuclear leukocytes in the presence of bacteria or their endotoxins was also confirmed. Studies show that the high immunogenicity of bacteriophages may also be employed in anti-tumor treatment. The present knowledge of phage interactions with cellular components of the mammalian immune system is sparse and insufficient, especially considering the increasing interest in the application of these viruses in human life.

611774,Candida spp. co-infection in COVID-19 patients with severe pneumonia: Prevalence study and associated risk factors,2021-09-17,"BACKGROUND: The clinical course of COVID-19 may vary significantly. The presence of comorbidities prolongs the recovery time. The recovery in patients with mild-to-moderate symptoms might take 10 days, while in those with a critical illness or immunocompromised status could take 15 days. Considering the lack of data about predictors that could affect the recovery time, we conducted this study to identify them. METHODS: This cross-sectional study was implemented in the COVID-19 clinic of a teaching and referral university hospital in Tehran. Patients with the highly suggestive symptoms who had computed tomography (CT) imaging results with typical findings of COVID-19 or positive results of reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) were enrolled in the study. Inpatient and outpatient COVID-19 participants were followed up by regular visits or phone calls, and the recovery period was recorded. RESULTS: A total of 478 patients were enrolled. The mean age of patients was 54.11 ± 5.65 years, and 44.2% were female. The median time to recovery was 13.5 days (IQR: 9). Although in the bivariate analysis, multiple factors, including hypertension, fever, diabetes mellitus, gender, and admission location, significantly contributed to prolonging the recovery period, in multivariate analysis, only dyspnea had a significant association with this variable (p = 0.02, the adjusted OR of 2.05; 95% CI 1.12–3.75). CONCLUSION: This study supports that dyspnea is a predictor of recovery time.

The range of application of MR is limited mainly by the need for an accurate search model. In most cases, pre‐existing experimentally determined structures are used as search models. In favorable cases, ab initio predicted structures have yielded search models adequate for MR. The ORF8 protein of SARS‐CoV‐2 represents a challenging case for MR using an ab initio prediction because ORF8 has an all β‐sheet fold and few orthologs. We previously determined experimentally the structure of ORF8 using the single anomalous dispersion (SAD) phasing method, having been unable to find an MR solution to the crystallographic phase problem. Following a report of an accurate prediction of the ORF8 structure, we assessed whether the predicted model would have succeeded as an MR search model. A phase problem solution was found, and the resulting structure was refined, yielding structural parameters equivalent to the original experimental solution.","Flower, Thomas G.; Hurley, James H.",Protein Sci,https://doi.org/10.1002/pro.4050; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33625752/,402

Studies have looked at the entry of SARS‐CoV‐2 into host cells mediated by the viral spike protein and human receptor ACE2. However, less is known about the cellular immune responses triggered by SARS‐CoV‐2 viral proteins. Here, we show that the nucleocapsid of SARS‐CoV‐2 inhibits host pyroptosis by blocking Gasdermin D (GSDMD) cleavage. SARS‐CoV‐2‐infected monocytes show enhanced cellular interleukin‐1β (IL‐1β) expression, but reduced IL‐1β secretion. While SARS‐CoV‐2 infection promotes activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome and caspase‐1, GSDMD cleavage and pyroptosis are inhibited in infected human monocytes. SARS‐CoV‐2 nucleocapsid protein associates with GSDMD in cells and inhibits GSDMD cleavage in vitro and in vivo. The nucleocapsid binds the GSDMD linker region and hinders GSDMD processing by caspase‐1. These insights into how SARS‐CoV‐2 antagonizes cellular inflammatory responses may open new avenues for treating COVID‐19 in the future.","Ma, Juan; Zhu, Fangrui; Zhao, Min; Shao, Fei; Yu, Dou; Ma, Jiangwen; Zhang, Xusheng; Li, Weitao; Qian, Yan; Zhang, Yan; Jiang, Dong; Wang, Shuo; Xia, Pengyan",EMBO J,https://doi.org/10.15252/embj.2021108249; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34296442/,402

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Dentists involved in certain treatments, for example, high-speed drilling procedures, generate infectious aerosols. These Aerosol Generating Procedures (AGPs) are at the highest risk of transmission of coronavirus. During the COVID-19 pandemic, a significant number of dentists in the UK were restricted from providing treatments to reduce the risk of viral transmission. Some of the dentists providing urgent dental treatment were involved in AGPs. Significant and sudden changes in the delivery of dental care in the current pandemic may have impacted the MH of dentists. An online survey was conducted, using validated tools to measure the MH symptoms and stress. Pearson's chi-squared test of independence was used for statistical analysis. RESULTS: Overall, 123 dentists participated in the survey. The prevalence of anxiety-related symptoms was 71% (95% CI 0.62–0.78), depression-related symptoms was 60% (95% CI 0.51–0.68), and stress was 92% (95% CI 0.86–0.96). Dentists working in the independent sector had more psychological symptoms compared with those in the public sector (P = 0.014).

Public protective behaviors and perception play crucial roles in controlling the spread of illness and psychological status. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional online survey in the hardest-hit Hubei province and other areas in China affected by COVID-19 outbreak. Questions about their basic information, the perception of the COVID-19 outbreak, recent preventive or avoidance behaviors, and self-reported mental health scales including the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) and Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS) were included. Binary logistic regressions were used to investigate the association between personal variables/perceptions and psychological distress. RESULTS: 6,261 people were included for analysis, with 3,613 (57.7%) in Hubei province (1,743 in Wuhan). A majority of people have adopted preventive and avoidance behaviors. People from Hubei, with contact history, and people who or whose family members were infected had much higher depression or anxiety prevalence. Providing truthful and sufficient information, informing the public about the severity of the disease, and perceptions that the outbreak will be control by protective behaviors were associated with lower depression and anxiety prevalence. CONCLUSIONS: Assessing the public response, perception, and psychological burden during the outbreak may help improve public health recommendations and deliver timely psychological intervention. Further researches can focus on the psychological status of a specialized group to identify ways for better support based on public response and psychological demand.","Huang, Jing; Liu, Fangkun; Teng, Ziwei; Chen, Jindong; Zhao, Jingping; Wang, Xiaoping; Wu, Ying; Xiao, Jingmei; Wang, Ying; Wu, Renrong",Open Forum Infect Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32817845/; https://doi.org/10.1093/ofid/ofaa273,402
614911,Pulmonary Embolism in COVID-19 Patients: Which Diagnostic Algorithm Should We Use?,2021-08-13,"Despite the growing interest in the treatment and management of COVID-19, communities still end up experiencing multiple stresses with mental health crisis, due to the pandemic. When this is not addressed, it causes stress in the long run, with further mental health damage in individuals and the communities. Furthermore, relevant policy related to the community mental health was identified as awareness in promoting mental issues, yet there are still failures recorded in the aspect of adequately addressing the well-being concerns. This study aims to support community mental health during the crisis, through useful information from relevant articles. It also explains some perspectives from literature reviews, case reports, with society responses from Google Scholar, Science Direct, and Proquest databases concerning recent community mental health issues, and government policy on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. The inclusion criteria required articles that were peer-reviewed, by using i) English language March-September 2020; ii) Presented empirical studies related to COVID-19 (quantitative and qualitative); iii) Searched terms related to the general and community mental health, their policy, and COVID-19 pandemic. This study showed 19 articles related to community mental health issues or psychological wellbeing topics. The interventions provided to strengthen community mental health during the pandemic included emergency psychological crisis treatment, hotline assistance, online counseling service with mental care course, and outpatient consultation. Therefore, community mental health issues should be addressed with physical wellness. In addition, the community plays a key role in influencing stakeholders and governments, to increase the priority in supporting mental health.","Lestari, Retno; Setyawan, Febri Endra Budi",J Public Health Res,https://doi.org/10.4081/jphr.2021.2231; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33855426/,402

Within few weeks hospitals had to reorganize their internal logistics and structure covering any level of care, from the Emergency Room to medical Departments. METHODS: Due to the state of medical emergency, the Gynecology and Obstetrics Unit of the University Hospital in Udine developed new protocols for the usual standard of care, ensuring a safe environment for both healthcare providers and patients. RESULTS: By a continuous update of scientific evidence, the Department was able to increase capacity as well as maintain flexibility when an unexpected high number of admissions was required. 40 COVID -19 positive patients were admitted to our Department between March and December 2020, none of them had complications and no case of cross infection between patients and medical staff were registered.

These outbreaks originated at the border via isolating returnees, airline workers, and cargo vessels. Because a public health system was informed by real-time viral genomic sequencing and complete genomes typically were available within 12 hours of community-based positive COVID-19 test results, every outbreak was well-contained. A total of 225 community cases resulted in 3 deaths. Real-time genomics were essential for establishing links between cases when epidemiologic data could not do so and for identifying when concurrent outbreaks had different origins.","Douglas, Jordan; Geoghegan, Jemma L.; Hadfield, James; Bouckaert, Remco; Storey, Matthew; Ren, Xiaoyun; de Ligt, Joep; French, Nigel; Welch, David",Emerg Infect Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34424164/; https://doi.org/10.3201/eid2709.211097,402

MIS-C shares many clinical features with Kawasaki disease (KD), although clinical course and outcomes are divergent. We analyzed whole blood RNA sequences, serum cytokines, and formalin fixed heart tissues from these patients using a computational toolbox of two gene signatures, i.e., the 166-gene viral pandemic (ViP) signature, and its 20-gene severe (s)ViP subset that were developed in the context of SARS-CoV-2 infection and a 13-transcript signature previously demonstrated to be diagnostic for KD. Our analyses revealed that KD and MIS-C are on the same continuum of the host immune response as COVID-19. While both the pediatric syndromes converge upon an IL15/IL15RA-centric cytokine storm, suggestive of shared proximal pathways of immunopathogenesis, they diverge in other laboratory parameters and cardiac phenotypes. The ViP signatures also revealed unique targetable cytokine pathways in MIS-C, place MIS-C farther along in the spectrum in severity compared to KD and pinpoint key clinical (reduced cardiac function) and laboratory (thrombocytopenia and eosinopenia) parameters that can be useful to monitor severity.","Sahoo, Debashis; Katkar, Gajanan D.; Shimizu, Chisato; Kim, Jihoon; Khandelwal, Soni; Tremoulet, Adriana H.; Kanegaye, John; Bocchini, Joseph; Das, Soumita; Burns, Jane C.; Ghosh, Pradipta",bioRxiv,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33880476/; https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.04.11.439347,402

617242,Myocardial injury and risk factors for mortality in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia,2020-09-23,"Over the past 20 years there have been many important advances in knowledge about diarrhoeal diseases of children. Of these, the development of oral rehydration therapy (ORT), has been outstanding. This is based on the observation that intestinal sodium transport is enhanced by glucose transport in the small intestine and that this sodium‐coupled mechanism for glucose and water transport remains intact in the enterotoxigenic diarrhoeas despite the net secretory effects of bacterial enterotoxins on the small intestinal epithelium. The World Health Organisation has adopted ORT and strongly promoted its application for treatment of diarrhoeal diseases, particularly in developing countries. This has resulted in a drop in diarrhoeal disease mortality and the application of this treatment has been described in an Editorial in the Lancet us“potentially the most important medical advance this century” [1].","Gracey, Michael",Pediatr Int,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1785322/,402

In India, the first countrywide lockdown was imposed in phases starting from March 2020 to June 2020, followed by a continued restriction on in-person activities including study procedures, which halted the ESSENCE (Enabling translation of Science to Service to ENhance Depression CarE) trial activities such as recruitment, consenting, baseline assessment, digital training orientation, face to face training and end-line assessment evaluation. This situation made it imperative to amend procedures in order to mitigate the risk and address safety requirements for participants and the research team.

619929,Development and Validation of a Prognostic Risk Score System for COVID-19 Inpatients: A Multi-Center Retrospective Study in China,2020-11-28,"The main objective of the study was to design a pneumatic directional control valve for controlling pneumatic drives and produce it using a rapid prototyping technique. As the basic design assumption was to achieve high performance through a high flow rate and a low pressure drop, it was necessary to determine two flow parameters: the sonic conductance and the critical pressure ratio. The flow rate of compressed air and the diameters of the pneumatic conduits and fittings are important as they affect the rate of travel of the pneumatic cylinder piston. The 3D solid model of the directional control valve, developed in a CAD program, was used to simulate and optimize the flow rate. The analysis was performed by means of ANSYS CFX, a computational flow dynamics program. The main elements of the valve, i.e., the spool and the body, were produced using the PolyJet Matrix technology. The prototype was tested experimentally to determine the nominal flow-rate, calculate the flow parameters in accordance with the ISO 6358-1989 standard and compare them with the CFD simulation data. The simulation results showed very good agreement with the measurement data. The CFD analysis of the 3D solid model enabled us to optimize the flow of compressed air through the valve. The rapid prototyping method was found to be suitable to produce a fully functional directional control valve, which was confirmed through measurements at a test stand. The attempt to combine rapid prototyping used to fabricate pneumatic directional control valves with CFD used to simulate their operation was successful. The study shows that it is possible to design and construct a fully functional directional control valve characterized by high efficiency, high performance and a small pressure loss in a very short time and at a very low cost, which makes rapid prototyping superior to conventional methods of prototype making.","Blasiak, Slawomir; Laski, Pawel Andrzej; Takosoglu, Jakub Emanuel",Polymers (Basel),https://doi.org/10.3390/polym13091458; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33946344/,402

One specific aspect of global surgical care that has been severely limited is the ability for physicians and trainees to participate in global surgical outreach programs (GSOPs) in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). METHODS: A narrative review of the literature regarding GSOPs during the COVID-19 pandemic was performed. Factors that must be considered in the reinstatement of GSOPs were identified and suggestions to address them were provided based on the available literature and the experiences of the senior authors. RESULTS: As GSOPs were cancelled at the start of the pandemic, many academic surgeons turned to digital solutions in order to continue to engage with LMIC partners. With the advent of COVID-19 vaccines and improved access to testing and treatment worldwide, the recommencement of GSOPs may begin to be considered. Important considerations prior to initiation include vaccine and testing availability for visiting providers, local staff, and patients, local hospital capacity, staff and equipment shortages, and the characteristics of the patient population and visiting providers. Region- and country-specific factors, including local infection rates and concomitant health crises, must also be taken into account. Expansion of digital collaborative efforts may further deepen international connections and promote sustainable models of care. CONCLUSIONS: With careful consideration, GSOPs may begin to be safely restarted in the near future. The current paper evaluates individual factors that must be considered to safely restart GSOPs as the COVID-19 pandemic is better controlled.","Stoehr, Jenna Rose; Jahromi, Alireza Hamidian; Chu, Quyen D.; Zibari, Gazi B.; Gosain, Arun K.",Surgery,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34130811/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0039606021004487; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.surg.2021.05.029; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0039606021004487?v=s5,402

Las estrategias adoptadas para su prevención han incluido medidas de distanciamiento social, así como la modificación, reducción o interrupción de gran parte de la actividad sanitaria habitual. Esto ha afectado de forma muy notable a la asistencia prestada en las Unidades de Motilidad Digestiva. Superado el pico de mortalidad y contagios por la infección, se ha observado durante las últimas semanas en España y otros países europeos, una reducción paulatina en las cifras de transmisión. Sin embargo, el riesgo de reactivación sigue siendo alto, por lo que es necesario disponer de una planificación que permita a los centros sanitarios reiniciar con seguridad para pacientes y profesionales, las exploraciones instrumentales vinculadas al manejo de la patología motora. La Asociación Española de Neurogastroenterología y Motilidad (ASENEM) ha elaborado una serie de recomendaciones prácticas basadas en la evidencia científica disponible y en el consenso de un panel de expertos, y adaptadas a los riesgos inherentes a cada actividad. Se incluyen propuestas de protección individual, pero también medidas organizativas y estructurales, cuyo objetivo es permitir reanudar progresivamente las exploraciones, minimizando la posibilidad de contagio. Abstract The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was responsible for the outbreak of the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19), which is now considered as a pandemic. The prevention strategies adopted have included social distancing measures and the modification, reduction or interruption of a large proportion of routine healthcare activity. This has had a significant impact on the care provided in Gastrointestinal Motility Units. Having passed the peak, in terms of mortality and infections, a gradual reduction in transmission figures has been observed in Spain and other European countries. The risk of reactivation, however, remains high, so it is necessary to have a plan in place that allows healthcare centres to safely resume, for their patients and professionals, instrumental examinations linked to the management of motor pathology. Based on the available scientific evidence and the consensus of a panel of experts, the Spanish Association of Neurogastroenterology and Motility (ASENEM) has drawn up a series of practical recommendations, which have been adapted to the risks inherent in each activity. These include individual protection proposals, as well as organisational and structural measures, which are conceived to allow for the gradual resumption of examinations while minimising the possibility of contagion.","Alcedo, J; Serra, J; de la Serna, J Pérez; Mas, P; Barba, E; Suárez, JF; Accarino, A",Gastroenterol Hepatol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32680731/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.gastrohep.2020.05.011; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0210570520302193; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0210570520302193?v=s5,402

The confined conditions in prisons can encourage person-to-person spread with the potential for outbreaks occurring. Contact tracing is an important contributor to the longer-term management strategy for COVID-19 in prisons as well as in the community but is highly resource-intensive. This paper describes the approach to contact tracing taken by the Irish Prison Service (IPS). METHODS: The IPS National Infection Control Team, in collaboration with the National Quality Improvement (QI) team and Health Service Executive (HSE) in Ireland, implemented a programme to develop and train in-prison contact tracing teams (CTTs). CTTs were run by prison staff with experience of working with detainees, prison IT systems and CCTV. Protocols for undertaking contact tracing for both detainee and staff cases of COVID-19 were established. RESULTS: All prisons, and two support agencies, within the IPS now have fully functional in-prison CTTs. Every CTT has responded to at least one case COVID-19, undertaken contact tracing and instigated quarantine of contacts. CONCLUSIONS: A partnership approach with development of prison-led CTTs can provide an effective mechanism for contact tracing of COVID-19 cases within the prison setting.","Clarke, Mattea; Devlin, John; Conroy, Emmett; Kelly, Enda; Sturup-Toft, Sunita",J Public Health (Oxf),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32567653/; https://doi.org/10.1093/pubmed/fdaa092,402

However, structural and ultrastructural evidence on how the SARS-CoV-2 infection progresses in the native cellular context is scarce, and there is a lack of comprehensive knowledge on the SARS-CoV-2 replicative cycle. To correlate cytopathic events induced by SARS-CoV-2 with virus replication processes in frozen-hydrated cells, we established a unique multi-modal, multi-scale cryo-correlative platform to image SARS-CoV-2 infection in Vero cells. This platform combines serial cryoFIB/SEM volume imaging and soft X-ray cryo-tomography with cell lamellae-based cryo-electron tomography (cryoET) and subtomogram averaging. Here we report critical SARS-CoV-2 structural events – e.g. viral RNA transport portals, virus assembly intermediates, virus egress pathway, and native virus spike structures, in the context of whole-cell volumes revealing drastic cytppathic changes.

We need to understand why we were all caught unprepared. On the one hand, we have all short memories. As we forget too quickly, we were unable to recognize key factors influencing response and preparedness to public health threats. For many years, economic evaluation pushed governments all over the world to cut resources for public health systems, with COVID-19 pandemic the question arises: do we spend too much or too little on health care? What is the right amount to spend on health? Moreover, in many countries, the privatisation, or semi-privatisation, of healthcare may give rise to inequitable access to health care for everyone. Although COVID-19 is very “democratic”, its consequences aren’t. According to OECD, income inequality in OECD countries is at its highest level for the past half century. Three main causes have been recognized, technological revolution, globalization, and “financialisation”. In this scenario, lockdown measures adopted to save lives are showing dramatic economic consequences. To address post COVID-19 reconstruction we need to go beyond GDP. As an economic measure this has many shortcomings in describing the real well-being of a country, and since what we measure affects what we do, new paradigms will have to guide the post COVID-19 reconstruction strategies, as the fate of countries and their citizens is at stake.","Illario, M; Zavagli, V; Ferreira, L Noronha; Sambati, M; Teixeira, A; Lanata, F; Pais, S; Farrell, J; Tramontano, D",Transl Med UniSa,https://doi.org/10.37825/2239-9747.1000; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34447701/,402

CRCoV may play an important role in canine infectious respiratory disease (CIRD) either by predisposing to further and potentially more serious viral and bacterial infections or possibly as a primary pathogen. The prevalence of serum antibodies to CRCoV, in a population of dogs in the south east of England, has been shown previously to be 30.1% on the first day of entry to a rehoming kennel [Erles, K., Toomey, C., Brooks, H.W., Brownlie, J., 2003. Detection of a group 2 coronavirus in dogs with canine infectious respiratory disease. Virology 310, 216–223]. The purpose of this study was to establish the prevalence of CRCoV in the general canine population within as well as outside the UK. An ELISA, used to test for the presence of antibodies to CRCoV in canine serum samples, identified seropositive dogs in UK, USA, Canada, Republic of Ireland and Greece. The development of an ELISA based on CRCoV antigen and immunofluorescence assay are described here. 54.7% (547/1000) of North American and 36.0% (297/824) of United Kingdom dogs were seropositive for CRCoV. The age and geographical distribution of seropositive dogs was also assessed. The cross-reactivity demonstrated between CRCoV antibodies from different countries and a UK viral isolate suggests immunological similarity. The overall prevalence of this virus in both North America and the UK suggests that CRCoV has international significance and that further epidemiological studies are required.","Priestnall, Simon L.; Brownlie, Joe; Dubovi, Edward J.; Erles, Kerstin",Vet Microbiol,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S037811350600071X; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16551493/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S037811350600071X,402

It is important to develop human-like animal models for investigating the mechanisms that SARS-CoV-2 uses to infect humans and cause COVID-19. Several studies demonstrated that the non-human primate (NHP) is permissive for SARS-CoV-2 infection to cause typical clinical symptoms including fever, cough, breathing difficulty, and other diagnostic abnormalities such as immunopathogenesis and hyperplastic lesions in the lung. These NHP models have been used for investigating the potential infection route and host immune response to SARS-CoV-2, as well as testing vaccines and drugs. This review aims to summarize the benefits and caveats of NHP models currently available for SARS-CoV-2, and to discuss key topics including model optimization, extended application, and clinical translation.","Yuan, Lunzhi; Tang, Qiyi; Zhu, Huachen; Guan, Yi; Cheng, Tong; Xia, Ningshao",Emerg Microbes Infect,https://doi.org/10.1080/22221751.2021.1976598; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34490832/,402

Case Summary: A 72-year-old woman with multiple comorbidities underwent surgical replacement of the aortic valve with a mechanical prosthetic valve after recurrent IE. After 10 years, IE recurred and the mechanical valve was surgically replaced with a bioprosthetic valve. Ten years later, severe heart failure developed due to severe paravalvular leak (PVL) caused by an aortic annulus abscess complicated by a paravalvular pseudoaneurysm fistula (PPF). The patient was deemed at prohibitive surgical risk and a catheter-based PVL closure procedure was planned. However, the interventional procedure was delayed several months due to the Covid-19 pandemic with progressive heart failure worsening. Despite an acute satisfactory result of the PPF transcatheter closure and a significant clinical improvement, the patient died 10 months later due to multiorgan failure. It is likely that this was due, at least in part, to the long treatment delay caused by the unprecedented strain on the healthcare system. Discussion: In patients at high surgical risk, early diagnosis and prompt interventional treatment of severe PVL are crucial for improving expectancy and quality of life. However, the recent outbreak of COVID-19 caused deferral of elective and semi-elective structural heart disease procedures (SHD) as in our case. Thus, a proactive and vigilant stance on managing SHD should be a priority even in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Onorato, Eustaquio Maria; Vercellino, Matteo; Masoero, Giovanni; Monizzi, Giovanni; Sanchez, Federico; Muratori, Manuela; Bartorelli, Antonio L.",Front Cardiovasc Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34497834/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fcvm.2021.693732,402

Currently, the vaccines have great hope, but it takes years for testing its efficacy in human. As there is no specific drug treatment available for COVID-19 pandemic, we explored in silico repurposing of drugs with dual inhibition properties by targeting transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2) and human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) from FDA-approved drugs. The TMPRSS2 and ACE2 dual inhibitors in COVID-19 would be a novel antiviral class of drugs called “entry inhibitors.” For this purpose, approximately 2800 US-FDA approved drugs were docked using a virtual docking tool with the targets TMPRSS2 and ACE2. The best-fit drugs were selected as per docking scores and visual outcomes. Later on, drugs were selected on the basis of molecular dynamics simulations. The drugs alvimopan, arbekacin, dequalinum, fleroxacin, lopinavir, and valrubicin were shortlisted by visual analysis and molecular dynamics simulations. Among these, lopinavir and valrubicin were found to be superior in terms of dual inhibition. Thus, lopinavir and valrubicin have the potential of dual-target inhibition whereby preventing SARS-CoV-2 entry to the host. For repurposing of these drugs, further screening in vitro and in vivo would help in exploring clinically.","Baby, Krishnaprasad; Maity, Swastika; Mehta, Chetan H.; Suresh, Akhil; Nayak, Usha Y.; Nayak, Yogendra",Eur J Pharmacol,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0014299921000753; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33539819/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0014299921000753; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejphar.2021.173922,402

However, most long-term care facilities require a negative COVID-19 test result before accepting patients discharged from the hospital which directly contravenes the CDC guidelines. Due to delays in COVID-19 testing and obtaining test results, patients end up staying additional 2–3 days in the hospital before they can be discharged to nursing care facilities. Furthermore, hospitals have reported facing resistance from health insurance plans to paying for patients’ additional days in the hospital while awaiting COVID-19 test results. Hospitals across the country continue to experience an increase in hospitalizations for COVID-19 infection.

624598,COVID 19 and heart failure: from infection to inflammation and angiotensin II stimulation. Searching for evidence from a new disease,2020-05-15,"BACKGROUND: Individuals with complex dyslipidemia, or those with medication intolerance, are often difficult to manage in primary care. They require the additional attention, expertise, and adherence counseling that occurs in multidisciplinary lipid clinics (MDLCs). We conducted a program evaluation of the first year of a newly implemented MDLC utilizing the RE-AIM (reach, effectiveness, adoption, implementation, and maintenance) framework to provide empirical data not only on program effectiveness, but also on components important to local sustainability and future generalizability. METHODS: The purpose of the MDLC is to increase the uptake of guideline-based care for lipid conditions. Established in 2019, the MDLC provides care via a centralized clinic location within the healthcare system. Primary care providers and cardiologists were invited to refer individuals with lipid conditions. Using a pre/post-study design, we evaluated the implementation outcomes from the MDLC using the RE-AIM framework. RESULTS: In 2019, 420 referrals were made to the MDLC (reach). Referrals were made by 19% (148) of the 796 active cardiology and primary care providers, with an average of 35 patient referrals per month in 2019 (SD 12) (adoption). The MDLC saw 83 patients in 2019 (reach). Additionally, 50% (41/82) had at least one follow-up MDLC visit, and 12% (10/82) had two or more follow-up visits in 2019 (implementation). In patients seen by the MDLC, we found an improved diagnosis of specific lipid conditions (FH (familial hypercholesterolemia), hypertriglyceridemia, and dyslipidemia), increased prescribing of evidence-based therapies, high rates of medication prior authorization approvals, and significant reductions in lipid levels by lipid condition subgroup (effectiveness). Over time, the operations team decided to transition from in-person follow-up to telehealth appointments to increase capacity and sustain the clinic (maintenance). CONCLUSIONS: Despite limited reach and adoption of the MDLC, we found a large intervention effect that included improved diagnosis, increased prescribing of guideline-recommended treatments, and clinically significant reduction of lipid levels. Attention to factors including solutions to decrease the large burden of unseen referrals, discussion of the appropriate number and duration of visits, and sustainability of the clinic model could aid in enhancing the success of the MDLC and improving outcomes for more patients throughout the system.","Jones, Laney K.; McMinn, Megan; Kann, David; Lesko, Michael; Sturm, Amy C.; Walters, Nicole; Chen, Nan; Fry, Kerrianne; Brownson, Ross C.; Gidding, Samuel S.; Williams, Marc S.; Rahm, Alanna Kulchak",Implement Sci Commun,https://doi.org/10.1186/s43058-021-00135-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33741054/,402

The presence of effector T cells in patients with mild disease and dysfunctional T cells in severely ill patients suggests that adequate T‐cell responses limit disease severity. Understanding how cDCs cope with SARS‐CoV‐2 can help elucidate how protective immune responses are generated. Here, we report that cDC2 subtypes exhibit similar infection‐induced gene signatures, with the upregulation of interferon‐stimulated genes and interleukin (IL)‐6 signaling pathways. Furthermore, comparison of cDCs between patients with severe and mild disease showed severely ill patients to exhibit profound downregulation of genes encoding molecules involved in antigen presentation, such as MHCII, TAP, and costimulatory proteins, whereas we observed the opposite for proinflammatory molecules, such as complement and coagulation factors. Thus, as disease severity increases, cDC2s exhibit enhanced inflammatory properties and lose antigen presentation capacity. Moreover, DC3s showed upregulation of anti‐apoptotic genes and accumulated during infection. Direct exposure of cDC2s to the virus in vitro recapitulated the activation profile observed in vivo. Our findings suggest that SARS‐CoV‐2 interacts directly with cDC2s and implements an efficient immune escape mechanism that correlates with disease severity by downregulating crucial molecules required for T‐cell activation.

To this end, researchers have relied on repeated cross-sectional (RCS) studies, in which different people from the same population participate on different measurement occasions. Also, researchers have relied on panel studies, in which the same group of people participate on different measurement occasions. However, few studies have directly tested whether participants' responses in RCS studies were similar to those found in panel studies. To address this gap, we compared the responses to 33 items, 28 of which were further grouped into four aggregates (Affections, Worries, States, Health concerns), over 8 weeks during the first COVID-19 lockdown in Denmark in a RCS study (overall N = 5,993, per measurement occasion 616 ≤ n ≤ 964) with the responses in a largely equivalent panel study (993 ≤ n ≤ 2,546 across measurement occasions). The study participants were randomly drawn from the same quota-representative participant pool and responded to the same items on the same measurement occasions. Results indicated a few differences between the study samples on the first measurement occasion (i.e., selection effects between studies). Further, we found statistical support for different trajectories in 21 aggregates/items. However, visual inspection of the trajectories suggested subtle differences between the studies at large. The results thus raise awareness that the trajectories of people's thoughts, feelings, and behaviors can differ between survey methods, especially when only a few measurement occasions are considered. Nevertheless, such differences might not be substantial over time.

A sample of 159 Italian workers took part in the study and completed the self-report measures. Results showed a positive association between extraversion, agreeableness and conscientiousness and job crafting (total), individual job crafting, and collaborative job crafting, with significant mediations of insight orientation. Openness was positively associated with job crafting (total) and individual job crafting, but not with the collaborative subdimension, with insight orientation that mediated existing relationships. Emotional stability and job crafting (total) or its subdimensions were found to have no significant relationships.

METHODS: We developed a dynamic COVID-19 microsimulation model to evaluate clinical and economic outcomes and cost-effectiveness of epidemic control strategies in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. Interventions assessed were Healthcare Testing (HT), where diagnostic testing is performed only for those presenting to healthcare centres; Contact Tracing (CT) in households of cases; Isolation Centres (IC), for cases not requiring hospitalisation; community health worker-led Mass Symptom Screening and diagnostic testing for symptomatic individuals (MS); and Quarantine Centres (QC), for contacts who test negative. Given uncertainties about epidemic dynamics in South Africa, we evaluated two main epidemic scenarios over 360 days, with effective reproduction numbers (R(e)) of 1·5 and 1·2. We compared HT, HT+CT, HT+CT+IC, HT+CT+IC+MS, HT+CT+IC+QC, and HT+CT+IC+MS+QC, considering strategies with incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) <US$1,290/year-of-life saved (YLS) to be cost-effective. FINDINGS: With R(e) 1·5, HT resulted in the most COVID-19 deaths and lowest costs over 360 days. Compared with HT, HT+CT+IC+MS reduced mortality by 76%, increased costs by 16%, and was cost-effective (ICER $350/YLS). HT+CT+IC+MS+QC provided the greatest reduction in mortality, but increased costs by 95% compared with HT+CT+IC+MS and was not cost-effective (ICER $8,000/YLS). With R(e) 1·2, HT+CT+IC+MS was the least costly strategy, and HT+CT+IC+MS+QC was not cost-effective (ICER $294,320/YLS). INTERPRETATION: In South Africa, a strategy of household contact tracing, isolation, and mass symptom screening would substantially reduce COVID-19 mortality and be cost-effective. Adding quarantine centres for COVID-19 contacts is not cost-effective.","Reddy, Krishna P.; Shebl, Fatma M.; Foote, Julia H.

Objective of this study was to investigate the immediate and long-term health effects of living in an environment with gas-mining induced earthquakes and related stressors in the Netherlands. METHODS: Data on psychological, somatic and social problems recorded routinely in electronic health records by general practitioners during a 6-year period (2010–2015) were combined with socioeconomic status and seismicity data. To assess immediate health effects of exposure to M(L)≥1.5 earthquakes, relative risk ratios were calculated for patients in the week of an earthquake and the week afterwards, and compared to the week before the earthquake. To analyse long-term health effects, relative risks of different groups, adjusted for age, sex and socioeconomic status, were computed per year and compared. RESULTS: Apart from an increase in suicidality, few immediate health changes were found in an earthquake week or week afterwards. Generally, the prevalence of health problems was higher in the mining province in the first years, but dropped to levels equal to or even below the control group in subsequent years, with lower relative risks observed in more frequently exposed patients. CONCLUSIONS: From a public health perspective, the findings are fascinating. Contrary to our expectation, health problems presented in general practice in the earthquake province decreased during the study period. More frequently exposed populations reported fewer health issues to general practitioners, which might point at health adaptation to chronic exposure to stressors.","Dückers, Michel L A; Baliatsas, Christos; Spreeuwenberg, Peter; Verheij, Robert A; Reifels, Lennart; Yzermans, C Joris",Eur J Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33496336/; https://doi.org/10.1093/eurpub/ckaa244,402

However, in many countries, ID is not recognized as a qualifying specialty. The creation of ID residency in 2017 in France offers the opportunity to know how and why the specialty is chosen by medical students. METHODS: We first analyzed the choice of specialty of all French medical students in 2017 and 2018 according to their rank at the national exam that ends medical studies. A web questionnaire was then sent in January 2019 to all ID residents in France (n = 100) to assess the factors influencing their choice of specialty and their career plan. RESULTS: We analyzed the choice of 17,087 medical students. ID was the first-chosen specialty with a median national rank of 526/8539, followed by plastic surgery and ophthalmology. The questionnaire was completed by 90% of the French ID residents (n = 100). The most encouraging factors to choose ID were the multi-system approach of the specialty, the importance of diagnostic medicine and having done an internship in ID during medical school. The potential deterrents were the work-life balance, the workload and the salary. CONCLUSIONS: The recent recognition of ID as a qualifying specialty in France can be considered a success insofar as the specialty is the most popular among all medical and surgical specialties. Individuals who choose ID are attracted by the intellectual stimulation of the specialty but express concerns about the working conditions and salaries.

A multidisciplinary diabetic disease is a life-threatening disease all over the world. It attacks different vital parts of the human body, like Neuropathy, Retinopathy, Nephropathy, and ultimately Heart. A smart healthcare recommendation system predicts and recommends the diabetic disease accurately using optimal machine learning models with the data fusion technique on healthcare datasets. Various machine learning models and methods have been proposed in the recent past to predict diabetes disease. Still, these systems cannot handle the massive number of multifeatures datasets on diabetes disease properly. A smart healthcare recommendation system is proposed for diabetes disease based on deep machine learning and data fusion perspectives. Using data fusion, we can eliminate the irrelevant burden of system computational capabilities and increase the proposed system's performance to predict and recommend this life-threatening disease more accurately. Finally, the ensemble machine learning model is trained for diabetes prediction. This intelligent recommendation system is evaluated based on a well-known diabetes dataset, and its performance is compared with the most recent developments from the literature. The proposed system achieved 99.6% accuracy, which is higher compared to the existing deep machine learning methods.

As a public health and a multidimensional social problem, obesity must be dealt with in a holistic, open, and cross-disciplinary manner to ensure that it can be understood coherently. The only way to keep the usefulness of the Mediterranean diet within desirable limits will be our societies’ vitality and interest in rapidly adapting the Mediterranean diet to social change, thus providing valid answers to today’s needs.","Medina, Francesc Xavier; Solé-Sedeno, Josep M.; Bach-Faig, Anna; Aguilar-Martínez, Alicia",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18073715; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33918238/,402

This study aims to identify factors that may explain the variation in CFR across countries. Methods: We identified 24 potential risk factors affecting CFR. For all countries with over 5000 reported COVID-19 cases, we used country-specific datasets from the WHO, the OECD, and the United Nations to quantify each of these factors. We examined univariable relationships of each variable with CFR, as well as correlations among predictors and potential interaction terms. Our final multivariable negative binomial model included univariable predictors of significance and all significant interaction terms. Results: Across the 39 countries under consideration, our model shows COVID-19 case fatality rate was best predicted by time to implementation of social distancing measures, hospital beds per 1000 individuals, percent population over 70 years, CT scanners per 1 million individuals, and (in countries with high population density) smoking prevalence. Conclusion: Our model predicted an increased CFR for countries that waited over 14 days to implement social distancing interventions after the 100th reported case. Smoking prevalence and percentage population over the age of 70 years were also associated with higher CFR. Hospital beds per 1000 and CT scanners per million were identified as possible protective factors associated with decreased CFR.","Pan, Jennifer; St. Pierre, Joseph Marie; Pickering, Trevor A.; Demirjian, Natalie L.; Fields, Brandon K.K.; Desai, Bhushan; Gholamrezanezhad, Ali",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33167564/; https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph17218189,402
632320,Microbial co-infections and super-infections in critical COVID-19: A Kenyan retrospective cohort analysis,2021-10-04,"Introduction Asthma is a clinical syndrome characterized by reversible and recurrent airway obstruction leading to the symptoms of wheezing, cough, shortness of breath, fatigue, and respiratory distress. It is one of the most common lung pathologies worldwide. Its incidence is on the rise in Pakistan, which may be due to overt environmental pollution or improving screening protocols. Irrespective more and more patients are now being diagnosed as cases of asthma and this has led to renewed interest in research for the subject locally. Vitamin D plays a key component of the immune system and its deficiency has been associated with diseases, such as inflammatory bowel disease, celiac disease, rheumatoid arthritis, depression, sepsis, and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia. The role of vitamin D in exacerbation, prevention, causation, and treatment of asthma is still up for debate. However, as more data emerges, it is becoming evident that vitamin D in one way or another is linked to outcomes in asthma. Especially the deficiency of vitamin D in asthma and its supplementation has garnered great attention in scientific trials. Our research is just one small step in this direction. This study aims to evaluate the frequency of vitamin D deficiency in patients with asthma. Methods This was a retrospective cross-sectional cohort conducted at the Department of Medicine of Abbasi Shaheed Hospital Karachi (ASHK) during March 2019 to August 2019. Patients of either gender aged ≥18 years that were diagnosed with cases of asthma were eligible to be included in the study. Asthma was defined in accordance with the latest guidelines issued by the Pakistan Chest Society. A vitamin D level of <20 ng/dl was considered deficient. Patient confidentiality was made certain. Results A total of 97 (62.98%) of the 154 patients included in the study had <20 ng/ml of vitamin D level. The mean vitamin D level recorded in this study was 15.34±4.21 ng/dl. The male-to-female ratio was 1:5. The mean age of our cohort was 42.78±4.56 years. The mean duration of disease, i.e., asthma was 6.7±3.68 years. Both the age of the patients and duration of the disease were found to be statistically significant with respect to vitamin D levels in asthmatics. Conclusions The frequency of vitamin D deficiency is very high in patients with asthma. These suboptimal levels are significantly influenced by the age of the patient and the duration of the disease.","Alvi, Souhaib; Syed, Jabbar Ghufran; Nusrat, Baakh; Abbas Razvi, Syed Kumail; Shah, Zunaira Z; Shafaat khan, Yusra; Danish Khan, Muhammad; Ali Khan, Muhammad",Cureus,https://doi.org/10.7759/cureus.14828; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34104581/,402

Using models applied to hospital and death data, we estimate the impact of the lockdown and current population immunity. We find 3.6% of infected individuals are hospitalized and 0.7% die, ranging from 0.001% in those <20 years of age (ya) to 10.1% in those >80ya. Across all ages, men are more likely to be hospitalized, enter intensive care, and die than women. The lockdown reduced the reproductive number from 2.90 to 0.67 (77% reduction). By 11 May 2020, when interventions are scheduled to be eased, we project 2.8 million (range: 1.8–4.7) people, or 4.4% (range: 2.8–7.2) of the population, will have been infected. Population immunity appears insufficient to avoid a second wave if all control measures are released at the end of the lockdown.","Salje, Henrik; Tran Kiem, Cécile; Lefrancq, Noémie; Courtejoie, Noémie; Bosetti, Paolo; Paireau, Juliette; Andronico, Alessio; Hozé, Nathanaël; Richet, Jehanne; Dubost, Claire-Lise; Le Strat, Yann; Lessler, Justin; Levy-Bruhl, Daniel; Fontanet, Arnaud; Opatowski, Lulla; Boelle, Pierre-Yves; Cauchemez, Simon",Science,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32404476/; https://doi.org/10.1126/science.abc3517,402
633745,Trimming the need for invasive ventilation: pragmatic critical care during the COVID-19 pandemic,2020-09-08,"Diverse SARS-like coronaviruses (SL-CoVs) have been identified from bats and other animal species. Like SARS-CoV, some bat SL-CoVs, such as WIV1, also use angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) from human and bat as entry receptor. However, whether these viruses can also use the ACE2 of other animal species as their receptor remains to be determined. We report herein that WIV1 has a broader tropism to ACE2 orthologs than SARS-CoV isolate Tor2. Among the 9 ACE2 orthologs examined, human ACE2 exhibited the highest efficiency to mediate the infection of WIV1 pseudotyped virus. Our findings thus imply that WIV1 has the potential to infect a wide range of wild animals and may directly jump to humans. We also showed that cell entry of WIV1 could be restricted by interferon-induced transmembrane proteins (IFITMs). However, WIV1 could exploit the airway protease TMPRSS2 to partially evade the IFITM3 restriction. Interestingly, we also found that amphotericin B could enhance the infectious entry of SARS-CoVs and SL-CoVs by evading IFITM3-mediated restriction. Collectively, our findings further underscore the risk of exposure to animal SL-CoVs and highlight the vulnerability of patients who take amphotericin B to infection by SL-CoVs, including the most recently emerging (SARS-CoV-2).","Zheng, Mei; Zhao, Xuesen; Zheng, Shuangli; Chen, Danying; Du, Pengcheng; Li, Xinglin; Jiang, Dong; Guo, Ju-Tao; Zeng, Hui; Lin, Hanxin",Emerging microbes & infections,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32602823/; https://doi.org/10.1080/22221751.2020.1787797,402

Recent studies have identified preliminary evidence of widening disparities in suicidal behaviors across sex, sexual orientation, race/ethnicity, age, and socioeconomic status among college students. Few systematic reviews and meta-analyses offer a comprehensive understanding of on-campus and off-campus suicide interventions, nor is collated information available for different types of screening, assessment, treatment, and postvention plans. Further challenges have been identified since the COVID-19 pandemic, calling for cost-effective and innovative interventions to address increased rates of suicidal behaviors among college students facing unprecedented stressors. OBJECTIVE: This research protocol describes the first systematic review and meta-analysis to identify the most effective and cost-effective intervention components for universal and targeted (indicated and selected) suicide prevention among college students in a global context. Special attention will be placed on disparities in suicide prevention across sociodemographic subgroups, inclusive interventions beyond campus, global context, and intervention responses to the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: A sensitive search strategy will be executed across MEDLINE (Ovid), EMBASE, PsycINFO (EBSCO), ERIC (EBSCO), Cochrane Library, Dissertations and Theses Global (ProQuest), Scopus, Global Index Medicus, SciELO, African Journals Online, Global Health (CABI), and Google Scholar. Data extraction and evaluation will be conducted by three independent researchers. Risk of bias will be assessed. A multilevel meta-regression model and subgroup analysis will be used to analyze the data and estimate effect sizes. RESULTS: The initial search was completed in December 2020 and updated with additional other-language studies in March 2020. We expect the results to be submitted for publication in mid-2021. CONCLUSIONS: Despite increasing rates of suicidal behaviors among college students, few preventative efforts have targeted this population, and fewer focus on factors that might place specific demographic groups at heightened risk. The impact of COVID-19 on suicidal behaviors among college students highlights and exacerbates the urgent need for rapid and effective interventions that might differ from traditional approaches. This equity-focused study will address these gaps and provide a valuable analysis of the effectiveness of suicide prevention programs and interventions. Findings will inform clinicians, researchers, policy makers, families, and organizations about evidence-based interventions for reducing the gaps in the suicide crisis among college students from different sociodemographic groups.

In 464 samples collected before the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 (2017 and 2018), our virus neutralization assay had a 100% specificity. It was used to test 998 samples collected from blood donors during the last week of March or the first week of April 2020. As expected at this stage of the outbreak, the prevalence was low (2.7%) and, importantly, criteria for blood donation imply that the vast majority of seropositives had asymptomatic or pauci-symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections. Seroprevalence values did not differ significantly among age groups (but were slightly higher in donors <30yo and ≥60yo), and between males and females (2.82% vs 2.69%), unlike what has been observed regarding hospitalizations admission to ICU and death rates in France. By contrast, we observed that the proportion of seropositives was significantly lower in group O donors (1.32% vs 3.86% in other donors, p = 0.014). We conclude that virus infection seems to occur with a similar incidence in men and women among French blood donors, but that blood group O persons are less at risk of being infected and not only of suffering from severe clinical presentations, as previously suggested.","Gallian, Pierre; Pastorino, Boris; Morel, Pascal; Chiaroni, Jacques; Ninove, Laetitia; de Lamballerie, Xavier",Antiviral Res,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166354220302941?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32679056/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.antiviral.2020.104880; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0166354220302941,402

In connected speech there was significant attenuation of mean spectral level at 1–8 kHz region and there was no significant change in this measure at 0–1 kHz. Mean spectral levels of vowel did not change significantly in mask-wearing conditions. LH1000 for connected speech significantly increased whilst wearing either a surgical mask or KN95 mask but no significant change in this measure was found for vowel. HNR was higher in the mask-wearing conditions than the no-mask condition. CPPS and vocal intensity did not change in mask-wearing conditions.

Methods: A PubMed search was conducted on 3 January 2021, and as a result, 952 articles were retrieved. Exclusion of irrelevant articles resulted in 36 articles, dating from 1998 to 2020, which were analysed. Results: Only 52.8% of these articles described original research, while the rest were reviews. The majority (26) of the articles dealt with bacterial infections, of which 20 described Chlamydia trachomatis. There were 11 articles that described research on viruses, with five on severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The analysis of the articles showed further that not much new knowledge on the long-term effects on male reproductive functions has been added. The existing knowledge that ascending infections can cause epididymo-orchitis, prostatitis or urethritis was confirmed. Due to epithelial inflammatory responses these infections can result in scarring with resulting infertility due to obstruction. These effects were described for Chlamydia trachomatis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Mycoplasma genitalium or Treponema pallidum, as well as for the Zika and SARS-CoV-2 viruses. Even trichomoniasis can lead to long-term compromised male fertility if not treated.

635786,Acute kidney failure in patients admitted due to COVID-19,2021-02-23,"BACKGROUND: Individuals with a history of traumatic brain injury (TBI) report fewer social contacts, less social participation, and more social isolation than noninjured peers. Cognitive-communication disabilities may prevent individuals with TBI from accessing the opportunities for social connection afforded by computer-mediated communication, as individuals with TBI report lower overall usage of social media than noninjured peers and substantial challenges with accessibility and usability. Although adaptations for individuals with motor and sensory impairments exist to support social media use, there have been no parallel advances to support individuals with cognitive disabilities, such as those exhibited by some people with TBI. In this study, we take a preliminary step in the development process by learning more about patterns of social media use in individuals with TBI as well as their input and priorities for developing social media adaptations. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to characterize how and why adults with TBI use social media and computer-mediated communication platforms, to evaluate changes in computer-mediated communication after brain injury, and to elicit suggestions from individuals with TBI to improve access to social media after injury. METHODS: We conducted a web-based survey of 53 individuals with a chronic history of moderate-to-severe TBI and a demographically matched group of 51 noninjured comparison peers. RESULTS: More than 90% of participants in both groups had an account on at least one computer-mediated communication platform, with Facebook and Facebook Messenger being the most popular platforms in both groups. Participants with and without a history of TBI reported that they use Facebook more passively than actively and reported that they most frequently maintain web-based relationships with close friends and family members. However, participants with TBI reported less frequently than noninjured comparison participants that they use synchronous videoconferencing platforms, are connected with acquaintances on the web, or use social media as a gateway for offline social connection (eg, to find events). Of the participants with TBI, 23% (12/53) reported a change in their patterns of social media use caused by brain injury and listed concerns about accessibility, safety, and usability as major barriers. CONCLUSIONS: Although individuals with TBI maintain social media accounts to the same extent as healthy comparisons, some may not use them in a way that promotes social connection. Thus, it is important to design social media adaptations that address the needs and priorities of individuals with TBI, so they can also reap the benefits of social connectedness offered by these platforms. By considering computer-mediated communication as part of individuals’ broader social health, we may be able to increase web-based participation in a way that is meaningful, positive, and beneficial to broader social life.","Morrow, Emily L; Zhao, Fangyun; Turkstra, Lyn; Toma, Catalina; Mutlu, Bilge; Duff, Melissa C",JMIR Rehabil Assist Technol,https://doi.org/10.2196/26586; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34448727/,402

Methods: A retrospective descriptive case-series study conducted at a large University-hospital in northern Italy, an area severely hit by the epidemic. Results: Between 23 February and 14 May 2020, 4160 (52%) COVID-19 and 3778 (48%) non-COVID-19 patients were hospitalized. COVID-19 admissions peaked in the second half of March, a period characterized by an extremely high mortality rate (27.4%). The number of admissions in 2020 was similar to 2019, but COVID-19 patients gradually occupied all available beds. Comparison between COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 admissions in 2020 revealed significant differences concerning all age classes and gender. Specifically, COVID-19 patients were older, predominantly male, and exhibited more comorbidities. Overall, admissions for non-communicable diseases (NCDs) in 2020 vs. 2019 dropped by approximately one third. Statistically significant reductions were observed for acute myocardial infarction (−78, −33.9%), cerebrovascular disease (−235, −41.5%), and cancer (−368, −31.9%). While the first two appeared equally distributed between COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 patients, chronic NCDs were statistically significantly more frequent in the former, except cancer, which was less frequent in COVID-19 patients.

Here, we developed a novel structural network controllability-based personalized driver genes and combinatorial drug identification algorithm (CPGD), aiming to identify combinatorial drugs for an individual patient by targeting personalized driver genes from network controllability perspective. On two benchmark disease datasets (i.e. breast cancer and lung cancer datasets), performance of CPGD is superior to that of other state-of-the-art driver gene-focus methods in terms of discovery rate among prior-known clinical efficacious combinatorial drugs. Especially on breast cancer dataset, CPGD evaluated synergistic effect of pairwise drug combinations by measuring synergistic effect of their corresponding personalized driver gene modules, which are affected by a given targeting personalized driver gene set of drugs. The results showed that CPGD performs better than existing synergistic combinatorial strategies in identifying clinical efficacious paired combinatorial drugs. Furthermore, CPGD enhanced cancer subtyping by computationally providing personalized side effect signatures for individual patients.

Data on sociodemographic factors, forgoing health care, and anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were collected. Of the patients, 38.5% reported forgoing health care. Forgoing health care was more frequent for younger patients, women, patients with a low level of education, and patients with a chronic disease (p < .001).

637760,Antibiotics in acute bronchitis: a meta-analysis,1999-07-07,"BACKGROUND: Brazil became the epicenter of the COVID-19 epidemic in a brief period of a few months after the first officially registered case. The knowledge of the epidemiological/clinical profile and the risk factors of Brazilian COVID-19 patients can assist in the decision making of physicians in the implementation of early and most appropriate measures for poor prognosis patients. However, these reports are missing. Here we present a comprehensive study that addresses this demand. METHODS: This data-driven study was based on the Brazilian Ministry of Health Database (SIVEP-Gripe) regarding notified cases of hospitalized COVID-19 patients during the period from February 26th to August 10th, 2020. Demographic data, clinical symptoms, comorbidities and other additional information of patients were analyzed. RESULTS: The hospitalization rate was higher for male gender (56.56%) and for older age patients of both sexes. Overall, the lethality rate was quite high (41.28%) among hospitalized patients, especially those over 60 years of age. Most prevalent symptoms were cough, dyspnoea, fever, low oxygen saturation and respiratory distress. Cardiac disease, diabetes, obesity, kidney disease, neurological disease, and pneumopathy were the most prevalent comorbidities. A high prevalence of hospitalized COVID-19 patients with cardiac disease (65.7%) and diabetes (53.55%) and with a high lethality rate of around 50% was observed. The intensive care unit (ICU) admission rate was 39.37% and of these 62.4% died. 24.4% of patients required invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV), with high mortality among them (82.98%). The main mortality risk predictors were older age and IMV requirement. In addition, socioeconomic conditions have been shown to significantly influence the disease outcome, regardless of age and comorbidities. CONCLUSION: Our study provides a comprehensive overview of the hospitalized Brazilian COVID-19 patients profile and the mortality risk factors. The analysis also evidenced that the disease outcome is influenced by multiple factors, as unequally affects different segments of population.","de Souza, Fernanda Sumika Hojo; Hojo-Souza, Natália Satchiko; Batista, Ben Dêivide de Oliveira; da Silva, Cristiano Maciel; Guidoni, Daniel Ludovico",PLoS One,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0248580; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33735272/,402

Continuity of care with established patients as well as establishment of a professional relationship with new patients is challenging during this Public Health Emergency (PHE). Many geographic areas are under “stay at home” or “shelter in place” directives from state and local governments to avoid COVID-19 exposure risks. Medicare has recently allowed “broad flexibilities to furnish services using remote communications technology to avoid exposure risks to health care providers, patients, and the community.” [1] The implementation of telemedicine, or virtual, services, will help the Otolaryngologists provide needed care to patients while mitigating the clinical and financial impact of the pandemic. The significant coding and billing issues related to implementing telemedicine services are discussed to promote acceptance of this technology by the practicing Otolaryngologist. Of particular importance, outpatient visit Current Procedural Terminology® codes (99201-99215) may be used for telehealth visits performed in real-time audio and video.","Pollock, Kim; Setzen, Michael; Svider, Peter F.",Am J Otolaryngol,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.amjoto.2020.102490; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0196070920301721; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32307192/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0196070920301721?v=s5,402

The COVID-19 global pandemic and uncertainty about the origin of the causative virus illustrates both immediacy and the potential geopolitical implications of such technologies. These new gene editing techniques include one which has garnered a great deal of attention, the Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR) systems, as well as other, less well-known ones. CRISPR is not the first type of gene editing technology, but it is the most well-known within national and international security debates. Such advancements now allow for easier and more tunable manipulation of the genetic code of life with implications for governance of science and technology and with international security significance in the context of proliferation, deterrence, and unconventional weapons.

638783,Acute Thrombotic Events as Initial Presentation of Patients with COVID-19 infection,2020-06-17,"PURPOSE: This paper aims to measure the technical efficiency of China’s medical and health institutions from 2012 to 2017 and outline the path to achieve high-quality development. METHODS: The DEA-Malmquist was used to evaluate the total factor productivity of medical and health institutions in 31 provinces. A fuzzy set Qualitative Comparative Analysis (fsQCA) was used for configuration analysis of determinants affecting technical efficiency. RESULTS: The average total factor productivity (TFP) of those institutions was 0.965, namely TFP declined averagely by 3.5% annually. The efficiency change and the technical change were 0.998 and 0.967, respectively. The realization paths of high technical efficiency are composed of high fatality rate and high financial allocation-led, high population density and high GDP-led. Low dependency ratio and low financial allocation-led, low fatality rate and low financial allocation-led are the main reasons for low technical efficiency. CONCLUSION: Due to advanced medical technology and economic development, major cities like Beijing, Shanghai, and Guangdong have attracted a large number of high-level health personnel, achieving long-term and stable health business growth. Hubei, Anhui, and Sichuan also have made rapid development of health care through appropriate financial subsidies and policy supports. The technical changes in Qinghai, Yunnan, and Inner Mongolia are higher than the national average, but the operation and management level of the medical and health institutions is relatively weak. Henan, Jiangxi, and Heilongjiang have a prominent performance in the efficiency change, but the technical change is weaker than the national average.","Li, Zhiguang; Zhang, Wanying; Kong, Aijie; Ding, Zhiyuan; Wei, Hua; Guo, Yige",Risk Manag Healthc Policy,https://doi.org/10.2147/rmhp.s282178; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33447109/,402

However, it is not without complications, some of which can be trivial while others can lead to significant morbidity, especially in geriatric patients. Severe capsular contracture, implant failure, infection, or suspected breast implant-associated anaplastic large cell lymphoma are examples of complications that will eventually require explantation in most cases. As patients with implant-based reconstruction age, the risk of complications increases, which should be considered by treating physicians. We describe the case of a 90-year-old patient who presented to our emergency department after a fall with worsening confusion, which was attributed to a 60-year-old left breast implant rupture and a peri-implant infected hematoma confirmed with CT and ultrasound.","Mohammed, Ali K; Monib, Sherif",Cureus,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33833920/; https://doi.org/10.7759/cureus.13700,402
640169,The prognostic value of IL-8 for the death of severe or critical patients with COVID-19,2021-03-19,"BACKGROUND: Lung ultrasound score (LUS) as well as radiographic assessment of lung edema (RALE) score as calculated from chest radiography (CXR) have been applied to assess Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) severity. CXRs, which are frequently performed in ARDS patients, pose a greater risk of radiation exposure to patients and health care staff. AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: The aim of the study was to evaluate if LUS had a better correlation to oxygenation (PaO(2)/FiO(2)) compared with the RALE score in ARDS patients. We also aimed to analyse if there was a correlation between RALE score and LUS. We wanted to determine the LUS and RALE score cut-off, which could predict a prolonged length of intensive care unit (ICU) stay (≥10 days) and survival. METHODS: Thirty-seven patients aged above 18 years with ARDS as per Berlin definition and admitted to the ICU were included in the study. It was a retrospective study done over a period of 11 months. On the day of admission to ICU, the global and basal LUS, global and basal RALE score, and PaO(2) /FiO(2) were recorded. Outcome and days of ICU stay were noted. RESULTS: Global LUS score and PaO(2)/FiO(2) showed the best negative correlation (r = –0.491), which was significant (p = 0.002), followed by global RALE score and PaO(2)/FiO(2) (r = –0.422, p = 0.009). Basal LUS and PaO(2)/FiO(2) also had moderate negative correlation (r = –0.334, p = 0.043) followed by basal RALE score and PaO(2)/FiO(2) (r = –0.34, p = 0.039). Global RALE score and global LUS did not show a significant correlation. Similarly, there was no significant correlation between basal RALE score and basal LUS. Global and basal LUS as well as global and basal RALE score were not beneficial in predicting either a prolonged length of ICU stay or survival as the area under curve was low. CONCLUSION: In ARDS patients, global LUS had the best correlation to oxygenation (PaO(2)/FiO(2)), followed by global RALE score. Basal LUS and basal RALE score also had moderate correlation to oxygenation. However, there was no significant correlation between global LUS and global RALE score as well as between basal LUS and basal RALE score. Global and basal LUS as well as global and basal RALE scores were not able to predict a prolonged ICU stay or survival in ARDS patients.","Todur, Pratibha; Srikant, N; Prakash, Prabha",Can J Respir Ther,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34041358/; https://doi.org/10.29390/cjrt-2020-063,402

Early recognition of ARDS modified risk factors and avoidance of aggravating factors during hospital stay such as nonprotective mechanical ventilation, multiple blood products transfusions, positive fluid balance, ventilator-associated pneumonia, and gastric aspiration can help decrease its incidence. An early extensive clinical, laboratory, and imaging evaluation of “at risk patients” allows a correct diagnosis of ARDS, assessment of comorbidities, and calculation of prognostic indices, so that a careful treatment can be planned. Rapid administration of antibiotics and resuscitative measures in case of sepsis and septic shock associated with protective ventilatory strategies and early short-term paralysis associated with differential ventilatory techniques (recruitment maneuvers with adequate positive end-expiratory pressure titration, prone position, and new extracorporeal membrane oxygenation techniques) in severe ARDS can help improve its prognosis. Revaluation of ARDS patients on the third day of evolution (Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA), biomarkers and response to infection therapy) allows changes in the initial treatment plans and can help decrease ARDS mortality.","Barbas, Carmen Sílvia Valente; Matos, Gustavo Faissol Janot; Amato, Marcelo Britto Passos; Carvalho, Carlos Roberto Ribeiro",Crit Care Res Pract,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22957224/; https://doi.org/10.1155/2012/952168,402

OBJECTIVE: To analyze the clinical characteristics of elderly patients with 2019 new-type coronavirus pneumonia (COVID-19). METHODS: This is a retrospective study of patients with new coronavirus pneumonia (COVID-19) who were hospitalized in Hainan Provincial People's Hospital from January 15, 2020 to February 18, 2020. Compare the clinical characteristics of elderly with Young and Middle-aged patients. RESULTS: A total of 56 patients were enrolled 18 elderly patients (32.14%), and 38 young and middle-aged patients (67.86%). The most common symptoms in both groups were fever, followed by cough and sputum. Four patients in the elderly group received negative pressure ICU for mechanical ventilation, and five patients in the young and middle-aged group. One patient died in the elderly group (5.56%), and two patients died in the young and middle-aged group (5.26%). The PSI score of the elderly group was higher than that of the young and middle-aged group (P < 0.001). The proportion of patients with PSI grades IV and V was significantly higher in the elderly group than in the young and middle-aged group (P < 0.05). The proportion of multiple lobe involvement in the elderly group was higher than that in the young and middle-aged group (P < 0.001), and there was no difference in single lobe lesions between the two groups. The proportion of lymphocytes in the elderly group was significantly lower than that in the young and middle-aged group (P < 0.001), and the C-reactive protein was significantly higher in the young group (P < 0.001).

Its intestinal expression depends on co-expression of the membrane-anchored peptidase angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and is additionally enhanced by aminopeptidase N (CD13). We investigated in this study the expression of B(0)AT1 and its auxiliary peptidases as well as its transport function along the rat small intestine. Additionally, we tested its possible short- and long-term regulation by dietary proteins and amino acids. We showed by immunofluorescence that B(0)AT1, ACE2 and CD13 co-localize on the luminal membrane of small intestinal villi and by Western blotting that their protein expression increases in distal direction. Furthermore, we observed an elevated transport activity of the neutral amino acid L-isoleucine during the nocturnal active phase compared to the inactive one. Gastric emptying was delayed by intragastric application of an amino acid cocktail but we observed no acute dietary regulation of B(0)AT1 protein expression and L-isoleucine transport. Investigation of the chronic dietary regulation of B(0)AT1, ACE2 and CD13 by different diets revealed an increased B(0)AT1 protein expression under amino acid-supplemented diet in the proximal section but not in the distal one and for ACE2 protein expression a reverse localization of the effect. Dietary regulation for CD13 protein expression was not as distinct as for the two other proteins. Ring uptake experiments showed a tendency for increased L-isoleucine uptake under amino acid-supplemented diet and in vivo L-isoleucine absorption was more efficient under high protein and amino acid-supplemented diet. Additionally, plasma levels of branched-chain amino acids were elevated under high protein and amino acid diet. Taken together, our experiments did not reveal an acute amino acid-induced regulation of B(0)AT1 but revealed a chronic dietary adaptation mainly restricted to the proximal segment of the small intestine.","Jando, Julia; Camargo, Simone M.

Hence in this study, we have aimed to identify criteria for monitoring Knowledge Translation (KT) capacity within countries. METHODS: We conducted a web-based Delphi with over 120 public health professionals from 45 countries to reach agreement on criteria to monitor KT at the level of national HIS. Public health professionals participated in three survey rounds, in which they ranked 85 preselected criteria and could suggest additional criteria. RESULTS: Experts working in national (public) health agencies and statistical offices, as well as in health policy and care agreed on 29 criteria which constitute the Health Information (HI)-Impact Index. The criteria cover four essential domains of evaluation: the production of high-quality evidence, broad access and dissemination, stakeholder engagement and knowledge integration across sectors and in civil society. The HI-Impact Index was pretested by officials working in ministries of health and public health agencies in eight countries; they found the tool acceptable and user-friendly. CONCLUSIONS: The HI-Impact Index provides benchmarks to monitor KT so that countries can assess whether high-quality evidence can be easily accessed and used by the relevant stakeholders in health policy and practice, by civil society and across sectors. Next steps include further refining the procedure for conducting the assessment in routine, and sharing experiences from HIS evaluations using the HI-Impact Index.","Delnord, Marie; Abboud, Linda A; Costa, Claudia; Van Oyen, Herman",Eur J Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34333628/; https://doi.org/10.1093/eurpub/ckab117,402

Both pathogens and symbionts establish plant-microbe interactions using fascinating intricate extracellular strategies to avoid recognition. Here we distinguish nine different extracellular strategies to avoid recognition by the host, acting at three different levels. To avoid the accumulation of MAMP precursors (Level 1), microbes take advantage of polymorphisms in both MAMP proteins and glycans, or downregulate MAMP production. To reduce hydrolytic MAMP release (Level 2), microbes shield MAMP precursors with proteins or glycans and inhibit or degrade host-derived hydrolases. And to prevent MAMP perception directly (Level 3), microbes degrade or sequester MAMPs before they are perceived. We discuss examples of these nine strategies and envisage three additional extracellular strategies to avoid MAMP perception in plants.","Buscaill, Pierre; van der Hoorn, Renier A.

To provide a comprehensive response, top-down models have incorporated the critical role played by citizen-volunteers in assisting communities in distress. However, few post-crisis response models have identified new social actors who can contribute with creative, coordinated, and sustainable solutions. In this article, we present the case study of the 2017 Mexican earthquakes and the post-disaster activities developed by an emergent group of social actors — reading mediators. We argue for the critical role of mediators and their use of children’s literature and arts-based practices as essential instruments for community reconstruction. Drawing upon a case study methodology, we share the mediators’ post-disaster activities and experiences in four stages: immediate recovery, stabilisation, development and consolidation. We argue that such cultural interventions are essential in assisting communities recover and build resilience and, more importantly, new social actors such as reading mediators need further formal and institutional support. In this sense, el Protocolo, the cultural protocol developed in response to the mediators’ work, stands as an exemplary model that complements the emergent and distributed actions of reading mediators. As a whole, the Mexican cultural response provides a unique comprehensive approach that could be modeled in other contexts to address the needs of all citizens in vulnerable post-disaster circumstances.","Hirsu, Lavinia; Arizpe, Evelyn; McAdam, Julie",International journal of disaster risk reduction : IJDRR,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32834977/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijdrr.2020.101797; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2212420920312991?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2212420920312991,402

Pretendemos desarrollar un modelo de predicción de infección por COVID19 en provincias españolas. Método: Análisis de componentes principales funcional a datos epidemiológicos de las provincias españolas en función de su curva epidémica entre el 24 de febrero y el 8 de junio. Con este método se han clasificado las provincias en función de su evolución (peor, intermedia y mejor). Se han empleado los datos del Centro Nacional de Epidemiología. Resultados: Se identificaron dos componentes que explican el 99% de la variabilidad de las 52 curvas. La primera componente es la tendencia global de la tasa de incidencia, y la segunda componente es la velocidad de crecimiento o decrecimiento de la incidencia durante el período. Se identificaron 10 provincias en el grupo de peor evolución y 17 en el de evolución intermedia. Los valores umbrales de la tasa de incidencia a 7 días fueron 134 casos/100.000 habitantes para un nivel de alerta 1 (medio) y 167 para el nivel 2 (alto), consiguiendo un elevado poder de discriminación entre provincias. Conclusiones: Estos niveles de alerta podrían ser de utilidad para decidir medidas que puedan afectar a la movilidad de la población, siempre y cuando haya una situación de transmisión comunitaria de SARS-CoV-2.

Methods: We applied main components analysis to epidemiological data for Spanish provinces obtained from the National Centre of Epidemiology, based on the epidemiological curve between 24 February and 8 June 2020. Using this method, we classified provinces according to their epidemiological progress (worst, intermediate, and good). Results: We identified two components that explained 99% of variability in the 52 epidemiological curves. The first component can be interpreted as the crude incidence rate trend and the second component as the speed of increase or decrease in the incidence rate during the period analysed. We identified 10 provinces in the group with the worst progress and 17 in the intermediate group. The threshold values for the 7-day incidence rate for an alert 1 (intermediate) were 134 cases/100,000 inhabitants, and 167 for alert 2 (high), respectively, showing a high discriminative power between provinces. Conclusions: These alert levels might be useful for deciding which measures may affect population mobility and other public health decisions when considering community transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in a given geographical area. This information would also facilitate intercomparison between healthcare areas and Autonomous Communities.","Pérez, María Isolina Santiago; López-Vizcaíno, Esther; Ruano-Ravina, Alberto; Pérez-Ríos, Mónica",Arch Bronconeumol,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.arbres.2020.12.036; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34629639/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0300289621000223; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0300289621000223?v=s5,402
645144,Prevalence and Impact of Myocardial Injury in Patients Hospitalized with COVID-19 Infection,2020-06-08,"[Image: see text] The urgent need for a cure for early phase COVID-19 infected patients critically underlines drug repositioning strategies able to efficiently identify new and reliable treatments by merging computational, experimental, and pharmacokinetic expertise. Here we report new potential therapeutics for COVID-19 identified with a combined virtual and experimental screening strategy and selected among already approved drugs. We used hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), one of the most studied drugs in current clinical trials, as a reference template to screen for structural similarity against a library of almost 4000 approved drugs. The top-ranked drugs, based on structural similarity to HCQ, were selected for in vitro antiviral assessment. Among the selected drugs, both zuclopenthixol and nebivolol efficiently block SARS-CoV-2 infection with EC(50) values in the low micromolar range, as confirmed by independent experiments. The anti-SARS-CoV-2 potential of ambroxol, amodiaquine, and its active metabolite (N-monodesethyl amodiaquine) is also discussed. In trying to understand the “hydroxychloroquine” mechanism of action, both pK(a) and the HCQ aromatic core may play a role. Further, we show that the amodiaquine metabolite and, to a lesser extent, zuclopenthixol and nebivolol are active in a SARS-CoV-2 titer reduction assay. Given the need for improved efficacy and safety, we propose zuclopenthixol, nebivolol, and amodiaquine as potential candidates for clinical trials against the early phase of the SARS-CoV-2 infection and discuss their potential use as adjuvant to the current (i.e., remdesivir and favipiravir) COVID-19 therapeutics.","Bocci, Giovanni; Bradfute, Steven B.; Ye, Chunyan; Garcia, Matthew J.; Parvathareddy, Jyothi; Reichard, Walter; Surendranathan, Surekha; Bansal, Shruti; Bologa, Cristian G.; Perkins, Douglas J.; Jonsson, Colleen B.; Sklar, Larry A.; Oprea, Tudor I.",ACS Pharmacol Transl Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33330842/; https://doi.org/10.1021/acsptsci.0c00131,402

It is shown that regular yoga practice is coupled with improved impulse control, sustained attention, attenuated antisocial and self-harm behaviors, reduced stress, and psychological distress. No academic research until now has provided evidence of mental health benefits of yoga for institutionalized young people. In Sweden, each year more than thousand adolescents receive compulsory care at juvenile institutions run by the Swedish National Board of Institutional Care. These young people are characterized by substance abuse, aggressive and antisocial behaviors, high frequency of self-harm, and the experience of abuse. Most of them manifest attention problems, depression, anxiety, and impulsivity. They have a dramatically increased risk for recidivistic criminal behavior, continuous medical, and social care and untimely death. The present study plan aims at evaluating, with previously validated psychological measures, in a quasi-experimental design, the effects of yoga practice for institutionalized adolescents. Adolescents' experiences of participating in yoga practice will also be assessed by semi-structured individual interviews. Ethical approval was given by the Swedish Ethical Review Authority. It is hypothesized that yoga practice (in combination with the standard treatment within institutional care) will reduce institutionalized adolescents' aggression, antisocial behavior, anxiety, depression, and negative affect, and increase their cognitive flexibility (in the form of increased impulse control).","Kerekes, Nóra",Front Psychiatry,https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2021.575147; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34149466/,402

With limited in-person opportunities in the 2020-2021 application cycle, applicants have been pressed to gauge chances and best fit by browsing program websites. OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to assess the accessibility and content of accredited orthopedic surgery residency program websites during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Using the online database of the Electronic Residency Application Service (ERAS), we compiled a list of accredited orthopedic surgery residency programs in the United States. Program websites were evaluated across four domains: program overview, education, research opportunities, and application details. Each website was assessed twice in July 2020, during a period of adjustment to the COVID-19 pandemic, and twice in November 2020, following the October ERAS application deadline. RESULTS: A total of 189 accredited orthopedic surgery residency programs were identified through ERAS. Of these programs, 3 (1.6%) did not have functional website links on ERAS. Data analysis of content in each domain revealed that most websites included program details, a description of the didactic curriculum, and sample rotation schedules. Between the two evaluation periods in July and November 2020, the percentage of program websites containing informative videos and virtual tours rose from 12.2% (23/189) to 48.1% (91/189; P<.001) and from 0.5% (1/189) to 13.2% (25/189; P<.001), respectively. However, the number of programs that included information about a virtual subinternship or virtual interview on their websites did not change. Over the 4-month period, larger residency programs with 5 or more residents were significantly more likely to add a program video (P<.001) or virtual tour (P<.001) to their websites. CONCLUSIONS: Most residency program websites offered program details and an overview of educational and research opportunities; however, few addressed the virtual transition of interviews and subinternships during the COVID-19 pandemic.","El Shatanofy, Muhammad; Brown, Lauryn; Berger, Peter; Gu, Alex; Sharma, Abhinav K; Campbell, Joshua; Tabaie, Sean",JMIR Med Educ,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34449406/; https://doi.org/10.2196/30821,402

The distribution of pathogens in the sputum specimens was applied for retrospective analysis. Meanwhile, 110 patients diagnosed with COVID-19, but without pulmonary infection were regarded as the asymptomatic group. The risk factors of pulmonary infection were analyzed with generalized linear models and logistic regression. The pathogens in the lung infection group were mainly gram-negative bacteria (22, 68.8%), especially Klebsiella pneumoniae. Gram-positive bacteria and fungi accounted for 13 (40.6%), mainly Staphylococcus aureus, and 11 (34.4%), mainly Candida albicans. There were 14 cases (43.8%) infected with two or more pathogens. The comparison between the two groups found that, patients with elder age, underlying diseases, more lung lesions and low protein contents, were more likely to develop lung infections. At last, univariate analysis showed that 6 factors, including indwelling gastric catheter, the number of deep vein catheters, tracheal intubation tracheotomy, invasive mechanical ventilation, hormonal application, and the use of more than three antibacterial drugs, are risk factors for COVID-19 secondary pulmonary infection. Generalized linear models and logistic regression analysis showed antimicrobial use as an independent risk factor for COVID-19 secondary lung infection. There are many risk factors for secondary lung infection in severe COVID-19 patients, and it is recommended to use antibiotics reasonably.","Tang, Haicheng; Zhao, Zhangyan; Zhang, Xiaolin; Pan, Lei; Wu, Qingguo; Wang, Mei; Zhang, Yunbin; Li, Feng",Microb Pathog,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0882401021001753?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33940134/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0882401021001753; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.micpath.2021.104903,402

In this case series, we present our COVID‐19 telehealth rehabilitation programme, delivered within a PR setting, and discuss the management of our first three cases. All patients were male, with a median age of 73 years. Following hospital discharge, the patients presented with persistent limitations and/or symptoms (e.g. breathlessness, fatigue, and reduced exercise capacity) which warranted community‐based rehabilitation. Patients were assessed and provided with an initial six‐week rehabilitation programme supported via telehealth using a treatable traits approach. Patients demonstrated improvements in exercise capacity and breathlessness; however, fatigue levels worsened in two cases and this was attributed to the difficulties of managing returning to work and/or carer responsibilities whilst trying to recover from a severe illness. We found that PR clinicians were well prepared and able to provide an individualized rehabilitation programme for people recovering from COVID‐19.","Wootton, Sally L.; King, Meredith; Alison, Jennifer A.; Mahadev, Sri; Chan, Andrew S.

METHODS: A total of 53 septic patients and 16 normal controls who were admitted to the Affiliated Hospital of Southwest Medical University between January 2019 and December 2020 were enrolled in this study; 6 specimens from the normal group and 15 from the sepsis group were randomly selected for DIA-based quantitative proteomic analysis. The acquired data were subjected to Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analysis, and a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network was constructed to screen potential markers. The selected proteins were further verified through ELISAs. The differences between control and sepsis groups and between survivors and non-survivors were analysed. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were drawn to explore their diagnostic value and prognostic efficacy. RESULTS: A total of 149 DEPs were identified by bioinformatics methods. The analyses showed that these proteins are mainly involved in biological processes such as cell movement, stress response, cell proliferation, and immune response. Functional pathway analysis showed that they are mainly involved in leukocyte transendothelial migration, protein synthesis and processing, and various bacterial infections. LGALS3BP was selected as a potential plasma biomarker and further verified through an ELISA. Its level in septic patients was significantly higher than that in normal controls, and its level in non-survivors was also higher than that in survivors. The ROC curves suggested its great diagnostic efficacy and prognostic ability in sepsis. CONCLUSION: LGALS3BP levels were significantly different between the normal and sepsis groups; it has good diagnostic value in sepsis, and is related to patient prognosis; thus, it might be a biomarker for sepsis.","Luo, Meiyan; Zhang, Qian; Hu, Yingchun; Sun, Changfeng; Sheng, Yunjian; Deng, Cunliang",Infect Drug Resist,https://doi.org/10.2147/idr.s316402; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34335032/,402
647410,Acute limb ischemia in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia,2020-04-29,"Novel coronavirus or COVID-19 is a viral illness that can cause severe respiratory symptoms. It spreads between people through direct, indirect (through contaminated objects or surfaces), or close contact with infected people via mouth and nose secretions. COVID-19 has caused a worldwide pandemic that necessitated many countries to perform a national lockdown. In Jordan, a complete lockdown was imposed by the government on March 17th, 2020 and continued for more than two months. The lockdown included every single sector in the country. Hospitals were only dealing with outpatient emergency cases, urgent referrals from primary or secondary health institutions and with inpatients whose medical conditions required keeping them admitted. Elective clinics and surgeries were canceled. At the King Abdullah University Hospital (KAUH), which is the only tertiary center in northern Jordan, we dealt with four cases of traumatic eye injury that resulted in a ruptured globe. The four cases were for eyes that had a history of penetrating keratoplasty (PK) and were visually compromised in the involved eye compared to the other eye. The percentage of open globe injuries to the total number of emergency cases presented during the lockdown was significantly higher than the percentage of open globe injuries to the total number of emergency cases presented during the corresponding period in the previous year (p=0.0005). We believe the lockdown inside homes has resulted in higher risk of trauma and rupture globe in this group of patients.","Alqudah, Asem A; Al Dwairi, Rami A; Alqudah, Noor M; Abumurad, Sumayyah K",Int Med Case Rep J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33116940/; https://doi.org/10.2147/imcrj.s274284,402

Our aims were to analyze epidemiological characteristics of infants with bronchiolitis over 10 consecutive seasons and to evaluate whether there are any clinical differences between infants hospitalized for bronchiolitis during epidemic peak months and infants in non‐peak months. We enrolled consecutive enrolled 723 previously healthy term infants hospitalized at the Paediatric Emergency Department, “Sapienza” University of Rome over the period 2004–2014. Fourteen respiratory viruses were detected from nasopharyngeal aspirates by molecular methods. Clinical and demographic data were extracted from clinical charts. Viruses were detected in 351 infants (48.5%): RSV in 234 (32.4%), RV in 44 (6.1%), hBoV in 11 (1.5%), hMPV in 12 (1.6%), co‐infections in 39 (5.4%), and other viruses in 11 (1.5%). Analyzing the 10 epidemic seasons, we found higher incidence for bronchiolitis every 4 years with a peak during the months December–January. Infants hospitalized during peak months had lower family history for asthma (P = 0.003), more smoking mothers during pregnancy (P = 0.036), were slightly higher breastfed (0.056), had lower number of blood eosinophils (P = 0.015) and had a higher clinical severity score (P = 0.017). RSV was detected mostly during peak months, while RV was equally distributed during the seasons. We found some variations in bronchiolitis incidence during epidemics, and discriminative characteristics in infants hospitalized for bronchiolitis during peak months and in non‐peak months, that might reflect two different populations of children.

We had the opportunity to study the placental pathology of five full-term births to COVID-19 patients. All five exhibited histology indicative of fetal vascular malperfusion characterized by focal avascular villi and thrombi in larger fetal vessels. Vascular complement deposition in the placentas was not abnormal, and staining for viral RNA and viral spike protein was negative. While all cases resulted in healthy, term deliveries, these findings indicate the systemic nature of COVID-19 infection. The finding of vascular thrombosis without complement deposition may reflect the systemic nature of COVID-19's procoagulant effects unrelated to systemic complement activation.","Mulvey, J.

Although they offer a comprehensive perspective, they overlook two essential aspects. First, while the authors consider the possibility that immunological passports may appear to discriminate against those who do not possess them, the opposite viewpoint of immune people is underdeveloped. We argue that if a person has been tested positive for and recovered from COVID-19, becoming immune to it, she cannot be considered a hazard to public health and, therefore, the curtailment of her fundamental rights (eg, the right to freedom of movement) is not legitimate. Second, they omit that vaccine distribution will create similar problems related to immunity-based licenses. Vaccine certificates will de facto generate a sort of immunity passport. In the next phases of the pandemic, different immunity statuses will be at stake, because the need to identify who can spread COVID-19 is unavoidable. If a person does not pose a threat to public health because she cannot spread the infection, then her right to freedom of movement should be respected, regardless of how she acquired that immunity.","de Miguel Beriain, Iñigo; Rueda, Jon",J Med Ethics,https://doi.org/10.1136/medethics-2020-106814; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32907831/,402

The COVID-19 pandemic has changed the context of practice and the option of returning home for cervical ripening may now assume greater significance. This work aimed to examine whether and how the COVID-19 pandemic has changed practice around IOL in the UK. Method We used an online questionnaire to survey senior obstetricians and midwives at all 156 UK NHS Trusts and Boards that currently offer maternity services. Responses were analysed to produce descriptive statistics, with free text responses analysed using a conventional content analysis approach. Findings Responses were received from 92 of 156 UK Trusts and Boards, a 59% response rate. Many Trusts and Boards reported no change to their IOL practice, however 23% reported change in methods used for cervical ripening; 28% a change in criteria for home cervical ripening; 28% stated that more women were returning home during cervical ripening; and 24% noted changes to womens response to recommendations for IOL. Much of the change was reported as happening in response to attempts to minimise hospital attendance and restrictions on birth partners accompanying women. Conclusions The pandemic has changed practice around induction of labour, although this varied significantly between NHS Trusts and Boards. There is a lack of formal evidence to support decision-making around outpatient cervical ripening: the basis on which changes were implemented and what evidence was used to inform decisions is not clear.","Harkness, M.; Yuill, C.; Cheyne, H.; Stock, S.; McCourt, C.",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.01.27.21250521; http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.27.21250521v1?rss=1,402

The literature on the topic is still fragmented; the features of the emerging paradigm appear to be a contested territory among different academic disciplines. This study assumes a value chain perspective to analyze the evolutionary trajectories of manufacturing companies. We developed a Delphi-based scenario analysis involving 76 experts from academia and practice. The results highlight the most common expectations as well as controversial issues in terms of emerging business models, size, barriers to entry, vertical integration, rent distribution, and geographical location of activities. Eight scenarios provide a concise outlook on the range of possible futures. These scenarios are based on four main drivers which stem from the experts’ comments: demand characteristics, transparency of data among value chain participants, maturity of additive manufacturing and advanced robotics, and penetration of smart products. Researchers can derive from our study a series of hypotheses and opportunities for future research on Industry 4.0.

We aimed to assess the ability of transcriptomic biomarkers to identify naturally acquired respiratory viral infection before typical symptoms are present. METHODS: In this index-cluster study, we prospectively recruited a cohort of undergraduate students (aged 18–25 years) at Duke University (Durham, NC, USA) over a period of 5 academic years. To identify index cases, we monitored students for the entire academic year, for the presence and severity of eight symptoms of respiratory tract infection using a daily web-based survey, with symptoms rated on a scale of 0–4. Index cases were defined as individuals who reported a 6-point increase in cumulative daily symptom score. Suspected index cases were visited by study staff to confirm the presence of reported symptoms of illness and to collect biospecimen samples. We then identified clusters of close contacts of index cases (ie, individuals who lived in close proximity to index cases, close friends, and partners) who were presumed to be at increased risk of developing symptomatic respiratory tract infection while under observation. We monitored each close contact for 5 days for symptoms and viral shedding and measured transcriptomic responses at each timepoint each day using a blood-based 36-gene RT-PCR assay. FINDINGS: Between Sept 1, 2009, and April 10, 2015, we enrolled 1465 participants. Of 264 index cases with respiratory tract infection symptoms, 150 (57%) had a viral cause confirmed by RT-PCR. Of their 555 close contacts, 106 (19%) developed symptomatic respiratory tract infection with a proven viral cause during the observation window, of whom 60 (57%) had the same virus as their associated index case. Nine viruses were detected in total. The transcriptomic assay accurately predicted viral infection at the time of maximum symptom severity (mean area under the receiver operating characteristic curve [AUROC] 0·94 [95% CI 0·92–0·96]), as well as at 1 day (0·87 [95% CI 0·84–0·90]), 2 days (0·85 [0·82–0·88]), and 3 days (0·74 [0·71–0·77]) before peak illness, when symptoms were minimal or absent and 22 (62%) of 35 individuals, 25 (69%) of 36 individuals, and 24 (82%) of 29 individuals, respectively, had no detectable viral shedding. INTERPRETATION: Transcriptional biomarkers accurately predict and diagnose infection across diverse viral causes and stages of disease and thus might prove useful for guiding the administration of early effective therapy, quarantine decisions, and other clinical and public health interventions in the setting of endemic and pandemic infectious diseases.

The Oregon Health Authority ScreenWise Program reached out to our academic-community research team to explore Asians and Micronesian Islanders (MI) perceptions on public health education outreach on GCS due to having previously only worked with the Latinx community. The purpose of the qualitative description pilot study was to elicit perceptions, beliefs, experiences, and recommendations from Asian and MI community leaders and community members regarding family health history GCS outreach in communities. Twenty Asians (Chinese and Vietnamese) and Micronesian Islanders (Chuukese and Marshallese) were recruited from the US Pacific Northwest. Nineteen participants are immigrants with an average 21.4 and 18.5 years having lived in the USA, respectively. Individual in-depth interviews were conducted using a semi-structured, open-ended interview guide and analyzed using conventional content analysis. Three main transcultural themes were identified: (1) degree of knowing and understanding cancer screening versus family health history GCS, (2) needing culturally relevant outreach messaging on family health history GCS, and (3) communication and decision-making regarding discussing with family and health care providers about cancer screening and GCS. Culturally relevant messaging rather than generic messaging is needed for inclusive outreach. Healthcare providers are encouraged to assess a client’s family health history routinely because Asian and MI clients may not understand the information requested, may be hesitant to offer, or unable to provide information about their personal or family history of cancer.","Nguyen-Truong, Connie Kim Yen; Davis, Andra; Vuong, Vananh Minh Nguyen; Nguyen, Kim Quy Vo; Truong, Anthony My; Leung, Jacqueline",J Cancer Educ,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34495435/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s13187-021-02085-0,402

This chapter establishes a holistic framework to define and evaluate smart cities through three core objectives that any city wants to improve—productivity, sustainability, and livability. Although smartness includes a wide range of aspects within a city, it should tackle the complexity of urban challenges internally and externally generated. Thus, adaptive capacity is becoming more and more important, requiring timely innovation. The chapter asserts cities are and should be a platform for technological and social innovation to enhance these three urban cores. Creating smart cities via innovation is not a one-way process, but reciprocal. Innovation can create smart built environments, and, in turn, smart cities engender innovation. There are many successful evidences and documented examples of both technology-oriented initiatives and social innovation strategies worldwide. However, there is limited understanding of the combined view on technological innovation or social innovation that can contribute to meeting urban challenges. Furthermore, how the urban future might benefit from interdependency and interactions of the elements in these two concepts has not been fully explored. The research will set an agenda for measurement of cities’ performance in productivity, sustainability, and livability from both technological and social innovation perspectives.","Kim, Hyung Min; Sabri, Soheil; Kent, Anthony",Smart Cities for Technological and Social Innovation,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/B9780128188866000022; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780128188866000022,402
653755,COVID‐19 patients exhibit reduced procoagulant platelet responses,2020-10-06,"Many environmental and biomedical biomonitoring and detection studies aim to explore the presence of specific organisms or gene functionalities in microbiome samples. In such cases, when the study hypotheses can be answered with the exploration of a small number of genes, a targeted PCR-approach is appropriate. However, due to the complexity of environmental microbial communities, the design of specific primers is challenging and can lead to non-specific results. We designed PhyloPrimer, the first user-friendly platform to semi-automate the design of taxon-specific oligos (i.e., PCR primers) for a gene of interest. The main strength of PhyloPrimer is the ability to retrieve and align GenBank gene sequences matching the user’s input, and to explore their relationships through an online dynamic tree. PhyloPrimer then designs oligos specific to the gene sequences selected from the tree and uses the tree non-selected sequences to look for and maximize oligo differences between targeted and non-targeted sequences, therefore increasing oligo taxon-specificity (positive/negative consensus approach). Designed oligos are then checked for the presence of secondary structure with the nearest-neighbor (NN) calculation and the presence of off-target matches with in silico PCR tests, also processing oligos with degenerate bases. Whilst the main function of PhyloPrimer is the design of taxon-specific oligos (down to the species level), the software can also be used for designing oligos to target a gene without any taxonomic specificity, for designing oligos from preselected sequences and for checking predesigned oligos. We validated the pipeline on four commercially available microbial mock communities using PhyloPrimer to design genus- and species-specific primers for the detection of Streptococcus species in the mock communities. The software performed well on these mock microbial communities and can be found at https://www.cerealsdb.uk.net/cerealgenomics/phyloprimer.","Varliero, Gilda; Wray, Jared; Malandain, Cédric; Barker, Gary",PeerJ,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33986979/; https://doi.org/10.7717/peerj.11120,402
653861,Biological and Clinical Factors Contributing to the Metabolic Heterogeneity of Hospitalized Patients with and without COVID-19,2021-09-02,"The aberrant release of inflammatory mediators often referred to as a cytokine storm or cytokine release syndrome (CRS), is a common and sometimes fatal complication in acute infectious diseases including Ebola, dengue, COVID‐19, and influenza. Fatal CRS occurrences have also plagued the development of highly promising cancer therapies based on T‐cell engagers and chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells. CRS is intimately linked with dysregulated and excessive cytokine release, including IFN‐γ, TNF‐α, IL 1, IL‐6, and IL‐10, resulting in a systemic inflammatory response leading to multiple organ failure. Here, we show that mice intravenously administered the agonistic hamster anti‐mouse CD3ε monoclonal antibody 145‐2C11 develop clinical and laboratory manifestations seen in patients afflicted with CRS, including body weight loss, hepatosplenomegaly, thrombocytopenia, increased vascular permeability, lung inflammation, and hypercytokinemia. Blood cytokine levels and gene expression analysis from lung, liver, and spleen demonstrated a hierarchy of inflammatory cytokine production and infiltrating immune cells with differentiating organ‐dependent kinetics. IL‐2, IFN‐γ, TNF‐α, and IL‐6 up‐regulation preceded clinical signs of CRS. The co‐treatment of mice with a neutralizing anti‐cytokine antibody cocktail transiently improved early clinical and laboratory features of CRS.

This study describes the current epidemiological status of MERS-CoV in the world. METHODS: Epidemiological analysis was performed on data derived from all MERS-CoV cases recorded in the disease outbreak news on WHO website between 1.1.2017 and 17.1.2018. Demographic and clinical information as well as potential contacts and probable risk factors for mortality were extracted based on laboratory-confirmed MERS-CoV cases. RESULTS: A total of 229 MERS-CoV cases, including 70 deaths (30.5%), were recorded in the disease outbreak news on world health organization website over the study period. Based on available details in this study, the case fatality rate in both genders was 30.5% (70/229) [32.1% (55/171) for males and 25.8% (15/58) for females]. The disease occurrence was higher among men [171 cases (74.7%)] than women [58 cases (25.3%)]. Variables such as comorbidities and exposure to MERS-CoV cases were significantly associated with mortality in people affected with MERS-CoV infections, and adjusted odds ratio estimates were 2.2 (95% CI: 1.16, 7.03) and 2.3 (95% CI: 1.35, 8.20), respectively. All age groups had an equal chance of mortality. CONCLUSIONS: In today’s “global village”, there is probability of MERS-CoV epidemic at any time and in any place without prior notice. Thus, health systems in all countries should implement better triage systems for potentially imported cases of MERS-CoV to prevent large epidemics.","Mobaraki, Kazhal; Ahmadzadeh, Jamal",BMC Infect Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31029095/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12879-019-3987-2,402

Deep-learning artificial intelligent (AI) methods have the potential to help improve diagnostic efficiency and accuracy for reading portable CXRs. PURPOSE: The study aimed at developing an AI imaging analysis tool to classify COVID-19 lung infection based on portable CXRs. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Public datasets of COVID-19 (N = 130), bacterial pneumonia (N = 145), non-COVID-19 viral pneumonia (N = 145), and normal (N = 138) CXRs were analyzed. Texture and morphological features were extracted. Five supervised machine-learning AI algorithms were used to classify COVID-19 from other conditions. Two-class and multi-class classification were performed. Statistical analysis was done using unpaired two-tailed t tests with unequal variance between groups. Performance of classification models used the receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. RESULTS: For the two-class classification, the accuracy, sensitivity and specificity were, respectively, 100%, 100%, and 100% for COVID-19 vs normal; 96.34%, 95.35% and 97.44% for COVID-19 vs bacterial pneumonia; and 97.56%, 97.44% and 97.67% for COVID-19 vs non-COVID-19 viral pneumonia. For the multi-class classification, the combined accuracy and AUC were 79.52% and 0.87, respectively.

Consequently, revealing the evolutionary and cognitive antecedents of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy and vaccination intention has become crucial. Drawing on the theory of behavioral immune system (BIS), we investigate whether perceived vulnerability to disease (PVD) is associated with vaccination intentions through the need for cognitive closure (NCC) and vaccine hesitancy. The data was collected from 525 adults from Turkey. The structural equation modeling results indicate that of the two dimensions of PVD, germ aversion predicts COVID-19 vaccination intention through sequential mediation of NCC and vaccine hesitancy. Perceived infectability, on the other hand, is directly and positively related to vaccination intention. By showing the mediating role of NCC, our results offer an insight as to why germ aversion translates into vaccine hesitancy, and low vaccination intention. We discuss the potential benefits of considering the roles of BIS and NCC in campaigns and policies targeted at increasing COVID-19 vaccine uptake and suggest implications for such practices.","Solak, Çağlar; Peker-Dural, Hilal; Karlidağ, Sercan; Peker, Mehmet",Pers Individ Dif,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0191886921006243?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34511678/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.paid.2021.111245; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0191886921006243,402

Methods We have functionally characterized the anti-SARS-CoV-2 hyperimmune immunoglobulin (hIG) prepared from human COVID-19 convalescent plasma. SARS-CoV-2 virus neutralization was evaluated by four different methodologies (plaque reduction, virus induced cytotoxicity, TCID50 reduction and immunofluorimetry-based methodology) performed at four different laboratories and using four geographically different SARS-CoV-2 isolates (one each from USA and Italy; two from Spain). Two of the isolates contained the D614G mutation. Neutralization capacity against the original Wuhan SARS-CoV-2 straom and variants (D614G mutant, B.1.1.7, P.1 and B.1.351 variants) was evaluated using a pseudovirus platform expressing the corresponding spike (S) protein. The capacity to induce antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) and antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis (ADCP) was also evaluated. Results All the SARS-CoV-2 isolates tested were effectively neutralized by hIG solutions. This was confirmed by all four methodologies showing potent neutralization capacity. Wild-type SARS-CoV-2 and variants were effectively neutralized as demonstrated using the pseudovirus platform. The hIG solutions had the capacity to induce ADCC and ADCP against SARS-CoV-2 N and S proteins but not the E protein. Under our experimental conditions, very low concentrations (25-100 µg IgG/mL) were required to induce both effects. Besides the S protein, we observed a clear and potent effect triggered by antibodies in the hIG solutions against the SARS-CoV-2 N protein. Conclusions These results show that, beyond neutralization, other IgG Fc-dependent pathways may play a role in the protection from and/or resolution of SARS-CoV-2 infection when using hIG COVID-19 products. This could be especially relevant for the treatment of more neutralization resistant SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern.","Díez, José María; Romero, Carolina; Cruz, María; Vandeberg, Peter; Merritt, W.

It is still unclear under which conditions employees in those facilities can safely pursue their work. Preventive workplace-related measures to reduce transmission dynamics in this work environment need to be developed. These measures need to build on a solid scientific foundation and be ready for practical use at the same time. Therefore, the aim of the study is to present a participatory approach to identify, minimize, and eliminate workplace-specific COVID-19 transmission within child care. The approach presented combines quantitative as well as qualitative elements and includes a screening of critical workplace conditions and the development of preventive measures to foster a safe workplace design. METHODS: First, 428 employees of different child care facilities in a large German city reported their subjective risk of infection, fear of infection, and support received by the employer. Second, the participants commented in detail about high risk conditions during work. Third, employees provided suggestions for preventive measures. We conducted a qualitative analysis of free text answers to evaluate which aspects are perceived as critical from an employee perspective. RESULTS: Participants provided valuable and practicable ideas on how to design and improve preventive measures to reduce COVID-19 transmission in child care dealing with structural conditions, the interaction with the parents, the implementation of preventive measures and recommendations for policy makers. CONCLUSIONS: These new insights help to organize pandemic risk management in order to align theoretical based measures with the practical realization.

659066,Editorial: COVID-19: A New Severe Infection,2021-07-28,"BACKGROUND: In the Île-de-France region (henceforth termed Greater Paris), extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) for severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) was considered early in the COVID-19 pandemic. We report ECMO network organisation and outcomes during the first wave of the pandemic. METHODS: In this multicentre cohort study, we present an analysis of all adult patients with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and severe ARDS requiring ECMO who were admitted to 17 Greater Paris intensive care units between March 8 and June 3, 2020. Central regulation for ECMO indications and pooling of resources were organised for the Greater Paris intensive care units, with six mobile ECMO teams available for the region. Details of complications (including ECMO-related complications, renal replacement therapy, and pulmonary embolism), clinical outcomes, survival status at 90 days after ECMO initiation, and causes of death are reported. Multivariable analysis was used to identify pre-ECMO variables independently associated with 90-day survival after ECMO. FINDINGS: The 302 patients included who underwent ECMO had a median age of 52 years (IQR 45−58) and Simplified Acute Physiology Score-II of 40 (31−56), and 235 (78%) of whom were men. 165 (55%) were transferred after cannulation by a mobile ECMO team. Before ECMO, 285 (94%) patients were prone positioned, median driving pressure was 18 cm H(2)O (14−21), and median ratio of the partial pressure of arterial oxygen to the fraction of inspired oxygen was 61 mm Hg (IQR 54−70). During ECMO, 115 (43%) of 270 patients had a major bleeding event, 27 of whom had intracranial haemorrhage; 130 (43%) of 301 patients received renal replacement therapy; and 53 (18%) of 294 had a pulmonary embolism. 138 (46%) patients were alive 90 days after ECMO. The most common causes of death were multiorgan failure (53 [18%] patients) and septic shock (47 [16%] patients). Shorter time between intubation and ECMO (odds ratio 0·91 [95% CI 0·84−0·99] per day decrease), younger age (2·89 [1·41−5·93] for ≤48 years and 2·01 [1·01−3·99] for 49–56 years vs ≥57 years), higher pre-ECMO renal component of the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score (0·67, 0·55−0·83 per point increase), and treatment in centres managing at least 30 venovenous ECMO cases annually (2·98 [1·46–6·04]) were independently associated with improved 90-day survival. There was no significant difference in survival between patients who had mobile and on-site ECMO initiation. INTERPRETATION: Beyond associations with similar factors to those reported on ECMO for non-COVID-19 ARDS, 90-day survival among ECMO-assisted patients with COVID-19 was strongly associated with a centre's experience in venovenous ECMO during the previous year. Early ECMO management in centres with a high venovenous ECMO case volume should be advocated, by applying centralisation and regulation of ECMO indications, which should also help to prevent a shortage of resources.

The obstacles in combating falsified pharmaceuticals include 1) lack of consensus on definitions, 2) paucity of reliable and scalable technology to detect fakes before they reach patients, 3) poor global and national leadership and accountability systems for combating this scourge, and 4) deficient manufacturing and regulatory challenges, especially in China and India where fake products often originate. The major needs to improve the quality of the world's medicines fall into three main areas: 1) research to develop and compare accurate and affordable tools to identify high-quality drugs at all levels of distribution; 2) an international convention and national legislation to facilitate production and utilization of high-quality drugs and protect all countries from the criminal and the negligent who make, distribute, and sell life-threatening products; and 3) a highly qualified, well-supported international science and public health organization that will establish standards, drug-quality surveillance, and training programs like the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Such leadership would give authoritative guidance for countries in cooperation with national medical regulatory agencies, pharmaceutical companies, and international agencies, all of which have an urgent interest and investment in ensuring that patients throughout the world have access to good quality medicines. The organization would also advocate strongly for including targets for achieving good quality medicines in the United Nations Millennium Development Goals and Sustainable Development Goals.","Nayyar, Gaurvika M.

Given the large quantity of primary literature, and time constraints faced by policy-makers and practitioners, well-conducted evidence reviews can provide a valuable resource to support decision-making. However, previous research suggests that some evidence reviews may not be sufficiently reliable to inform decisions in the environmental sector due to low standards of conduct and reporting. While some evidence reviews are of high reliability, there is currently no way for policy-makers and practitioners to quickly and easily find them among the many lower reliability ones. Alongside this lack of transparency, there is little incentive or support for review authors, editors and peer-reviewers to improve reliability. To address these issues, we introduce a new online, freely available and first-of-its-kind evidence service: the Collaboration for Environmental Evidence Database of Evidence Reviews (CEEDER: www.environmentalevidence.org/ceeder). CEEDER aims to transform communication of evidence review reliability to researchers, policy-makers and practitioners through independent assessment of key aspects of the conduct, reporting and data limitations of available evidence reviews claiming to assess environmental impacts or the effectiveness of interventions relevant to policy and practice. At the same time, CEEDER will provide support to improve the standards of future evidence reviews and support evidence translation and knowledge mobilisation to help inform environmental decision-making.","Konno, Ko; Cheng, Samantha H.; Eales, Jacqualyn; Frampton, Geoff; Kohl, Christian; Livoreil, Barbara; Macura, Biljana; O’Leary, Bethan C.; Randall, Nicola P.; Taylor, Jessica J.; Woodcock, Paul; Pullin, Andrew S.",Environ Sci Policy,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1462901120303993; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1462901120303993; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32922207/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envsci.2020.08.021,402

In this study, we constructed a recombinant porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (vP129/swIL1β) expressing swine IL-1β from the separate subgenomic mRNA inserted between the ORF1b and ORF2 genome region. MARC-145 cells infected with vP129/swIL1β secreted 1947 pg of IL-1β per 2 × 10(5) cells at 36 h post-infection. In vitro growth kinetics analysis in MARC-145 cells showed that the vP129/swIL1β virus had a similar replication rate as that of parental virus. We further performed in vivo characterization of the vP129/swIL1β virus in a nursery pig disease model. The vP129/swIL1β infected pigs did not show visible clinical signs, while respiratory distress and lethargy were evident in pigs infected with the parental virus. The expression of various cytokines from peripheral blood mononuclear cells measured by fluorescent microsphere immunoassay showed that IL-1β, IL-4 and IFN-γ expression levels were up-regulated in pigs infected with vP129/swIL1β at 7 and 14 days post-infection. However, no detectable level of IL-1β was found in serum samples from pigs infected with either vP129/swIL1β or parental virus. In summary, this study demonstrated a recombinant PRRSV as a useful tool to study the role of different cytokines in disease progression and immune responses, which represents a new strategy for future therapeutic application and vaccine development.","Lawson, Steven R.; Li, Yanhua; Patton, John B.; Langenhorst, Robert J.; Sun, Zhi; Jiang, Zhiyong; Christopher-Hennings, Jane; Nelson, Eric A.; Knudsen, David; Fang, Ying; Chang, Kyeong-Ok",Virus Res,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168170211004564; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22119401/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virusres.2011.11.007; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0168170211004564,402

The World Health Organization (WHO) has developed guidelines for responsible media reporting of suicide. The present study aimed to assess the quality of online media reporting of a recent celebrity suicide in India and its impact on the online suicide related search behaviour of the population. A total of 200 online media reports about Sushant Singh Rajput’s suicide published between 14(th) to 20(th) June, 2020 were assessed for quality of reporting following the checklist prepared using the WHO guidelines. Further, we examined the change in online suicide-seeking and help-seeking search behaviour of the population following celebrity suicide for the month of June using selected keywords. In terms of potentially harmful media reportage, 85.5% of online reports violated at least one WHO media reporting guideline. In terms of potentially helpful media reportage, only 13% articles provided information about where to seek help for suicidal thoughts or ideation. There was a significant increase in online suicide-seeking (U = 0.5, p < 0.05) and help-seeking (U = 6.5, p < 0.05) behaviour after the reference event, when compared to baseline. However, the online peak search interest for suicide-seeking was greater than help-seeking. This provides support for a strong Werther effect, possibly associated with poor quality of media reporting of celebrity suicide. There is an urgent need for taking steps to improve the quality of media reporting of suicide in India.","Ganesh, Ragul; Singh, Swarndeep; Mishra, Rajan; Sagar, Rajesh",Asian J Psychiatr,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32937236/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1876201820304937; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1876201820304937?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajp.2020.102380,402

BACKGROUND: Healthcare professionals are in the forefront of the COVID‐19 pandemic facing an unprecedented global health crisis, which can have consequences on their psychosocial health. There is a need to identify risk factors for poor psychosocial outcomes to inform the design of tailored psychological interventions. DESIGN: Cross‐sectional online study. METHODS: A total of 1071 healthcare professionals completed self‐report questionnaires. Measures included sociodemographic information, COVID‐19‐related characteristics, quality of life (Brief World Health Organization Quality of Life; WHOQOL‐Bref), anxiety (Generalized Anxiety Disorder‐7; GAD‐7), depression (Patient Health Questionnaire‐8; PHQ‐8), occupational burnout (Copenhagen Burnout Inventory; CBI), and coping (Brief Coping Orientation to Problems Experienced; Brief COPE). This article follows the STROBE reporting guidelines. RESULTS: The prevalence of moderate to severe anxiety and clinically significant depression was 27.6% and 26.8%, respectively. Significant risk factors for poor psychological outcomes included being female, being a nurse or doctor (vs non‐medical professional), working in frontline units (inpatient, intensive care), perceptions of inadequate workplace preparation to deal with the pandemic, and using avoidance coping. Depression and occupational burnout were significant risk factors for poor quality of life. CONCLUSION: The findings suggest several individual, psychosocial, and organisational risk factors for the adverse psychological outcomes observed in healthcare professionals during the COVID‐19 pandemic. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: This study highlights the urgent need for screening for anxiety and depression and psychological interventions to combat an imminent mental health crisis in healthcare professionals during the COVID‐19 pandemic. Pandemic response protocols and public health initiatives aiming to improve and prevent mental health problems in healthcare professionals during the current and future health crises, need to account for the various factors at play.","Fteropoulli, Theodora; Kalavana, Theano V.; Yiallourou, Anneza; Karaiskakis, Marios; Koliou Mazeri, Maria; Vryonides, Stavros; Hadjioannou, Anna; Nikolopoulos, Georgios K.",J Clin Nurs,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34231263/; https://doi.org/10.1111/jocn.15938,402

AIMS: The aim of our study was to investigate the impact SARS-CoV-2 and public health restrictions had on trauma presentations to a regional paediatric emergency service. METHODS: We carried out a multisite retrospective longitudinal study of all paediatric ED attendances from 2018 including 13 March to 7 June 2020. This aligned with the initial government-enforced public health phases: delay phase, mitigation phase and reopening phase 1. RESULTS: There were 7975 total regional attendances during government-enforced restrictions. This represents 17.5% and 15.6% reductions in site attendances when compared with the two previous years. Regional attendances reduced by 52.5% in 2020 compared with 2018 and 50.9% compared with 2019. Following an initial reduction in injury attendances at the beginning of the ‘lockdown’ (p = 0.076), the number of injuries consistently grew as weeks progressed (p < 0.05), reaching a peak of 44.6% of all attendances. As restrictions eased, the most common location where injuries occurred moved to areas outside the home (p < 0.000). There was a significant change in injury type, final disposition and device-associated injury (p < 0.05). Wheeled recreational devices were associated with over 20% of all injuries by reopening phase 1. CONCLUSIONS: This study reveals that total attendances and total injuries reduced during initial phases of the lockdown. This was followed by a significant increase in injury presentations, which reached a peak of 44.6% of all attendances. We identified potential modifiable characteristics of paediatric trauma which can be addressed by future public health strategies.","Gilmartin, Stephen; Barrett, Michael; Bennett, Michael; Begley, Cliona; Chroinin, Chantelle Ni; O’Toole, Patrick; Blackburn, Carol",Ir J Med Sci,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11845-021-02593-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33743160/,402

Students are reported to have greater psychological impacts from COVID-19. This study aimed to survey international students to better understand their traumatic effects and psychological reactions from COVID-19, to develop evidence-driven strategies to reduce adverse psychological impact during the pandemic. Method: We conducted an online survey that collected information on the demographics, economic conditions, academic conditions, and health statuses of native Chinese students attending university in the U.S. Psychological impact was assessed by the Post-traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) Checklist Civilian Version (PCL-C) and mental health status was assessed by the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale. Results: This study included 261 Chinese international students. In total, 37.5% of respondents’ PTSD PCL-C scores measured as moderate or severe. International students who were currently in China facing job-hunting or planning to continue studying abroad, severe economic pressure, and poor self-rated health status were significantly associated with greater PTSD PCL-C scores and higher levels of stress, anxiety, and depression. Conclusion: During the COVID-19 pandemic, more than one-third of the respondents rated their PTSD PCL-C score as moderate-to-severe and nearly half of them reported moderate-to-severe anxiety. Our findings identify factors such as future academic plan, economic pressure, and health status are associated with higher levels of psychological impact and worse mental health status. These should receive attention and psychological interventions should be implemented to improve the mental health of international students during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Song, Bijia; Zhao, Yilin; Zhu, Junchao",J Epidemiol Glob Health,https://doi.org/10.2991/jegh.k.201016.001; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33605116/,402

Design: Retrospective cohort study Participants and setting: Staff working at a single tertiary referral hospital who returned a positive test result for SARS-CoV-2 between 25 January 2020 and 25 November 2020. Main outcome measures: Source of COVID-19 infection. Results: Of 45 staff who returned a positive test result for SARS-CoV-2, 19 were determined to be acquired at Austin Health. Fifteen (15/19; 79% [95% CI: 54-94%]) of these were identified through contact tracing and testing following exposures to other infected staff and were presumed to be staff-staff transmission, including 10 healthcare workers (HCWs) linked to a single ward that cared for COVID-19 patients. Investigation of the outbreak identified the staff tearoom as the likely location for transmission, with subsequent reduction in HCW infections and resolution of the outbreak following implementation of enhanced control measures in tearoom facilities. No HCW contacts (0/204; 0% [95% CI: 0-2%]) developed COVID-19 infection following exposure to unrecognised patients with COVID-19. Conclusions: Unrecognised infections among staff may be a significant driver of HCW infections in healthcare settings.

Here, we present evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection of pancreatic beta cells in vivo using a robust and reproducible non-human primates model of mild to moderate COVID19 pathogenesis. Pancreas from SARS-CoV-2 infected subjects were positive for the SARS-CoV2 spike protein by immunohistochemistry and structures indicative of viral replication were evident by electron microscopy. Total beta cell area was decreased in SARS-CoV-2-infected pancreas, attributable to beta cell atrophy. Beta cell granularity was decreased. These histologic phenotypes persisted beyond the duration of the clinical disease course. Detailed electron microscopy of SARS-CoV-2 infected beta-cells revealed ultrastructural hallmarks of beta cell stress that are seen in islets of patients with Type 2 diabetes, including disrupted mitochondria and dilated endoplasmic reticulum. To assess the metabolic status of beta cells from SARS-CoV-2-infected subjects, we used fluorescence life-time imaging to measure the ratio of free and bound NADH as a surrogate of glycolytic and oxidative metabolism. We report an increase in free NADH levels, suggesting that beta cells from SARS-CoV-2-infected subjects adopt a more glycolytic metabolic profile. Taken together, we conclude that SARS-CoV-2 infection induces beta cell stress that may compromise beta-cell function beyond the duration of the disease course. This raises the possibility that the beta cell stress and injury may have clinical implications of the long-term future health of patients that have recovered from COVID19.","Millette, Katelyn; Cuala, Janielle; Wang, Peiyu; Marks, Carolyn; Woo, Veronica; Hayun, Maya; Kang, Harsimar; Martin, Martin; Dhawan, Sangeeta; Chao, Lily; Fraser, Scott; Junge, Jason; Lewis, Mark; Georgia, Senta",Res Sq,https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-592374/v1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34312617/,402

This note challenges this status on conceptual terms. First, we investigate its academic foundations and contend that it fails to portray the complexities of choice, agency, and causality in climate-induced mobility. We then parallel this concept with narratives on traditional asylum seekers to argue that, in a context of heightened anti-immigration sentiment, using security and victim frames may be counterproductive. Finally, we contend that the concept of “climate refugees” is difficult to institutionalize at the international level because it would require challenging dominant conceptions of humanitarian and environmental distress and call into question the West’s responsibility in global climate change and inequality. We conclude that promoting more humane and effective governance regimes requires integrating affected communities’ perspective and conceptualizing climate-induced mobilities as complex and multifactorial processes.

Here, we have designed and developed toehold RNA-based sensors for direct and ultrasensitive SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection. In our assay, isothermal amplification of a fragment of SARS-CoV-2 RNA coupled with activation of our biosensors leads to a conformational switch in the sensor. This leads to translation of a reporter-protein e.g. LacZ or Nano-lantern that is easily detected using color/luminescence. This response can be visualized by the human eye, or a simple cell phone camera as well as quantified using a spectrophotometer/luminometer. By optimizing RNA-amplification and biosensor-design, we have generated a highly-sensitive diagnostic assay; with sensitivity down to attomolar (100 copies of) SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Finally, the biosensor efficiently detects the presence of viral RNA in human patient samples, with clear distinction from samples designated negative for the virus. The biosensor response correlates well with Ct values from RT-qPCR tests and thus presents a powerful and easily accessible strategy for detecting Covid infection.","Chakravarthy, A.; N, A.

Both ACE and ACE2 are membrane‐bound ectoenzymes and may circulate in plasma as a consequence of a proteolytic shedding event. In this study, we show that ACE2 circulates in human plasma, but its activity is suppressed by the presence of an endogenous inhibitor. Partial purification of this inhibitor indicated that the inhibitor is small, hydrophilic and cationic, but not a divalent metal cation. These observations led us to develop a method for removal of the inhibitor, thus allowing detection of plasma ACE2 levels using a sensitive quenched fluorescent substrate‐based assay. Using this technique, ACE2 activity measured in plasma from healthy volunteers (n= 18) ranged from 1.31 to 8.69 pmol substrate cleaved min(−1) ml(−1) (mean ±s.e.m., 4.44 ± 0.56 pmol min(−1) ml(−1)). Future studies of patients with cardiovascular, renal and liver disease will determine whether plasma ACE2 is elevated in parallel with increased tissue levels observed in these conditions.","Lew, Rebecca A.; Warner, Fiona J.; Hanchapola, Iresha; Yarski, Michael A.; Manohar, Jay; Burrell, Louise M.; Smith, A.

Currently, little is known about how these structurally similar filaments recognize and distinguish one another. A cryo-EM structure of the AIM2(PYD) filament reveals that the architecture of the upstream filament is essentially identical to that of the adaptor ASC(PYD) filament. In silico simulations using Rosetta and molecular dynamics followed by biochemical and cellular experiments consistently demonstrate that individual filaments assemble bidirectionally. By contrast, the recognition between AIM2 and ASC requires at least one to be oligomeric and occurs in a head-to-tail manner. Using in silico mutagenesis as a guide, we also identify specific axial and lateral interfaces that dictate the recognition and distinction between AIM2 and ASC filaments. Together, the results here provide a robust framework for delineating the signaling specificity and order of inflammasomes.","Matyszewski, Mariusz; Zheng, Weili; Lueck, Jacob; Mazanek, Zachary; Mohideen, Naveen; Lau, Albert Y.; Egelman, Edward H.; Sohn, Jungsan",Nat Commun,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-021-23045-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33980849/,402

These “Crafty” teaching modules can be paired with virtual instruction and/or data collected by an instructor to replicate traditional microbiology lab exercises that characterize an unknown microbe. Materials and procedures used were carefully chosen to best mimic the texture of media, represent microbial diversity, assess aseptic technique, and produce analyzable data from results. Some protocols build upon and extend previously unpublished ideas, while others provide novel methods. The lab skills include proper personal protective equipment usage and basic biosafety, aseptic technique, microscopy and staining, streaking for isolation, spread plating, serial dilutions, filtering, disk diffusion method, and modeling an epidemic. Each protocol includes a student handout with background, links to videos of the methods performed with microbes, a rationale for the pairing of craft and consumable lab supplies along with technique used, a video or image demonstration of the “Crafty” technique when needed, postlab questions, and an instructor guide. This resource was developed for an undergraduate microbiology course, and each lab is aligned with learning outcomes within the American Society for Microbiology’s undergraduate curriculum guidelines. This work would also be useful for outreach and K–12 educators. The development of microbiology lab skills by all students, regardless of economic or health status, will lead to a more scientifically minded society.","Estes, Anne M.; Jozwick, Anna S.; Kerr, Jennifer E.",J Microbiol Biol Educ,https://doi.org/10.1128/jmbe.v22i1.2345; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33884089/,402

Fluoroquinolones, represented by levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin, are widely used for treatment of UTIs. However, it remains controversial for the comparison between the 2 drugs, which propelled us to conduct the first evidence-based research on this topic. To establish their relative efficacy and safety, we searched Pubmed, embase, and Web of Science for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) for UTIs. A total of 5 RCTs were finally included, involving 2,352 patients and a systematic review and meta-analysis were performed to compare the end-of-therapy and posttherapy clinical success rate, microbial eradication rate and adverse event rate. Jadad score and Review Manager 5.3.0 version were applied respectively to evaluate the study quality and heterogeneity. There was no significant difference between levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin group in end-of-therapy or posttherapy clinical success rate and microbial eradication rate (p > 0.05). As for adverse event rate, the 2 drugs were comparable and both safe for clinical use. Based on one included trial and pharmacological research, we raised hypothesis that levofloxacin was superior to ciprofloxacin for treatment of E. coli-induced chronic bacterial prostatitis (CBP) and it required a further study to prove it.","Cao, Dehong; Shen, Yinzhi; Huang, Yin; Chen, Bo; Chen, Zeyu; Ai, Jianzhong; Liu, Liangren; Yang, Lu; Wei, Qiang",Front Pharmacol,https://doi.org/10.3389/fphar.2021.658095; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33897441/,402

665684,Clinical features of patients who had two COVID‐19 episodes: a European multicentre case series,2021-03-10,"BACKGROUND: Burnout is a syndrome resulting from chronic workplace stress that has not been successfully managed. Healthcare professionals are particularly susceptible to this occupational phenomenon. There is limited literature currently published addressing burnout in the context of the Irish frontline workers during the COVID-19 pandemic. OBJECTIVES: Our study aims to determine the rate and degree of burnout present in the emergency department (ED) staff at St. James hospital Dublin (SJH) and at Cork University Hospital (CUH), in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. DESIGN: A cross-sectional study was performed on a convenience sample of medical staff and healthcare staff in the ED at Cork University Hospital and St. James Hospital Dublin, two major University Hospital EDs. Burnout was measured using the Oldenburg burnout inventory (OLBI) a standardised 16-question instrument. Participants also provided demographic data and answered several questions relating to the pandemic. PARTICIPANTS: Ninety-nine participants across two departments responded (a response rate of 30%). All ED cohorts were represented. RESULTS: Burnout was identified in almost three quarters of respondents (74%). The mean burnout scores were 2.42 (OLBI cut-off 2.18). There was mean disengagement level of 2.25 and a mean exhaustion level of 2.59. There was no statistically significant variance between staff, by demographics (i.e. occupation, years working in the ED, age, or gender). There was no significant difference in burnout rates or scores between St. James Hospital, Dublin, and Cork University Hospital, though the former tended to have a higher rate of burnout at 81% vs the 67% burnout observed in CUH. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic may be contributing to the long-established problem of health care burnout. The trajectory of this disease is still unclear. Consistent, progressive measures to address staff well-being, and support frontline workers, are imperative going forward.","Sheehan, Oisín; Sheehan, Micheal; Rau, Raluca Ileana; Sullivan, Iomhar O.; McMahon, Geraldine; Payne, Ann",Ir J Med Sci,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11845-021-02795-w; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34628589/,402

To identify characteristics of workers and industries where particular concerns are more common. Method Prospective cohort study of 1063 employed Australian adults, enrolled at the start of the pandemic. Data on attitudes to workplaces reopening were collected 1 July–30 September 2020. The frequency of concerns describes infection risk and changes to work and impact on home life. Regression models examined associations between demographic and industry factors with reopening concerns. Results More than four in five (82.4%) of workers reported concerns about workplace infection risk. Just over half (53.4%) reported concerns about impacts to work and home life. Concerns were more prevalent for workers reporting psychological distress, financial stress, and among those exclusively working from home. Concerns regarding infection risk were common for workers in health care (IRR 1.16, 95% CI [1.01, 1.33]), retail (IRR 1.31, 95% CI [1.06, 1.61]), and accommodation/food service industries (IRR 1.25, 95% CI [1.01, 1.55]). Concerns regarding changes to work and home life were more common for female workers (IRR 1.24, 95% CI [1.07, 1.43]), and partners/spouses with dependent children (IRR 1.44, 95% CI [1.16, 1.79]). Conclusion Concerns of COVID-19 infection in the workplace are common. Many workers are also concerned about changes to their work and home life. The prevalence of concerns is related to the nature of work and responsibilities at home. Actions that reduce risk of workplace transmission, coupled with effective communication of infection controls, may alleviate worker concerns whilst recognising workers’ family and social circumstances.

In the present study, we have identified a third population of memory CD4 T cells characterized as CD45RA(+)CCR7(–) that, based on its replication history and the homeostatic proliferative capacity, was at an advanced stage of differentiation. Three different phenotypic patterns of memory CD4 T cell responses were delineated under different conditions of antigen (Ag) persistence and load using CD45RA and CCR7 as markers of memory T cells. Mono‐phenotypic CD45RA(–)CCR7(+) or CD45RA(–)CCR7(–) CD4 T cell responses were associated with conditions of Ag clearance (tetanus toxoid‐specific CD4 T cell response) or Ag persistence and high load (chronic HIV‐1 and primary CMV infections), respectively. Multi‐phenotypic CD45RA(–)CCR7(+), CD45RA(–)CCR7(–) and CD45RA(+)CCR7(–) CD4 T cell responses were associated with protracted Ag exposure and low load (chronic CMV, EBV and HSV infections and HIV‐1 infection in long‐term nonprogressors). The mono‐phenotypic CD45RA(–)CCR7(+) response was typical of central memory (T(CM)) IL‐2‐secreting CD4 T cells, the mono‐phenotypic CD45RA(–)CCR7(–) response of effector memory (T(EM)) IFN‐γ‐secreting CD4 T cells and the multi‐phenotypic response of both IL‐2‐ and IFN‐γ‐secreting cells. The present results indicate that the heterogeneity of different Ag‐specific CD4 T cell responses is regulated by Ag exposure and Ag load.","Harari, Alexandre; Vallelian, Florence; Pantaleo, Giuseppe",Eur J Immunol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15484193/,402
667144,Response of the authors regarding article “Electrocardiographic markers of increased risk of sudden cardiac death in patients with COVID‐19 pneumonia”,2021-07-21,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a highly infectious type of pneumonia caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) that has rapidly become a global pandemic. COVID-19, SARS and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) are all caused by members of the Coronaviridae family. As expected, emerging genetic and clinical evidence from patients with COVID-19 has indicated that the pathway of infection is similar to that of SARS and MERS. Additionally, much like SARS and MERS, chest imaging serves an important role in the diagnosis, management and follow-up of patients with COVID-19. Although these related viruses present a similar pneumonic pathogenesis, the imaging results have distinguishable features. The current review evaluated the imaging results of patients with SARS and MERS and explored the potential similarities and differences among patients with COVID-19, SARS and MERS at early, progressive, severe and recovery stages, with the aim of improving our understanding of SARS-CoV-2 infections by comparing the features of COVID-19 images with those of SARS and MERS. The current review assessed whether imaging results had implications for the administration of corticosteroids as treatment for COVID-19. Whether corticosteroids can inhibit inflammatory cytokine storms and reduce the mortality of patients with viral pneumonia remains controversial. However, his review may help radiologists and clinicians to identify viral pneumonia and guide appropriate COVID-19 treatment.","Chen, Yuanbin; Guo, Liya; Jiao, Yiqing; Fan, Feiting; Liu, Jian; Chen, Ming; Yuan, Huaiping; Lin, Lin; Wang, Yuguang",Exp Ther Med,https://doi.org/10.3892/etm.2021.9787; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33732329/,402

Neutralization testing showed that ck/CH/LZJ/111113 was distinct from either the Chinese predominant IBV LX4-type or Mass-type vaccine strains. Phylogenetic analysis confirmed that ck/CH/LZJ/111113 is of the 4/91 type; however, further extensive analyses of full-length genomes identified occurrence of recombination events. Therefore, ck/CH/LZJ/111113 originated from the recombination events between ck/CH/LDL/091022- and 4/91-like strains at three switch sites located upstream of the spike (S) glycoprotein gene, and the 3′ ends of S1 and nuceocapsid (N) genes, respectively. The difference of serotypes and tissue tropisms in kidneys between ck/CH/LZJ/111113 and ck/CH/LDL/091022 may have been contributed by the uptake of the S1 gene by a ck/CH/LDL/091022-like virus from a 4/91-like strain. This recombination event took place at the 3′ end of the N gene and the 3′ untranslated region may account for differences in replication efficiency in tissues of chickens inoculated by the two viruses.","Liu, Xiaoli; Ma, Huijie; Xu, Qianqian; Sun, Nana; Han, Zongxi; Sun, Chuyang; Guo, Hongbo; Shao, Yuhao; Kong, Xiangang; Liu, Shengwang",Vet Microbiol,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378113512005664; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23182435/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vetmic.2012.10.027; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0378113512005664,402

METHODS AND RESULTS: Using nationwide Danish registries, we included all patients, aged 18–90 years, receiving a new-onset AF diagnosis during the first 3 months of 2019 and 2020. The main comparison was between patients diagnosed during lockdown (12 March 12–1 April 2020) and patients diagnosed in the corresponding period 1 year previously. We found a lower incidence of new-onset AF during the 3 weeks of lockdown compared with the corresponding weeks in 2019 [incidence rate ratios with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the 3 weeks: 0.66 (0.56–0.78), 0.53 (0.45–0.64), and 0.41 (0.34–0.50)]. There was a 47% drop in total numbers (562 vs. 1053). Patients diagnosed during lockdown were younger and with a lower CHA(2)DS(2)-VASc score, while history of cancer, heart failure, and vascular disease were more prevalent. During lockdown, 30 (5.3%) patients with new-onset AF suffered an ischaemic stroke and 15 (2.7%) died, compared with 45 (4.3%) and 14 (1.3%) patients during the corresponding 2019 period, respectively. The adjusted odds ratio of a related event (ischaemic stroke or all-cause death) during lock-down compared with the corresponding weeks was 1.41 (95% CI 0.93–2.12). CONCLUSIONS: Following a national lockdown in Denmark, a 47% drop in registered new-onset AF cases was observed. In the event of prolonged or subsequent lockdowns, the risk of undiagnosed AF patients developing complications could potentially translate into poorer outcomes in patients with AF during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Holt, Anders; Gislason, Gunnar H; Schou, Morten; Zareini, Bochra; Biering-Sørensen, Tor; Phelps, Matthew; Kragholm, Kristian; Andersson, Charlotte; Fosbøl, Emil L; Hansen, Morten Lock; Gerds, Thomas A; Køber, Lars; Torp-Pedersen, Christian; Lamberts, Morten",Eur Heart J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32578859/; https://doi.org/10.1093/eurheartj/ehaa494,402

Aim of this study was exploring the relationship between disability, coping strategies, daily life reorganization and neuropsychiatric symptoms in an Italian MS population during the COVID‐19 lockdown, in order to identify potentially modifiable factors that could inform clinical management of mental distress in people with MS. METHODS: We explored the relationship between mental distress, disability and coping strategies in the Italian MS population under lockdown. Structural equation modeling was applied to information collected via web survey to identify modifiable factors that could account for mental distress. RESULTS: A total of 845 participants (497 with MS and 348 controls) were included in the study. The MS group had higher scores than the control group for depression (P = 0.005), but not for anxiety, emotional dyscontrol or sleep disturbances. The structural equation modeling explained 74% of the variance observed in depression score. Within the model, three latent factors were characterized from measured variables: motor disability and cognitive dysfunction contributed to disability (β = 0.509 and β = 0.836; P < 0.001); positive attitude and exercise contributed to active attitude (β = 0.386 and β = 0.297; P < 0.001); and avoidance, social support and watching television contributed to passive attitude (β = 0.301, β = 0.243 and β = 0.212; P < 0.001). With regard to the relationship between latent factors and their influence on depression, disability contributed to passive attitude (β = 0.855; P < 0.001), while both passive and active attitude significantly influenced depression (β = 0.729 and β = −0.456; P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: As a practical implication of our model, favoring exercise would enhance active attitude and its positive impact on mental well‐being while, at the same time, reducing the negative impact of disability on depression, representing a valuable tool in facing COVID‐19‐related mental distress.","Costabile, T.; Carotenuto, A.; Lavorgna, L.; Borriello, G.; Moiola, L.; Inglese, M.; Petruzzo, M.; Trojsi, F.; Ianniello, A.; Nozzolillo, A.; Cellerino, M.; Boffa, G.; Rosa, L.; Servillo, G.; Moccia, M.; Bonavita, S.; Filippi, M.; Lanzillo, R.; Brescia Morra, V.; Petracca, M.",Eur J Neurol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33043560/; https://doi.org/10.1111/ene.14580,402

We aim to investigate the dynamic changes of immune status in COVID-19 patients with clinical evolution. METHODS: Sixty-one COVID-19 patients (42 mild cases and 19 severe cases, 51 cases without secondary infection as non-infection group and 10 cases with secondary bacterial/fungal infection as infection group) and 52 healthy controls (HCs) were enrolled from our hospital. Leucocyte classification, lymphocyte subsets and cytokines were detected by full-automatic blood cell analyzer and flow cytometer, respectively. RESULTS: Upon admission, eosinophils and lymphocyte subsets decreased significantly, while neutrophils, monocytes, basophils, IL-2, IL-6, IL-10 and IFN-γ increased significantly in COVID-19 patients compared to HCs. CD3(+) T and DN (CD3(+)CD4(-)CD8(-)) cells appeared sustained decline, leucocytes, neutrophils and IL-10 showed sustained increase in severe group compared to mild group. Compared with the non-infection group, we observed a depletion of eosinophils, CD3(+) T and CD4(+) T cells, but leucocytes, neutrophils, IL-6 and IL-10 on the contrary in the infection group. Besides, in severe group of COVID-19 patients, DN cells were negatively correlated with IL-10, and DP (CD3(+)CD4(+)CD8(+)) cells were negatively correlated with IL-6. Lymphocytes, eosinophils, CD3(+) T cells, CD4(+) T cells, IL-6 and IL-10 all had great diagnostic efficacy (AUC, 0.905-0.975) for COVID-19. The laboratory indicators of COVID-19 patients with improved condition also showed a recovery trend with time. CONCLUSIONS: The immune status of COVID-19 patients is different in each stage, and dynamic monitoring of related indicators can help predict the disease and may avoid cytokine storms.","Guan, Jingjing; Wei, Xin; Qin, Shuang; Liu, Xiaoyuan; Jiang, Yujie; Chen, Yingxiao; Chen, Yanfan; Lu, Hong; Qian, Jingjing; Wang, Zhongyong; Lin, Xiangyang",Int Immunopharmacol,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.intimp.2020.107034; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33039966/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1567576920323535; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1567576920323535?v=s5,402

In this retrospective observational study, a total of 1025 Japanese medical students of Asahikawa Medical University underwent measurements of the cycloplegic refractive error and axial length (AL), from 2011 to 2020. The spherical equivalent (SE) and AL were correlated significantly with the fiscal year of births (p = 0.004 and p = 0.034, respectively) only during enforcement of the system of high-pressure education. The SE and AL regression rates during the two educational approaches differed significantly (p = 0.004 and p = 0.037, respectively). The prevalence of high myopia was correlated significantly (p < 0.001) only during the system of high-pressure education. The regression of the prevalence rate of high myopia during the two education approaches differed significantly (p = 0.010). The progression rates of myopia and increased prevalence of high myopia were observed only during high-pressure education, suggesting that not only ophthalmologists but also educators and the government should work on together to control the progression of myopia.","Ishiko, Satoshi; Kagokawa, Hiroyuki; Nishikawa, Noriko; Song, Youngseok; Sugawara, Kazuhiro; Nakagawa, Hiroaki; Kawamura, Yuichiro; Yoshida, Akitoshi",J Clin Med,https://doi.org/10.3390/jcm10184229; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34575338/,402

Treatments using natural-product nanomaterials are a promising technique because of their relatively low toxicity compared to inorganic nanomaterials such as silver nanoparticles or carbon nanotubes. In this study, antimicrobial filters were fabricated from natural Euscaphis japonica nanoparticles, which were produced by nebulizing E. japonica extract. The coated filters were assessed in terms of pressure drop, antimicrobial activity, filtration efficiency, major chemical components, and cytotoxicity. Pressure drop and antimicrobial activity increased as a function of nanoparticle deposition time (590, 855, and 1150 µg/cm2(filter) at 3-, 6-, and 9-min depositions, respectively). In filter tests, the antimicrobial efficacy was greater against Staphylococcus epidermidis than Micrococcus luteus; ~61, ~73, and ~82% of M. luteus cells were inactivated on filters that had been coated for 3, 6, and 9 min, respectively, while the corresponding values were ~78, ~88, and ~94% with S. epidermidis. Although statistically significant differences in filtration performance were not observed between samples as a function of deposition time, the average filtration efficacy was slightly higher for S. epidermidis aerosols (~97%) than for M. luteus aerosols (~95%). High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry (ESI/MS) analyses confirmed that the major chemical compounds in the E. japonica extract were 1(ß)-O-galloyl pedunculagin, quercetin-3-O-glucuronide, and kaempferol-3-O-glucoside. In vitro cytotoxicity and disk diffusion tests showed that E. japonica nanoparticles were less toxic and exhibited stronger antimicrobial activity toward some bacterial strains than a reference soluble nickel compound, which is classified as a human carcinogen. This study provides valuable information for the development of a bioaerosol control system that is environmental friendly and suitable for use in indoor environments.","Hwang, Gi Byoung; Heo, Ki Joon; Yun, Ji Ho; Lee, Jung Eun; Lee, Hee Ju; Nho, Chu Won; Bae, Gwi- Nam; Jung, Jae Hee",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25974109/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0126481,402

These proteins are dispensable for viral replication in vitro but are supposed to play a role in virulence. In the current study, we produced and characterized 7b-specific monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). A recombinant form of the 7b protein was expressed as a fusion protein in Escherichia coli, purified by immobilized metal affinity chromatography and used as immunogen. Two hybridoma lines, 5B6 and 14D8, were isolated that expressed mAbs that recognized 7b proteins of both FCoV serotypes. Using an extensive set of N- and C-terminally truncated 7b proteins expressed in E. coli and a synthetic peptide, the binding sites of mAbs 5B6 and 14D8 were mapped to an 18-residue region that comprises the only potential N-glycosylation site of the FCoV 7b protein. The two mAbs were suitable to detect a 24-kDa protein, which represents the nonglycosylated form of 7b in FCoV-infected cells. We speculate that glycosylation of 7b is part of the viral evasion strategy to prevent an immune response against this antigenic site.","Lemmermeyer, Tanja; Lamp, Benjamin; Schneider, Rainer; Ziebuhr, John; Tekes, Gergely; Thiel, Heinz-Jürgen",Vet Microbiol,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0378113515301140; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378113515301140; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vetmic.2015.12.009; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26854339/,402

672176,Intensity of anticoagulation and survival in patients hospitalized with COVID-19 pneumonia,2020-09-23,"BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVES: The COVID-19 pandemic emerged as a major public health emergency affecting the healthcare services all over the world. It is essential to analyze the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of patients with COVID-19 in different parts of our country. This study highlights clinical experience in managing patients with COVID-19 at a tertiary care centre in northern India. METHODS: Clinical characteristics and outcomes of consecutive adults patients admitted to a tertiary care hospital at Chandigarh, India, from April 1 to May 25, 2020 were studied. The diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection was confirmed by real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) on throat and/or nasopharyngeal swabs. All patients were managed according to the institute's consensus protocol and in accordance with Indian Council of Medical Research guidelines. RESULTS: During the study period, 114 patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection were admitted. The history of contact with COVID-19-affected individuals was available in 75 (65.8%) patients. The median age of the patients was 33.5 yr (13-79 yr), and there were 66 (58%) males. Of the total enrolled patients, 48 (42%) were symptomatic. The common presenting complaints were fever (37, 77%), cough (26, 54%) and shortness of breath (10, 20.8%). Nineteen (17%) patients had hypoxia (SpO2<94%) at presentation and 36 (31%) had tachypnoea (RR >24). Thirty four (29.8%) patients had an accompanying comorbid illness. Age more than 60 yr and presence of diabetes and hypertension were significantly associated with severe COVID-19 disease. Admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) was needed in 18 patients (52%), with three (2.6%) patients requiring assisted ventilation. Mortality of 2.6 per cent (3 patients) was observed. INTERPRETATION & CONCLUSIONS: Majority of the patients with COVID-19 infection presenting to our hospital were young and asymptomatic. Fever was noted only in three-fourth of the patients and respiratory symptoms in half of them. Patients with comorbidities were more vulnerable to complications. Triaged classification of patients and protocol-based treatment resulted in good outcomes and low case fatality.","Soni, Shiv Lal; Kajal, Kamal; Yaddanapudi, L.N.; Malhotra, Pankaj; Puri, Goverdhan Dutt; Bhalla, Ashish; Singh, Mini P.; Sehgal, Inderpaul Singh; Koushal, Vipin; Varma, Neelam; Biswal, Manisha; Lakshmi, P.V.M.; Sharma, Sadhna; Suri, Vikas; Deepy, Z.; Ram, Sant; Yadav, Jaivinder; Pandey, Navin; Sharma, Prashant; Malik, Nabhajit; Goyal, Kapil; Mehra, Aseem; Sahoo, Swapnajeet; Mohindra, Ritin; Francis, Jijo; Bhargava, Mudit; Singla, Karan; Babu, Preena; Verma, Amiy; Khaire, Niranjan Shiwaji; Guru, R.R.",Indian J Med Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33818468/; https://doi.org/10.4103/ijmr.ijmr_2311_20,402

Cells are basic units of life with diverse functions in mature and developing organs, which biological properties could be utilized as a promising therapeutic approach for currently intractable and incurable diseases. Xenogeneic cell therapy utilizing animal cells other than human for medicinal purpose has been studied as a new way of treating diseases. Xenogeneic cell therapy is considered as a potential regenerative approach to fulfill current unmet medical needs because xenogeneic cells could be isolated from different animal organs and expanded ex vivo as well as maintain the characteristics of original organs, providing a versatile and plenty cell source for cell-based therapeutics beside autologous and allogeneic sources. The swine species is considered the most suitable source because of the similarity with humans in size and physiology of many organs in addition to the economic and ethical reasons plus the possibility of genetic modification. This review discusses the old proposed uses of xenogeneic cells such as xenogeneic pancreatic islet cells, hepatocytes and neuronal cells as a living drug for the treatment of degenerative and organ failure diseases. Novel applications of xenogeneic mesenchymal stroma cells and urothelial cells are also discussed. There are formidable immunological barriers toward successful cellular xenotransplantation in clinic despite major progress in the development of novel immunosuppression regimens and genetically multimodified donor pigs. However, immunological barriers could be turn into immune boosters by using xenogeneic cells of specific tissue types as a novel immunotherapeutic agent to elicit bystander antitumor immunity due to rejection immune responses. Xenogeneic cells have the potential to become a safe and efficacious option for intractable diseases and hard-to-treat cancers, adding a new class of cellular medicine in our drug armamentarium.","Huang, Chi-Ping; Yang, Chi-Yu; Shyr, Chih-Rong",Cell Transplant,https://doi.org/10.1177/09636897211011995; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33975464/,402

In a comprehensive meta-analysis of the empirical literature spanning six decades between 1960 and 2020, we observe channel performance is indeed negatively linked to channel conflict. However, we find that this conflict–performance link has evolved significantly over time, roughly in keeping with the growth and maturing of e-commerce technologies. Further, the damage caused by conflict appears to be more pronounced for channels with international operations, and for channels with greater dependency between channel members. Additionally, businesses in North America seem to suffer the consequences of channel conflict more than others. Our results also show several study characteristics related to measurement and sampling significantly impact the empirical conflict–performance links reported in the literature.

Elevation of D-dimer is a potential biomarker for poor prognosis in COVID-19, though optimal cutoff value for D-dimer to predict mortality has not yet been established. This study aims to assess the accuracy of admission D-dimer in the prognosis of COVID-19 and to establish the optimal cutoff D-dimer value to predict hospital mortality. METHODS: Clinical and laboratory parameters and outcomes of confirmed COVID-19 cases admitted to four hospitals in Kathmandu were retrospectively analyzed. Admitted COVID-19 cases with recorded D-dimer and definitive outcomes were included consecutively. D-dimer was measured using immunofluorescence assay and reported in Fibrinogen Equivalent Unit (μg/ml). The receiver operating characteristic curve was used to determine the accuracy of D-dimer in predicting mortality, and to calculate the optimal cutoff value, based on which patients were divided into two groups and predictive value of D-dimer for mortality was measured. RESULTS: 182 patients were included in the study out of which 34(18.7%) died during the hospital stay. The mean admission D-dimer among surviving patients was 1.067 μg/ml (±1.705 μg/ml), whereas that among patients who died was 3.208 μg/ml (±2.613 μg/ml). ROC curve for D-dimer and mortality gave an area under the curve of 0.807 (95% CI 0.728–0.886, p<0.001). Optimal cutoff value for D-dimer was 1.5 μg/ml (sensitivity 70.6%, specificity 78.4%). On Cox proportional hazards regression analysis, the unadjusted hazard ratio for high D-dimer was 6.809 (95% CI 3.249–14.268, p<0.001), and 5.862 (95% CI 2.751–12.489, p<0.001) when adjusted for age. CONCLUSION: D-dimer value on admission is an accurate biomarker for predicting mortality in patients with COVID-19. 1.5 μg/ml is the optimal cutoff value of admission D-dimer for predicting mortality in COVID-19 patients.","Poudel, Ayusha; Poudel, Yashasa; Adhikari, Anurag; Aryal, Barun Babu; Dangol, Debika; Bajracharya, Tamanna; Maharjan, Anil; Gautam, Rakshya",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34437642/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0256744,402
673736,Automated AI-Driven CT Quantification of Lung Disease Predicts Adverse Outcomes in Patients Hospitalized for COVID-19 Pneumonia,2021-05-14,"Since the mid-19(th) century, human activities have increased greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide in the Earth's atmosphere that resulted in increased average temperature. The effects of rising temperature include soil degradation, loss of productivity of agricultural land, desertification, loss of biodiversity, degradation of ecosystems, reduced fresh-water resources, acidification of the oceans, and the disruption and depletion of stratospheric ozone. All these have an impact on human health, causing non-communicable diseases such as injuries during natural disasters, malnutrition during famine, and increased mortality during heat waves due to complications in chronically ill patients. Direct exposure to natural disasters has also an impact on mental health and, although too complex to be quantified, a link has even been established between climate and civil violence. Over time, climate change can reduce agricultural resources through reduced availability of water, alterations and shrinking arable land, increased pollution, accumulation of toxic substances in the food chain, and creation of habitats suitable to the transmission of human and animal pathogens. People living in low-income countries are particularly vulnerable. Climate change scenarios include a change in distribution of infectious diseases with warming and changes in outbreaks associated with weather extreme events. After floods, increased cases of leptospirosis, campylobacter infections and cryptosporidiosis are reported. Global warming affects water heating, rising the transmission of water-borne pathogens. Pathogens transmitted by vectors are particularly sensitive to climate change because they spend a good part of their life cycle in a cold-blooded host invertebrate whose temperature is similar to the environment. A warmer climate presents more favorable conditions for the survival and the completion of the life cycle of the vector, going as far as to speed it up as in the case of mosquitoes. Diseases transmitted by mosquitoes include some of the most widespread worldwide illnesses such as malaria and viral diseases. Tick-borne diseases have increased in the past years in cold regions, because rising temperatures accelerate the cycle of development, the production of eggs, and the density and distribution of the tick population. The areas of presence of ticks and diseases that they can transmit have increased, both in terms of geographical extension than in altitude. In the next years the engagement of the health sector would be working to develop prevention and adaptation programs in order to reduce the costs and burden of climate change.","Rossati, Antonella",Int J Occup Environ Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28051192/; https://doi.org/10.15171/ijoem.2017.963,402

The p38 MAPK receptor is considered a plausible therapeutic target because of its involvement in the platelet activation processes leading to inflammation. This study aimed to identify potential natural product-derived inhibitory molecules against the p38α MAPK receptor to mitigate the eliciting of pro-inflammatory cytokines using computational techniques. The 3D X-ray structure of the receptor with PDB ID 3ZS5 was energy minimized using GROMACS and used for molecular docking via AutoDock Vina. The molecular docking was validated with an acceptable area under the curve (AUC) of 0.704, which was computed from the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. A compendium of 38,271 natural products originating from Africa and China together with eleven known p38 MAPK inhibitors were screened against the receptor. Four potential lead compounds ZINC1691180, ZINC5519433, ZINC4520996 and ZINC5733756 were identified. The compounds formed strong intermolecular bonds with critical residues Val38, Ala51, Lys53, Thr106, Leu108, Met109 and Phe169. Additionally, they exhibited appreciably low binding energies which were corroborated via molecular mechanics Poisson–Boltzmann surface area (MM-PBSA) calculations. The compounds were also predicted to have plausible pharmacological profiles with insignificant toxicity. The molecules were also predicted to be anti-inflammatory, kinase inhibitors, antiviral, platelet aggregation inhibitors, and immunosuppressive, with probable activity (Pa) greater than probable inactivity (Pi). ZINC5733756 is structurally similar to estradiol with a Tanimoto coefficient value of 0.73, which exhibits anti-inflammatory activity by targeting the activation of Nrf2. Similarly, ZINC1691180 has been reported to elicit anti-inflammatory activity in vitro.

Methods: Real-time polymerase chain reaction (rt-PCR)-confirmed COVID-19-patients undergoing CXR from March to April 2020 together with COVID-19 negative patients as control group were retrospectively included. Two independent readers assessed CXR and mlCXR images for presence, disease extent and type (consolidation vs. ground-glass opacities (GGOs) of COVID-19-pneumonia. Further, readers had to assign confidence levels to their diagnosis. CT obtained ≤ 36 h from acquisition of CXR served as standard of reference. Inter-reader agreement, sensitivity for detection and disease extent of COVID-19-pneumonia compared to CT was calculated. McNemar test was used to test for significant differences. Results: Sixty patients (21 females; median age 61 years, range 38–81 years) were included. Inter-reader agreement improved from good to excellent when mlCXR instead of CXR was used (k = 0.831 vs. k = 0.742). Sensitivity for pneumonia detection improved from 79.5% to 92.3%, however, on the cost of specificity 100% vs. 71.4% (p = 0.031). Overall, sensitivity for the detection of consolidation was higher than for GGO (37.5% vs. 70.4%; respectively). No differences could be found in disease extent estimation between mlCXR and CXR, even though the detection of GGO could be improved. Diagnostic confidence was better on mlCXR compared to CXR (p = 0.013).

METHODS: This case-control study was conducted in two hospitals in Alborz Province in Iran. All recruited cases in this study were symptomatic adults hospitalized as COVID-19 patients with compatible Computed tomographic (CT) scan findings and available rRT-PCR results. The patients were recruited in this study. The patients were categorized into positive and negative rRT-PCR groups and evaluated for symptoms, initial vital signs, comorbidity, clinical and laboratory findings. Finally, the results were assessed by SPSS software. RESULTS: Between March 5 to April 5, 2020, 164 symptomatic COVID-19 patients were studied. In total, there were 111 rRT-PCR positive (67.6%) and 53 rRT-PCR negative patients (32.4%).

In turn, the virus can never completely eliminate the host population, because evolutionarily such an event is a dead end for the virus as an obligate intracellular parasite. A certain existential balance exists in the virus-host relationship. Against this backdrop, viral epidemics and pandemics only become manifest and egregious to human beings when tens and hundreds of thousands of people die and the question emerges what caused the high mortality peaks on the death chart. The answer seems clear; the emerging strain of the virus is new to the host population, and new mutations of the virus and natural selection will lead to a survival of only genetically resistant individuals in a host population. The dangers inherent to a novel virus are due to new features generally inthe molecular structure of proteins, which enable the virus to infect the cells of the host organism more intensively, dramatically challenging host immunity, and thus be transmitted more readily in the host population. In this article, we will concentrate on the facts currently available about severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which has caused COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) pandemic and try to predict its development and consequences based on the virus-host relationship. In fact, only two scenarios will occur simultaneously in the very near future: people who are genetically resistant to the virus will get sick, recover, and develop immunity, while people who are sensitive to the virus will need drugs and vaccines, which will have to be researched and developed if they are to recover. If the pandemic does not stop, in a few decades it is anticipated that SARS-CoV-2 will become as safe as the four non-severe acute respiratory syndrome human coronaviruses (HCoV-NL63, HCoV-HKU1, HCoV-OC43, and HCoV-229E) currently circulating but causing low mortality in the human population.","Oberemok, Volodymyr V.; Laikova, Kateryna V.; Yurchenko, Kseniya A.; Fomochkina, Irina I.; Kubyshkin, Anatolii V.",Inflamm Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32350571/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s00011-020-01352-y,402

Indeed, standards of care continue to evolve as does how this clinical entity is defined and how patients are grouped and treated in clinical practice. In this narrative review we discuss current standards – treatments that have a solid evidence base and are well established as targets for usual care – and also evolving standards – treatments that have promise and may become widely adopted in the future. We focus on three broad domains of ventilatory management, ventilation adjuncts, and pharmacotherapy. Current standards for ventilatory management include limitation of tidal volume and airway pressure and standard approaches to setting PEEP, while evolving standards might focus on limitation of driving pressure or mechanical power, individual titration of PEEP, and monitoring efforts during spontaneous breathing. Current standards in ventilation adjuncts include prone positioning in moderate-severe ARDS and veno-venous extracorporeal life support after prone positioning in patients with severe hypoxemia or who are difficult to ventilate. Pharmacotherapy current standards include corticosteroids for patients with ARDS due to COVID-19 and employing a conservative fluid strategy for patients not in shock; evolving standards may include steroids for ARDS not related to COVID-19, or specific biological agents being tested in appropriate sub-phenotypes of ARDS. While much progress has been made, certainly significant work remains to be done and we look forward to these future developments.","Menk, Mario; Estenssoro, Elisa; Sahetya, Sarina K.; Neto, Ary Serpa; Sinha, Pratik; Slutsky, Arthur S.; Summers, Charlotte; Yoshida, Takeshi; Bein, Thomas; Ferguson, Niall D.",Intensive Care Med,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00134-020-06299-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33156382/,402

Three days before the start of the block week of the “Teamwork” module, the Federal Office of Public Health (FOPH) announced the ban on live interaction, which made it impossible to conduct five days of practice in the simulation centre of the University Hospital of Zurich. But how can the teaching of all the learning objectives necessary for medical training be guaranteed during an exceptional situation with constantly changing conditions? In the case of the BSc Human Medicine at ETH Zurich (ETHZ), the answer is: Hybrid teaching. The field report “COVID-19 as a chance for hybrid teaching concepts” outlines how ETHZ switched to hybrid teaching within a very short time and how hospital placements were combined with video conferences. The qualitative surveys conducted at the end of the semester and the weekly quantitative surveys of students from March to June indicate the importance of personal exchange despite the ban on contact and that interactivity is possible even without physical proximity. An example from the autumn semester will also be used to show which aspects have proved to be successful and can therefore be retained.","Weissmann, Yaël; Useini, Mirdita; Goldhahn, Jörg",GMS J Med Educ,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33659617/; https://doi.org/10.3205/zma001408,402
677154,The association of hypertension with the severity and mortality of COVID-19 patients: evidence based on adjusted effect estimates,2020-06-25,"BACKGROUND: The prevalence of abnormal cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) findings in recovered coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients is unclear. This study aimed to investigate the prevalence of abnormal CMR findings in recovered COVID-19 patients. METHODS: A systematic literature search was performed to identify studies that report the prevalence of abnormal CMR findings in recovered COVID-19 patients. The number of patients with abnormal CMR findings and diagnosis of myocarditis on CMR (based on the Lake Louise criteria) and each abnormal CMR parameter were extracted. Subgroup analyses were performed according to patient characteristics (athletes vs. non-athletes and normal vs. undetermined cardiac enzyme levels). The pooled prevalence and 95% confidence interval (CI) of each CMR finding were calculated. Study heterogeneity was assessed, and meta-regression analysis was performed to investigate factors associated with heterogeneity. RESULTS: In total, 890 patients from 16 studies were included in the analysis. The pooled prevalence of one or more abnormal CMR findings in recovered COVID-19 patients was 46.4% (95% CI 43.2%–49.7%). The pooled prevalence of myocarditis and late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) was 14.0% (95% CI 11.6%–16.8%) and 20.5% (95% CI 17.7%–23.6%), respectively. Further, heterogeneity was observed (I(2) > 50%, p < 0.1). In the subgroup analysis, the pooled prevalence of abnormal CMR findings and myocarditis was higher in non-athletes than in athletes (62.5% vs. 17.1% and 23.9% vs. 2.5%, respectively). Similarly, the pooled prevalence of abnormal CMR findings and LGE was higher in the undetermined than in the normal cardiac enzyme level subgroup (59.4% vs. 35.9% and 45.5% vs. 8.3%, respectively). Being an athlete was a significant independent factor related to heterogeneity in multivariate meta-regression analysis (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Nearly half of recovered COVID-19 patients exhibited one or more abnormal CMR findings. Athletes and patients with normal cardiac enzyme levels showed a lower prevalence of abnormal CMR findings than non-athletes and patients with undetermined cardiac enzyme levels.

677647,Reply to “Changes in energy drink consumption during the COVID-19 quarantine”,2021-07-10,"Introduction Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID19) has shown higher mortality in patients with comorbidities, including cancer. First reports from China, Italy, and US showed mortality comprised between 20% and 40% in this specific population. However, the number of patients in these studies was limited and the percentage of hematological patients was underrepresented. In our study, we present a prospective evaluation of patients affected by solid and liquid tumors who were affected by COVID19 from the same geographical area and time period. Survival outcomes, prognostic risk factors, and effects of oncological treatments received were analyzed. Methods WAll consecutive oncological patients with age > 18 years old affected by COVID19 (confirmed by pharyngeal PCR test) who were hospitalized in 5 tertiary oncological referral centers in the Catalonia region were included in the study. The recruitment period started from 13/03/2020 to 24/04/2020. Two-hundred thirty-one patients were recruited. Thirty-three percent had hematological malignancies and 67% had solid tumors. The median age was 65 years (range 58-75 years). Female patients were 41%. Twenty-six percent of patients were not considered candidates to intensive care treatments (tracheal intubation) due to their advanced oncological status. Of the hematological cohort, lymphoid malignancies represented 36% of the population, multiple myeloma 20%; acute leukemias 15%; chronic lymphoproliferative diseases 12% and other malignancies 17%. At the time of infection, 11% of patients were receiving steroids (more than 0.5mg/kg/24 hours >15 days), 4% were on active immunosuppressive therapy (calcineurin inhibitors, sirolimus or mycophenolate mofetil) and 5% had grade >3 neutropenia. Most importantly, 61% were on active oncological treatment, 18% were on follow-up, 10% had been diagnosed without having received any treatment. Results At COVID19 diagnosis, 75% of patients had a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) < 24% and 63% had fever. Only 16% had cough,16 % had mucous secretion and 12% had dyspnea. All the other symptoms (myalgia, diarrhea, anosmia, ageusia, fatigue, headache) had an incidence < 10%. Chest X-ray was abnormal in 60% of cases. Regarding in-hospital treatments, 85% received antibiotics, 76% hydroxychloroquine, 12% tocilizumab, 30% corticoids, 70% prophylactic anticoagulation and 55% oxygen support. The median duration of hospitalization was 9.00 days (range 5-16 days). WThe overall mortality rate was 26% with a non-significant difference between hematological (32%) and oncological (23%) patients (p-value = 0.23, figure 1). A significant difference was observed between patients who were candidates to intensive care treatments (21.5%) and not candidates (42.6%)(p-value = 0.0038, figure 1). The following risk factors were associated with decreased survival on multivariate analysis: having the oncological disease in progression (HR 3.33, 95%Confidence Interval (CI)= 1.73-6-41, p<0.001); use of steroids (>0.5mg/kg/24 hours) in the last 15 days (HR 3.76; 95%CI=1.69-8.40, p<0.001); age (continuous variable, HR 1.05, 95%CI= 1.01-1-08, p=0.005); grade 4 neutropenia. When considering COVID19 in-hospital treatments, only steroids were associated with a protective effect on survival (HR 0.51, 95%CI=0.27-0.94, p=0.032) while hydroxychloroquine and tocilizumab had no significant effect. Severe respiratory insufficiency (defined as use of >50% FiO2 as oxygen support) was present or developed in 46% of patients. On multivariate analysis, the following factors were associated with a higher risk of developing severe respiratory insufficiency: use of steroids (>0.5mg/kg/24 hours) in the last 15 days (HR 2.36; 95%CI=1.12-4.97, p=0.023); age (HR 1.05, 95%CI= 1.01-1-08, p=0.009) and dyspnea at diagnosis (HR 3.95; 95%CI=1.77-8.78, p=0.001). Conclusion WCOVID19 is associated to increased mortality in patients affected by solid and liquid tumors. Being a candidate for intensive care treatments could improve survival while having progressive disease, older age and grade >3 neutropenia were considered negative factors. Interestingly, the use of steroids was associated to reduced survival if received within 15 days before COVID19 diagnosis, while it has protective effect when used as part of COVID19 therapy.

677951,A Comparison of Clinical Characteristics and Outcomes in Elderly and Younger Patients with COVID-19,2020-07-28,"OBJECTIVE: We sought to examine co-design in 3 contrasting case studies of technology-supported change in health care and explain its role in influencing project success. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Longitudinal case studies of a seizure detection and reporting technology for epilepsy (Southern England, 2018-2019), a telehealth service for heart failure (7 UK sites, 2016-2018), and a remote video consultation service (Scotland-wide, 2019-2020). We carried out interviews with 158 participants and collected more than 200 pages of field notes from observations. Within- and cross-case analysis was informed by sociotechnical theory. RESULTS: In the epilepsy case, co-design prioritized patient-facing features and focused closely around a specific clinic, which led to challenges with sustainability and mainstreaming. In the heart failure case, patient-focused co-design produced an accessible and usable patient portal but resulted in variation in uptake between clinical sites. Successful scale-up of video consultations was explained by a co-design process involving not only the technical interface, but also careful reshaping of work practices. DISCUSSION: A shift is needed from co-designing with technology users to co-designing with patients as service users, and with healthcare staff as professionals. Good co-design needs to involve users, including those who engage with the technology-supported service bothdirectly and indirectly. It requires sensitivity to emergence and unpredictability in complex systems. Healthcare staff need to be supported to accommodate iterative change in the service. Adequate resourcing and infrastructures for systems-focused co-design are essential. CONCLUSIONS: If co-design focuses narrowly on the technology, opportunities will be missed to coevolve technologies alongside clinical practices and organizational routines.","Papoutsi, Chrysanthi; Wherton, Joseph; Shaw, Sara; Morrison, Clare; Greenhalgh, Trisha",J Am Med Inform Assoc,https://doi.org/10.1093/jamia/ocaa197; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33043359/,402
678001,Lupus anticoagulant and mortality in patients hospitalized for COVID-19,2020-11-07,"This review aims at briefly presenting a retrospect on the retroviral nucleocapsid protein (NC), from an unspecific nucleic acid binding protein (NABP) to an all-in-one viral protein with multiple key functions in the early and late phases of the retrovirus replication cycle, notably reverse transcription of the genomic RNA and viral DNA integration into the host genome, and selection of the genomic RNA together with the initial steps of virus morphogenesis. In this context we will discuss the notion that NC protein has a flexible conformation and is thus a member of the growing family of intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) where disorder may account, at least in part, for its function as a nucleic acid (NA) chaperone and possibly as a protein chaperone vis-à-vis the viral DNA polymerase during reverse transcription. Lastly, we will briefly review the development of new anti-retroviral/AIDS compounds targeting HIV-1 NC because it represents an ideal target due to its multiple roles in the early and late phases of virus replication and its high degree of conservation.","Darlix, Jean-Luc; de Rocquigny, Hugues; Mauffret, Olivier; Mély, Yves",Virus Res,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0168170214002159; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168170214002159; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virusres.2014.05.011; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24907482/,402

In this sense, it was emphasized that the accuracy rate of diagnosis (classification) can be improved via deep learning algorithms, by needing no hybrid-complex models, and a secure data processing can be achieved with a multi-authentication and Tangle based approach. In detail, heart sounds were classified with Autoencoder Neural Networks (AEN) and an the IoHT system was built for supporting doctors in real-time. For developing the diagnosis infrastructure by the AEN, PASCAL B-Training and Physiobank-PhysioNet A-Training heart sound datasets were used accordingly. For the PASCAL dataset, the AEN provided a diagnosis-classification performance with the accuracy of 100%, sensitivity of 100%, and the specificity of 100% whereas the rates were respectively 99.8%, 99.65%, and 99.13% for the PhysioNet dataset. It was seen that the findings by the developed AEN based solution were better than the alternative solutions from the literature. Additionally, usability of the whole IoHT system was found positive by the doctors, and according to the 479 real-case applications, the system was able to achieve accuracy rates of 96.03% for normal heart sounds, 91.91% for extrasystole, and 90.11% for murmur.

Delayed presentation for medical emergencies has been noted by the medical community. There has been limited reporting on the impact for the care for emergent surgical conditions. We sought to describe the effect of the global pandemic on the presentation and outcomes for the most common urgent general surgery disease process, acute appendicitis. METHODS: We performed a retrospective review of patients admitted to the United States Naval Hospital Okinawa during the COVID-19 pandemic, from January 2020 to May 2020 (COVID cohort), and compared them to a historical cohort (pre-COVID cohort) over the prior 2 years. Demographics, clinical presentation data, and interventions were collected. RESULTS: Of the 80 patients with appendicitis, 20% presented perforated. Most patients were male (71%), presented with 1 day of symptoms and had a length of stay of 1 to 2 days. Comparing groups, 13% of the pre-COVID group vs. 31% of the COVID cohort presented perforated (P = .04), with a symptom duration of 1.6 vs. 2.7 days before presentation (P = .075), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic and the global systematic response has impacted unrelated medical and surgical conditions. At our overseas military hospital with minimal disease burden, we observed a delay in presentation for acute appendicitis with a higher incidence of perforation. Patients should be empowered to continue to seek care for urgent and emergent medical and surgical conditions so that they are not harmed by fear of COVID-19 rather than by COVID-19 itself.","Wang, Andrew W; Prieto, James; Ikeda, Daniel S; Lewis, Paul R; Benzer, Emily M; Van Gent, Jan-Michael",Mil Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33275655/; https://doi.org/10.1093/milmed/usaa527,402

679344,Digestion-Specific Acupuncture Effect on Feeding Intolerance in Critically Ill Post-Operative Oral and Hypopharyngeal Cancer Patients: A Single-Blind Randomized Control Trial,2021-06-19,"The COVID-19 pandemic, caused by the virus SARS-CoV-2, has been a major public health emergency and has caused millions of deaths worldwide to date. Due to the novel nature of the virus, efforts across the world are underway to better understand the molecular pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 and how it interacts with host immune responses. One important branch of the innate immune response, the interferon system, triggers the expression of many effector mechanisms known to be powerful antagonists against many pathogenic viruses. One such interferon stimulated mechanism is the OAS-RNaseL pathway, which is known to trigger the degradation of viral RNA in infected host cells. Our study seeks to utilize publicly available transcriptomic data to analyze the host cell OAS-RNaseL pathway to SARS-CoV-2 infection. We hoped to gain an understanding of the importance of the pathway in controlling SARS-CoV-2 infection and whether or not the pathway could be exploited therapeutically. Our findings demonstrated that upregulation of OAS-RNaseL pathway genes in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection varies based on cell type and appeared to correlate with ACE2 receptor expression. Pathway responses to other viruses like SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV were found to parallel those to SARS-CoV-2, suggesting common response patterns by the pathway to these viruses. Overall, these results demonstrate that the OAS-RNaseL pathway could contribute to control of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Further studies on various mechanistic actions by the pathway would need to be conducted to fully understand its role in host defense and therapy.","Chakravarty, Nikhil; Edillor, Penelope A.; Huang, Andy P.; Torres, Giovanni A.; Usmani, Manal T.; Kadandale, Pavan",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.04.29.442063,402
679939,"Clinical characteristics of imported and second-generation COVID-19 cases outside Wuhan, China: A multicenter retrospective study",2020-04-23,"INTRODUCTION: In mid-February, the nationwide immunization plan for the prevention of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) started in Japan (at first primarily focused on health professionals) using an mRNA-based vaccine (Pfizer/BioNTech). During the phase-in period from February to March, attention was focused on post-vaccination anaphylaxis and anaphylactoid symptoms from the viewpoint of ensuring the safety of the vaccination program. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this report was to provide an update on the status of anaphylaxis and anaphylactoid symptoms occurring after vaccination for COVID-19, as reported under the Adverse Event Following Immunization (AEFI) reporting system in Japan. METHODS: The Pharmaceutical and Medical Devices Agency (PMDA) received AEFI reports from health professionals and manufacturers under the reporting system for AEFI after vaccination for COVID-19, which has been in operation since mid-February 2021. Reported AEFIs of anaphylaxis and anaphylactoid symptoms were assessed using the Brighton Collaboration Criteria to assess diagnostic certainty. RESULTS: 1-month since Japan started the vaccination program for COVID-19 in February 2021, 578,835 doses have been administered to health professionals, with the PMDA receiving 181 suspected event reports of anaphylaxis and anaphylactoid symptoms. In 171 of these 181 cases, women developed these symptoms. Among 181 cases evaluated according to the Brighton Collaboration Criteria, 47 cases (26%) were classified as level 1–3 (reporting rate: 8.1/100,000 doses). CONCLUSION: The results appear similar to reported AEFIs in foreign studies of coronavirus vaccine administration to health professionals, although the reporting rate was higher. Further work is needed to examine the causal relationship of anaphylaxis reactions to coronavirus vaccine administration.

679992,Outcomes of COVID-19 Among Hospitalized Patients With Non-dialysis CKD,2020-12-03,"Objective To describe how the ENT and Head and Neck departments of the HMM and HVC hospitals were managed during the COVID-19 state of alert and to analyse the results obtained to assess the usefulness of telephone consultations in our specialty. Material and methods From March 16, the ENT and Head and Neck departments of the HMM and HVC Hospitals began telephone consultations. Due to the disparity in the actions of the different department members, the decision was made to create a protocol to manage these consultations which started to be implemented March 23. Results During the study period, 1054 patients were attended in the consultations of both departments; 663 (62.9%) were first visits and 391 (37.10%) were successive visits. Twenty-one percent (229) of the consultations could be resolved by telephone, 10.82% (114) required face-to-face care, 57.40% (605) were indicated for an on-demand check-up depending on their disease course, and 10.05% (106) of the patients could not be reached by telephone. Discussion The state of alarm caused by COVID-19 has been a determining factor in how we undertake our care work. In the ENT and Head and Neck departments of the HMM and HVC Hospitals we decided to carry out consultations by telephone as an alternative to the traditional consultation. During this period, we have observed that up to 21.73% of the consultations could be dealt with by telephone. Conclusion The telephone consultation seems to be a very useful tool to attend our patients avoiding the risk of COVID-19 infection during the state of alarm. Furthermore, according to the data analysed and the different studies, it seems a good alternative to the traditional consultation in selected patients.","González, María del Rosario Gómez; Pérez, Francisco M.

A cross-sectional design was employed and data were collected by use of a one-off online survey (N = 392; 18–85 years; M(BMI) = 25.48; SD(BMI) = 5.05; 314 women). Exercise motives, PA, and mental health were measured by use of the Behavioural Regulations in Exercise Questionnaire-3, Brunel Lifestyle Physical Activity Questionnaire, and General Health Questionnaire-12, respectively. Participants were also asked to specify their average step count per day, if they used a mobile device for this purpose (n = 190). Analyses comprised hierarchical regressions and partial correlations. Results indicated that behavioural regulations were more strongly associated with planned PA pre-lockdown, compared to during lockdown. There were no differences observed in explained variance between pre- and during lockdown for unplanned PA and steps per day. Planned and unplanned PA were significant explanatory variables for mental health both pre- and during lockdown, but sedentary behaviour was not. Partial correlations, with BMI and age partialled out, showed that steps per day were not correlated with mental health either pre- or during lockdown. The range of variables used to explain planned and unplanned PA and mental health suggest that people's motives to exercise were tempered by lockdown. For those who routinely measured their steps per day, the step count was unrelated to their mental health scores both pre- and during lockdown. It appears that engagement in regular PA confers some minor benefits for mental health.","Bird, Jonathan M.; Karageorghis, Costas I.; Hamer, Mark",Psychol Sport Exerc,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1469029221000637; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psychsport.2021.101945; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34518758/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1469029221000637,402

It is possible that the common exposure history at a seafood market in Wuhan originated from the human-to-human transmission events within the market, and the early, strong emphasis that market exposure indicated animal-to-human transmission was potentially the result of observer bias. To support the hypothesis of zoonotic origin of 2019-nCoV stemming from the Huanan seafood market, the index case should have had exposure history related to the market and the virus should have been identified from animals sold at the market.

The foremost therapeutic classes include flavones, isoflavones, flavonols, flavanones, flavanols, proanthocyanidins, anthocyanidins, chalcones, and aurones. The chalcone or 1,3-diphenyl-2E-propene-1-one represents the class of natural products which are comprised of benzylideneacetophenone function; i.e. two aromatic moieties linked together by an α, ß-unsaturated carbonyl bridge comprising three-carbons. At present, chalcone is one of the privileged scaffolds that can be synthesized in the laboratory to derive different pharmacologically active compounds. This article is the continued form of the previously published work on anti-infective perspectives of chalcones (highlighted till 2015). The current work emphasizes on the discovery process of the chalcone in the period of 2016 to 2017 on malaria, trypanosomiasis, leishmaniasis, filaria, tuberculosis, netamodes, Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV), Tobacco Mosaic Virus (TMV), Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), and miscellaneous conditions.

681809,A drone-based networked system and methods for combating coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic,2020-09-03,"BACKGROUND: Microglia, the primary immune cells of the central nervous system, exerts multiple functions to mediate many neurological diseases. Upon any detection of invading pathogen products (e.g., TLR agonists) or host-released signaling factors (e.g., interferon/IFN), these cells undergo an activation process to release large numbers of inflammatory substances that participate in inflammation and homeostasis. The profound effects of inflammation associated with TLR7/8 agonist Resiquimod (R848) and type 1 interferon (e.g., IFN-α)-induced macrophage and dendritic cell activation on biological outcomes have long been recognized. However, the underlying mechanisms are not well defined in microglial cells. METHODS: The present study investigated the molecular signatures of microglia and identified genes that are uniquely or synergistically expressed in R848-, IFN-α- or R848 with IFN-α-treated primary microglial (PM) cells. We used RNA-sequencing, quantitative real-time PCR, and bioinformatics approaches to derive regulatory networks that control the transcriptional response of PM to R848, IFN-α and R848 with IFN-α. RESULTS: Our approach revealed that the inflammatory response in R848 with IFN-α-treated PM is faster and more intense than that in R848 or IFN-α-treated PM in terms of the number of differentially expressed genes and the magnitude of induction/repression. In particular, our integrative analysis enabled us to suggest the regulatory functions of TFs, which allowed the construction of a network model that explains how TLR7/8 and IFN-α-sensing pathways achieve specificity. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, the systematic approach presented herein could be important to the understanding microglial activation-mediated molecular signatures induced by inflammatory stimuli related to TLR7/8, IFN-α or co-signaling, and associated transcriptional machinery of microglial functions and neuroinflammatory mechanisms.

682025,Effectiveness of Pre-procedural Mouth Rinses in Reducing Aerosol Contamination During Periodontal Prophylaxis: A Systematic Review,2021-06-10,"BACKGROUND: To increase bed capacity and resources, hospitals have postponed elective surgeries, although the financial impact of this decision is unknown. We sought to report elective surgical case distribution, associated gross hospital revenue and regional hospital and intensive care unit (ICU) bed capacity as elective surgical cases are cancelled and then resumed under simulated trends of COVID-19 incidence. METHODS: A retrospective, cohort analysis was performed using insurance claims from 161 million enrollees from the MarketScan database from January 1, 2008 to December 31, 2017. COVID-19 cases were calculated using Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation models. Centers for Disease Control (CDC) reports on the number of hospitalized and intensive care patients by age estimated the number of cases seen in the ICU, the reduction in elective surgeries and the financial impact of this from historic claims data, using a denominator of all inpatient revenue and outpatient surgeries. RESULTS: Assuming 5% infection prevalence, cancelling all elective procedures decreases ICU overcapacity from 160 to 130%, but these elective surgical cases contribute 78% (IQR 74, 80) (1.1 trillion (T) US dollars) to inpatient hospital plus outpatient surgical gross revenue per year. Musculoskeletal, circulatory and digestive category elective surgical cases compose 33% ($447B) of total revenue. CONCLUSIONS: Procedures involving the musculoskeletal, cardiovascular and digestive system account for the largest loss of hospital gross revenue when elective surgery is postponed. As hospital bed capacity increases following the COVID-19 pandemic, restoring volume of these elective cases will help maintain revenue. In these estimates, adopting universal masking would help to avoid overcapacity in all states.","Tonna, Joseph E.; Hanson, Heidi A.; Cohan, Jessica N.; McCrum, Marta L.; Horns, Joshua J.; Brooke, Benjamin S.; Das, Rupam; Kelly, Brenna C.; Campbell, Alexander John; Hotaling, James",BMC Health Serv Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33272278/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12913-020-05975-z,402

In addition, gene sets from interacting COVID-19 virus-host proteins and differentially expressed genes when comparing infected to uninfected cells are being published at a fast rate. To organize this rapidly accumulating knowledge, we developed the COVID-19 Gene and Drug Set Library (https://amp.pharm.mssm.edu/covid19/), a collection of gene and drug sets related to COVID-19 research from multiple sources. The COVID-19 Gene and Drug Set Library is delivered as a web-based interface that enables users to view, download, analyze, visualize, and contribute gene and drug sets related to COVID-19 research. To evaluate the content of the library, we performed several analyses including comparing the results from 6 in-vitro drug screens for COVID-19 repurposing candidates. Surprisingly, we observe little overlap across these initial screens. The most common and unique hit across these screen is mefloquine, a malaria drug that should receive more attention as a potential therapeutic for COVID-19.

AIMS: To evaluate the impact of addition of corticosteroids to the hospital protocol for treatment of suspected or confirmed CoVID-19 pneumonia on rates of death or intensive care unit (ICU) admission. METHODS: A before-after study was performed to evaluate the effect of addition of corticosteroids to our institution's COVID-19 treatment protocol on hospital mortality. RESULTS: Between March 3(rd) and April 14(th) 2020, 257 patients with CoVID-19 diagnosis were included. As corticosteroids were wide used since 27 March 2020, two periods were considered for the purposes of our study: the before period from March 3(rd) to 20(th) (n= 85) and the “after period” (n=172) from March 26(th) to April 14(th) 2020. The “after” period was associated with a lower risk of death (HR 0.47; 95% CI, 0.23 - 0.97; p=0.04), and a lower risk of intensive care admission or death before ICU admission (HR 0.37 95% CI 0.21 - 0.64; p=0.0005) by multivariate analysis adjusted for age, National Early Warning score and institutionalization status.

Therefore, antagonists of this interaction could allow a modality for therapeutic intervention. Peptides can inhibit the S-RBD:ACE2 interaction by interacting with the protein–protein interface. In this study, protein contact atlas data and molecular dynamics simulations were used to locate interaction hotspots on the secondary structure elements α1, α2, α3, β3, and β4 of ACE2. We designed a library of discontinuous peptides based upon a combination of the hotspot interactions, which were synthesized and screened in a bioluminescence-based assay. The peptides demonstrated high efficacy in antagonizing the SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD:ACE2 interaction and were validated by microscale thermophoresis which demonstrated strong binding affinity (∼10 nM) of these peptides to S-RBD.

The aim of this study is to analyze viral dynamics and the antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 in KTRs with COVID-19 and study their association with clinical data. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Consecutive KTRs diagnosed with COVID-19 at our center were evaluated for clinical presentation and outcome; duration of viral shedding and viral burden by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction assay cycle threshold; and magnitude of seroconversion to SARS-CoV-2. RESULTS: Six KTRs identified with COVID-19 were hospitalized. Presenting symptoms were similar to those in the general population. Four patients had severe disease and, of these, 2 required mechanical ventilation, 4 had acute kidney injury, and 3 had secondary bacterial infections. Immunosuppression was reduced in all patients. Five patients were treated with hydroxychloroquine. No patient required dialysis or died. Patients with severe disease had a longer duration of viral shedding, which lasted more than 40 days, and had IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2, which were detected from 3 weeks to as long as 10 weeks after symptom onset. In patients with less severe disease no IgG antibodies where detected between 9 and 14 weeks after symptom onset.

As RNA viruses have a high mutation rate therefore we wanted to identify whether this virus is also prone to mutations. For this reason we selected four major structural (Spike protein (S), Envelope protein (E), Membrane glycoprotein (M), Nucleocapsid phosphoprotein (N)) and ORF8 protein of 100 different SARS-CoV-2 isolates of fifteen countries from NCBI database and compared these to the reference sequence, Wuhan NC_045512.2, which was the first isolate of SARS-CoV-2 that was sequenced. By multiple sequence alignment of amino acids, we observed substitutions and deletion in S protein at 13 different sites in the isolates of five countries (China, USA, Finland, India and Australia) as compared to the reference sequence. Similarly, alignment of N protein revealed substitutions at three different sites in isolates of China, Spain and Japan. M protein exhibits substitution only in one isolates from USA, however, no mutation was observed in E protein of any isolate. Interestingly, in ORF8 substitution of Leucine, a nonpolar to Serine a polar amino acid at same position (aa84 L to S) in 23 isolates of five countries i.e. China, USA, Spain, Taiwan and India were observed, which may affect the conformation of peptides. Thus, we observed several mutations in the isolates thereafter the first sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 isolate, NC_045512.2, which suggested that this virus might be a threat to the whole world and therefore further studies are needed to characterize how these mutations in different proteins affect the functionality and pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2.","Shah, Abdullah; Rashid, Farooq; Aziz, Abdul; Jan, Amin Ullah; Suleman, Muhammad",Gene Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32954047/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.genrep.2020.100886; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2452014420303009?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2452014420303009,402

Ağır non-atopik astım tedavisi için son 6 aydır, mevcut astım tedavilerinin yanında, mepolizumab tedavisi uygulanan 61 yaşında erkek hasta, Eylül 2020'de kliniğimize yüksek ateş, son 3-4 günde gelişen koku ve tat duyusunda kayıp, kuru öksürük ve nefes darlığı şikayetleri ile başvurdu. Hastanın akciğer tomografisinde her iki akciğer alt lob bazal kısımlarında yama şeklinde buzlu cam dansiteleri izlendi ve hastanın SARS-CoV-2 için PCR sonucu pozitifti. Hastaya hidroksiklorokin, favipiravir ve antikoagülan tedavi başlandı ve hasta evde karantinaya alındı. Takiplerinde, tedavinin 5. gününde hastanın şikayetleri önemli ölçüde rahatladı. Ağır astım hastalarının tedavisinde kullanılan ilaçların COVID-19 enfeksiyonu üzerine etkilerini inceleyen geniş ve kapsamlı çalışmalara ihtiyaç olduğu aşikar olmakla beraber, anti-viral etkinliği sebebiyle, bu hasta grubunda, mepolizumabın COVID-19 enfeksiyonu tedavisine olumlu katkıları göz ardı edilmemeli ve takip edilmelidir.

It is argued here that autonomously elected local governments are the essential elements of civil society. A theory of the foundations of the state should begin by recognizing that states are established by leaders. Both to win power and to wield it, a leader needs an ability to make credible long-term promises of future rewards. For a successful democracy, we need that our democratic candidates should also have reputations for respecting democratic norms and for using public resources effectively in public service, and not just for reliably rewarding loyal supporters. Such reputations for democratic leadership can be generated most abundantly in local politics. In a federal democracy, successful local leaders can demonstrate their qualifications to compete for higher office. In this way, autonomously elected local governments effectively reduce entry barriers into national politics. It is suggested that Americans should never again elect anybody president who has not served responsibly in some lower public office under our constitutional system of government.","Myerson, Roger B.",Bus Econ,https://doi.org/10.1057/s11369-020-00199-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33456059/,402
684990,Skin Manifestations in COVID-19 Patients: Are They Indicators for Disease Severity? A Systematic Review,2021-02-16,"Objective: The results of numerous empirical studies have showed the occurrence of so-called unrealistic optimism. Thus, we aimed to investigate whether in the situation of an imminent coronavirus pandemic, people would still perceive themselves as being less exposed to the disease than others. Methods: Survey studies were conducted to examine the level of unrealistic optimism. Participants (n = 171, 67.3% of women) in a subjective way judged the risk of their coronavirus infection and the likelihood that this would happen to an average student of the same sex from their class. The survey was conducted in three waves: prior to the announcement of the first case of coronavirus (2–3 March), immediately after that announcement (5–6 March), and a few days later (9–10 March). Results: We showed that women estimated the chances of being infected as significantly higher (M = 4.52, SD = 2.079; t = 2.387; p = 0.018; Cohen’s d = 0.393) than men (M = 3.71, SD = 2.042). The phenomenon of unrealistic optimism was observed especially in men (as compared to other male participants) as it appeared in all three measures (M (you) = 3.95 vs. M (other male student) = 4.63; M = 3.71 vs. M = 4.68, and M = 4.46 vs. M = 5.38 in phase one, two, and three, respectively; p ≤ 0.006 for all comparison), but also in women in the last two measures (M (you) = 4.55 vs. M (other female student) = 4.95, and M = 4.99 vs. M = 5.38 in phase 2 and 3, respectively; p ≤ 0.012 for both comparisons). Conclusions: The study revealed a fairly general occurrence of unrealistic optimism, which was mainly observed in men as it appeared in all three measures, but also in women in the last two measures. This result is important for health experts who are responsible for making people comply with regulations concerning social distancing, putting masks on to stop infection, and staying at home. It is possible that unrealistically optimistic people will behave much less in line with the aforementioned recommendations, causing coronavirus to spread widely.","Dolinski, Dariusz; Dolinska, Barbara; Zmaczynska-Witek, Barbara; Banach, Maciej; Kulesza, Wojciech",J Clin Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32414182/; https://doi.org/10.3390/jcm9051464,402
685362,Systemic thrombosis in a large cohort of COVID-19 patients despite thromboprophylaxis: a retrospective study,2021-01-07,"Background: Unemployment, underemployment, and the quality of work are national occupational health risk factors that drive critical national problems; however, to date, there have been no systematic efforts to document the public health impact of this situation. Methods: An environmental scan was conducted to explore the root causes and health impacts of underemployment and unemployment and highlight multilevel perspectives and factors in the landscape of underemployment and unemployment. Methods: included a review of gray literature and research literature, followed by key informant interviews with nine organizational representatives in employment research and policy, workforce development, and industry to assess perceived needs and gaps in practice. Results: Evidence highlights the complex nature of underemployment and unemployment, with multiple macro-level underlying drivers, including the changing nature of work, a dynamic labor market, inadequate enforcement of labor protection standards, declining unions, wage depression, and weak political will interacting with multiple social determinants of health. Empirical literature on unemployment and physical, mental, and psychological well-being, substance abuse, depression in young adults, and suicides is quite extensive; however, there are limited data on the impacts of underemployment on worker health and well-being. Additionally, organizations do not routinely consider health outcomes as they relate to their work in workforce or policy development. Discussion and Conclusions: Several gaps in data and research will need to be addressed in order to assess the full magnitude of the public health burden of underemployment and unemployment. Public health needs to champion a research and practice agenda in partnership with multisector stakeholders to illuminate the role of employment quality and status in closing the gap on health inequities, and to integrate workforce health and well-being into labor and economic development agendas across government agencies and industry.","Pratap, Preethi; Dickson, Alison; Love, Marsha; Zanoni, Joe; Donato, Caitlin; Flynn, Michael A.; Schulte, Paul A.",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph181910021; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34639322/,402
685468,Colchicine use might be associated with lower mortality in COVID‐19 patients: A meta‐analysis,2021-07-18,"BACKGROUND: The COVID‐19 pandemic has led to the rapid and widespread adoption of telehealth. There is a need for more evidence regarding the appropriateness of telehealth, as well as greater understanding of barriers to its sustained use within surgery in Australia. METHODS: A survey weblink was sent via email to 5558 Australian Fellows of the Royal Australasian College of Surgeons in August 2020. A single reminder email followed this 2 weeks later. Mixed methods analysis was performed of the survey data. RESULTS: There were 683 (12.3%) complete responses. Telehealth (telephone or video‐link) consultations were undertaken by 638 (85%) respondents as a result of the pandemic, with 583 (85%) of these expressing a desire for continued access to telehealth. Seventy‐seven percent of respondents felt that a satisfactory level of care could be delivered via telehealth in half or more consultations. However, only 38% of respondents felt that quality of care was equivalent comparing telehealth and face‐to‐face consultations, with the inability to perform a clinical examination a frequent concern. The majority agreed that telehealth was appropriate for clinical meetings and arranging investigations (91% each), whereas only 22% and 17%, respectively, felt telehealth was an appropriate means to break bad news and manage conflict. Medicolegal, technical and financial concerns were raised as prominent barriers to the sustained use of telehealth. CONCLUSION: Surgeons show good insight into the clinical appropriateness and limitations of telehealth. Medicolegal, technical and financial barriers need to be addressed in order to fully utilize the benefits of telehealth into the future.","Wiadji, Elvina; Mackenzie, Lisa; Reeder, Patrick; Gani, Jonathan S.; Carroll, Rosemary; Smith, Stephen; Frydenberg, Mark; O'Neill, Christine J.",ANZ J Surg,https://doi.org/10.1111/ans.16693; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33634949/,402

This study aimed to compare the differences in clinical manifestation, laboratory results, and outcomes of neonates born to mothers with or without coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Study Design A total of 48 neonates were admitted to Tongji Hospital and HuangShi Maternal and Child Healthcare Hospital from January 17 to March 4, 2020. The neonates were divided into three groups according to the mothers' conditions: neonates born to mothers with confirmed COVID-19, neonates born to mothers with clinically diagnosed COVID-19, and neonates born to mothers without COVID-19. The clinical data of mothers and infants in the three groups were collected, compared, and analyzed. Results The deliveries occurred in a negative pressure isolation room, and the neonates were separated from their mothers immediately after birth for further observation and treatment. None of the neonates showed any signs of fever, cough, dyspnea, or diarrhea. SARS-CoV-2 reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction of the throat swab and feces samples from the neonates in all three groups was negative. No differences were detected in the whole blood cell, lymphocytes, platelet, and liver and renal function among the three groups. All mothers and their infants showed satisfactory outcomes, including a 28-week preterm infant. Conclusion The clinical manifestations, radiological, and biochemical results did not show any difference between the three groups. No evidence of vertical transmission was found in this study whether the pregnant women developed coronavirus infection in the third (14 cases) or second trimester (1 case). Key points: Characteristics of neonates born to mothers with and without COVID-19 have been compared. All the 48 cases presented in the study had good outcomes. A 28-week preterm born to COVID-19 mother presented to be clear of SARS-COV-2 infection.","Liu, Wei; Cheng, Hongbin; Wang, Jing; Ding, Lingli; Zhou, Zhaoxian; Liu, Siying; Chang, Liwen; Rong, Zhihui",Am J Perinatol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32892325/; https://doi.org/10.1055/s-0040-1716505,402

Our goal was to illustrate the diversity and beauty of fungal plant pathogens through a naturalist approach that could be followed by any amateur. We achieved this end through ‘phytopathological strolls’, in which we observed and determined the origin of symptoms on diseased plants found in our garden, in the local streets, in nearby open spaces, and sharing this matter with a broad public. The lockdown imposed in France created an additional motivation to take up the challenge, and to involve our children, even under strong constraints, such as movement restrictions. We observed and described fungal pathogens through hundreds of photographs, shared our findings with a large audience on Twitter, and received feedback. The material used was deliberately simple and transportable: a digital reflex camera, an old microscope, a mobile phone, some books and an Internet connexion. Between March 17, 2020 and June 20, 2021 we found 196 plant pathogens, including 97 rusts, 27 powdery mildews and 28 septoria-like diseases. We discuss here the importance of promoting searches for plant pathogens, their description and conservation, through a combination of classical approaches and digital tools in tune with the times, such as Twitter, by treating pathogen identification like a detective game and, more surprisingly, by making use of the addictive nature of collection approaches, drawing a parallel with Pokémon Go.","Suffert, Frédéric; Suffert, Muriel",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.02.03.429201,402

Many unfavorable health outcomes among elderly people are associated with nutrition. Nutrition in elderly people is affected by physical, mental, and social factors. This study explored the food choices and dietary practices among community-dwelling elderly people in Thailand from the perspective of both caregivers and the elderly people themselves. Six focus group discussions and six semistructured interviews were conducted in the Samut Sakhon Province of Thailand. Deductive thematic analyses were conducted based on the “food choice process model framework.” The results show that physical and mental factors and societal factors are important determinants of food choices. Moreover, a changing food environment and economic factors were found to affect food choices. Issues of trust in food safety and food markets were highlighted as growing issues. Therefore, fostering healthy food choice interventions that consider both environmental and societal aspects is necessary.","Chalermsri, Chalobol; Herzig van Wees, Sibylle; Ziaei, Shirin; Ekström, Eva-Charlotte; Muangpaisan, Weerasak; Rahman, Syed Moshfiqur",Nutrients,https://doi.org/10.3390/nu12113497; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33203013/,402

To treat these complications, their underlying etiology must be identified. Thus, a novel AI-based methodology, MOATAI-VIR, which predicts disease-protein-pathway relationships for 22 clinical manifestations attributed to COVID-19 was developed. SARS-CoV-2 interacting human proteins and GWAS identified respiratory failure associated risk genes provide the input from which the mode-of-action (MOA) proteins/pathways of the resulting disease comorbidities are predicted. These comorbidities are then mapped to their clinical manifestations. Three uncharacterized manifestation categories are found: neoplasms, mental and behavioral disorders, and congenital malformations, deformations, and chromosomal abnormalities. The prevalence of neoplasms suggests a possible association between COVID-19 and cancer, whether by shared molecular mechanisms between oncogenesis and viral replication, or perhaps, SARS-CoV-2 is an oncovirus. To assess the molecular basis of each manifestation, the proteins shared across each group of comorbidities were prioritized and subject to global pathway analysis. From these most frequent pathways, the molecular features associated with hallmark COVID-19 phenotypes, such as loss of sense of smell/taste, unusual neurological symptoms, cytokine storm, and blood clots were explored.

METHODS: We analysed prospectively collected, pseudonymized data on 959 356 employees who were continuously employed by National Health Service trusts in England from 1 January 2019 to 31 July 2020, comparing the frequency of new sickness absence in 2020 with that at corresponding times in 2019. RESULTS: After exclusion of episodes directly related to COVID-19, the overall incidence of sickness absence during the initial 10 weeks of the pandemic (March–May 2020) was more than 20% lower than in corresponding weeks of 2019. Trends for specific categories of illness varied substantially, with a fall by 24% for cancer, but an increase for mental illness. A doubling of new absences for pregnancy-related disorders during May–July of 2020 was limited to women with earlier COVID-19 sickness absence. CONCLUSIONS: Various factors will have contributed to the large and divergent changes that were observed. The findings reinforce concerns regarding delays in diagnosis and treatment of cancers and support a need to plan for a large backlog of treatment for many other diseases. Further research should explore the rise in absence for pregnancy-related disorders among women with earlier COVID-19 sickness absence.","Edge, Rhiannon; van der Plaat, Diana A; Parsons, Vaughan; Coggon, David; van Tongeren, Martie; Muiry, Rupert; Madan, Ira; Cullinan, Paul",J Public Health (Oxf),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34514506/; https://doi.org/10.1093/pubmed/fdab341,402

Therefore, we perform a systematic review and meta-analysis to investigate the effect of antiplatelet treatments on patients with COVID-19 infection. An electronic search was carried out in Pubmed, Embase, Cochrane library, Web of Science, MEDLINE, Wanfang and China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI). Meta-analysis and statistical analyses were completed with using the RevMan 5.3 and Stata 12.0. A total of 9 articles representing data from 5970 participants were included in this study.

The results of this study reveal that while there is no significant benefit on mortality demonstrated with the use of antiplatelet agents, the upper bound of the confidence interval suggests that there is unlikely to be a compelling risk of harm associated with this practice.

688948,Novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in children,2020-04-21,"Co-infection has been reported in patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome, but there is limited knowledge on co-infection among patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The prevalence of co-infection was variable among COVID-19 patients in different studies, however, it could be up to 50% among non-survivors. Co-pathogens included bacteria, such as Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydia pneumonia, Legionella pneumophila and Acinetobacter baumannii; Candida species and Aspergillus flavus; and viruses such as influenza, coronavirus, rhinovirus/enterovirus, parainfluenza, metapneumovirus, influenza B virus, and human immunodeficiency virus. Influenza A was one of the most common co-infective viruses, which may have caused initial false-negative results of real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Laboratory and imaging findings alone cannot help distinguish co-infection from SARS-CoV-2 infection. Newly developed syndromic multiplex panels that incorporate SARS-CoV-2 may facilitate the early detection of co-infection among COVID-19 patients. By contrast, clinicians cannot rule out SARS-CoV-2 infection by ruling in other respiratory pathogens through old syndromic multiplex panels at this stage of the COVID-19 pandemic. Therefore, clinicians must have a high index of suspicion for coinfection among COVID-19 patients. Clinicians can neither rule out other co-infections caused by respiratory pathogens by diagnosing SARS-CoV-2 infection nor rule out COVID-19 by detection of non-SARS-CoV-2 respiratory pathogens. After recognizing the possible pathogens causing co-infection among COVID-19 patients, appropriate antimicrobial agents can be recommended.","Lai, Chih-Cheng; Wang, Cheng-Yi; Hsueh, Po-Ren","Journal of microbiology, immunology, and infection = Wei mian yu gan ran za zhi",https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1684118220301274; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmii.2020.05.013; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32482366/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1684118220301274?v=s5,402
688996,The role of essential organ-based comorbidities in the prognosis of COVID-19 infection patients,2020-04-28,"Skilled nursing facilities (SNFs) are focal points of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, and asymptomatic infections with SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, among SNF residents and health care personnel have been described (1-3). Repeated point prevalence surveys (serial testing of all residents and health care personnel at a health care facility irrespective of symptoms) have been used to identify asymptomatic infections and have reduced SARS-CoV-2 transmission during SNF outbreaks (1,3). During March 2020, the Detroit Health Department and area hospitals detected a sharp increase in COVID-19 diagnoses, hospitalizations, and associated deaths among SNF residents. The Detroit Health Department collaborated with local government, academic, and health care system partners and a CDC field team to rapidly expand SARS-CoV-2 testing and implement infection prevention and control (IPC) activities in all Detroit-area SNFs. During March 7-May 8, among 2,773 residents of 26 Detroit SNFs, 1,207 laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID-19 were identified during three periods: before (March 7-April 7) and after two point prevalence surveys (April 8-25 and April 30-May 8): the overall attack rate was 44%. Within 21 days of receiving their first positive test results, 446 (37%) of 1,207 COVID-19 patients were hospitalized, and 287 (24%) died. Among facilities participating in both surveys (n = 12), the percentage of positive test results declined from 35% to 18%. Repeated point prevalence surveys in SNFs identified asymptomatic COVID-19 cases, informed cohorting and IPC practices aimed at reducing transmission, and guided prioritization of health department resources for facilities experiencing high levels of SARS-CoV-2 transmission. With the increased availability of SARS-CoV-2 testing, repeated point prevalence surveys and enhanced and expanded IPC support should be standard tools for interrupting and preventing COVID-19 outbreaks in SNFs.","Sanchez, Guillermo V.; Biedron, Caitlin; Fink, Lauren R.; Hatfield, Kelly M.; Polistico, Jordan Micah F.; Meyer, Monica P.; Noe, Rebecca S.; Copen, Casey E.; Lyons, Amanda K.; Gonzalez, Gonzalo; Kiama, Keith; Lebednick, Mark; Czander, Bonnie K.; Agbonze, Amen; Surma, Aimee R.; Sandhu, Avnish; Mika, Valerie H.; Prentiss, Tyler; Zervos, John; Dalal, Donia A.; Vasquez, Amber M.; Reddy, Sujan C.; Jernigan, John; Kilgore, Paul E.; Zervos, Marcus J.; Chopra, Teena; Bezold, Carla P.; Rehman, Najibah K.",MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32644985/; https://doi.org/10.15585/mmwr.mm6927e1,402

Global research efforts have focused on developing effective vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 and the disease it causes, COVID-19. However, some of the basic epidemiological parameters, such as the exponential epidemic growth rate and the basic reproductive number, R0, across geographic areas are still not well quantified. Here, we developed and fit a mathematical model to case and death count data collected from the United States and eight European countries during the early epidemic period before broad control measures were implemented. Results show that the early epidemic grew exponentially at rates between 0.19-0.29/day (epidemic doubling times between 2.4-3.6 days). We discuss the current estimates of the mean serial interval, and argue that existing evidence suggests that the interval is between 6-8 days in the absence of active isolation efforts. Using parameters consistent with this range, we estimated the median R0 value to be 5.8 (confidence interval: 4.7-7.3) in the United States and between 3.6 and 6.1 in the eight European countries. This translates to herd immunity thresholds needed to stop transmission to be between 73% and 84%. We further analyze how vaccination schedules depends on R0, the duration of vaccine-induced immunity to SARS-CoV-2, and show that individual-level heterogeneity in vaccine induced immunity can significantly affect vaccination schedules.","Ke, R.; Romero-Severson, E.

689902,"Trying times for heart failure trials during the COVID-19 pandemic: American heart failure specialist William T. Abraham of the Wexler Medical Centre of Ohio State University talks to CardioPulse about the ramifications of the COVID-19 pandemic in relation to ongoing and future heart failure (HF) studies, and outlines some guiding principles and possible solutions",2020-05-07,"In this paper, we investigate the relationship between adverse economic circumstances and the desire of Dutch households to move up or down the urban hierarchy. We apply three consecutive waves of the Dutch Housing Demand Survey (WoON) in a repeated cross-section setting, with data collected at the time of the Global Financial Crisis (GFC) and its aftermath. We find that households desire to move down the urban hierarchy during the volatile and uncertain periods following the GFC. This is a surprising result, given that urban areas are generally considered more opportunity rich. In order to uncover the mechanisms driving this result, we considered the impact of the economic circumstances on the general willingness to move and on the underlying motives. We find that willingness to move increased when the adverse economic consequences of the GFC hit Dutch households. Further, it appears that this willingness to move is only partially related to work. Besides work, desires to move for health, education, vicinity to family and friends, and reasons related to the dwelling, also become more prevalent during the aftermath of the GFC as well. This heterogeneity in impacts and consequences for household desired mobility serves to explain some of the mixed results in the literature, and generates lessons for current and future crises such as the Covid-19 pandemic.","van Leeuwen, Eveline S.; Venhorst, Viktor A.",J Geogr Syst,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34054335/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s10109-021-00353-7,402

690032,The effect of COVID-19 epidemic on vital signs in hospitalized patients: a pre-post heat-map study from a large teaching hospital,2021-05-10,"Objective: Our aim was to assess Siaya county COVID-19 preparedness at community and health facility levels and measure baseline household prevalences of fever and cough. Design: There was retrospective and prospective data collection using standard tools. We determined the prevalence of fever and cough in households. We evaluated household knowledge about COVID-19 prevention and adherence to preventive measures. We evaluated the presence of a workforce, essential infrastructure and equipment needed for COVID-19 case management, and the availability of essential maternal and child health services in health facilities. Setting: Siaya in rural Western Kenya Participants: households and health facilities in Siaya Results: We visited 19474 households and assessed 152 facilities. The prevalences of fever and cough ranged from 1.4% to 4.3% and 0.2 to 0.8% respectively ; 97% and 98% of households had not received a guest from nor travelled outside Siaya respectively; 97% knew about frequent handwashing, 66% knew about keeping distance, and 80% knew about wearing a mask; 63% washed their hands countless times; 53% remained home; and 74% used a mask when out in public. The health facility assessment showed: 93.6% were dispensaries and health centers; 90.4% had nurses; 40.5% had oxygen capacity; 13.5% had pulse oximeters; and 2 ventilators were available; 94.2% of facilities did not have COVID-19 testing kits; 94% and 91% of facilities continued to provide antenatal care and immunization services respectively. Health care worker training in COVID-19 had been planned. Conclusions: Household prevalence of fever and cough was low suggesting Siaya had not entered the active community transmission phase in June 2020. Our assessment revealed a need for training in COVID-19 case management, and a need for basic equipment and supplies including pulse oximeters and oxygen. Future interventions should address these gaps. Strengths and limitations: This study provides an example of how to successfully carry out an integrated rural health system baseline assessment of COVID-19 preparedness; an approach that would be useful for any country experiencing COVID-19 with a significant rural population. Some of our data were retrospective in nature and therefore vulnerable to multiple sources of bias including: recall bias and misclassification.","Kaseje, N.; Kaseje, D.; Oruenjo, K.; Ocholla Odhiambo, P.; Kaseje, M.; Achola, S.; Tanner, M.; Haines, A.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.07.21251312v1?rss=1; https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.02.07.21251312,402

690167,Obesity and sleep apnea as a significant comorbidities in COVID-19 — A case report,2021-04-27,"Abstract The coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus-A59 (MHV-A59) encodes a serine-like proteinase (3C-like proteinase or 3CLpro) in ORF 1a of gene 1 between nucleotides 10209 and 11114. We previously have demonstrated that proteins expressedin vitrofrom a cDNA clone of the 3CLpro region possess proteinase activity, and that the proteinase is able to cleave substratein trans.We sought to determine if the 27-kDain vitrocleavage product (p27) was an active form of the 3CLpro and whether this was consistent with the 3CLpro expressed in virus-infected cells. Antibodies directed against the 3CLpro domain detected 27-kDa MHV proteinsin vitroand in MHV-A59-infected cells. The 27-kDa proteins were able to cleave substratein transwithout other protein cofactors or supplemental membranes, and the p27 proteinase activity was retained after purification by immunoprecipitation and gel electrophoresis. When p27 was expressedin vitrowith portions of the amino- and carboxy-terminal flanking domains (MP1 and MP2), p27 was not liberated byciscleavage. The proteolytic activity of the 27-kDa proteins was inhibited by a variety of cysteine and serine proteinase inhibitors, and was eliminated by the cysteine proteinase inhibitor E64d. These results indicate that the 27-kDa protein is a mature proteinase in MHV-A59-infected cells, and that appropriate processing of this molecule occursin vitro.","Lu, Xiaotao; Lu, Yiqi; Denison, Mark R.",Virology,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0042682296904341; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042682296904341; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8806521/,402
