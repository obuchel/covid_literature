4703,"Aufgaben und Funktion der Ständigen Arbeitsgemeinschaft der Kompetenz- und Behandlungszentren für hochkontagiöse, lebensbedrohliche Erkrankungen",2009-02-12,"PURPOSE: To provide recommendations and standard operating procedures for intensive care unit (ICU) and hospital preparations for a mass disaster or influenza epidemic with a specific focus on surge capacity and infrastructure considerations. METHODS: Based on a literature review and expert opinion, a Delphi process was used to define the essential topics including surge capacity and infrastructure considerations. RESULTS: Key recommendations include: (1) hospitals should increase their ICU beds to the maximal extent by expanding ICU capacity and expanding ICUs into other areas; (2) hospitals should have appropriate beds and monitors for these expansion areas; hospitals should develop contingency plans at the facility and government (local, state, provincial, national) levels to provide additional ventilators; (3) hospitals should develop a phased staffing plan (nursing and physician) for ICUs that provides sufficient patient care supervision during contingency and crisis situations; (4) hospitals should provide expert input to the emergency management personnel at the hospital both during planning for surge capacity as well as during response; (5) hospitals should assure that adequate infrastructure support is present to support critical care activities; (6) hospitals should prioritize locations for expansion by expanding existing ICUs, using postanesthesia care units and emergency departments to capacity, then step-down units, large procedure suites, telemetry units and finally hospital wards. CONCLUSIONS: Judicious planning and adoption of protocols for surge capacity and infrastructure considerations are necessary to optimize outcomes during a pandemic.","Hick, John L.; Christian, Michael D.; Sprung, Charles L.",Intensive Care Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7079872/,450

It is, therefore, of prime importance that the development of new synthetic strategies and designing of new isoxazole derivatives should be based on the most recent knowledge emerging from the latest research. This review is an endeavor to highlight the progress in the chemistry and biological activity of isoxazole derivatives which could provide a low-height flying bird’s eye view of isoxazole derivatives to the medicinal chemists for the development of clinically viable drugs using this information.","Agrawal, Neetu; Mishra, Pradeep",Med Chem Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7079875/,450

As of yet, there are no studies in Germany describing the difficulties experienced by GPs in patient care during epidemics/pandemics. OBJECTIVES: This study aimed at identifying the problem areas in GPs’ patient care during the H1N1 and EHEC (enterohemorrhagic strain of Escherichia coli) outbreaks. With this information, recommendations for guaranteeing proper patient care during future epidemics/pandemics can be derived. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In all, 12 qualitative, semi-structured, open guideline interviews with GPs in Hamburg and Lübeck were conducted, transcribed, and evaluated with qualitative content analysis. RESULTS: Five areas in ambulatory patient care were identified in which changes are needed from the primary care perspective: provision of information for GPs, workload, financing of epidemic-related measures, organization of the practices, care of those taken ill. CONCLUSIONS: The workload of GPs in particular can and should be reduced through successful, centralized information distribution during epidemics/pandemics. The GP’s function as a coordinator should be supported and consolidated, in order to relieve the in-patient sector in cases of an epidemic/pandemic. Secured financing of epidemic-associated measures can help ensure patient care.","Eisele, Marion; Hansen, Heike; Wagner, Hans-Otto; von Leitner, Eike; Pohontsch, Nadine; Scherer, Martin",Bundesgesundheitsblatt Gesundheitsforschung Gesundheitsschutz,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7079901/,450

Their significance lies in the large number of cases that occur, the high case fatality ratio of certain zoonoses, and the potential for some pathogens as yet restricted to animal hosts to cross the species barrier and infect humans. Changing habits in food production (for example, intensive animal husbandry) and food consumption as well as demographic, climatic, and ecological factors contribute to the spread of zoonotic pathogens. Several zoonoses are notifiable in Germany according to the Protection Against Infection Act enacted 1 January 2001. The European Commission issued a new directive on the monitoring of zoonoses and zoonotic agents on 17 November 2003. There is ongoing need to develop further measures to prevent and control zoonotic diseases on a national as well as international basis.","Alpers, K.; Stark, K.; Hellenbrand, W.; Ammon, A.",Bundesgesundheitsblatt Gesundheitsforschung Gesundheitsschutz,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7079913/,450

At first the results were unsatisfactory, but today's results after living donation are as good as those obtained after conventional liver transplantation with full-sized organs. With minimally invasive diagnostic methods, it is now possible to determine the quality of potential donor livers and exclude focal lesions and anatomical variants which influence the strategy of organ retrieval procedures. Donor liver resection is done without hilar occlusion after determining the anatomical variants of the bile system (especially for right lobes) and localizing of the course of the middle hepatic vein. Microsurgical techniques are used for reconstruction of the biliary system and hepatic vessels. Living-donor liver transplantation allows us to investigate the complex changes after liver resection. The surgical techniques and pathophysiological postoperative changes can be adapted unconventionally to complex oncological liver resections.

ANG II has many pleiotropic effects on the kidney such as pro–inflammatory and profibrotic actions besides the well–known blood pressure–increasing effect. NOVEL KNOWLEDGE: Organs have local ANG II–generating systems that work independently from their classic systemic counterpart. Renal proximal tubular cells could generate and secrete ANG II into the urine in concentrations that are 10,000 times higher than those found in serum. These local systems are only incompletely blocked by currently used doses of ACE inhibitors or AT(1) antagonists. There are other enzyme systems besides ACE that contribute to the formation of ANG II. Alternative pathways generate peptides such as angiotensin 1–7 that have antagonistic effect compared with ANG II. Degradation products of ANG II such as angiotensin IV bind at separate receptors and could mediate fibrosis. The discovery of AT(1) receptor dimers and agonistic antibodies against AT(1) receptors contributes to the complexity of the system. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: The complexity of the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system (RAAS) implies that dual blockade with ACE inhibitors and AT(1) receptor antagonists makes sense for pathophysiological reasons. First clinical studies have shown that such as dual therapy reduces progression of chronic renal disease more efficiently that the respective monotherapies in certain risk populations. This shows that novel pathophysiological data could lead to innovative clinical treatment strategies.","Wolf, Gunter",Med Klin (Munich),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7079980/,450

This paper reviews the various issues that have contributed to this trend. In response to the need for a science-based approach to home hygiene, the International Scientific Forum on Home Hygiene has developed an approach based on risk management which involves identifying the critical control points for preventing the spread of infectious diseases in the home. If we are to be successful in achieving behaviour change in the community, we need to develop a family-centred approach which ensures an understanding of infectious disease agents and their mechanism of spread.","Bloomfield, S.

This is primarily due to the fact that pregnant women, in the majority of cases, do not notice any complaints or only have unspecific flu-like symptoms (e.g. toxoplasmosis). Serological screening within the framework of German maternity care is often insufficient to diagnose existing or emerging infections in time. However, the long-term consequences for the affected children and their parents can be immense.

To prepare soluble and bioactive recombinant human FGF23 to meet the increasing demand in its pharmacological application, small ubiquitin-related modifier (SUMO)-FGF23 fusion gene and FGF23 non-fusion gene were amplified by standard PCR methods and cloned into vector pET-22b and pET-3c, then transformed into Escherichia coli Rosetta (DE3) and BL21 (DE3). The best combination of plasmid and host strain was screened, and only Rosetta (DE3)/pET-SUMO-FGF23 was screened for rhFGF23 protein expressed. The average bacterial yield and the soluble expression level of recombinant hFGF23 of three batches attained 687 ± 18 g and 30 ± 1.5%, respectively, after treatment with 0.4 mM isopropyl-thio-β-galactopyranoside for 19 h at 16 °C in a 30-L fermentor, after which it was purified by DEAE Sepharose FF and nickel nitrilotriacetic acid affinity chromatography. Once cleaved by the SUMO protease, the recombinant human FGF23 was released from the fusion protein. The purity of rFGF23 was shown by high performance liquid chromatography to be greater than 90% and the yield was 60 ± 1.5 mg/L. In vitro data showed that the purified rFGF23 can induce the phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinases in the glioma U251 cell. The results of in vivo animal experiments also showed that rFGF23 could decrease the concentration in the plasma of normal rats fed with a fixed formula diet.

The specific affinity reaction of nucleic acids (hybridization) and antibodies towards antigens is the most common bioanalytical method for generating multiplexed quantitative results.

Antibodies are more universal biomolecular receptors that selectively bind small molecules such as pesticides, small toxins, and pharmaceuticals and to biopolymers (e.g. toxins, allergens) and complex biological structures like bacterial cells and viruses. By producing an appropriate antibody, the corresponding antigenic analyte can be detected on a multiplexed immunoanalytical microarray. Food and water analysis along with clinical diagnostics constitute potential application fields for multiplexed analysis. Diverse fluorescence, chemiluminescence, electrochemical, and label-free microarray readout systems have been developed in the last decade. Some of them are constructed as flow-through microarrays by combination with a fluidic system. Microarrays have the potential to become widely accepted as a system for analytical applications, provided that robust and validated results on fully automated platforms are successfully generated.

Because of the difference in population sizes, the urban centre has standard incidence and satellite cities have mass action incidence. It is shown that the general basic reproduction number [Formula: see text] acts as a threshold between global asymptotic stability of the disease free equilibrium and disease persistence. The case of Winnipeg (MB, Canada) and some neighbouring satellite communities is then considered numerically to complement the mathematical analysis, highlighting the importance of taking into account not only [Formula: see text] but also other measures of disease severity. It is found that the large urban centre governs most of the behaviour of the general system and control of the spread is better achieved by targeting it rather than reducing movement between the units. Also, the capacity of a satellite city to affect the general system depends on its population size and its connectivity to the main urban centre.","Arino, Julien; Portet, Stéphanie",J Math Biol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7080072/,450

During an outbreak of such a disease, the environment that the infectious agent experiences is therefore changing due to the subsequent control measures taken. In our model, we introduce a general branching process in a changing (but not random) environment. With this branching process, we estimate the probability of extinction and the expected number of infected individuals for different control measures. We also use this branching process to calculate the generating function of the number of infected individuals at any given moment. The model and methods are designed using important infections of farmed animals, such as classical swine fever, foot-and-mouth disease and avian influenza as motivating examples, but have a wider application, for example to emerging human infections that lead to strict quarantine of cases and suspected cases (e.g. SARS) and contact and movement restrictions.","Trapman, Pieter; Meester, Ronald; Heesterbeek, Hans",J Math Biol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7080114/,450

I resolve this dilemma by showing how the SIR dynamics can be modeled with a system of three nonlinear ODE’s. The method makes use of the probability generating function (PGF) formalism for representing the degree distribution of a random network and makes use of network-centric quantities such as the number of edges in a well-defined category rather than node-centric quantities such as the number of infecteds or susceptibles. The PGF provides a simple means of translating between network and node-centric variables and determining the epidemic incidence at any time. The theory also provides a simple means of tracking the evolution of the degree distribution among susceptibles or infecteds. The equations are used to demonstrate the dramatic effects that the degree distribution plays on the final size of an epidemic as well as the speed with which it spreads through the population. Power law degree distributions are observed to generate an almost immediate expansion phase yet have a smaller final size compared to homogeneous degree distributions such as the Poisson. The equations are compared to stochastic simulations, which show good agreement with the theory. Finally, the dynamic equations provide an alternative way of determining the epidemic threshold where large-scale epidemics are expected to occur, and below which epidemic behavior is limited to finite-sized outbreaks.","Volz, Erik",J Math Biol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7080148/,450

New targeted and individualized therapies and drugs provide a survival benefit for an increasing number of patients, but can also cause severe side effects. An increasing number of oncology patients are admitted to intensive care units (ICU) because of cancer-related complications or treatment-associated side effects. Postoperative care, respiratory distress and sepsis are the leading causes for admission. Tumor mass syndromes and tumor lysis may require urgent treatment. Traditional anticancer chemotherapy is associated with infections and immunosuppression. Newer agents are generally well-tolerated and side effects are mild or moderate, but overwhelming inflammation and autoimmunity can also occur. Cellular treatment, such as with chimeric antigen receptor modified T‑cells, monoclonal and bispecific antibodies targeting immune effectors and tumor cells are associated with cytokine release syndrome (CRS) with hypotension, skin reactions and fever.

We hypothesized that psoas:lumbar vertebral index (PLVI), a measure of central sarcopenia, is associated with increased morbidity and mortality in elderly trauma patients. METHODS: A query of our institutional trauma registry from 2005 to 2010 was performed. Data was collected prospectively for the Pennsylvania Trauma Outcomes Study (PTOS). Inclusion criteria: age >55 years, ISS >15, and ICU LOS >48 h. Using admission CT scans, psoas:vertebral index was computed as the ratio between the mean cross-sectional areas of the psoas muscles and the L4 vertebral body at the level of the L4 pedicles. The 50th percentile of the psoas:L4 vertebral index value was determined, and patients were grouped into high (>0.84) and low (≤0.83) categories based on their relation to the cohort median. Primary endpoints were mortality and morbidity (as a combined endpoint for PTOS-defined complications). Univariate logistic regression was used to test the association between patient factors and mortality. Factors found to be associated with mortality at p < 0.1 were entered into a multivariable model. RESULTS: A total of 180 patients met the study criteria. Median age was 74 years (IQR 63–82), median ISS was 24 (IQR 18–29). Patients were 58 % male and 66 % Caucasian. Mean PLVI was 0.86 (SD 0.25) and was higher in male patients than female patients (0.91 ± 0.26 vs. 0.77 ± 0.21, p < 0.001). PLVI was not associated with mortality in univariate or multivariable modeling. After controlling for comorbidities, ISS, and admission SBP, low PLVI was found to be strongly associated with morbidity (OR 4.91, 95 % CI 2.28–10.60). CONCLUSIONS: Psoas:lumbar vertebral index is independently and negatively associated with posttraumatic morbidity but not mortality in elderly, severely injured trauma patients. PLVI can be calculated quickly and easily and may help identify patients at increased risk of complications.","Ebbeling, L.; Grabo, D. J.; Shashaty, M.; Dua, R.; Sonnad, S. S.; Sims, C.

Of 13 patients, 3 died of bacterial pneumonia, all of them during granulocytopenia; 2 of 6 patients died of fungal pneumonia and 2 out of 3 of a mixed bacterialmycotic infection. Adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) led to death in 2 patients. A granulocyte count under 500/µl correlated significantly (P<0.002) with the fatal outcome of bacterial, fungal and ARDS pneumonia as well as with bronchitis. Viral pneumonia led to death in 8 of 9 patients; in each there was a significant correlation (P<0.05) with graft-versus-host disease (GvHD). Patients with repeated episodes of pulmonary illness had significantly more chronic GvHD (P<0.05); several of these patients displayed a reduction in helper T cells and an increase in suppressor T cells in the peripheral blood. The natural killer (NK) cells were reduced and the percentage of activated NK cell level lay between 6% and 69%. B-cells were absent or deficient. These findings explain in part the absence of specific antibody reactivity. Five of these patients also contracted GvHD-associated obstructive bronchiolitis, which did not respond to therapy. Pulmonary infiltrates of unknown origin (including idiopathic interstitial pneumonia) occurred in 8 of the patients (11.1%), with a fatal outcome in 3 patients. Significant changes (P<0.05) in lung function after BMT appeared in the form of reduced vital capacity (VC) increased residual volume (RV) and an increase in RV expressed as the percentage of total lung capacity. Pulmonary diseases were the most common complication and cause of death in our patients after BMT.","Link, H.; Reinhard, U.; Walter, E.; Wernet, P.; Schneider, E.

HYPOTHESIS/OBJECTIVES: To compare the acid‐base changes in dogs with parvoviral enteritis (PE) using the Henderson‐Hasselbalch (HH) approach, with 2 strong ion approaches. ANIMALS: Forty‐four dogs with PE, and 16 age‐matched control dogs. METHODS: Prospective controlled observational study. Acid‐base status was evaluated using the HH model, Fencl‐Stewart (FS) approach and a validated strong ion model (VDM). The acid‐base changes according to each model were classified and compared. Statistical correlations between pH, CO(2), and various SIM variables were performed, as well as between the sum of effects (SOE) of the SIM and the individual variables comprising the SOE. RESULTS: The HH model identified acid‐base disorders in 31/44 cases of which 16/31 were mixed with metabolic acidosis and concurrent respiratory alkalosis the most common (10/31). Using the FS approach, metabolic changes were present 36/42 cases, with changes in free water (FW), chloride, and unmeasured anions (UA) being the most prevalent. Both FW and UA correlated well with pH; however, UA were most consistently abnormal in severe acidemia. Similarly to the HH, the VDM detected acid‐base disturbances in 28/44 cases. Major contributors to the acid‐base changes were hyponatremia, hypochloremia, and A(tot) acidosis because of elevated globulins and increased UA. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: Acid‐base changes are common and complex in dogs with PE, and were easier to understand using a SIM paradigm. Increases in UA have not been documented in PE in dogs.","Burchell, Richard K.; Gal, Arnon; Friedlein, Ryan; Leisewitz, Andrew L.",J Vet Intern Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7096617/,450

METHODS: Between May 2011 and July 2014, 33 pediatric patients with pneumonia caused by aspiration of oil-based substances were admitted to the Guangzhou Women and Children’s Medical Center, Guangdong, China. Data on the demographics of these patients, as well as that on clinical presentations, imagenological characteristics, history of ingestion, laboratory observations, treatment protocol, response to therapy, BAL findings, and treatment outcomes were collected. RESULTS: The study group consisted of 23 boys (69.7 %) and 10 girls (30.3 %), with ages ranging from 4 mo to 4 y. They were admitted to the hospital 2 h to 13 d after ingesting the oil-based substance. By the time of admission, most patients presented with respiratory distress and other symptoms, including tachypnea (n = 21), cough (n = 25), mild fever (n = 18), progressive dyspnea (n = 12), and pneumorrhagia (n = 5); six patients received mechanical ventilation because of complicated respiratory distress syndrome. The most common laboratory observations were leukocytosis (25 of 33, 75.8 %), neutrophilia (23 of 33, 69.7 %), and anemia (8 of 33, 24.2 %). Serum biochemical examination showed elevated sedimentation rates (24 of 33, 72.7 %), lactate dehydrogenase levels (18 of 33, 54.5 %), and C-reactive protein levels (17 of 33, 51.5 %). The most common finding on computed tomography (CT) scans was areas of consolidation. Within the follow-up duration of 2 wk to 6 mo, all patients with clinical symptoms of ELP experienced remission, and none died. The CT scans of most of the cases were normal by 1 to 3 mo, except for two patients who showed complete improvement 6 mo after treatment. CONCLUSIONS: It was found that multiple BALs combined with steroid therapy result in significant improvement of clinical, radiologic, and laboratory parameters in children with acute ELP. Further, some traditional practices may predispose children to ELP, even in the absence of underlying risk factors. Finally, pneumorrhagia and acute respiratory distress syndrome may be the main complications of acute ELP in children.","Lu, Gen; Xie, Yaping; Huang, Li; Tong, Zhijie; Xie, Zhiwei; Yu, Jialu; Wu, Peiqiong",Indian J Pediatr,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7101684/,450

In this study, we examine the role of podocytic angiotensin II receptor subtype 1 (AT1R) and prorenin receptor (PRR) in podocytic apoptosis in IgAN. Polymeric IgA (pIgA) was isolated from patients with IgAN and healthy controls. Conditioned media were prepared from growth arrested human mesangial cells (HMC) incubated with pIgA from patients with IgAN (IgA-HMC media) or healthy controls (Ctl-HMC media). A human podocyte cell line was used as a model to examine the regulation of the expression of AT1R, PRR, TNF-α and CTGF by IgA-HMC media. Podocytic nephrin expression, annexin V binding and caspase 3 activity were used as the functional readout of podocytic apoptosis. IgA-HMC media had no effect on AngII release by podocytes. IgA-HMC media significantly up-regulated the expression of AT1R and PRR, down-regulated nephrin expression and induced apoptosis in podocytes. Mono-blockade of AT1R, PRR, TNF-α or CTGF partially reduced podocytic apoptosis. IgA-HMC media activated NFκB, notch1 and HEY1 expression by podocytes and dual blockade of AT1R with PRR, or anti-TNF-α with anti-CTGF, effectively rescued the podocytic apoptosis induced by IgA-HMC media. Our data suggests that pIgA-activated HMC up-regulates the expression of AT1R and PRR expression by podocytes and the associated activation of NFκB and notch signalling pathways play an essential role in the podocytic apoptosis induced by glomerulo-podocytic communication in IgAN. Simultaneously targeting the AT1R and PRR could be a potential therapeutic option to reduce the podocytic injury in IgAN.

Male Wistar rats were rendered endotoxemic by intra-peritoneal injection of LPS (15 mg/kg body weight). We examined the expression of protein and mRNA and the immunohistochemical localization of PAR isoforms in lung tissues 1, 3, 6, and 10 h after LPS administration. Induction of ALI by LPS was confirmed based on histopathological changes. LPS administration induced significant increases in the expression of PAR isoforms (protein) at the level of transcription in ALI. While the time course of PAR-1 and -2 expressions were different, those of PAR-3 and -4 were almost similar. An immunohistochemical analysis showed localization of PAR isoforms in the vascular endothelium, alveolar epithelium, and alveolar macrophages. However, the cellular distribution patterns of PAR isoforms were different. We conclude that LPS induces increase in protein expression of PAR isoforms at the level of transcription in rats with ALI. The differential expression patterns (over a time course) and distribution of PAR isoforms suggests a distinct role for each isoform in the pathogenesis of LPS-induced ALI.","Jesmin, Subrina; Gando, Satoshi; Zaedi, Sohel; Sakuraya, Fumika",Inflammation,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7102102/,450

However, there is no comprehensive study on the role of NOXs in high glucose (HG)-induced toxic effect in neural tissues. Recently, a therapeutic strategy in oxidative related pathologies has been introduced by blocking the undesirable actions of NOX enzymes by small molecules. The protective roles of Statins in ameliorating oxidative stress by NOX inhibition have been shown in some tissues except neural. We hypothesized then, that different NOXs may have role in HG-induced neural cell injury. Furthermore, we postulate that Atorvastatin as a small molecule may modulate this NOXs activity to protect neural cells. Undifferentiated PC12 cells were treated with HG (140 mM/24 h) in the presence and absence of Atorvastatin (1 μM/96 h). The cell viability was measured by MTT assay and the gene and protein expressions profile of NOX (1–4) were determined by RT-PCR and western blotting, respectively. Levels of ROS and malondialdehyde (MDA) were also evaluated. Gene and protein expression levels of NOX (1–4) and consequently ROS and MDA levels were elevated in HG-treated PC12 cells. Atorvastatin could significantly decrease HG-induced NOXs, ROS and MDA elevation and improve impaired cell viability. It can be concluded that HG could elevate NOXs activity, ROS and MDA levels in neural tissues and Atorvastatin as a small molecule NOX inhibitor drug may prevent and delay diabetic complications, particularly neuropathy.","Rayegan, Samira; Dehpour, Ahmad Reza; Sharifi, Ali Mohammad",Metab Brain Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7102122/,450

All samples were collected during the influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 post-pandemic period 2010–11 and a sufficient number of severe and fatal cases was included.

Our findings suggest a relationship between the two complement-related SNPs, namely, the rare TT genotype of CD55 and the rare AA genotype of C1QBP with increased death risk. No significant differences were observed for FCGR2A genotypes neither with fatality nor disease severity. Additional large-scale genetic association studies are necessary for the identification of reliable host genetic risk factors associated with influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 outcome.

The resulting dynamics is extremely rich including limit cycles and random phase switching. We derive a unifying mean-field theory. Specifically, we analytically show that the critical behavior of systems whose dynamics is governed by processes (i)–(iii) can only exhibit three distinct regimes: (a) uncorrelated spontaneous transition dynamics, (b) contact process dynamics, and (c) cusp catastrophes.

METHODS: This retrospective, observational study was conducted in a tertiary care hospital's pediatric intensive care unit. Thirty-four children with pediatric acute respiratory distress syndrome (PARDS) managed with HFOV were included. RESULTS: Of 34 children with PARDS managed with HFOV after failure of conventional ventilation to improve oxygenation, 8 survived. Improvement in the Oxygenation Index (OI) at 48 h of initiation of HFOV along with percent increase in PaO(2)/FiO(2) (P/F ratio) at 24 h of HFOV were predictors of survival. The response to HFOV, based on OI and P/F ratio, between 24 and 48 h of ventilation identified potential survivors. Also, lower positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) on CMV and shorter duration of CMV before initiation of HFOV were associated with survival. CONCLUSIONS: Survival in pediatric ARDS patients treated with HFOV could be predicted by using trends of OI – with survivors showing a more rapid decline in OI between 24 and 48 h of initiation compared to non-survivors.","Chattopadhyay, Arpita; Gupta, Samriti; Sankar, Jhuma; Kabra, Sushil K.; Lodha, Rakesh",Indian J Pediatr,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7222899/,450

However, there is a lack of data that describe the scope of practice of neurointensivists and epidemiological data on the types of patients and treatments used in neurocritical care units worldwide. To address these issues, we designed a multicenter, international, point-prevalence, cross-sectional, prospective, observational, non-interventional study in the setting of neurocritical care (PRINCE Study). METHODS: In this manuscript, we analyzed data from the initial phase of the study that included registration, hospital, and intensive care unit (ICU) organizations. We present here descriptive statistics to summarize data from the registration case report form. We performed the Kruskal–Wallis test followed by the Dunn procedure to test for differences in practices among world regions. RESULTS: We analyzed information submitted by 257 participating sites from 47 countries. The majority of those sites, 119 (46.3%), were in North America, 44 (17.2%) in Europe, 34 (13.3%) in Asia, 9 (3.5%) in the Middle East, 34 (13.3%) in Latin America, and 14 (5.5%) in Oceania. Most ICUs are from academic institutions (73.4%) located in large urban centers (44% > 1 million inhabitants). We found significant differences in hospital and ICU organization, resource allocation, and use of patient management protocols. The highest nursing/patient ratio was in Oceania (100% 1:1). Dedicated Advanced Practiced Providers are mostly present in North America (73.7%) and are uncommon in Oceania (7.7%) and the Middle East (0%). The presence of dedicated respiratory therapist is common in North America (85%), Middle East (85%), and Latin America (84%) but less common in Europe (26%) and Oceania (7.7%). The presence of dedicated pharmacist is highest in North America (89%) and Oceania (85%) and least common in Latin America (38%).

13234,Mitteilungen der DGRh - Veranstaltungen der Rheumaakademie,2020-10-12,"BACKGROUND: West Virginia is a largely rural state with strong ties of kinship, mutual systems of support and charitable giving. At the same time, wealth inequalities are extreme and the state’s drug overdose fatality rate stands above all others in the USA at 51.5/100,000 in 2018, largely opioid-related. In recent years, harm reduction services have been active in the state but in 2018 Charleston’s needle and syringe program was forced to close. This paper considers the risk environment in which the state’s drug-related loss of life, and those attempting to prevent it, exist. METHODS: This rapid ethnographic study involved semi-structured interviews (n = 21), observation and video recordings of injection sequences (n = 5), initially recruiting people who inject heroin/fentanyl (PWIH) at the Charleston needle and syringe program. Snowball sampling led the research team to surrounding towns in southern West Virginia. Telephone interviews (n = 2) with individuals involved in service provision were also carried out. RESULTS: PWIH in southern West Virginia described an often unsupportive, at times hostile risk environment that may increase the risk of overdose fatalities. Negative experiences, including from some emergency responders, and fears of punitive legal consequences from calling these services may deter PWIH from seeking essential help. Compassion fatigue and burnout may play a part in this, along with resentment regarding high demands placed by the overdose crisis on impoverished state resources. We also found low levels of knowledge about safe injection practices among PWIH. CONCLUSIONS: Hostility faced by PWIH may increase their risk of overdose fatalities, injection-related injury and the risk of HIV and hepatitis C transmission by deterring help-seeking and limiting the range of harm reduction services provided locally. Greater provision of overdose prevention education and naloxone for peer distribution could help PWIH to reverse overdoses while alleviating the burden on emergency services. Although essential for reducing mortality, measures that address drug use alone are not enough to safeguard longer-term public health. The new wave of psychostimulant-related deaths underline the urgency of addressing the deeper causes that feed high-risk patterns of drug use beyond drugs and drug use.","Ondocsin, Jeff; Mars, Sarah G.; Howe, Mary; Ciccarone, Daniel",Harm Reduct J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7549084/,450

Depending on the learning technique used, such label noise is potentially harmful, requiring an increased size of the training set, making the trained model more complex and more prone to overfitting and yielding less accurate prediction. This work proposes a cleaning technique called the ensemble method based on the noise detection metric (ENDM). From the corrupted training set, an ensemble classifier is first learned and used to derive four metrics assessing the likelihood for a sample to be mislabeled. For each metric, three thresholds are set to maximize the classifying performance on a corrupted validation dataset when using three different ensemble classifiers, namely Bagging, AdaBoost and k-nearest neighbor (k-NN). These thresholds are used to identify and then either remove or correct the corrupted samples. The effectiveness of the ENDM is demonstrated in performing the classification of 15 public datasets. A comparative analysis is conducted concerning the homogeneous-ensembles-based majority vote method and consensus vote method, two popular ensemble-based label noise filters.","Feng, Wei; Quan, Yinghui; Dauphin, Gabriel",Sensors (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7727820/,450

For example, TPC2(-/-) mice show defects in cholesterol degradation, leading to hypercholesterinemia; TPC2 absence also results in mature-onset obesity, and a role in glucagon secretion and diabetes has been proposed. Infections with bacterial toxins or viruses e.g., cholera toxin or Ebola virus result in reduced infectivity rates in the absence of TPC2 or after pharmacological blockage, and TPC2(-/-) cancer cells lose their ability to migrate and metastasize efficiently. Finally, melanin production is affected by changes in hTPC2 activity, resulting in pigmentation defects and hair color variation. Here, we analyzed several publicly available genome variation data sets and identified multiple variations in the TPC2 protein in distinct human populations. Surprisingly, one variation, L564P, was found to be the predominant TPC2 isoform on a global scale. By applying endo-lysosomal patch-clamp electrophysiology, we found that L564P is a prerequisite for the previously described M484L gain-of-function effect that is associated with blond hair. Additionally, other gain-of-function variants with distinct geographical and ethnic distribution were discovered and functionally characterized. A meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies was performed, finding the polymorphisms to be associated with both distinct and overlapping traits. In sum, we present the first systematic analysis of variations in TPC2. We functionally characterized the most common variations and assessed their association with various disease traits. With TPC2 emerging as a novel drug target for the treatment of various diseases, this study provides valuable insights into ethnic and geographical distribution of TPC2 polymorphisms and their effects on channel activity.","Böck, Julia; Krogsaeter, Einar; Passon, Marcel; Chao, Yu-Kai; Sharma, Sapna; Grallert, Harald; Peters, Annette; Grimm, Christian",PLoS Genet,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7845996/,450

However, the prediction of stroke occurrences is difficult depending on only meteorological and calendar factors. We tried to make prediction models for stroke occurrences using deep learning (DL) software, Prediction One (Sony Network Communications Inc., Tokyo, Japan), with those variables. METHODS: We retrospectively investigated the daily stroke occurrences between 2017 and 2019. We used Prediction One software to make the prediction models for daily stroke occurrences (present or absent) using 221 chronologically meteorological and calendar factors. We made a prediction models from the 3-year dataset and evaluated their accuracies using the internal cross-validation. Areas under the curves (AUCs) of receiver operating characteristic curves were used as accuracies. RESULTS: The 371 cerebral infarction (CI), 184 intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), and 53 subarachnoid hemorrhage patients were included in the study. The AUCs of the several DL-based prediction models for all stroke occurrences were 0.532–0.757. Those for CI were 0.600–0.782. Those for ICH were 0.714–0.988. CONCLUSION: Our preliminary results suggested a probability of the DL-based prediction models for stroke occurrence only by meteorological and calendar factors. In the future, by synchronizing a variety of medical information among the electronic medical records and personal smartphones as well as integrating the physical activities or meteorological conditions in real time, the prediction of stroke occurrence could be performed with high accuracy, to save medical resources, to have patients care for themselves, and to perform efficient medicine.","Katsuki, Masahito; Narita, Norio; Ishida, Naoya; Watanabe, Ohmi; Cai, Siqi; Ozaki, Dan; Sato, Yoshimichi; Kato, Yuya; Jia, Wenting; Nishizawa, Taketo; Kochi, Ryuzaburo; Sato, Kanako; Tominaga, Teiji",Surg Neurol Int,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7881509/,450

In this regard, nanotechnology has a strong potential for both the diagnosis and therapy of UTIs via controlled delivery of antimicrobials upon stable, effective and sustained drug release. On one side, nanoscience allowed the production of various nanomaterial-based evaluation tools as precise, effective, and rapid procedures for the identification of UTIs. On the other side, nanotechnology brought tremendous breakthroughs for the treatment of UTIs based on the use of metallic nanoparticles (NPs) for instance, owing to the antimicrobial properties of metals, or of surface-tailored nanocarriers, allowing to overcome multidrug-resistance and prevent biofilm formation via targeted drug delivery to desired sites of action and preventing the development of cytotoxic processes in healthy cells. The goal of the current study is therefore to present the newest developments for the diagnosis and treatment of UTIs based on nanotechnology procedures in relation to the currently available techniques.","Qindeel, Maimoona; Barani, Mahmood; Rahdar, Abbas; Arshad, Rabia; Cucchiarini, Magali",Nanomaterials (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7926703/,450

In EHEC pathogenesis, the disturbance of the kidney epithelium by Stx becomes increasingly recognised, but how this exactly occurs is unknown. To explore this molecularly, we investigated the Stx receptor content and transcriptomic profile of two human renal epithelial cell lines: highly Stx-sensitive ACHN cells and largely Stx-insensitive Caki-2 cells. Though both lines exhibited the Stx receptor globotriaosylceramide, RNAseq revealed strikingly different transcriptomic responses to an Stx challenge. Using RNAi to silence factors involved in ACHN cells’ Stx response, the greatest protection occurred when silencing RAB5A and TRAPPC6B, two host factors that we newly link to Stx trafficking. Silencing these factors alongside YKT6 fully prevented the cytotoxic Stx effect. Overall, our approach reveals novel subcellular targets for potential therapies against Stx-mediated kidney failure.","Kouzel, Ivan U.; Kehl, Alexander; Berger, Petya; Liashkovich, Ivan; Steil, Daniel; Makalowski, Wojciech; Suzuki, Yutaka; Pohlentz, Gottfried; Karch, Helge; Mellmann, Alexander; Müthing, Johannes",Sci Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7080763/,450

The study evaluated the rationality of this technique and demonstrated the direction of future research by collecting data on previous operative outcomes and complications. A literature search was performed in Pubmed and Web of Science, including the following keywords and abbreviations: anterior lumbar interbody fusion (ALIF), lateral lumbar interbody fusion (LLIF), direct lateral interbody fusion (DLIF), extreme lateral interbody fusion (XLIF), oblique lateral interbody fusion (OLIF), adjacent segment disease (ASD), and adult degenerative scoliosis (ADS). A search of literature published from January 2005 to January 2019 was conducted and all studies evaluating development and application of OLIF were included in the review. According to the literature, the indications for OLIF are various. OLIF has excellent orthopaedic effects in degenerative scoliosis patients and the incidence of bony fusion is higher than for other approaches. It also provides a better choice for revision surgery. It has various advantages in many aspects, but the complications cannot be ignored. As a new minimally invasive technique, the advantages of OLIF are obvious, but further evaluation is needed to compare its operation‐related data with that of traditional open surgery. In addition, more prospective studies are required to compare minimally invasive and open spinal surgery to confirm its specific efficacy, risk, advantages, learning curve, and ultimate clinical efficacy.","Li, Renjie; Li, Xuefeng; Zhou, Hong; Jiang, Weimin",Orthop Surg,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7967883/,450
16543,Aktuelle ethische Aspekte in der Intensivmedizin,2021-04-01,"BACKGROUND: Evaluation of patients`satisfaction towards pharmacy services is of utmost importance to ensure the quality of care. It helps in identifying domains requiring improvements to provide high quality pharmacy services to ensure the provision of enhanced pharmaceutical care. The current study aims to ascertain the extent of satisfaction towards pharmacy services among patients attending outpatient pharmacies in Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. METHODS: A hospital-based cross-sectional study involving 746 patients attending outpatient pharmacies of various public hospitals was conducted from 01 January to 15 February 2020. Information on socio-demographic profile of the study subjects along with their satisfaction towards outpatient pharmacy was extracted by using a 23-items questionnaire. These questions were divided into two domains including 7 questions related to the pharmacy facilities (questions from 1F to 7F) and 8 questions for pharmacy services (questions from 1S to 8S), where F and S denotes facilities and services, respectively. The cumulative satisfaction score was estimated by a 5-item Likert scale with a maximum score of 5 for each item. The relationship between demographics and satisfaction scores was evaluated by using appropriate statistics. RESULTS: There were 746 patients with male preponderance (58.8%). The overall satisfaction score was 2.97 ± 0.65. Satisfaction towards pharmacy services scored lower (mean score: 3.91 ± 0.77) than pharmacy facilities (mean score: 4.03 ± 0.66). Items related to patient`s counseling (3F, 2S, 3S, 6S) scored least during the analysis. Older patients (p = 0.006), male gender (p<0.001), Saudi nationality (0.035), patients attending primary care centers (p = 0.02), and patients with chronic illnesses were significantly associated with lower satisfaction score. CONCLUSION: This study reported that the satisfaction level of patients attending outpatient pharmacies was low and differed among various socio-demographic groups. Approximately one-half of the patients were not satisfied with outpatient pharmacy services. These findings underscore the dire need for managerial interventions including the hiring of trained professionals, onsite training of pharmacy staff, initiation of clinical or patient centered pharmacy services, evaluation of patient`s response towards the services and appropriate controlling measures, irrespective to the type of hospitals.","Alotaibi, Nasser Hadal; Alzarea, Abdulaziz Ibrahim; Alotaibi, Ahmed Mohammed; Khan, Yusra Habib; Mallhi, Tauqeer Hussain; Alharbi, Khalid Saad; Alruwaili, Nabil K.; Alanazi, Abdullah S.; Hassan, Ahmed; Alotaib, Badriyah Shadid",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8016244/,450
17225,Evidenzbasierung: Theoriebildung und praktische Umsetzung in Prävention und Gesundheitsförderung,2021-04-30,"INTRODUCTION: Sexual harassment is a ubiquitous problem that prevents women’s integration and retention in the workforce. Its prevalence had been documented in previous health sector studies in Uganda, indicating that it affected staffing shortages and absenteeism but was largely unreported. To respond, the Ministry of Health needed in-depth information on its employees’ experiences of sexual harassment and non-reporting. METHODS: Original descriptive research was conducted in 2017 to identify the nature, contributors, dynamics and consequences of sexual harassment in public health sector workplaces and assess these in relation to available theories. Multiple qualitative techniques were employed to describe experiences of workplace sexual harassment in health employees’ own voices. Initial data collection involved document reviews to understand the policy environment, same-sex focus group discussions, key informant interviews and baseline documentation. A second phase included mixed-sex focus group discussions, in-depth interviews and follow up key informant interviews to deepen and confirm understandings. RESULTS: A pattern emerged of men in higher-status positions abusing power to coerce sex from female employees throughout the employment cycle. Rewards and sanctions were levied through informal management/ supervision practices requiring compliance with sexual demands or work-related reprisals for refusal. Abuse of organizational power reinforced vertical segregation, impeded women’s productive work and abridged their professional opportunities. Unwanted sexual attention including non-consensual touching, bullying and objectification added to distress. Gender harassment which included verbal abuse, insults and intimidation, with real or threatened retaliation, victim-blaming and gaslighting in the absence of organizational regulatory mechanisms all suppressed reporting. Sexual harassment and abuse of patients by employees emerged inadvertently. DISCUSSION/CONCLUSIONS: Sex-based harassment was pervasive in Ugandan public health workplaces, corrupted management practices, silenced reporting and undermined the achievement of human resources goals, possibilities overlooked in technical discussions of support supervision and performance management. Harassment of both health system patients and employees appeared normative and similar to “sextortion.” The mutually reinforcing intersections of sex-based harassment and vertical occupational segregation are related obstacles experienced by women seeking leadership positions. Health systems leaders should seek organizational and sectoral solutions to end sex-based harassment and make gender equality a human resource for health policy priority.

LASI-DAD obtained clinical consensus diagnosis of dementia for a subsample of 2528 respondents. OBJECTIVE: This study develops a machine learning model that uses data from the clinical consensus diagnosis in LASI-DAD to support the classification of dementia status. METHODS: Clinicians were presented with the extensive data collected from LASI-DAD, including sociodemographic information and health history of respondents, results from the screening tests of cognitive status, and information obtained from informant interviews. Based on the Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) and using an online platform, clinicians individually evaluated each case and then reached a consensus diagnosis. A 2-step procedure was implemented to train several candidate machine learning models, which were evaluated using a separate test set for predictive accuracy measurement, including the area under receiver operating curve (AUROC), accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, precision, F1 score, and kappa statistic. The ultimate model was selected based on overall agreement as measured by kappa. We further examined the overall accuracy and agreement with the final consensus diagnoses between the selected machine learning model and individual clinicians who participated in the clinical consensus diagnostic process. Finally, we applied the selected model to a subgroup of LASI-DAD participants for whom the clinical consensus diagnosis was not obtained to predict their dementia status. RESULTS: Among the 2528 individuals who received clinical consensus diagnosis, 192 (6.7% after adjusting for sampling weight) were diagnosed with dementia. All candidate machine learning models achieved outstanding discriminative ability, as indicated by AUROC >.90, and had similar accuracy and specificity (both around 0.95). The support vector machine model outperformed other models with the highest sensitivity (0.81), F1 score (0.72), and kappa (.70, indicating substantial agreement) and the second highest precision (0.65). As a result, the support vector machine was selected as the ultimate model. Further examination revealed that overall accuracy and agreement were similar between the selected model and individual clinicians. Application of the prediction model on 1568 individuals without clinical consensus diagnosis classified 127 individuals as living with dementia. After applying sampling weight, we can estimate the prevalence of dementia in the population as 7.4%. CONCLUSIONS: The selected machine learning model has outstanding discriminative ability and substantial agreement with a clinical consensus diagnosis of dementia. The model can serve as a computer model of the clinical knowledge and experience encoded in the clinical consensus diagnostic process and has many potential applications, including predicting missed dementia diagnoses and serving as a clinical decision support tool or virtual rater to assist diagnosis of dementia.","Jin, Haomiao; Chien, Sandy; Meijer, Erik; Khobragade, Pranali; Lee, Jinkook",JMIR Ment Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8145077/,450
18132,Lernen für die Prävention: Alkoholkonsum aus verschiedenen Perspektiven und in unterschiedlichen Bevölkerungsgruppen und Settings,2021-06-08,"BACKGROUND: With advances in science and technology, biotechnology is becoming more accessible to people of all demographics. These advances inevitably hold the promise to improve personal and population well-being and welfare substantially. It is paradoxical that while greater access to biotechnology on a population level has many advantages, it may also increase the likelihood and frequency of biodisasters due to accidental or malicious use. Similar to “Disease X” (describing unknown naturally emerging pathogenic diseases with a pandemic potential), we term this unknown risk from biotechnologies “Biodisaster X.” To date, no studies have examined the potential role of information technologies in preventing and mitigating Biodisaster X. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to explore (1) what Biodisaster X might entail and (2) solutions that use artificial intelligence (AI) and emerging 6G technologies to help monitor and manage Biodisaster X threats. METHODS: A review of the literature on applying AI and 6G technologies for monitoring and managing biodisasters was conducted on PubMed, using articles published from database inception through to November 16, 2020. RESULTS: Our findings show that Biodisaster X has the potential to upend lives and livelihoods and destroy economies, essentially posing a looming risk for civilizations worldwide. To shed light on Biodisaster X threats, we detailed effective AI and 6G-enabled strategies, ranging from natural language processing to deep learning–based image analysis to address issues ranging from early Biodisaster X detection (eg, identification of suspicious behaviors), remote design and development of pharmaceuticals (eg, treatment development), and public health interventions (eg, reactive shelter-at-home mandate enforcement), as well as disaster recovery (eg, sentiment analysis of social media posts to shed light on the public’s feelings and readiness for recovery building). CONCLUSIONS: Biodisaster X is a looming but avoidable catastrophe. Considering the potential human and economic consequences Biodisaster X could cause, actions that can effectively monitor and manage Biodisaster X threats must be taken promptly and proactively. Rather than solely depending on overstretched professional attention of health experts and government officials, it is perhaps more cost-effective and practical to deploy technology-based solutions to prevent and control Biodisaster X threats. This study discusses what Biodisaster X could entail and emphasizes the importance of monitoring and managing Biodisaster X threats by AI techniques and 6G technologies. Future studies could explore how the convergence of AI and 6G systems may further advance the preparedness for high-impact, less likely events beyond Biodisaster X.","Su, Zhaohui; McDonnell, Dean; Bentley, Barry L; He, Jiguang; Shi, Feng; Cheshmehzangi, Ali; Ahmad, Junaid; Jia, Peng",J Med Internet Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8153034/,450
20307,Antikoagulation in der Intensivmedizin,2021-08-25,"SIMPLE SUMMARY: We evaluated differences in avian influenza H5 Hemagglutinin (HA) tissue binding across age groups using recombinant H5 HA (rHA) proteins. Gene sequences from low pathogenic (LPAIV) (A/mallard/MN/410/2000(H5N2) and an a high pathogenic (HPAIV) (A/Northern pintail/Washington/40964/2014(H5N2)) influenza A virus (IAV) were used to generate the rHA proteins. Respiratory and intestinal tracts from chickens, ducks (Mallard, Pekin, Muscovy), and turkeys of different age groups were used to detect rHA binding with protein histochemistry, which was quantified as the median area of binding (MAB) for statistical analysis. Turkeys had significant differences in the HPAIV rHA binding in the respiratory tract, with younger turkeys having higher levels of binding in the lung compared to the older group. In the intestinal tract, younger turkeys had higher levels of binding compared to the older birds. Using LPAIV, only turkeys had overall significant differences in the respiratory tract MAB, with the older birds having higher levels of binding compared to the younger group. We saw no age-related differences in the overall intestinal tract rHA binding. Age-related differences in rHA binding of the LPAIV and HPAIV rHA demonstrated in this study may partially, but not completely, explain differences in host susceptibility to infection observed during avian influenza outbreaks and in experimental infection studies. ABSTRACT: The 2014 outbreak of clade 2.3.4.4A highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) led to the culling of millions of commercial chickens and turkeys and death of various wild bird species. In this outbreak, older chickens and turkeys were commonly infected, and succumbed to clinical disease compared to younger aged birds such chicken broilers. Some experimental studies using waterfowl species have shown age-related differences in susceptibility to clinical disease with HPAI viruses. Here, we evaluate differences in H5 Hemagglutinin (HA) tissue binding across age groups, using recombinant H5 HA (rHA) proteins generated using gene sequences from low pathogenic (A/mallard/MN/410/2000(H5N2 (LPAIV)) and a HPAIV (A/Northern pintail/Washington/40964/2014(H5N2)) influenza A virus (IAV). Respiratory and intestinal tracts from chickens, ducks (Mallard, Pekin, Muscovy) and turkeys of different age groups were used to detect rHA binding with protein histochemistry, which was quantified as the median area of binding (MAB) used for statistical analysis. There were species and tissue specific differences in the rHA binding among the age groups; however, turkeys had significant differences in the HPAIV rHA binding in the respiratory tract, with younger turkeys having higher levels of binding in the lung compared to the older group. In addition, in the intestinal tract, younger turkeys had higher levels of binding compared to the older birds. Using LPAIV, similar species and tissues, specific differences were seen among the age groups; however, only turkeys had overall significant differences in the respiratory tract MAB, with the older birds having higher levels of binding compared to the younger group. No age-related differences were seen in the overall intestinal tract rHA binding. Age-related differences in rHA binding of the LPAIV and HPAIV demonstrated in this study may partially, but not completely, explain differences in host susceptibility to infection observed during avian influenza outbreaks and in experimental infection studies.","Jerry, Carmen; Stallknecht, David E.; Leyson, Christina; Berghaus, Roy; Jordan, Brian; Pantin-Jackwood, Mary; França, Monique S.",Animals (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8388419/,450

OBJECTIVE: To determine how patients with esophageal cancer are diagnosed and treated in Ontario’s regionalized thoracic surgery centers. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cohort study included patients diagnosed with esophageal cancer between January 1, 2010, and December 31, 2018, identified from the Ontario Cancer Registry, in a single-payer health care system with regionalization of thoracic surgery in the province of Ontario, Canada. EXPOSURES: Exposures included incidence of esophageal cancer and stage at diagnosis; time from the first health care visit until treatment; and the use of specialist consultations, endoscopic ultrasonography, positron emission tomography and computed tomography, endomucosal resection, esophagectomy, neoadjuvant therapy, adjuvant therapy, radiation alone, and chemotherapy alone or in combination with other treatment. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Outcome measures included wait times, health care use, treatment, and overall survival. Data were analyzed from March 2020 to February 2021. RESULTS: There were 10 364 patients (mean [SD] age, 68.3 [11.9] years; 7876 men [76%]) identified during the study period. The incidence of esophageal cancer increased over the study period from 1041 in 2010 to 1309 in 2018, which was driven by a 30% increase in the number of adenocarcinomas. The time from first health care encounter to start of treatment was a median 93 days (interquartile range, 56-159 days). Endoscopic ultrasonography was observed for 12% of patients, and positron emission tomography and computed tomography (CT) in 45%. Use of endoscopic mucosal resection was observed for 8% of patients with stage 0 to I disease. A total of 114 of 547 patients (21%) receiving endoscopic resection had a subsequent esophagectomy. Only 2778 patients (27%) had consultations with a thoracic surgeon, a medical oncologist, and a radiation oncologist, whereas 1514 patients (15%) did not see any of these specialists. Of 3047 patients who had an esophagectomy, those receiving neoadjuvant therapy had better overall survival (median survival, 36 months; 95% CI, 32-39 months) than patients who received esophagectomy alone (median survival, 27 months; 95% CI, 24-30 months) or those who received esophagectomy with adjuvant therapy (median survival, 36 months; 95% CI, 32-44 months) despite significant early mortality (log-rank P < .001). There was significant variation in treatment modality across hospitals: esophagectomy ranged from 5% to 39%; esophagectomy after neoadjuvant therapy ranged from 33% to 93%; and esophagectomy followed by adjuvant therapy ranged from 0 to 34% (P < .001). Perioperative mortality was higher at 30 days for patients receiving esophagectomy at low-volume centers (odds ratio [OR], 3.66; 95% CI, 2.01-6.66) and medium-volume centers (OR, 2.07; 95% CI, 1.33-3.23) compared with high-volume centers (P < .001). A longer wait time until treatment was associated with better overall survival (median overall survival was 15 to 17 days vs 5 to 8 days for patients who received treatment earlier than 30 days vs 30 days or longer after diagnosis; P < .001). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The results of this cohort study suggest that despite regionalization, there was significant regional variability in volumes at designated centers and in the evaluation and treatment course for patients with esophageal cancer across Ontario.","Habbous, Steven; Yermakhanova, Olga; Forster, Katharina; Holloway, Claire M.

This study investigated differences in the research programs of academic and non-academic trauma centers. METHODS: A 28-question survey was administered to ACS-verified level I trauma centers in 11/12/2020–1/7/2021. The survey included questions on center characteristics (patient volume, staff size), peer-reviewed publications, staff and resources dedicated to research, and funding sources. RESULTS: The survey had a 31% response rate: 137 invitations were successfully delivered via email, and 42 centers completed at least part of the survey. Responding level I trauma centers included 36 (86%) self-identified academic and 6 (14%) self-identified non-academic centers. Academic and non-academic centers reported similar annual trauma patient volume (2190 vs. 2450), number of beds (545 vs. 440), and years of ACS verification (20 vs. 14), respectively. Academic centers had more full-time trauma surgeons (median 8 vs 6 for non-academic centers) and general surgery residents (median 30 vs 7) than non-academic centers. Non-academic centers more frequently ranked trauma surgery (100% vs. 36% academic), basic science (50% vs. 6% academic), neurosurgery (50% vs. 14% academic), and nursing (33% vs. 0% academic) in the top three types of studies conducted. Academic centers were more likely to report non-profit status (86% academic, 50% non-academic) and utilized research funding from external governmental or non-profit grants more often (76% vs 17%). CONCLUSIONS: Survey results suggest that academic centers may have more physician, resident, and financial resources available to dedicate to trauma research, which may make fulfillment of ACS level I research requirements easier. Structural and institutional changes at non-academic centers, such as expansion of general surgery resident programs and increased pursuit of external grant funding, may help ensure that academic and non-academic sites are equally equipped to fulfill ACS research criteria.

Gemeinsamen Jahrestagung der DGIIN und ÖGIAIN,2013-05-15,"Virology is a branch of biological science dealing with the study of viruses, and medical virology focuses on the study and control of diseases due to viruses that is of medical importance. The development of medical virology in Malaysia has its beginning in the Institute for Medical Research (IMR), following the establishment of the Division of Medical Zoology and Virus Research in the institute on 23 March 1953. The second institution in the country to establish diagnostic and research work in medical virology was Department of Medical Microbiology, Faculty of Medicine, University Malaya. This was followed by University Kebangsaan Malaysia, University Sains Malaysia and University of Sarawak Malaysia. The National Public Health Laboratory (NPHL) is the latest institution to establish a laboratory in 2003 for virus isolation and services to support country surveillance and outbreak investigation of infectious diseases due to viruses. In the field of medical virology, Malaysia contributed substantially in the areas of virus diagnostic services, development and research ranging from survey and documentation on the existence and prevalence of viruses causing diseases in Malaysia, clinical presentation and epidemiological features of virus diseases, evaluation of new diagnostic tests to pathogenesis of viral diseases. Malaysia contributed to the discoveries of at least 12 new viruses in the world. ASEAN plus Three (China, Japan, Republic of Korea) Emerging Infectious Programme was established to overcome the challenges and impact of emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases in this region. Malaysia as the co-ordinator of the laboratory component of the programme, contributed to strengthen the regional laboratory capability, capacity, laboratory-based surveillance and networking. The future of medical virology in Malaysia in terms of integration of diagnostic, reference and research to support the country’s need will be enhanced and strengthened with the on-going development of the National Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC Malaysia) which also incorporates a futuristic Special Diagnostic and Reference Laboratory.","Chua, Kaw Bing",Virol Sin,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7091434/,450

Juni 2016 in Berlin, Estrel Berlin",2016-05-04,"Poultry production is an important economic activity on inhabited islands of the Galápagos archipelago. There has been a recent surge in both small-scale backyard chickens and larger scale broiler production associated with growth in the human population and the tourist industry. With increased poultry production, concerns have been expressed about the increasing risk of transfer of disease from chickens to native Galápagos bird species that may have little resistance to introduced pathogens [Wikelski, M., Foufopoulos, J., Vargas, H., Snell, H., 2004. Galápagos birds and diseases: invasive pathogens as threats for island species. Ecology and Society 9(5). Available from: URL:http://www.ecologyandsociety.org/vol9/iss1/art5]. This study evaluates risks posed by chicken disease to endemic and native Galápagos bird species, based on empirical evidence of pathogens present in chickens on the islands and a literature review of effects of these pathogens in wild species. Pathogens identified in domestic chicken populations of immediate avian conservation concern are Newcastle disease, Mycoplasma gallisepticum, and the proventricular parasite Dispharynx sp. Newcastle disease (avian paramyxovirus-1) poses an imminent threat to Galápagos penguins (Spheniscus mendiculus), flightless cormorants (Phalacrocorax harrisi), and lava gulls (Larus fuliginosus), species with very small population sizes (less than 1500 animals each). Additionally, litter from broiler farms could affect ecological processes in local ecosystems. Improved poultry biosecurity measures are urgently needed on the Galápagos Islands for avian disease management, yet developing these strategies presents political, social, and economic challenges.","Gottdenker, Nicole L.; Walsh, Timothy; Vargas, Hernan; Merkel, Jane; Jiménez, Gustavo U.; Miller, R.

Since the reaction products often contain mixtures of multiple chemical species, subsequent analytical steps must be capable of separating and identifying the individual components. Electrophoresis, which relies on inducing detectable differences in migration behavior between charged species under the influence of an applied electric field, has proven to be a highly versatile analytical technique owing to a favorable combination of characteristics including relatively simple hardware design and compatibility with a wide range of analytes including biological macromolecules (e.g., DNA, proteins). More recently, there has been considerable interest in adapting electrophoresis technology to miniaturized microfluidic formats with the aim of producing portable low-cost versions of conventional benchtop-scale instrumentation. Ultimately, it is envisioned that these efforts will enable electrophoresis to become an integral component of self-contained “lab-on-a-chip” devices capable of putting the power to perform a variety of sophisticated chemical, biological, and biomedical assays directly in the hands of those who need the information most.","Ugaz, Victor M.; Christensen, Jennifer L.",Microfluidic Technologies for Miniaturized Analysis Systems,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7114973/,450

Novel pharmacological approaches to ameliorate the lack of active CFTR in respiratory epithelial cells are beginning to address more of the pathophysiological defects caused by CFTR mutations. However, CFTR gene replacement by gene therapy remains the most likely option for addressing the basic defects, including ion transport and inflammatory functions of CFTR.

Viral based vaccines must also deal with the potential problem of the pre-existing antivector immunity. Several viral vaccine vectors have emerged to date, all of them having relative advantages and limits depending on the proposed application. Recent successes reflect diverse improvements such as development of new adenovirus serotypes and prime-boost regimes.

24922,Die Diagnose der Sepsis,2006,"The term interstitial lung diseases (ILD) comprises a diverse group of diseases that lead to inflammation and fibrosis of the alveoli, distal airways, and septal interstitium of the lungs. The ILD consist of disorders of known cause (e.g., collagen vascular diseases, drug-related diseases) as well as disorders of unknown etiology. The latter include idiopathic interstitial pneumonias (IIPs), and a group of miscellaneous, rare, but nonetheless interesting, diseases. In patients with ILD, MDCT enriches the diagnostic armamentarium by allowing volumetric high-resolution scanning, i.e., continuous data acquisition with thin collimation and a high spatial frequency reconstruction algorithm. CT is a key method in the identification and management of patients with ILD. It not only improves the detection and characterization of parenchymal abnormalities, but also increases the accuracy of diagnosis. The spectrum of morphologic characteristics that are indicative of interstitial lung disease is relatively limited and includes the linear and reticular pattern, the nodular pattern, the increased attenuation pattern (such as ground-glass opacities and consolidation), and the low attenuation pattern (such as emphysema and cystic lung diseases). In the correct clinical context, some patterns or combination of patterns, together with the anatomic distribution of the abnormality, i.e., from the lung apex to the base, or peripheral subpleural versus central bronchovascular, can lead the interpreter to a specific diagnosis. However, due to an overlap of the CT morphology between the various entities, the final diagnosis of many ILD requires close cooperation between clinicians and radiologists and complementary lung biopsy is recommended in many cases.","Mueller-Mang, Christina; Ringl, Helmut; Herold, Christian",Multislice CT,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7121385/,450
25255,"Bildgebende Verfahren: Röntgen, Ultraschall, CT, Nuklearmedizin",2008,"Interferons (IFNs) are extremely powerful cytokines for the host defence against viral infections. Binding of IFNs to their receptors activates the JAK/STAT signalling pathway with the Janus kinases JAK1, 2 and TYK2 and the signal transducer and activators of transcription (STAT) 1 and STAT2. Depending on the cellular setting, additional STATs (STAT3-6) and additional signalling pathways are activated. The actions of IFNs on infected cells and the surrounding tissue are mediated by the induction of several hundred IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs). Since the cloning of the first ISGs, considerable progress has been made in describing antiviral effector proteins and their many modes of action. Effector proteins individually target distinct steps in the viral life cycle, including blocking virus entry, inhibition of viral transcription and translation, modification of viral nucleic acids and proteins and, interference with virus assembly and budding. Novel pathways of viral inhibition are constantly being elucidated and, additionally, unanticipated functions of known antiviral effector proteins are discovered. Herein, we outline IFN-induced antiviral pathways and review recent developments in this fascinating area of research.","Strobl, Birgit; Leitner, Nicole R.; Müller, Mathias",Jak-Stat Signaling : From Basics to Disease,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7121797/,450
25325,Nosokomiale Pneumonie,2017-02-01,"Septic syndromes represent a major although largely under-recognized healthcare problem worldwide accounting for thousands of deaths every year [1–3]. Mortality remains high ranging from 20 % for sepsis to over 50 % for septic shock despite almost 20 years of anti-inflammatory clinical trials [1–3]. The inability of these therapies to mitigate the devastating effects of this condition indicates that the initial hypotheses for sepsis pathophysiology may have been misconstrued or inadequately addressed. Two major explanations have been proposed: 1) Septic patients have mainly been treated as a group despite the extreme heterogeneity characterizing this population [1]; 2) The postulate that death after sepsis is solely due to an overwhelming pro-inflammatory immune response may actually be inaccurate [1, 3]. Indeed, several lines of evidence have now established that death from septic shock is probably due to the effect of distinct mechanisms over time [1–3]. Early in the course of the disease, a massive release of inflammatory mediators (normally designed to trigger an immune response against pathogens) is occurring that may be responsible for organ dysfunction and hypoperfusion [1, 3]. Concomitantly, the body develops compensatory mechanisms to prevent overwhelming inflammation and dampen an overzealous anti-infectious response [1–3]. These negative feedback mechanisms, although having protective effects during the first initial hours, may paradoxically become deleterious as they persist over time leading to immune paralysis (Fig. 1) [1, 3]. Indeed, considerable clinical and experimental evidence indicates that patients rapidly present with numerous compromised immune functions [1, 3].","Venet, F.; Lepape, A.; Monneret, G.",Intensive Care Medicine,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7121891/,450
25582,Lipidmediatoren und ihre Rolle bei Entzündungen und Allergien,2020-03-25,"Traditional vaccines such as inactivated or live attenuated vaccines, are gradually giving way to more biochemically defined vaccines that are most often based on a recombinant antigen known to possess neutralizing epitopes. Such vaccines can offer improvements in speed, safety and manufacturing process but an inevitable consequence of their high degree of purification is that immunogenicity is reduced through the lack of the innate triggering molecules present in more complex preparations. Targeting recombinant vaccines to antigen presenting cells (APCs) such as dendritic cells however can improve immunogenicity by ensuring that antigen processing is as efficient as possible. Immune complexes, one of a number of routes of APC targeting, are mimicked by a recombinant approach, crystallizable fragment (Fc) fusion proteins, in which the target immunogen is linked directly to an antibody effector domain capable of interaction with receptors, FcR, on the APC cell surface. A number of virus Fc fusion proteins have been expressed in insect cells using the baculovirus expression system and shown to be efficiently produced and purified. Their use for immunization next to non-Fc tagged equivalents shows that they are powerfully immunogenic in the absence of added adjuvant and that immune stimulation is the result of the Fc-FcR interaction.","Loureiro, Silvia; Robinson, Elena; Chen, Hongying; Phapugrangkul, Pongsathon; Colaco, Camilo; Jones, Ian M",Innovation in Vaccinology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7122206/,450

25841,Akutes und chronisches Leberversagen,2014-07-07,"Dense core granules (DCGs) are vesicular organelles derived from outbound traffic through the eukaryotic secretory pathway. As DCGs are formed, the secretory pathway can also give rise to other types of vesicles, such as those bound for endosomes, lysosomes, and the cell surface. DCGs differ from these other vesicular carriers in both content and function, storing highly concentrated cores’ of condensed cargo in vesicles that are stably maintained within the cell until a specific extracellular stimulus causes their fusion with the plasma membrane. These unique features are imparted by the activities of membrane and lumenal proteins that are specifically delivered to the vesicles during synthesis. This chapter will describe the DCG biogenesis pathway, beginning with the sorting of DCG proteins from proteins that are destined for other types of vesicle carriers. In the trans-Golgi network (TGN), sorting occurs as DCG proteins aggregate, causing physical separation from non-DCG proteins. Recent work addresses the nature of interactions that produce these aggregates, as well as potentially important interactions with membranes and membrane proteins. DCG proteins are released from the TGN in vesicles called immature secretory granules (ISGs). The mechanism of ISG formation is largely unclear but is not believed to rely on the assembly of vesicle coats like those observed in other secretory pathways. The required cytosolic factors are now beginning to be identified using in vitro systems with purified cellular components. ISG transformation into a mature fusion-competent, stimulus-dependent DCG occurs as endoproteolytic processing of many DCG proteins causes continued condensation of the lumenal contents. At the same time, proteins that fail to be incorporated into the condensing core are removed by a coat-mediated budding mechanism, which also serves to remove excess membrane and membrane proteins from the maturing vesicle. This chapter will summarize the work leading to our current view of granule synthesis, and will discuss questions that need to be addressed in order to gain a more complete understanding of the pathway.","Bowman, Grant R.; Cowan, Andrew T.; Turkewitz, Aaron P.",Trafficking Inside Cells,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7122546/,450
25867,Krankheiten des Herz-Kreislauf-Systems,2007,"Pancreatic islet transplantation has the potential to become the most physiologically advantageous and minimally invasive procedure for the treatment of type 1 diabetes mellitus. Since the first clinical islet transplantation was performed at the University of Minnesota in 1974 [1], the results have been far from ideal for more than two decades in spite of an improvement of islet isolation technique by Ricordi et al. [2–4]. The introduction of the Edmonton protocol, with a highly improved rate of insulin independency, encouraged us to promote clinical islet transplantation [5, 6]. In Japan, we organized the Working Group (The Japanese Islet Transplant Registry) in 1997 under the Japanese Society for Pancreas and Islet Transplantation for the purpose of starting clinical islet transplantation. The first issue of the Working Group was to construct a system of clinical islet transplantation in Japan including the registration of the recipients, procurement of the pancreas for islet isolation and transplantation of the isolated islets. In Japan, afterwards, various problems facing to a start of clinical islet transplantation have been discussed and we completed the guideline for clinical islet transplantation in Japan. The Japanese Organ Transplant Law was enforced in 1997 and organ transplantations using brain dead (DBD) donors were finally started. Since the islet transplantation was not included in the Japanese Organ Transplant Law because it was categorized as tissue transplantation, we were able to use the pancreas only from DCD donors for islet transplantation. The first islet isolation from the human pancreas was performed in 2003.9 and the first islet transplantation was performed in 2004.4 [7–9]. Sixty-five islet isolations and 34 islet transplantations were performed in our country from 2003.9.12 to 2007.3.11 [10].

Epidemiological studies soon recognized that HBV is a global chronic liver disease, with the highest prevalence rates in Asia and Africa. HBV is highly infectious, and in most cases transmitted from family members. Infections acquired during the perinatal period have a 90% chance of progressing to persistent HBV infection. This rate decreases to 2.3% when infection occurs at college student age. The persistent HBV infection starts with the immune tolerance phase when our immune system may recognize HBV antigens, but does not produce significant inflammation. An immune clearance reaction may develop to terminate HBV replication two to four decades later. When this immune clearance reaction successfully suppresses HBV replication, HBsAg carriers may progress to the residual phase. About 50% of HBsAg carriers ultimately clear HBsAg at age 80. Those patients unable to clear HBV replication smoothly have increased risk of chronic hepatitis, liver cirrhosis, and hepatocarcinogenesis. Current therapies decrease hepatic decompensation and increase survival rate. However, the sustained virologic response rate is lower than 40%. About 50% of patients experience a clinical flare within one year after therapy ends. Further studies will be needed to improve sustained virologic response rate.","Tai, Dar-In",Liver Diseases,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7122759/,450

This was the method of choice for more than 20 years, but more efficient protocols are now available, based on somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT) which permits targeted genetic modifications. Although the efficiency of transgenic animal production by microinjection technology is low, many animals with agriculturally important transgenic traits were produced. Typical applications included improved carcass composition, lactational performance, and wool production as well as enhanced disease resistance and reduced environmental impact. Transgenic animal production for biomedical applications has found broad acceptance. In 2006 the European Medicines Agency (EMEA) approved the commercialization of the first recombinant protein drug produced by transgenic animals. Recombinant antithrombin III, produced in the mammary gland of transgenic goats, was launched as ATryn® for prophylactic treatment of patients with congenital antithrombin deficiency. Pigs expressing human immunomodulatory genes have contributed to significant progress in xenotransplantation research with survival periods of non-human primates receiving transgenic porcine hearts or kidneys approaching six months. Lentiviral vectors and small interfering ribonucleic acid (siRNA) technology are also emerging as important tools for transgenesis.

Presumably because of their long history of coevolution, most of these viruses remain subclinical in bats, but have the potential to cause severe illnesses in domestic and wildlife animals and also humans. Spillovers from bats to humans either happen directly (via contact with infected bats) or indirectly (via intermediate hosts such as domestic or wildlife animals, by consuming food items contaminated by saliva, faeces or urine of bats, or via other environmental sources). Increasing numbers of breakouts of zoonotic viral diseases among humans and livestock have mainly been accounted to human encroachment into natural habitat, as well as agricultural intensification, deforestation and bushmeat consumption. Persecution of bats, including the destruction of their roosts and culling of whole colonies, has led not only to declines of protected bat species, but also to an increase in virus prevalence in some of these populations.

There is a high prevalence among patients with autoimmune connective tissue disorders, especially SLE. There is an association with both venous and arterial thrombosis as well as with pregnancy morbidity, but the strength of association varies amongst studies. This probably reflects different populations, study designs, and different assays and definitions used. In several studies the risk of thrombosis appears to be higher with LA and the data suggests a true association rather than epiphenomenon. In a given patient, both aCL and LA should be measured. A significant impact on long-term survival has been noted and aPL also contribute significantly to accumulated damage in diseases such as SLE.

The other two levels relate to the integration into portfolio and service catalogs. The portfolio development and the consideration of security in service catalogs (Sect. 7.4) are important for user organizations or even the next party in the internal supply chain of the ICT Service Provider.","von Faber, Eberhard; Behnsen, Wolfgang","Secure ICT Service Provisioning for Cloud, Mobile and Beyond",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7123389/,450

32300,The New Complexity Landscape Around Circuit Minimization,2020-01-07,"1.. As many invertebrates are nocturnal, their spatial distribution may change from day to night. This behavioural aspect of their population dynamics has been ignored, but is now examined for the first time by testing the hypotheses: (i) a power function was a suitable model for the spatial distribution of common species of Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera and Trichoptera in a stony stream; (ii) the spatial distribution varied between species but was similar within species for larvae greater and smaller than half‐size; (iii) diurnal and nocturnal spatial distributions were significantly different for each species. To ensure that the conclusions were consistent, large samples (n = 30) were taken near midday and midnight in April, June and November over 4 years. 2.. Twenty–one species were taken in sufficient numbers for the analyses; seven species were too sparse to be included. The first hypothesis was supported. A power function, relating spatial variance (s (2)) to mean (m), was an excellent fit in all the analyses (P < 0·001, r (2) > 0·95), i.e. the spatial variance was density–dependent. The power b, often used as an ‘index of aggregation’, varied in the range 0·88–2·50. 3.. Most analyses supported the second hypothesis. For four species, the difference between the two size groups was just significant (P < 0·05), but was due to inadequate data for three species. Large larvae of the fourth species, the caddis Odontocerum albicorne, were less aggregated than small larvae at night, and were the only group with a b‐value less than one. 4.. The third hypothesis was partially supported. The distribution did not change significantly (P > 0·05) for nine species; five burrowers in gravel, moss or mud, two highly mobile predators, one sedentary, case–building, Trichoptera species, and one net–spinning Trichoptera species. Aggregation was reduced significantly (P < 0·001) at night for four species, all case–building Trichoptera larvae. Aggregation increased significantly (P < 0·001) at night, except at low densities, for the remaining eight species, one being a nocturnal predator and the others being herbivorous species; all occurred frequently in night samples of invertebrate drift. Day–night changes in spatial distribution were therefore an essential part of the behavioural dynamics of 12 of the 21 species, and should be investigated in other species, including terrestrial species.","Elliott, J.

Physical, behavioural and physiological characteristics of the species are described in detail, based on observations in captivity. At AWWP, the Beira antelope population increased from 2000 until 2006 when it declined dramatically as a result of an epidemic‐like outbreak of a respiratory disease most likely owing to a Mycoplasma infection. Management at AWWP includes a diet based on natural forage, careful group composition, enclosure design adapted to the need of the species and close monitoring. Apart from their important conservation status, Beira antelope are highly attractive animals with a particular shape and coloration, and a docile nature.","HAMMER, C.",Int Zoo Yearb,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7202063/,450

At the same place a standardised trapping scheme is in operation. This study reveals for the first time a positive correlation between the migratory intensity of birds aloft and the numbers of trapped birds. By relating the migratory patterns of single species with the nocturnal migratory intensities, we show that the species composition aloft can at least partly be deduced from the number of grounded birds. The numbers of trapped pre‐Saharan migrants were related more strongly to the migratory intensity of the preceding night than were the numbers of trans‐Saharan migrants. Assuming that the number of trapped birds varies according to the weather to the same ­extent as the migratory intensity of birds aloft, we conclude that in shorter range migrants the decision to engage in a migratory flight is influenced more strongly by weather conditions, and that the migratory activity of trans‐Saharan migrants is possibly more intensely controlled by their endogenous migratory urge.","Zehnder, Susanna; Karlsson, Lennart",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7202361/,450

This is particularly wasteful when recurrent patterns exist. In this work, we introduce a novel framework called PEARL, which uses both an exact technique and a probabilistic graphical model with Lossy Counting, to replace drifted trees with relevant trees built from the past. The exact technique utilizes pattern matching to find the set of drifted trees, that co-occurred in predictions in the past. Meanwhile, a probabilistic graphical model is being built to capture the tree replacements among recurrent concept drifts. Once the graphical model becomes stable, it replaces the exact technique and finds relevant trees in a probabilistic fashion. Further, Lossy Counting is applied to the graphical model which brings an added theoretical guarantee for both error rate and space complexity. We empirically show our technique outperforms baselines in terms of cumulative accuracy on both synthetic and real-world datasets.","Wu, Ocean; Koh, Yun Sing; Dobbie, Gillian; Lacombe, Thomas",Advances in Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7206241/,450

We develop an analytical framework and provide numerical results for arbitrary hypergraphs, which we also support with Monte Carlo simulations. Our analyses show that the model has a vast parameter space, with first- and second-order transitions, bistability, and hysteresis. Phenomenologically, we also extend the concept of latent heat to social contexts, which might help understanding oscillatory social behaviors.

This simple deviation from the standard setup is sufficient to prove that heterogeneity in the dynamical parameters can be as important as the more studied structural heterogeneity. Our analytical solution is able to predict the shift in the critical properties induced by heterogeneous recovery rates. We find that the critical value of infectivity tends to be smaller than the one predicted by quenched mean-field approaches in the homogeneous case and that it can be linked to the variance of the recovery rates. Our findings also illustrate the role of dynamical-structural correlations, where we allow a power-law network to dynamically behave as a homogeneous structure by an appropriate tuning of its recovery rates. Overall, our results demonstrate that heterogeneity in the recovery rates, eventually in all dynamical parameters, is as important as the structural heterogeneity.","de Arruda, Guilherme Ferraz; Petri, Giovanni; Rodrigues, Francisco A.; Moreno, Yamir",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7217552/,450

Establishing an early diagnosis of M. pneumoniae pneumonia in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) may have important therapeutic implications. METHODS: We describe diagnosis and management of M. pneumoniae pneumonia induced ARDS in a case series of adults and youth hospitalized with radiographically confirmed CAP prospectively enrolled in an observational cohort study in two university teaching hospitals, from November 2017 to October 2019. RESULTS: In all 10 patients, early and rapid diagnosis for severe M. pneumoniae pneumonia with ARDS was achieved with polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) testing of samples from the lower respiratory tract or pleural effusion. The average PaO(2)/FiO(2) of all patients was 180 mmHg. Of the 10 cases, 4 cases had moderate ARDS (100 mmHg ≤ PaO(2)/FiO(2) < 200 mmHg) and 3 cases had severe ARDS (PaO(2)/FiO(2) < 100 mmHg). High flow nasal cannula (HFNC) was applied in all patients, though only two patients were sufficiently supported with HFNC. Invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) was required in 5 patients. High resistance (median 15 L/cmH(2)O/s) and low compliance (median 38 ml/cmH(2)O) was observed in 4 cases. In these 4 cases, recruitment maneuvers (RM) were applied, with 1 patient demonstrating no response to RM. Prone positioning were applied in 4 cases. Two cases needed ECMO support with median support duration of 5.5 days. No patient in our case series received corticosteroid therapy. All patients were survived and were discharged from hospital. CONCLUSIONS: Early and rapid diagnosis of severe M. pneumoniae pneumonia with ARDS can be achieved with PCR/mNGS tests in samples from the lower respiratory tract or pleural effusion. In our case series, half of M. pneumoniae pneumonia induced ARDS cases were adequately supported with HFNC or NIV, while half of cases required intubation. RM and prone position were effective in 30% of intubated cases, and 20% needed ECMO support. When early anti-mycoplasmal antibiotics were given together with sufficient respiratory support, the survival rate was high with no need for corticosteroid use.","Ding, Lin; Zhao, Yu; Li, Xuyan; Wang, Rui; Li, Ying; Tang, Xiao; Sun, Bing; He, Hangyong",BMC Infect Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7245847/,450

Such KGs build the foundation for knowledge-driven tasks e.g., link discovery, prediction and entity classification which allow to provide recommendation services. Knowledge graph embedding (KGE) models have been investigated for such knowledge-driven tasks in different application domains. One of the applications of KGE models is to provide link predictions, which can also be viewed as a foundation for recommendation service, e.g. high confidence “co-author” links in a scholarly knowledge graph can be seen as suggested collaborations. In this paper, KGEs are reconciled with a specific loss function (Soft Margin) and examined with respect to their performance for co-authorship link prediction task on scholarly KGs. The results show a significant improvement in the accuracy of the experimented KGE models on the considered scholarly KGs using this specific loss. TransE with Soft Margin (TransE-SM) obtains a score of 79.5% Hits@10 for co-authorship link prediction task while the original TransE obtains 77.2%, on the same task.

Coding (missense) and regulatory variants from TMPRSS2 and CD26 were studied across 26 global populations. Two missense and five regulatory SNPs were identified to have differential allelic frequency. Significant linkage disequilibrium (LD) signature was observed in different populations. Modelled protein‒protein interaction (PPI) predicted strong molecular interaction between these two receptors and SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (S1 domain). However, two missense SNPs, rs12329760 (TMPRSS2) and rs1129599 (CD26), were not found to be involved physically in the said interaction. Four regulatory variants (rs112657409, rs11910678, rs77675406 and rs713400) from TMPRSS2 were found to influence the expression of TMPRSS2 and pathologically relevant MX1. rs13015258 a 5′ UTR variant from CD26 have significant role in regulation of expression of key regulatory genes that could be involved in SARS-CoV-2 internalization. Overexpression of CD26 through epigenetic modification at rs13015258-C allele was found critical and could explain the higher SARS-CoV-2 infected fatality rate among type 2 diabetes.

It may seem that the probabilistic nature of ML tools would invalidate the exact results prized by such software, however, the algorithms which underpin the software often come with a range of choices which are good candidates for ML application. We refer to choices which have no effect on the mathematical correctness of the software, but do impact its performance. In the past we experimented with one such choice: the variable ordering to use when building a Cylindrical Algebraic Decomposition (CAD). We used the Python library Scikit-Learn (sklearn) to experiment with different ML models, and developed new techniques for feature generation and hyper-parameter selection. These techniques could easily be adapted for making decisions other than our immediate application of CAD variable ordering. Hence in this paper we present a software pipeline to use sklearn to pick the variable ordering for an algorithm that acts on a polynomial system. The code described is freely available online.","Florescu, Dorian; England, Matthew",Mathematical Software - ICMS 2020,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7340908/,450

In addition, we propose a verification approach to assure the validity of the synthesized interpolant and consequently avoid the unsoundness caused by numerical error in [Formula: see text] solving. Besides, we discuss how to generalize our approach to general semi-algebraic formulas.

Despite this success, major obstacles remain in developing vaccines for pathogens against which vaccines do not exist or against emerging pathogens and improving suboptimal vaccines. Key elements needed to design effective vaccines include identification of protective antigens against which a robust and durable adaptive response must be generated, compounds that can stimulate the innate immune responses, and optimal delivery systems which carry and dispense the antigenic and immuno stimulatory cargo to the appropriate cells of the immune system. The mechanistic understanding and the tools to manipulate this system are growing and it is likely that novel immune potentiators and delivery systems can make a significant impact on vaccine development in the near future. Thus, selecting the optimal platforms for development and identifying the key cellular and molecular targets of the innate immune system can trigger the safest and most effective immune responses against diverse pathogens which should be the long-term goal.","Pashine, Achal; Ulmer, Jeffrey B.; Valiante, Nicholas M.",Immunopotentiators in Modern Vaccines,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7404728/,450

Jahrestagung der Österreichischen Gesellschaft für Innere Medizin,2020-09-18,"BACKGROUND: Evidence for an autoimmune etiology in canine diabetes is inconsistent and could vary based on breed. Previous studies demonstrated that small percentages of diabetic dogs possess autoantibodies to antigens known to be important in human type 1 diabetes, but most efforts involved analysis of a wide variety of breeds. The objective of this study was to evaluate the presence of glutamic acid decarboxylase 65 (GAD65), insulinoma-associated protein 2 (IA-2), and zinc transporter 8 (ZnT8) autoantibodies in diabetic and non-diabetic Australian Terriers and Samoyeds, two breeds with comparatively high prevalence of diabetes, in the United States. RESULTS: There was no significant difference in the proportion of samples considered positive for GAD65 or ZnT8 autoantibodies in either breed evaluated, or for IA-2 autoantibodies in Australian Terriers (p > 0.05). The proportion of IA-2 autoantibody positive samples was significantly higher in diabetic versus non-diabetic Samoyeds (p = 0.003), but substantial overlap was present between diabetic and non-diabetic groups. CONCLUSIONS: The present study does not support GAD65, IA-2, or ZnT8 autoantibodies as markers of autoimmunity in canine diabetes in Samoyeds or Australian Terriers as measured using human antigen sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent (ELISA) assays. Future studies using canine specific assays as well as investigation for alternative markers of autoimmunity in these and other canine breeds are warranted.","O’Kell, Allison L.; Wasserfall, Clive H.; Henthorn, Paula S.; Atkinson, Mark A.; Hess, Rebecka S.",Canine Med Genet,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7491469/,450

Although Montalegre's MGs have considerable importance to the region's local economy, they are also high-risk events, to local and international health, due to the high number of foreigners on those events and the proximity to the Spanish border. RESULTS: The first in the field collaboration was the Forest Soul Gathering, a biennial transformational festival, held from 17th-21st of July 2019, with more than 1000 participants, from more than 20 countries. The collaboration with the local government continued throughout the year with several work meetings on Mass Gatherings and risk management. On Friday 6th, 2020, the PHU provided a risk assessment to the local government on the event Friday 13th (40.000 participants) and classified that risk as major due to the COVID-19 epidemic. In the local civil defense meeting, it was decided unanimously to cancel the event, taking into account the risk assessment of the PHU. LESSONS: There has been an increase in MG's in Portugal. This requires straight collaboration with the organization, health sector, and local authorities, to mitigate the risks of each event. This can be an example of how to go from theory to practice, in public health risk prevention, and institutional cooperation, being one of the first of its kind in Portugal. In the end, it allowed a fast response to the threat of COVID-19 and public health protection of the community of Montalegre. KEY MESSAGES: Proper preparation with partners to a public health emergency is vital to contain an outbreak. Local public health departments need to implement their emergency protocols and risk assessment procedures before a public health emergency.","Moreira de Sousa, A; Capucho, R",Eur J Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7543396/,450

40830,"Bitcoin, Libra und digitale Zentralbankwährungen — ein Geldsystem der Zukunft?",2020-09-25,"The host immune system has multiple innate immune receptors that can identify, distinguish and react to viral infections. In innate immune response, the host recognizes pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMP) in nucleic acids or viral proteins through pathogen recognition receptors (PRRs), especially toll-like receptors (TLRs) and induces immune cells or infected cells to produce type I Interferons (IFN-I) and pro-inflammatory cytokines, thus when the virus invades the host, innate immunity is the earliest immune mechanism. Besides, cytokine-mediated cell communication is necessary for the proper regulation of immune responses. Therefore, the appropriate activation of innate immunity is necessary for the normal life activities of cells. The suppressor of the cytokine signaling proteins (SOCS) family is one of the main regulators of the innate immune response induced by microbial pathogens. They mainly participate in the negative feedback regulation of cytokine signal transduction through Janus kinase signal transducer and transcriptional activator (JAK/STAT) and other signal pathways. Taken together, this paper reviews the SOCS proteins structures and the function of each domain, as well as the latest knowledge of the role of SOCS proteins in innate immune caused by viral infections and the mechanisms by which SOCS proteins assist viruses to escape host innate immunity. Finally, we discuss potential values of these proteins in future targeted therapies.","Huang, Shanzhi; Liu, Ke; Cheng, Anchun; Wang, Mingshu; Cui, Min; Huang, Juan; Zhu, Dekang; Chen, Shun; Liu, Mafeng; Zhao, Xinxin; Wu, Yin; Yang, Qiao; Zhang, Shaqiu; Ou, Xumin; Mao, Sai; Gao, Qun; Yu, Yanling; Tian, Bin; Liu, Yunya; Zhang, Ling; Yin, Zhongqiong; Jing, Bo; Chen, Xiaoyue; Jia, Renyong",Front Immunol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7544739/,450

In regards to the battle against chronic non-communicable disease, however, we believe the model of PA that would prove most salutary is one closely mimicking that of our hunter-gatherer ancestors. For the purpose of longevity, the human body and our genetic makeup have been evolutionarily adapted to respond best to moderate amounts of high-intensity interval training, in conjunction with high amounts of low intensity exercise. Moreover, to optimize resiliency and cardiorespiratory fitness, a hunter-gatherer fitness regimen must include cross training targeted at flexibility, balance and strength. Though not commonly understood, the health benefits from exercise comprise a reverse J-curve. The endurance athletes residing on the furthest reaches of the PA spectrum appear to lose a substantial portion of the exercise-related longevity and cardiovascular benefits due to cardiac overuse injury. Conversely, there is an emerging body of evidence suggesting leisure time exercise done with peers in a natural environment is significantly superior to that training done in solitude. This idea of the “power of play” lends support to the ancestral model of PA whereby humans are evolutionary adapted to be highly social, outdoor creatures capable of a diverse range of PA at varying intensities.","O’Keefe, Evan L.; Lavie, Carl J.",J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7590991/,450

We did not observe any polymorphisms associated with standard vaccine response outcomes (e.g., neutralizing antibody, T cell ELISPOT response, or T cell cytokine production); however, we did identify a cluster of SNPs on chromosome 5 (5q31.2) that were significantly associated (p-value: 1.3 x 10(−12) – 1.5x10(−36)) with IFNα response to in vitro poxvirus stimulation. Examination of these SNPs led to the functional testing of rs1131769, a non-synonymous SNP in TMEM173 causing an Arg-to-His change at position 232 in the STING protein—a major regulator of innate immune responses to viral infections. Our findings demonstrate differences in the ability of the two STING variants to phosphorylate the downstream intermediates TBK1 and IRF3 in response to multiple STING ligands. Further downstream in the STING pathway, we observed significantly reduced expression of type I IFNs (including IFNα) and IFN-response genes in cells carrying the H232 variant. Subsequent molecular modeling of both alleles predicted altered ligand binding characteristics between the two variants, providing a potential mechanism underlying differences in inter-individual responses to poxvirus infection. Our data indicate that possession of the H232 variant may impair STING-mediated innate immunity to poxviruses. These results clarify prior studies evaluating functional effects of genetic variants in TMEM173 and provide novel data regarding genetic control of poxvirus immunity.","Kennedy, Richard B.; Haralambieva, Iana H.; Ovsyannikova, Inna G.; Voigt, Emily A.; Larrabee, Beth R.; Schaid, Daniel J.; Zimmermann, Michael T.; Oberg, Ann L.; Poland, Gregory A.",Front Immunol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7591719/,450

The objective of this study was to compare rates of viral detection using singleplex and multiplex platforms in a research setting. METHODS: A prospective viral surveillance study was conducted in Davidson County, TN. Infants under one year who presented with fever and/or respiratory symptoms were enrolled from the outpatient, emergency department and inpatient settings. Nasal swabs were collected and tested for influenza A (FluA), influenza B (FluB), human metapneumovirus (MPV), respiratory syncytial virus A and B (RSVA and RSVB), human adenovirus (AdV), parainfluenza 1, 2, 3, and 4 (PIV1-4) and SARS-2-CoV by both singleplex qPCR and the Luminex NxTAG Respiratory Pathogen and NxTAG CoV Extended panels. The rhinovirus/enterovirus, human bocavirus, Chlamydophila pneumoniae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae and coronavirus HKU1, NL63, 229E and OC43 results from the Luminex panel were excluded because singleplex qPCR was not performed on those targets. For singleplex qPCR results, cycle threshold (Ct) values were used as a surrogate for viral load, with a higher Ct value indicating a lower viral load. RESULTS: A total of 112 nasal specimens were tested by both singleplex qPCR and Luminex, of which 65 were positive for at least one virus by either platform and 56 had a virus detected on both platforms (Figure 1). Seven specimens were positive by singleplex qPCR only and two were positive by Luminex only (Figure 1). The targets positive by singleplex qPCR only included FluB, RSVA, AdV and PIV2 and those positive by Luminex only included FluA H1N1 and RSVB (Figure 2). Specimens that were positive only on the singleplex assay had a higher average Ct value than those that were positive on both assays, indicating a lower viral load (Figure 3). Figure 1 [Image: see text] Figure 2 [Image: see text] Figure 3 [Image: see text] CONCLUSION: The multiplex assay identified 89% of the total viruses detected while singleplex qPCR identified 97% of the total viruses detected.

The available predicting models are useful in preoperative risk assessment, but there is a need for validated tools for the early postoperative period as well. Lung ultrasound is becoming popular in intensive and perioperative care and there is a growing interest to evaluate its role in the detection of postoperative pulmonary pathologies. OBJECTIVES: We aimed to identify characteristics with the potential of recognizing patients at risk by comparing the lung ultrasound scores (LUS) of patients with/without PPC in a 24-h postoperative timeframe. METHODS: Observational study at a university clinic. We recruited ASA 2–3 patients undergoing elective major abdominal surgery under general anaesthesia. LUS was assessed preoperatively, and also 1 and 24 h after surgery. Baseline and operative characteristics were also collected. A one-week follow up identified PPC+ and PPC- patients. Significantly differing LUS values underwent ROC analysis. A multi-variate logistic regression analysis with forward stepwise model building was performed to find independent predictors of PPCs. RESULTS: Out of the 77 recruited patients, 67 were included in the study. We evaluated 18 patients in the PPC+ and 49 in the PPC- group. Mean ages were 68.4 ± 10.2 and 66.4 ± 9.6 years, respectively (p = 0.4829). Patients conforming to ASA 3 class were significantly more represented in the PPC+ group (66.7 and 26.5%; p = 0.0026). LUS at baseline and in the postoperative hour were similar in both populations. The median LUS at 0 h was 1.5 (IQR 1–2) and 1 (IQR 0–2; p = 0.4625) in the PPC+ and PPC- groups, respectively. In the first postoperative hour, both groups had a marked increase, resulting in scores of 6.5 (IQR 3–9) and 5 (IQR 3–7; p = 0.1925). However, in the 24th hour, median LUS were significantly higher in the PPC+ group (6; IQR 6–10 vs 3; IQR 2–4; p < 0.0001) and it was an independent risk factor (OR = 2.6448 CI95% 1.5555–4.4971; p = 0.0003). ROC analysis identified the optimal cut-off at 5 points with high sensitivity (0.9444) and good specificity (0.7755). CONCLUSION: Postoperative LUS at 24 h can identify patients at risk of or in an early phase of PPCs.

This retrospective study assessed 164 consecutive CT chests of COVID-19 patients during April 2020. The chest CT and laboratory data were analyzed. The primary endpoint was patient survival either died or survived. The relationship between CT and laboratory findings was correlated to patient outcome. RESULTS: The study group included 164 patients (86 male, 78 women; average age, 44.3 ± 16.5 years) whose RT-PCR were positive for COVID-19. Only 120 (73.2%) patients had pulmonary manifestations. Ground glass opacities of peripheral distribution and multifocal affection were the major CT finding in COVID-19 patients. Univariate analysis revealed that CT severity score, D-dimer level, age, total leucocytic count, and absolute lymphocytic count were predictive for death. CONCLUSION: CT has an emerging role in the diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia and in assessing disease severity. CT severity score, D-dimer, total leucocytic count, and absolute lymphocytic count significantly predict patient survival.","Mohamed, Ibrahim A.

Vraagstelling van dit onderzoek was wat de afwegingen zijn van ouders om hun kind thuis te houden, en welke rol de jeugdgezondheidszorg (JGZ) hierbij speelt. Methode: Kwalitatief onderzoek bestaande uit semigestructureerde interviews met vijf schoolmedewerkers (van drie reguliere basisscholen en twee speciaal (basis)onderwijsscholen) en ouders van vier gezinnen die hun kind(eren) thuis hebben gehouden, in Groningen. De interviews zijn thematisch geanalyseerd. Resultaten: De gepercipieerde risico’s voor de gezondheid van een van de gezinsleden was de meest voorkomende reden om een kind niet naar school te laten gaan. Andere redenen waren zorgen over de gezondheid van het kind zelf en een algemene angst voor het virus, zonder dat er gezinsleden waren die binnen de risicogroepen vielen. De JGZ is nauwelijks bij de afweging van ouders betrokken geweest. Conclusie: Dit onderzoek naar COVID-19-gerelateerd schoolverzuim op basisscholen laat zien dat ouders angstig zijn vanwege de gezondheidsrisico’s voor hun gezin, ook in een regio met een lage besmettingsgraad, zoals Groningen in de eerste COVID-19-golf.

46476,Offenheit in der IT: Herausforderung und Chance zu Veränderungen,2021-03-06,"BACKGROUND AND AIM: During the recent COVID-19 pandemic, telemedicine has enabled many IBD patients worldwide to get access to remote assistance. Some positive reports on the use of telemedicine among patients and healthcare providers have been published(1-4), but a patient’s trust perspective is not available yet. The aim of our study was to verify IBD patients’ trust in telemedicine. This study was approved by our local Ethics Committee. MATERIAL AND METHODS: At our Gastroenterology Unit in Milan (Italy), 123 video-consultations were delivered to IBD patients with mild or moderate disease, in place of follow-up visits scheduled but not provided during the general lockdown (March-April 2020). Video-calling solutions from Google (Hangouts or Meet) or Microsoft Teams were used according to the patient’s preference. The patients’ trust in telemedicine was assessed through an adapted version of the PAtient Trust Assessment Tool (PATAT) questionnaire.(5) The primary endpoint was expressed as a >75% percentage of patients giving a score of at least 4 out of 5 in a Likert Scale for three selected key statements: “I can trust video-consultation”, “I can trust that possible problems with the telemedicine service will be solved properly” and “I feel at ease when working with this website”. The questionnaire was formulated through the EUSurvey platform, widely used for clinical research questionnaires in Europe. RESULTS: One-hundred-fifteen (93.4%) video-consultations were performed out of the 123 scheduled. Among the 115 consultations, 100 questionnaires were completed (86.9%). The primary endpoint of trust in the telemedicine service was achieved in 95%, 90% and 84% of patients for the three selected key statements about the trust in the telemedicine service, its capability to solve clinical problems and its ease to use. While clinical outcomes were beyond our intentions, we reported no drugs withdrawal in this cohort nor major events. CONCLUSION: Our results showed that during the COVID-19 pandemic most of our IBD patients accepted to receive a video-consultation in spite of the traditional in-person visit and trusted the video-consultation.

However, an analysis of 41 digital transformation frameworks following a developmental literature review shows that several areas can be expanded upon. We propose a novel framework that deals with the underrepresented areas by consolidating the various concepts found in the literature, explicitly including the role of society, highlighting the evolution over time, and including the drivers of digital transformation that we classified into 23 ‘digital transformation interactions’ across six categories. This novel perspective contributes to our macro-understanding of digital transformation and can be used as a lens for further research to generate fresh insights into unanswered research avenues.

It has not yet been extensively investigated which psychological changes the corona pandemic has brought about in Germany. OBJECTIVES: The aim was to systematically investigate loneliness before and during the corona pandemic in Germany. The research questions were as follows: (1) How lonely do people feel before and during the corona pandemic? (2) How many people feel lonelier since the beginning of the corona pandemic? (3) How many people are affected in their subjective health due to limitations following the corona pandemic? MATERIALS AND METHODS: In 2019 (before the corona pandemic) 1003 adults were interviewed and in 2020 (during the corona pandemic) 1050 adults were assessed. Both surveys were conducted online and were representative for Germany (51% women; age 18–90 years). RESULTS: In all, 10.8% vs. 26.6% of Germans felt lonely on two or more days per week before the corona pandemic vs. during the pandemic. Singles, women and younger respondents felt lonely more often in both surveys. Since the corona pandemic, 30.8% felt lonelier, especially younger individuals. Furthermore, 18.9% reported severely impaired health. Feeling more affected was related to younger age, various fears and more frequent perception of loneliness. CONCLUSION: Increasing loneliness and social isolation as well as various fears should be considered in further infection control measures. In general, overcoming loneliness in younger individuals and those living alone should be supported by building adequate coping skills that help to reduce impairments and fears.","Lippke, Sonia; Keller, Franziska; Derksen, Christina; Kötting, Lukas; Ratz, Tiara; Fleig, Lena",Pr&#x000e4;v Gesundheitsf,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7947937/,450

In the case of the vertical uniformity of an extended uniform slab, there deterministically exist invariant constructions different from and adequate to standard polarimetric invariants at symmetrical optical levels). These constructions express the properties of the local spatial angular symmetry of intensities of multiple scattered radiation internal fields in a more general analytical form of representation. For such new constructions of polarized radiation, which are called generalized polarimetric invariants, a basic boundary problem of the polarized radiation transfer theory has been formulated and linear Fredholm integral equations of the second kind and linear singular integral equations have been obtained. These generalized polarimetric invariants have proved to be effective for numerical modeling of intensities of multiple scattered polarized radiation in a uniform slab of an arbitrary optical thickness τ(0) ≤ ∞, with and without a reflecting bottom.","Smokty, Oleg I.",Computational Science and Its Applications - ICCSA 2020,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7975427/,450

Despite an enthusiastic response from younger generations and extensive support among the suburban middle class and ethnic minorities, they have been unable to foster synergy due to subtle differences in their reformist agendas. Adverse factors, such as the inherent deficiencies of the American political system in dealing with the challenges of globalization, the fragmentation of public opinion caused by the development of new technologies, and a growing sentiment among Americans to stay out of the trends in world politics, also hinder progressive propositions.

51907,Das Maskendilemma,2020-10-22,"Subject of this literature-based contribution are approaches to the communicative processing of conflicts in the context of energy infrastructure projects. A total of 83 sources were evaluated. The focus is on types of conflicts, measures of their (communicative) processing and the connections between conflict type, conflict object (technology) and conflict management. All in all, there is a clear need for research on customized approaches. Most approaches to (communicative) processing of conflict situations remain rather general. There are only a few authors, who consider the parameters conflict type and conflict object (e.g., wind energy versus deep geothermal energy). These consider primarily the types distribution conflict, value conflict, knowledge conflict and social conflict. The findings and recommendations on conflict communication are primarily based on the participation forms of information, cooperation and consultation. Recommendations on the information level are considered to be independent of the type of conflict, whereas measures on the cooperation and consultation level depend on the type of conflict. Less influence is ascribed to the variable technology. The focus is on (conflict- and technology-type related) topics and stakeholder groups and formats. Overall, it is noteworthy that formats are mentioned and presented, but mostly lack specific information on the how, i.e., the conflict-reducing communicative design of the processes and formats. Hints on how to do this are offered by a few studies on energy communication, which were also evaluated in this article. The development of approaches to the communicative processing of conflict situations that take a greater account of the type of conflict and the technology involved would contribute significantly to the development of customized overall strategies for energy transformation infrastructure projects.

METHOD: This was an international cohort study of patients undergoing elective colon or rectal cancer resection, without preoperative suspicion of SARS-CoV-2. Centres entered data from their first recorded case of COVID-19 until 19 April 2020. The primary outcome was 30-day mortality. Secondary outcomes included anastomotic leak, postoperative SARS-CoV-2, and a comparison with a pre-pandemic European Society of Coloproctology cohort data. RESULTS: From 2073 patients in 40 countries, 1.3% (27/2073) had a defunctioning stoma and 3.0% (63/2073) had an end stoma instead of an anastomosis only. 30-day mortality was 1.8% (38/2073), the incidence of postoperative SARS-CoV-2 was 3.8% (78/2073), and the anastomotic leak rate was 4.9% (86/1738). Mortality was lowest in patients without a leak or SARS-CoV2 (14/1601, 0.9%), and highest in patients with both a leak and SARS-CoV-2 (5/13, 38.5%). Mortality was independently associated with an anastomotic leak (adjusted odds ratio 6.01, 95% confidence interval 2.58-14.06), postoperative SARS-CoV-2 (16.90, 7.86-36.38), male sex (2.46, 1.01-5.93), age >70 years (2.87, 1.32-6.20), and advanced cancer stage (3.43, 1.16-10.21).

In this project we looked at how the Coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19) had impacted the diagnosis, management and outcomes of patients with appendicitis in our unit. METHOD: A retrospective review of patients diagnosed with appendicitis from 1(st) March – 30(th) April in 2019 and 2020. Data was collected on diagnosis, management and outcomes. RESULTS: In 2020, 91 patients were identified (mean 33, range 6-85, F:M 1:1.4). In 2019, 107 patients were identified (mean 32, range 7-69, M:F 1:1.1). There was no significant difference in patients’ symptom duration (p = 0.21), White Cell Count (p = 0.20) or C-Reactive Protein (p = 0.10). More CTs were performed in 2020 (56/91, 61.5%) than in 2019 (40/107, 37.4%). Less patients underwent appendicectomy in 2020 (75/91, 82.4%) than in 2019 (104/107, 97.2%). Open appendicectomies were performed in 64% (48/75) of those operated in 2020 compared with 12.2% (13/104) in 2019. There was no difference in hospital length of stay or re-admissions rates.

55024,Pädiatrische Psychosomatik,2021-06-29,"Autophagy is a major self-degradative process through which cytoplasmic material, including damaged organelles and proteins, are delivered and degraded in the lysosome. Autophagy represents a dynamic recycling system that produces new building blocks and energy, essential for cellular renovation, physiology, and homeostasis. Principal autophagy triggers include starvation, pathogens, and stress. Autophagy plays also a pivotal role in immune response regulation, including immune cell differentiation, antigen presentation and the generation of T effector responses, the development of protective immunity against pathogens, and the coordination of immunometabolic signals. A plethora of studies propose that both impaired and overactive autophagic processes contribute to the pathogenesis of human disorders, including infections, cancer, atherosclerosis, autoimmune and neurodegenerative diseases. Autophagy has been also implicated in the development and progression of allergen-driven airway inflammation and remodeling. Here, we provide an overview of recent studies pertinent to the biology of autophagy and molecular pathways controlling its activation, we discuss autophagy-mediated beneficial and detrimental effects in animal models of allergic diseases and illuminate new advances on the role of autophagy in the pathogenesis of human asthma.

INTRODUCTION: When considering anatomy in medical school, one challenge facing medical education is integrating preclinical anatomy knowledge with the procedural experiences and pathology encounters of clerkship years.(1,2) COVID‐19 has further exacerbated this challenge by forcing medical school institutions to maintain social‐distancing through reshaping their approach to teaching anatomy. The most notable changes include limiting on‐site anatomy laboratory experiences and increasing virtual didactic anatomy sessions. By integrating a virtual 3D anatomy platform into a prosection driven lab curriculum, the possible quality impacts to anatomy medical education may be lessened and even improved.(3‐9) MATERIALS AND METHODS: First‐year medical students at HWCOM (CO 2024) participated. Groups of 4‐10 students rotated through six 20‐minute stations. Two of the six 20‐minute stations were facilitated by a fourth year medical teaching assistant (TA). In each station led by the TA, the TA utilized a didactic teaching model to teach select gastrointestinal and genitourinary anatomy and pathology topics using a prosected cadaver and prosected 3D virtual anatomy models on the Complete Anatomy application. The first ten to fifteen minutes of teaching involved using the prosected cadaver and the final five to ten minutes involved the 3D virtual prosected models. The 3D virtual prosected models were used to further explain anatomical features or pathologies identified on the cadaver. Prior to or after the station was completed, students rotated at the four 20‐minute self‐learning stations that contained plastinated models, plastic models, or wet organ specimens of gastrointestinal anatomy. At these stations, students completed a worksheet based on the lab objectives for gastrointestinal and genitourinary anatomy. A five‐question end‐of‐course survey (5‐point Likert Scale) will be administered to all first‐year medical students who participated in the wet lab session. RESULTS: We expect the results of our end‐of‐course survey to support our hypothesis that the integrated didactic anatomy teaching model would improve first year medical students’ understanding of the course material. Additionally, we expect the students to recommend incorporating the Complete Anatomy app with the prosected models for the first‐year anatomy lab curriculum. Final data analysis of the variables will be completed after obtaining IRB exemption. CONCLUSION AND SIGNIFICANCE/IMPLICATION: Despite the limitations to human anatomy medical education due to the COVID pandemic, we believe this novel integrated virtual 3D and cadaver prosection approach to the traditional anatomy curriculum will not only lessen the impacts to quality but also improve the baseline quality of anatomy medical education, become a permanent inclusion within our institution's curriculum, and serve as a model for novel approaches to first‐year anatomy curriculum.","De Witte, Anton; Payomo, Andrew; Ravikumaran Nair, Rakesh",FASEB J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8239913/,450

The subregion includes six states, accounting for 23.3% of the world’s population, 25.7% of global GDP, and 22.1% of global merchandise exports. Despite significant potential, NEA countries do not have six-party agreements on trade, investment, customs, or migration cooperation, preferring projects with a wider range of participants. There are also no such agreements on a trilateral basis between the countries of the Big Three–China, Japan, and South Korea—which act as the “locomotive” of NEA. These areas of cooperation are developing mainly on a bilateral basis. The overwhelming majority of agreements on free trade areas signed by the NEA countries fall on non-regional partners. At the same time, North Korea is characterized by a complete absence of agreements, Russia has no agreements with partners in the subregion, and Mongolia, South Korea, China, and Japan have one agreement within the NEA framework. The process of negotiating and implementing agreements (both multilateral and bilateral) is greatly complicated by periodic exacerbation of Chinese-Japanese and Korean-Japanese relations, as well as by North Korean nuclear weapons tests.","Demina, Ya.

METHODS: Ninety-four HCC patients who underwent CT scanning 1 week before the first TACE treatment were retrospectively recruited and divided randomly into a training group (n = 47) and a validation group (n = 47). NC-CT radiomics data were extracted using MaZda software, and the compound model was calculated from radiomics and clinical features by logistic regression. The performance of the different models was compared by examining the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). The prediction of prognosis was evaluated using survival analysis. RESULTS: Thirty NC-CT radiomic features were extracted and analyzed. The compound model was formed using four NC-CT run-length matrix (RLM) features and general image features, which included the maximum diameter (cm) of the tumor and the number of tumors (n). The AUCs of the model for TACE response were 0.840 and 0.815, whereas the AUCs of the six-and-twelve grade were 0.754 and 0.750 in the training and validation groups, respectively. HCC patients were divided into two groups using the cutoff value of the model: a group in which the TACE-response led to good survival and a group in which TACE-nonresponse caused poor prognosis. CONCLUSION: Radiomic features from NC-CT predicted TACE-response. The compound model generated by NC-CT radiomics and clinical features is effective and directly predicts TACE-response and overall survival. The model may be used repeatedly and is easy to operate.","Guo, Zheng; Zhong, Nanying; Xu, Xueming; Zhang, Yu; Luo, Xiaoning; Zhu, Huabin; Zhang, Xiufang; Wu, Di; Qiu, Yingwei; Tu, Fuping",J Hepatocell Carcinoma,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8277455/,450

Environment friendly strategies to extend the quality of grapes after commercial maturity provide healthy and profitable sustainability in market chain. In the present study, possibilities to maintain the quality of grape clusters on grapevines without any chemical treatments have been studied under vineyard conditions in temperate climate characteristics of Konya Province in Central Anatolia. Grape clusters of ‘Alphonse Lavallée’ and ‘Narince’, one of the most popular conventional grape cultivar in Turkey, were kept on the vines trained with bilateral cordon system. The vines were drip irrigated during the hot summer and the vine canopy was covered with black nets after veraison to protect from the birds, hail and climatic extremities. After commercial maturity, twelve cluster samples per cultivar were collected with monthly intervals to investigate the changes in quality. Up to the 3rd sampling date (at the end of November 2019), little losses in quality features were determined in both cultivars. At the end of the study, at 4th moth (December), significant decay incidences were observed with similar patterns in cultivars. General findings demonstrated that the grape clusters could be maintained on grapevines under intact condition of the cool autumn season in temperate zone by protecting them from the external damages using convenient protective materials up to three or four months depending on the response of cultivars to environmental variables.","Sabir, Ferhan K.; Sabir, Ali; Unal, Sevil",Erwerbs-Obstbau,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8299445/,450

An online survey was completed by 271 Libyan migrant families. Data collection included the 18-item US Household Food Security Survey Module (for food security) and a question from the Food Standards Australia New Zealand Consumer Label Survey (for food labelling comprehension). Multivariable logistic regression modelling was utilised to identify the predictors of food label comprehension and food security. Food insecurity prevalence was 72.7% (n = 196) while 35.8% of families (n = 97) reported limited food label understanding. Household size, food store location, and food affordability were found to be significantly related to food insecurity. However, gender, private health insurance, household annual income, education, and food store type and location were found to be significantly related to food labelling comprehension. Despite the population’s high educational status and food labelling comprehension level, food insecurity remained an issue among the Libyan migrants.

56435,Erste Jahresberichte dokumentieren erfolgreiche Entwicklung,2021-08-11,"In persons beyond age 70 a decrease of muscle mass and an increase of fat mass are regularly observed. These changes of body composition constitute a relevant predisposition for the imminent loss of functionality and autonomy in older age. In this context adequate nutrition and the prevention of malnutrition play an essential role. As the older population is extremely heterogeneous with regard to the velocity and extent of aging processes and also with regard to comorbidities, recommendations for adequate nutrition have to be individualized. Even voluntary loss of weight may be critical as it may accelerate the development of sarcopenia. As a general rule periods of fasting should be avoided. This is especially true with regard to inadequate caloric intake in the course of acute and chronic diseases. Therefore, weight measurements should be performed regularly in older persons, which would allow early diagnosis and treatment of malnutrition. In comparison to younger adults a higher protein intake of 1.0 g/kg bodyweight is recommended for older persons, as this may slow their decline of muscle mass and muscle function. If sarcopenia is already present, the recommended protein intake is raised towards 1.2 g/kg bodyweight. While restrictive are diets may be detrimental in older persons, healthy diets like the Mediterranean diet may support the preservation of muscular and cognitive function.","Bauer, Jürgen M.",Gastroenterologe,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8320417/,450
56460,Lehren aus der Russischen Grippe für das Endspiel der derzeitigen Pandemie – die Exitstrategie für Deutschland: Eine Streitschrift,2021-08-05,"Background: The COMET Initiative promotes the development and use of ‘core outcome sets’ (COS), agreed standardised sets of outcomes that should be measured and reported in all studies in a particular clinical condition. COS are determined by consensus amongst key stakeholders, including health professionals, policymakers and patients, ensuring that the priorities and expertise of these representatives inform the choice of the most important outcomes to measure for a given condition. There is increased recognition of the need to integrate COS across the healthcare system and with existing regulatory apparatus, to ensure that outcomes being recorded are those of key relevance to important stakeholders. The aim of this study is to assess the degree of concordance between outcomes recommended in COS for research and in guidance provided by two key regulators: US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the European Medicines Agency (EMA). Methods: COS for research published during 2015-2019 with patient involvement and covering drug or device interventions will be compared against relevant regulatory guidelines, matched by condition. Guidance documents matching in scope (relating to intervention and population) to a COS for research will be scrutinised to identify all suggested outcomes for comparison against the core outcomes in the corresponding COS. Discussion: This study will identify variation between outcomes suggested in FDA and EMA regulatory guidance relative to outcomes included in published COS for research, thus demonstrating the degree of representation of COS in regulatory guidance and vice versa. We will share the study findings (in particular, highlighting any lack of concordance between COS and regulatory guidance overall or for particular disease areas) and will invite feedback from FDA and EMA; we will seek to highlight where findings support the recommendations towards using well-developed COS or will make recommendations to COS developers on outcomes of importance to these key regulators.","Dodd, Susanna; Fish, Rebecca; Gorst, Sarah; Hall, Deborah; Jacobsen, Pamela; Kirkham, Jamie; Main, Barry; Matvienko-Sikar, Karen; Saldanha, Ian J.; Trépel, Dominic; Williamson, Paula R.",HRB Open Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8311813/,450

Haut und Harz Revival für Niedergelassene und Kliniker,2021-08-13,"Personalized nanomedicine has rapidly evolved over the past decade to tailor the diagnosis and treatment of several diseases to the individual characteristics of each patient. In oncology, iron oxide nano-biomaterials (NBMs) have become a promising biomedical product in targeted drug delivery as well as in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) as a contrast agent and magnetic hyperthermia. The combination of diagnosis and therapy in a single nano-enabled product (so-called theranostic agent) in the personalized nanomedicine has been investigated so far mostly in terms of local events, causes-effects, and mutual relationships. However, this approach could fail in capturing the overall complexity of a system, whereas systemic approaches can be used to study the organization of phenomena in terms of dynamic configurations, independent of the nature, type, or spatial and temporal scale of the elements of the system. In medicine, complex descriptions of diseases and their evolution are daily assessed in clinical settings, which can be thus considered as complex systems exhibiting self-organizing and non-linear features, to be investigated through the identification of dynamic feedback-driven behaviors. In this study, a Systems Thinking (ST) approach is proposed to represent the complexity of the theranostic modalities in the context of the personalized nanomedicine through the setting up of a stock-flow diagram. Specifically, the interconnections between the administration of magnetite NBMs for diagnosis and therapy of tumors are fully identified, emphasizing the role of the feedback loops. The presented approach has revealed its suitability for further application in the medical field. In particular, the obtained stock-flow diagram can be adapted for improving the future knowledge of complex systems in personalized nanomedicine as well as in other nanosafety areas.","Cazzagon, Virginia; Romano, Alessandra; Gonella, Francesco",Front Bioeng Biotechnol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8339728/,450

Through its FinTech (Financial Technology) Strategy, Qatar has sought to embrace DLT, but its regulatory approach also remains cautious. Trade Finance is an ideal business process to be disrupted through the benefits of DLT and especially Blockchain technology, since its processes remain antiquated, inefficient and lack digitization. Blockchain as a form of DLT particularly offers the Trade Finance process not only more rapid, secure, cost-effective and efficient procedures, but importantly completely assures trust between importers and exporters and removes the requirement to place such trust in third-party intermediaries. Qatar can reap considerable economic benefits through the enhancement of its Trade Finance regulations enabling the adoption of such Blockchain technology. As such, the authors propose a roadmap and manual for the governance of the Trade Finance Blockchain ecosystem in Qatar. The authors propose multi-layered governance approach to the regulation of Blockchain in Qatar by (1) embracing international regulations and standards; (2) replicating foreign regional and national rules that are appropriate and innovative; and (3) applying sandbox regulations to Blockchain products and services.","Ibrahim, Imad Antoine; Truby, Jon",J Bank Regul,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8414031/,450

It would be more correct to say that there is no such area of biology and medicine where chromatography–mass spectrometry would not find application. This article focuses on the areas of application of this technique that are either relatively new or insufficiently covered in recent reviews. State-of-the-art bioanalytical techniques have become multitargeted in terms of analytes and standardized in terms of matrices. The ability to detect trace concentrations of analytes in the presence of a huge number of biomatrix macrocomponents using chromatography–mass spectrometry is especially important for bioanalytical chemistry. In the target-oriented determination of persistent organic pollutants by chromatography–mass spectrometry, the main problem is the expansion of the list of analytes, including isomers. In the detection of exposures to unstable toxicants, the fragmented adducts of xenobiotics with biomolecules become target biomarkers along with hydrolytic metabolites. The exposome reflects the general exposure of a human being to total xenobiotics and the metabolic status reflects the physiological state of the body. Chromatography–mass spectrometry is a key technique in metabolomics. Metabolomics is currently used to solve the problems of clinical diagnostics and anti-doping control. Biological sample preparation procedures for instrumental analysis are being simplified and developed toward increasing versatility. Proteomic technologies with the use of various versions of mass spectrometry have found application in the development of new methods for diagnosing coronavirus infections.","Savelieva, E.

Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) has shown some promise in the management of COVID 19. Minocycline, because of its anti-cytokine and other useful properties can be an ideal candidate for combining with HCQ. AREAS COVERED Here we review the need and mechanisms and reasons for combining HCQ and minocycline moderate to severe COVID-19 infection. We also reviewed the advantages, potential safety concerns and precautions to be taken, while combining HCQ and minocycline. EXPERT OPINION Combining HCQ and minocycline offers many advantages in the management of moderate to severe COVID-19 infection. Both drugs are cheaper, widely available and long-term safety data and contraindications are well known. We do not recommend this combination for prophylaxis or use in asymptomatic or mild disease patients as this can lead to unnecessary safety concerns. Additive antimicrobial and anti-cytokine effects of both drugs may reduce the morbidity and mortality among patients with COVID-19 and may act as a cheaper alternative to the costlier drugs, however thorough clinical research is warranted. We call upon public and private healthcare bodies to come up with large well-designed clinical studies for generating evidence-based recommendations.","Gautam, Shashank Shekhar; Gautam, C S; Garg, Vivek Kumar; Singh, Harmanjit",Expert review of clinical pharmacology,https://doi.org/10.1080/17512433.2020.1832889; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33008280/,450

It allows patients and caregivers to discuss their health problems and symptoms with qualified medical health professionals via the Internet. OBJECTIVE This study investigates the questions posted on an asynchronous online medical consultation website, Taiwan eDoctor. Five research themes are explored: (1) length of questions, (2) moment of seeking consultation, (3) strategies of communicating chief complaints, (4) purpose of seeking consultation and (5) identity disclosure. METHODS Data collection was conducted by randomly selecting 50 resolved consultation Q&As for each of 24 medical specialties, resulting in a total of 1200 entries in the primary data set. Data analysis was conducted qualitatively and quantitatively. RESULTS Average length of questions was 161.21 words. Online medical consultation was sought when healthy, healthy but not robust, when suspicious of illness, when diagnosed as ill and during treatment/recovery. In communicating chief complaints, consultation seekers were engaged in contextual, focal or emotional communication styles. Nine distinct purposes to seek online consultation were identified and can be broadly interpreted as intellectual, social and emotional. The finding also suggests that more than two-third of questions were asked for by the patients themselves. CONCLUSION Through content analysis of questions posted on an online medical consultation website, this study characterises communication patterns during the health information seeking process. These findings can help guide the design of more effective patient-centred online medical consultation services.","Chiu, Ming-Hsin Phoebe",Health information and libraries journal,https://doi.org/10.1111/hir.12153; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27380768/,450

METHODS In this cross-sectional study, data were collected with an online survey delivered through Qualtrics and posted on the Facebook page and website of a patient association (Associazione Progetto Endometriosi-APE) in August 2020. The survey was composed of a researcher-made questionnaire and four validated questionnaires assessing relational satisfaction (adapted Quality of Marriage Index), dyadic coping (Dyadic Coping Questionnaire), and psychological health (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale and Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale). RESULTS Participants were 316 women (age: 35.9 ± 6.7) with endometriosis, who reported being in an intimate relationship from at least one year. A greater perceived negative impact of the disease on past and current intimate relationships was associated with poorer psychological health, lower relational satisfaction and worse dyadic coping. Women who perceived their partner as more informed about endometriosis, more informed about and interested in their health conditions, and more likely to accompany them to the medical appointments, showed greater relational satisfaction and dyadic coping. Relational satisfaction and dyadic coping were associated with psychological health. A greater perceived negative impact of endometriosis on intimate relationships was associated with more severe pelvic pain (especially dyspareunia). CONCLUSION Endometriosis has a negative impact on intimate relationships, which is associated with poorer psychological health. For the women with the disease, partner's support is important, and our findings suggest that effort should be made to involve both members of the couple in multidisciplinary treatment.","Facchin, Federica; Buggio, Laura; Vercellini, Paolo; Frassineti, Annalisa; Beltrami, Sara; Saita, Emanuela",Journal of psychosomatic research,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpsychores.2021.110502; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33932718/,450

This review summarizes the knowledge on the diagnosis and management of stingers in college and professional collision athletes by providing an overview of their epidemiology and pathophysiology, followed by a discussion on current treatment guidelines and return-to-play recommendations. RECENT FINDINGS Despite modifications to tackling technique, increasing awareness, and various equipment options, American football continues to have a high rate of cervical spine injuries, the majority of which occur in preseason and regular season competition settings. The incidence of stingers has slowly increased among collision athletes, and nearly half of all players report sustaining at least one stinger in their career. Recent studies have shown certain anatomical changes in the cervical spine are related to acute and reoccurring stingers. Most players who experience stingers do not miss practices or games. Despite their prevalence, literature highlighting the impact of stingers on college and professional collision athletes is limited. Advances in imaging modalities and novel radiographic parameters have provided tools for screening athletes and can guide return-to-play decisions. Future research regarding appropriate screening practices for athletes with reoccurring stingers, use of protective equipment, and rehabilitation strategies are needed to identify predisposing factors, mitigate the risk of injury, and restore full functional strength and ability.","Bowles, Daniel R; Canseco, Jose A; Alexander, Tyler D; Schroeder, Gregory D; Hecht, Andrew C; Vaccaro, Alexander R",Current reviews in musculoskeletal medicine,https://doi.org/10.1007/s12178-020-09665-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32691363/,450

The optimal individual preemptive or intraoperative anesthetic modality on postoperative pain control is not well-known. PURPOSE To systematically review and perform a meta-analysis comparing postoperative pain scores (visual analog scale [VAS]), opioid consumption, and incidence of complications during the first 24 hours after primary ACLR in patients receiving spinal anesthetic, adjunct regional nerve blocks, or local analgesics. STUDY DESIGN Systematic review and meta-analysis. METHODS PubMed, Embase, MEDLINE, Biosis Previews, SPORTDiscus, Ovid, PEDRO, and the Cochrane Library databases were systematically searched from inception to March 2020 for human studies, using a PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) checklist. Inclusion criteria consisted of (1) level 1 studies reporting on the use of spinal anesthesia, adjunct regional anesthesia (femoral nerve block [FNB] or adductor canal block [ACB]), or local analgesia in patients undergoing primary ACLR and (2) studies reporting on patient-reported VAS, opioid consumption, and incidence of complications related to anesthesia within the first 24 hours after surgery. Non-level 1 studies, studies utilizing a combination of anesthetic modalities, and those not reporting outcomes during the first 24 hours were excluded. Data were synthesized, and a random effects meta-analysis was performed to determine postoperative pain, opioid use, and complications based on anesthetic modality at multiple time points (0-4, 4-8, 8-12, 12-24 hours). RESULTS A total of 263 studies were screened, of which 27 level 1 studies (n = 16 regional blocks; n = 12 local; n = 4 spinal) met the inclusion criteria and were included in the meta-analysis. VAS scores were significantly lower in patients receiving a regional block as compared with spinal anesthesia 8 to 12 hours after surgery (P < .01), patients receiving an FNB versus ACB at 12 to 24 hours (P < .01), and those treated with a continuous FNB rather than single-shot regional blocks (FNB, ACB) at 12 to 24 hours (P < .01). No significant difference in VAS was appreciated when spinal, regional, and local anesthesia groups were compared. CONCLUSION Based on evidence from level 1 studies, pain control after primary ACLR based on VAS was significantly improved at 8 to 12 hours in patients receiving regional anesthesia as compared with spinal anesthesia. Pain scores were significantly lower at 12 to 24 hours in patients receiving FNB versus ACB and those treated with continuous FNB rather than single-shot regional anesthetic.","Maheshwer, Bhargavi; Knapik, Derrick M; Polce, Evan M; Verma, Nikhil N; LaPrade, Robert F; Chahla, Jorge",The American journal of sports medicine,https://doi.org/10.1177/0363546520980429; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33411564/,450

69335,Level of Evidence in Facial Plastic Surgery Research: A Procedure-Level Analysis.,2020-04-23,"The Government of Thailand was prompt to launch social and economic measures to mitigate the effects on the general population following lockdown measures to counter coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). However, sex workers were one of the vulnerable groups who were unable to access state support. A rapid survey of sex workers in Thailand showed that almost all had become unemployed and lost their income as a consequence of the lockdown, restrictions on international flights into the country and the closure of entertainment venues. Most were unable to cover the costs of food and shelter for themselves and their dependents. COVID-19 had also disrupted testing and treatment for sexually transmitted infections and HIV services for sex workers. As in other countries, community-based organizations were essential to providing an immediate, short-term COVID-19 response for sex workers. Also as in other countries, the pandemic has demonstrated that many people's health and well-being depends on very fragile foundations. This presents a clear opportunity to build back better by committing to a longer-term vision for the overall societal inclusion of sex workers. Thailand should advocate for decriminalization of sex work and ensure sex workers are entitled to equal labour rights and inclusion in the government social protection programme. Progress in innovative government initiatives aimed at ending HIV stigma and discrimination show how structural change can come about through harnessing community-based organizations. In turn, HIV services for sex workers need to expand and incorporate targeted interventions to reduce sex workers' occupational susceptibility to COVID-19.","Janyam, Surang; Phuengsamran, Dusita; Pangnongyang, Jamrong; Saripra, Wutikan; Jitwattanapataya, Ladda; Songsamphan, Chalidaporn; Benjarattanaporn, Patchara; Gopinath, Deyer",WHO South-East Asia journal of public health,https://doi.org/10.4103/2224-3151.294301; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32978340/,450
69594,Abdominoplasty access for desmoid tumor resection in the rectus abdominis muscle.,2013,"INTRODUCTION Optical trocar access is a technique to place the initial trocar in laparoscopic surgery. With optical trocar access, each tissue layer can be visualized before insertion, which can help prevent organ injury, and air leaks at the trocar site can be minimized even in obese patients. The aim of this study was to compare the time needed for trocar insertion using optical trocar access and an open method in patients who underwent laparoscopic gastrointestinal surgery. METHODS We reviewed our prospectively collected database and identified 384 patients who underwent laparoscopic gastrointestinal surgery involving initial trocar insertion near the umbilicus by either the optical trocar access or the open method. Before the two methods were compared, propensity score matching was used to adjust for essential variables between the optical trocar access and open groups. RESULTS Patients categorized in the optical trocar access and open groups were matched one-to-one by propensity score matching, and 137 pairs of patients were generated. The time needed for trocar insertion was significantly shorter in the optical trocar access group than in the open group (36.6 vs 209.8 s, P < 0.01). The multivariable analysis identified an inexperienced surgeon as the only independent risk factor for prolonged time for initial trocar insertion using the optical trocar access. CONCLUSIONS This study indicated that optical trocar access may be recommended for inserting the initial trocar in laparoscopic gastrointestinal surgery.","Tanaka, Chie; Fujiwara, Michitaka; Kanda, Mitsuro; Murotani, Kenta; Iwata, Naoki; Hayashi, Masamichi; Kobayashi, Daisuke; Yamada, Suguru; Kodera, Yasuhiro",Asian journal of endoscopic surgery,https://doi.org/10.1111/ases.12484; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29673123/,450
71875,Endovascular preoperative embolization of orbital hemangiopericytoma with n-butyl cyanoacrylate glue.,2014,"Purpose Squamous cell carcinoma of the anal canal (SCCAC) is characterized by high locoregional failure (LRF) rates after sphincter-preserving definitive chemoradiation (CRT) and is typically associated with anogenital human papilloma virus infection. Because cetuximab enhances the effect of radiation therapy in human papilloma virus-associated oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma, we hypothesized that adding cetuximab to CRT would reduce LRF in SCCAC. Methods Sixty-one patients with stage I to III SCCAC received CRT including cisplatin, fluorouracil, and radiation therapy to the primary tumor and regional lymph nodes (45 to 54 Gy) plus eight once-weekly doses of concurrent cetuximab. The study was designed to detect at least a 50% reduction in 3-year LRF rate (one-sided α, 0.10; power 90%), assuming a 35% LRF rate from historical data. Results Poor risk features included stage III disease in 64% and male sex in 20%. The 3-year LRF rate was 23% (95% CI, 13% to 36%; one-sided P = .03) by binomial proportional estimate using the prespecified end point and 21% (95% CI, 7% to 26%) by Kaplan-Meier estimate in a post hoc analysis using methods consistent with historical data. Three-year rates were 68% (95% CI, 55% to 79%) for progression-free survival and 83% (95% CI, 71% to 91%) for overall survival. Grade 4 toxicity occurred in 32%, and 5% had treatment-associated deaths. Conclusion Although the addition of cetuximab to chemoradiation for SCCAC was associated with lower LRF rates than historical data with CRT alone, toxicity was substantial, and LRF still occurs in approximately 20%, indicating the continued need for more effective and less toxic therapies.","Garg, Madhur K; Zhao, Fengmin; Sparano, Joseph A; Palefsky, Joel; Whittington, Richard; Mitchell, Edith P; Mulcahy, Mary F; Armstrong, Karin I; Nabbout, Nassim H; Kalnicki, Shalom; El-Rayes, Bassel F; Onitilo, Adedayo A; Moriarty, Daniel J; Fitzgerald, Thomas J; Benson, Al B",Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,https://doi.org/10.1200/jco.2016.69.1667; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28068178/,450

In addition, the measures that succeeded in containing the epidemic created a deep economic crisis, which real dimension is still unclear. It is clear however, that most health care systems were unprepared. Years of cost containments had eroded the ability of the health care sector to cope with the surge in cases. This editorial contends that rebuilding the health care systems will require forward thinking, a data driven approach and avoidance of reactive decision making. The editorial proposes the Value Based Medicine approach as way to avoid the errors of the past and to align decision making and costing in health care with patient health and quality of life (Value). This is an approach that is gaining traction in several systems. It needs a built-in capability to collect and analyze outcome and cost data.

Antibody dynamics were examined from birth to the postpartum period in replacement heifers (n = 14) born to non-vaccinated dams (n = 7) or to dams that had been vaccinated on gestation days 171-177 (n = 7) and 192-198. Samples of blood, milk, faeces, vaginal fluid, colostrum and cotyledons (the latter two only at parturition) were obtained in the dams over the period from gestation days 171-177 to postpartum days 91-97. Blood samples were used to detect antibodies against C. burnetii and remaining samples for PCR identification of the bacterium. In their calves/heifers, blood samples for antibody determinations were collected from birth to postpartum at the time points 1-7 and 22-28 days and 3, 6 and 12 months of age; 90-96 and 210-216 days of gestation; and 22-28 days postpartum. All calves were born seronegative for C. burnetii. Irrespective of the shedding status of their mothers (7 were C. burnetii shedders), seroconversion occurred after colostrum intake in all calves born to seropositive cows (n = 9) and in two of three vaccinated seronegative dams. Thereafter antibody titres gradually declined and by 6 months of age all calves were seronegative. Seronegativity persisted until their first postpartum period. These findings indicate that cows vaccinated during advanced pregnancy transfer immunity to their calves via the colostrum. Maternal C. burnetii antibodies in calves persisted for three months in calves born both to seronegative vaccinated and seropositive dams.","Tutusaus, Joan; Garcia-Ispierto, Irina; López-Gatius, Fernando",Acta veterinaria Hungarica,https://doi.org/10.1556/004.2015.031; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26551423/,450

81116,Five-year experience with modified Fogli (Loré's fascia fixation) platysmaplasty.,2012,"OBJECTIVE To report the perioperative findings and outcome of dogs undergoing video-assisted thoracic surgery (VATS) for the management of pyothorax. DESIGN Multi-institutional, retrospective study. ANIMALS Client-owned dogs (n = 14). METHODS Medical records of dogs with pyothorax managed via VATS were reviewed for signalment, history, clinical signs, clinicopathological findings, diagnostic imaging results, surgical variables, bacterial culture and sensitivity results, post-operative management and outcome. VATS was performed after placing a paraxyphoid endoscopic portal and 2-3 intercostal instrument portals. VATS exploration was followed by one or more of the following: mediastinal debridement, tissue sampling, pleural lavage, and placement of a thoracostomy tube. RESULTS Two dogs (14%) required conversion from VATS to an open thoracotomy to completely resect proliferative mediastinal tissue. These dogs had severe pleural effusion on preoperative thoracic radiographs and one had severely thickened contrast-enhancing mediastinum on preoperative computed tomography (CT). The cause of pyothorax was identified as a penetrating gastric foreign body (n = 2), migrating plant material (n = 2), and idiopathic (n = 10). The median follow-up time was 143 days (range, 14-2402 days). All dogs were discharged from the hospital and their clinical signs resolved. One patient had recurrence of a pyothorax requiring revision surgery 17 months postoperatively. CONCLUSION VATS allows minimally invasive treatment of uncomplicated canine pyothorax. Preoperative thoracic CT may help identify candidates for VATS among dogs with pyothorax.","Scott, Jacqueline; Singh, Ameet; Monnet, Eric; Coleman, Kristin A; Runge, Jeffrey J; Case, Joseph Brad; Mayhew, Philipp D",Veterinary surgery : VS,https://doi.org/10.1111/vsu.12661; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28460424/,450
81303,Supercharged Jejunal Interposition: A Reliable Esophageal Replacement in Pediatric Patients.,2019,"BACKGROUND Lower gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms are poor predictors of colorectal cancer (CRC). This study examined the diagnostic yield of colonoscopy by faecal haemoglobin concentration (f-Hb) in symptomatic patients assessed in primary care by faecal immunochemical testing (FIT). METHODS In three Scottish NHS Boards, FIT kits (HM-JACKarc, Hitachi Chemical Diagnostics Systems Co., Ltd, Tokyo, Japan) were used by GPs to guide referrals for patients with lower GI symptoms (lab data studied for 12 months from December 2015 onward in Tayside, 18 months from June 2018 onward in Fife, and 5 months from September 2018 onward in Greater Glasgow and Clyde). CRC cases diagnosed at colonoscopy were ascertained from colonoscopy and pathology records. RESULTS 4841 symptomatic patients who underwent colonoscopy after FIT submission were included. Of 2166 patients (44.7%) with f-Hb <10 µg Hb/g faeces (µg/g), 14 (0.6%) were diagnosed with CRC, with a number needed to scope (NNS) of 155. Of 2675 patients (55.3%) with f-Hb ≥10 µg/g, 252 were diagnosed with CRC (9.4%) with a NNS of 11. Of 705 patients with f-Hb ≥400 µg/g, 158 (22.4%) were diagnosed with CRC with a NNS of 5. Over half of those diagnosed with CRC with f-Hb <10 µg/g had co-existing anaemia. CONCLUSIONS Symptomatic patients with f-Hb ≥10 µg/g should undergo further investigation for CRC, while higher f-Hb could be used to triage its urgency during the COVID-19 recovery phase. Patients with f-Hb <10 µg/g, without anaemia, are very unlikely to be diagnosed with CRC and the majority need no further investigation.","McSorley, Stephen T; Digby, Jayne; Clyde, Danielle; Cruickshank, Neil; Burton, Paul; Barker, Louise; Strachan, Judith A; Fraser, Callum G; Smith, Karen; Mowat, Craig; Winter, Jack; Steele, Robert Jc",Colorectal disease : the official journal of the Association of Coloproctology of Great Britain and Ireland,https://doi.org/10.1111/codi.15405; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33064898/,450
82786,A Porcine Orthotopic Forelimb Vascularized Composite Allotransplantation Model: Technical Considerations and Translational Implications.,2016,"INTRODUCTION Liver transplantation (LT) is an effective treatment for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), the most common type of primary liver cancer. Patients with small HCC (<5 cm) are given priority over others for transplantation due to clinical allocation policies based on tumor size. Attempting to shift from the prevalent paradigm that successful transplantation and longer disease-free survival can only be achieved in patients with small HCC to expanding the transplantation option to patients with HCC of the highest tumor burden (>5 cm), we developed a convergent artificial intelligence (AI) model that combines transient clinical data with quantitative histologic and radiomic features for more objective risk assessment of liver transplantation for HCC patients. METHODS Patients who received a LT for HCC between 2008-2019 were eligible for inclusion in the analysis. All patients with post-LT recurrence were included, and those without recurrence were randomly selected for inclusion in the deep learning model. Pre- and post-transplant magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans and reports were compressed using CapsNet networks and natural language processing, respectively, as input for a multiple feature radial basis function network. We applied a histological image analysis algorithm to detect pathologic areas of interest from explant tissue of patients who recurred. The multilayer perceptron was designed as a feed-forward, supervised neural network topology, with the final assessment of recurrence risk. We used area under the curve (AUC) and F-1 score to assess the predictability of different network combinations. RESULTS A total of 109 patients were included (87 in the training group, 22 in the testing group), of which 20 were positive for cancer recurrence. Seven models (AUC; F-1 score) were generated, including clinical features only (0.55; 0.52), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) only (0.64; 0.61), pathological images only (0.64; 0.61), MRI plus pathology (0.68; 0.65), MRI plus clinical (0.78, 0.75), pathology plus clinical (0.77; 0.73), and a combination of clinical, MRI, and pathology features (0.87; 0.84). The final combined model showed 80 % recall and 89 % precision. The total accuracy of the implemented model was 82 %. CONCLUSION We validated that the deep learning model combining clinical features and multi-scale histopathologic and radiomic image features can be used to discover risk factors for recurrence beyond tumor size and biomarker analysis. Such a predictive, convergent AI model has the potential to alter the LT allocation system for HCC patients and expand the transplantation treatment option to patients with HCC of the highest tumor burden.","He, Tiancheng; Fong, Joy Nolte; Moore, Linda W; Ezeana, Chika F; Victor, David; Divatia, Mukul; Vasquez, Matthew; Ghobrial, R Mark; Wong, Stephen T C",Computerized medical imaging and graphics : the official journal of the Computerized Medical Imaging Society,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.compmedimag.2021.101894; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33725579/,450

METHODS We conducted a systematic literature search in selected databases (PubMed, WHO COVID-19), preprint servers (medRxiv, bioRxiv) and websites of European Public Health institutes. Documents that compared influenza estimates in the 2019/2020 season with previous seasons were included. Information synthesis was qualitative due to a high heterogeneity in the number and periods of comparative seasons, outcome measures and statistical methods. RESULTS We included 23 records reporting from 15 countries/regions as well as 8 reports from European Public Health agencies. Estimates in the 2019/2020 season based on influenza virus tests (4 out of 7 countries/regions), defined influenza cases (8 out of 9), influenza positivity rate (7 out of 8), and severe complications (1 out of 2) were lower than in former seasons. Results from syndromic indicators, such as influenza-like-illness (ILI), were less clear or even raised (4 out of 7) after the influenza season indicating a misclassification with COVID-19 cases. CONCLUSIONS Evidence synthesis suggests that NPIs targeted at SARS-CoV-2-transmission reduce influenza burden as well. Low threshold NPIs need to be more strongly emphasized in influenza prevention strategies.","Fricke, Lara Marleen; Glöckner, Stephan; Dreier, Maren; Lange, Berit",The Journal of infection,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jinf.2020.11.039; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33278399/,450

In contrast to conventional immunosuppressive treatments, tolerogenic immunotherapy leverages the cells and function of the immune system to quell the autoreactive lymphocytes responsible for damage and disease. The principle techniques of isolating and reprogramming dendritic cells (DCs), central to this approach, are well characterized. However, the broader application of this technology is limited by its high cost and bespoke nature. Nanomedicine offers an alternative route by performing this reprogramming process in situ. Here, we review the challenges and opportunities in using nanoparticles as a delivery mechanism to target DCs and induce immunomodulation, emphasizing their versatility. We then highlight their potential to solve critical problems in organ transplantation and increasingly prevalent autoimmune disorders such as type 1 diabetes mellitus and multiple sclerosis, where new immunotherapy approaches have begun to show promise.","Cifuentes-Rius, Anna; Desai, Anal; Yuen, Daniel; Johnston, Angus P R; Voelcker, Nicolas H",Nature nanotechnology,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41565-020-00810-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33349685/,450

The natural history of untreated or unrevascularized large vessel occlusions in acute stroke patients results in mortality rates approaching 30%, with only 25% achieving good neurologic outcomes at 90 days. Recently, data have demonstrated that early endovascular recanalization of large vessel occlusions results in better outcomes than medical therapy alone. However, the majority of patients in these studies were treated with a stent retriever based approach. The purpose of COMPASS is to evaluate whether patients treated with a direct aspiration first pass (ADAPT) approach have non-inferior functional outcomes to those treated with a stent retriever as the firstline (SRFL) approach. MATERIALS AND METHODS All patients who meet the inclusion and exclusion criteria and consent to participate will be enrolled at participating centers. Treatment will be randomly assigned by a central web based system in a 1:1 manner to treatment with either ADAPT or SRFL thrombectomy. Statistical methodology is prespecified with details available in the statistical analysis plan. RESULTS The trial recently completed enrollment, and data collection/verification is ongoing. The final results will be made available on completion of enrollment and follow-up. CONCLUSIONS This paper details the design of the COMPASS trial, a randomized, blinded adjudicator, concurrent, controlled trial of patients treated with either ADAPT or SRFL approaches in order to evaluate whether ADAPT results in non-inferior functional outcome.

Inspired by processes encountered in nature, where insects and animals often rely on strain and temperature to alter the optical appearance of dispersed liquid crystalline elements, chiral droplets are dispersed in polymer films and deformation induced by uniaxial or biaxial stretching. Our measurements are interpreted by resorting to simulations of the corresponding systems, thereby providing an in-depth understanding of the morphologies that arise in these materials.

Our aim is to access the effect of kidney allografts with MRA on donor and recipient outcomes after pure retroperitoneoscopic live donor nephrectomy (RPLDN). METHODS From July 2001 to August 2010, 533 patients underwent live donor kidney transplants with allografts procured by RPLDN at our center. Of these 533 transplants, 406, 105, and 22 patients had one, two, and three renal arteries, respectively. We compared the retrospectively collected clinical data of each donor with MRA and the recipient using those with single renal artery as controls. RESULTS Significant differences were found among the one-renal artery and three-renal artery groups regarding operative time, estimated blood loss, warm and cold ischemic time, and incidence of slow graft function (SGF). However, there was no significant difference regarding patient and graft survival among the three groups. Major complications, such as open conversion, bleeding, and blood transfusion, were not found in patients with MRA. Five ureteral complications occurred. Of these, there was one patient with MRA. In univariate analysis, MRA patients had a risk factor of developing SGF (P=0.005) but not ureteral complications following RPLDN. CONCLUSION Kidneys with MRA after RPLDN increase the risk of SGF in recipients. However, they provide similar outcomes as to long-term graft survival and complications compared with those of single renal artery. Renal artery multiplicity should not be a contraindication for live kidney donation and may not increase the risk of ureteral complications.","Omoto, Kazuya; Nozaki, Taiji; Inui, Masashi; Hirai, Toshihito; Sawada, Yugo; Shimizu, Tomokazu; Toki, Daisuke; Ishida, Hideki; Tanabe, Kazunari",Transplantation,https://doi.org/10.1097/tp.0000000000000326; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25054809/,450

A fourth patient remained negative at repeated testing; mother, father and sister had a documented mild COVID-19. Non-acral lesions were observed in four older patients, with severe COVID-19. Chilblain-like lesions may be the sole manifestation of SARS-CoV-2 infection; their presence in asymptomatic school children and adolescents should be considered a potential signal of familial or community spread of the virus.","Brancaccio, G; Gussetti, N; Sasset, L; Alaibac, M; Tarantello, M; Salmaso, R; Trevenzoli, M; Cattelan, A M",Pathogens and global health,https://doi.org/10.1080/20477724.2021.1901040; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33729097/,450

Methods Patients were identified through an electronic medical record review from April 15, 2020, until July 1, 2020, at a large safety-net hospital in Boston, MA, caring primarily for underserved, low-income, and elderly patients. All hospitalized adult patients with positive nasopharyngeal swab or respiratory PCR testing for SARS-CoV-2 during their hospitalization or in the 30 days before admission who received an inpatient neurologic or neurocritical care consultation or admission during the study period were enrolled. Results Seventy-four patients were identified (42/57% male, median age 64 years). The majority of patients self-identified as Black or African American (38, 51%). The most common neurologic symptoms at presentation to the hospital included altered mental status (39, 53%), fatigue (18, 24%), and headache (18, 18%). Fifteen patients had ischemic strokes (20%). There were 10 in-hospital mortalities, with moderately severe disability among survivors at discharge (14%, median modified Rankin Scale score of 4). Conclusions Neurologic findings spanned inflammatory, vascular pathologies, sequelae of critical illness and metabolic derangements, possible direct involvement of the nervous system by SARS-CoV-2, and exacerbation of underlying neurologic conditions, highlighting a broad range of possible etiologies of neurologic complications in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Further studies are needed to characterize the infectious and postinfectious neurologic complications of COVID-19 in diverse patient populations.","Anand, Pria; Zhou, Lan; Bhadelia, Nahid; Hamer, Davidson H; Greer, David M; Cervantes-Arslanian, Anna M",Neurology.

Intense macrophage inflammatory activity results in microcalcifications which are strongly associated with plaque vulnerability. Microcalcifications with specific critical size between 5 and 65 μ, located in the fibrous cap producing local mechanical stress on the plaque surface and may directly contribute to plaque rupture. Hence, accurate assessment of microcalcifications size and dimension has significant clinical importance. Current invasive and noninvasive plaque imaging has limited spatial resolution which limits accurate definition of microcalcifications in the atherosclerotic plaques. We describe a new imaging technique with high spatial resolution, based on confocal microscopic analysis, using a dedicated software which allows automatic characterization of microcalcifications and quantitative assessment of their extent and localization.","Danial, John S H; Murad, Fabronia; Saez, Ana-J Garcia; Moawad, Magdy R; Urrico, Giovanni S; Vancheri, Federico; Henein, Michael Y",Angiology,https://doi.org/10.1177/0003319720939466; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32633543/,450

The anatomical, physiological, and behavioural similarities between humans and mammals have prompted researchers to study cerebral mechanisms at different levels to develop and test new treatments. The vast majority of biomedical research uses rodent models, which are easily manipulable and have a broadly resembling organisation to the human nervous system but cannot satisfactorily mimic some disorders. For these disorders, macaque monkeys have been used as they have a more comparable central nervous system. Still, this research has been hampered by limitations, including high costs and reduced samples. This review argues that a squirrel monkey model might bridge the gap by complementing translational research from rodents, macaque, and humans. With the advent of promising new methods such as ultrasound imaging, tool miniaturisation, and a shift towards open science, the squirrel monkey represents a window of opportunity that will potentially fuel new translational discoveries in the diagnosis and treatment of brain pathologies.","Royo, Julie; Forkel, Stephanie J; Pouget, Pierre; Thiebaut de Schotten, Michel",Neuroscience and biobehavioral reviews,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neubiorev.2021.06.006; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34118293/,450
88489,"Podcasts in plastic surgery, why we should start listening.",2020-12-26,"OPINION STATEMENT Urgent reperfusion of the ischaemic brain is the aim of stroke treatment, and the last two decades have seen a rapid advancement in the medical and endovascular treatment of acute ischaemic stroke. Intravenous tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) was first introduced as a safe and effective thrombolytic agent followed by the introduction of newer thrombolytic agents as well as anticoagulant and antiplatelet agents, proposed as potentially safer drugs with more favourable interaction profiles. In addition to chemo-thrombolysis, other techniques including transcranial sonothrombolysis and microbubble cavitation have been introduced which are showing promising results, but await large-scale clinical trials. These developments in medical therapies which are undoubtedly of great importance due to their potential widespread and immediate availability are paralleled with gradual but steady improvements in endovascular recanalisation techniques which were initiated by the introduction of the MERCI (Mechanical Embolus Removal in Cerebral Ischemia) and Penumbra systems. The introduction of the Solitaire device was a significant achievement in reliable and safe endovascular recanalisation and was followed by further innovative stent retrievers. Initial trials failed to show a solid benefit in endovascular intervention compared with IV-tPA alone. These counterintuitive results did not last long, however, when a series of very well-designed randomised controlled trials, pioneered by MR-CLEAN, EXTEND-IA and ESCAPE, emerged, confirming the well-believed daily anecdotal evidence. There have now been seven positive trials of endovascular treatment for acute ischaemic stroke. Now that level I evidence regarding the superiority of endovascular recanalisation is abundantly available, the clinical challenge is how to select patients suitable for intervention and to familiarise and educate stroke care providers with this recent development in stroke care. It is important for the interventional services to be provided only in comprehensive stroke centres and endovascular interventions attempted by experienced well-trained operators, at this stage as an adjunct to the established medical treatment of IV-tPA, if there are no contraindications.","Asadi, Hamed; Williams, David; Thornton, John",Current treatment options in neurology,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11940-016-0403-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27017832/,450

C57BL/6 mice were injected intramuscularly with an anti-SARS-CoV DNA vaccine admixed with a lipid-derived conjugate of 4-1BBL, a potential CD8(+) T-cell co-stimulator. The inclusion of the lipidated co-stimulator greatly enhanced cellular immune responses, especially the CTL response, induced by the DNA vaccine. The adjuvant effect of 4-1BBL was lipidation-dependent, indicating that it functions as a cell membrane-anchored co-stimulator.

However, there has been such phenomenon that high temperature in summer restricts the process of aquaculture. To explore the adaptive capacity of G. blodgettii and G. lemaneiformis, we experimented them and cultured for 12 days under three temperatures (20, 25, and 30 °C) and three levels of multiple nitrogen sources (0.12, 0.6 and 4.4 mg L-1). Their growth, photosynthetic characteristics, and biochemical compositions including the contents of pigments and soluble protein were determined to investigate the single and interactive effects of temperatures and nitrogen levels on these two species. The results showed that in terms of G. blodgettii, the higher growth rate and more pigment (chlorophyll a and carotenoids) contents were observed at 25 and 30 °C in comparison to 20 °C, and the pigments showed maximum contents at 25 °C. More nitrogen improved the growth rate, net photosynthetic rate (Pn) at 25 and 30 °C, Fv/Fm at 20 °C, maximal photosynthetic electron transfer rate (ETRm), as well as soluble protein content at 20 and 25 °C. Additionally, the growth rate, Pn, and ETRm of G. lemaneiformis all showed a decline as increasing temperature; analogously high nitrogen concentration increased the growth rate at 25 and 30 °C, Fv/Fm at each temperature, ETRm, and pigments contents at 20 °C, as well as soluble protein content at 20 and 25 °C. Conclusions indicated that high temperature restricted the growth rate, inhibited photosynthetic characteristics, and decreased the soluble protein content of G. lemaneiformis. The reduced photosynthetic performance, pigments, and soluble protein contents of G. blodgettii were noted under similar conditions. However, nitrogen enrichment induced the greater resistant level to high temperature, and G. blodgettii showed better response. These findings suggested that these two Gracilaria species possessed a certain adaptability to tail water from aquaculture at high temperature and G. blodgettii can resist more to. Therefore, it seems to be an alternative and workable scheme to adopt some suitable macroalgae to optimize the solution to present purification of aquaculture wastewater or eutrophic waters under high temperature.","Ma, Chen; Qin, Song; Cui, Hongli; Liu, Zhengyi; Zhuang, Longchuan; Wang, Yong; Zhong, Zhihai",Environmental science and pollution research international,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11356-020-11969-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33411287/,450

This paper focuses on issues of supportive care in the context of the pandemic, and the extent to which these issues will impact supportive cancer care post-COVID-19. RECENT FINDINGS Cancer care, including supportive care delivery, has had to be dramatically altered during the COVID-19 pandemic, including reallocation of human resources, repurposing of existing physical space, amplified use of telehealth and other remote patient monitoring technologies, changes to treatment and follow-up care patient schedules, among others. These changes have resulted in psychosocial sequelae for cancer patients (including anxiety, stress, loss of control), financial toxicity, and risk of disengagement from treatment and follow-up care. SUMMARY COVID-19 has seriously disrupted cancer treatment and supportive care for patients and survivors.

92200,"Re: ""COVID-19 Recommendations From Ophthalmic and Plastic Reconstructive Surgery Societies Worldwide"".",2020,"BACKGROUND Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) is the second leading cause of early onset dementia following Alzheimer's disease. It involves atrophy of the frontal and temporal regions of the brain affecting language, memory, and behavior. Transactive response DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43) pathology is found in most FTD and ALS cases. It plays a role in transcription, translation and serves as a shuttle between the nucleus and cytoplasm. Prior to its aggregation, TDP-43 exists as polyubiquitinated, hyperphosphorylated C-terminal fragments that correlate well with FTD disease progression. Because of the importance of TDP-43 in these diseases, reagents that can selectively recognize specific toxic TDP variants associated with onset and progression of FTD can be effective diagnostic and therapeutic tools. RESULTS We utilized a novel atomic force microscopy (AFM) based biopanning protocol to isolate single chain variable fragments (scFvs) from a phage display library that selectively bind TDP variants present in human FTD but not cognitively normal age matched brain tissue. We then used the scFvs (FTD-TDP1 through 5) to probe post-mortem brain tissue and sera samples for the presence of FTD related TDP variants. The scFvs readily selected the FTD tissue and sera samples over age matched controls. The scFvs were used in immunohistochemical analysis of FTD and control brain slices where the reagents showed strong staining with TDP in FTD brain tissue slice. FTD-TDP1, FTD-TDP2, FTD-TDP4 and FTD-TDP5 all protected neuronal cells against FTD TDP induced toxicity suggesting potential therapeutic value. CONCLUSIONS These results show existence of different disease specific TDP variants in FTD individuals. We have identified a panel of scFvs capable of recognizing these disease specific TDP variants in postmortem FTD tissue and sera samples over age matched controls and can thus serve as a biomarker tool.","Venkataraman, Lalitha; He, Ping; Khan, Galam; Harris, Brent T; Sierks, Michael R",BMC neuroscience,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12868-020-00586-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32887544/,450

There is concern for increased substance use motivated by coping with stress, anxiety, depression, and boredom-all of which may be elevated during the pandemic. The current study examined intraindividual changes (from pre-COVID to during COVID) in young adults' alcohol and marijuana use, perceptions of peers' use (i.e., norms), and motives for use. METHODS A community sample of young adults (N = 572; Mage= 25.14; 60.8% women) was recruited in Washington State. By using a repeated-measures design, data were collected prior to the COVID-19 pandemic (January 2020) and again during the initial acute phase of the pandemic (April/May of 2020). RESULTS Young adults, on average, increased alcohol use frequency but decreased the amount consumed per drinking occasion. No changes in marijuana use were identified. Young adults (on average) perceived that peers had increased the frequency and total amount of alcohol use and perceived that peers were engaging in heavier marijuana use than prior to COVID-19. For alcohol use motives, there was a significant increase in depression coping motives and significant decreases in social, enhancement, and conformity motives. Boredom motives for marijuana use significantly increased, while celebration motives decreased. CONCLUSIONS Using a prospective design with a sample initially recruited in Washington State, these data indicate that (a) young adults' patterns of alcohol use may have changed, (b) young adults tend to think that peers are engaging in heavier alcohol/marijuana use than before the pandemic, and (c) motives for using alcohol/marijuana may have changed during the pandemic.","Graupensperger, Scott; Fleming, Charles B; Jaffe, Anna E; Rhew, Isaac C; Patrick, Megan E; Lee, Christine M",The Journal of adolescent health : official publication of the Society for Adolescent Medicine,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jadohealth.2021.01.008; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33781471/,450
93164,[The COVID-19 Pandemia and its consequences for plastic surgery and hand surgery].,2020-04-28,"Fasting in the Islamic month of Ramadan is obligatory for all sane, healthy adult Muslims. The length of the day varies significantly in temperate regions-typically lasting ≥ 18 h during peak summer in the UK. The synodic nature of the Islamic calendar means that Ramadan migrates across all four seasons over an approximately 33-year cycle. Despite valid exemptions, there is an intense desire to fast during this month, even among those who are considered to be at high risk, including many individuals with diabetes mellitus. In this review we explore the current scientific and clinical evidence on fasting in patients with diabetes mellitus, focussing on type 2 diabetes mellitus and type 1 diabetes mellitus, with brief reviews on pregnancy, pancreatic diabetes, bariatric surgery, the elderly population and current practice guidelines. We also make recommendations on the management of diabetes patients during the month of Ramadan. Many patients admit to a do-it-yourself approach to diabetes mellitus management during Ramadan, largely due to an under-appreciation of the risks and implications of the rigors of fasting on their health. Part of the issue may also lie with a healthcare professional's perceived inability to grasp the religious sensitivities of Muslims in relation to disease management. Thus, the pre-Ramadan assessment is crucial to ensure a safe Ramadan experience. Diabetes patients can be risk-stratified from low, medium to high or very high risk during the pre-Ramadan assessment and counselled accordingly. Those who are assessed to be at high to very high risk are advised not to fast. The current COVID-19 pandemic upgrades those in the high-risk category to very high risk; hence a significant number of diabetes patients may fall under the penumbra of the 'not to fast' advisory. We recognize that fasting is a personal choice and if a person chooses to fast despite advice to the contrary, he/she should be adequately supported and monitored closely during Ramadan and for a brief period thereafter. Current advancements in insulin delivery and glucose monitoring technologies are useful adjuncts to strategies for supporting type 1 diabetes patients considered to be high risk as well as 'high-risk' type 2 patients manage their diabetes during Ramadan. Although there is a lack of formal trial data, there is sufficient evidence across the different classes of therapeutic hypoglycaemic agents in terms of safety and efficacy to enable informed decision-making and provide a breadth of therapeutic options for the patient and the healthcare professional, even if the professional advice is to abstain. Thus, Ramadan provides an excellent opportunity for patient engagement to discuss important aspects of management, to improve control in the short term during Ramadan and to help the observants understand that the metabolic gains achieved during Ramadan are also sustainable in the other months of the year by maintaining a dietary and behavioural discipline. The application of this understanding can potentially prevent long-term complications.

Three patients for bilateral axillary osmidrosis were enrolled. After an incision of about one-third the length of the widest transverse diameter, the apocrine glands were separated from the skin. And then apocrine glands within the marked area were destroyed by irradiation with a 1,444-nm Nd:YAG laser thereafter.

Two intersecting lines were drawn on an axial CT image to define the medial/lateral nature of anterior renal tumors. Patients with antero-lateral tumor and posterior tumor were compared. RESULTS Antero-lateral tumors constituted 56.1% (32/57) of the total cases. The perioperative outcomes between the two groups were comparable. Although the operation time was longer for the antero-lateral tumor group, it did not show statistical significance. No cases had positive margins. There was one case of Clavien-Dindo grade IIIa complication in the antero-lateral tumor group.

Measles infection is an important cause of morbidity and mortality in immunosuppressed children. A suboptimal seroprotection against measles has been shown in immunocompromised children. There is limited published literature on measles immunity in children with difficult-to-treat nephrotic syndrome (DTNS). We compared the proportions of children with DTNS and healthy controls who were seroprotected against measles. METHODS This was a cross-sectional study. Measles-specific IgG antibodies of 108 children with DTNS (3 to 10 years of age) and an equal number of age-matched healthy controls were measured. All children had received two doses of measles-containing vaccine at 9-12 and 16-24 months of age under routine immunisation programme. Serum measles IgG antibody titres were measured by indirect ELISA. The assay results were interpreted as (1) > 11 NTU (NovaTec Units), positive/seroprotective titres; (2) 9-11, equivocal; and (3) < 9 NTU, negative. Inter- and intra-group comparisons were made to identify the disease characteristics related to seroprotection status. RESULTS The proportion of children with protective anti-measles antibodies (n = 70, 65%) was significantly lower in DTNS as compared to controls (n = 88, 81.48%) (p = 0.005). Their median [IQR] antibody titres were also significantly lower than those in controls (14.1 [14] NTU vs. 18.3 [15.2] NTU (p = 0.001).

98965,Comparison of native porcine skin and a dermal substitute using tensiometry and digital image speckle correlation.,2012,"BACKGROUND Triage methods are necessary in emergency departments to provide clinicians with a reliable method for determining each patient's risk of adverse outcome. Prior to the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic the CURB-65 (a risk prediction score for pneumonia, based on confusion, urea level, respiratory rate, blood pressure and age over 65 years) pneumonia score and the Pandemic Modified Early Warning Score (PMEWS) were used to assess adults. In response to the emergence of the pandemic, national guidance produced a new swine flu hospital pathway for use adults and children. However, none of these methods had been widely validated or tested in the setting of pandemic influenza. OBJECTIVES To use the initial waves of the 2009 H1N1 pandemic to evaluate existing triage methods in patients presenting with suspected pandemic influenza, and to determine whether an improved triage method could be developed. METHODS A prospective cohort study was undertaken of patients with suspected swine flu presenting to four hospitals during the second wave of the 2009 H1N1 pandemic. Staff completed a standardised assessment form that included the CURB-65 score, PMEWS and the swine flu hospital pathway. Patients who died or required respiratory, cardiovascular or renal support during the 30-day follow-up were defined as having a poor outcome. Patients who survived to 30 days without requiring respiratory, cardiovascular or renal support were defined as having a good outcome. RESULTS Data were collected and analysed from 481 cases across three hospitals. Most of the cases were children, with 347 out of 481 (72%) aged 16 years or less. There were five poor outcomes: two deaths and three survivors who required respiratory support. The five patients with poor outcomes had CURB-65 scores of zero, one (three cases) and two, and PMEWS scores of one, five, six, seven and eight. The swine flu hospital pathway was positive in three out of five cases. The C-statistic for each method was CURB-65 0.78 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.58 to 0.99], PMEWS 0.77 (95% CI 0.55 to 0.99) and the swine flu hospital pathway 0.70 (95% CI 0.45 to 0.96). Patients with a higher CURB-65 score were more likely to be admitted (p < 0.001): 25 out of 101 (25%) with a score of zero, 11 out of 24 (46%) with a score of one, 7 out of 8 (88%) with a score of two, and the patient with a score of three were admitted. Admitted patients had a higher mean PMEWS score (4.6 vs 2.0, p < 0.001). The C-statistics for CURB-65, PMEWS and the swine flu hospital pathway in adults in terms of discriminating between those admitted and discharged were 0.65 (95% CI 0.54 to 0.76), 0.76 (95% CI 0.66 to 0.86) and 0.62 (95% CI 0.51 to 0.72) respectively. LIMITATIONS The 2009 H1N1 pandemic was much smaller and less severe than predicted and resulted in a lack of sufficient data. CONCLUSIONS Potential concerns were raised about the use of existing triage methods for patients with suspected pandemic influenza, as these methods may fail to discriminate between patients who will have an adverse outcome and those with a benign course. Clinicians in the study did not generally appear to admit or discharge on the basis of these methods, despite their recommended use. Further research is required to evaluate existing triage methods and develop new triage tools for suspected pandemic influenza.","Goodacre, S; Challen, K; Wilson, R; Campbell, M",Health technology assessment,https://doi.org/10.3310/hta14460-03; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20923612/,450
100183,Complication Rate of Prepectoral Implant-based Breast Reconstruction Using Human Acellular Dermal Matrices.,2020-12-01,"PURPOSE Describe the development, delivery, acceptability and evaluation of a modular training programme for community-based, non-medical practitioners monitoring patients with quiescent neovascular age related macular degeneration (QnAMD). Also, report on a qualitative process evaluation conducted during the pilot phase of a randomised control trial (the FENETRE Study) exploring patient and practitioner acceptability of community-based QnAMD care relative to hospital-based care. METHODS Learning outcomes from The College of Optometrists' Medical Retina higher qualifications and the Royal College of Ophthalmologists' Common Clinical Competency Framework were used to develop a competency framework for QnAMD care. Training was delivered online, comprising six asynchronous lectures followed by two synchronous case-based discussion webinars, with an accredited assessment of 24 case vignettes. An anonymous evaluation survey was conducted with the first two FENETRE cohorts (n = 38). Separately, we undertook a qualitative process evaluation, sampling purposively in four hospitals and five community-based practices, interviewing nine patients and eight practitioners. RESULTS Survey responses (n = 26) showed community optometrists were very satisfied (n = 12; 46%) or satisfied (n = 14; 54%) with the training; feedback reflected by qualitative process evaluation data. Overall, optometrists also felt either confident (n = 15; 58%) or very confident (n = 8; 31%) in conducting AMD monitoring appointments following training, a finding also corroborated by interview data from optometrists participating in the initial pilot phase roll-out. Optometrists identified patient convenience and alleviating pressures in hospital care as the primary reasons for acceptability of community pathways. Data from patients entering community practices suggested they largely found this at least as safe and convenient as hospital care, although some patients randomised to hospital care perceived that as safer. CONCLUSION This pilot study has shown the development and implementation of a collaborative community monitoring model is feasible, with satisfaction from community optometrists for training and accreditation, and broad acceptance for the pathway by both patients and practitioners.","Read, Simon; Lawrenson, John G; Harper, Robert A; Hanley, Thomas; Balaskas, Konstantinos; Waterman, Heather",Ophthalmic & physiological optics : the journal of the British College of Ophthalmic Opticians,https://doi.org/10.1111/opo.12836; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34036613/,450

The protease exhibits a typical chymotrypsin fold with a Cys...His...Glu catalytic triad; its three-dimensional structure is closely related to that of the 3C(pro) of rhinovirus 2, as well as to that of poliovirus. The phylogenetic position of the EV68 3C(pro) between the corresponding enzymes of rhinoviruses on the one hand and classical enteroviruses on the other prompted us to use the crystal structure for the design of irreversible inhibitors, with the goal of discovering broad-spectrum antiviral compounds. We synthesized a series of peptidic α,β-unsaturated ethyl esters of increasing length and for each inhibitor candidate, we determined a crystal structure of its complex with the EV68 3C(pro), which served as the basis for the next design round. To exhibit inhibitory activity, compounds must span at least P3 to P1'; the most potent inhibitors comprise P4 to P1'. Inhibitory activities were found against the purified 3C protease of EV68, as well as with replicons for poliovirus and EV71 (50% effective concentration [EC(50)] = 0.5 μM for the best compound). Antiviral activities were determined using cell cultures infected with EV71, poliovirus, echovirus 11, and various rhinovirus serotypes. The most potent inhibitor, SG85, exhibited activity with EC(50)s of ≈180 nM against EV71 and ≈60 nM against human rhinovirus 14 in a live virus-cell-based assay. Even the shorter SG75, spanning only P3 to P1', displayed significant activity (EC(50) = 2 to 5 μM) against various rhinoviruses.","Tan, Jinzhi; George, Shyla; Kusov, Yuri; Perbandt, Markus; Anemüller, Stefan; Mesters, Jeroen R; Norder, Helene; Coutard, Bruno; Lacroix, Céline; Leyssen, Pieter; Neyts, Johan; Hilgenfeld, Rolf",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.01123-12; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23388726/,450

102670,Reconstructing the extended nasal tip defect.,2013,"The regeneration of filtering facepiece respirators (FFRs) is of critical importance because of the severe shortage of FFRs during large-scale outbreaks of respiratory epidemics, such as COVID-19. Comprehensive experiments regarding FFR regeneration were performed in this study with model bacteria to illustrate the decontamination performance of the regeneration processes. The results showed that it is dangerous to use a contaminated FFR without any microbe inactivation treatment because the bacteria can live for more than 8 hours. The filtration efficiency and surface electrostatic potential of 75% ethanol-treated FFRs were significantly reduced, and a most penetrating particle size of 200 nm was observed. Steam and microwave irradiation showed promising decontamination performances, achieving 100% inactivation in 90 min and 30 min, respectively. The filtration efficiencies of steam-treated FFRs for 50 and 100 nm particles decreased from 98.86% and 99.51% to 97.58% and 98.79%, respectively. Ultraviolet irradiation (UVI) effectively inactivated the surface bacteria with a short treatment of 5 min and did not affect the filtration performance. However, the UV dose reaching different layers of the FFP2 mask sample gradually decreased from the outermost layer to the innermost layer, while the model bacteria on the second and third layers could not be killed completely. UVI+MWI and steam were recommended to effectively decontaminate the used respirators and still maintain the respirators' filtration efficiency. The present work provides a comprehensive evaluation for FFR regeneration in terms of the filtration efficiencies for 50-500 nm particles, the electrostatic properties, mechanical properties and decontamination effects.","He, Weidong; Guo, Yinghe; Gao, Hanchao; Liu, Jingxian; Yue, Yang; Wang, Jing",ACS nano,https://doi.org/10.1021/acsnano.0c04782; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32975412/,450

It also examines how personal experience, interpersonal communication, traditional and Internet-based media, and self-efficacy affect perception at four levels, as well as the self-other differences between the personal level and each of the other three levels. An online survey in both countries reveals an ""ascending pattern,"" showing higher perceived risk for others than for selves. Chinese respondents perceive higher risk than U.S. respondents at all levels. Interpersonal communication predicts risk perception at four levels in the United States and at the group and societal levels in China. New media exposure exerts influence on all but the group level in China, while social networking sites (SNS) exposure predicts group- and societal-level risk perception in the United States. The overall attention paid to H1N1 information in the media affects all levels in both countries. Interaction between media exposure and attention is influential at all levels in the United States. Self-efficacy is negatively associated with risk perception in China except at the global level. Attention to media in the United States, and SNS exposure in China, explain the self-other differences in three comparisons, along with self-efficacy, which decreases the self-other gap in the United States while increasing the gap in China.","Han, Gang Kevin; Zhang, Jueman Mandy; Chu, Kejun Rebecca; Shen, Guolin",Health communication,https://doi.org/10.1080/10410236.2012.723267; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23421413/,450

The aim of this study was to evaluate the role of endoscopy during LRYGB surgery in assessing the gastric pouch and anastomosis for air leak, bleeding, and structure at the beginning of a bariatric surgery program. Patients who underwent LRYGB for morbid obesity between May 2008 and May 2009 were included in this study. After the completion of the anastomosis, an endoscopic examination was carried out. The transection line and anastomosis site were examined for bleeding and patency and inspected for air leak under laparoscopic vision. Thirteen morbidly obese patients (mean body mass index, 48.0 ± 6.8 kg/m(2)) were evaluated by endoscopic examination during the LRYGB operation. None of the cases had bleeding at the transection line or anastomosis site. In two patients, air leak test was positive and the anastomosis was reinforced with additional sutures. All the patients, including those with positive air leak test, were discharged from the hospital with no leak complications. After a mean follow-up of 9.1 ± 5.5 months, except for the patient who underwent balloon dilatation, no other patient had anastomotic stricture. Intraoperative endoscopy is invaluable in the assessment of bleeding, anastomotic patency, and air leak during LRYGB, and it might be a helpful auxiliary tool to decrease morbidity during the learning curve period. Also, it helps solve intraoperative problems during the surgery so that postoperative complications might be prevented.","Cingi, Asım; Yavuz, Yunus",Obesity surgery,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11695-011-0355-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21229330/,450
103720,"Successes, revisions, and postoperative complications in 446 Mohs defect repairs.",2012,"INTRODUCTION The objective was to compare the impact of three assistance levels of different modes of mechanical ventilation; neurally adjusted ventilatory assist (NAVA), proportional assist ventilation (PAV), and pressure support ventilation (PSV) on major features of patient-ventilator interaction. METHODS PSV, NAVA, and PAV were set to obtain a tidal volume (VT) of 6 to 8 ml/kg (PSV₁₀₀, NAVA₁₀₀, and PAV₁₀₀) in 16 intubated patients. Assistance was further decreased by 50% (PSV₅₀, NAVA₅₀, and PAV₅₀) and then increased by 50% (PSV₁₅₀, NAVA₁₅₀, and PAV₁₅₀) with all modes. The three modes were randomly applied. Airway flow and pressure, electrical activity of the diaphragm (EAdi), and blood gases were measured. VT, peak EAdi, coefficient of variation of VT and EAdi, and the prevalence of the main patient-ventilator asynchronies were calculated. RESULTS PAV and NAVA prevented the increase of VT with high levels of assistance (median 7.4 (interquartile range (IQR) 5.7 to 10.1) ml/kg and 7.4 (IQR, 5.9 to 10.5) ml/kg with PAV₁₅₀ and NAVA₁₅₀ versus 10.9 (IQR, 8.9 to 12.0) ml/kg with PSV₁₅₀, P <0.05). EAdi was higher with PAV than with PSV at level₁₀₀ and level₁₅₀. The coefficient of variation of VT was higher with NAVA and PAV (19 (IQR, 14 to 31)% and 21 (IQR 16 to 29)% with NAVA₁₀₀ and PAV₁₀₀ versus 13 (IQR 11 to 18)% with PSV₁₀₀, P <0.05). The prevalence of ineffective triggering was lower with PAV and NAVA than with PSV (P <0.05), but the prevalence of double triggering was higher with NAVA than with PAV and PSV (P <0.05). CONCLUSIONS PAV and NAVA both prevent overdistention, improve neuromechanical coupling, restore the variability of the breathing pattern, and decrease patient-ventilator asynchrony in fairly similar ways compared with PSV. Further studies are needed to evaluate the possible clinical benefits of NAVA and PAV on clinical outcomes. TRIAL REGISTRATION Clinicaltrials.gov NCT02056093 .

Blockage of complement, apoptosis, and inflammation is considered a strategy for attenuating ischemia-reperfusion injury and protecting cardiac function. Minipig donor hearts were perfused and preserved in Celsior solution or transfection reagent containing Celsior solution with scramble siRNA or siRNAs targeting complement 3, caspase-8, caspase-3, and nuclear factor κB-p65 genes at 4°C and subsequently hemo-reperfused ex vivo (38°C) or transplanted into recipients. The protective effect of the siRNA solution was evaluated by measuring cell apoptosis, structural alteration, protein markers for tissue damage and oxidative stress, and cardiac function. We found a reduction in cell apoptosis, myocardial damage, and tissue inflammation by reduced biochemistry and markers and protein expression of proinflammatory cytokines and improvement in cardiac function, as shown by the improved hemodynamic indices in 12-hr-preserved siRNA-treated hearts of both ex vivo and orthotopic transplantation models. These findings demonstrate that blockade of inflammation and apoptosis pathways using siRNA can prolong cold preservation time and better protect donor heart function in cardiac transplantation of large animals, which may be beneficial for human heart preservation.","Wei, Jia; Chen, Shiyou; Xue, Song; Zhu, Qiangru; Liu, Sha; Cui, Li; Hua, Xiuguo; Wang, Yongyi",Molecular therapy.

The disease presentation varies from asymptomatic/mild cases to severe and fatal cases. The source of the virus has focused on bats and dromedary camels but the exact mode of disease transmission continues to be debated. Current data indicate that the virus spreads from human to human through droplet and contact routes, while performing aerosole-generating procedures predispose to airborne transmission. The best diagnostic tests rely on the identification of MERS-CoV by PCR, and lower respiratory tract samples should be favoured for the diagnosis whenever this is possible in order to avoid false negative results.

The performance of the system was evaluated on 800 new fundus photographs (400 normal optic discs, 201 papilledema [disc edema from elevated intracranial pressure], 199 other optic disc abnormalities) and compared with that of two expert neuro-ophthalmologists who independently reviewed the same randomly-presented images without clinical information. Area-under-the-receiver-operating-characteristic-curve, accuracy, sensitivity and specificity were calculated. RESULTS The system correctly classified 678/800 (84.7%) photographs, compared with 675/800 (84.4%) for Expert 1 and 641/800 (80.1%) for Expert 2. The system yielded area-under-the-receiver-operating-characteristic-curves of 0.97 (CI 95%, 0.96 - 0.98), 0.96 (CI 95%, 0.94 - 0.97) and 0.89 (CI 95%, 0.87 - 0.92) for the detection of normal discs, papilledema and other disc abnormalities, respectively.

108755,A barbed suture repair for flexor tendons: a novel technique with no exposed barbs.,2014,"INTRODUCTION Endoscopic ultrasound-guided gallbladder drainage (EUS-GBD) is an alternative treatment option for patients with acute cholecystitis, especially for those who are unsuitable for cholecystectomy. Recently used luminal apposing metal stents (LAMS) in EUS-GBD has several advantages over standard metal stents. However, there is no current guideline on where to locate the LAMS when transgastric approach is required. This study reports a case of gastric outlet obstruction (GOO) by placing LAMS too close to the pyloric ring. PATIENT CONCERNS A 79-year-old female patient was referred to our department for evaluation of a large hepatic mass on abdominal ultrasound. Abdominal pain on right upper quadrant and spiking fever up to 38 °C appeared after liver biopsy. Abdominal ultrasound showed thickened GB wall and positive sonographic Murphy sign. DIAGNOSES Intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma with multiple lung and intrahepatic metastasis, acute cholecystitis, and pyloric ring obstruction caused by flange of LAMS in EUS-GBD. INTERVENTIONS EUS-GBD via transgastric approach was performed with LAMS. After complete deployment of stent, esophagogastroduodenoscopy showed complete GOO by flange of LAMS. A gastroduodenal metal stent was inserted to relieve the GOO. OUTCOMES The patient recovered well. She did not complain about obstruction induced symptom such as vomiting or abdominal fullness after gastroduodenal stent insertion. CONCLUSION To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case report of EUS-GBD induced GOO. If physicians use LAMS as a transgastric approach in EUS-GBD, the puncture site should be carefully selected considering the size of the flange.","Seo, Seung Young; Lee, Chang Hun; Kim, In Hee; Kim, Sang Wook; Lee, Seung Ok; Lee, Soo Teik; Kim, Seong-Hun",Medicine,https://doi.org/10.1097/md.0000000000021017; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32629723/,450

109540,Protecting Your Reconstructive Plastic Surgery Practice in a Pandemic: Five Ways to Mitigate this Unique Environment.,2020-04-30,"OBJECTIVES This document aimed to summarise the key components of exertional heat stroke (EHS) prehospital management. METHODS Members of the International Olympic Committee Adverse Weather Impact Expert Working Group for the Olympic Games Tokyo 2020 summarised the current best practice regarding the EHS prehospital management. RESULTS Sports competitions that are scheduled under high environmental heat stress or those that include events with high metabolic demands should implement and adopt policy and procedures for EHS prehospital management. The basic principles of EHS prehospital care are: early recognition, early diagnosis, rapid, on-site cooling and advanced clinical care. In order to achieve these principles, medical organisers must establish an area called the heat deck within or adjacent to the main medical tent that is optimised for EHS diagnosis, treatment and monitoring. Once admitted to the heat deck, the rectal temperature of the athlete with suspected EHS is assessed to confirm an elevated core body temperature. After EHS is diagnosed, the athlete must be cooled on-site until the rectal temperature is below 39°C. While cooling the athlete, medical providers are recommended to conduct a blood analysis to rule out exercise-associated hyponatraemia or hypoglycaemia, provided that this can be safely performed without interrupting cooling. The athlete is transported to advanced care for a full medical evaluation only after the treatment has been provided on-site. CONCLUSIONS A coordination of care among all medical stakeholders at the sports venue, during transport, and at the hospital is warranted to ensure effective management is provided to the EHS athlete.","Hosokawa, Yuri; Racinais, Sebastien; Akama, Takao; Zideman, David; Budgett, Richard; Casa, Douglas J; Bermon, Stéphane; Grundstein, Andrew J; Pitsiladis, Yannis P; Schobersberger, Wolfgang; Yamasawa, Fumihiro",British journal of sports medicine,https://doi.org/10.1136/bjsports-2020-103854; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33888465/,450

There is emerging concern that unfavorable arterial collateralization, though unproven, predetermines poor outcome. We hypothesized that poor leptomeningeal collateralization, assessed by preprocedural CTA, is associated with poor outcome in patients with acute ischemic stroke undergoing intra-arterial therapy. MATERIALS AND METHODS We retrospectively analyzed patients with acute ischemic stroke with intracranial ICA and/or MCA occlusions who received intra-arterial therapy. The collaterals were graded on CTA. Univariate and multivariate analyses were used to investigate the association between the dichotomized leptomeningeal collateral score and functional outcomes at 3-months mRS ≤2, mortality, and intracranial hemorrhages. RESULTS Eighty-seven patients were included. The median age was 66 years (interquartile range, 54-76 years) and the median NIHSS score at admission was 18 (interquartile range, 14-20). The leptomeningeal collateral score 3 was found to have significant association with the good functional outcome at 3 months: OR = 3.13; 95% CI, 1.25-7.825; P = .016. This association remained significant when adjusted for the use of IV tissue plasminogen activator: alone, OR = 2.998; 95% CI, 1.154-7.786; P = .024; and for IV tissue plasminogen activator and other confounders (age, baseline NIHSS score, and Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction grades), OR = 2.985; 95% CI, 1.027-8.673; P = .045. CONCLUSIONS We found that poor arterial collateralization, defined as a collateral score of <3, was associated with poor outcome, after adjustment for recanalization success. We recommend that future studies include collateral scores as one of the predictors of functional outcome.","Seeta Ramaiah, S; Churilov, L; Mitchell, P; Dowling, R; Yan, B",AJNR.

112903,"CT appearance of severe, laboratory-proven coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in a Caucasian patient in Berlin, Germany.",2020-03-19,"PURPOSE Physical impairment after critical illness is recognized as a part of the post-intensive care syndrome (PICS). About one third of intensive care unit (ICU) survivors suffer from long-term physical disability, yet the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms remains poorly understood. The pro-inflammatory alarmin, high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1), promotes muscle dysfunction in experimental models, and HMGB1 stays elevated in some patients after ICU discharge. Accordingly, we investigated the relationship between HMGB1 plasma levels and physical performance in ICU survivors. METHODS Prospective cohort study of 100 ICU survivors from the general ICU at the Karolinska University Hospital, Sweden. Patients returned for follow up at three (58 patients) and six months (51 patients) after ICU discharge. Blood samples were collected, and a 6-min walk test (6-MWT), a handgrip-strength test (HST), and a timed-stands test (TST) performed. RESULTS Compared to reference values of the different physical tests, 16% of patients underperformed at all tests at three months and 12% at six months. All test results, except hand-grip strength left, improved significantly over the follow-up period (p < 0.05). There was no significant association between plasma HMGB1 levels at three and six months and scores on the three tests (6-MWT, TST, HST) (p = 0.50 - 0.69). CONCLUSION In this follow-up study of ICU survivors, we found no significant association between plasma HMGB1 levels and physical performance. Additional follow-up studies of HMGB1 plasma levels and muscle function in ICU survivors are still warranted.","Brück, Emily; Svensson-Raskh, Anna; Larsson, Jacob W; Caravaca, April S; Gallina, Alessandro L; Michael, Eberhardson; Sackey, Peter V; Olofsson, Peder S",Acta anaesthesiologica Scandinavica,https://doi.org/10.1111/aas.13815; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33725363/,450

Transplanted children shift their primary disease to a chronic condition of immunosuppression to avoid rejection. Longer life expectancy in children poses a greater risk of prolonged and severe side effects related to long-term immunosuppressive (IS) disabilities and secondary cancer susceptibility. The goal remains to find the best combination of IS agents that optimises allograft survival by preventing acute rejection while limiting drug toxicities. This systematic review will aim to determine the optimal IS strategy within the so-called minimisation, conversion or withdrawal strategies.

We will include controlled and uncontrolled clinical trials along with any prospective or retrospective study that includes a universal cohort (all participants from a centre/region/city over a certain period). Cases series and cross-sectional studies are excluded. Two review authors will independently assess the trial eligibility, risk of bias and extract appropriate data points.

He was found to have right acute dacryoadenitis based on clinical examination and orbital imaging. One day after initiation of oral antibiotic and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory therapy, he developed worsening of the orbital inflammation and partial ophthalmoplegia. Oral steroids were commenced resulting in rapid resolution of symptoms within a few days and clinical stability at 2 months. The patient did not have any systemic features of COVID-19 but he was in close contact with his mother and with his partner who both had respiratory symptoms and tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 antigen (PCR testing) 4 weeks prior. PCR testing from nasopharyngeal swab was negative for SARS-CoV-2 RNA; however, the serological test was positive for IgM/IgG SARS-CoV-2 antibodies.

121895,The free descending branch muscle-sparing latissimus dorsi flap: vascular anatomy and clinical applications.,2012,"BACKGROUND Exception from informed consent (EFIC) regulations for research in emergency settings contain unique requirements for community consultation and public disclosure. These requirements address ethical challenges intrinsic to this research context. Multiple approaches have evolved to accomplish these activities that may reflect and advance different aims. This scoping review was designed to identify areas of consensus and lingering uncertainty in the literature. METHODS Scoping review methodology was used. Conceptual and empirical literature related to community consultation and public disclosure for EFIC research was included and identified through a structured search using EMBASE, HEIN Online, PubMed, and Web of Science. Data were extracted using a standardized tool with domains for major literature categories. RESULTS Among 84 manuscripts, major domains included: conceptual or policy issues; reports of community consultation processes and results; and reports of public disclosure processes and results. Areas of consensus related to community consultation included the need for a two-way exchange of information and use of multiple methods. Public acceptance of personal EFIC enrollment is commonly 64-85%. There is less consensus regarding how to assess attitudes, what ""communities"" to prioritize, and how to determine adequacy for individual projects. Core goals of public disclosure are less well-developed, no metrics exist for assessing adequacy. CONCLUSIONS Multiple methods are used to meet community consultation and public disclosure requirements. There remain no settled norms for assessing adequacy of public disclosure, and there is lingering debate about needed breadth and depth of community consultation.","Dickert, Neal W; Metz, Kathleen; Fetters, Michael D; Haggins, Adrianne N; Harney, Deneil K; Speight, Candace D; Silbergleit, Robert",Academic emergency medicine : official journal of the Society for Academic Emergency Medicine,https://doi.org/10.1111/acem.14264; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33872426/,450

This is especially true when the landing zone for a balloon-tipped guiding catheter (BGC) at the bulb portion is insufficient. Sequential application of the balloons of a BGC and an angioplasty catheter may prevent thromboembolism during revascularization. This study analyzed the safety and effectiveness of this relay-balloon technique. METHODS Ten consecutive patients with acute symptomatic proximal ICA occlusion were treated by the relay-balloon technique. Outcomes analyzed included technical success rate, procedure-related complications, and short-term clinical outcomes. RESULTS Successful revascularization was achieved in all 10 patients. One patient experienced a post-procedural infarct extension, but there was no change in National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score. Mean NIHSS score decreased from 12.0±5.6 (range 0-18) initially to 6.8±5.4 (range 0-18) at discharge. CONCLUSIONS The relay-balloon technique is safe and effective in the endovascular revascularization of acute symptomatic proximal ICA occlusions, which are at high risk of distal thromboembolism due to insufficient landing zone for the BGC.","Lee, Sang Hun; Lee, Dong Geun; Kwon, Sun U; Lee, Deok Hee",Journal of neurointerventional surgery,https://doi.org/10.1136/neurintsurg-2016-012900; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28108499/,450
127082,Evidence-Based Wound Irrigation: Separating Fact from Fiction.,2021-08-20,"INTRODUCTION Clearance of damaged cells and debris is beneficial for the functional recovery after ischemic brain injury. However, the specific phagocytic receptor that mediates microglial phagocytosis after ischemic stroke is unknown. AIM To investigate whether P2Y6 receptor-mediated microglial phagocytosis is beneficial for the debris clearance and functional recovery after ischemic stroke. RESULTS The expression of the P2Y6 receptor in microglia increased within 3 days after transient middle cerebral artery occlusion. Inhibition of microglial phagocytosis by the selective inhibitor MRS2578 enlarged the brain atrophy and edema volume after ischemic stroke, subsequently aggravated neurological function as measured by modified neurological severity scores and Grid walking test. MRS2578 treatment had no effect on the expression of IL-1α, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-10, TNF-α, TGF-β, and MPO after ischemic stroke. Finally, we found that the expression of myosin light chain kinase decreased after microglial phagocytosis inhibition in the ischemic mouse brain, which suggested that myosin light chain kinase was involved in P2Y6 receptor-mediated phagocytosis. CONCLUSION Our results indicate that P2Y6 receptor-mediated microglial phagocytosis plays a beneficial role during the acute stage of ischemic stroke, which can be a therapeutic target for ischemic stroke.","Wen, Ruo-Xue; Shen, Hui; Huang, Shu-Xian; Wang, Li-Ping; Li, Zong-Wei; Peng, Peng; Mamtilahun, Muyassar; Tang, Yao-Hui; Shen, Fan-Xia; Tian, Heng-Li; Yang, Guo-Yuan; Zhang, Zhi-Jun",CNS neuroscience & therapeutics,https://doi.org/10.1111/cns.13296; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32154670/,450
128446,The Use of a Mechanical Stapler in Jejunal Free Flaps in Laryngopharyngectomy Defects.,2015,"The first case of COVID-19 in Japan was reported on 16 January 2020. The total number of the infected has reached 313,844 and the number of deaths has reached 4,379 as of 16 January 2021. This article reviews the characteristics of and responses to the three waves of COVID-19 in Japan during 2020-2021 in order to provide a reference for the next step in epidemic prevention and control. The Japanese Government declared a state of emergency on 7 April 2020, which suppressed the increase in the number of the infected by curtailing economic activity. The first wave peaked at 701 new cases a day and it decreased to 21 new cases on May 25 when the state of emergency was lifted. However, the number of the infected increased again due to the resumption of economic activity, with a peak of 1,762 new cases a day during the second wave. Although the situation was worse than that during the first wave, the government succeeded in limiting the increase without declaring a state of emergency again, and that may be attributed to a decrease in crowd activities and an increase in the number of inspections. During the third wave, the number of the infected continued to exceed the peak during previous waves for two months. Major factors for this rise include the government's implementation of further policies to encourage certain activities, relaxed immigration restrictions, and people not reducing their level of activity. An even more serious problem is the bed usage for patients with COVID-19; bed usage exceeds 50% not only in major cities but also in various areas. On 7 January 2021, 5,953 new cases were reported a day; this greatly exceeded the previous peak, and the state of emergency was declared again. Although Japan has been preparing its medical system since the first wave, maintaining that system has imposed a large economic burden on medical facilities, hence stronger measures and additional support are urgently needed to combat COVID-19 in the coming few months.","Karako, Kenji; Song, Peipei; Chen, Yu; Tang, Wei; Kokudo, Norihiro",Bioscience trends,https://doi.org/10.5582/bst.2021.01019; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33518668/,450

Previous research established reference hematology values, a proxy of individual health, of muskrats occurring in highly modified ecosystems. However, our knowledge of hematology metrics in muskrat populations occurring in more natural ecosystems is limited. We measured several hematological parameters of wild-caught muskrats (n = 73) in the Greater Voyageurs Ecosystem in northern Minnesota in 2018-2019 to establish baseline muskrat health in a relatively intact, near-pristine ecosystem. Additionally, we measured rectal temperature and heart and respiratory rates and collected whole blood for complete blood cell count assessment. We established baseline physiologic and hematologic reference ranges for the population and describe variations between total white blood cells, nucleated cell differentials, and basic erythron and platelet estimates and demonstrate methods of estimation to be poor proxies for more standardized counting methods. Our results establish a baseline to compare muskrat health assessments for populations affected by landscape change or in decline.","Aarrestad, Olivia; Matykiewicz, Benjamin R; Windels, Steve K; Ahlers, Adam A; Olson, Bryce T; Rendahl, Aaron; Burton, Erin N; Wolf, Tiffany M",Journal of zoo and wildlife medicine : official publication of the American Association of Zoo Veterinarians,https://doi.org/10.1638/2020-0108; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34130413/,450

Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) is a commonly performed, effective bariatric procedure; however, rarely, complications such as postprandial hypoglycemia due to noninsulinoma pancreatogenous hypoglycemia syndrome (NIPHS) may ensue. Management of refractory NIPHS is challenging. We report a case that was successfully treated with RYGB reversal. Case Report. A 58-year-old male with history of RYGB nine months earlier for morbid obesity presented for evaluation of postprandial, hypoglycemic seizures. Testing for insulin level, insulin antibodies, oral hypoglycemic agents, pituitary axis hormone levels, and cortisol stimulation was unrevealing. Computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen was unremarkable. A 72-hour fast was completed without hypoglycemia. Mixed meal testing demonstrated endogenous hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia (EHH) and selective arterial calcium stimulation testing (SACST) was positive. Strict dietary modifications, maximal medical therapy, gastrostomy tube feeding, and stomal reduction failed to alleviate symptoms. Ultimately, he underwent laparoscopic reversal of RYGB. Now, 9 months after reversal, he has markedly reduced hypoglycemia burden. Discussion. Hyperfunctioning islets secondary to exaggerated incretin response and altered intestinal nutrient delivery are hypothesized to be causative in NIPHS. For refractory cases, there is increasing skepticism about the safety and efficacy of pancreatic resection.

When the acquired plasmids were transfected into Vero cells, expression and distribution of the EGFP-fused full-length ORF3 protein and its truncated forms in the cells were observed by laser confocal microscopy. The results showed that ORF3 protein or their truncated forms containing 40-91 aa segment including two transmembrane domains were localized in the cytoplasm, whereas ORF3 truncated peptides without the 40-91 aa segment were distributed in the whole cell (in both cytoplasm and nucleus). This suggests that the 40-91 aa is the key structural domain determining cytoplasmic location of PEDV ORF3 protein.

133321,Telemedicine in Oculoplastics: The Real-Life Application of Video Consultation Clinics.,2020-11-04,"BACKGROUND Interventions aimed at modifying behavior for promoting health and disease management are traditionally resource intensive and difficult to scale. Mobile health apps are being used for these purposes; however, their effects on health outcomes have been mixed. OBJECTIVE This study aims to summarize the evidence of rigorously evaluated health-related apps on health outcomes and explore the effects of features present in studies that reported a statistically significant difference in health outcomes. METHODS A literature search was conducted in 7 databases (MEDLINE, Scopus, PsycINFO, CINAHL, Global Index Medicus, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews). A total of 5 reviewers independently screened and extracted the study characteristics. We used a random-effects model to calculate the pooled effect size estimates for meta-analysis. Sensitivity analysis was conducted based on follow-up time, stand-alone app interventions, level of personalization, and pilot studies. Logistic regression was used to examine the structure of app features. RESULTS From the database searches, 8230 records were initially identified. Of these, 172 met the inclusion criteria. Studies were predominantly conducted in high-income countries (164/172, 94.3%). The majority had follow-up periods of 6 months or less (143/172, 83.1%). Over half of the interventions were delivered by a stand-alone app (106/172, 61.6%). Static/one-size-fits-all (97/172, 56.4%) was the most common level of personalization. Intervention frequency was daily or more frequent for the majority of the studies (123/172, 71.5%). A total of 156 studies involving 21,422 participants reported continuous health outcome data. The use of an app to modify behavior (either as a stand-alone or as part of a larger intervention) confers a slight/weak advantage over standard care in health interventions (standardized mean difference=0.38 [95% CI 0.31-0.45]; I2=80%), although heterogeneity was high. CONCLUSIONS The evidence in the literature demonstrates a steady increase in the rigorous evaluation of apps aimed at modifying behavior to promote health and manage disease. Although the literature is growing, the evidence that apps can improve health outcomes is weak. This finding may reflect the need for improved methodological and evaluative approaches to the development and assessment of health care improvement apps.

Data dashboards for drug value assessments can draw from other contexts. Decision makers should be presented with well-designed value dashboards containing various metrics, including conventional cost per quality-adjusted life-year ratios as well as measures of a drug's impact on clinical and patient-centric outcomes, and on budgetary and distributional consequences, to convey a drug's value along different dimensions.

Despite uncertainty, infection prevention principles and experience with similar diseases have helped guide how to best protect providers and patients against disease acquisition. RECENT FINDINGS Guidance to date has relied on data from SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV to guide practices on patient isolation and personal protective equipment (PPE) use. Although a face mask and eye protection are likely adequate for most clinical scenarios, published guidelines for PPE can be confusing and conflicting. Consensus for what constitutes a high-risk aerosol-generating procedure (AGP) is lacking, but most agree providers performing procedures such as bronchoscopy, intubation, and cardiopulmonary resuscitation would likely benefit from the use of an N95 respirator and eye protection. SUMMARY Needed research to elucidate the predominant SARS-CoV-2 mode of transmission is not likely to be completed in the immediate future. Recommendations for PPE to mitigate procedure-associated risk remain controversial. Nonetheless, implementation of existing measures based on basic infection prevention principles is likely to prevent transmission significantly.","Scaggs Huang, Felicia; Schaffzin, Joshua K",Current opinion in pediatrics,https://doi.org/10.1097/mop.0000000000000973; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33315687/,450
135580,"""Telemedicine & Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery: Lessons from the COVID-19 Pandemic and Directions for the Future.""",2020-07-21,"Introduction: Heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (heFH) is associated with a very high risk for cardiovascular events. Treatment with potent statins substantially reduces cardiovascular morbidity in these patients. Moreover, combination therapy with statins plus ezetimibe and/or proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) inhibitors facilitates achievement of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) targets in patients with heFH. However, heFH remains underdiagnosed and undertreated worldwide.Areas covered: In this review, we summarize current evidence on the prevalence and control rates of heFH. Accumulating data suggest that heFH is one of the most common hereditary metabolic disorders, affecting approximately 1 in every 300 individuals. However, only a small minority of patients with heFH achieve LDL-C targets, even in high-income countries and in subjects followed-up in specialized lipid clinics.Expert opinion: Given the underdiagnosis of heFH using cascade and opportunistic screening, wider, population-based screening strategies should be evaluated for their feasibility and cost-effectiveness if we aspire to timely diagnosis and therefore prevention of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in this very high risk population. Overcoming inertia in uptitrating statin dose, adding ezetimibe and/or PCSK9 inhibitors along with more generous reimbursement for lipid-lowering agents in patients with heFH are essential for improving goal attainment rates.","Polychronopoulos, Georgios; Tzavelas, Marios; Tziomalos, Konstantinos",Expert review of endocrinology & metabolism,https://doi.org/10.1080/17446651.2021.1929175; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33993819/,450

Tissue-engineered vascular grafts (TEVG) have been suggested as an alternative, but the ideal TEVG remains to be generated, and a systematic overview and meta-analysis of clinically relevant studies is lacking. We systematically searched PubMed and Embase databases for (pre)clinical trials and identified three clinical and 68 preclinical trials ([>rabbit]; 873 TEVGs) meeting the inclusion criteria. Preclinical trials represented low to medium risk of bias, and binary logistic regression revealed that patency was significantly affected by recellularization, TEVG length, TEVG diameter, surface modification, and preconditioning. In contrast, scaffold types were less important. The patency was 63.5%, 89%, and 100% for TEVGs with a median diameter of 3 mm, 4 mm, and 5 mm, respectively. In the group of recellularized TEVGs, patency was not improved by using smooth muscle cells in addition to endothelial cells nor affected by the endothelial origin, but seems to benefit from a long-term (46-240 hours) recellularization time. Finally, data showed that median TEVG length (5 cm) and median follow-up (56 days) used in preclinical settings are relatively inadequate for direct clinical translation. In conclusion, our data imply that future studies should consider a TEVG design that at least includes endothelial recellularization and bioreactor preconditioning, and we suggest that more standard guidelines for testing and reporting TEVGs in large animals should be considered to enable interstudy comparisons and favor a robust and reproducible outcome as well as clinical translation.","Skovrind, Ida; Harvald, Eva Bang; Juul Belling, Helene; Jørgensen, Christian Damsgaard; Lindholt, Jes Sanddal; Andersen, Ditte Caroline",Stem cells translational medicine,https://doi.org/10.1002/sctm.18-0287; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30920771/,450
137014,Acute Febrile Neutrophilic Dermatosis after Deep Inferior Epigastric Perforator Flap Breast Reconstruction.,2016,"In this article, we demonstrate a statistical method for fitting the parameters of a sophisticated network and epidemic model to disease data. The pattern of contacts between hosts is described by a class of dyadic independence exponential-family random graph models (ERGMs), whereas the transmission process that runs over the network is modeled as a stochastic susceptible-exposed-infectious-removed (SEIR) epidemic. We fit these models to very detailed data from the 1861 measles outbreak in Hagelloch, Germany. The network models include parameters for all recorded host covariates including age, sex, household, and classroom membership and household location whereas the SEIR epidemic model has exponentially distributed transmission times with gamma-distributed latent and infective periods. This approach allows us to make meaningful statements about the structure of the population-separate from the transmission process-as well as to provide estimates of various biological quantities of interest, such as the effective reproductive number, R. Using reversible jump Markov chain Monte Carlo, we produce samples from the joint posterior distribution of all the parameters of this model-the network, transmission tree, network parameters, and SEIR parameters-and perform Bayesian model selection to find the best-fitting network model. We compare our results with those of previous analyses and show that the ERGM network model better fits the data than a Bernoulli network model previously used. We also provide a software package, written in R, that performs this type of analysis.","Groendyke, Chris; Welch, David; Hunter, David R",Biometrics,https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1541-0420.2012.01748.x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22364540/,450

We aimed to determine whether DCC compared to immediate cord clamping (ICC) in very preterm infants improves cerebral oxygenation in the first 24 h. STUDY DESIGN This is a prospective study of a subset of infants at < 30 weeks of gestation who were randomised to DCC (≥60 s) or ICC (< 10 s) and required an indwelling arterial catheter. Regional cerebral oxygenation (rScO2), blood pressure, PI, and peripheral saturation were measured and cerebral fractional tissue oxygen extraction (cFTOE) calculated for the following 3 time intervals: 3-6, 6-12, and 12-28 h of age. Functional ultrasound measures including superior vena cava flow, right ventricular output, ductus arteriosus size and shunt and anterior cerebral artery resistive index were determined. RESULTS The mean (±SD) gestation and birth weight of the 51 study infants were 27 ± 1 weeks and 1,046 ± 241 g respectively. Twenty infants received DCC and 31 received ICC. Baseline demographics were similar between the 2 groups. Comparing DCC and ICC infants, there was no difference in rScO2 or cFTOE at any time point. Three out of 20 infants did not receive DCC due to clinical concerns. A sensitivity analysis revealed that cord clamping ≥30 s was significantly associated with increased rScO2 and decreased cFTOE at all 3 time points after adjusting for gestation. CONCLUSION Although DCC was not associated with changes in cerebral oxygenation overall, sensitivity analysis suggested a possible effect of an increased rScO2 and a decreased cFTOE with ≥30 s of DCC.","Popat, Himanshu; Galea, Claire; Evans, Nicholas; Lingwood, Barbara; Colditz, Paul B; Halliday, Robert; Osborn, David",Neonatology,https://doi.org/10.1159/000492712; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30199867/,450

METHODS We assessed the use of a specific remote structured interview that validated the diagnosis, level of treatment resistance, and depression severity. The objectives were to (1) assess the rate at which patients who were deemed eligible for participation in trials by site investigators were ineligible, (2) assess the reasons for ineligibility, (3) compare rates of ineligibility between academic and nonacademic sites, (4) compare eligibility between US and non-US sites, and (5) report the placebo response rates in trials utilizing this quality assurance approach, comparing its placebo response rates with those reported in the literature. Methods included a pooled analysis of 9 studies that utilized this methodology (SAFER interviews). RESULTS Overall, 15.33% of patients who had been deemed eligible at research sites were not eligible after the structured interviews. The most common reason was that patients did not meet the study requirements for level of treatment resistance. Pass rates were significantly higher at non-US compared with US sites (94.6% vs 83.3%, respectively; P < 0.001). There was not a significant difference between academic and nonacademic sites (87.8% vs 82.4%; P = 0.08). Placebo response rates were 13.0% to 27.3%, below the 30% to 40% average in antidepressant clinical trials, suggesting a benefit of the quality assurance provided by these interviews. CONCLUSIONS The use of a remotely structured interview by experienced clinical researchers was feasible and possibly contributed to lower-than-average placebo response rates.

Coupled ECG-electromagnetic (EM) guidance shows promise for use in placement of peripherally inserted central catheters (PICCs) when compared with the classic blind technique. However, ECG-EM guidance has not been appropriately compared with the reference standard of fluoroscopy (FX) guidance. Here, we aimed to compare ECG-EM guidance with FX guidance with regard to the final tip position of PICCs. SUBJECTS AND METHODS. A total of 120 patients (age range, 19-94 years) referred for PICC placement were randomized to the ECG-EM or FX group. All interventions were performed by PICC team members who had the same standardized training and experience. Final tip position was assessed using chest radiography and was classified as optimal, suboptimal, or inadequate requiring repositioning on the basis of the distance from the PICC tip to the cavoatrial junction (CAJ). Statistical analyses were performed using the Mann-Whitney U test for final catheter tip position (mean distance from CAJ) and Fisher and chi-square tests for proportions. RESULTS. PICCs were successfully inserted in 118 patients (53 men and 65 women). Catheter tip positions were optimal or suboptimal in 100% of the FX group and 77.2% of the ECG-EM group. Furthermore, precision of placement was significantly better (p = .004) in the FX group (mean distance from the PICC tip to the CAJ = 0.83 cm) than in the ECGEM group (mean distance from the PICC tip to the CAJ = 1.37 cm). Thirteen (22.8%) of the PICCs placed using ECG-EM guidance, all of which were inserted from the left side, were qualified as inadequate requiring repositioning and required another intervention. CONCLUSION. Our results revealed significant differences in final tip position between the ECG-EM and FX guidance techniques and indicate that ECG-EM guidance cannot appropriately replace FX guidance among unselected patients. However, ECGEM guidance could be considered as an acceptable technique for patients in whom the PICC could be inserted from the right side. TRIAL REGISTRATION.

Here we describe a case of AIHA, refractory to both standard and experimental therapies, complicated by multiorgan failure, and rapidly leading to death. CASE REPORT AND RESULTS A 65 year-old man who presented with progressive dyspnea and jaundice was found to have hemolytic anemia. Diagnostic work-up revealed a positive direct antiglobulin test and a strong pan-reactive antibody in the plasma reacting to a titer of 1:1024 with strongest reactivity at 37 °C Coombs' phase with reagent anti-IgG. The red cell eluate contained a pan-agglutinin. The patient received multiple lines of treatment including glucocorticoids, intravenous immunoglobulin, rituximab, eculizumab, splenectomy and etoposide. Despite these interventions, he continued to experience brisk hemolysis and remained transfusion dependent. Repeat testing on day 16 demonstrated persistent high titer IgG auto-antibodies, suggesting minimal suppressive effect of therapy. His course was complicated by acute renal and liver failure, venous thrombosis, and worsening coagulopathy, and he ultimately died from multiorgan failure on day 18. CONCLUSION Severe cases of AIHA can result in multiorgan failure and a fatal outcome. The rapid development of liver failure in this setting has been described in only few case reports to date, and represents an important complication for clinicians to be aware of when treating patients with AIHA.","Anandappa, Annabelle J; Stefely, Jonathan A; Hasserjian, Robert P; Dzik, Walter H; Waheed, Anem",Transfusion,https://doi.org/10.1111/trf.16513; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34046911/,450

We evaluated the incidence and severity of coughing in adults who received a subhypnotic dose of propofol at the end of sevoflurane-remifentanil anesthesia. METHODS Sixty patients, aged 18-65 years, undergoing elective nasal surgery under general anesthesia using sevoflurane and remifentanil were randomly allocated to the propofol group (n = 30) or the control group (n = 30). At the end of surgery, sevoflurane and remifentanil infusion was stopped. After 3 min, the propofol group received propofol 0.3 mg/kg and the control group received normal saline 0.03 ml/kg. The incidence and severity of cough, recovery time and hemodynamic parameters were evaluated during the emergence period. RESULTS During emergence, the propofol group had the significantly lower incidence (60 vs. 87%) and severity of coughing compared with the control group (P = 0.04, P = 0.02, respectively). There were no significant differences in mean arterial pressure, heart rate, and recovery time during emergence between the two groups.

153457,Porous Versus Nonporous Orbital Implants After Enucleation for Uveal Melanoma: A Randomized Study.,2017,"Streptococcus pyogenes (Group A Streptococcus, GAS), a major human-specific pathogen, relies on efficient nutrient acquisition for successful infection within its host. The phosphotransferase system (PTS) couples the import of carbohydrates with their phosphorylation prior to metabolism and has been linked to GAS pathogenesis. In a screen of an insertional mutant library of all 14 annotated PTS permease (EIIC) genes in MGAS5005, the annotated ß-glucoside PTS transporter (bglP) was found crucial for GAS growth and survival in human blood and was validated in another M1T1 GAS strain, 5448. In 5448, bglP was shown to be in an operon with a putative phospho-ß-glucosidase (bglB) downstream and a predicted antiterminator (licT) upstream. Using defined non-polar mutants of the ß-glucoside permease (bglP) and ß-glucosidase enzyme (bglB) in 5448, we showed that bglB, not bglP, was important for growth in blood. Furthermore, transcription of the licT/blgPB operon was found to be repressed by glucose and induced by the ß-glucoside salicin as the sole carbon source. Investigation of the individual bglP and bglB mutants determined that they influence in vitro growth in the ß-glucoside salicin; however, only bglP was necessary for growth in other non-ß-glucoside PTS sugars such as fructose and mannose. Additionally, loss of BglP and BglB suggests they are important for the regulation of virulence-related genes that control biofilm formation, SLS-mediated hemolysis, and localized ulcerative lesion progression during subcutaneous infections in mice. Thus, our results indicate that the ß-glucoside PTS transports salicin and its metabolism can differentially influence GAS pathophysiology during soft tissue infection.","Braza, Rezia Era; Silver, Aliyah B; Sundar, Ganesh S; Davis, Sarah E; Razi, Afrooz; Islam, Emrul; Hart, Meaghan; Zhu, Jinyi; Le Breton, Yoann; McIver, Kevin S",Infection and immunity,https://doi.org/10.1128/iai.00346-20; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32719156/,450

In this context, retinal services are exploring novel ways to ensure access to healthcare. METHODS We conducted a worldwide survey among retinal specialists between March 31, 2020 and April 12, 2020. The expert survey was developed on the basis of focus group discussions involving retinal specialists and literature searches. It included 44 questions on alternative ways of care provision including digital health domains such as teleophthalmology, home monitoring or decentralised patient care. RESULTS 214 retinal experts participated in the survey, of which 120 (56.1%) had more than 15 years of experience in ophthalmology. Most participants were clinicians (n=158, 73.9%) practising in Western Europe (n=159, 74%). In the majority of institutions, teleophthalmology, home monitoring and decentralised patient care have not been implemented before the pandemic (n=46, 21.8.1%; n=64, 29.9%; n=38, 19.1%).

157195,Medical abortion is an essential service during the pandemic.,2021-04-01,"INTRODUCTION Distance or remote cognitive assessments, administered via phone or computer platforms, have emerged as possible alternatives to traditional assessments performed during office visits. Distance refers to any nontraditional assessment feature, not only or necessarily location. We conducted a systematic review to examine the psychometric soundness of these approaches. METHOD We searched PubMed, PsycINFO, AgeLine, and Academic Search Premier for articles published between January 2008 and June 2020. Studies were included if participants were over the age of 50, a structured assessment of cognitive function in older adults was evaluated, the assessment method was deemed distant, and validity and/or reliability data were reported. Assessment distance was defined as having any of the following features: use of an electronic test interface, nonroutine test location (e.g., home), test self-administered, and test unsupervised. Distance was categorized as low, intermediate, or high. RESULTS/DISCUSSION Twenty-six studies met inclusion criteria. Sample sizes ranged from n = 8 to 8,627, and the mean age ranged from 57 to 83. Assessments included screens, brief or full batteries, and were performed via videoconferencing, phone, smartphone, or tablet/computer. Ten studies reported on low distance, 11 on intermediate distance, and 5 studies for high distance assessments. Invalid performance data were observed with older age and cognitive impairment. Convergent validity data were reported consistently and suggested a decline with increasing distance: r = 0.52-0.80 for low, 0.49-0.75 for intermediate, and 0.41-0.53 for high distance. Diagnostic validity estimates presented a similar pattern. Reliability data were reported too inconsistently to allow evaluation. CONCLUSION The validity of cognitive assessments with older adults appears supported at lower but not higher distance. Less is known about the reliability of such assessments. Future research should delineate the person and procedure boundaries for valid and reliable test results.","Binng, Davina; Splonskowski, Moriah; Jacova, Claudia",Dementia and geriatric cognitive disorders,https://doi.org/10.1159/000511945; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33291097/,450
157897,Crisis Leadership.,2020-12-01,"INTRODUCTION We developed the iTrainer (iT) as a portable laparoscopic trainer, which incorporates the iPad tablet. We then compared the iT with a standard pelvic trainer (SPT) to assess surgical skills as well as its image quality, resolution, brightness, comfort, and overall performance. MATERIALS AND METHODS We designed and constructed the iT to be compatible with the Apple iPad 3 and standard laparoscopic instruments. Participants were assigned to perform the thread-the-loops task on both trainers and were prospectively randomized to start on either the iT or the SPT. Each participant was allowed a 2-minute warm-up before the 2-minute testing period. We scored participants using the product of skill quality (0-4 scale) and quantity of loops threaded (0-10 scale). Participants then rated each trainer on image quality, resolution, brightness, comfort, and overall performance on a 5-point Likert scale. RESULTS A total of 45 subjects including 10 undergraduates, 10 medical students, 10 general surgery and urology residents, and 15 experts (fellows and attending surgeons) participated in this study. There was no significant difference between thread-the-loops task scores completed on the iT when compared with the SPT for all groups tested (p > 0.05) with the exception of the medical student group, who performed better on the SPT (p < 0.05). On evaluation of each trainer, participants rated the iT as having superior image quality and resolution when compared with the SPT (p < 0.05) but rated the SPT higher in overall performance (p < 0.05). Brightness and comfort were rated similarly for both trainers. CONCLUSIONS We have demonstrated face validity and criterion validity for the thread-the-loops task on the iT. The iT rated superior in image quality and resolution but inferior in overall performance compared with the SPT. The iT provides trainees a unique advantage over SPT as an additional resource to laparoscopic training as it is inexpensive, portable, and can be readily available for training.","Yoon, Renai; Del Junco, Michael; Kaplan, Adam; Okhunov, Zhamshid; Bucur, Philip; Hofmann, Martin; Alipanah, Reza; McDougall, Elspeth M; Landman, Jaime",Journal of surgical education,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jsurg.2014.06.011; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25052844/,450
158622,Piezo-Assisted Turbinoplasty: A Novel Rapid and Safe Technique.,2019-12-31,"BACKGROUND Obesity-associated hyperlipidemia and hyperlipoproteinemia are risk factors for cardiovascular disease (CVD). Recently, ceramide-derived sphingolipids were identified as a novel independent CVD risk factor. We hypothesized that the beneficial effect of Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) on CVD risk is related to ceramide-mediated improvement in lipoprotein profile. METHODS A prospective study of patients undergoing RYGB was conducted. The patients' clinical data and biochemical markers related to cardiovascular risk were documented. Plasma ceramide subspecies (C14:0, C16:0, C18:0, C18:1, C20:0, C24:0, and C24:1), apolipoprotein (Apo)B100 and ApoA1 were quantified preoperatively and 3 and 6 months after RYGB, as was the Framingham risk score. Brachial artery reactivity testing was performed before and 6 months after RYGB. RESULTS Ten patients (9 women; age 48.6 ± 9.6 yr; body mass index, 48.5 ± 5.8 kg/m(2)) were included in the present study. At 6 months postoperatively, the mean body mass index had decreased to 35.7 ± 5.0 kg/m(2), corresponding to 51.3% ± 10.0% excess weight loss. The fasting total cholesterol, triglycerides, low-density lipoprotein, free fatty acids, ApoB100, ApoB100/ApoA1 ratio and insulin resistance estimated from Homeostasis Model of Assessment of Insulin Resistance were significantly reduced compared with the preoperative values. The ApoB100/ApoA1 ratio correlated with a reduction in ceramide subspecies (C18:0, C18:1, C20:0, C24:0, and C24:1; P < .05). ApoB100 and the ApoB100/ApoA1 ratio also correlated positively with the reduction in triglycerides, low-density lipoprotein, and Homeostasis Model of Assessment of Insulin Resistance (P < .05). Brachial artery reactivity testing correlated inversely with ApoB100 and total ceramide (P = .05). Furthermore, the change in brachial artery reactivity testing correlated with the decrease in C16:0 (P < .03). CONCLUSION Our data suggest that improvements in lipid profiles and CVD risk factors after gastric bypass surgery could be linked to changes in ceramide lipids. Mechanistic studies are needed to determine whether this link is causative or purely correlative.","Heneghan, Helen M; Huang, Hazel; Kashyap, Sangeeta R; Gornik, Heather L; McCullough, Arthur J; Schauer, Philip R; Brethauer, Stacy A; Kirwan, John P; Kasumov, Takhar",Surgery for obesity and related diseases : official journal of the American Society for Bariatric Surgery,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.soard.2011.11.018; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22264909/,450
159136,Discussion: Analysis of Alternative Metrics of Research Impact: A Correlation Comparison between Altmetric Attention Scores and Traditional Bibliometrics among Plastic Surgery Research.,2020-11-01,"Importance Postoperative delirium occurs in 10% to 60% of elderly patients having major surgery and is associated with longer hospital stays, increased hospital costs, and 1-year mortality. Emerging literature suggests that dexmedetomidine sedation in critical care units is associated with reduced incidence of delirium. However, intraoperative use of dexmedetomidine for prevention of delirium has not been well studied. Objective To evaluate whether an intraoperative infusion of dexmedetomidine reduces postoperative delirium. Design, Setting, and Participants This study was a multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial that randomly assigned patients to dexmedetomidine or saline placebo infused during surgery and for 2 hours in the recovery room. Patients were assessed daily for postoperative delirium (primary outcome) and secondarily for postoperative cognitive decline. Participants were elderly (>68 years) patients undergoing major elective noncardiac surgery. The study dates were February 2008 to May 2014. Interventions Dexmedetomidine infusion (0.5 µg/kg/h) during surgery and up to 2 hours in the recovery room. Main Outcomes and Measures The primary hypothesis tested was that intraoperative dexmedetomidine administration would reduce postoperative delirium. Secondarily, the study examined the correlation between dexmedetomidine use and postoperative cognitive change. Results In total, 404 patients were randomized; 390 completed in-hospital delirium assessments (median [interquartile range] age, 74.0 [71.0-78.0] years; 51.3% [200 of 390] female). There was no difference in postoperative delirium between the dexmedetomidine and placebo groups (12.2% [23 of 189] vs 11.4% [23 of 201], P = .94). After adjustment for age and educational level, there was no difference in the postoperative cognitive performance between treatment groups at 3 months and 6 months. Adverse events were comparably distributed in the treatment groups. Conclusions and Relevance Intraoperative dexmedetomidine does not prevent postoperative delirium. The reduction in delirium previously demonstrated in numerous surgical intensive care unit studies was not observed, which underscores the importance of timing when administering the drug to prevent delirium.

The study was aimed at analyzing predictors of psychosocial burden among workers during the co-19 pandemic period. A total of 6,053 worker respondents were involved in this study. The psychosocial burden was reviewed based on the worries level. There were 4 independent variables involved in the analysis, including age, gender, marital, and education. A multivariate test was performed using binary logistic regression. The results found that the workers in the ≤ 19 age group were 1.900 times more likely than the≥ 50 age group to experience a psychosocial burden. The workers in the 40-49 age group were 1.523 times more likely than the ≥50 age group. Male workers were 0.693 times more likely than female workers to experience a psychosocial burden. The higher education workers were 0.563 times more likely than workers with secondary education. It could be concluded that the 3 variables were proven as predictors of the psychosocial burden among workers during the COVID-19 pandemic period in Indonesia, namely age, gender, and education.","Megatsari, H.; Laksono, A.

178490,A deep mutational scanning platform to characterize the fitness landscape of anti-CRISPR proteins,2021-08-22,"We report on the population of the 47 compact binary mergers detected with a false-alarm rate 1/yr in the second LIGO--Virgo Gravitational-Wave Transient Catalog, GWTC-2. We observe several characteristics of the merging binary black hole (BBH) population not discernible until now. First, we find that the primary mass spectrum contains structure beyond a power-law with a sharp high-mass cut-off; it is more consistent with a broken power law with a break at $39.7^{+20.3}_{-9.1}\,M_\odot$, or a power law with a Gaussian feature peaking at $33.1^{+4.0}_{-5.6}\,M_\odot$ (90\% credible interval). While the primary mass distribution must extend to $\sim65\,M_\odot$ or beyond, only $2.9^{+3.5}_{1.7}\%$ of systems have primary masses greater than $45\,M_\odot$. Second, we find that a fraction of BBH systems have component spins misaligned with the orbital angular momentum, giving rise to precession of the orbital plane. Moreover, 12% to 44% of BBH systems have spins tilted by more than $90^\circ$, giving rise to a negative effective inspiral spin parameter $\chi_\mathrm{eff}$. Under the assumption that such systems can only be formed by dynamical interactions, we infer that between 25% and 93% of BBH with non-vanishing $|\chi_\mathrm{eff}|>0.01$ are dynamically assembled. Third, we estimate merger rates, finding $\mathcal{R}_\text{BBH} = 23.9^{+14.3}_{8.6}$ Gpc$^{-3}$ yr$^{-1}$ for BBH and $\mathcal{R}_\text{BNS}= 320^{+490}_{-240}$ Gpc$^{-3}$ yr$^{-1}$ for binary neutron stars. We find that the BBH rate likely increases with redshift ($85\%$ credibility), but not faster than the star-formation rate ($86\%$ credibility). Additionally, we examine recent exceptional events in the context of our population models, finding that the asymmetric masses of GW190412 and the high component masses of GW190521 are consistent with our models, but the low secondary mass of GW190814 makes it an outlier.","Collaboration, The LIGO Scientific; Abbott, the Virgo Collaboration R.; Abbott, T.

183926,PEER simplified tool: mask use by the general public and by health care workers.,2020-07-01,"PurposeDespite the critical role given to small independent retailers (SIRs) in the revitalisation of city centres, little knowledge exists about their actual competitive strategies. Existing literature rather is normative, recommending SIRs to focus on customer orientation. Thus, the aim of this study is to identify the types of competitive strategies really adopted by SIRs.Design/methodology/approachThis qualitative study is based on 13 semi-structured interviews of the booksellers, beer and wine merchants we met around Paris (France) in 2018. Data analysis was conducted in two stages: each interview was coded to bring out themes, which were then linked in cognitive maps.FindingsFive types of SIRs' competitive strategies emerged from the study, depending on their main focus of attention. Either SIRs have no weapon to fight against external factors and they suffer competition or they have limited means and focus on their relationship with customers or even they possess a specific resource they can rely on (innovative character, skills, values) to go beyond ordinary customer orientation.Practical implicationsThe typology should be a useful tool for SIRs interested in competitive strategies and for municipalities looking for new insights to succeed in the revitalisation of their city centres.Social implicationsRevitalisation of city centres is a big challenge for many Western cities, especially small- and middle-sized ones.Originality/valueTo the best of our knowledge, the typology that comes from this study is the very first one on SIRs. Theoretically, it may help organise researches on SIRs' competitive strategies. Pragmatically, it provides a better understanding of SIRs' competitive strategies.","Eymas, Fabien Bensebaa Faouzi",International Journal of Retail &amp; Distribution Management,https://doi.org/10.1108/ijrdm-06-2020-0212,450
183960,"Separation of Thoraco-Omphalo-Ischiopagus Conjoined Twins: Surgical Planning, Management, and Outcomes.",2016,"Background Genomic surveillance has shaped our understanding of SARS-CoV-2 variants, which have proliferated globally in 2021. Characterizing global genomic surveillance, sequencing coverage, the extent of publicly available genomic data coupled with traditional epidemiologic data can provide evidence to inform SARS-CoV-2 surveillance and control strategies. Methods We collected country-specific data on SARS-CoV-2 genomic surveillance, sequencing capabilities, public genomic data, and aggregated publicly available variant data. We divided countries into three levels of genomic surveillance and sequencing availability based on predefined criteria. We downloaded the merged and deduplicated SARS-CoV-2 sequences from multiple public repositories, and used different proxies to estimate the sequencing coverage and public availability extent of genomic data, in addition to describing the global dissemination of variants. Findings Since the start of 2021, the COVID-19 global epidemic clearly featured increasing circulation of Alpha, which was rapidly replaced by the Delta variant starting around May 2021 and reaching a global prevalence of 96.6% at the end of July 2021. SARS-CoV-2 genomic surveillance and sequencing availability varied markedly across countries, with 63 countries performing routine genomic surveillance and 79 countries with high availability of SARS-CoV-2 sequencing. Less than 3.5% of confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections were sequenced globally since September 2020, with the lowest sequencing coverage in the WHO regions of Eastern Mediterranean, South East Asia, and Africa. Across different variants, 28-52% of countries with explicit reporting on variants shared less than half of their variant sequences in public repositories. More than 60% of demographic and 95% of clinical data were absent in GISAID metadata accompanying sequences. Interpretation Our findings indicated an urgent need to expand sequencing capacity of virus isolates, enhance the sharing of sequences, the standardization of metadata files, and supportive networks for countries with no sequencing capability.","Chen, Z.; Azman, A.; Chen, X.; Zou, J.; Tian, Y.; Sun, R.; Xu, X.; Wu, Y.; Lu, W.; Ge, S.; Zhao, Z.; Yang, J.; Leung, D.; Domman, D.; Yu, H.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.09.06.21263152v1?rss=1,450
185559,[Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)].,2003,"DNA vaccine evaluation in small animals is hampered by low immunogenicity when the vaccines are delivered using a needle and syringe. To overcome this technical hurdle we tested the possibility that a device developed for human intradermal medicine delivery might be adapted to successfully deliver a DNA vaccine to small animals. The PharmaJet® Tropis device is a FDA 510(k)-cleared disposable syringe, needle-free jet injection device designed to administer medicines to the human dermis in a 0.1 mL volume. Here, we found that hantavirus DNA vaccines administered to Syrian hamsters using Tropis were substantially more immunogenic than the same vaccines delivered by needle/syringe or particle mediated epidermal delivery (gene gun) vaccination. By adjusting how the device was used we could deliver vaccine to either subcutaneous tissues, or through the skin into the muscle. RNA and/or antigen expression was detected in epidermal, subepidermal and fibroblast cells. We directly compared six optimized and non-optimized hantavirus DNA vaccines in hamsters. Optimization, including codon-usage and mRNA stability, did not necessarily result in increased immunogenicity for all vaccines tested; however, optimization of the Andes virus (ANDV) DNA vaccine protected vaccinated hamsters from lethal disease. This is the first time active vaccination with an ANDV DNA vaccine has shown protective efficacy in the hamster model. The adaptation of a human intradermal jet injection device for use as a method of subcutaneous and intramuscular jet injection of DNA vaccines will advance the development of nucleic acid based medical countermeasures for diseases modeled in hamsters.","Brocato, Rebecca L.; Kwilas, Steven A.; Josleyn, Matthew D.; Long, Simon; Zeng, Xiankun; Perley, Casey C.; Principe, Lucia M.; Somerville, Brandon; Cohen, Melanie V.; Hooper, Jay W.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.11.09.374439,450

In addition, tissue samples from 22 lynx submitted in 1999 were analyzed by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to detect nucleic acids specific for viral agents and A. phagocytophila. Except for FPV antibodies in one lynx and A. phagocytophila in four lynx, all serology was negative. All PCR results also were negative.

192011,Why I won't see you on the barricades: Disability and COVID-19.,2020-06-01,"Infections with the SARS-CoV-2 virus are increasing in Hawai'i at alarming rates. In the absence of a SARS-CoV-2 virus vaccine, the options for control include social distancing, improved hygiene, and face mask use. There is evidence that mask use may decrease the rates of viral transmission. The rate of effective face mask use has not yet been established in Hawai'i. The authors performed an observational study at 2 locations in Honolulu and evaluated outdoor face mask use compliance in 200 people. Simultaneous observations were performed in a downtown Honolulu business area and in Waikiki, an area focusing on tourism. Overall, 77% of all subjects used face masks in an appropriate fashion, covering their nose and mouth, while 23% were either incorrectly masked or not masked. The rate of compliance with correct public mask use in downtown Honolulu (88%) was significantly higher than in Waikiki (66%) (P=.0003, Odds Ratio [95% Confidence Interval]=3.78 [1.82, 7.85]) These findings suggest that there are opportunities for improvement in rates of public face mask use and a potential decrease in the spread of COVID-19 in our population. Four proposed actions are suggested, including a reassessment of the face mask exemption requirements, enhanced mask compliance education, non-threatening communication for non-compliance, and centralization of information of the public compliance with face mask use.","Tamamoto, Kasey A; Rousslang, Nikki D; Ahn, Hyeong Jun; Better, Heidi E; Hong, Robert A",Hawai'i journal of health & social welfare,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32914093/,450

A total of 201 splenectomies were performed and clinical and demographic data were retrospectively analyzed. Patients were classified according to the type of operation as LS or OS. The mean age of patients was 45.1 +/- 17.1, and 141 patients were male. Out of 43 LS, 40 were done for hematologic causes, and they had a significantly shorter hospital stay compared to OS for hematologic causes (6.87 +/- 2.2 vs. 9.84 +/- 2.9 days; p = 0.000003) and significantly less requirement for blood transfusion (26.2 +/- 93.4 vs. 132.4 +/- 252.3 mL; p = 0.0152). In the OS group, comparison of patients with trauma and those with hematologic causes showed that significantly more males underwent surgery for trauma causes (35 of 43 vs. 16 of 21), hospital stay was longer (18.9 +/- 27.4 vs. 9.8 +/- 2.9 days) and blood requirement higher (708.1 +/- 603.7 mL vs. 132.4 +/- 252.3 mL; p = 0.0004, p = 0.047 and p = 0.000001, respectively).

Forensic Science is able to do so because it has developed to operate within the reality determined by the Criminal Justice System. Changes that are occurring today seem to upset the relationship between Forensic Sciences and the Criminal Justice System by the creation of communication problems. Examples of these problems exist in the changes occurring in the concept of death made necessary by organ transplants. These changes have shifted the focus from the quantity of life to the quality of life and make it impossible for the Forensic Scientist to answer honestly the questions that might be put him. The need for reforms in the law in view of social changes has been recognized and in many countries attempts at such changes are afoot. With these changes a new reality is being defined. Forensic Science, being a discipline that comes first in contact with a multitude of emergent problems, has a part to play in the definition of this reality.","Jayewardene, C H",Forensic science international,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3338689/,450

196850,Pandemics are not worse than natural disasters.,2020-11-01,"A population genetic survey of over 200 structural loci previously revealed that the South African cheetah (Acinonyx jubatus jubatus) has an extreme paucity of genetic variability, probably as a consequence of a severe population bottleneck in its recent past. The genetic monomorphism of the species is here extended to the major histocompatibility complex, since 14 reciprocal skin grafts between unrelated cheetahs were accepted. The apparent consequences of such genetic uniformity to the species include (i) great difficulty in captive breeding, (ii) a high degree of juvenile mortality in captivity and in the wild, and (iii) a high frequency of spermatozoal abnormalities in ejaculates. The species vulnerability of the cheetah was demonstrated by an epizootic of coronavirus-associated feline infectious peritonitis in an Oregon breeding colony in 1983. Exposure and spread of the coronavirus, which has a very low morbidity in domestic cats (approximately 1 percent), has decimated a heretofore productive and healthy captive population. The extreme genetic monomorphism, especially at the major histocompatibility complex, and the apparent hypersensitivity of the cheetah to a viral pathogen may be related, and provide a biological basis for understanding the adaptive significance of abundant genetic variation in outbred mammalian species.","O'Brien, S J; Roelke, M E; Marker, L; Newman, A; Winkler, C A; Meltzer, D; Colly, L; Evermann, J F; Bush, M; Wildt, D E",Science,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2983425/,450
196898,Enhancing public health response to respiratory epidemics: are family physicians ready and willing to help?,2006,"Adenosine deaminase from calf intestine hydrolyzes adenine at a limiting rate four orders of magnitude lower than that for adenosine, while Km values for these substrates are about the same (Wolfenden, R., et al. (1969), Biochemistry 8, 2412-2415). Reactivity of 6-substituents, toward nucleophilic displacement, is found to be affected only slightly by removal of ribose as a 9-substituent, in model reactions. Substituent ribose thus appears to stabilize, selectively, the transition state for enzymatic deamination. In contrast with the small influence of substituent ribose on the apparent binding affinity of substrates, removal of substituent ribose from a potential transition state analogue, 1,6-dihydro-6-hydroxy-methylpurine ribonucleoside, results in a lowering of its affinity for the enzyme by several orders of magnitude. The synthesis of the analogue and related compounds is described, and their properties compared with those of other photoadducts and of the naturally occurring inhibitors covidarabine and coformycin. Binding of these inhibitors is found to result in the appearance of ultraviolet-absorbing bands in the neighborhood of 323 nm.","Wolfenden, R; Wentworth, D F; Mitchell, G N",Biochemistry,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/562185/,450

197993,Reflections on family practice and the pandemic first wave.,2020-06-01,"The initial clinical manifestations of COVID 19 in Wuhan was fever, cough and shortness of breath but early reports in Italy and Spain preceded emerging literature of skin involvement. COVID19 was first reported in December, 2019 and after several observations of cutaneous involvement in patients with the disease there was need to document such in literature. The details of the clinical presentation and the pathophysiological mechanisms of these cutaneous lesions are, however, still poorly understood. This is a review of twenty-four published scientific articles summarizing the various cutaneous features observed by the frontline health care givers involved in the management of patients with Covid-19. Maculopapular exanthem was the most common pattern reported, accounting for 44.4% of skin manifestations. The pseudo-chilblain, urticarial, vesicular, livedoid and Kawasaki-like disease patterns accounted for 18.1%, 17.6%, 12.9%, 5.1% and 1.9% respectively. Anumber of the patients (9.5%) developed skin lesions at the time of diagnosis of Covid-19 or at the onset of Covid-19 respiratory symptoms while 75.1% developed the lesions after the onset of Covid-19 respiratory symptoms or after laboratory diagnosis of the disease had been made. There is no gainsaying that apart from the respiratory and other reported systems, Covid-19 also affects the skin. Clinicians, especially dermatologists, should therefore watch out for the already reported skin lesions and for possible yet to be discovered or reported skin lesions in patients with Covid-19. Dermatologists must bear in mind that patients presenting at skin clinics may actually be infected with Covid-19.","Enitan, A O; Olasode, O A",West African journal of medicine,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33058134/,450
199601,Pandemic danger to the deep: The risk of marine mammals contracting SARS-CoV-2 from wastewater,2021,"Since early March 2003, the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus (CoV) infection has claimed 346 cases and 37 deaths in Taiwan. The epidemic occurred in two stages. The first stage caused limited familial or hospital infections and lasted from early March to mid-April. All cases had clear contact histories, primarily from Guangdong or Hong Kong. The second stage resulted in a large outbreak in a municipal hospital, and quickly spread to northern and southern Taiwan from late April to mid-June. During this stage, there were some sporadic cases with untraceable contact histories. To investigate the origin and transmission route of SARS-CoV in Taiwan's epidemic, we conducted a systematic viral lineage study by sequencing the entire viral genome from ten SARS patients. SARS-CoV viruses isolated from Taiwan were found closely related to those from Guangdong and Hong Kong. In addition, all cases from the second stage belonged to the same lineage after the municipal hospital outbreak, including the patients without an apparent contact history. Analyses of these full-length sequences showed a positive selection occurring during SARS-CoV virus evolution. The mismatch distribution indicated that SARS viral genomes did not reach equilibrium and suggested a recent introduction of the viruses into human populations. The estimated genome mutation rate was approximately 0.1 per genome, demonstrating possibly one of the lowest rates among known RNA viruses.","Yeh, Shiou-Hwei; Wang, Hurng-Yi; Tsai, Ching-Yi; Kao, Chuan-Liang; Yang, Jyh-Yuan; Liu, Hwan-Wun; Su, Ih-Jen; Tsai, Shih-Feng; Chen, Ding-Shinn; Chen, Pei-Jer",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14983045/,450
200448,Standing on Your Foot and Ankle During COVID-19: Perspectives From a Singaporean Orthopedic Foot and Ankle Surgery Unit,2020,"INTRODUCTION For many decades, Wertheim's radical hysterectomy via laparotomy, also known as Wertheim's radical abdominal hysterectomy (RAH), has been the traditional surgical approach for operable stage IB cervical cancer. However, many established cancer centres worldwide have recently shown total laparoscopic Wertheim's radical hysterectomy (TLRH) to be a safe and feasible alternative to the conventional abdominal route for early cervical cancer management. This technique was introduced in Singapore in 2009. METHODS This was a prospective pilot study comparing TLRH with RAH in a single large tertiary institution in Singapore. Inclusion criteria included surgically fit patients with early cervical cancer and no radiological evidence of regional or distant metastases. RESULTS From November 2009 to February 2011, a total of 18 TLRHs and 30 RAHs were performed. The median blood loss in the TLRH group was significantly lower than that in the RAH group (300 mL vs. 500 mL; p = 0.04). However, there was no statistically significant difference found between the two techniques in terms of operative time, hospital stay, bladder recovery, total lymph node yield or adjuvant treatment. No intraoperative bladder, ureteric or bowel complications were observed in the two groups. Postoperative complications occurred in 2 (11.1%) TLRH patients and 4 (13.3%) RAH patients. With a median follow-up of 37.3 (range 10-68) weeks, the rate of recurrence was found to be 5.6% for the TLRH group and 10.0% for the RAH group. CONCLUSION The results of our study suggest that with appropriate patient selection and increased experience, TLRH can be a safe and effective procedure for the management of early cervical cancer in Singapore.","Lim, Yong Kuei; Chia, Yin Nin; Yam, Kwai Lam",Singapore medical journal,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24356754/,450
200735,First detection of SARS-CoV-2 genetic material in the vicinity of COVID-19 isolation Centre in Bangladesh: Variation along the sewer network,2021,"SARS-CoV-2 has highlighted the requirement for a drastic change in pandemic response. While cases continue to rise, there is an urgent need to deploy sensitive and rapid testing in order to identify potential outbreaks before there is an opportunity for further community spread. Currently, reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) is considered the gold standard for diagnosing an active infection, using a nasopharyngeal swab; however, it can take days after symptoms develop to properly identify and trace the infection. While many civilian jobs can be performed remotely, the Department of Defense (DOD) is by nature a very fluid organization which requires in-person interaction and a physical presence to maintain effectiveness. In this commentary, we examine several current and emergent technologies and their ability to identify both active and previous SARS-CoV-2 infection, possibly in those without symptoms. Further, we will explore an ongoing study at the Air Force Research Laboratory, utilizing Reverse Transcription Loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP), next-generation sequencing, and the presence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies through Lateral Flow Immunoassays. The ability to identify SARS-CoV-2 through volatile organic compound biomarker identification will also be explored. By exploring and validating multiple testing strategies, and contributing to Operation Warp Speed, the DOD is postured to respond to SARS-CoV-2, and future pandemics.","Hicks, Daniel T; Metzger, David; Stamps, Blake W; Lee, Jae Hwan; Martin, Jennifer A; Salisbury, Richard L; Saldanha, Roland; Hart, Corey R; Grigsby, Claude C; Pangburn, Heather A",Medical journal,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33666911/,450

Upper and lower airway involvement is characteristic in patients with granulomatosis with polyangiitis and can sometimes represent the initial or in some instances the sole manifestation. The objective of this review is to summarize the various clinical manifestations of localized disease in GPA and their treatment. RECENT FINDINGS: Sinonasal disease is seen in up to 90% of patients. Otologic and ocular involvement is also commonly seen. Laryngeal and tracheal disease although less common is associated with significant morbidity and can be therapeutically challenging. Clinicians need to be aware of these localized GPA manifestations as they may be presenting disease features in the absence of other systemic findings. Treatment of localized GPA involves both immunosuppressive and surgical interventions for specific manifestations. Collaboration between specialists including rheumatologists, otolaryngologists, and ophthalmologists is often crucial to ensure optimal outcomes for patients. This is a narrative review that provides a comprehensive overview of localized granulomatosis with polyangiitis and current treatment options.","Sattui, Sebastian E; Lally, Lindsay",Curr Allergy Asthma Rep,,450

METHODS: We assessed the relation between previous treatment with ACE inhibitors, angiotensin-receptor blockers, beta-blockers, calcium-channel blockers, or thiazide diuretics and the likelihood of a positive or negative result on Covid-19 testing as well as the likelihood of severe illness (defined as intensive care, mechanical ventilation, or death) among patients who tested positive. Using Bayesian methods, we compared outcomes in patients who had been treated with these medications and in untreated patients, overall and in those with hypertension, after propensity-score matching for receipt of each medication class. A difference of at least 10 percentage points was prespecified as a substantial difference. RESULTS: Among 12,594 patients who were tested for Covid-19, a total of 5894 (46.8%) were positive; 1002 of these patients (17.0%) had severe illness. A history of hypertension was present in 4357 patients (34.6%), among whom 2573 (59.1%) had a positive test; 634 of these patients (24.6%) had severe illness. There was no association between any single medication class and an increased likelihood of a positive test. None of the medications examined was associated with a substantial increase in the risk of severe illness among patients who tested positive. CONCLUSIONS: We found no substantial increase in the likelihood of a positive test for Covid-19 or in the risk of severe Covid-19 among patients who tested positive in association with five common classes of antihypertensive medications.","Reynolds, Harmony R; Adhikari, Samrachana; Pulgarin, Claudia; Troxel, Andrea B; Iturrate, Eduardo; Johnson, Stephen B; Hausvater, Anaïs; Newman, Jonathan D; Berger, Jeffrey S; Bangalore, Sripal; Katz, Stuart D; Fishman, Glenn I; Kunichoff, Dennis; Chen, Yu; Ogedegbe, Gbenga; Hochman, Judith S",N Engl J Med,,450

However, our understanding of the clinical characteristics and treatment of critically ill pediatric patients and their ability of transmitting the coronavirus that causes COVID-19 still remains inadequate because only a handful pediatric cases of COVID-19 have been reported. METHODS: Epidemiology, clinical characteristics, treatment, laboratory data and follow-up information and the treatment of critically ill infant were recorded. RESULTS: The infant had life-threatening clinical features including high fever, septic shock, recurrent apnea, petechiae and acute kidney injury and persistent declined CD3+, CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. The duration of nasopharyngeal virus shedding lasted for 49 days even with the administration of lopinavir/ritonavir for 8 days. The CD3+, CD4+ and CD8+ T cells was partially recovered 68 days post onset of the disease. Accumulating of effector memory CD4+ T cells (CD4+TEM) was observed among T-cell compartment. The nucleic acid tests and serum antibody for the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 of the infant's mother who kept intimate contact with the infant were negative despite no strict personal protection. CONCLUSIONS: The persistent reduction of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells was the typical feature of critically ill infant with COVID-19. CD4+ and CD8+ T cells might play a key role in aggravating COVID-19 and predicts a more critical course in children. The prolonged nasopharyngeal virus shedding was related with the severity of respiratory injury.

METHODS: We prospectively collected data from all adult patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection diagnosed at the Hospital de la Santa Creu i Sant Pau, Barcelona, Spain. All the patients were diagnosed through nasopharyngeal swab PCR. The first surge spanned from 1st March to 13th August 2020, while surge two spanned from 14th August to 8th December 2020. RESULTS: There were 2479 and 852 patients with microbiologically proven SARS-CoV-2 infection in surges one and two, respectively. Patients from surge two were significantly younger (median age 52 (IQR 35) versus 59 (40) years, respectively, p < 0.001), had fewer comorbidities (379/852, 44.5% versus 1237/2479, 49.9%, p 0.007), and there was a shorter interval between onset of symptoms and diagnosis (median 3 (5) versus 4 (5) days, p < 0.001). All-cause in-hospital mortality significantly decreased for both the whole population (24/852, 2.8% versus 218/2479, 8.8%, p < 0.001) and hospitalized patients (20/302, 6.6% versus 206/1570, 13.1%, p 0.012). At adjusted logistic regression analysis, predictors of in-hospital mortality were older age (per year, adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 1.079, 95%CI 1.063-1.094), male sex (aOR 1.476, 95%CI 1.079-2.018), having comorbidities (aOR 1.414, 95%CI 0.934-2.141), ICU admission (aOR 3.812, 95%CI 1.875-7.751), mechanical ventilation (aOR 2.076, 95%CI 0.968-4.454), and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) during surge one (with respect to surge two) (aOR 2.176, 95%CI 1.286-3.680). CONCLUSIONS: First-wave SARS-CoV-2-infected patients had a more than two-fold higher in-hospital mortality than second-wave patients.

These systems are accurate and effective, but also costly, time-consuming, high-technological, infrastructure-dependent, and currently suffer from commercial reagent supply shortages. The reverse-transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) can be used as an alternative testing method. Here, we present a novel versatile (real-time and colorimetric) RT-LAMP for the simple (one-step), affordable (~1.7 /sample), and rapid detection of SARS-CoV-2 targeting both ORF1ab and N genes of the novel virus genome. We demonstrate the assay on RT-qPCR-positive clinical samples, obtaining most positive results under 25 min. In addition, a novel 30-min one-step drying protocol has been developed to stabilize the RT-LAMP reaction mixtures, allowing them to be stored at room temperature functionally for up to two months, as predicted by the Q10. This Dry-RT-LAMP methodology is suitable for potentially ready-to-use COVID-19 diagnosis. After further testing and validation, it could be easily applied both in developed and in low-income countries yielding rapid and reliable results.","García-Bernalt Diego, Juan; Fernández-Soto, Pedro; Domínguez-Gil, Marta; Belhassen-García, Moncef; Bellido, Juan Luis Muñoz; Muro, Antonio",Diagnostics (Basel),,450
243397,The Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Cleft Care,2021,"BACKGROUND: Changes in autonomic nervous system function, characterized by heart rate variability (HRV), have been associated with infection and observed prior to its clinical identification. OBJECTIVE: We performed an evaluation of HRV collected by a wearable device to identify and predict COVID-19 and its related symptoms. METHODS: Health care workers in the Mount Sinai Health System were prospectively followed in an ongoing observational study using the custom Warrior Watch Study app, which was downloaded to their smartphones. Participants wore an Apple Watch for the duration of the study, measuring HRV throughout the follow-up period. Surveys assessing infection and symptom-related questions were obtained daily. RESULTS: Using a mixed-effect cosinor model, the mean amplitude of the circadian pattern of the standard deviation of the interbeat interval of normal sinus beats (SDNN), an HRV metric, differed between subjects with and without COVID-19 (P=.006). The mean amplitude of this circadian pattern differed between individuals during the 7 days before and the 7 days after a COVID-19 diagnosis compared to this metric during uninfected time periods (P=.01). Significant changes in the mean and amplitude of the circadian pattern of the SDNN was observed between the first day of reporting a COVID-19-related symptom compared to all other symptom-free days (P=.01). CONCLUSIONS: Longitudinally collected HRV metrics from a commonly worn commercial wearable device (Apple Watch) can predict the diagnosis of COVID-19 and identify COVID-19-related symptoms. Prior to the diagnosis of COVID-19 by nasal swab polymerase chain reaction testing, significant changes in HRV were observed, demonstrating the predictive ability of this metric to identify COVID-19 infection.","Hirten, Robert P; Danieletto, Matteo; Tomalin, Lewis; Choi, Katie Hyewon; Zweig, Micol; Golden, Eddye; Kaur, Sparshdeep; Helmus, Drew; Biello, Anthony; Pyzik, Renata; Charney, Alexander; Miotto, Riccardo; Glicksberg, Benjamin S; Levin, Matthew; Nabeel, Ismail; Aberg, Judith; Reich, David; Charney, Dennis; Bottinger, Erwin P; Keefer, Laurie; Suarez-Farinas, Mayte; Nadkarni, Girish N; Fayad, Zahi A",J Med Internet Res,,450

In the pathogenesis of this virus proinflammatory cytokine storm has been called to have the main role. The right timing should be made for treatments. We proposed IL- 1 blocking by anakinra in seventeen Covid-19 patients at high risk of worsening. METHODS: Patients were assessed according to HScore, SOFA [Sequential Organ Failure Assessment Score= SOFA], MuLBSTA Score (Multilobular infiltration, Hypo-Lymphocytosis, Bacterial coinfection, Smoking history, hyper-Tension, and Age), Brescia-COVID respiratory severity scale (BCRSS). RESULTS: In our study, mortality rate was 17.6%. Consequently, 1 (5.9%) patient was receiving low-flow oxygen supply, 3 (17.6%) patients needed no longer oxygen supply and 10 (58.8%) patients were discharged from hospital. CONCLUSION: According to results of our study in the manner of general evaluation; we found that SOFA, MuLBSTA and BCRSS scores were one step ahead according to HScore being insufficient to determine early phases of the disease. In our opinion, the prominent factors those emphasize the use of Anakinra could be listed as comorbidity, risk or presence of secondary infection, ongoing malignant disease.

To further understand the disease pathogenesis and, consequently, to develop an additional tool for clinicians to evaluate patients for presumptive intervention we sought to compare plasma cytokine levels between a range of donor and patient samples grouped by a COVID-19 Severity Score (CSS) based on need for hospitalization and oxygen requirement. Here we utilize a mutual information algorithm that classifies the information gain for CSS prediction provided by cytokine expression levels and clinical variables. Using this methodology, we found that a small number of clinical and cytokine expression variables are predictive of presenting COVID-19 disease severity, raising questions about the mechanism by which COVID-19 creates severe illness. The variables that were the most predictive of CSS included clinical variables such as age and abnormal chest x-ray as well as cytokines such as macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF), interferon-inducible protein 10 (IP-10) and Interleukin-1 Receptor Antagonist (IL-1RA). Our results suggest that SARS-CoV-2 infection causes a plethora of changes in cytokine profiles and that particularly in severely ill patients, these changes are consistent with the presence of Macrophage Activation Syndrome and could furthermore be used as a biomarker to predict disease severity.","Huntington, Kelsey E; Louie, Anna D; Lee, Chun Geun; Elias, Jack A; Ross, Eric A; El-Deiry, Wafik S",,,450

272760,Coming home - Boreal ecosystem claims Atlantic sector of the Arctic,2021,"PURPOSE: A telehealth oncology practice was created to care for patients in rural communities to improve access to health care, decrease financial burdens, and save time. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with cancer at Sevier Valley Hospital in Richfield, Utah, were treated with a real-time video-based telehealth program under the care of an oncologist at a tertiary medical center. Data on financial savings, travel hours, mileage avoided, carbon emissions reduced, and revenue retained by Sevier Valley Hospital were collected from 2015 to 2018. RESULTS: From 2015 to 2018, 119 patients with cancer in Richfield, Utah, were treated with telehealth for oncology visits, accounting for 1,025 patient encounters. On average, patients saved 4 hours and 40 minutes and 332 miles roundtrip per encounter. In total, patients' savings were estimated to be $333,074. Carbon emissions were reduced by approximately 150,000 kg. Of new patient referrals, 59% were for solid tumors (70 of 119 referrals; 42 metastatic and 28 nonmetastatic cancers), and 41% were hematology consultations (49 of 119 referrals; 28 classical and 21 malignant hematologic conditions). We estimate that Sevier Valley Hospital retained $3,605,500 in revenue over this 4-year period. CONCLUSION: Using a telehealth program in rural Utah, patients with cancer benefited from substantial time and monetary savings. The local medical center was able to retain revenue it would have otherwise lost to outsourcing cancer care. Recent regulatory changes to address the COVID-19 pandemic should increase the number of patients with cancer treated via telehealth nationwide.","Thota, Ramya; Gill, David M; Brant, Jamie L; Yeatman, Timothy J; Haslem, Derrick S",JCO Oncol Pract,,450
279313,Examens du CMFC et COVID-19: S’adapter à une situation exceptionnelle,2020,"Holographic molecular binding assays use holographic video microscopy to directly detect molecules binding to the surfaces of micrometer-scale colloidal beads by monitoring associated changes in the beads' light-scattering properties. Holograms of individual spheres are analyzed by fitting to a generative model based on the Lorenz-Mie theory of light scattering. Each fit yields an estimate of a probe bead's diameter and refractive index with sufficient precision to watch the beads grow as molecules bind. Rather than modeling the molecular-scale coating, however, these fits use effective medium theory, treating the coated sphere as if it were homogeneous. This effective-sphere analysis is rapid and numerically robust and so is useful for practical implementations of label-free immunoassays. Here, we assess how effective-sphere properties reflect the properties of molecular-scale coatings by modeling coated spheres with the discrete-dipole approximation and analyzing their holograms with the effective-sphere model.","Altman, Lauren E.; Grier, David G.",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.13134v1.pdf,450

OOP expenditure (OOPE) has a negative impact on equity and can increase the risk of vulnerable groups slipping into poverty. Objectives: The study aimed to estimate the OOPE on health and catastrophic health expenditure (CHE) and their sociodemographic determinants in a rural area of Purba Barddhaman. Methods: A community-based cross-sectional study was conducted between July 2018 and February 2019 in Bhatar Block of Purba Bardhaman district, West Bengal. Required sample of 235 households, selected randomly were primary study units. One respondent from each household was interviewed with a predesigned, pretested schedule for sociodemographic and health-care expenditure-related variables. Mann-Whitney U test/Kruskal Wallis H test and multivariable logistic regression was applied. Results: The median OOP health expenditure was Rs. 3870 (inter quartile range: 2156-4952). Of 235 families, 38 (16.2%) had CHE over a period of 1 year. The significant correlates for CHE were type of village according to the presence of public health-care facility (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 4.748; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.886-11.956), presence of health insurance (AOR = 11.124; 95% CI: 3.690-33.535) and gender of the head of the family (AOR = 18.176; 95% CI: 3.353-98.534). Concentration curve suggested a higher concentration of CHE among poor households. Conclusion: CHE is substantially high in the area. The efforts are required to make the services available as close to the households as possible and to increase awareness about health facilities.","Dalui, Anirban; Banerjee, Sitikantha; Roy, Ramaprasad",Indian J Public Health,,450

The relevant study claims that due to the imposition of lockdown during COVID-19 pandemic, the atmospheric pollution level has been significantly reduced over the metropolitan city Kolkata like other cities of the world. The main objective of this study is to predict the concentration of PM2.5 using multiple linear regression (MLR) and artificial neural network (ANN) models and similarly, to compare the accuracy level of two models. The concentration of PM2.5 data has been obtained from state pollution control board, Govt. of West Bengal and daily meteorological data have been collected from the world weather website. The results show that non-linear artificial neural network model is more rational compared with multiple linear regression model due to its high precision and accuracy level (in respect to RMSE, MAE and R2). In this research artificial neural network (ANN) model exhibited higher accuracy during the training and testing phases (root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE) and R2 indicate 3.74, 1.14 and 0.91 respectively in training phase and 2.55, 4.32 and 0.69 in testing phase respectively).

298988,The Coronavirus (COVID-19) Effect on Public Sentiments Regarding Elective Plastic Surgery in the United States,2021,"BACKGROUND: Thrombocytopenia and thrombosis are prominent in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), particularly among critically ill patients; however, the mechanism is unclear. Such critically ill COVID-19 patients may be suspected of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT), given similar clinical features. OBJECTIVES: We investigated the presence of platelet-activating anti-platelet-factor 4 (PF4)/heparin antibodies in critically ill COVID-19 patients suspected of HIT. PATIENTS/METHODS: We tested 10 critically ill COVID-19 patients suspected of HIT for anti-PF4/heparin antibodies and functional platelet activation in the serotonin release assay (SRA). Anti-human CD32 antibody (IV.3) was added to the SRA to confirm FcÎ³RIIA involvement. Additionally, SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were measured using an in-house ELISA. Finally, von Willebrand factor (VWF) antigen and activity were measured along with A Disintegrin And Metalloprotease with ThromboSpondin-13 Domain (ADAMTS13) activity and the presence of anti-ADAMTS13 antibodies. RESULTS: Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia was excluded in all samples based on anti-PF4/heparin antibody and SRA results. Notably, six COVID-19 patients demonstrated platelet activation by the SRA that was inhibited by FcÎ³RIIA receptor blockade, confirming an immune complex (IC)-mediated reaction. Platelet activation was independent of heparin but inhibited by both therapeutic and high dose heparin. All six samples were positive for antibodies targeting the receptor binding domain (RBD) or the spike protein of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. These samples also featured significantly increased VWF antigen and activity, which was not statistically different from the four COVID-19 samples without platelet activation. ADAMTS13 activity was not severely reduced, and ADAMTS13 inhibitors were not present, thus ruling out a primary thrombotic microangiopathy. CONCLUSIONS: Our study identifies platelet-activating ICs as a novel mechanism that contributes to critically ill COVID-19.","Nazy, Ishac; Jevtic, Stefan D; Moore, Jane C; Huynh, Angela; Smith, James W; Kelton, John G; Arnold, Donald M",J Thromb Haemost,,450

Histopathology of invasive Aspergillus tracheobronchitis in patients with severe COVID-19 confirms tracheal ulcers with tissue invasion of Aspergillus hyphae but without angioinvasion, which differs from patients with severe influenza, where early angioinvasion is observed. We argue that aggregation of predisposing factors (eg, factors that are defined by the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer and Mycoses Study Group Education and Research Consortium or genetic polymorphisms), viral factors (eg, tropism and lytic effects), immune defence factors, and effects of concomitant therapies will determine whether and when the angioinvasion threshold is reached. Management of invasive Aspergillus tracheobronchitis should include reducing viral lytic effects, rebalancing immune dysregulation, and systemic and local antifungal therapy. Future study designs should involve approaches that aim to develop improved diagnostics for tissue invasion and airways involvement and identify the immune status of the patient to guide personalised immunotherapy.","van de Veerdonk, Frank L; Brüggemann, Roger J M; Vos, Shoko; De Hertogh, Gert; Wauters, Joost; Reijers, Monique H E; Netea, Mihai G; Schouten, Jeroen A; Verweij, Paul E",Lancet Respir Med,,450

They are luminescent molecules with high quantum yields and can be designed to enter a cell and act as antimicrobial and antiviral compounds, as biocompatible fluorescent probes directed towards target organelles in living cells, as labelling agents, as selective sensors for the detection of fibrillar and prefibrillar amyloid in the proteic field and in a fluorescence turn-on system for the detection of saccharides, as photosensitizers in photodynamic therapy (due to their capacity to highly induce toxicity after light activation), and as drug delivery systems. The antibacterial properties of OPEs have been the most studied against very popular and resistant pathogens, and in this paper the achievements of these studies are reviewed, together with almost all the other roles held by such oligomers. In the recent decade, their antifungal and antiviral effects have attracted the attention of researchers who believe OPEs to be possible biocides of the future.

334152,Getting Better Results in Flexor Tendon Surgery and Therapy,2021,"BACKGROUND: In early childhood allergy prevention (ECAP), parents act on behalf of their children. Parental health literacy and the availability of high-quality information, both online and offline, are crucial for effective ECAP. Recent research highlights three main points. First, parents need sufficient health literacy to discriminate between high-quality and low-quality information. Second, ECAP information behaviors may vary between phases of childhood development and according to individual circumstances. Third, to strengthen user-centeredness of available services, a better overview of parents' information practices and needs and how they handle uncertainties is required. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to explore why, how, and when parents search for and apply ECAP-specific health information and which individual (eg, understanding of advice) and organizational challenges (eg, information services, information complexity, and changing recommendations) they perceive and how they handle them. This study also aims to assess the needs and preferences that parents express for future information formats and contents. The findings should inform the practical design of ECAP information as well as formats and channels specific to different parent groups. METHODS: The above-named issues will be explored with parents in four German cities as one element in our efforts to cover the spectrum of perspectives. Based on a mixed methods design, including qualitative and quantitative assessments, the first year serves to prepare focus groups, a piloted focus group guide, a short standardized survey adapted from the European Health Literacy Project, recruitment channels, and the recruitment of participants. After conducting 20 focus groups in the second year, data will be analyzed via a constant comparison method in the third year. Based on this, practice implications on channels (ie, Where?), formats (ie, How?), and contents (ie, What?) of ECAP-specific information will be derived and discussed with parents and associated project partners before its dissemination to relevant ECAP actors (eg, childcare institutions and pediatricians). RESULTS: The study began with preselection of recruitment channels, drafting of recruitment and study information for potential participants, and agreement on a first full version of the guideline. Then, a detailed contact list was compiled of health professionals, administrative and social institutions, and relevant social media channels (N=386) to be approached for assistance in contacting parents. The recruitment was postponed due to COVID-19 and will start in January 2021. CONCLUSIONS: ECAP is a relevant example for assessing how users (ie, parents) handle not only health information but the various and continuous changes, uncertainties, and controversies attached to it. So far, it is unclear how parents implement the respective scientific recommendations and expert advice, which is why this study aims to inform those who communicate with parents about ECAP information.

STUDY DESIGN: Observational study. PLACE AND DURATION OF STUDY: Fauji Foundation Hospital, Rawalpindi from April to July 2020. Methodology: All 58 patients (n=58) presenting with acute appendicitis (AA) were included. Assessment was done with Alvarado score (AS) and ultrasound. Treatment was initiated according to the algorithm corresponding with AS. Those with AS score of 4 or less were started on outpatient oral antibiotics. Patients with AS score of 5 or more were admitted for IV antibiotics. If the symptoms and signs resolved, they were sent home on oral antibiotics to complete a course of 5 days. If their condition did not improve in 72 hours or deteriorated at any time, appendectomy was done. Outcomes were recorded and analysed on SPSS. RESULTS: Out of 58 patients, 16 were treated with oral, while 42 with IV antibiotics. This yielded a statistically significant difference on the course of disease (p=0.028). Resolution of symptoms was seen in 27.6% (n=16) with conservative management; whereas, 72.4% (n=42) patients needed a subsequent appendectomy. The difference in operative findings between patients, who had been given oral or IV antibiotics was statistically insignificant (p=0.536). Diagnostic value of leukocyte count (TLC), ultrasound and AS was not found to be significant. CONCLUSION: Non-operative management is successful in about a quarter of the patients of AA.

It was found that the B.1.1.7 (also 501Y.V1) variant, first detected in the United Kingdom, could be serendipitously detected by the Thermo Fisher TaqPath COVID-19 PCR assay because a key deletion in these viruses, spike &#916;69-70, would cause a ""spike gene target failure"" (SGTF) result.

Consequently, nurses from acute care areas were called in to staff the ICU along with experienced intensive care nurses. AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To describe Swedish registered nurses' experiences of caring for patients with COVID-19 in ICUs during the pandemic. DESIGN: Mixed method survey design. METHODS: An online questionnaire was distributed through social media to registered nurses who had been working in the ICU during the COVID-19 outbreak. Data were collected for 1 week (May 2020) and analysed using content analysis and descriptive statistics. RESULTS: Of the 282 nurses who participated, the majority were ICU nurses (n = 151; 54%). Half of the nurses specialized in ICU reported that they were responsible for the ICU care of three or more patients during the pandemic (n = 75; 50%). Among non-intensive care nurses, only 19% received introduction to the COVID-19 ICU (n = 26). The analysis of data regarding nurses' experiences resulted in three categories: tumbling into chaos, diminished nursing care, and transition into pandemic ICU care. Participants described how patient safety and care quality were compromised, and that nursing care was severely deprioritized during the pandemic. The situation of not being able to provide nursing care resulted in ethical stress. Furthermore, an increased workload and worsened work environment affected nurses' health and well-being. CONCLUSIONS: The findings from the present study indicate that nurses perceived that patient safety and quality of care were compromised during the pandemic. This resulted in ethical stress among nurses, which may have affected their physical and psychosocial well-being. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: The COVID-19 pandemic had a severe impact on nurses' work environment, which could result in burnout and staff turnover.","Bergman, Lina; Falk, Ann-Charlotte; Wolf, Axel; Larsson, Ing-Marie",Nurs. crit. care,,450

Severe/critical illness was less common in the SARS-CoV-2/HBV co-infected patient group and no deaths were observed. CONCLUSIONS: SARS-CoV-2/HBV coinfection did not change the severity and outcome of COVID-19. However, the patients with SARS-CoV-2/HBV co-infection should be closely monitored for liver complications.","Bekçibasi, Muhammed; Arslan, Eyüp",Int J Clin Pract,,450
414210,從美國法的觀點看「不可抗力」事件,2020,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was first diagnosed in Scotland on 1 March 2020. During the first month of the outbreak, 2,641 cases of COVID-19 led to 1,832 hospital admissions, 207 intensive care admissions and 126 deaths. We aimed to identify the source and number of introductions of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) into Scotland using a combined phylogenetic and epidemiological approach. Sequencing of 1,314 SARS-CoV-2 viral genomes from available patient samples enabled us to estimate that SARS-CoV-2 was introduced to Scotland on at least 283 occasions during February and March 2020. Epidemiological analysis confirmed that early introductions of SARS-CoV-2 originated from mainland Europe (the majority from Italy and Spain). We identified subsequent early outbreaks in the community, within healthcare facilities and at an international conference. Community transmission occurred after 2 March, 3 weeks before control measures were introduced. Earlier travel restrictions or quarantine measures, both locally and internationally, would have reduced the number of COVID-19 cases in Scotland. The risk of multiple reintroduction events in future waves of infection remains high in the absence of population immunity.","da Silva Filipe, Ana; Shepherd, James G; Williams, Thomas; Hughes, Joseph; Aranday-Cortes, Elihu; Asamaphan, Patawee; Ashraf, Shirin; Balcazar, Carlos; Brunker, Kirstyn; Campbell, Alasdair; Carmichael, Stephen; Davis, Chris; Dewar, Rebecca; Gallagher, Michael D; Gunson, Rory; Hill, Verity; Ho, Antonia; Jackson, Ben; James, Edward; Jesudason, Natasha; Johnson, Natasha; McWilliam Leitch, E Carol; Li, Kathy; MacLean, Alasdair; Mair, Daniel; McAllister, David A; McCrone, John T; McDonald, Sarah E; McHugh, Martin P; Morris, A Keith; Nichols, Jenna; Niebel, Marc; Nomikou, Kyriaki; Orton, Richard J; O039,; Toole, Áine; Palmarini, Massimo; Parcell, Benjamin J; Parr, Yasmin A; Rambaut, Andrew; Rooke, Stefan; Shaaban, Sharif; Shah, Rajiv; Singer, Joshua B; Smollett, Katherine; Starinskij, Igor; Tong, Lily; Sreenu, Vattipally B; Wastnedge, Elizabeth; Holden, Matthew T G; Robertson, David L",Nat Microbiol,,450
414895,Notizen aus der Chemie,2020,"AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To document the level of frailty in sub-acute COVID-19 patients recovering from acute respiratory failure and investigate the associations between frailty, assessed by the nurse using the Blaylock Risk Assessment Screening Score (BRASS), and clinical and functional patient characteristics during hospitalisation. BACKGROUND: Frailty is a major problem in patients discharged from acute care, but no data are available on the frailty risk in survivors of COVID-19 infection. DESIGN: A descriptive cross-sectional study (STROBE checklist). METHODS: At admission to sub-acute care in 2020, 236 COVID-19 patients (median age 77 years - interquartile range 68-83) were administered BRASS and classified into 3 levels of frailty risk. The Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB) was also administered to measure physical function and disability. Differences between BRASS levels and associations between BRASS index and clinical parameters were analysed. RESULTS: The median BRASS index was 14.0 (interquartile range 9.0-20.0) denoting intermediate frailty (32.2%, 41.1%, 26.7% of patients exhibited low, intermediate and high frailty, respectively). Significant differences emerged between the BRASS frailty classes regards to sex, comorbidities, history of cognitive deficits, previous mechanical ventilation support and SPPB score. Patients with no comorbidities (14%) exhibited low frailty (BRASS: median 5.5, interquartile range 3.0-12.0). Age &#8805;65 years, presence of comorbidities, cognitive deficit and SPPB % predicted <50% were significant predictors of high frailty. CONCLUSIONS: Most COVID-19 survivors exhibit substantial frailty and require continuing care after discharge from acute care. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: The BRASS index is a valuable tool for nurses to identify those patients most at risk of frailty, who require a programme of rehabilitation and community reintegration.","Mandora, Elena; Comini, Laura; Olivares, Adriana; Fracassi, Michela; Cadei, Maria Grazia; Paneroni, Mara; Marchina, Lucia; Suruniuc, Adrian; Luisa, Alberto; Scalvini, Simonetta; Corica, Giacomo; Vitacca, Michele",J. clin. nurs,,450

Artificial intelligence-based diagnostic decision support system have been developed to enhance clinical performance by suggesting differential diagnoses to a given case, based on an integrated medical knowledge base and machine learning techniques. The purpose of the study is to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of Ada, an app-based diagnostic tool and the impact on patient outcome. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The eRadaR trial is a prospective, double-blinded study with patients presenting to the emergency room (ER) with abdominal pain. At initial contact in the ER, a structured interview will be performed using the Ada-App and both, patients and attending physicians, will be blinded to the proposed diagnosis lists until trial completion. Throughout the study, clinical data relating to diagnostic findings and types of therapy will be obtained and the follow-up until day 90 will comprise occurrence of complications and overall survival of patients. The primary efficacy of the trial is defined by the percentage of correct diagnoses suggested by Ada compared with the final discharge diagnosis. Further, accuracy and timing of diagnosis will be compared with decision making of classical doctor-patient interaction. Secondary objectives are complications, length of hospital stay and overall survival. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethical approval was received by the independent ethics committee (IEC) of the Goethe-University Frankfurt on 9 April 2020 including the patient information material and informed consent form. All protocol amendments must be reported to and adapted by the IEC. The results from this study will be submitted to peer-reviewed journals and reported at suitable national and international meetings.

In that paper, SARS in 2003 was the representative instance and it was suggested that MERS may be another. In April 2014, MERS incident cases showed a spectacular spike (going from a handful in the previous April to more than 260 in that month of 2014) reminiscent of a figure I published nine months earlier. Here I refit the two-level and several variant SS models to incident data from January 1, 2013--April 30, 2014 and conclude that MERS will go pandemic (all other factors remaining the same). In addition, I discuss a number of model-realism and fitting methodology issues relevant to analysing SS epidemics.","Wick, W. David",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1405.4431v1.pdf,450

438006,145th Annual Meeting American Neurological Association,2020,"In IgA nephropathy (IgAN), IgA immune complexes are deposited in the mesangium and drive inflammation and extracellular matrix (ECM) remodelling. The functional links between IgA deposition, inflammation, and matrix remodelling are not well characterized. We recently performed urine liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry proteomics and identified multiple ECM glycoproteins whose expression and function in IgAN is unclear. None of the urine glycoproteins was regulated in IgAN transcriptomics, indicating that tissue remodelling rather than increased expression might contribute to their presence in urine. To investigate this, we examined the IgAN expression profile of metalloproteinases, enzymes involved in the remodelling of ECM proteins, and noted that the proteoglycanase ADAMTS5 was upregulated in IgAN kidneys. ADAMTS5 accumulated in areas of inflammation, and ADAMTS5+ cells were seen in the tubulointerstitium and glomeruli. The enzyme was expressed by CD64+ cells and its expression was increased by IL-1 and LPS. Analysis of myeloid cell transcriptomics revealed that ADAMTS5 is enriched in human classical monocytes. ADAMTS5+ cells were present in areas of matrix remodelling and associated with ECM proteins lumican, versican, and collagen-4. Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry proteomics of kidney explants digested with ADAMTS5, identified multiple kidney proteins affected by ADAMTS5 and revealed specific proteolysis of complement C3 and fibronectin associated with IgA on immune complexes. ADAMTS5 processing of immune complex proteins reduced binding to cultured mesangial cells. ADAMTS5 is associated with interstitial inflammatory cells in IgAN and other kidney lesions and fragments relevant extracellular proteins. The proteolytic enzyme might be a new translational target relevant to inflammation and scarring in kidney disease.","Taylor, Scott; Whitfield, Molly; Barratt, Jonathan; Didangelos, Athanasios",J. immunol,,450

442818,Plastic and reconstructive surgery procedures during the COVID-19 pandemic: A paradigm shift,2021,"AimsTo assess the clinical presentation and outcomes of COVID-19 positive patients with dementia and to evaluate the suitability of the “4C mortality score.” Older adults with dementia are a vulnerable patient group therefore it was predicted that this patient demographic would have poorer outcomes and high mortality rates. Ward 24 is an organic old age psychiatry ward in University Hospital Monklands, Lanarkshire for patients with advanced dementia. Older adults have been found to have atypical presentations and non-specific symptoms in COVID-19, however given COVID is still a new and evolving disease, little is known about the impact on dementia patients. The 4C mortality score was designed to predict in-hospital mortality for hospitalised COVID-19 patients using a number of clinical parameters.MethodData were collected retrospectively from all inpatients on ward 24 testing positive for COVID-19 between October and December 2020. Data were collected using online MIDIS entries, paper notes, NEWS charts and Clinical Portal. A 4C mortality score was calculated for each patient using an online calculator based on the data collected.Result15 patients tested positive for COVID-19;47% male and 53% female, age range between 64 and 92 years old. 67% of patients had 3 or more comorbidities and 89% had either a high or very high 4C mortality score. Mortality from COVID-19 was 13% and 20% of patients required oxygen. 27% of patients were asymptomatic, these patients also had the lower risk mortality scores. 67% presented with pyrexia, 33% had a cough and 13% had breathlessness. Non-specific symptoms were also seen;53% had fatigue, 20% had diarrhoea and 20% had unresponsive episodes. Post COVID delirium was seen in 20% of patients.ConclusionMortality rates were lower than expected, indicating that the 4C mortality score might not be appropriate to use in this patient demographic due to confounding factors. Atypical symptoms were common in patients, with a variability of clinical presentations within the patient demographic. These findings suggest the importance of having a low threshold for COVID-19 infection even in the absence of typical symptoms. Development of an alternative risk stratification tool would be beneficial for this patient group, with further studies needed on a larger scale to facilitate this.","Giles, Emily",BJPsych Open,,450

This study was designed to describe residents' knowledge, attitudes, and practice behaviors (KAP) during the outbreak of COVID-19. Methods: An anonymous online questionnaire was randomly administrated to residents in mainland China between Mar 7 and Mar 16, 2020. Residents' responses to KAP were quantified by descriptive and stratified analyses. A Multiple Logistic Regression model was employed to identify risk factors associated with KAP scores. Results: A total of 10,195 participants were enrolled from 32 provinces of China. Participants of the &#8805;61 years group had higher KAP scores [adjusted Odds Ratio (ORadj) = 4.8, 95% Confidence Interval (CI): 3.0-7.7, P < 0.0001], and the married participants and those in low-income families had higher scores of KAP (ORadj = 1.2, 95% CI: 1.1-1.3; ORadj = 1.8, 95% CI: 1.6-2.2, respectively, both P < 0.0001).

METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed endoscopies performed in 15 Dutch hospitals by comparing periods 15 March to 25 June of 2019 and 2020 using the prospective Trans.IT database. RESULTS: During lockdown in 2020, 9776 patients underwent endoscopy compared with 19â296 in 2019. Gastroscopies decreased by 57â% (from 7846 to 4467) and colonoscopies by 45â% (from 12219 to 5609), whereas endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography volumes remained comparable (from 578 to 522).

Epidemiological and clinical studies suggest that the phenomenology of depression may differ during childhood and adolescence. However, participants in these studies may not reflect depressed young people referred to routine clinical services. The aim of this paper was to describe referrals for depression to a UK routine public healthcare service for children and adolescents with mental health difficulties. METHOD: This paper describes a consecutive series of adolescents (N = 100, aged 12-17 years), referred for depression to a routine public healthcare child and adolescent mental health service, in the south of England. Young people and their caregivers completed a structured diagnostic interview and self-report measures of anxiety and depression. RESULTS: Fewer than half of young people referred for depression met diagnostic criteria for a depressive disorder. The key symptoms reported by those with depression were low mood or irritability, cognitive disturbances, sleep disturbances and negative self-perceptions. Suicidal ideation was common and was considerably higher than reported in other studies. Caregiver and young person's accounts of adolescent symptoms of depression and anxiety were uncorrelated. Caregivers also reported fewer symptoms of depression in their child than adolescents themselves. CONCLUSIONS: These data have direct relevance to the design and delivery of public mental health services for children and adolescents. However, we do not know how representative this sample is of other clinical populations in the UK or in other countries. There is a need to collect routine data from other services to assess the needs of this group of high-risk adolescents.","Orchard, Faith; Pass, Laura; Marshall, Tamsin; Reynolds, Shirley",Child Adolesc Ment Health,,450

Interindividual heterogeneity evokes variable functional outcome complicating targeted therapy. We aimed to characterize infarct chemokine CXC-motif receptor 4 (CXCR4) expression using positron emission tomography (PET) and establish its relationship to cardiac outcome. We tested whether image-guided early CXCR4 directed therapy attenuates chronic dysfunction. METHODS AND RESULTS : Mice (n = 180) underwent coronary ligation or sham surgery and serial PET imaging over 7 days. Infarct CXCR4 content was elevated over 3 days after MI compared with sham (%ID/g, Day 1:1.1 ± 0.2; Day 3:0.9 ± 0.2 vs. 0.6 ± 0.1, P < 0.001), confirmed by flow cytometry and histopathology. Mice that died of left ventricle (LV) rupture exhibited persistent inflammation at 3 days compared with survivors (1.2 ± 0.3 vs. 0.9 ± 0.2% ID/g, P < 0.001). Cardiac magnetic resonance measured cardiac function. Higher CXCR4 signal at 1 and 3 days independently predicted worse functional outcome at 6 weeks (rpartial = -0.4, P = 0.04). Mice were treated with CXCR4 blocker AMD3100 following the imaging timecourse. On-peak CXCR4 blockade at 3 days lowered LV rupture incidence vs. untreated MI (8% vs. 25%), and improved contractile function at 6 weeks (+24%, P = 0.01). Off-peak CXCR4 blockade at 7 days did not improve outcome. Flow cytometry analysis revealed lower LV neutrophil and Ly6Chigh monocyte content after on-peak treatment. Patients (n = 50) early after MI underwent CXCR4 PET imaging and functional assessment. Infarct CXCR4 expression in acute MI patients correlated with contractile function at time of PET and on follow-up. CONCLUSION : Positron emission tomography imaging identifies early CXCR4 up-regulation which predicts acute rupture and chronic contractile dysfunction. Imaging-guided CXCR4 inhibition accelerates inflammatory resolution and improves outcome. This supports a molecular imaging-based theranostic approach to guide therapy after MI.","Hess, Annika; Derlin, Thorsten; Koenig, Tobias; Diekmann, Johanna; Wittneben, Alexander; Wang, Yong; Wester, Hans-Juergen; Ross, Tobias L; Wollert, Kai C; Bauersachs, Johann; Bengel, Frank M; Thackeray, James T",Eur. heart j,,450

Drawing on historical and epidemiological analyses, we critique contemporary approaches to reducing vaccine hesitancy and articulate our notion of vaccine confidence as an expanded way of conceptualizing the problem and how to respond to it. Intervening on the rush of vaccine optimism we see pervading present discourse around the COVID-19 epidemic, we call for a re-imagination of the culture of public health and the meaning of vaccine safety regulations. Public confidence in vaccination programs depends on the work they do for the community-social, political, and moral as well as biological. The concept of public health and its programs must be broader than the delivery of the vaccine technology itself. The narrative work and policy actions entailed in actualizing such changes will, we expect, be essential in achieving a true vaccine confidence, however the public reacts to the specific vaccine that may be developed for COVID-19.","Harrison, Emily A; Wu, Julia W",Eur J Epidemiol,,450

482180,Evaluation of two rapid ultrafiltration-based methods for SARS-CoV-2 concentration from wastewater,2021,"OBJECTIVES/HYPOTHESIS: The COVID-19 pandemic has led to unprecedented global changes in the delivery of healthcare over a short period of time. With the implementation of shelter-in-place orders, otolaryngology clinic visits at our institution were transitioned to telemedicine. This change enabled the rapid characterization of the patients who accepted and declined telemedicine. STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional analysis. METHODS: A review was conducted of 525 otolaryngology patients at a tertiary-care referral center with scheduled visits requiring rescheduling to a future date or a telemedicine visit. Visit, demographic information, and reason for deferring telemedicine were collected for analysis. RESULTS: Seventy-two percent of patients declined a telemedicine visit, with the most common reason being the lack of a physical exam (97%). There was an even distribution of demographics between those who accepted and declined visits. There was an association between declining telemedicine with older age (P = .0004) and otology visits (P = .0003), whereas facial plastics patients were more likely to accept (P < .0001). Patients scheduled earlier during the pandemic were more likely to accept a visit with a median of 28 days from onset of shelter-in-place orders versus 35 for those who declined (P < .0001). CONCLUSIONS: We describe our initial experience with a transition to telemedicine, where the majority of patients would decline a virtual visit due to the lack of a physical exam. Although the future remains uncertain, telemedicine will continue to play a vital role in healthcare delivery. We believe that understanding our patient base gives critical insights that will help guide and improve virtual care to meet patients' needs.

As the pandemic continues, we will be challenged to improve or maintain the health status of those with HF by optimizing guideline-directed care despite physical distancing constraints and a reduction in the health care workforce. This will require development of new strategies specifically targeted at decreasing the risk of decompensation and resultant HF hospitalization. As such, we must quickly pivot to the adoption and application of novel technologies and revise usual care models, processes, and workflow. The unprecedented COVID-19 crisis has delivered the Canadian HF community a burning platform for the design and implementation of innovative approaches to support the vulnerable population we serve; born out of necessity, we now have the opportunity to explore innovative approaches that might inform the future of HF care delivery in Canada. Herein, we provide perspectives from leadership within the Canadian Heart Failure Society on how to optimize HF care during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Virani, Sean A; Clarke, Brian; Ducharme, Anique; Ezekowitz, Justin A; Heckman, George A; McDonald, Michael; Mielniczuk, Lisa Marie; Swiggum, Elizabeth; Van Spall, Harriete G C; Zieroth, Shelley",Can J Cardiol,,450

Sleep may be adversely affected by stressful circumstances that jeopardize general health. Hence, the impact of home confinement on the sleep efficiency of the general population was assessed. An online survey was conducted by using the Pittsburgh sleep quality index (PSQI) to assess sleep duration, sleep efficiency, latency to fall asleep, and global PSQI score. Questions pertaining to demography, home confinement, and anxiety were included. Data was collected from the residents of the Southwestern region from April 15, 2020 to May 15, 2020. Data were analyzed through bivariate, multivariate logistic regression, and independent t tests. A total of 593 subjects responded to the survey. Males (OR 1.92 [1.3–2.7], p &lt; 0.001), and subjects aged ≥51 years (OR 2.49 [1.3–4.4], p = 0.002) were more likely to be poor sleepers (&lt;6 h). In hypertensive subjects, inadequate sleep was twice as high (OR 2.2 [1.1–4.4], p &lt; 0.05) than other comorbidities. Males were less likely to have sleep latency (OR 0.58 [0.40–0.86], p = 0.005) but smoking increased the latency of falling asleep (OR 2.41 [1.47–4.0], p &lt; 0.001). Sleep duration was significantly influenced by home confinement (p = 0.002), whereas sleep duration (p = 0.001), latency (p = 0.018), sleep efficiency (p = 0.005), and global PSQI scores (p = 0.005) were significantly affected by anxiety. In the southwestern region, we found sleep influenced by anxiety about COVID-19. Community pharmacists are the most accessible health care professionals and could play a pivotal role in educating the lay public on the importance of sleep hygiene through posters displayed in pharmacies and with the help of public education material.","Alqahtani, S.

Our group of clinicians and nurses developed and recorded short video messages to encourage viewers to stay home for the Thanksgiving and Christmas Holidays. We then conducted a two-stage clustered randomized controlled trial in 820 counties (covering 13 States) in the United States of a large-scale Facebook ad campaign disseminating these messages. In the first level of randomization, we randomly divided the counties into two groups: high intensity and low intensity. In the second level, we randomly assigned zip codes to either treatment or control such that 75% of zip codes in high intensity counties received the treatment, while 25% of zip codes in low intensity counties received the treatment. In each treated zip code, we sent the ad to as many Facebook subscribers as possible (11,954,109 users received at least one ad at Thanksgiving and 23,302,290 users received at least one ad at Christmas). The first primary outcome was aggregate holiday travel, measured using mobile phone location data, available at the county level: we find that average distance travelled in high-intensity counties decreased by -0.993 percentage points (95% CI -1.616, -0.371, p-value 0.002) the three days before each holiday. The second primary outcome was COVID-19 infection at the zip-code level: COVID-19 infections recorded in the two-week period starting five days post-holiday declined by 3.5 percent (adjusted 95% CI [-6.2 percent, -0.7 percent], p-value 0.013) in intervention zip codes compared to control zip codes.

Among the human coronaviruses, highly pathogenic ones are Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) which have been implicated in severe respiratory syndrome in humans. There are no approved antiviral drugs or vaccines for the treatment of human CoV infection to date. The recent outbreak of new coronavirus pandemic, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has caused a high mortality rate and infections around the world which necessitates the need for the discovery of novel anti-coronaviral drugs. Among the coronaviruses proteins, 3C-like protease (3CL pro) is an important drug target against coronaviral infection as the auto-cleavage process catalysed by the enzyme is crucial for viral maturation and replication. The present work is aimed at the identification of suitable lead molecules for the inhibition of 3CL proenzyme via a computational screening of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved antiviral drugs and phytochemicals. Based on binding energies and molecular interaction studies, we shortlisted five lead molecules (both FDA approved drugs and phytochemicals) for each enzyme targets (SARS-CoV-2 3CL pro, SARS-CoV 3CL proand MERS-CoV 3CL pro). The lead molecules showed higher binding affinity compared to the standard inhibitors and exhibited favourable hydrophobic interactions and a good number of hydrogen bonds with their respective targets. A few promising leads with dual inhibition potential were identified among FDA approved antiviral drugs which include DB13879 (Glecaprevir), DB09102 (Daclatasvir), molecule DB09297 (Paritaprevir) and DB01072 (Atazanavir). Among the phytochemicals, 11,646,359 (Vincapusine), 120,716 (Alloyohimbine) and 10,308,017 (Gummadiol) showed triple inhibition potential against all the three targets and 102,004,710 (18-Hydroxy-3-epi-alpha-yohimbine) exhibited dual inhibition potential. Hence, the proposed lead molecules from our findings can be further investigated through in vitro and in vivo studies to develop into potential drug candidates against human coronaviral infections.","Bahadur Gurung, Arun; Ajmal Ali, Mohammad; Lee, Joongku; Abul Farah, Mohammad; Mashay Al-Anazi, Khalid",J.

Data relevant to participants’ experiences and views regarding telemental health during the pandemic were identified and extracted. Data collection and analysis used a participatory, coproduction approach where researchers with relevant lived experience, contributed to all stages of data collection, analysis and interpretation of findings alongside clinical and academic researchers. FINDINGS: The experiences and preferences regarding telemental health care of the forty-four participants were dynamic and varied across time and settings, as well as between individuals. Participants’ preferences were shaped by reasons for contacting services, their relationship with care providers, and both parties’ access to technology and their individual preferences. While face-to-face care tended to be the preferred option, participants identified benefits of remote care including making care more accessible for some populations and improved efficiency for functional appointments such as prescription reviews. Participants highlighted important challenges related to safety and privacy in online settings, and gave examples of good remote care strategies they had experienced, including services scheduling regular phone calls and developing guidelines about how to access remote care tools. DISCUSSION: Participants in our study have highlighted advantages of telemental health care, as well as significant limitations that risk hindering mental health support and exacerbate inequalities in access to services. Some of these limitations are seen as potentially removable, for example through staff training or better digital access for staff or service users. Others indicate a need to maintain traditional face-to-face contact at least for some appointments. There is a clear need for care to be flexible and individualised to service user circumstances and preferences. Further research is needed on ways of minimising digital exclusion and of supporting staff in making effective and collaborative use of relevant technologies.","Vera San Juan, Norha; Shah, Prisha; Schlief, Merle; Appleton, Rebecca; Nyikavaranda, Patrick; Birken, Mary; Foye, Una; Lloyd-Evans, Brynmor; Morant, Nicola; Needle, Justin J.; Simpson, Alan; Lyons, Natasha; Rains, Luke Sheridan; Dedat, Zainab; Johnson, Sonia",PLoS One,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0257270; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34529705/,450

The newly emerged severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) has become a worldwide pandemic. To address the role that animals may play in the evolution of SARS-CoV-2, the full genome sequences of SARS-CoV-2 isolated from animals were compared with SARS-CoV-2 human isolates from the same clade and geographic region. Phylogenetic analysis of SARS-CoV-2 isolated from the cat, dog, mink, mouse, and tiger revealed a close relationship with SARS-CoV-2 human isolates from the same clade and geographic region with sequence identities of 99.94–99.99%. The deduced amino acid sequence of spike (S) protein revealed the presence of a furin cleavage site ((682)RRAR▾(685)), which did not differ among all SARS-CoV-2 isolates from animals and humans. SARS-CoV-2 isolates from minks exhibited two amino acid substitutions (G261D, A262S) in the N-terminal domain of S protein and four (L452M, Y453F, F486L, N501T) in the receptor-binding motif (RBM). In the mouse, the S protein had two amino acid substitutions, one in the RBM (Q498H) and the other (N969S) in the heptad repeat 1. SARS-CoV-2 isolated from minks furtherly exhibited three unique amino acid substitutions in the nucleocapsid (N)protein. In the cat, two unique amino acid substitutions were discovered in the N (T247I) and matrix (T175M) proteins. Additionally, SARS-CoV-2 isolated from minks possessed sixteen, four, and two unique amino acid substitutions in the open reading frame 1ab (ORF1ab), ORF3a, and ORF6, respectively. Dog and cat SARS-CoV-2 isolates showed one and seven unique amino acid substitutions in ORF1ab, respectively. Further studies may be necessary to determine the pathogenic significance of these amino acid substitutions to understand the molecular epidemiology and evolution of SARS-CoV-2.","Elaswad, Ahmed; Fawzy, Mohamed; Basiouni, Shereen; Shehata, Awad A.",PeerJ,https://doi.org/10.7717/peerj.10609; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33384909/,450

While research on this topic has focused primarily on injuries, there are multiple mechanisms by which e-scooter share programs may impact health. The aim of this study is to explore the health-related behaviors of e-scooter users and to discuss their implications for public health. Data were collected using an online survey emailed to registered e-scooter users. A total of 1070 users completed the survey. Descriptive variable statistics and chi-squared analysis were performed to determine variable dependent relationships and equality of proportions. The most common destinations reported were “just riding around for fun”, home, and dining/shopping. The two most common modes of transportation that would have been used if e-scooters were not available were walking (43.5%) and using a personal vehicle (28.5%). Riding behavior was equally mixed between on the street, on the sidewalk, and equal amounts of both. e-Scooters in Provo are likely having both positive (e.g., air pollution) and negative impacts on health (e.g., injuries, physical inactivity). Future research should further explore patterns of e-scooter use and explicitly examine the linkages between e-scooters and areas of health beyond just injuries.","Glenn, Jeffrey; Bluth, Madeline; Christianson, Mannon; Pressley, Jaymie; Taylor, Austin; Macfarlane, Gregory S.; Chaney, Robert A.",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32878295/; https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph17176344,450

Asthma is a complex persistent inflammatory disorder of the airways characterized by reversible airflow obstruction and, from a long-term perspective, airway remodeling. Overall, mechanistic studies summarized here indicate the importance of different subtypes of EVs and their variable cargoes in the functioning of the pathways underlying asthma, and show some interesting potential for the development of future therapeutic interventions.

METHODS: This was a cross‐sectional study conducted in the Nabdam district, Ghana. Data were collected from 527 pregnant women randomly selected from antenatal care clinics from 16 healthcare facilities. Descriptive statistics were used to assess the prevalence of adherence to COVID‐19 preventive measures. Multivariable logistic regression was used to estimate the factors associated with COVID‐19 preventive measures, whilst adjusting for potential confounders. RESULTS: The prevalence of wearing a face mask 18.0% (95% CI: 14.73%, 21.32%); of handwashing/hand sanitising 31.7% (95% CI: 27.70%, 35.67%), and of social distancing, 22.0% (95% CI: 18.46%, 25.56%). Multivariable logistic regression analysis revealed that knowledge of COVID‐19 symptoms [Adjusted odds ratios (aOR): 2.86, 95% CI: 1.03, 7.89] and knowledge of COVID‐19 transmission via contaminated surfaces/objects (aOR: 4.60, 95% CI: 1.23, 17.18) were associated with wearing a face mask. Pregnant women who knew that avoiding the touching of eyes, nose and mouth can prevent COVID‐19 (aOR: 2.71, 95% CI: 1.01, 7.28), and knowledge of the virus being transmitted via contaminated objects/surfaces (aOR: 4.08, 95% CI: 1.42, 11.76), were associated with handwashing/hand sanitising.

628663,SARS-CoV-2 concentrations in a wastewater collection system indicated potential COVID-19 hotspots at the zip code level,2021-08-03,"The increasing use of personal protective equipment (PPE) as a sanitary measure against the new coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) has become a significant source of many environmental risks. The majority of the governments enforce the use of PPE in public areas, such as beaches. Thus, the use and disposal of PPE have compromised most solid waste management strategies, ultimately leading to the occurrence of PPE polluting the marine environment. The present study aimed to monitor the PPE pollution associated with COVID-19 along the coastline of Agadir, Morocco. In parallel, the influence of the activities carried out in each sampled beach before and after the lockdown break was reported. Overall, a total number of 689 PPE items were identified, with a mean density of 1.13 × 10(−5) PPE m(−2) (0–1.21 × 10(−4) PPE m(−2)). The majority of the PPE items found were face masks (96.81%), out of which 98.4% were surgical masks and 1.6% were reusable cloth masks. The most polluted sites were the beaches with recreational activities, followed by surfing, and fishing as the main activity. Importantly, PPE density increased significantly after lockdown measures. Additionally, the discarded PPE sampled in the supralittoral zone was higher than PPE recorded in the intertidal zone. This confirms that PPE items are driven by the beachgoers during their visit. PPE items are a source of microplastic and chemical pollutants, a substrate to invasive species colonization, and a potential threat of entanglement, ingestion, and/or infection among apex predators. In the specific case of Agadir beaches, significant efforts are required to work on the lack of environmental awareness and education. It is recommended to improve beach cleaning strategies and to penalize incorrect PPE disposal. Additional alternatives may be adopted, as the involvement of biodegradable materials in PPE manufacturing, recycling through pyrolysis, and encouraging reusable and washable masks.","Haddad, Mohamed Ben; De-la-Torre, Gabriel E.; Abelouah, Mohamed Rida; Hajji, Sara; Alla, Aicha Ait",Sci Total Environ,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0048969721043552; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34332387/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969721043552?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.149282,450

For countries at risk of introduction of H7N9, such as Vietnam, early detection of H7N9 virus is essential for the early containment of the virus. Insulated isothermal reverse transcriptase PCR (iiRT‐PCR) is a portable PCR system that can be deployed under field conditions to identify pathogens at the sampling site. Applying PCR at the sampling site will greatly reduce the time to obtain a diagnostic result which allows the veterinary authority to take immediate action to contain disease spreading. OBJECTIVE: To determine analytical and diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of the portable iiRT‐PCR for H7N9 virus detection. METHODS: A panel of 59 virus isolates, including H7N9, avian influenza viruses of subtype H1 to H13, swine and human influenza viruses, Newcastle disease virus, and infectious bursal disease virus, were tested by H7 and N9 iiRT‐PCR reagents, using probes and primers specific to H7 or N9, in comparison with laboratory‐based real‐time RT‐PCR assays to determine analytical sensitivity and specificity. Fifty oropharyngeal samples from experimentally infected chicken and ducks with H7N9 and 50 non‐infected control swabs were tested by the H7 iiRT‐PCR to determine diagnostic sensitivity and specificity. RESULTS: The H7 and N9 iiRT‐PCR reagents yielded comparable levels of analytical sensitivity and specificity with real‐time RT‐PCR for the detection of H7N9 virus. Diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of H7 iiRT‐PCR were 98% and 100%, respectively. CONCLUSION: The observed high sensitivity and specificity of iiRT‐PCR for H7N9 detection show its potential for early detection of H7N9 in risk‐based surveillance.","Inui, Ken; Nguyen, Tung; Tseng, Hsin‐Jou; Tsai, ChuanFu Mark; Tsai, Yun‐Long; Chung, Simon; Padungtod, Pawin; Zhu, Huachen; Guan, Yi; Kalpravidh, Wantanee; Claes, Filip",Influenza Other Respir Viruses,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31487118/; https://doi.org/10.1111/irv.12646,450

However, traditional and novel antiviral discovery approaches are unable to mitigate them in a timely manner. Notably, drug repurposing emerged as an alternative strategy to provide antiviral solutions in a timely and cost-effective manner. In the literature, many FDA-approved drugs have been repurposed to inhibit viruses, while a few among them have also entered clinical trials. Using experimental data, we identified repurposed drugs against 14 viruses responsible for causing epidemics and pandemics such as SARS-CoV-2, SARS, Middle East respiratory syndrome, influenza H1N1, Ebola, Zika, Nipah, chikungunya, and others. We developed a novel computational “drug-target-drug” approach that uses the drug targets extracted for specific drugs, which are experimentally validated in vitro or in vivo for antiviral activity. Furthermore, these extracted drug targets were used to fetch the novel FDA-approved drugs for each virus and prioritize them by calculating their confidence scores. Pathway analysis showed that the majority of the extracted targets are involved in cancer and signaling pathways. For SARS-CoV-2, our method identified 21 potential repurposed drugs, of which 7 (e.g., baricitinib, ramipril, chlorpromazine, enalaprilat, etc.) have already entered clinical trials. The prioritized drug candidates were further validated using a molecular docking approach. Therefore, we anticipate success during the experimental validation of our predicted FDA-approved repurposed drugs against 14 viruses. This study will assist the scientific community in hastening research aimed at the development of antiviral therapeutics.","Rajput, Akanksha; Thakur, Anamika; Rastogi, Amber; Choudhury, Shubham; Kumar, Manoj",Comput Biol Med,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.compbiomed.2021.104677; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34332351/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010482521004716?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0010482521004716,450

Typically, T1D is thought to occur as a result of autoimmunity toward islets of Langerhans, resulting in the destruction of insulin-producing cells (β cells) and thus lifelong reliance on exogenous insulin. However, that explanation obscures much of the underlying mechanism, and the actual precipitating events along with the associated actors (latent viral infection, diverse immune cell types and their roles) are not completely understood. Notably, there is a malfunctioning in the regulation of cytotoxic CD8+ T cells that target endocrine cells through antigen-mediated attack. Further examination has revealed the likelihood of an imbalance in distinct subpopulations of tolerogenic and cytotoxic natural killer (NK) cells that may be the catalyst of adaptive immune system malfunction. The contributions of components outside the immune system, including environmental factors such as chronic viral infection also need more consideration, and much of the recent literature investigating the origins of this disease have focused on these factors. In this review, the details of the immunopathology of T1D regarding NK cell disfunction is discussed, along with how those mechanisms stand within the context of general autoimmune disorders.

Additionally, our analysis assesses the cushioning effect of discretionary fiscal policy measures taken by the EU Member States. We find that the COVID-19 pandemic is likely to affect significantly households’ disposable income in the EU, with lower income households being more severely hit. However, our results show that due to policy intervention, the impact of the crisis is expected to be similar to the one experienced during the 2008–2009 financial crisis. In detail, our results indicate that discretionary fiscal policy measures will play a significant cushioning role, reducing the size of the income loss (from −9.3% to −4.3% for the average equivalised disposable income), its regressivity and mitigating the poverty impact of the pandemic.

643301,First detection of SARS-CoV-2 in untreated wastewaters in Italy,2020-05-23,"Surgical resection is a common therapeutic option for primary solid tumors. However, high cancer recurrence and metastatic rates after resection are the main cause of cancer related mortalities. This implies the existence of a “fertile soil” following surgery that facilitates colonization by circulating cancer cells. Myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) are essential for premetastatic niche formation, and may persist in distant organs for up to 2 weeks after surgery. These postsurgical persistent lung MDSCs exhibit stronger immunosuppression compared with presurgical MDSCs, suggesting that surgery enhances MDSC function. Surgical stress and trauma trigger the secretion of systemic inflammatory cytokines, which enhance MDSC mobilization and proliferation. Additionally, damage associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) directly activate MDSCs through pattern recognition receptor-mediated signals. Surgery also increases vascular permeability, induces an increase in lysyl oxidase and extracellular matrix remodeling in lungs, that enhances MDSC mobilization. Postsurgical therapies that inhibit the induction of premetastatic niches by MDSCs promote the long-term survival of patients. Cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors and β-blockade, or their combination, may minimize the impact of surgical stress on MDSCs. Anti-DAMPs and associated inflammatory signaling inhibitors also are potential therapies. Existing therapies under tumor-bearing conditions, such as MDSCs depletion with low-dose chemotherapy or tyrosine kinase inhibitors, MDSCs differentiation using all-trans retinoic acid, and STAT3 inhibition merit clinical evaluation during the perioperative period. In addition, combining low-dose epigenetic drugs with chemokine receptors, reversing immunosuppression through the Enhanced Recovery After Surgery protocol, repairing vascular leakage, or inhibiting extracellular matrix remodeling also may enhance the long-term survival of curative resection patients.","Tang, Fan; Tie, Yan; Hong, Weiqi; Wei, Yuquan; Tu, Chongqi; Wei, Xiawei",Ann Surg Oncol,https://doi.org/10.1245/s10434-020-09371-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33258011/,450
645358,Intermittent occupancy combined with ventilation: An efficient strategy for the reduction of airborne transmission indoors,2020-07-15,"BACKGROUND: Female breast cancer was the most diagnosed cancer in 2020, with more than two million new cases worldwide. Access to scientifically correct information can assist patients in early detection or prevention of the disease. However, misinformation on social networking sites (SNSs) about breast cancer can be propagated rapidly, posing a threat to health communication efforts. The aim of this study is to analyse the characteristics of the most shared news stories referencing the disease that circulated on SNSs, including the credibility of this content. METHODS: This is an exploratory quali-quantitative study. Data collection was conducted between June 2019 and June 2020. We performed statistical and content analysis of the stories that had at least 1,000 total shares. Each story was classified in accordance to the following aspects: credibility; type of rumour; source; content type; mentions prevention or early detection/screening exams. RESULTS: The abundance of news stories in our sample (n = 1,594) were not classified according to their credibility, as they do not address science, risk factors, prevention, treatment, or other aspects which can be assessed for scientific accuracy. However, content classified as “rumours” are 3.29 times more shared than those considered scientifically correct. Regarding content type, most stories are classified as ‘real-life story’ or ‘solidarity’ (67.69%). In our sample, 5.08% of the total comment on prevention and 19.7% reference early detection. CONCLUSION: We consider it can be a good strategy, in SNSs, to combine content of greater popularity, such as real-life stories, with subjects that can make a difference in a patient’s life, such as early detection, breast cancer symptoms and disease prevention strategies. Doctors, scientists and health journalists can expand the dialogue with the lay public regarding breast cancer, helping to counteract online misinformation.","Biancovilli, Priscila; Makszin, Lilla; Csongor, Alexandra",BMC Womens Health,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12905-021-01352-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33992111/,450

We investigate to what extent perceived work stressors relate to psychological strain through perceptions of social support, work–life conflict, and adjustment to remote work. The findings expound the mechanisms underlying psychological strain in the context of sudden organizational change. Specifically, this study shows that both challenge stressors and hindrance stressors have negative impact on adjustment to remote work, whereas hindrance stressors are more strongly negatively related to social support. The study further demonstrates that there is hardly any buffering impact of job control, work structuring, and communication technology use on the implications of these work stressors. These findings contribute to our theoretical understanding and provide actionable implications for organizational policies in facilitating employees' adaptation to remote work.","van Zoonen, Ward; Sivunen, Anu; Blomqvist, Kirsimarja; Olsson, Thomas; Ropponen, Annina; Henttonen, Kaisa; Vartiainen, Matti",Journal of Management & Organization,https://doi.org/10.1017/jmo.2021.50,450

649736,Community-level SARS-CoV-2 sequence diversity revealed by wastewater sampling,2021-08-18,"Introduction: COVID-19 has transformed stem cell transplantation (HSCT) dynamics throughout the world. Bone Marrow Transplantation units are facing many challenges complicating admission; deferrals in transplant schedules and even temporary closure. Delay in treatment may have a negative impact in outcomes. Outpatient care has been an alternative to hospital care in patients undergoing HSCT since the 1990s. Potential advantages include improved patient independence and satisfaction, improved quality of life, and less hospital resource utilization, which is of particular importance during this epidemic. In this prospective cohort study, we investigated the impact of the pandemic in our outpatient HSCT program. Objective: To describe the outcomes of patients undergoing ambulatory HSCT during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: Adults and children with any hematological disease undergoing any type of HSCT with an outpatient intent from March to July 2020 were included. All were required to have a Karnofsky score >70%, serum creatinine <2 mg/dL, temporary residence near the hospital, an adequate caregiver, with appropriate educational level and history of treatment adherence. All cases lacked alternative therapies and were discussed thoroughly and approved by our transplant committee. After infusion, patients stayed at home and were seen in the outpatient clinic every other day until hospitalization requirement or engraftment; afterward weekly and bi-weekly through day +100. Patients were instructed to stay at home isolation 14 days before the procedure, and to report the presence of fever, to notify any COVID-19 contact or symptoms including cough, rhinorrhea, conjunctivitis, diarrhea, and anosmia. All patients and caregivers were screened with questionnaires according to the updated COVID-19 case definition. Hand and respiratory hygiene were recommended for donors, receptors, and health workers. Proper personal protective equipment was used according to WHO guidelines. Only a single caregiver was allowed during outpatient visits and hospitalization. Results: Since the beginning of COVID-19 pandemic in Mexico (February 28th 2020) 21 HSCT have been conducted with ambulatory intent. Fourteen allogeneic (allo-HSCT, 66.6%) (10 haploidentical, 4 matched related donors) and 7 autologous (auto-HSCT) (33.3%%) transplants have been performed. The median age was 27 years (range, 3-70) for allogeneic HSCT and 30 years for autologous (range, 2-63). Acute leukemia (5 lymphoblastic, 5 myeloblastic) was the most common indication for allo-HSCT, and multiple myeloma for auto-HSCT. PCR for SARS-Cov2 was tested only in 1 receptor before the transplant, due to prior test unavailability in asymptomatic persons. Engraftment was achieved in all patients. All received conditioning as outpatients. Twelve (57.4%) were never hospitalized (4/7 auto and 8/14 allo-HSCT) with a median age of 32.5 (range, 16-70). For allo-HSCT median length of stay (LOS) was 2 days (range, 0-21) while for auto-HSCT was 0 days (range, 0-9). The most common reason for hospitalization was febrile neutropenia (n=6, 46%). A median of 7 visits per patient (4-14) were required until day +100 or last follow-up in the outpatient clinic and complemented with 4 (1-18) telemedicine consults. No one died from transplant related mortality. No cases of COVID19 were documented. Conclusion: Outpatient transplantation is a feasible alternative for performing HSCT during the COVID-19 pandemic minimizing the risk of infection and providing a safe environment for patients, donors, and healthcare providers.

We evaluated 9-1-1 emergency medical services (EMS) encounters for patients with COVID-19 to assess occupational exposure, programmatic strategies to reduce exposure, and PPE use. Methods We conducted a retrospective cohort investigation of lab-confirmed COVID-19 patients in King County, WA who received 9-1-1 EMS responses from February 14, 2020 to March 26, 2020. We reviewed dispatch, EMS, and public health surveillance records to evaluate the temporal relationship between exposure and programmatic changes to EMS operations designed to identify high-risk patients, protect the workforce, and conserve PPE. Results There were 274 EMS encounters for 220 unique COVID-19 patients involving 700 unique EMS providers with 988 EMS person-encounters. Use of full PPE including mask, eye protection, gown and gloves (MEGG) was 67%. There were 151 person-exposures among 129 individuals, who required 981 quarantine days. Of the 700 EMS providers, 3 (0.4%) tested positive within 14 days of encounter. Programmatic changes were associated with a temporal reduction in exposures. When stratified at the study encounters midpoint, 94% (142/151) of exposures occurred during the first 137 EMS encounters compared to 6% (9/151) during the second 137 EMS encounters (p<0.01). By the final week of the study period, EMS deployed MEGG PPE in 34% (3579/10,468) of all EMS person-encounters. Conclusion Less than 0.5% of EMS providers experienced COVID-19 illness within 14 days of occupational encounter.

Whereas some patients have only mild symptoms of short duration, others develop severe disease that leads to acute respiratory distress syndrome requiring prolonged stays in intensive care units. Radiologically, the initial stage is characterized by viral pneumonia with mild expression. In some patients, however, the onset of the immune response results in acute lung damage with organizing pneumonia and diffuse alveolar damage. Moderate-severe disease is associated with a high incidence of pulmonary embolisms, generally peripherally distributed and associated with endothelial damage, prolonged stays in bed, and coagulopathy. Other relatively common complications are spontaneous pneumothorax and pneumomediastinum due to the rupture of alveolar walls and barotrauma in mechanically ventilated patients. Superinfection, generally bacterial and less commonly fungal, is more common in patients with severe disease.","Parra Gordo, M. L.; Weiland, G. Buitrago; García, M. Grau; Choperena, G.

V.",2020-11-10,"PURPOSE: The Covid-19 pandemic is a public health emergency with both physical and mental health risks. Medical students have baseline elevated rates of anxiety, depression and burnout. As such, they may be especially susceptible to the psychological stresses of Covid-19. The current study aimed to evaluate the prevalence of anxiety and depression among United States medical students during the Covid-19 pandemic. METHODS: A cross-sectional, survey-based study collected demographic data as well as the 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7) and the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) to assess anxiety and depression symptoms, respectively. The survey was administered from April 13, 2020 to April 28, 2020 amidst the height of the Covid-19 pandemic. RESULTS: A total of 1,428 students from 40 US medical schools completed the survey. From those surveyed, 30.6% and 24.3% of respondents screened positive for anxiety and depression, respectively. Median GAD-7 scores were higher among females (7.0 vs 5.0, P < .00001), pre-clinical students (7.0 vs 6.0, P < .00004), and those with a friend or relative diagnosed with Covid-19 (7.0 vs 6.0, P=.001). Median PHQ-9 scores were higher among females (6.0 vs 4.0, P < .00001) and pre-clinical students (6.0 vs 4.0, P < .00001). CONCLUSION: When compared to previous medical student studies, these results are 61% higher for anxiety and 70% higher for depression during the Covid-19 era. The current study suggests that there should be a heightened awareness of and sensitivity to student’s mental health during the Covid-19 pandemic with certain cohorts at greater potential risk.","Halperin, Scott J; Henderson, Matthew N; Prenner, Sofia; Grauer, Jonathan N",J Med Educ Curric Dev,https://doi.org/10.1177/2382120521991150; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33644399/,450
660925,Immunodominance complexity: lessons yet to be learned from dominant T cell responses to SARS- COV-2,2021-09-08,"BACKGROUND: Single-cell (sc) sequencing performs unbiased profiling of individual cells and enables evaluation of less prevalent cellular populations, often missed using bulk sequencing. However, the scale and the complexity of the sc datasets poses a great challenge in its utility and this problem is further exacerbated when working with larger datasets typically generated by consortium efforts. As the scale of single cell datasets continues to increase exponentially, there is an unmet technological need to develop database platforms that can evaluate key biological hypotheses by querying extensive single-cell datasets. Large single-cell datasets like Human Cell Atlas and COVID-19 cell atlas (collection of annotated sc datasets from various human organs) are excellent resources for profiling target genes involved in human diseases and disorders ranging from oncology, auto-immunity, as well as infectious diseases like COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2 virus. SARS-CoV-2 infections have led to a worldwide pandemic with massive loss of lives, infections exceeding 7 million cases. The virus uses ACE2 and TMPRSS2 as key viral entry associated proteins expressed in human cells for infections. Evaluating the expression profile of key genes in large single-cell datasets can facilitate testing for diagnostics, therapeutics, and vaccine targets, as the world struggles to cope with the on-going spread of COVID-19 infections. MAIN BODY: In this manuscript we describe REVEAL: SingleCell, which enables storage, retrieval, and rapid query of single-cell datasets inclusive of millions of cells. The array native database described here enables selecting and analyzing cells across multiple studies. Cells can be selected using individual metadata tags, more complex hierarchical ontology filtering, and gene expression threshold ranges, including co-expression of multiple genes. The tags on selected cells can be further evaluated for testing biological hypotheses. One such example includes identifying the most prevalent cell type annotation tag on returned cells. We used REVEAL: SingleCell to evaluate the expression of key SARS-CoV-2 entry associated genes, and queried the current database (2.2 Million cells, 32 projects) to obtain the results in < 60 s. We highlighted cells expressing COVID-19 associated genes are expressed on multiple tissue types, thus in part explains the multi-organ involvement in infected patients observed worldwide during the on-going COVID-19 pandemic. CONCLUSION: In this paper, we introduce the REVEAL: SingleCell database that addresses immediate needs for SARS-CoV-2 research and has the potential to be used more broadly for many precision medicine applications. We used the REVEAL: SingleCell database as a reference to ask questions relevant to drug development and precision medicine regarding cell type and co-expression for genes that encode proteins necessary for SARS-CoV-2 to enter and reproduce in cells.

These individuals are also at the greatest risk for morbidity and mortality from SARS‐CoV‐2 infection. SARS‐CoV‐2 complications include cytokine storm and multiorgan failure mediated by the same factors as often produced by SnCs through their senescence‐associated secretory phenotype (SASP). The SASP can be amplified by infection‐related pathogen‐associated molecular profile factors. Senolytic agents, such as Fisetin, selectively eliminate SnCs and delay, prevent, or alleviate multiple disorders in aged experimental animals and animal models of human chronic diseases, including obesity, diabetes, and respiratory diseases. Senolytics are now in clinical trials for multiple conditions linked to SnCs, including frailty; obesity/diabetes; osteoporosis; and cardiovascular, kidney, and lung diseases, which are also risk factors for SARS‐CoV‐2 morbidity and mortality. A clinical trial is underway to test if senolytics decrease SARS‐CoV‐2 progression and morbidity in hospitalized older adults. We describe here a National Institutes of Health‐funded, multicenter, placebo‐controlled clinical trial of Fisetin for older adult skilled nursing facility (SNF) residents who have been, or become, SARS‐CoV‐2 rtPCR‐positive, including the rationale for targeting fundamental aging mechanisms in such patients. We consider logistic challenges of conducting trials in long‐term care settings in the SARS‐CoV‐2 era, including restricted access, consent procedures, methods for obtaining biospecimens and clinical data, staffing, investigational product administration issues, and potential solutions for these challenges.

The government and hospitals have taken robust measures to curb the spread of the deadly virus. Its impact on routine medical services is gradually being taken seriously. OBJECTIVE To identify the impact of the novel coronavirus pandemic on emergency department (ED) patient flow and the performance of the routine ED service. METHODS This retrospective cohort study was undertaken in a tertiary public teaching hospital ED in Chengdu, China. ED data of patients were routinely collected to compare demographic, clinical characteristics, and outcomes during an 8-week period from January 1st to February 25th in 2019 and 2020. Data were analyzed with the Chi-square statistical test. RESULTS Over the study periods, there were 31,855 and 25,244 patients presented to the ED in 2019 and 2020 respectively. During the pandemic period in 2020, the daily number of average ED visits was lower than that in 2019 (430±134.9v.s. 572±38.6, p=0.00), with fewer triage 1&2 cases (145±33.3 v.s.178±15.0, p=0.00). Nevertheless, the mortality increased remarkably during the pandemic period in 2020 (0.2% vs. 0.1%, p=0.009), with higher APACHE II scores (28 vs.19, p= 0.022) and shorter ED elapsed time (0.2 vs. 1.4 days, p=0.016) among these death cases.

667866,Mitteilungen der DGN,2020-06-12,"Although pork producers typically aim to optimize growth rates, occasionally it is necessary to slow growth, such as when harvest facility capacity is limited. In finishing pigs, numerous dietary strategies can be used to slow growth so pigs are at optimal slaughter body weights when harvest facility capacity and/or access is restored. However, the impact of these diets on pork carcass quality is largely unknown. Thus, this study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of dietary strategies to slow growth in late finishing pigs and evaluate their effects on carcass composition and pork quality. Mixed-sex pigs (n = 897; 125 ± 2 kg BW) were randomly allotted across 48 pens and assigned to 1 of 6 dietary treatments (n = 8 pens/treatment): (1) Control diet representative of a typical finisher diet (CON); (2) diet containing 3% calcium chloride (CaCl(2)); (3) diet containing 97% corn and no soybean meal (Corn); (4) diet deficient in isoleucine (LowIle); (5) diet containing 15% neutral detergent fiber (NDF) from soybean hulls (15% NDF); and (6) diet containing 20% NDF from soybean hulls (20% NDF). Over 42 d, pen body weights and feed disappearance were collected. Pigs were harvested in 3 groups (14, 28, and 42 d on feed) and carcass data collected. From the harvest group, 1 loin was collected from 120 randomly selected carcasses (20 loins/treatment) to evaluate pork quality traits. Overall, ADG was reduced in CaCl(2), Corn, and 20% NDF pigs compared with CON pigs (P < 0.001). However, ADFI was only reduced in CaCl(2) and 20% NDF pigs compared with CON (P < 0.001). Feed efficiency was reduced in CaCl(2) and Corn pigs compared with CON (P < 0.001). Hot carcass weights were reduced in CaCl(2) pigs at all harvest dates (P < 0.001) and were reduced in Corn and 20% NDF pigs at days 28 and 42 compared with CON pigs (P < 0.001). In general, CaCl(2) and 20% NDF diets resulted in leaner carcasses, whereas the Corn diet increased backfat by 42 d on test (P < 0.05). Loin pH was reduced and star probe increased in CaCl(2) pigs compared with CON pigs (P < 0.05); no treatments differed from CON pigs regarding drip loss, cook loss, color, firmness, or marbling (P ≥ 0.117). Overall, these data indicate that several dietary strategies can slow finishing pig growth without evidence of behavioral vices. However, changes to carcass composition and quality were also observed, indicating quality should be taken into consideration when choosing diets to slow growth.","Helm, Emma T; Ross, Jason W; Patience, John F; Lonergan, Steven M; Huff-Lonergan, Elisabeth; Greiner, Laura L; Reever, Leah M; Hastad, Chad W; Arkfeld, Emily K; Gabler, Nicholas K",J Anim Sci,https://doi.org/10.1093/jas/skaa368; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33394016/,450

Droplet, air, contaminated fomites, and rodent pests have been proposed to be mechanisms for transmitting SARS in a short period. We studied nasopharyngeal viral load of SARS patients on admission and their geographic distribution. Higher nasopharyngeal viral load was found in patients living in adjacent units of the same block inhabited by the index patient, while a lower but detectable nasopharyngeal viral load was found in patients living further away from the index patient. This pattern of nasopharyngeal viral load suggested that airborne transmission played an important part in this outbreak in Hong Kong. Contaminated fomites and rodent pests may have also played a role.","Chu, Chung-Ming; Cheng, Vincent C.C.; Hung, Ivan F.N.; Chan, Kin-Sang; Tang, Bone S.F.; Tsang, Thomas H.F.; Chan, Kwok-Hung; Yuen, Kwok-Yung",Emerg Infect Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16485474/,450
669107,Pflegepolitik in 5 Minuten,2021-02-05,"SARS-CoV-2 is a highly contagious virus and is causing a global pandemic. SARS-CoV-2 infection depends on the recognition of and binding to the cellular receptor human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) through the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein, and disruption of this process can effectively inhibit SARS-CoV-2 invasion. Plasma-activated water efficiently inactivates bacteria and bacteriophages by causing damage to biological macromolecules, but its effect on coronavirus has not been reported. In this study, pseudoviruses with the SARS-CoV-2 S protein were used as a model, and plasma-activated water (PAW) effectively inhibited pseudovirus infection through S protein inactivation. The RBD was used to study the molecular details, and the RBD binding activity was inactivated by plasma-activated water through the RBD modification. The short-lived reactive species in the PAW, such as ONOO(−), played crucial roles in this inactivation. Plasma-activated water after room-temperature storage of 30 days remained capable of significantly reducing the RBD binding with hACE2. Together, our findings provide evidence of a potent disinfection strategy to combat the epidemic caused by SARS-CoV-2.","Guo, Li; Yao, Zhiqian; Yang, Lu; Zhang, Hao; Qi, Yu; Gou, Lu; Xi, Wang; Liu, Dingxin; Zhang, Lei; Cheng, Yilong; Wang, Xiaohua; Rong, Mingzhe; Chen, Hailan; Kong, Michael G.",Chem Eng J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33235538/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cej.2020.127742; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1385894720338626; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1385894720338626?v=s5,450

The lack of prescribed drugs for the deadly virus has stressed the likely need to identify novel inhibitors to alleviate and stop the pandemic. In the present high throughput virtual screening study, we used in silico techniques like receptor-ligand docking, Molecular dynamic (MD), and ADME properties to screen natural compounds. It has been documented that many natural compounds display antiviral activities, including anti–SARS-CoV effect. The present study deals with compounds of Natural Product Activity and Species Source (NPASS) database with known biological activity that probably impedes the activity of six essential enzymes of the virus. Promising drug-like compounds were identified, demonstrating better docking score and binding energy for each druggable targets. After an extensive screening analysis, three novel multi-target natural compounds were predicted to subdue the activity of three/more major drug targets simultaneously. Concerning the utility of natural compounds in the formulation of many therapies, we propose these compounds as excellent lead candidates for the development of therapeutic drugs against SARS-CoV-2.","Naik, Biswajit; Gupta, Nidhi; Ojha, Rupal; Singh, Satyendra; Prajapati, Vijay Kumar; Prusty, Dhaneswar",Int J Biol Macromol,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2020.05.184; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32470577/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0141813020333419?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0141813020333419,450
676619,Detection of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater in Japan during a COVID-19 outbreak,2020-11-10,"BACKGROUND: International healthcare systems face the challenge that waiting times may create barriers to accessing medical care, and that those barriers are unequally distributed between different patient groups. The disruption of healthcare systems caused by the COVID-19 pandemic could exacerbate this already strained demand situation. Using the German healthcare system as an example, this study aims to analyze potential effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on waiting times for outpatient specialist care and to evaluate differences between individual patient groups based on their respective insurance status and the level of supply. METHODS: We conducted an experiment in which we requested appointments by telephone for different insurance statuses in regions with varying levels of supply from 908 outpatient specialist practices in Germany before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. Data from 589 collected appointments were analyzed using a linear mixed effect model. RESULTS: The data analysis revealed two main counteracting effects. First, the average waiting time has decreased for both patients with statutory (mandatory public health insurance) and private health insurance. Inequalities in access to healthcare, however, remained and were based on patients’ insurance status and the regional level of supply. Second, the probability of not receiving an appointment at all significantly increased during the pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: Patient uncertainty due to the fear of a potential COVID-19 infection may have freed up capacities in physicians’ practices, resulting in a reduction of waiting times. At the same time, the exceptional situation caused by the pandemic may have led to uncertainty among physicians, who might thus have allocated appointments less frequently. To avoid worse health outcomes in the long term due to a lack of physician visits, policymakers and healthcare providers should focus more on regular care in the current COVID-19 pandemic.","Muschol, Jennifer; Gissel, Christian",BMC Health Serv Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34635091/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12913-021-07094-9,450

WHO estimates 55,000 rabies deaths and more than 10 million PEP every year world-wide. A variety of cell-culture derived vaccines are available for prophylaxis against rabies. However, their high cost restricts their usage in developing countries, where such cases are most often encountered. This is driving the quest for newer vaccine formulations; DNA vaccines being most promising amongst them. Here, we explored strategies of antigen trafficking to various cellular compartments aiming at improving both humoral and cellular immunity. These strategies include use of signal sequences namely Tissue Plasminogen Activator (TPA), Ubiquitin (UQ) and Lysosomal-Associated Membrane Protein-1 (LAMP-1). TPA, LAMP-1 and their combination were aimed at enhancing the CD4(+) T cell and antibody response. In contrast, the UQ tag was utilized for enhancing CD8(+) response. The potency of modified DNA vaccines assessed by total antibody response, antibody isotypes, cytokine profile, neutralizing antibody titer and protection conferred against in vivo challenge; was enhanced in comparison to native unmodified vaccine, but the response elicited did not pertain to the type of target sequence and the directed arm of immunity. Interestingly, the DNA vaccines that had been designed to generate different type of immune responses yielded in effect similar response. In conclusion, our data indicate that the directing target sequence is not the exclusive deciding factor for type and extent of immune response elicited and emphasizes on the antigen dependence of immune enhancement strategies.","Kaur, Manpreet; Rai, Anant; Bhatnagar, Rakesh",Vaccine,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X0900200X; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2009.01.128; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19356616/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0264410X0900200X,450

A cross-sectional survey was conducted from 27 June to 20 July 2020, and 1222 people participated. Kruskal-Wallis test was used to identify the differences in behavioral preventive practices across different demographic categories. To identify the factors associated with the use of preventive medicines and herbal foods/products, multivariable logistic regression was performed. Most participants adopted the recommended preventive practices such as washing hands more frequently (87.5%), staying home more often (85.5%), avoiding crowds (86%), and wearing masks (91.6%). About half of the smokers reported a decreased rate of smoking during the pandemic. Also, 14.8% and 57.6% of the participants took medicines and herbal foods/products as preventive measures against Covid-19. Arsenicum album and Zinc supplements were the most commonly used preventive medicines. Gender, age, and fear of Covid-19 were significantly associated with the use of both preventive medicines and herbal products. For the management of Covid-19 related symptoms, Paracetamols, Fexofenadine, and Zinc supplements were used most often. Most participants sought information from non-medical sources while using medicines and herbal products.

Periostin has been associated with many respiratory diseases. In this study, we aimed to investigate whether periostin could be a useful new biomarker in the follow‐up and severity assessment of the disease in patients with COVID‐19 pneumonia. METHODS: In the study, 32 patients followed up during May to July 2020 because of COVID‐19 and 24 healthy controls were included. The patients were divided into two groups, namely, mild/moderate and severe, according to the severity of the disease. Serum periostin and transforming growth factor beta (TGF‐β) levels were tested using an enzyme‐linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) method using commercially available ELISA kits. RESULTS: It was observed that the periostin level was significantly higher in both mild/moderate cases and severe cases compared with the control group at first presentation. However, TGF‐β levels at first presentation were similar between the groups. CONCLUSIONS: The current manuscript may be the first one performing periostin ELISA on COVID serum, and we believe that periostin can be used as a new biomarker.","Cabalak, Mehmet; Doğan, Serdar; Bal, Tayibe; Dikmen, Nursel",Int J Clin Pract,https://doi.org/10.1111/ijcp.14728; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34396648/,450

682265,Mitteilungen der DGU,2020-05-11,"Whole genome analysis of SARS-CoV-2 is important to identify its genetic diversity. Moreover, accurate detection of SARS-CoV-2 is required for its correct diagnosis. To address these, first we have analysed publicly available 10 664 complete or near-complete SARS-CoV-2 genomes of 73 countries globally to find mutation points in the coding regions as substitution, deletion, insertion and single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) globally and country wise. In this regard, multiple sequence alignment is performed in the presence of reference sequence from NCBI. Once the alignment is done, a consensus sequence is build to analyse each genomic sequence to identify the unique mutation points as substitutions, deletions, insertions and SNPs globally, thereby resulting in 7209, 11700, 119 and 53 such mutation points respectively. Second, in such categories, unique mutations for individual countries are determined with respect to other 72 countries. In case of India, unique 385, 867, 1 and 11 substitutions, deletions, insertions and SNPs are present in 566 SARS-CoV-2 genomes while 458, 1343, 8 and 52 mutation points in such categories are common with other countries. In majority (above 10%) of virus population, the most frequent and common mutation points between global excluding India and India are L37F, P323L, F506L, S507G, D614G and Q57H in NSP6, RdRp, Exon, Spike and ORF3a respectively. While for India, the other most frequent mutation points are T1198K, A97V, T315N and P13L in NSP3, RdRp, Spike and ORF8 respectively. These mutations are further visualised in protein structures and phylogenetic analysis has been done to show the diversity in virus genomes. Third, a web application is provided for searching mutation points globally and country wise. Finally, we have identified the potential conserved region as target that belongs to the coding region of ORF1ab, specifically to the NSP6 gene. Subsequently, we have provided the primers and probes using that conserved region so that it can be used for detecting SARS-CoV-2.

686273,Mitteilungen der DGN,2021-04-07,"It has become evident that the actions of pro-inflammatory cytokines and/or the development of a cytokine storm are responsible for the occurrence of severe COVID-19 during SARS-CoV-2 infection. Although immunomodulatory mechanisms vary among viruses, the activation of multiple TLRs that occurs primarily through the recruitment of adapter proteins such as MyD88 and TRIF contributes to the induction of a cytokine storm. Based on this, controlling the robust production of pro-inflammatory cytokines by macrophages may be applicable as a cellular approach to investigate potential cytokine-targeted therapies against COVID-19. In the current study, we utilized TLR2/MyD88 and TLR3/TRIF co-activated macrophages and evaluated the anti-cytokine storm effect of the traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) formula Babaodan (BBD). An RNA-seq-based transcriptomic approach was used to determine the molecular mode of action. Additionally, we evaluated the anti-inflammatory activity of BBD in vivo using a mouse model of post-viral bacterial infection-induced pneumonia and seven severely ill COVID-19 patients. Our study reveals the protective role of BBD against excessive immune responses in macrophages, where the underlying mechanisms involve the inhibition of the NF-κB and MAPK signaling pathways. In vivo, BBD significantly inhibited the release of IL-6, thus resulting in increased survival rates in mice. Based on limited data, we demonstrated that severely ill COVID-19 patients benefited from BBD treatment due to a reduction in the overproduction of IL-6. In conclusion, our study indicated that BBD controls excessive immune responses and may thus represent a cytokine-targeted agent that could be considered to treating COVID-19.","Qian, Jing; Xu, Hangdi; Lv, Dongqing; Liu, Wei; Chen, Enguo; Zhou, Yong; Wang, Yi; Ying, Kejing; Fan, Xiaohui",Biomed Pharmacother,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biopha.2021.111586; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33866132/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0753332221003711; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0753332221003711?v=s5,450
