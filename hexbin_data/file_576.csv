RHD Action was launched to amplify global efforts to control RHD in 2015 by World Heart Federation and Reach, with demonstration projects in Uganda and Tanzania, and support from Medtronic Foundation. The Small Grants Programme focuses on three domains: People and Communities, Medicines and Technologies, and Systems and Services. It is designed to support patient and community groups in promoting awareness, advocacy, and to build health workers’ capacity to prevent and treat RHD in LMICs. Our study evaluates the impact and effectiveness of the RHD Action Small Grants Programme. Methods: We conducted a mixed method study that involved both quantitative and qualitative surveys, through phone interviews and online surveys amongst the grant beneficiaries, to assess the impact and effectiveness of the small grant programme. An invitation to complete an online survey, using a Google Forms format, was issued to Small Grant Project Directors and Co-Directors that received funding for projects between 2017 and 2019. The online survey requested basic project information using tick boxes, Likert scales, and short answer open-ended questions about successes and challenges faced by recipients. The questionnaire also addressed recipients’ experience with the RHD Action Small Grants process – applying for the grant, nature and quality of support received to carry out project, the reporting process, and any media coverage provided. For the phone interviews, responses to the short-answer questions were used as the basis for follow up phone interviews. The discussions were recorded, transcribed and thematically analysed for new and recurring themes emerging from the in-depth discussions. Initiated in 2017, RHD Action has funded 21 proposals from a pool of 60 submissions. Recipient countries include Zambia, Uganda (2), Namibia, Kenya, Malawi (2), Egypt, Ethiopia, Nigeria (3), Rwanda (2), Mozambique, and Cameroon (2) as well as Fiji (2), the Philippines and Nepal. Five recipients were funded in 2017, eight in 2018 and eight in 2019. Project directors are primarily junior doctors and project managers supervised by senior mentors. In most cases, this is their first funding award. These projects have demonstrated tangible impact and have provided content for first manuscript and abstract submissions and presentations at professional conferences. Grant reports are presented as website stories showcasing the achievements of small local efforts with meaningful impact. For RHD Action, there is large return on a modest monetary investment resulting in a very visible, viable global RHD networking platform for enthusiastic community and provider activists.","Abdullahi, Leila; Albertus, Cleo; Perkins, Susan; Ralston, Kate; White, Alastair; Mwangi, Jeremiah; Zühlke, Liesl J.",,576,20

Specific primers for each of the 3 RNA viruses, North American genotype porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus, Japanese encephalitis virus, and swine influenza virus, were used in the testing procedure. The assay was shown to be highly sensitive because it could detect as little as 10(−5) ng of each of the respective amplicons in a single sample containing a composite of all 3 viruses. The assay was also effective in detecting one or more of the same viruses in various combinations in specimens, including lymph nodes, lungs, spleens, and tonsils, collected from clinically ill pigs and in spleen specimens collected from aborted pig fetuses. The results from the multiplex RT-PCR were confirmed by virus isolation. The relative efficiency (compared to the efficiency of separate assays for each virus) and apparent sensitivity of the multiplex RT-PCR method show that this method has potential for application in routine molecular diagnostic procedures.","CHEN, Hong-ying; WEI, Zhan-yong; ZHANG, Hong-ying; LÜ, Xiao-li; ZHENG, Lan-lan; CUI, Bao-an; LIU, Jinpeng; ZHU, Qian-lei; WANG, Zi-xin",Agric,576,1

METHODS Multicentre randomised case-control study that involved 18 patients with COVID-19 related anosmia or severe hyposmia for more than 30 days. Nine patients were prescribed systemic prednisone and nasal irrigation with betamethasone, ambroxol and rinazine for 15 days. The other 9, untreated, patients were used as controls. The olfactory function was evaluated with CCCRC test at 20 and 40 days from the first evaluation. RESULTS In the control group, a median olfactory score of 20 (IQR 30) was detected at baseline. At the 20-day control there was no significant improvement in olfactory function. The improvement in olfactory performance became significant at the 40-day follow-up compared to baseline scores [60 (IQR 60) versus 20 (IQR 30)]. In the treatment group, patients had a mean olfactory score of 10 (IQR 15) at initial control. At the 20-day control, a significant im-provement in the olfactory scores, compared to the baseline, was detected [70 (IQR 40) versus 10 (IQR 15)]. Olfactory function further improved at 40 days [median score 90 (IQR 50)]. Patients in the treatment group reported significantly higher improvements of the olfactory scores than the controls at both the 20-day [40 (IQR 45) versus 10 (IQR 15)] and 40-day [60 (IQR 40) versus 30 (IQR 25)] evaluations. CONCLUSIONS Based on the results of this study, the mix of drugs including steroids could represent a useful specific therapy to reduce the prevalence of this long-term morbidity.","Vaira, L A; Hopkins, C; Petrocelli, M; Lechien, J R; Cutrupi, S; Salzano, G; Chiesa-Estomba, C M; Saussez, S; De Riu, G",Rhinology,576,33

Objective To determine whether the novel 3-dimensional (3-D) stent retriever used in conjunction with an aspiration-based mechanical thrombectomy device (Penumbra System; Penumbra) is noninferior to aspiration-based thrombectomy alone in AIS. Design, Setting, and Participants This randomized, noninferiority clinical trial enrolled patients at 25 North American centers from May 19, 2012, through November 19, 2015, with follow-up for 90 days. Adjudicators of the primary end points were masked to treatment allocation. Patients with large-vessel intracranial occlusion AIS presenting with a National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score of at least 8 within 8 hours of onset underwent 1:1 randomization to 3-D stent retriever with aspiration or aspiration alone. The primary analyses were conducted in the intention-to-treat population. Interventions Mechanical thrombectomy using intracranial aspiration with or without the 3-D stent retriever. Main Outcomes and Measures The primary effectiveness end point was the rate of a modified Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction (mTICI) grade of 2 to 3 with a 15% noninferiority margin. Device- and procedure-related serious adverse events at 24 hours were the primary safety end points. Results Of 8082 patients screened, 198 patients were enrolled (111 women [56.1%] and 87 men [43.9%]; mean [SD] age, 66.9 [13.0] years) and randomized, including 98 in the 3-D stent retriever with aspiration group and 100 in the aspiration alone group; an additional 238 patients were eligible but not enrolled. The median baseline NIHSS score was 18.0 (interquartile range, 14.0-23.0). Eighty-two of 94 patients in the 3-D stent retriever and aspiration group (87.2%) had an mTICI grade of 2 to 3 compared with 79 of 96 in the aspiration alone group (82.3%; difference, 4.9%; 90% CI, -3.6% to 13.5%). None of the other measures were significantly different between the 2 groups. Device-related serious adverse events were reported by 4 of 98 patients in the 3-D stent retriever with aspiration group (4.1%) vs 5 of 100 patients in the aspiration only group (5.0%); procedure-related serious adverse events, 10 of 98 (10.2%) vs 14 of 100 (14.0%). A 90-day modified Rankin Scale score of 0 to 2 was reported by 39 of 86 patients in the 3-D stent retriever with aspiration group (45.3%) vs 44 of 96 patients in the aspiration only group (45.8%). Conclusions and Relevance The present study provides class 1 evidence for the noninferiority of the 3-D stent retriever with aspiration vs aspiration alone in AIS. Future trials should evaluate whether these results can be generalized to other stent retrievers.

This study had the aim of exploring the potential of developing and validating a model for prediction of future CGM measurements in order to overcome the time-delay. METHODS An artificial neural network regression (NN) approach were used to predict CGM values with a lead-time of 15 min. The NN were trained and internally validated on 23 million minutes of CGM and externally validated on 2 million minutes of CGM. The validation included data from 278 type 1 diabetes patients using three different CGM sensors. The NN performance were compared with three alternative methods, linear extrapolation, spline extrapolation and last observation carried forward. RESULTS The internal validation yielded a RMSE of 9.1 mg/dL, a MARD of 4.2 % and 99.9 % of predictions were in the A + B zone of the consensus error grid. The external validation yielded a RMSE of 5.9-11.3 mg/dL, a MARD of 3.2-5.4 % and 99.9-100 % of predictions were in the A + B zone of the consensus error grid. The NN performed better on all parameters compared to the two alternative methods. CONCLUSIONS We proposed and validated a NN glucose prediction model that is potential simple to use and implement. The model only needs input from a CGM system in order to facilitate glucose prediction with a lead time of 15 min. The approach yielded good results for both internal and external validation.","Cichosz, Simon Lebech; Jensen, Morten Hasselstrøm; Hejlesen, Ole",International journal of medical informatics,576,31
78403,78403,78403,First US MERS-CoV cases underscore need for preparedness.,11.186541,11.631482,2014,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE Intravenous thrombolysis (IVT) within 4.5 hours from symptom onset improves functional outcome in patients with acute ischemic stroke. Its use in patients with previous stroke within the preceding 3 months is contraindicated because of the assumed higher risk of intracranial hemorrhage. In addition, tissue-type plasminogen activator may itself promote neurotoxicity and blood-brain barrier disruption. However, safety and effectiveness of repeated IVT is essentially unknown in patients with early (<3 months) recurrent stroke (ERS), because they were excluded from thrombolysis trials. This article reports the largest case series of repeated IVT in ERS. METHODS We reviewed databases of prospectively collected patient data of 8 European stroke centers for the presence of patients with ERS, who received IVT for both the index stroke and ERS. Demographics, clinical and radiological data, bleeding complications, and functional outcome were analyzed. RESULTS We identified 19 subjects with repeated IVT in ERS. Mean age was 68±12 years, and 37% of them were female. Median interthrombolysis interval was 30 days (interquartile range, 13-50). Functional independence (modified Rankin scale score ≤2) was achieved in 79% of patients after the first and in 47.4% after repeated IV tissue-type plasminogen activator, respectively. There was no symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage. Median final infarct volume after the first IVT was 1.5 cm(3) (interquartile range, 0.5-3.1). CONCLUSIONS Patients with small infarct volumes and robust clinical improvement might be considered for repeated IVT within 3 months. Studies following strict protocols and larger registries incorporating these patients might serve to identify selection criteria for the safe use of repeated IVT in ERS.","Kahles, Timo; Mono, Marie-Luise; Heldner, Mirjam Rachel; Baumgartner, Ralf Werner; Sarikaya, Hakan; Luft, Andreas; Bohlhalter, Stephan; Traenka, Christopher; Engelter, Stefan T; Kurka, Natalia; Köhrmann, Martin; Curtze, Sami; Michel, Patrik; Tatlisumak, Turgut; Nedeltchev, Krassen",Stroke,576,29

Here we report a full-length crystal structure of the classical swine fever virus (CSFV) NS3 in complex with its NS4A protease cofactor segment (PCS) at a 2.35-Å resolution. The structure reveals a previously unidentified ∼2,200-Å2 intramolecular protease-helicase interface comprising three clusters of interactions, representing a ""closed"" global conformation related to the NS3-NS4A cis-cleavage event. Although this conformation is incompatible with protease trans-cleavage, it appears to be functionally important and beneficial to the helicase activity, as the mutations designed to perturb this conformation impaired both the helicase activities in vitro and virus production in vivo Our work reveals important features of protease-helicase coordination in pestivirus NS3 and provides a key basis for how different conformational states may explicitly contribute to certain functions of this natural protease-helicase fusion protein.IMPORTANCE Many RNA viruses encode helicases to aid their RNA genome replication and transcription by unwinding structured RNA. Being naturally fused to a protease participating in viral polyprotein processing, the NS3 helicases encoded by the Flaviviridae family viruses are unique. Therefore, how these two enzyme modules coordinate in a single polypeptide is of particular interest. Here we report a previously unidentified conformation of pestivirus NS3 in complex with its NS4A protease cofactor segment (PCS). This conformational state is related to the protease cis-cleavage event and is optimal for the function of helicase. This work provides an important basis to understand how different enzymatic activities of NS3 may be achieved by the coordination between the protease and helicase through different conformational states.","Zheng, Fengwei; Lu, Guoliang; Li, Ling; Gong, Peng; Pan, Zishu",Journal of virology,576,7

Leading this push are direct-acting antivirals (DAAs), currently comprising inhibitors that target the HCV protease NS3, the viral polymerase NS5B, and the non-structural protein NS5A. In combination with one another, along with the traditional standard-of-care ribavirin and PEGylated-IFNα, these compounds have proven to afford tremendous efficacy to treatment-naíve patients, as well as to prior non-responders. Nevertheless, by targeting viral components, the possibility of selecting for breakthrough and treatment-resistant virus strains remains a concern. Host-targeting antivirals are a distinct class of anti-HCV compounds that is emerging as a complementary set of tools to combat the disease. Cyclophilin (Cyp) inhibitors are one such group in this category. In contrast to DAAs, Cyp inhibitors target a host protein, CypA, and have also demonstrated remarkable antiviral efficiency in clinical trials, without the generation of viral escape mutants. This review serves to summarize the current literature on Cyps and their relation to the HCV viral life cycle, as well as other viruses.","Baugh, James; Gallay, Philippe",Biological chemistry,576,1

However, seromas often form postoperatively at the donor site as a complication. This study aimed to determine the impact of different electrocautery modes during flap elevation, with or without subsequent quilting sutures, on postoperative seroma formation. METHODS Subjects were 112 patients who underwent immediate breast reconstruction with LD flaps after breast-conserving surgery between April 2015 and January 2019. Group A consisted of 21 patients who underwent LD flap elevation using the fulgurate mode, and group B consisted of 25 patients who underwent flap elevation using the lower power, pure cut mode. Group C consisted of 66 patients who underwent flap elevation with the lower power, pure cut mode combined with quilting sutures for wound closure. RESULTS Mean 1-week postoperative back drain volume and the mean number of days to drain removal in group B were significantly reduced relative to those in group A (group A, 752.3 mL and 16.9 days, respectively; group B, 552.2 mL and 10.6 days, respectively; P < 0.001 for both). Group C, which included quilting sutures, had even lower values than group B (459.7 mL and 7.4 days, respectively; group B vs group C: P = 0.03 and P < 0.001, respectively). Significant differences were observed between groups for postoperative seroma formation at the flap donor site (group A, 16 [76.2%] of 21 patients; group B, 11 [44%] 25 patients; group C, 4 [6.1%] of 66 patients; A vs B: P < 0.001, B vs C: P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS The use of low power, pure cut mode for LD flap harvest, combined with quilting sutures, effectively shortened the time to drain removal and suppressed seroma formation. Given that specialized devices and materials are not required, this combination may reduce both patient burden and medical costs.","Tashima, Hiroki; Tomita, Koichi; Kurita, Tomoyuki; Kubo, Tateki",Annals of plastic surgery,576,1

The impact of these changes on HCWs and patients was assessed 3 months later. RESULTS Developing separate areas helped to minimize the risk of exposure of patients and HCWs to those with COVID-19. Residents and consultants worked intensively in clinical areas for 1 week followed by 1-2 weeks of non-clinical or standby assignments, providing adequate opportunity for isolation. Frequent re-evaluation of the roster was nevertheless required as the pandemic progressed.

However, ensuring that emergency medical technicians (EMTs) maintain their clinical knowledge and proficiency with procedural skills is challenging, as continuing education requirements are still being introduced, and clinical instructional efforts need strengthening. We describe the development and implementation of an innovative asynchronous learning tool for EMTs in the form of a Web-based trivia game. Methods Over 500 case-based multiple-choice questions (covering 10 essential prehospital content areas) were created by experts in prehospital education, piloted with EMT educators from LMICs, and delivered to EMTs through a Web-based quiz game platform over a 12-week period. We enrolled 252 participants from nine countries. Results Thirty-two participants (12.7%) completed the entire 12-week game. Participants who completed the game were administered a survey with a 100% response rate. Ninety-three percent of participants used their mobile phone to access the game. Overall, participants reported that the interface was easy to use (93.8% agreed or strongly agreed), the game improved their knowledge (100% agreed or strongly agreed), and they felt better prepared for their jobs (100% agreed or strongly agreed). The primary motivators for participation were improving patient care (37.5%) and being recognized on the game's leaderboard (31.3%). All participants reported that they would engage in the game again (43.8% agreed and 56.3% strongly agreed) and would recommend the game to their colleagues (34.4% agreed and 65.6% strongly agreed). Conclusions In conclusion, a quiz game targeting EMT learners from LMICs was viewed as accessible and effective by participants.

Design Descriptive study. Setting University hospital. Patients Those with ovarian cyst and uterine myoma. Intervention A platform is placed in the 2-3 cm Higuchi incision just above the pubis or on the pubis. Blunt dissection of the subcutaneous adipose tissue is performed. A T incision of the rectus abdominis fascia and a longitudinal incision of the peritoneum are performed. A LAP PROTECTOR and EZ access (Hakko Medical, Nagano, Japan) are used with the platform for single-incision laparoscopic surgery. The peritoneum and fascia are closed by continuous suture, and the skin is closed using the dermostitch technique. Main Results Higuchi's transverse incision is 2-3 cm in length and is made at a much lower position than the conventional Pfannenstiel transverse incision. The wound is covered by pubic hair, yielding an excellent esthetic outcome. The T incision of the rectus abdominis fascia secures a more extensive surgical field than the Pfannenstiel transverse incision. Conclusion Higuchi's modified transverse incision ensures a sufficient visual field, yields an excellent esthetic outcome, and is safe, suggesting the potential use of this method for RPS.","Okamoto, Aikou; Nagayoshi, Yoko; Kawabata, Ayako; Sakamoto, Masaru; Ueda, Kazu",Gynecology and minimally invasive therapy,576,26

However, the mechanism involved in PM2.5 induced lung cancer is still largely unknown. In this study, we performed chronic PM2.5 stimulation animal and cells model to investigate the carcinogenetic mechanisms of PM2.5 by targeting EMT through Notch1 signal pathway. Next, we focused on the miRNA involved in PM2.5 induced Notch1 pathway activation. We found chronic PM2.5 could induce EMT event in vivo and in vitro, while reducing miR-139-5p expression and activating Notch1 pathway meanwhile. And blocking Notch1 signal pathway by specific small molecule inhibitor could reverse PM2.5 induced EMT. Then, overexpression of miR-139-5p downregulated the expression of Notch1 protein in untreated 16HBE cells. Importantly, overexpression of miR-139-5p blocked Notch1 pathway activation and inhibited EMT event in PM2.5 treated cells. These results indicate that PM2.5 induces EMT event through Notch1 signal pathway and miR-139-5p is a novel regulator of PM2.5-induced EMT by targeting Notch1. Our conclusion is that overexpression of miR-139-5p can down-regulate the expression of Notch1 and reverse the occurrence of malignant lung events induced by chronic exposure to PM2.5.","Wang, Yunxia; Zhong, Yijue; Zhang, Cheng; Liao, Jiping; Wang, Guangfa",Journal of Cancer,576,17

Using indoor growth chambers, air humidity is reported to influence spring phenology in temperate trees. However, previous studies have not investigated the effect of air humidity on the spring phenology using long-term and large-scale ground observations. Therefore, the role of humidity in spring phenology in temperate trees still remains poorly understood. Here, we synthesized 229,588 records of leaf unfolding dates in eight temperate tree species, including four early-successional and four late-successional species, at 1716 observation sites during 1951-2015 in Europe, and comprehensively analyzed the effect of humidity on the spring phenology. We found that rising humidity significantly delayed spring leaf unfolding for all eight temperate tree species. Leaf unfolding was more sensitive to humidity in early-successional species compared to late-successional species. In addition, the delaying effect of humidity on leaf unfolding increased as temperature warmed over the past 65 years. Our results provide evidence that spring leaf unfolding of temperate trees was significantly delayed by rising humidity. The delaying effect of humidity may restrict earlier spring phenology induced by warming, especially for early-successional species, under future climate warming scenarios in temperate forests.","He, Xujian; Chen, Shanshan; Wang, Jinmei; Smith, Nicholas G; Rossi, Sergio; Yang, Hongjun; Liu, Jianquan; Chen, Lei",The Science of the total environment,576,16

Especially for pathogens, such as disease-causing bacteria and viruses, insights gained by cryo-EM can aid in developing cures. However, due to the biosafety restrictions of human pathogens, samples are often treated by chemical fixation to render the pathogen inert, affecting the delicate ultrastructure of the sample. Alternatively, researchers use in vitro or ex vivo models, which are non-pathogenic but lack the complexity of the pathogen of interest. Here we show that ultraviolet-C (UVC) radiation at cryogenic temperatures can be used to eliminate or dramatically reduce the infectivity of two model organisms, a pathogenic bacterium (Vibrio cholerae) and a virus-like particle (the ICP1 bacteriophage). We show no discernable structural impact of this treatment of either sample using two cryo-EM methods: cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET) followed by sub-tomogram averaging (STA), and single particle analysis (SPA). Additionally, we applied the UVC irradiation to the protein apoferritin (ApoF), which is a widely used test sample for high resolution SPA studies. The UVC-treated ApoF sample resulted in a 2.1 Å structure that did not reveal any discernable structural damage. Together, these results show that the UVC irradiation dose that effectively inactivates cryo-EM samples does not negatively impact their structure. This research demonstrates that UVC treatment is an effective and inexpensive addition to the cryo-EM sample preparation toolbox.","Depelteau, JS; Renault, L; Althof, N; Cassidy, CK; Mendonça, LM; Jensen, GJ; Resch, GP; Briegel, A",bioRxiv,576,4

Yet, knowledge of the specific immune cell subsets targeted by IL-1β and IL-1β-induced signaling pathways in humans is limited. Utilizing mass cytometry (CyTOF) of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells, we identified effector memory CD4 T cells and CD4−CD8low/-CD161+ T cells as the circulating immune subtypes with the greatest expression of p-NF-κB in response to IL-1β stimulation. Notably, CCR6 distinctly identified T cells most responsive to IL-1β. Other subsets including CD11c myeloid dendritic cells (mDCs), classical monocytes (CM), two subsets of natural killer cells (CD16−CD56brightCD161− and CD16−CD56dimCD161+) and a population of lineage−(Lin-) cells expressing CD161 and CD25 also showed IL-1β-induced expression of p-NF-kB. The IL-1R antagonist, Anakinra significantly inhibited IL-1β-induced p-NF-kB in the CCR6+ T cells and CD11c mDCs with a trending inhibition in CD14 monocytes and Lin−CD161+CD25+ cells. IL-1β also induced a rapid but much less robust increase in p-p38 expression as compared to p-NF-kB in the majority of these same immune cell subsets. Prolonged IL-1β stimulation greatly increased p-STAT3 and to a much lesser extent p-STAT1 and p-STAT5 in T cell subsets, monocytes, DCs and the Lin−CD161+CD25+ cells suggesting IL-1β-induced production of downstream STAT-activating cytokines, consistent with its role in cytokine storm. Interindividual heterogeneity and inhibition of this activation by Anakinra raises the intriguing possibility that assays to measure IL-1β-induced p-NF-kB in CCR6+ T cell subtypes could identify those at higher risk of cytokine storm and those most likely to benefit from Anakinra therapy.","Kothari, Hema; Williams, Corey M.; McSkimming, Chantel; Vigneshwar, Mythili; Zunder, Eli R.; McNamara, Coleen A.",bioRxiv,576,1

A HSR is proposed in this paper as a useful tool to conceptualize major changes in social thinking, at the interface of individual and collective dynamics. A HSR is defined as the crystallization of a meaning-complex on what is valuable and vital for a community, generating competing for social identities, practices, and social policies. The paper revisits the concept initiated by Moscovici and focuses on the role of competing groups, generating opposing perspectives. We argue that at this crucial point, close attention to the way in which meaning is negotiated across a series of key elements of the HSR of survival will help better informing communication and action concerning climate change. © 2021 Hogrefe Publishing.","Magioglou, T.; Coen, S.",European Psychologist,576,20

Assessment of chronic consequences of TBI must distinguish between effects of age and injury. Methods C57BL/6 mice receive single closed head injury (CHI) and are analyzed at 14DPI or 180DPI for cortical atrophy and 7DPI or 180DPI for behavioral outcomes. Results CHI induces ipsilesional atrophy at 14DPI that increases 180 DPI due to an effect of age. On open field, injured mice develop a turn bias at 180DPI not present at 7DPI. On rotarod, injured mice have shorter latencies at 7DPI, but not at 180DPI due to worsening performance of aging uninjured mice. On beam walk, both groups at 180DPI more slowly traverse a 2cm and 1cm beam than at 7DPI. Foot-faults show no significant effects of age or injury. Limb position was assessed using Deeplabcut™ markerless tracking followed by computation of absition (integral of limb displacement over time) using custom Python scripts. On the 2cm beam, age increased absition in all limbs of uninjured mice and both forelimbs of injured mice. Injury increased left hindlimb absition at 7DPI. On the 1cm beam both forelimbs and the left hindlimb of injured mice at 180DPI have larger absition than uninjured mice at 180DPI or injured mice at 7DPI. These data suggest chronic and progressive motor deficits of injured mice at 180DPI. Conclusions A single impact produces ipsilesional cortical atrophy and chronic and progressive motor deficits.

METHODS A retrospective study was conducted of all patients who were treated surgically for hip fracture in a tertiary center during the COVID-19 lockdown period between 01 March and 01 June 2020 and the equivalent period in 2019. Demographic characteristics, time to surgery, surgery type, hospitalization time, discharge destination, postoperative complications, and 30- and 90-day mortality rates were collected for all patients. RESULTS During the COVID-19 period, 105 patients were operated due to hip fractures compared to 136 in the equivalent period with no statistical difference in demographics. The rate of surgeries within 48 hours of admission was significantly higher in the COVID-19 period (92% vs. 76%, respectively; P = 0.0006).

Two types of containment strategies are compared: (1) a constant containment strategy that could satisfy the needs of citizens for a long period; and (2) an adaptive containment strategy whose strict level changes across time. We consider how an effective treatment of the disease can affect the dynamics in a pandemic scenario. For illustration we consider a region with population 2.8 million and 200 initial infectious cases assuming a 4% mortality rate compared with a 2% mortality rate if a new drug is available. Our results show compared with a constant containment strategy, adaptive containment strategies shorten the outbreak length and reduce maximum daily number of cases.

The pooled odd ratio (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (95%CI) was calculated using the Z test to assess the association between headache and the presence of COVID-19 cases. Results: We included 104,751 COVID-19 cases from 78 eligible studies to calculate the global prevalence of headache in COVID-19 and 17 studies were included to calculate the association of headache and COVID-19. The cumulative prevalence of headache in COVID-19 was 25.2% (26,464 out of 104,751 cases). Headache was found to be more prevalent, approximately by two-fold, in COVID-19 patients than in non-COVID-19 patients (other respiratory viral infections), OR: 1.73;95% CI: 1.94, 2.5 with p=0.04. Conclusion: Headache is common among COVID-19 patients and seems to be more common in COVID-19 patients compared to those with the non-COVID-19 viral infection. No definitive mechanisms on how headache emerges in COVID-19 patients but several possible hypotheses have been proposed. However, extensive studies are warranted to elucidate the mechanisms.

Currently, infection with SARS-CoV-2 has been the cause of death of over 2.5 million people globally, and there is still no effective curative treatment. Clinically, the severe symptoms caused by COVID-19, in addition to pneumonia, are associated with the development of hyperinflammatory syndrome and thrombosis. It is urgent to expand our understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved in the pathophysiology of COVID-19. This article discusses the potential role that the chemokine CX3CL1 could have in the development of COVID-19-associated thrombosis. CX3CL1 is abundantly expressed by activated endothelium and is an important regulator of many aspects of endothelial function and dysfunction, including thrombosis. The generation of hypotheses about molecules that could be relevant in well-defined aspects of the pathophysiology of COVID-19 encourages the development of basic and clinical studies, that could help find effective and much needed treatments.","Rivas-Fuentes, Selma; Valdés, Víctor Julián; Espinosa, Blanca; Gorocica-Rosete, Patricia; Salgado-Aguayo, Alfonso",Med Hypotheses,576,20

The model divides the total population into two groups, depending on whether they have underlying conditions, and describes the disease transmission both within and between the groups. As an application of this model, we perform a case study for Hamilton County, the fourth-most populous county in the US state of Tennessee and a region with high prevalence of chronic conditions. Our data fitting and simulation results quantify the high risk of COVID-19 for the population group with underlying health conditions. The findings suggest that weakening the disease transmission route between the exposed and susceptible individuals, including the reduction of the between-group contact, would be an effective approach to protect the most vulnerable people in this population group.","Yang, Chayu; Wang, Jin",Math Biosci Eng,576,24

Conventional expansion methods are expected to have some shortcomings;the Unilateral dental expander appliance used to restore unilateral cross bite dental arch is an uncommon appliance;for this, a designed new device is needed. This paper aimed to invite a new unilateral dental expander appliance (UDEX) to treat unilateral dental posterior crossbite in adults using available dental material, easy to use and handle, well tolerated by the patient, and biocompatible with oral structure. It could find that in all dental markets and dental clinics-an eighteen-year-old female with bilateral crossbite and upper and lower dental arch crowding. During active orthodontic treatment, a quad-helix expander had broken from one side at soldering between band and wire attachment. The patient did not show up to the clinic for a while due to COVID 19 pandemic lockdown, leading to a true unilateral crossbite at the dental arch's upper left side, especially at the molar premolars area. This unilateral cross bite was treated using a new specially designed expanded appliance as a unilateral posterior cross bite dental maxillary expander. As a result of this study, orthodontic treatment was finished within (15) months, much less than expected. We obtained Class I molar and canine relationships with uncrossed dental arches in both upper arch sides, proper overbite and overjet with well-leveled and aligned teeth as it confirmed by clinical examination and radiographic images (OPG (Orthopantomogram) and cephalometric radiograph (WebCeph analysis digitalized computer program). Conclude from that, the newly designed unilateral dental expander (UDEX) is proven to be useful for treating real unilateral posterior crossbites as single molar or premolar tooth andmultiple joint unilateral crossed posterior teeth. Also, it could easily modify it for future unilateral crossed purposes. This appliance was fabricated using readily available dental material, well tolerated by patients, and reduced the need for excessive patient compliance. An orthodontist could fabricate devices, or cautious laboratory work is required;it can rapidly achieve favorable results. © 2021 Tech Science Press. All rights reserved.","Hasan, H. S.; Abdallah, A.

DESIGN: Eligible cohort or case-control studies were identified systematically using comprehensive search terms and a validated search filter for prognostic studies. Medline (OVID), EMBASE (OVID), CINAHL (EMBSCO), and PsycINFO (OVID) databases were searched. Risk of bias, using Quality in Prognosis Studies tool, and quality of evidence, using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation, were assessed. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: People aged 65 years and older from any clinical setting. MEASURES: Any ACB measures were accepted (including the anticholinergic domain of the Drug Burden Index). Any global/multidimensional measure for physical function and/or quality of life was accepted for outcome. RESULTS: Thirteen studies reporting associations between ACB and physical function (n = 10) or quality of life (n = 4) were included. Exposure measures included Anticholinergic Cognitive Burden Scale, Anticholinergic Drug Scale, Anticholinergic Risk Scale, Clinician Rated Anticholinergic Score, and the anticholinergic domain of the Drug Burden Index. All studies were rated moderate risk of bias in &#8805;2 Quality in Prognosis Studies categories with 5 rated high risk in &#8805;1 categories. Seven of 10 studies (5251 of 7569 participants) reported significant decline in physical function with increased burden. All 4 studies (2635 participants) reporting quality of life demonstrated similar association with increased burden. High risk of biases and inadequate data reporting restricted analysis. There was no evidence to support one measure being superior to another. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: The evidence supports association between increased ACB and future impairments in physical function and quality of life. No conclusion can be made regarding which ACB measure has the best prognostic value. Well-designed longitudinal studies are required to address this. Clinicians should be aware of patient's anticholinergic burden and consider alternative medications where appropriate.","Stewart, Carrie; Yrjana, Kaisa; Kishor, Mitrysha; Soiza, Roy L; Taylor-Rowan, Martin; Quinn, Terence J; Loke, Yoon K; Myint, Phyo Kyaw",J.

The aim of this study was to assess whether telemedicine (using iPads) reduced PPE use in emergency department (ED) patients who were treated in contact isolation, and whether telemedicine had a positive effect on patient anxiety and satisfaction. METHODS: We conducted a prospective single centre before-and-after study including ED patients &#8805;18 years who were treated in contact isolation. PPE use, the Hospital Anxiety Scale and the 15-item Picker Patient Experience Questionnaire were compared between the control period (8 April to 14 April 2020) and intervention period (15 April to 24 April 2020). RESULTS: We included 25 patients in each period. PPE use per patient was higher for physicians in the control period (mean 1.7; 95% CI 1.5 to 1.9) compared with the intervention period (mean 1.2; 95% CI 1.0 to 1.3, p<0.01). Total PPE use per patient contact for ED physicians decreased from 42 out of 42 patient contacts in the control period, to 29 out of 66 patient contacts in the intervention period (difference 54.3%; 95% CI 50.1% to 58.6%, p<0.01). Reported anxiety and satisfaction were not significantly different. CONCLUSION: PPE use by physicians can successfully be reduced by using telemedicine in the ED without increasing anxiety or dissatisfaction. This study was a first step to gain experience with telemedicine in the ED which has the potential to reduce PPE use in future pandemics or other patients with an indication for contact isolation.","Candel, Bart G J; Vaes, Selma M M; van Bree, Egid M; Groenen, Sophie M A; Derkx, Floor; Mignot, Lisette A A; de Groot, Bas",Emerg Med J,576,20

The median of quality of documents assessed with the AGREE II-GRS tool was 2.0 (interquartile range 1.5-2.5). Most documents did not fulfill the rigour of guideline development quality criteria. The AGREE II-GRS scores did not differ significantly across the type of the document, issuing institution and the mode of publication. 75% of documents provided recommendations for the use of antiviral medications despite apparent lack of sufficient evidence supporting such treatments. Of the included documents, 75% were not updated within the 2 months after the publication of the first randomized controlled trial on COVID-19 antiviral therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Most guidelines or guidance documents published during the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic were of poor quality, contained recommendations for the use of antiviral therapy for SARS-CoV-2 infection despite only very low quality of evidence available, and were not updated on a regular basis.","Mejza, Filip; Lesniak, Wiktoria; Jaeschke, Roman",Pol Arch Intern Med,576,20

These macroorganisms are exposed to and infected by a tremendous diversity of microorganisms. Those that are large enough can even be infected by multicellular fungi and parasites. Each interaction is unique, if only because it operates between two unique living organisms, in an infinite diversity of circumstances. This is neatly illustrated by the extraordinarily high level of interindividual clinical variability in human infections, even for a given pathogen, ranging from a total absence of clinical manifestations to death. We discuss here the idea that the determinism of human life-threatening infectious diseases can be governed by single-gene inborn errors of immunity, which are rarely Mendelian and frequently display incomplete penetrance. We briefly review the evidence in support of this notion obtained over the last two decades, referring to a number of focused and thorough reviews published by eminent colleagues in this issue of Human Genetics. It seems that almost any life-threatening infectious disease can be driven by at least one, and, perhaps, a great many diverse monogenic inborn errors, which may nonetheless be immunologically related. While the proportions of monogenic cases remain unknown, a picture in which genetic heterogeneity is combined with physiological homogeneity is emerging from these studies. A preliminary sketch of the human genetic architecture of severe infectious diseases is perhaps in sight.","Casanova, Jean-Laurent; Abel, Laurent",Hum Genet,576,20

The objective of this study was to study the composition and characteristics of the soil microbial communities that had been exposed to long-term selection pressure caused by the industrial production of penicillin G. Soil samples from four sites among the penicillin G production plant were analysed using 16S rRNA profiling via Illumina MiSeq platform and were compared with the control samples from four sites outside the plant. Total metagenomic DNA from the impacted soil was also used for the preparation of E. coli T1R-based fosmid library which was consequently qualitatively tested for the presence of penicillin G acylase (PGA)-encoding genes using the method of sequence homology. Analyses of alpha diversity revealed that the long-term antibiotic presence in the soil significantly increased the microbial diversity and richness in terms of Shannon diversity index (p = 0.002) and Chao estimates (p = 0.004). Principal component analysis showed that the two types of communities (on-site and control) could be separated at the phylum, class and genus level. The on-site soil was enriched in Betaproteobacteria, Deltaproteobacteria, Gemmatimonadetes, Acidobacteria and Planctomycetia, while a significant decrease in Actinobacteria was observed. Metagenomic fosmid library revealed high hit rates in identifying PGAs (14 different genes identified) and confirmed the biotechnological potential of soils impacted by anthropogenic activity. This study offers new insights into the changes in microbial communities of soils exposed to anthropogenic activity as well as indicates that those soils may represent a hotspot for biotechnologically interesting targets.","Borcinová, Martina; Pitkina, Anastasiya; Maresová, Helena; Stepánek, Václav; Palyzová, Andrea; Kyslík, Pavel",,576,20

Activation of inflammatory signaling pathways and cytokine storm are crucial factors that lead to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in COVID-19 patients. Excessive secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines leads to the dysregulation of the innate immune system. The cytokine storm attracts many inflammatory cells that infiltrate into the lung tissues and ultimately cause immune damage. In addition to the dysregulation of the immune system, dysfunction of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) due to the downregulation of ACE2 is also associated with the mortality of COVID-19 patients. Both the mechanisms are directly or indirectly associated with cytokine storm that promotes vascular hyperpermeability, vascular edema leading to hypercoagulation and hence multiorgan damage. As of now, there is no specific treatment available for COVID-19, but scientists have purposed several treatment options including cytokine inhibitors, JAK inhibitors, immunomodulators, plasma therapy, etc. In this article, we provide the detailed mechanism of occurrence of SARS-CoV-2 induced inflammatory storm and its connection with the pre-existing inflammatory conditions.

In the second phase, several safety procedures were implemented to avoid school closure. To evaluate if the school is a safe place, students and staff of two school complexes of Rome were monitored to evaluate the efficacy of prevention measures inside the school buildings. METHODS: Oral secretions specimens were collected from 1262 subjects for a total of 3431 samples, collected over a 3 months period. Detection of Coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 was performed by real-time PCR. Target genes were represented by E gene, RdRP/S gene and N gene. RESULTS: Among the 3431 samples analyzed, just 16 sample resulted as positive or low positive: 1 sample in the first month, 12 samples in the second month and 3 in the third month. In each period of evaluation, all positive children attended different classes. CONCLUSIONS: Even if the school has the potential for spreading viruses, our preliminary results show the efficacy of the implementations undertaken in this setting to minimize virus diffusion.

From December 2019 to present, millions of cases have been reported, bringing unprecedented pressure on both health and epidemic prevention services in every country. As frontline healthcare workers, ophthalmologists face an increased threat of viral infection, not only because of close contact with patients during examinations or operations, but also due to evidence showing that ocular fluids such as tears or conjunctival secretions may carry the virus. The risk that healthcare workers face is emphasized by the loss of our colleagues who have sacrificed themselves in combating the virus. As a result, it is necessary to have a comprehensive understanding of the threats that we face. In the first part of this review, we start by explaining the structure of SARS-CoV-2 and examining its transmission and means of infection. Next, we summarize the latest scientific advancements of epidemiology, clinical presentations, and current treatments of COVID-19. In the second half of the review, we emphasize the ocular transmission, symptomatic manifestations, and the essential knowledge in an ophthalmology clinic setting. As the pandemic of COVID-19 continues to pose a threat to global health, we hope that this review makes a contribution to combating COVID-19.","Sun, Shuo; Su, Wenqi; Lin, Christopher Q; Li, Xiaorong; Yan, Hua; Tian, Bo; Lin, Haijiang",Discov Med,576,16

IL-6 is produced by immune cells and is instrumental in the up-regulation of acute phase reactants and helper T cell differentiation needed for B lymphocyte and antibody production. Inhibitors of IL-6 may result in down-regulation of immunoglobulin formation, predisposing patients to superinfections. Tocilizumab is a recombinant monoclonal antibody that targets the IL-6 receptor and is used in the management of rheumatologic diseases. More recently, tocilizumab has been used to treat patients with COVID-19. Based on results of retrospective cohort studies, tocilizumab may shorten time to clinical improvement and duration of invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV);however, the relationship between tocilizumab and development of secondary infections is uncertain due to limited and conflicting data. Our study aims to evaluate the use of tocilizumab in critically ill patients with COVID-19 who develop bacterial superinfections with or without bronchopleural fistulas (BPF). MethodsWe conducted a retrospective observational case series utilizing data from 50 patients admitted to the intensive care units at Lankenau Medical Center and Paoli Hospital, two large academic suburban hospitals. All patients were diagnosed with confirmed COVID-19 between February and July 2020 and received tocilizumab. ResultsTwenty-three (46%) patients who received tocilizumab developed secondary bacterial infections. Isolated organisms are outlined in Figure 1. The most common pathogens were MSSA and MRSA. Two of these patients developed a BPF. Of the 50 patients, 90% required invasive mechanical ventilation and 10% required non-invasive ventilation. Nine patients underwent extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. Illness severity ranged from mild to severe ARDS. ConclusionDespite its theoretical benefits, exposure to tocilizumab may predispose certain individuals to secondary infections, which may induce structural damage and cellular death. In our study, 46% of patients developed confirmed bacterial infection after receiving tocilizumab. Two of these patients went on to develop a BPF. The results of our study are in contrast to the results recently published in the NEJM, which reported that 8.1% of patients developed serious infection after receiving tocilizumab. The increased rate of bacterial superinfections noted in our study population may be in part due to illness severity, as all of our patients were critically ill and most of them required IMV. Additional randomized controlled trials of critically ill patients with COVID-19 are needed to determine if treatment with tocilizumab is directly correlated with the development of secondary bacterial infections.","Kumar, T.; Hart, S.; Sutter, J.

Caring for patients during an epidemic/pandemic may impact negatively on the mental health of HCPs. There is a lack of evidence-based advice on what would be effective in mitigating this impact. OBJECTIVES: This rapid review synthesizes the evidence on the psychological impact of pandemics/epidemics on the mental health of HCPs, what factors predict this impact, and the evidence of prevention/intervention strategies to reduce this impact. METHOD: According to rapid review guidelines, systematic searches were carried out in Embase.com , PubMed, APA PsycINFO-Ovid SP, and Web of Science (core collection). Searches were restricted to the years 2003 or later to ensure inclusion of the most recent epidemic/pandemics, such as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). Papers written in French or English, published in peer-reviewed journals, and of quantitative design using validated measures of mental health outcomes were included. Of 1308 papers found, 50 were included. The full protocol for this rapid review was registered with Prospero (reg.no. CRD42020175985). RESULTS: Results show that exposed HCPs working with patients during an epidemic/pandemic are at heightened risk of mental health problems in the short and longer term, particularly: psychological distress, insomnia, alcohol/drug misuse, and symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, anxiety, burnout, anger, and higher perceived stress. These mental health problems are predicted by organizational, social, personal, and psychological factors and may interfere with the quality of patient care. Few evidence-based early interventions exist so far. DISCUSSION: HCPs need to be provided with psychosocial support to protect their mental wellbeing if they are to continue to provide high quality patient care. Several recommendations relevant during and after an epidemic/pandemic, such as COVID-19, and in preparation for a future outbreak, are proposed.","Stuijfzand, Suzannah; Deforges, Camille; Sandoz, Vania; Sajin, Consuela-Thais; Jaques, Cecile; Elmers, Jolanda; Horsch, Antje",BMC Public Health,576,10

METHODS: Using a web-based cross-sectional survey we collected data from 2200 self-selected, assessed volunteers and their children. Demographic information, knowledge and beliefs about COVID-19, generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) using the (GAD-7) scale, emotional problems in children using the strengths and difficulties questionnaire (SDQ), worry and fear about COVID-19, coping mechanisms and general health information were collected. Descriptive analysis was carried out to summarize demographic and participant characteristics, Chi-square analysis to explore associations between categorical variables and anxiety levels and multivariable binary logistic regression analysis to determine predictors of anxiety levels in adults and emotional problems in children. RESULTS: The overall prevalence of GAD in the general population was 71% with younger people (59.8%) and females (51.7%) reporting highest levels of anxiety. Parents who were teachers reported the highest percentage of emotional problems in children (26.7%). Adjusted multivariable logistic regression for GAD-7 scores showed that being female, high levels of worry associated with COVID-19, intention to take the COVID-19 vaccine and smoking were associated with higher levels of anxiety.

CoVs encode an endoribonuclease designated EndoU that facilitates evasion of host pattern recognition receptor MDA5, but the target of EndoU activity was not known. Here, we report that EndoU cleaves the 5'-polyuridines from negative-sense viral RNA, termed PUN RNA, which is the product of polyA-templated RNA synthesis. Using a virus containing an EndoU catalytic-inactive mutation, we detected a higher abundance of PUN RNA in the cytoplasm compared to wild-type-infected cells. Furthermore, we found that transfecting PUN RNA into cells stimulates a robust, MDA5-dependent interferon response, and that removal of the polyuridine extension on the RNA dampens the response. Overall, the results of this study reveal the PUN RNA to be a CoV MDA5-dependent pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP). We also establish a mechanism for EndoU activity to cleave and limit the accumulation of this PAMP. Since EndoU activity is highly conserved in all CoVs, inhibiting this activity may serve as an approach for therapeutic interventions against existing and emerging CoV infections.","Hackbart, Matthew; Deng, Xufang; Baker, Susan C",Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,576,10

Infrared spectroscopy of molecules trapped in helium nanodroplets is a promising methodology for the measurement of thermochemical parameters. When molecules are captured in a helium nanodroplet, the rate of cooling to an equilibrium temperature of ca. 0.4 K is generally faster than the rate of isomerization, resulting in ""shock-freezing"" that kinetically traps molecules in local conformational minima. This unique property enables the study of temperature-dependent conformational equilibria via infrared spectroscopy at 0.4 K, thereby avoiding the deleterious effects of spectral broadening at higher temperatures. Herein, we demonstrate the first application of this approach to ionic species by coupling electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) with helium nanodroplet infrared action spectroscopy to probe the structure and thermochemistry of deprotonated DNA dinucleotides. Dinucleotide anions were generated by ESI, confined in an ion trap at temperatures between 90 and 350 K, and entrained in traversing helium nanodroplets. The infrared action spectra of the entrained ions show a strong dependence on pre-pickup ion temperature, consistent with the preservation of conformer population upon cooling to 0.4 K. Non-negative matrix factorization was utilized to identify component conformer infrared spectra and determine temperature-dependent conformer populations. Relative enthalpies and entropies of conformers were subsequently obtained from a van't Hoff analysis. IR spectra and conformer thermochemistry are compared to results from ion mobility spectrometry (IMS) and electronic structure methods. The implementation of ESI-MS as a source of dopant molecules expands the diversity of molecules accessible for thermochemical measurements, enabling the study of larger, non-volatile species.","Thomas, Daniel A; Chang, Rayoon; Mucha, Eike; Lettow, Maike; Greis, Kim; Gewinner, Sandy; Schöllkopf, Wieland; Meijer, Gerard; von Helden, Gert",,576,24

However, the uncontrollable self-administered measure can be easily affected by insouciantly or deceptively answering, and producing the different results with the clinician-administered Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) and the final diagnosis. Clinically, facial expression (FE) and actions play a vital role in clinician-administered evaluation, while FE and action are underexplored for self-administered evaluations. In this work, we collect a novel dataset of 200 subjects to evidence the validity of self-rating questionnaires with their corresponding question-wise video recording. To automatically interpret depression from the SDS evaluation and the paired video, we propose an end-to-end hierarchical framework for the long-term variable-length video, which is also conditioned on the questionnaire results and the answering time. Specifically, we resort to a hierarchical model which utilizes a 3D CNN for local temporal pattern exploration and a redundancy-aware self-attention (RAS) scheme for question-wise global feature aggregation. Targeting for the redundant long-term FE video processing, our RAS is able to effectively exploit the correlations of each video clip within a question set to emphasize the discriminative information and eliminate the redundancy based on feature pair-wise affinity. Then, the question-wise video feature is concatenated with the questionnaire scores for final depression detection. Our thorough evaluations also show the validity of fusing SDS evaluation and its video recording, and the superiority of our framework to the conventional state-of-the-art temporal modeling methods.","Xie, Wanqing; Liang, Lizhong; Lu, Yao; Wang, Chen; Shen, Jihong; Luo, Hui; Liu, Xiaofeng",,576,24

This study was conducted to explore the anxiety levels of healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic. The study is a cross-sectional study. The population consisted of health care workers employed in hospitals in seven regions in Turkey. All volunteer healthcare workers were included in the study, and 356 healthcare workers responded to the questionnaire. The data were collected using the State Anxiety Inventory and a questionnaire created by the researchers using an online questionnaire between 10 May 2020 and 15 May 2020.

METHODS: The COVID-19 Emergency Department (COVED) Project is an ongoing prospective cohort study that includes all adult patients presenting to The Alfred Hospital ED who undergo testing for SARS-CoV-2. Current guidelines recommend testing for patients with fevers or chills, acute respiratory symptoms or a high-risk exposure history, as well as implementation of infection prevention and control precautions for all suspected and confirmed cases. Study outcomes include a positive SARS-CoV-2 test result and intensive respiratory support. RESULTS: In the period 1-30 April 2020, 702 of 3453 ED patients (20%; 95% CI 19-22) were tested, with a significant increase during the study period (incident rate ratio 1.019; 95% confidence interval 1.017-1.021, P < 0.001). The primary outcome of a positive SARS-CoV-2 test was recorded in 14 patients (2%; 95% confidence interval 1-3). Shortness of breath (77%), fatigue (100%), myalgia (67%) and diarrhoea (67%) were common among positive cases, while close contact (9%), fever (0%) and healthcare occupation (0%) were not. No positive cases required intensive respiratory support in the ED. CONCLUSIONS: The volume of ED patients with suspected COVID-19 is increasing. Low numbers of positive cases precluded development of accurate predictive tools, but the COVED Project is fulfilling an important role in monitoring the burden of infection prevention and control requirements on the ED. The increasing number of patients meeting isolation criteria has the potential to impact on patient flow and may lead to ED overcrowding.","O039,; Reilly, Gerard M; Mitchell, Rob D; Wu, Jamin; Rajiv, Prithi; Bannon-Murphy, Holly; Amos, Timothy; Brichko, Lisa; Brennecke, Helen; Noonan, Michael P; Mitra, Biswadev; Paton, Andrew; Hiller, Ryan; Smit, De Villiers; Luckhoff, Carl; Santamaria, Mark J; Cameron, Peter A",Emerg. med Australas,576,16

Ivermectin (IVM), a macrocyclic lactone with a wide anti-parasitary spectrum, has shown potent activity against SARS-CoV-2 in vitro. This study aimed at assessing the antiviral effect of IVM on viral load of respiratory secretions and its relationship with drug concentrations in plasma. Methods Proof-of-concept, pilot, randomized, controlled, outcome-assessor blinded trial to evaluate antiviral activity of high-dose IVM in 45 COVID-19 hospitalized patients randomized in a 2:1 ratio to standard of care plus oral IVM at 0·6 mg/kg/day for 5 days versus standard of care in 4 hospitals in Argentina. Eligible patients were adults with RT-PCR confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection within 5 days of symptoms onset. The primary endpoint was the difference in viral load in respiratory secretions between baseline and day-5, by quantitative RT-PCR. Concentrations of IVM in plasma were measured. Study registered at ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT04381884. Findings 45 participants were recruited (30 to IVM and 15 controls) between May 18 and September 9, 2020. There was no difference in viral load reduction between groups but a significant difference was found in patients with higher median plasma IVM levels (72% IQR 59–77) versus untreated controls (42% IQR 31–73) (p = 0·004). Mean ivermectin plasma concentration levels correlated with viral decay rate (r: 0·47, p = 0·02). Adverse events were similar between groups. No differences in clinical evolution at day-7 and day-30 between groups were observed. Interpretation A concentration dependent antiviral activity of oral high-dose IVM was identified at a dosing regimen that was well tolerated. Large trials with clinical endpoints are necessary to determine the clinical utility of IVM in COVID-19.

This lymphopenia poses a risk of viral infection. Data to elucidate the herpes virus infection risk in patients with PKD are lacking; therefore, we conducted a national-wide population-based cohort study to investigate the herpes virus risk in PKD patients. METHODS: From the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database (NHIRD), patients who were hospitalized with a diagnosis of polycystic kidney disease were defined as case group of PKD patients; patients without any diagnosis of PKD during the study period were grouped into the non-PKD cohort. The index date was set as the date when the patients were newly diagnosed with PKD. All study patients were followed up until the occurrence of herpes zoster infection, death, withdrawal from the NHIRD for other reasons, or until December 31, 2013. RESULTS: We included 4366 PKD patients and 4366 non-PKD patients. The incidence rate and the risk of developing herpes zoster infection were estimated using multivariate stratified analyses. PKD patients had a 1.97-fold risk of herpes zoster virus infection (aHR = 1.97, 95% CI 1.17-3.31) compared with the non-PKD cohort. On multi-layer stratification, PKD patients without any comorbidities had a significantly increased risk of herpes zoster infection (aHR = 3.10, 95% CI 1.37-7.00). CONCLUSION: This is the first study to reveal a high risk of severe herpes zoster infection in patients with PKD.

Those caring for critically ill patients are especially susceptible due to high patient mortality, long hours, and regular encounters with trauma and ethical issues. Interventions to prevent burnout in this population are needed. Preliminary studies suggest debriefing sessions may reduce burnout. This study aims to assess whether participation in regular debriefing can prevent burnout in intensive care unit (ICU) clinicians. METHODS: A randomized controlled trial will be conducted in two large academic medical centers. Two hundred ICU clinicians will be recruited with target enrollment of 100 physicians and 100 non-physicians (nurses, pharmacists, therapists). Participants must have worked in the ICU for the equivalent of at least 1 full time work week in the preceding 4 weeks. Enrolled subjects will be randomized to virtually attend biweekly debriefing sessions facilitated by a psychotherapist for 3 months or to a control arm without sessions. Our debriefs are modeled after Death Cafés, which are informal discussions focusing on death, dying, loss, grief, and illness. These sessions allow for reflection on distressing events and offer community and collaboration among hospital employees outside of work. The primary outcome is clinician burnout as measured by the Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI) Score. Secondary outcomes include depression and anxiety, as measured by the Patient Health Questionnaire 8 (PHQ-8) and Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item scale (GAD-7), respectively. Questionnaires will be administered prior to the intervention, at 1 month, at 3 months, and at 6 months after enrollment. These values will be compared between groups temporally. Qualitative feedback will also be collected and analyzed. DISCUSSION: With ICU clinician burnout rates exceeding 50%, Death Café debriefing sessions may prove to be an effective tool to avert this debilitating syndrome. With COVID-19 limiting social interactions and overloading ICUs worldwide, the virtual administration of the Death Café for ICU clinicians provides an innovative strategy to potentially mitigate burnout in this vulnerable population.

The implementation of a Closed Loop Medication Administrationsolution aims to reduce medication administration errorsand prevent patient harm.Aim: We conducted the first evaluation to assess the impact of a novel optical medication scanning device, MedEye,on the rate of medication administration errors in solid oraldosage forms.Methods: We performed a before and after study on oneward at a tertiary-care teaching hospital that used a commercial electronic prescribing and medication administrationsystem and was implementing MedEye (a bedside tool forstopping and preventing medication administration errors).Pre-MedEye data collection occurred between Aug-Nov2019 and post-MedEye data collection occurred betweenFeb-Mar 2020. We conducted direct observations of nursingdrug administration rounds before and after the MedEyeimplementation. Observers recorded what they observedbeing administered (e.g., drug name, form, strength andquantity) and compared this to what was prescribed. Errorswere classified as either a 'timing' error, 'omission' error or'other' error. We calculated the rate and type of medicationadministration errors (MAEs) before and after the MedEyeimplementation. A sample size calculation suggested thatapproximately 10,000 medication administrations wereneeded. Data collection was reduced due to the COVID 19pandemic and implementation delays.Results: Trained pharmacists or nurses observed a total of1,069 administrations of solid oral dosage forms before and432 after the MedEye intervention was implemented. Thepercentage of MAEs pre-MedEye (69.1%) and post-MedEye(69.9%) remained almost the same. Non-timing errors(combination of 'omission' + 'other' errors) reduced from 51(4.77%) to 11 (2.55%), which had borderline significance(p=0.05) however after adjusting for confounders, significance was lost. We also saw a non-significant reduction in'other' error types (e.g., dose and documentation errors) following the implementation of MedEye from 34 (3.2%) to 7(1.62%). An observer witnessed a nurse dispense the wrongmedication (prednisolone) instead of the intended medication(furosemide) in the post-MedEye period. After receiving a notification from MedEye that an unexpected medication hadbeen dispensed, the nurse corrected the dose thus preventingan error. We also identified one instance where the nurse correctly dispensed a prescribed medication (amlodipine) butthis was mistakenly identified by the MedEye scanner as another prescribed medication (metoclopramide).Conclusions: This is the first evaluation of a novel opticalmedication scanning device, MedEye on the rate of MAEs inone of the largest NHS trusts in England. We found a nonstatistically significant reduction in non-timing error rates.This was notable because incidents within this category e.g.,dose errors, are more likely to be associated with harm compared to timing errors.2 However, further research is neededto investigate the impact of MedEye on a larger sample sizeand range of medications.","Tolley, C.

METHODS: Data were obtained from the U.S. National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey from 1988 to 1994 (N = 7817) and 1999-2002 (N = 2344). We fit Cox proportional hazard models to examine the relationship between C-reactive protein (CRP) and fibrinogen with cancer mortality. RESULTS: In the full Cox multivariate model, clinically raised CRP was associated with cancer mortality in NHANES 1988-1994 (> 0.99 mg/dL: 95%CI: 1.04-2.13). However, across two inflammatory biomarkers (CRP and Fibrinogen), two NHANES time periods (1998-1994 and 1999-2002) and three income levels (12 strata in total), Hazard ratio confidence intervals did not include the null only for one association: CRP and cancer mortality among low income participants from 1988 to 1994 (HR = 1.83, 95% CI: 1.10-3.04). CONCLUSIONS: We find evidence that only in one unique stratum is earlier life CRP, and not fibrinogen, associated with prospective cancer mortality. After more complete control for socioeconomic confounding, CRP and fibrinogen do not predict cancer mortality in most subpopulations.","Chan, Joshua E; Mann, Amandeep K; Kapp, Daniel S; Rehkopf, David H",BMC Public Health,576,24

There has been limited research on the impact of anticoagulant and antiplatelet choice in COVID-19. MethodsThis was a single-centre retrospective cohort study of 933 patients with COVID-19 infection presenting between 01/02/2020 and 31/05/2020. Survival time at 90 days post-diagnosis and thromboembolism development were the measured outcomes. ResultsOf 933 total patients, mean age was 68 years and 54.4% were male. 297 (31.8%) did not survive at 90 days. A Cox proportional hazards model analysis found no statistically significant relationship between anticoagulant or antiplatelet choice and survival (p<0.05). 57 (6.3%) developed thromboembolism. Antiplatelet choice was not shown to have a statistically significant relationship with thromboembolism development. Warfarin and direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC) use did not have a statistically significant impact on thromboembolism development (p<0.05). Therapeutic low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) use was associated with increased thromboembolism risk (Odds ratio = 14.327, 95% CI 1.904 - 107.811, p = 0.010). ConclusionsAntiplatelet choice was shown to have no impact on survival or thromboembolism development in COVID-19. Anticoagulant choice did not impact survival or thromboembolism development, aside from LMWH. Therapeutic LMWH use was associated with increased risk of thromboembolism. However, it should be noted that the sample size for patients using therapeutic LMWH was small (n=4), and there may be confounding variables affecting both LMWH use and thromboembolism development. These findings should be repeated with a larger sample of patients using therapeutic LMWH with additional adjustment for cofounding variables.","Salmon, Thomas; Titley, Mitchell; Noori, Zaid; Crosby, Mark; Sankaranarayanan, Rajiv",,576,26

Considering the short time spent after its prevalence, limited information is known about the effect of the virus mechanism on different organs of the body; meanwhile the lack of specific treatment and vaccine for this virus has exposed millions of people to a big challenge. AREAS COVERED: The review article aims to describe the general and particular characteristics of CoVs, their classification, genome structure, host cell infection, cytokine storm, anti-viral treatments, and inhibition of COVID-19-related ER-mitochondrial stress. In addition, it refers to drugs such as Chloroquine/Hydroxychloroquine, Lopinavir/Ritonavir, darunavir, ribavirin, remdesivir, and favipiravir, which have undergone clinical trials for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) treatment. This analysis was derived from an extensive scientific literature search including Pubmed, ScienceDirect, and Google Scholar performed. EXPERT OPINION: The effectiveness rate and complications of these drugs can reveal new insights into the potential therapeutic goals for the disease. Moreover, lifestyle change can effectively prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Zarandi, Peyman Kheirandish; Zinatizadeh, Mohammad Reza; Zinatizadeh, Maryam; Yousefi, Mohammad Hadi; Rezaei, Nima",Biomed Pharmacother,576,1

An online sample of 2,860 Croatian adults filled in questionnaires on socio-demographic characteristics, distress (the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale 21), coping (the Brief COPE), personality (the International Personality Item Pool), and social support (the Duke-UNC Functional Social Support Questionnaire) during the COVID-19 lockdown and after the capital was hit by an earthquake. Results indicated that 15.9% of the respondents experienced severe to extreme depression, 10.7% severe to extreme anxiety, and 26.2% severe to extreme stress. The hierarchical regressions analysis indicated that the considered variables explained a substantial percentage of the variance in depression (51.4%), anxiety (35.2%), and stress (45.5%). Main predictors of emotional distress were lower scores of Emotional Stability, higher scores of Agreeableness, avoidant coping, lack of active coping, and perceived social support. The negative effect of the earthquake was weak. Results provide information on a broad range of potentially protective or vulnerability factors that could help identify those at risk for developing coronavirus-related psychological distress. Findings suggest that promoting active coping styles and social interactions could be preventive and potentially therapeutic in general populations.","Margetic, Branimir; Peraica, Tina; Stojanovic, Kristina; Ivanec, Dragutin",Pers Individ Dif,576,20

N95 respirators are commonly used to protect healthcare workers from respiratory pathogens, including the novel coronavirus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, and are increasingly employed by other frontline workers and the general public. Under routine circumstances, these masks are disposable, single-use items, but extended use and reuse practices have been broadly enacted to alleviate critical supply shortages during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. Although extended-time single use presents a low risk of pathogen transfer, repeated donning and doffing of potentially contaminated masks presents increased risk of pathogen transfer. Therefore, efficient and safe decontamination methods for N95 masks are needed to reduce the risk of reuse and mitigate local supply shortages. Here, we review the available literature concerning use of germicidal ultraviolet-C (UV-C) light to decontaminate N95 masks. We propose a practical method for repeated point-of-use decontamination using commercially available UV-C cross-linker boxes from molecular biology laboratories to expose each side of the mask to 800-1200 mJ/cm2 of UV-C. We measure the dose that penetrated to the interior of the respirators and model the potential germicidal action on coronaviruses. Our experimental results, in combination with modeled data, suggest that such a UV-C treatment cycle should induce a >3-log-order reduction in viral bioburden on the surface of the respirators and a 2-log-order reduction throughout the interior. We find that a dose 50-fold greater does not impair filtration or fit of 3M 8210 N95 masks, indicating that decontamination can be performed repeatedly. As such, UV-C germicidal irradiation is a practical strategy for small-scale point-of-use decontamination of N95s.","Huber, Thomas; Goldman, Olivia; Epstein, Alexander E; Stella, Gianna; Sakmar, Thomas P",Biophys. j,576,24

Monitoring of infection rates and seroprevalence can guide public health measures to combat the pandemic. This depends on reliable tests on active and former infections. Here, we set out to develop and validate a specific and sensitive enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for detection of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody levels. METHODS: In our ELISA, we used SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain (RBD) and a stabilized version of the spike (S) ectodomain as antigens. We assessed sera from patients infected with seasonal coronaviruses, SARS-CoV-2 and controls. We determined and monitored IgM-, IgA- and IgG-antibody responses towards these antigens. In addition, for a panel of 22 sera, virus neutralization and ELISA parameters were measured and correlated. RESULTS: The RBD-based ELISA detected SARS-CoV-2-directed antibodies, did not cross-react with seasonal coronavirus antibodies and correlated with virus neutralization (R2 = 0.89). Seroconversion started at 5 days after symptom onset and led to robust antibody levels at 10 days after symptom onset. We demonstrate high specificity (99.3%; N = 1000) and sensitivity (92% for IgA, 96% for IgG and 98% for IgM; > 10 days after PCR-proven infection; N = 53) in serum. CONCLUSIONS: With the described RBD-based ELISA protocol, we provide a reliable test for seroepidemiological surveys. Due to high specificity and strong correlation with virus neutralization, the RBD ELISA holds great potential to become a preferred tool to assess thresholds of protective immunity after infection and vaccination.","Peterhoff, David; Glück, Vivian; Vogel, Matthias; Schuster, Philipp; Schütz, Anja; Neubert, Philip; Albert, Veruschka; Frisch, Stefanie; Kiessling, Mara; Pervan, Philip; Werner, Maren; Ritter, Nicole; Babl, Leon; Deichner, Maria; Hanses, Frank; Lubnow, Matthias; Müller, Thomas; Lunz, Dirk; Hitzenbichler, Florian; Audebert, Franz; Hähnel, Viola; Offner, Robert; Müller, Martina; Schmid, Stephan; Burkhardt, Ralph; Glück, Thomas; Koller, Michael; Niller, Hans Helmut; Graf, Bernhard; Salzberger, Bernd; Wenzel, Jürgen J; Jantsch, Jonathan; Gessner, André; Schmidt, Barbara; Wagner, Ralf",Infection,576,20

Among the several explanations proposed, an early and large testing of the population was put forward. Most current debates on COVID-19 focus on the differences among countries, but little attention has been given to regional differences and diet. The low-death rate European countries (e.g. Austria, Baltic States, Czech Republic, Finland, Norway, Poland, Slovakia) have used different quarantine and/or confinement times and methods and none have performed as many early tests as Germany. Among other factors that may be significant are the dietary habits. It seems that some foods largely used in these countries may reduce angiotensin-converting enzyme activity or are anti-oxidants. Among the many possible areas of research, it might be important to understand diet and angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) levels in populations with different COVID-19 death rates since dietary interventions may be of great benefit.","Bousquet, Jean; Anto, Josep M.; Iaccarino, Guido; Czarlewski, Wienczyslawa; Haahtela, Tari; Anto, Aram; Akdis, Cezmi A.; Blain, Hubert; Canonica, G.

Up to now, the mechanisms triggering the initiation and progression of the disease are, in their complexity, not fully understood and imply the disruption of several tolerance networks. Viral infection is one of the environmental factors triggering diabetes, which is initially based on the observation that the disease's incidence follows a periodic pattern within the population. Moreover, the strong correlation of genetic susceptibility is a prerequisite for enteroviral infection associated islet autoimmunity. Epidemiological data and clinical findings indicate enteroviral infections, mainly of the coxsackie B virus family, as potential pathogenic mechanisms to trigger the autoimmune reaction towards ß-cells, resulting in the boost of inflammation following ß-cell destruction and the onset of T1D. This review discusses previously identified virus-associated genetics and pathways of ß-cell destruction. Is it the virus itself which leads to ß-cell destruction and T1D progression? Or is it genetic, so that the virus may activate auto-immunity and ß-cell destruction only in genetically predisposed individuals?","Geravandi, Shirin; Liu, Huan; Maedler, Kathrin",,576,20

Countries in the Northern Hemisphere have been affected the most, including the United States and European countries. Contrary to the common knowledge that infectious diseases are more prevalent in low- and middle-income countries, COVID-19 appears to affect wealthy countries more. This paper attempts to quantify the relationship between COVID-19 infections and levels of economic development with data from the U.S. and Europe. Methods: Public domain data on the confirmed COVID-19 cases during January 1 and May 31, 2020 by states and territories in the U.S. and by countries in Europe were included. Incidence rate was estimated using the 2019 total population. COVID-19 cases were associated with 2019 GDP using regression models after a logarithmic transformation of the data. The U.S. data and European data were analyzed separately, considering significant heterogeneity between the two. Results: A total of 2 451 691 COVID-19 cases during a 5-month period were analyzed, including 1 787 414 from 50 U.S. states and territories and 664 277 from 28 European countries. The overall incidence rate was 5.393/1000 for the U.S. and 1.411/1 000 for European countries with large variations. Lg (total cases) was significantly associated with lg (GDP) for U.S. states (= 1.2579, P < 0.001) and European countries (= 0.7156, P < 0.001), respectively. Conclusion: This study demonstrated a positive correlation between COVID-19 case incidence and GDP. Study findings suggest a potential role of high-level development in facilitating infectious disease spread, such as better domestic and international travel for businesses and leisure, more personal freedom and more group activities. These factors must be considered in controlling the COVID-19 epidemic.","Aycock, Lauren; Chen, Xinguang",,576,24

The aim of this review is to summarize available evidence providing an official position statement of the Italian Society of Andrology and Sexual Medicine (SIAMS) METHODS: A comprehensive Pubmed, Web of Science, Embase, Medline and Cochrane library search was performed. Due to the limited evidence and the lack of studies, it was not possible to formulate recommendations according to the Oxford 2011 Levels of Evidence criteria. RESULTS: Several molecular characteristics of the SARS-CoV-2 can justify the presence of virus within the testis and possible alterations of spermatogenesis and endocrine function. Orchitis has been reported as a possible complication of SARS-CoV infection, but similar findings have not been reported for SARS-CoV-2. Alternatively, the orchitis could be the result of a vasculitis as COVID-19 has been associated with abnormalities in coagulation and the segmental vascularization of the testis could account for an orchitis-like syndrome. Finally, available data do not support the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in plasma seminal fluid of infected subjects. CONCLUSION: Data derived from other SARS-CoV infections suggest that in patients recovered from COVID-19, especially for those in reproductive age, andrological consultation and evaluation of gonadal function including semen analysis should be suggested. Studies in larger cohorts of currently infected subjects are warranted to confirm (or exclude) the presence of risks for male gametes that are destined either for cryopreservation in liquid nitrogen or for assisted reproduction techniques.","Corona, G; Baldi, E; Isidori, A M; Paoli, D; Pallotti, F; De Santis, L; Francavilla, F; La Vignera, S; Selice, R; Caponecchia, L; Pivonello, R; Ferlin, A; Foresta, C; Jannini, E A; Lenzi, A; Maggi, M; Lombardo, F",J Endocrinol Invest,576,24

We showed that while our proposed model is trained on a relatively small dataset acquired from only one imaging center using a specific scanning protocol, the model performs well on heterogeneous test sets obtained by multiple scanners using different technical parameters. We also showed that the model can be updated via an unsupervised approach to cope with the data shift between the train and test sets and enhance the robustness of the model upon receiving a new external dataset from a different center. We adopted an ensemble architecture to aggregate the predictions from multiple versions of the model. For initial training and development purposes, an in-house dataset of 171 COVID-19, 60 CAP, and 76 Normal cases was used, which contained volumetric CT scans acquired from one imaging center using a constant standard radiation dose scanning protocol. To evaluate the model, we collected four different test sets retrospectively to investigate the effects of the shifts in the data characteristics on the model's performance. Among the test cases, there were CT scans with similar characteristics as the train set as well as noisy low-dose and ultra-low dose CT scans. In addition, some test CT scans were obtained from patients with a history of cardiovascular diseases or surgeries. The entire test dataset used in this study contained 51 COVID-19, 28 CAP, and 51 Normal cases.

METHODS: We undertook a longitudinal study of 20 of 51 consecutive CVD patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) who met the study criteria. We used the Life-Space Assessment (LSA) tool to evaluate Life-space mobility and assessed QoL with the five-level EuroQoL five-dimensional questionnaire (EQ-5D-5L) in Japanese. RESULTS: The LSA scores and EQ-5D-5L QoL score decreased significantly from the pre- to post-nationwide state of emergency in Japan (p < 0.01). &#916;LSA was significantly positively associated with body mass index and significantly negatively associated with knee extensor muscle strength and pre-LSA score (p < 0.05).

However, some patients may suffer from other pulmonary abnormalities that can be worsened by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and they may consequently require lung surgery. COVID-19 affects the indications, surgical procedure, and postsurgical care of these patients. Background: We present a case of a 14-year-old girl with COVID-19 pulmonary disease and persistent air leak due to right apical bullae that required resection. Clinical, surgical, and safety implications are discussed. The role of thoracic minimally invasive surgery under COVID-19 conditions is also analyzed. Materials and Methods: The thoracoscopic procedure was scheduled earlier than normally expected. The surgery was performed in a COVID-19 reserved theatre with neutral pressure and only the necessary personnel was allowed inside. The use of the required personal protective equipment was supervised by an expert nurse before and after the intervention. Results: The surgeons used a three-port technique to resect the bullae with an endostapler and no mechanical pleural abrasion was added to the procedure. Electrocautery and CO2 insufflation were avoided, and a chest drain with a closed-circuit aspiration system was installed before removing the ports. The child was discharged home 3 days later after the removal of the chest drain. Conclusions: COVID-19 has an impact on the standard indications, surgical strategies and postoperative care of some conditions requiring intervention. Extra safety measures are needed in the operating room to limit the chance of transmission. Minimally invasive surgery for thoracic surgery remains safe if the current safety guidelines are followed closely.","Giné, Carlos; Laín, Ana; García, Laura; López, Manuel",J Laparoendosc Adv Surg Tech A,576,29
407993,407993,407993,Mosaic vaccination schedule: An unexpected card to play against SARS-CoV-2?,11.116208,11.551659,2021,"BackgroundThe SIR model is often used to analyse and forecast the expansion of an epidemic. In this model, the number of patients exponentially increases and decreases, resulting in two phases. Therefore, in these phases, the logarithm of infectious patients changes at a constant rate, the logarithmic growth rate K. However, in the case of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID19) epidemic, K never remains constant but increases and decreases linearly; therefore, the SIR model does not fit that seen in reality. We would like to clarify the cause of this phenomenon and predict the occurrence of COVID19 epidemics. MethodsWe simulated a situation in which smaller epidemics were repeated with short time intervals. The results were compared with the epidemic data from 279 countries and regions. ResultsIn the simulations, the K values increased and decreased linearly, similar to the real data. Because the previous peak covered the initial increase in the epidemic, K did not increase as much as expected; rather, the difference in the basic reproduction number R0 appeared in the slope of increasing K. Additionally, the mean infectious time{tau} appeared in the negative peaks of K. By using the R0 and{tau} estimated from the changes in K, changes in the number of patients could be approximated using the SIR model. This supports the appropriateness of the model for evaluating COVID-19 epidemics. By using the model, the distributions of the parameters were identified. On average, an epidemic started every eleven days in a country. The worldwide mean R0 was 2.9; however, this value showed an exponential character and could thus increase explosively. In addition, the average{tau} was 12 days; this is not the native value but represents a shortened period because of the isolation of patients. As{tau} represents the half-life, the infectious time varies among patients; hence, prior testing should be performed before isolation is lifted. The changes in K represented the state of epidemics and were several weeks to a month ahead of the changes in the number of confirmed cases. In the actual data, when K was positive on consecutive days, the number of patients increased a few weeks later. In addition, if the negative peaks of K could not be reduced to as small as 0.1, the number of patients remained high. Thus, the number of K-positive days and mean infectious time had a clear correlation with the total number of patients. In such cases, mortality, which was lognormally distributed, with a mean of 1.7%, increased. To control the epidemic, it is important to observe K daily, not to allow K to remain positive continuously, and to terminate a peak with a series of K-negative days. To do this, it was necessary to shorten{tau} by finding and isolating a patient earlier. The effectiveness of the countermeasures is apparent in{tau} . The effect of vaccination, in terms of controlling the epidemic, was limited.","Konishi, Tomokazu",,576,15

OBJECTIVE: To analyze the clinical characteristics of elderly patients with 2019 new-type coronavirus pneumonia (COVID-19). METHODS: This is a retrospective study of patients with new coronavirus pneumonia (COVID-19) who were hospitalized in Hainan Provincial People's Hospital from January 15, 2020 to February 18, 2020. Compare the clinical characteristics of elderly with Young and Middle-aged patients. RESULTS: A total of 56 patients were enrolled 18 elderly patients (32.14%), and 38 young and middle-aged patients (67.86%). The most common symptoms in both groups were fever, followed by cough and sputum. Four patients in the elderly group received negative pressure ICU for mechanical ventilation, and five patients in the young and middle-aged group. One patient died in the elderly group (5.56%), and two patients died in the young and middle-aged group (5.26%). The PSI score of the elderly group was higher than that of the young and middle-aged group (P < 0.001). The proportion of patients with PSI grades IV and V was significantly higher in the elderly group than in the young and middle-aged group (P < 0.05). The proportion of multiple lobe involvement in the elderly group was higher than that in the young and middle-aged group (P < 0.001), and there was no difference in single lobe lesions between the two groups. The proportion of lymphocytes in the elderly group was significantly lower than that in the young and middle-aged group (P < 0.001), and the C-reactive protein was significantly higher in the young group (P < 0.001). The Lopinavir and Ritonavir Tablets, Chinese medicine, oxygen therapy, and mechanical ventilation were statistically different in the elderly group and the young and middle-aged group, and the P values were all <0.05. INTERPRETATION: The mortality of elderly patients with COVID-19 is higher than that of young and middle-aged patients, and the proportion of patients with PSI grade IV and V is significantly higher than that of young and middle-aged patients.

METHODS: We conducted an e-survey using a cloud-based website to gauge the potential sources of trustworthy information and misinformation and analyzed researchers', clinicians', and academics' attitude toward unpublished items, and pre- and post-publication quality checks in this challenging time. RESULTS: Among 128 respondents (mean age, 43.2 years; M:F, 1.1:1), 60 (46.9%) were scholarly journal editors and editorial board members. Social media channels were distinguished as the most important sources of information as well as misinformation (81 [63.3%] and 86 [67.2%]). Nearly two in five (62, 48.4%) respondents blamed reviewers, editors, and misinterpretation by readers as additional contributors alongside authors for misinformation. A higher risk of plagiarism was perceived by the majority (70, 58.6%), especially plagiarism of ideas (64.1%) followed by inappropriate paraphrasing (54.7%). Opinion was divided on the utility of preprints for changing practice and changing retraction rates during the pandemic period, and higher rejections were not supported by most (76.6%) while the importance of peer review was agreed upon by a majority (80, 62.5%). More stringent screening by journal editors (61.7%), and facilitating open access plagiarism software (59.4%), including Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based algorithms (43.8%) were among the suggested solutions. Most (74.2%) supported the need to launch a specialist bibliographic database for COVID-19, with information indexed (62.3%), available as open-access (82.8%), after expanding search terms (52.3%) and following due verification by academics (66.4%), and journal editors (52.3%). CONCLUSION: While identifying social media as a potential source of misinformation on COVID-19, and a perceived high risk of plagiarism, more stringent peer review and skilled post-publication promotion are advisable. Journal editors should play a more active role in streamlining publication and promotion of trustworthy information on COVID-19.","Gupta, Latika; Gasparyan, Armen Yuri; Misra, Durga Prasanna; Agarwal, Vikas; Zimba, Olena; Yessirkepov, Marlen",J Korean Med Sci,576,14

It creates an atmosphere of lack of trust that often leads individuals into making risky decisions. In contexts of high uncertainty, the flow of counter-knowledge is likely to increase. Although scientists and scientific institutions can provide knowledge based on evidence and verifiable facts, they may find it difficult to react to the proliferation of counter-knowledge which affects their own credibility. This paper adopts concepts derived from the knowledge management field to shed light on this problem. Examples from the recent history of Italy are discussed. Useful lessons for the public and policymakers are derived. These lessons become particularly relevant in the context of a crisis such as the COVID-19 pandemic, as the world experiences a combination of factors that provide a fertile ground for the emergence of both scientific knowledge and social counter-knowledge. © Operational Research Society 2021.","Bolisani, E.; Cegarra Navarro, J.

However, the titers of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies varied in each individual, and the precise factors that might govern such variation have not been elucidated. Objectives: To assess the factors associated with high titers of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody among COVID-19 convalescent plasma (CCP) donors. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted in Saiful Anwar General Hospital, Malang, Indonesia. Information of interest including demographic characteristics, clinical symptoms, comorbidities, laboratory findings, and the titers of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody among COVID-19 CCP donors were collected. The correlation was assessed using multiple logistic regression. Results: A total of 50 COVID-19 CCP donors with the titers of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody of more than 1:320 and 33 donors with the titers of less than 1:320 were analyzed. Our analysis revealed that CCP donors with history of cough, fever, dyspnea, and pneumonia significantly had higher titers of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody compared to asymptomatic donors. Moreover, CCP donors with elevated levels of eosinophils and immature granulocytes and low levels of albumins had higher levels of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody. The titer of antibody was not affected by comorbidities of donors. Conclusions: CPP donors who had experience of symptomatic COVID-19 with high eosinophils level, high immature granulocytes and low albumin level have higher titers of anti-SARS-COV-2 antibody than those who experienced asymptomatic COVID-19. Our current findings may be used as the additional baseline criteria for selecting the donors of CCP for the management of COVID-19.","Wardhani, Shinta Oktya; Fajar, Jonny Karunia; Nurarifah, Nina; Hermanto, Djoko Heri; Fatonah, Siti; Djajalaksana, Susanthy; Fatoni, Arie Zainul; Arsana, Putu Moda; Wulandari, Laksmi; Soegiarto, Gatot; Dhama, Kuldeep; Harapan, Harapan",Clin Epidemiol Glob Health,576,24

Transplant recipients are considered particularly vulnerable to pathogens due to immunosuppression, and SARS-CoV-2 is likely to generate complications if contracted. Several signs and symptoms observed in COVID-19 positive patients reflect damage to multiple organs and tissues, raising the possibility of extra-pulmonary SARS-CoV-2 infections and risk of transmission. At the beginning of the pandemic, a consensus has emerged not to consider COVID-19 positive patients as potential living or deceased donors, resulting in a global decrease in transplantation procedures. Medical decision making at the time of organ allocation must consider safely alongside the survival advantages offered by transplantation. To address the risk of transmission by transplantation, this review summarizes the published cases of transplantation of cells or organs from donors infected with SARS-CoV-2 and assesses the current state of knowledge for the detection of this virus in different biological specimens, cells, tissues and organs. Evidence collected to date raises the possibility of SARS-CoV-2 infection and replication in some CTO, which makes it impossible to exclude transmission through transplantation. However, most studies focused on evaluating transmission under laboratory conditions with inconsistent findings, rendering the comparison of results difficult. Improved standardization of donors and CTO screening practices, along with a systematic follow-up of transplant recipients could facilitate the assessment of SARS-CoV-2 transmission risk by transplantation.

This demand has led countries to adopt varying surge-facility or alternate care site (ACS) models to manage patient overflow. This report describes the experience of setting up pharmacy services at a city-run surge facility in Philadelphia. SUMMARY: The COVID-19 Surge Facility at the Liacouras Center (CSF-L) was initially developed to serve as a site for patients convalescing from acute inpatient stays in order to free up healthcare resources in surrounding hospitals. The CSF-L site required a distinct set of services to provide the desired level of care. This report details the preparations and challenges faced by the CSF-L pharmacy team in this endeavor, including identifying a pharmacy location that met regulatory requirements, obtaining proper licenses, coordinating drug procurement, filling staffing requirements, developing a formulary, defining the pharmacy and medication management workflow, and ensuring safety protocols were followed. This report explains the rational for developing certain processes and suggests alternative options and ideal plans for developing future pharmacy services in an ACS. CONCLUSION: Identifying a pharmacy leadership team early in the ACS planning process can lead to more efficient plans for pharmacy services. This report details the important steps taken, decisions made, and challenges faced in setting up pharmaceutical services at a COVID-19 field hospital.","Warr, Dillon; Storey, Eileen; Denys, Mark; Brown, Suzanne; Rose, Christina",Am. j. health system pharm,576,1

METHODS: Clinical data of patients with severe H1N1 influenza virus pneumonia implemented by ECMO in the First Affiliated Hospital of Wannan Medical College from October 2018 to December 2019 were retrospective analyzed, including general information, ECMO transport distance, time, clinical parameters before and after ECMO, including the patients' oxygenation index (PaO2/FiO2), respiratory rate (RR), pulse blood oxygen saturation (SpO2), arterial blood carbon dioxide partial pressure (PaCO2), and pH value, various complications during transport, mechanical ventilation time, patients' prognosis and other indicators. Experience from the aspects of personal protection, transport process and equipment, team cooperation, mid-transit monitoring, quality control, etc., was summarized to provide suggestions for patients with severe COVID-19 using ECMO during inter-hospital transport and protection. RESULTS: A total of 6 patients with severe H1N1 influenza virus pneumonia were transported on ECMO. All patients were transported to the intensive care unit (ICU) of the First Affiliated Hospital of Wannan Medical College by the ECMO transport team after the establishment of ECMO in the local hospital. The transfer distance was 11 to 197 km, with an average of (93.8±58.6) km; the transfer time was 30 to 150 minutes, with an average of (79.2±40.6) minutes. Two patients experienced a drop in ECMO flow and SpO2 during the process, and the main reason was insufficient volume, which was improved after fluid resuscitation and posture adjustment. All patients maintained SpO2 above 0.93. Six patients survived and were discharged. ECMO assisted time was 4-9 days, with an average of (6.5±1.5) days; mechanical ventilation time was 7-24 days, and median time was 10.0 (8.0, 14.5) days. No H1N1 transmission occurred in medical personnel. To achieve good therapeutic effect, the main experience was to choose the proper timing and mode of ECMO; intact transportation vehicles and equipment to reduce or avoid mechanical complications; the effective management of respiration and circulation during the transportation to avoid ventilation-associated lung injury (VALI) and serious hypoxemia; the appropriate space for the transfer team to quickly handle various critical situations; and personal protection to avoid infection. CONCLUSIONS: With an experienced ECMO transport team, good transport equipment, comprehensive protection measures, reasonable transport procedures, and a perfect emergency plan, it is safe to use ECMO transport for COVID-19 patients.","Xu, Qiancheng; Jiang, Xiaogan; Wang, Tao; Zhou, Quan; Wang, Jun; Zhang, Peng; Yang, Shangzhi; Yan, Hao; Tao, Xiubin; Lu, Weihua",Zhonghua Wei Zhong Bing Ji Jiu Yi Xue,576,20

There are global efforts toward the development and trial of COVID-19 vaccines. However, considering the challenges and economic conditions of African nations, there could be limited access and availability of the vaccines on the continent. This will be the result of high cost and technical requirements to acquire the vaccines. There are indications that possible donor funding for COVID-19 vaccines from rich countries maybe put off considering the various challenges they face currently and the moves they are making in response to the disease. The issue of justice in health for protecting the vulnerable populations and regions also supports the need for COVID-19 vaccine availability on the African continent. Means to achieve uniform control of the disease burden across the globe should be adopted. Governments of African nations should also scale up their efforts toward COVID-19 vaccine acquisition and utilization through viable efforts. It is therefore important to assist the African continent in acquiring the COVID-19 vaccines by leveling all power dynamics that will affect access and distribution","Ogunkola, I. O.; Imo, U.

The study used the number of factors that affect poverty incidence in a panel of 76 countries for a period of 2010-2019. The dynamic panel GMM estimates show that the causes of death by communicable diseases, chemical-induced carbon and fossil fuel combustion, and lack of access to basic hand washing facilities menace to increase poverty headcounts, whereas, an increase in healthcare expenditures substantially decreases poverty headcounts across countries. Further, the results show the U-shaped relationship between economic growth and poverty headcounts, as economic growth first decreases and later increase poverty headcount due to rising healthcare disparities among nations. The causality estimates show that lack of access to basic amenities lead to increase of communicable diseases including COVID-19 whereas chemical-induced carbon and fossil fuel emissions continue to increase healthcare expenditures and economic growth in a panel of selected countries. The rising healthcare disparities, regional conflicts, and public debt burden further 'hold in the hand' of communicable diseases that push millions of people in the poverty trap.","Anser, Muhammad Khalid; Yousaf, Zahid; Khan, Muhammad Azhar; Nassani, Abdelmohsen A; Alotaibi, Saad M; Qazi Abro, Muhammad Moinuddin; Vo, Xuan Vinh; Zaman, Khalid",Environ Res,576,1

The double burden of infectious and chronic diseases constitutes major causes of morbidity and mortality. Over the last two decades, there has been a rise in infectious diseases, including the severe acute respiratory syndrome virus (SARS), the H1N1 pandemic influenza, the Ebolavirus and the Covid-19 virus. These diseases have rapidly spread across the world and have reminded us of the unprecedented connectivity that defines our modern civilization. Though some countries have made substantial progress toward improving global surveillance for emerging infectious diseases (EIDs), the vast majority of Low-and Middle-income Countries (LMICs) with fragile health systems and various system-related bottlenecks remain vulnerable to outbreaks and, as such, experience dramatic social and economic consequences when they are reported. Lessons learned from past outbreaks suggest that gender inequalities are common across a range of health issues relating to Sexual and Reproductive Health and Rights (SRHR), with women being particularly disadvantaged, partially due to the burden placed on them. Though these countries are striving to improve their health systems and be more inclusive to this vulnerable group, the national/ global outbreaks have burdened the overall system and thus paralyzed normal services dedicated to the delivery of Sexual and Reproductive Health (SRH) services. In this paper, we discuss the global commitments to SRH, the impact of the EIDs on the LMICs, the failure in the delivery of SRH services, and the strategies for successful implementation of recovery plans that must address the specific and differentiated needs of women and girls in resource-poor settings.","Chattu, Vijay Kumar; Yaya, Sanni",Reprod Health,576,16

We hypothesized that if negative dominance appeared, it would be a reflection of peaks in adverse events related to the vaccine, that negative content would attract more engagement on social media than other vaccine-related posts, and posts referencing adverse events related to COVID-19 vaccination would have a higher average toxicity score. METHODS: We collected data using Google Trends for search behavior, CrowdTangle for social media data, and Media Cloud for media stories, and compared them against the dates of key adverse events related to COVID-19. We used Communalytic to analyze the toxicity of social media posts by platform and topic. RESULTS: While our first hypothesis was partially supported, with peaks in search behavior for image and YouTube videos driven by adverse events, we did not find negative dominance in other types of searches or patterns of attention by news media or on social media. CONCLUSION: We did not find evidence in our data to prove the negative dominance of adverse events related to COVID-19 vaccination on social media. Future studies should corroborate these findings and, if consistent, focus on explaining why this may be the case.","Pascual-Ferrá, Paola; Alperstein, Neil; Barnett, Daniel J",Disaster Med Public Health Prep,576,20

Integrating person-environment fit theory and the theory of exploitation and exploration, this study links person-app fit and person-brand fit to explorative use and exploitative use of a branded app, which both contribute to customer decision performance. Perceived fluency toward cross-channel integration positively moderates the fit-use linkages. Data obtained from 835 app users verify all of the proposed hypotheses. Results indicate that customers with different fits (person-app fit and person-brand fit) hold different thoughts toward their exploitative use and explorative use, which add equal value to support their decision making.

The aim of this study was to identify the perceived consequences of this on staff and their work and on students and their studies at universities. METHOD: The study used a variety of methods, which involved an on-line survey on the influences of social isolation using a non-probability sampling. More specifically, two techniques were used, namely a convenience sampling (i.e. involving members of the academic community, which are easy to reach by the study team), supported by a snow ball sampling (recruiting respondents among acquaintances of the participants). A total of 711 questionnaires from 41 countries were received. Descriptive statistics were deployed to analyse trends and to identify socio-demographic differences. Inferential statistics were used to assess significant differences among the geographical regions, work areas and other socio-demographic factors related to impacts of social isolation of university staff and students. RESULTS: The study reveals that 90% of the respondents have been affected by the shutdown and unable to perform normal work or studies at their institution for between 1 week to 2 months. While 70% of the respondents perceive negative impacts of COVID 19 on their work or studies, more than 60% of them value the additional time that they have had indoors with families and others. . CONCLUSIONS: While the majority of the respondents agree that they suffered from the lack of social interaction and communication during the social distancing/isolation, there were significant differences in the reactions to the lockdowns between academic staff and students. There are also differences in the degree of influence of some of the problems, when compared across geographical regions. In addition to policy actions that may be deployed, further research on innovative methods of teaching and communication with students is needed in order to allow staff and students to better cope with social isolation in cases of new or recurring pandemics.","Leal Filho, Walter; Wall, Tony; Rayman-Bacchus, Lez; Mifsud, Mark; Pritchard, Diana J; Lovren, Violeta Orlovic; Farinha, Carla; Petrovic, Danijela S; Balogun, Abdul-Lateef",BMC Public Health,576,5

The molecule is completely flat and stabilized by an intramolecular O–H···O hydrogen bond, yielding a six-membered pseudo-aromatic ring. The aromaticity index of this pseudo-aromatic ring was found to be 0.748, while the same indix for the pyrazine ring in favipiravir was found to be 0.954. The crystal packing of favipiravir is mainly constructed through intermolecular N–H···O, N–H···N and C–H···O hydrogen bonds, yielding a 3D supramolecular framework with a zst topology defined by the point symbol of (65·8). The crystal structure of favipiravir is further stabilized by weak C–F···F–C intermolecular type II dihalogen interactions, yielding a 1D supramolecular polymeric chain. More than 80% of the total Hirshfeld surface area for favipiravir is occupied by H···H/C/N/O/F and C···N/O contacts. Energy frameworks have been calculated to additionally analyze the overall crystal packing. It was established that the structure of favipiravir is mainly characterized by the dispersion energy framework followed by the less significant electrostatic energy framework contribution. Finally, by using density functional theory (DFT) calculations and the quantum theory of atoms in molecules, we have assigned the interaction energy of each hydrogen bond, which can be helpful to develop scoring functions to be used in force fields/docking calculations.

The LUS report was drafted using a score from 0 to 3 with 0 corresponding to A pattern, 1 corresponding to well separated vertical artifacts (B lines), 2 corresponding to white lung and small consolidations, 3 corresponding to wide consolidations. The total score results from the sum of the scores for each area. The primary outcome was endotracheal intubation, no active further management, or death. The secondary outcome was discharge from the emergency room (ER). RESULTS: 255 patients were enrolled. 93.7â% had a positive LUS.âETI was performed in 43 patients, and 24 received a DNI order. The general mortality rate was 15.7â%. Male sex (OR 3.04, pâ=â0.014), cardiovascular disease and hypertension (OR 2.75, pâ=â0.006), P/F (OR 0.99, pâ<â0.001) and an LUS score >â20 (OR 2.52, pâ=â0.046) were independent risk factors associated with the primary outcome. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis for an LUS score >â20 was performed with an AUC of 0.837. Independent risk factors associated with the secondary outcome were age (OR 0.96, pâ=â0.073), BMI (OR 0.87, pâ=â0,13), P/F (OR 1.03, pâ<â0.001), and LUS score <â10 (OR 20.9, pâ=â0.006). ROC curve analysis was performed using an LUS score <â10 with an AUC 0.967. CONCLUSION: The extent of lung abnormalities evaluated by LUS score is a predictor of a worse outcome, ETI, or death. Moreover, the LUS score could be an additional tool for the safe discharge of patient from the ER.","Tombini, Valeria; Di Capua, Mirko; Capsoni, Nicolò; Lazzati, Andrea; Bergamaschi, Marta; Gheda, Silvia; Ghezzi, Leonardo; Cassano, Giulio; Albertini, Valentina; Porta, Lorenzo; Zacchino, Massimo; Campanella, Carlo; Guarnieri, Linda; Cazzola, Katia Barbara; Velati, Marta; Di Domenico, Sandro Luigi; Tonani, Michela; Spina, Maria Teresa; Paglia, Stefano; Bellone, Andrea",Ultraschall med,576,1

METHODS: 50 adult cadavers were studied. RESULTS: in 47 cases (94%), the cysticohepatic junction ocurred near the hepatic hilum. In 3 cases (6%), the junction between cystic duct and common hepatic duct ocurred at the level of the hepatopancreatic ampulla (Vater's ampulla). The angle formed by the junction of the cystic duct with the common hepatic duct was less than 30º in 72,4% of the cases. In 23,0%, this angle was between 30 and 45º. In 21,3% was between 45 and 60º. In 2,3% of the cases it was greater than 60º. The common hepatic duct recieved the cystic duct on its right side in the majority of the cases (59,6%); anteriorly in 17% of the cases; posteriorly in 12,8% and on the left side in 10,6% of the cases. In relation to the cystichepatic triangle components the cystic artery was present in 56% of the cases; the portal vein in 36%; the right hepatic artery in 34%; the left hepatic artery in 2% and the proper hepatic artery in 2% of the cases. The dimensions of the cystic duct were 2,53±1,19cm of length and 0,29±0,12cm of diameter. The spiral fold (Heister's valve) was observed in 80% of the cases. The infundibulum of the gallbladder (Hartmann's pouch) was present in 74% of the cases. This knowledge contribute to the practice of video-assisted laparoscopy in this region. CONCLUSION: in cystichepatic triangle the cystic artery was found most frequently.","Sales Cavalcanti, Jennecy; de Lucena Oliveira, Eveline; Patricia Ferreira Santos, Laura; Tenório A.

Early prediction of survival of hospitalized patients will help the clinical management of COVID-19, but such a prediction model which is reliable and valid is still lacking. METHODS: We retrospectively enrolled 628 confirmed cases of COVID-19 using positive RT-PCR tests for SARS-CoV-2 in Tongji Hospital in Wuhan, China. These patients were randomly grouped into a training cohort (60%) and a validation cohort (40%). In the training cohort, least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression analysis and multivariate Cox regression analysis were utilized to identify prognostic factors for in-hospital survival of patients with COVID-19. A nomogram based on the three variables was built for clinical use. Areas under the ROC curves (AUC), concordance index (C-index) and calibration curve were used to evaluate the efficiency of the nomogram in both the training and validation cohorts. RESULTS: Hypertension, higher neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio and increased NT-proBNP value were found to be significantly associated with poorer prognosis in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. The three predictors were further used to build a prediction nomogram. The C-index of the nomogram in the training and validation cohorts was 0.901 and 0.892, respectively. The AUC in the training cohort was 0.922 for 14- day and 0.919 for 21-day probability of in-hospital survival, while in the validation cohort was 0.922 and 0.881, respectively. Moreover, the calibration curve for 14- day and 21-day survival also showed high coherence between the predicted and actual probability of survival. CONCLUSION: We managed to build a predictive model and constructed a nomogram for predicting in-hospital survival of patients with COVID-19. This model represents good performance and might be utilized clinically in the management of COVID-19.","Dong, Yi-Min; Sun, Jia; Li, Yi-Xin; Chen, Qian; Liu, Qing-Quan; Sun, Zhou; Pang, Ran; Chen, Fei; Xu, Bing-Yang; Manyande, Anne; Clark, Taane G; Li, Jin-Ping; Orhan, Ilkay Erdogan; Tian, Yu-Ke; Wang, Tao; Wu, Wei; Ye, Da-Wei",Clin. infect. dis,576,24

From the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, we noticed an unusual number of graft arterial anomalies following kidney transplant (KTx) in children. Nine children received a KTx at our center between February and July 2020, eight boys and one girl, of median age of 10 years. Seven presented Doppler features suggesting arterial stenosis, with an unusual extensive pattern. For comparison, over the previous 5-year period, persistent spectral Doppler arterial anomalies (focal anastomotic stenoses) following KTx were seen in 5% of children at our center. We retrospectively evidenced severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection in five of seven children with arterial stenosis. The remaining two patients had received a graft from a deceased adolescent donor with a positive serology at D0. These data led us to suspect immune postviral graft vasculitis, triggered by SARS-CoV-2. Because the diagnosis of COVID-19 is challenging in children, we recommend pretransplant monitoring of graft recipients and their parents by monthly RT-PCR and serology. We suggest balancing the risk of postviral graft vasculitis against the risk of prolonged dialysis when considering transplantation in a child during the pandemic.","Berteloot, Laureline; Berthaud, Romain; Temmam, Sarah; Lozach, Cécile; Zanelli, Elisa; Blanc, Thomas; Heloury, Yves; Capito, Carmen; Chardot, Christophe; Sarnacki, Sabine; Garcelon, Nicolas; Lacaille, Florence; Charbit, Marina; Pastural, Myriam; Rabant, Marion; Boddaert, Nathalie; Leruez-Ville, Marianne; Eloit, Marc; Sermet-Gaudelus, Isabelle; Dehoux, Laurène; Boyer, Olivia",Am. j. transplant,576,21

Frequency of COVID-19 and impact of lockdown on treatment compliance in patients with vasculitis are largely unknown. PATIENTS AND METHOD: Patients with ANCA-associated and large vessel vasculitis that have been followed-up in our clinic were contacted by phone and a questionnaire containing home isolation status, treatment adherence and history of COVID-19 between March 1st and June 30th, 2020 was applied. RESULTS: The survey was applied to 103 patients (F/M: 59/44, mean age: 53.2±12.5). Thirty-three (32%) patients didn?t attend at least one appointment; 98(95.1%) noted that they spent 3 months in home isolation. Five patients (4.8%) received immunosuppressives irregularly and 3(2.9%) developed symptoms due to undertreatment. Four (3.9%) patients admitted to hospital with a suspicion of COVID-19, but none of them had positive PCR or suggestive findings by imaging. COVID-19 diagnosed in a patient with granulomatosis with polyangiitis during hospitalization for disease flare and she died despite treatment. DISCUSSION: Frequency of COVID-19 was low in patients with vasculitis in our single center cohort during the first months of pandemic. Although outpatient appointments were postponed in one-third of our patients, high compliance with treatment and isolation rules ensured patients with vasculitis overcome this period with minimal morbidity and mortality.","Ince, Burak; Bektas, Murat; Koca, Nevzat; Agargün, Besim Fazil; Zarali, Sibel; Güzey, Damla Yenersu; Ince, Ayse; Sevdi, Mehmet Salih; Yalçinkaya, Yasemin; Artim Esen, Bahar; Gül, Ahmet; Öçal, Mahdume Lale; Inanç, Murat",Turkish journal of medical sciences,576,16

It has a double objective: To analyse the profile of the professional who teleworked in social services and, on the other hand, to analyse the perception of teleworkers of working conditions during this period, as well as the degree to which they have been affected by them depending on whether they work face-to-face or telematically. To this end, a questionnaire was administered to Spanish social service professionals working, obtaining a sample of 560 professionals in the sector. The profile obtained in relation to teleworking may be especially useful when considering the progressive incorporation of more non-presential activity in social services, and the results show that, although teleworking has been perceived as an efficient way of overcoming the limitations to face-to-face work arising from the pandemic, both the positive and negative consequences of the implementation of this modality of work should be carefully assessed.","Morilla-Luchena, Aleix; Muñoz-Moreno, Rocío; Chaves-Montero, Alfonso; Vázquez-Aguado, Octavio",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),576,16

The protein targets used in this study were: SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, furin and transmembrane serine protease 2. The results showed that the constituents of pomegranate peel extracts, namely punicalagin and punicalin had very promising potential for significant interactions with the selected protein targets and were therefore deemed good candidates for further in vitro and in vivo evaluation.","Surucic, Relja; Tubic, Biljana; Stojiljkovic, Milos P; Djuric, Dragan M; Travar, Maja; Grabez, Milkica; Savikin, Katarina; Skrbic, Ranko",Mol. cell. biochem,576,24

Evidence shows that up to a fifth of the patients develop fibrotic tissue in the lung. The SARS outbreak in the early 2000 resulted in chronic pulmonary fibrosis in a subset (around 4%) of the patients, and correlated to reduced lung function and forced expiratory volume (FEV). The similarities between corona virus infections causing SARS and Covid-19 are striking, except that the novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, has proven to have an even higher communicability. This would translate into a large number of patients seeking care for clinical signs of pulmonary fibrosis, given that the Covid-19 pandemic has up till now (Sept 2020) affected around 30 million people. The SARS-CoV-2 is dependent on binding to the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is part of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS). Downregulation of ACE2 upon virus binding disturbs downstream activities of RAS resulting in increased inflammation and development of fibrosis. The poor prognosis and risk of developing pulmonary fibrosis are therefore associated with the increased expression of ACE2 in risk groups, such as obesity, heart disorders and aging, conferring plenty of binding opportunity for the virus and subsequently the internalization of ACE2, thus devoiding the enzyme from acting counter-inflammatory and antifibrotic. Identifying pathways that are associated with Covid-19 severity that result in pulmonary fibrosis may enable early diagnosis and individualized treatment for these patients to prevent or reduce irreversible fibrotic damage to the lung.","Wigén, Jenny; Löfdahl, Anna; Bjermer, Leif; Elowsson-Rendin, Linda; Westergren-Thorsson, Gunilla",Respir Med X,576,20

However, the pandemic appears to be less severe in highly dengue endemic countries. In this connection, several studies reported that sero-diagnostic tests for DV yielded considerable false-positive results for SARS-CoV-2 and vice versa in dengue endemic regions, thereby indicating towards potential cross-reactivity between these two viruses. We anticipated that SARS-CoV-2 and DV might share antigenic similarity and performed computational docking studies to test this hypothesis. Our results predicted with high confidence that human DV antibodies can indeed, bind to RBD of SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein. Some of these interactions can also potentially intercept human ACE2 receptor binding to RBM. Dengue serum samples predating the COVID-19, had been found to cross-react with SARS-CoV-2 Spike and this provides direct experimental validation of our predictions. Our analysis also showed that m396 and 80R antibodies (against SARS-CoV-1) did not dock with RBM of SARS-CoV-2, a fact already proven experimentally. This confirmed reliability and robustness of our approach. So, it is highly probable that immunological memory/antibodies to DV in endemic countries may reduce the severity and spread of COVID-19. It is not known whether SARS-CoV-2 antibodies will hinder DV infections by binding to DV particles and reduce dengue incidences in the future or, augment DV infection and severity by deploying antibody-dependent enhancement.","Nath, Himadri; Mallick, Abinash; Roy, Subrata; Sukla, Soumi; Biswas, Subhajit",,576,16

The stability of the BBB structure and function is of great significance for the maintenance of brain homeostasis. When a neurotropic virus invades the CNS via a hematogenous or non-hematogenous route, it may cause structural and functional disorders of the BBB, and also activate the BBB anti-inflammatory or pro-inflammatory innate immune response. This article focuses on the structural and functional changes that occur in the three main components of the BBB (endothelial cells, astrocytes, and pericytes) in response to infection with neurotropic viruses transmitted by hematogenous routes, and also briefly describes the supportive effect of three cells on the BBB under normal physiological conditions. For example, all three types of cells express several PRRs, which can quickly sense the virus and make corresponding immune responses. The pro-inflammatory immune response will exacerbate the destruction of the BBB, while the anti-inflammatory immune response, based on type I IFN, consolidates the stability of the BBB. Exploring the details of the interaction between the host and the pathogen at the BBB during neurotropic virus infection will help to propose new treatments for viral encephalitis. Enhancing the defense function of the BBB, maintaining the integrity of the BBB, and suppressing the pro-inflammatory immune response of the BBB provide more ideas for limiting the neuroinvasion of neurotropic viruses. In the future, these new treatments are expected to cooperate with traditional antiviral methods to improve the therapeutic effect of viral encephalitis.","Chen, Zhuangzhuang; Li, Guozhong",Innate Immun,576,20

However, it is often overlooked that most legislative bills are derived, or even directly copied, from other bills. Despite the significance of bill-to-bill linkages for understanding the legislative process, existing approaches fail to address semantic similarities across bills, let alone reordering or paraphrasing which are prevalent in legal document writing. In this paper, we overcome these limitations by proposing a 5-class classification task that closely reflects the nature of the bill generation process. In doing so, we construct a human-labeled dataset of 4,721 bill-to-bill relationships at the subsection-level and release this annotated dataset to the research community. To augment the dataset, we generate synthetic data with varying degrees of similarity, mimicking the complex bill writing process. We use BERT variants and apply multi-stage training, sequentially fine-tuning our models with synthetic and human-labeled datasets. We find that the predictive performance significantly improves when training with both human-labeled and synthetic data. Finally, we apply our trained model to infer section- and bill-level similarities. Our analysis shows that the proposed methodology successfully captures the similarities across legal documents at various levels of aggregation.","Kim, Jiseon; Griggs, Elden; Kim, In Song; Oh, Alice",,576,29

METHODS: Three N95 masks of different makes (A, B and C) were subjected to six decontamination methods: ultraviolet (UV) irradiation, isopropyl alcohol (IPA) dip, plasma sterilization (Sterrad®), ethylene oxide (ETO, 3M®), dry heat sterilization, and moist heat sterilization (autoclaving). The integrity of the N95 masks was assessed by measuring their particle filtering efficiency at particle sizes ranging 0.3-0.5 microns. RESULTS: All the masks decontaminated with ETO and plasma sterilization retained over 95% particle filtering efficiency. Masks decontaminated using IPA dip and autoclaving showed a drop, and UV irradiation showed variations in particle size efficiency degradation after decontamination. CONCLUSIONS: Plasma sterilization is recommended for decontamination of N95 masks in low-resource settings. ETO is not recommended due to hazards associated with handling of ethylene oxide, although the filtering efficiency was retained. Since the UV irradiation method showed variations in results, evaluation of UV decontamination for N95 masks needs to be performed on a case-by-case basis.","Rohit, Anusha; Rajasekaran, Shankar; Shenoy, Suchitra; Rai, Sumit; Iddya, Karunasagar; Dorairajan, Suresh Kumar",Int J Infect Dis,576,14

Factors independently associated with vaccine hesitancy (a response of ""no"" or ""not sure"") included younger age, Black race, lower educational attainment, and not having received the influenza vaccine in the prior year. Reasons for vaccine hesitancy included vaccine-specific concerns, a need for more information, antivaccine attitudes or beliefs, and a lack of trust. LIMITATIONS: Participants' intent to be vaccinated was explored before a vaccine was available and when the pandemic was affecting a narrower swath of the United States. Questions about specific information or factors that might increase vaccination acceptance were not included. The survey response rate was 16.1%. CONCLUSION: This national survey, conducted during the coronavirus pandemic, revealed that approximately 3 in 10 adults were not sure they would accept vaccination and 1 in 10 did not intend to be vaccinated against COVID-19. Targeted and multipronged efforts will be needed to increase acceptance of a COVID-19 vaccine when one becomes available.

Postmortem lungs were sampled and studied from these autopsies, with a special focus on several corresponding sites based on imaging features.The predominant pattern of pulmonary injury in these 9 cases was diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) and interstitial inflammation. Moreover, acute fibrinous exudates, organization, inflammatory cell infiltration, hyaline membranes, pulmonary edema, pneumocyte hyperplasia, and fibrosis were all observed. The histopathology features varied according to the site and severity of each lesion. In most of the 9 cases, opacities started from a subpleural area and peripheral structures were more severely damaged based on gross views and pathological examinations. Fibrosis could occur in early stages of infection and this was supported by radiological and pathological findings. The radiological features of COVID-19 pneumonia, at the critically ill stage, were diffuse ground-glass opacities with consolidation, interstitial thickening, and fibrous stripes, which was based in the fibrous tissue proliferation in the alveolar and interlobular septa, and filled alveoli with organizing exudation. Fungal and bacterial co-infections were also observed in 6 cases.Typical imaging features can be correlated with underlying pathological findings. Combining assessments of imaging features with pathological findings therefore can enhance our understanding of the histopathological mechanism of COVID-19 pneumonia, and facilitate early radiological diagnosis and prognosis estimation of COVID-19 pneumonia, which has important implications for the development of clinical targeted treatments and research related to COVID-19 pneumonia.","Zhao, Lingyun; Wang, Xi; Xiong, Ying; Fan, Yanqing; Zhou, Yiwu; Zhu, Wenzhen",Medicine (Baltimore),576,26

This research aims to analyse the planning and health workforce policies in Germany, a country with a largely decentralised workforce governance mechanism. METHODS: Systematic search between 18 and 31 May 2020 at federal and 16 states on health workforce action and planning (websites of ministries of health, public health authorities), including pandemic preparedness plans and policies. The search followed World Health Organisation (WHO) Europe's health workforce guidance on Covid-19. Content analysis was performed, informed by the themes of WHO. RESULTS: The pandemic preparedness plans consisted of no or limited information on how to expand and prepare the health workforce during pandemics. The 16 states varied considerably regarding implementing strategies to expand health workforce capacities. Only one state adopted a policy on task-shifting despite a federal law on task-shifting during pandemics. CONCLUSIONS: Planning on the health workforce, its capacity and skill-mix during pandemics was limited in the pandemic response plans. Actions during the peak of the pandemic varied considerably across states, were implemented ad hoc and with limited planning. Future action should focus on integrated planning and evaluation of workforce policies.","Köppen, Julia; Hartl, Kimberly; Maier, Claudia B",Int J Health Plann Manage,576,5

One of the critical enzymes in the utilization of glutamine in these cells is glutaminase. CB-839 (telaglenastat) is a drug that targets glutaminase that is currently being evaluated in many clinical trials for efficacy in various cancer types that are known to be driven by glutamine metabolism. Despite its use, there are limited assays available for testing the pharmacodynamic on-target effects of CB-839 on the limited, small-volume patient samples that are obtained in early-phase clinical trials. Thus, we developed an assay based on the cellular thermal shift assay technique using AlphaLISA technology to show that CB-839 specifically engages glutaminase in colon cancer cell lines in vitro and in minute quantities of mouse xenograft tumors. Notably, we show that this assay detects CB-839 binding to glutaminase in platelets of patients collected while receiving CB-839 on a clinical trial. This assay may be used to study the pharmacodynamic profile of CB-839 in very small tissue samples obtained from patients on a clinical trial and may be useful in future studies designed to screen other inhibitors of glutaminase.","Chen, Yicheng; Zhao, Yiqing; Bajor, David L; Wang, Zhenghe; Selfridge, J Eva",J. genet. genomics,576,16

Acetylation of several proteins plays essential roles in various biological processes, such as viral infections. We reported that the nucleoproteins of influenza virus and Zaire Ebolavirus were acetylated, suggesting that these modifications contributed to the molecular events involved in viral replication. Similar to influenza virus and Ebolavirus, the coronavirus also contains single-stranded RNA, as its viral genome interacts with the nucleocapsid (N) proteins. In this study, we report that SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 N proteins are strongly acetylated by human histone acetyltransferases, P300/CBP-associated factor (PCAF), and general control nonderepressible 5 (GCN5), but not by CREB-binding protein (CBP) in vitro. Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry analyses identified 2 and 12 acetyl-lysine residues from SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 N proteins, respectively. Particularly in the SARS-CoV-2 N proteins, the acetyl-lysine residues were localized in or close to several functional sites, such as the RNA interaction domains and the M-protein interacting site. These results suggest that acetylation of SARS-CoV-2 N proteins plays crucial roles in their functions.","Hatakeyama, Dai; Masuda, Takeshi; Miki, Ryosuke; Ohtsuki, Sumio; Kuzuhara, Takashi",Biochem Biophys Res Commun,576,12

The paper proposes a novel deep neural network framework to forecast the COVID-19 outbreak. The COVID-19Net framework combined 1D convolutional neural network, 2D convolutional neural network, and bidirectional gated recurrent units. COVID-19Net can well integrate the characteristics of time, space, and influencing factors of the COVID-19 accumulative cases. Three European countries with severe outbreaks were studied—Germany, Italy, and Spain—to extract spatiotemporal features and predict the number of confirmed cases. The prediction results acquired from COVID-19Net are compared to those obtained using a CNN, GRU, and CNN-GRU. The mean absolute error, mean absolute percentage error, and root mean square error, which is commonly used model assessment indices, were used to compare the accuracy of the models. The results verified that COVID-19Net was notably more accurate than the other models. The mean absolute percentage error generated by COVID-19Net was 1.447 for Germany, 1.801 for Italy, and 2.828 for Spain, which was considerably better than those of the other models. This indicated that the proposed framework could accurately predict the accumulated number of confirmed cases in the three countries and serve as an essential reference for devising public health strategies. And also indicated that COVID-19 has high spatiotemporal relations, it suggests us to keep a social distance and avoid unnecessary trips.","Huang, Chiou-Jye; Shen, Yamin; Kuo, Ping-Huan; Chen, Yung-Hsiang",Socioecon Plann Sci,576,1

However, prior studies illustrated that healthcare workers frequently err during application and removal of PPE. The goal of this study was to determine whether a simulation-based, mastery learning intervention with deliberate practice improves correct use of PPE by physicians during a simulated clinical encounter with a COVID-19 patient. METHODS: This was a pretest-posttest study performed in the emergency department at a large, academic tertiary care hospital between March 31–April 8, 2020. A total of 117 subjects participated, including 56 faculty members and 61 resident physicians. Prior to the intervention, all participants received institution-mandated education on PPE use via an online video and supplemental materials. Participants completed a pretest skills assessment using a 21-item checklist of steps to correctly don and doff PPE. Participants were expected to meet a minimum passing score (MPS) of 100%, determined by an expert panel using the Mastery Angoff and Patient Safety standard-setting techniques. Participants that met the MPS on pretest were exempt from the educational intervention. Testing occurred before and after an in-person demonstration of proper donning and doffing techniques and 20 minutes of deliberate practice. The primary outcome was a change in assessment scores of correct PPE use following our educational intervention. Secondary outcomes included differences in performance scores between faculty members and resident physicians, and differences in performance during donning vs doffing sequences. RESULTS: All participants had a mean pretest score of 73.1% (95% confidence interval [CI], 70.9–75.3%). Faculty member and resident pretest scores were similar (75.1% vs 71.3%, p = 0.082). Mean pretest doffing scores were lower than donning scores across all participants (65.8% vs 82.8%, p<0.001). Participant scores increased 26.9% (95% CI of the difference 24.7–29.1%, p<0.001) following our educational intervention resulting in all participants meeting the MPS of 100%. CONCLUSION: A mastery learning intervention with deliberate practice ensured the correct use of PPE by physician subjects in a simulated clinical encounter of a COVID-19 patient.

These include pre-endoscopic questionnaire-based risk-stratification as well as pre-procedure viral testing. Real-life data on the effectiveness of these measures are presented here. Patients and methods Data from the outpatient endoscopic unit of the University Hospital Augsburg between July 1, 2020 and December 31, 2020 including the second pandemic wave were reviewed retrospectively. All patients were assessed with a pre-endoscopic risk-stratification questionnaire as well as viral testing using an antigen point-of-care test (Ag-POCT) in conjunction with a standard polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test. Highly elective procedures were postponed. The theoretically expected number of SARS-CoV-2-positive patients was simulated and compared with the actual number. In addition, endoscopy staff was evaluated with a rapid antibody test to determine the number of infections among the personnel. Results In total, 1029 procedures, 591 questionnaires, 591 Ag-POCTs, and 529 standard PCR tests were performed in 591 patients. 247 procedures in 142 patients were postponed. One Ag-POCT was positive but with a negative PCR test, while one PCR test was positive but with a negative Ag-POCT. This was lower than the theoretically expected number of COVID-19-positive patients (n = 15). One of 43 employees (2.3 %) in the outpatient endoscopy unit was seropositive. Conclusions Pre-endoscopic risk management including questionnaire-based risk stratification and viral testing seems to be an effective tool in combination with personal protective equipment for SARS-CoV-2 infection prevention and control within the endoscopy unit even in a high-prevalence setting.","Zellmer, Stephan; Ebigbo, Alanna; Kahn, Maria; Muzalyova, Anna; Classen, Johanna; Grünherz, Vivian; Temizel, Selin; Dhillon, Christine; Messmann, Helmut; Römmele, Christoph",Endosc Int Open,576,26

Influenza A virus, hepatitis C virus, and several other pathogenic viruses are mainly recognized by RIG-I, resulting in the activation of the innate immune responses. The protein comprises N-terminal two caspase activation and recruitment domains (2CARDs), an RNA helicase domain, and the C-terminal domain (CTD). The CTD recognizes 5′-triphosphate viral dsRNA. After recognition of viral dsRNA, the protein harbors K63-linked polyubiquitination essential for RIG-I activation. First, it was reported that TRIM25 ubiquitin ligase delivered K63-linked polyubiquitin moiety to the 2CARDs. The polyubiquitin chain stabilizes a structure called the 2CARD tetramer, in which four 2CARDs assemble and make a core that promotes the aggregation of the mitochondrial antiviral-signaling (MAVS) protein on mitochondria. MAVS aggregation then triggers the signal to induce the innate immune responses. However, subsequent studies have reported that Riplet, MEX3C, and TRIM4 ubiquitin ligases are also involved in K63-linked polyubiquitination and the activation of RIG-I. MEX3C and TRIM4 mediate polyubiquitination of the 2CARDs. By contrast, Riplet ubiquitinates the CTD. The physiological significance of each ubiquitin ligases has been shown by knockout and knockdown studies, but there appears to be contradictory to evidence reported in the literature. In this review, we summarize recent findings related to K63-linked polyubiquitination and propose a model that could reconcile current contradictory theories. We also discuss the physiological significance of the ubiquitin ligases in the immune system against viral infection.","Okamoto, Masaaki; Kouwaki, Takahisa; Fukushima, Yoshimi; Oshiumi, Hiroyuki",Front Immunol,576,22

METHODS: We conducted a nationwide online survey, which consisted of sociodemographic and job-related items, questions on pain and analgesics intake and the short-version of the validated Depression–Anxiety–Stress Scale (DASS-21). RESULTS: A total of 774 EMS personnel with a mean age of 33.03 (standard error [SE] 0.37) years were included into the final analysis of which 23.77% were female. Pain was reported by 58.64% (454 of 774) of the study participants with 10.72% (95% confidence interval [CI] 8.54%; 13.29%) suffering from chronic, 1.68% (95% CI 0.89%; 2.87%) from acute and 46.25% (95% CI 41.49%; 51.30%) from recurrent pain, respectively. Most frequent location of pain was lumbar spine. Analgesics were used by 52.76% (239 of 454) of pre-hospital EMS personnel with pain (acute 76.92% / chronic 69.88% / recurrent 47.90%). Moreover, participants with chronic and recurrent pain indicated significantly higher depression (p ≤ 0.001), anxiety (p ≤ 0.001), and stress (p ≤ 0.001) levels compared to those without pain, respectively. CONCLUSION: This study indicates a high prevalence of pain and analgesics usage in participating German pre-hospital EMS personnel and a poorer mental health in those with chronic and recurrent pain. Therefore, disease prevention and health promotion measures are needed to preserve health of pre-hospital EMS personnel.","Möckel, Luis; Gerhard, Angela; Mohr, Mara; Armbrust, Christoph Immanuel; Möckel, Christina",Int Arch Occup Environ Health,576,1

We discuss the theoretical framework that guided the project and led to a focus on family, friend, and neighbor (FFN) child care providers. We also present three examples of solutions that were uniquely shaped to meet the needs of FFN child care providers in Flint. Each solution was developed by a process that included taking the perspective of the people who faced the problem, spending time to understand the context of the problem, and uncovering the underlying problem which was not apparent at first.

This study was a multicenter, population-based national retrospective-cohort investigation of 28,759 adults with mild COVID-19 seen at the network of Comprehensive Healthcare Centers (CHC) between March and September 2020 throughout Iran. The baseline characteristics and outcome variables were extracted from the national integrated health system database. A total of 7,295 (25.37%) patients who presented with mild COVID-19 within 3 to 7 days of symptoms onset received HCQ (400 mg twice daily on day 1 followed by 200 mg twice daily for the next four days and were then followed for 14 days).

Due to their novelty, pharmacokinetic DOAC drug-drug interactions (DDIs) that result in clinical adverse events have not been well-documented. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to systematically review reported pharmacokinetic DDIs resulting in clinical adverse events through documented observational evidence to better inform clinicians in clinical practice. METHODS: A comprehensive literature review of EMBASE, MEDLINE, and Ovid HealthStar was conducted through March 10th, 2020. Two independent reviewers screened and extracted data from eligible articles according to pre-established inclusion and exclusion criteria. Articles reporting bleeding or thrombotic outcomes in non-controlled (observational) settings resulting from suggested pharmacokinetic DOAC DDIs were included. RESULTS: A total of 5567 citations were reviewed, of which 24 were included following data extraction. The majority were case reports (n = 21) documenting a single adverse event resulting from a suspected DOAC DDI, while the remaining papers were a case series (n = 1) and cohort studies (n = 2). The most commonly reported interacting drugs were amiodarone and ritonavir (bleeding), and phenobarbital, phenytoin, and carbamazepine (thrombosis). Bleeding events more often resulted from a combined mechanism (P-glycoprotein AND CYP3A4 inhibition), whereas thrombotic events resulted from either combined OR single P-glycoprotein/CYP3A4 induction. CONCLUSION: Current literature evaluating the real-world risk of DOAC DDIs is limited to few case reports and retrospective observational analyses. Clinicians are encouraged to continue to report suspected drug interactions resulting in adverse events.","Li, Allen; Li, Ming K.; Crowther, Mark; Vazquez, Sara R.",Thromb Res,576,20

We modelled the impact of different prioritisation choices and dose intervals on infections, hospitalisations, mortality, and public health restrictions. An agent-based model was built to quantify the impact of different vaccination strategies over 6 months. Input parameters were derived from published phase 3 trials and official European figures. We explored the effect of prioritising vulnerable people, care-home staff and residents, versus contagious groups; and the impact of dose intervals ranging from 3 to 12 weeks. Prioritising vulnerable people, rather than the most contagious, led to higher numbers of COVID-19 infections, whilst reducing mortality, hospital admissions, and public health restrictions. At a realistic vaccination speed of ≤ 0·1% population/day, separating doses by 12 weeks (vs a baseline scenario of 3 weeks) reduced hospitalisations, mortality, and restrictions for vaccines with similar first- and second-dose efficacy (e.g., the Oxford-AstraZeneca and Moderna vaccines), but not for those with lower first vs second-dose efficacy (e.g., the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine). Mass vaccination will dramatically reduce the effect of COVID-19 on Europe’s health and economy. Early vaccination of vulnerable populations will reduce mortality, hospitalisations, and public health restrictions compared to prioritisation of the most contagious people. The choice of interval between doses should be based on expected vaccine availability and first-dose efficacy, with 12-week intervals preferred over shorter intervals in most realistic scenarios.","Català, Martí; Li, Xintong; Prats, Clara; Prieto-Alhambra, Daniel",Sci Rep,576,16

This study aimed at reporting practical workflow, identification of high-risk or suspected cases of CO­VID-19, and subsequent response measures. METHODS: At the time of the COVID-19 outbreak, precautions and practice protocols were applied in our dialysis units (DUs). This single-center study retrospectively reviewed all high-risk/suspected cases from January 23, 2020, to February 10, 2020. Epidemiological, clinical feature, and detailed data on all cases were recorded. RESULTS: Practical workflow for the clinical management of dialysis patients, caregivers, and HCP was initiated. A total of 6 high-risk/suspected cases were identified. Female gender, older age, presence of cardiovascular disease, diabetes, anuresis, immunocompromised status, hypoalbuminemia, and underweight were noticeable features in these cases. Direct evidence of infection or epidemiological risk was detected in five cases. Close monitoring for temperature and oxygen saturation during hemodialysis sessions may be reasonable. No confirmed COVID-19 cases were reported in our DU, but certain cases showed rapid deterioration due to other critically severe condition needing hospitalization. Portable dialysis machines are of great need to ensure dialysis care provision. CONCLUSIONS: Our study described a practical workflow for patient-centered management during COVID-19 outbreak. Potential risk factors and underlying clinical patterns were reported. Further studies regarding the efficacy of infection control precautions and practice protocols tailored for dialysis settings are warranted.","Hu, Shou-Ci; Fu, En-Qing; Fan, Jun-Fen; Ye, Qing-Qing; Xia, Cong; Gan, Tie-Er; Ma, Hong-Zhen",Blood Purif,576,7

The percentage of tests that return a positive result is a metric currently used both as a benchmark of testing adequacy and for assessing the viral spread. However, since the former is a prerequisite for the latter, the interpretation is often conflicting, especially during times of testing scaling-up, or during phases of increasing viral spread. We propose as a benchmark for COVID-19 testing effectiveness a simple metric that creates a link between the cases detected and tests performed, with specific observable outcomes that are actively being monitored in most countries, such as the number of new Intensive Care Unit (ICU) admissions and the number of deaths in the community. This new metric, named ""Severity Detection Rate"", or SDR, represents the current number of daily needs for new ICU admissions, per 100 cases detected (t-i) days ago, per 10,000 tests performed (t-i) days ago. Based on the announced COVID-19 monitoring data in Greece from May 2020 until end of January 2021, we show that beyond a threshold of daily testing number, SDR reaches a plateau of weak variability that begins to reflect testing adequacy. Because of this stabilization, it was possible to predict with great accuracy the daily needs for new ICU admissions, 12 days ahead of each testing data point, over a period of 6 months that included the second wave of the pandemic in the country, with Pearson r = 0.99 (p = 10^-180), RMSE = 4,34.

After a history of fever for 7 days, abdominal pain, vomiting and dry cough resistant to treatment with oral antibiotics, he was admitted to hospital. The clinical examination showed a slightly red throat, a tense abdomen and erythema. The blood tests revealed leukocytosis and significantly increased inflammatory parameters. The abdominal ultrasound showed thickened intestinal loops in the left lower abdomen and the echocardiography showed minimal mitral regurgitation, a narrow pericardial effusion lamella over both ventricles and normal coronary arteries. Accordingly, cardiac enzymes were elevated. The day after admission, the boy developed an increasing rash and was transferred to the PICU because of septic shock refractory to high volume resuscitation, requiring hemodynamic support with noradrenaline and noninvasive respiratory assistance. The initial testing for SARS-CoV‑2 on nasopharyngeal aspirates was negative twice; however, serum IgG antibodies were positive. Other viral and bacterial infections were excluded as the cause of the symptoms. The patient received IVIG, ASS, furosemide and methylprednisolone and the antibiotic treatment was continued. The dosage of the catecholamine could be reduced according to the patient’s condition and the serially performed echocardiographic findings. The patient recovered in his general condition and was discharged from the PICU after 8 days. With the help of a detailed family history, we were able to figure out that the whole family, including the patient himself, had symptoms of a cold about 1 month earlier. Hence, SARS-CoV‑2 antibody tests carried out showed a positive result for all of them. Pediatric inflammatory multisystem syndrome (PIMS) can quickly lead to manifest shock symptoms, necessitating close monitoring.

Distribution of SARS-CoV-2 infection at Care Houses was uneven. As the virus circulation global rate was low in our area, the number of people at risk of acquiring the infection continues to be very high. In this work, we have successfully demonstrated that pooling of different groups of samples at low prevalence clusters, can be done with a small average delay on quantification cycle (Cq) values. A new surveillance system with guaranteed protection is required for small clusters, previously covered with individual testing. Our proposal for Care Houses, once prevalence zero is achieved, would include successive rounds of testing using a pooling solution for transmission control preserving testing resources.

Therefore, we began testing all patients with COVID‐19 for the N501Y and E484K mutations by using polymerase chain reaction (PCR)‐based methods. Nasopharyngeal swab samples from 108 patients who visited our hospital between February and April 2021 were analyzed. The samples were analyzed using reverse transcription‐PCR with melting curve analysis to detect the N501Y and E484K mutations. A part of the samples was also subjected to whole‐genome sequencing (WGS). Clinical parameters such as mortality and admission to the intensive care unit were analyzed to examine the association between increased disease severity and the E484K mutation. The ratio of cases showing the 501N + 484K mutation rapidly increased from 8% in February to 46% in March. WGS revealed that the viruses with 501N + 484K mutation are R.1 lineage variants. Evidence of increased disease severity related to the R.1 variants was not found. We found that the R.1 lineage variants rapidly prevailed in Tokyo in March 2021, which suggests the increased transmissibility of R.1 variants, while they showed no increased severity.","Nagano, Katsutoshi; Tani‐Sassa, Chihiro; Iwasaki, Yumi; Takatsuki, Yuna; Yuasa, Sonoka; Takahashi, Yuta; Nakajima, Jun; Sonobe, Kazunari; Ichimura, Naoya; Nukui, Yoko; Takeuchi, Hiroaki; Tanimoto, Kousuke; Tanaka, Yukie; Kimura, Akinori; Tohda, Shuji",J Med Virol,576,30

Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is the membrane-delimited receptor for SARS-CoV-2. Lung, intestine and kidney, major sites of viral infection, express ACE2 that harbours an intracellular, carboxy-terminal PDZ-recognition motif. These organs prominently express the PDZ protein Na+/H+ exchanger regulatory factor-1 (NHERF1). Here, we report NHERF1 tethers ACE2 and augments SARS-CoV-2 cell entry. ACE2 directly binds both NHERF1 PDZ domains. Disruption of either NHERF1 PDZ core-binding motif or the ACE2 PDZ-recognition sequence eliminates interaction. Proximity ligation assays establish that ACE2 and NHERF1 interact at constitutive expression levels in human lung and intestine cells. Ablating ACE2 interaction with NHERF1 accelerated SARS-CoV-2 cell entry. Conversely, elimination of the ACE2 C-terminal PDZ binding motif decreased ACE2 membrane residence and reduced pseudotyped virus entry. We conclude that the PDZ interaction of ACE2 with NHERF1 facilitates SARS-CoV-2 internalization. β-arrestin is likely indispensable, as with G protein-coupled receptors.","Zhang, Qiangmin; Gefter, Julia; Sneddon, W.

We investigated the risk of transmitting SARS-CoV-2 by droplets and aerosols during an experimental indoor mass gathering event under three different hygiene practices, and used the data in a simulation study to estimate the resulting burden of disease under conditions of controlled epidemics. Our results show that the mean number of measured direct contacts per visitor was nine persons and this can be reduced substantially by appropriate hygiene practices. A comparison of two versions of ventilation with different air exchange rates and different airflows found that the system which performed worst allowed a ten-fold increase in the number of individuals exposed to infectious aerosols. The overall burden of infections resulting from indoor mass gatherings depends largely on the quality of the ventilation system and the hygiene practices. Presuming an effective ventilation system, indoor mass gathering events with suitable hygiene practices have a very small, if any, effect on epidemic spread.","Moritz, Stefan; Gottschick, Cornelia; Horn, Johannes; Popp, Mario; Langer, Susan; Klee, Bianca; Purschke, Oliver; Gekle, Michael; Ihling, Angelika; Zimmermann, Frank D.

We studied the characteristics and outcome of children with non-SARS HCoV acute lower respiratory infection (ALRI). METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study from a tertiary care teaching hospital in eastern India. RESULTS: Of 137 samples tested positive for respiratory viruses, 13 were due to HCoV (7 boys, median age: 2 years). Cough was the most common symptom, followed by breathing difficulty and fever. An underlying comorbid condition present in 38.4%. Co-infection with other viruses was seen in 69% of cases. Chest radiograph was abnormal in 69.3% of children. Antibiotics were administered in 53.8%. The median length of hospitalization was 5 d, irrespective of underlying disease. There was no mortality. CONCLUSIONS: HCoV is an uncommon but increasingly recognized cause of ALRI in hospitalized children. No severe illness was found in children with underlying comorbidities. This study underscores the importance of HCoV in causation of childhood ALRI, necessitating a surveillance system in India.","Das, Rashmi Ranjan; Fajrudheen, Mohamed; Mohanty, Monalisa; John, Joseph; Rath, Sutapa; Satapathy, Amit Kumar; Dwibedi, Bhagirathi; Mishra, Baijayantimala",J Glob Infect Dis,576,21

This paper uses data from a sample survey of migrant workers to come up with useful parameters for estimating the potential losses from possible retrenchment of migrant workers due to the pandemic. The paper employs a simple estimation model using parameters derived from data collected from a KNOMAD-ILO survey of low-skilled migrant workers in the India–Saudi Arabia migration corridor, conducted during 2016–2017. An important finding is that the aggregate losses that low-skilled Indian workers in Saudi Arabia are likely to incur due to COVID-19-related retrenchment may be as high as 21% of their expected earnings. Adding recruitment costs can push up their losses to 36% of expected or potential earnings, while the aggregate remittances to their families could drop by USD 2 billion.","Abella, Manolo I.; Sasikumar, S.

We use a micro–macro approach to examine whether and to what extent barriers to accessing healthcare measured by reported unmet healthcare needs vary within and between countries. We consider various aspects of barriers and distinguish among: (1) respondents who forewent medical treatment because they were afraid of becoming infected with the Coronavirus; (2) respondents who had pre-scheduled medical appointments postponed by health providers due to the outbreak; and (3) respondents who tried to arrange a medical appointment but were denied one. Limited access to healthcare during the initial outbreak was more common for the occupationally active, women, the more educated and those living in urban areas. A bad economic situation, poor overall health and higher healthcare utilisation were robust predictors of unmet healthcare. People aged 50+ in countries of ‘Old’ Europe, countries with higher universal health coverage and stricter containment and closure policies were more likely to have medical services postponed. Policymakers should address the healthcare needs of older people with chronic health conditions and a poor socio-economic status who were made more vulnerable by this pandemic. In the aftermath of the health crisis, public health systems might experience a great revival in healthcare demand, a challenge that should be mitigated by careful planning and provision of healthcare services.","Smolić, Šime; Čipin, Ivan; Međimurec, Petra",Eur J Ageing,576,20

It regulates various cell processes, including protein targeting, transcriptional regulation, signal transduction, and cell division. To understand its role in the model lepidoptera insect Bombyx mori, a recombinant baculovirus was constructed to express an enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP)-SUMO fusion protein along with ubiquitin carrier protein 9 of Bombyx mori (BmUBC9). SUMOylation substrates from Bombyx mori cells infected with this baculovirus were isolated by immunoprecipitation and identified by LC–ESI-MS/MS. A total of 68 candidate SUMOylated proteins were identified, of which 59 proteins were functionally categorized to gene ontology (GO) terms. Analysis of kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes (KEGG) pathways showed that 46 of the identified proteins were involved in 76 pathways that mainly play a role in metabolism, spliceosome and ribosome functions, and in RNA transport. Furthermore, SUMOylation of four candidates (polyubiquitin-C-like isoform X1, 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase, cyclin-related protein FAM58A-like and GTP-binding nuclear protein Ran) were verified by co-immunoprecipitation in Drosophila schneide 2 cells. In addition, 74% of the identified proteins were predicted to have at least one SUMOylation site.

It may facilitate health care delivery while reducing unnecessary visits to the clinic. The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak has caused an abrupt change in our daily urological practice, converting many of us to be reliant on telehealth. OBJECTIVE: To provide practical recommendations for effective use of technological tools in telemedicine. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: A Medline-based and gray literature search was conducted through April 2020. We selected the most relevant articles related to “telemedicine” and “smart working” that could provide important information. EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: Telemedicine refers to the use of electronic information and telecommunications tools to provide remote clinical health care support. Smart working is a model of work that uses new or existing technologies to improve performance. Telemedicine is becoming a useful invaluable tool during and even beyond the COVID-19 pandemic. It is time for us to formalize the place of telemedicine in routine urological practice, and it is our responsibility to adapt and learn about all the tools and possible strategies for their optimal implementation during the pandemic to ensure that the quality of care received by patients and the outcomes of patients and their families are of the highest standard. CONCLUSIONS: Telemedicine facilitates specialized urological clinical support at a distance, solves problems of limitations in mobility, reduces unnecessary visits to clinics, and is useful for reducing the risk of viral transmission in the current COVID-19 outbreak. Furthermore, both personal and societal considerations may favor continued use of telemedicine, even beyond the COVID-19 pandemic. PATIENT SUMMARY: Telemedicine in urology offers specialized remote clinical support to patients, similar to face-to-face visits. It is very useful for reducing unnecessary visits to the clinic, as well as reducing the risk of contagion in the current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic.","Rodriguez Socarrás, Moises; Loeb, Stacy; Teoh, Jeremy Yuen-Chun; Ribal, Maria J.; Bloemberg, Jarka; Catto, James; N’Dow, James; Van Poppel, Hendrik; Gómez Rivas, Juan",Eur Urol,576,16

The computed information is transferred through a Z-Wave network. On-field evaluation of the algorithm has been conducted by placing the device on top of doorways in offices and laboratory rooms. To evaluate the performance of the algorithm in varying ambient temperatures, two groups of stress tests have been designed and performed. These tests established the detection limits linked to the difference between the average ambient temperature and perturbation. For an in-depth analysis of the accuracy of the algorithm, synthetic data have been generated considering temperature ranges typical of a residential environment, different human walking speeds (normal, brisk, running), and distance between the person and the sensor (1.5 m, 5 m, 7.5 m).

To date, no clear approach exists to discriminate patients at high risk for venous thromboembolism (VTE). OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study is to externally validate the IMPROVE‐DD risk assessment model (RAM) for VTE in a large cohort of hospitalized patients with COVID‐19 within a multihospital health system. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study evaluated the IMPROVE‐DD RAM on adult inpatients with COVID‐19 hospitalized between March 1, 2020, and April 27, 2020. Diagnosis of VTE was defined by new acute deep venous thrombosis or pulmonary embolism by Radiology Department imaging or point‐of‐care ultrasound. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was plotted and area under the curve (AUC) calculated. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) were calculated using standard methods. RESULTS: A total of 9407 patients were included, with a VTE prevalence of 2.9%. The VTE rate was 0.4% for IMPROVE‐DD score 0‐1 (low risk), 1.3% for score 2‐3 (moderate risk), and 5.3% for score ≥ 4 (high risk). Approximately 45% of the total population scored high VTE risk, while 21% scored low VTE risk. IMPROVE‐DD discrimination of low versus medium/high risk showed sensitivity of 0.971, specificity of 0.218, PPV of 0.036, and NPV of 0.996. ROC AUC was 0.702. CONCLUSIONS: The IMPROVE‐DD VTE RAM demonstrated very good discrimination to identify hospitalized patients with COVID‐19 as low, moderate, and high VTE risk in this large external validation study with potential to individualize thromboprophylactic strategies.","Spyropoulos, Alex C.; Cohen, Stuart L.; Gianos, Eugenia; Kohn, Nina; Giannis, Dimitrios; Chatterjee, Saurav; Goldin, Mark; Lesser, Marty; Coppa, Kevin; Hirsch, Jamie S.; McGinn, Thomas; Barish, Matthew A.",Res Pract Thromb Haemost,576,25

The aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) infection in asymptomatic cancer patients attending the outpatient clinic of a general hospital in a region with a high prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection (North Italy, first wave). Methods We retrospectively analyzed data of consecutive cancer patients attending the outpatient clinic of the oncology unit, General Hospital of Piacenza. All the patients having underlying cancer, without clinical suspicion of COVID-19, attending the outpatient clinic underwent nasopharyngeal swabs, from April 3, 2020 to June 3, 2020 and were included in this study. Results In a two-month period, 260 consecutive, asymptomatic (for COVID-19) cancer patients were tested for COVID-19. There were 160 women and 100 men; 218 patients were under active anticancer treatment, 32 in the diagnostic/staging phase waiting for treatment, and 10 treated with supportive care only. Ten of the 260 patients (3.85%) showed COVID-19 positivity. All but one (treated with hormone therapy) of the COVID-19 positive patients delayed anticancer treatment. The mean delay of anticancer treatment was 45.86±27.66 days (range 21-87 days), and the mean time for viral clearance was 25.7±22.68 days (range 7-79 days). All the 10 patients with COVID-19 and cancer overcame the infection, and treated patients could restart anticancer treatment. Conclusion Our data indicate a high prevalence of COVID-19 in cancer patients in an area with a high prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Routine COVID-19 testing of cancer patients when asymptomatic allowed an early detection, isolation, and treatment, avoiding viral spread among other frail patients and among medical/nurse staff.","Cavanna, Luigi; Citterio, Chiara; Di Nunzio, Camilla; Biasini, Claudia; Palladino, Maria Angela; Ambroggi, Massimo; Madaro, Serena; Bidin, Livia; Porzio, Rosa; Proietto, Manuela",Cureus,576,24

However, the evolution of the dependence structure and the unevenness characteristics of precipitation are rarely considered. This study applied a two-stage bias correction to daily precipitation and max/min temperature data in the Daqing River Basin (DQRB) with the HadGEM3-RA climate model. Validated from 1981 to 2015, future scenarios under two emission paths covering 2031–2065 and 2066–2100 were projected to assess variations in both the amount and unevenness of precipitation. The results suggested that, overall, the two-stage bias correction could reproduce the marginal distributions of variables and the evolution process of the dependence structure. In the future, the amount of precipitation in the plains is expected to increase more than that in the mountains, while precipitation unevenness, as measured by relative entropy, shows a slight increase in the mountains and a decrease in the plains, with enhanced seasonality. Conditioned on rising temperatures, high-/low-intensity precipitation tends to intensify/weaken precipitation unevenness. Additionally, the potential application of the bias correction method used herein and the possible impacts of uneven precipitation on nonpoint source pollution are given for further analyses.

We examined COVID-19 related hospitalisations by city district and migration background in the municipality of Amsterdam, the Netherlands. Methods We used surveillance data on all PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 hospitalisations in Amsterdam until 31 May 2020, matched to municipal registration data on migration background. We calculated directly standardised (age, sex) rates (DSR) of hospitalisations, as a proxy of COVID-19 burden, per 100,000 population by city district and migration background. We calculated standardised rate differences (RD) and rate ratios (RR) to compare hospitalisations between city districts of varying socio-economic and health status and between migration backgrounds. We evaluated the effects of city district and migration background on hospitalisation after adjusting for age and sex using Poisson regression. Results Between 29 February and 31 May 2020, 2326 cases (median age 57 years [IQR=37-74]) were notified in Amsterdam, of which 596 (25.6%) hospitalisations and 287 (12.3%) deaths. 526/596 (88.2%) hospitalisations could be matched to the registration database. DSR were higher in individuals living in peripheral (South-East/New-West/North) city districts with lower economic and health status, compared to central districts (Centre/West/South/East) (RD=36.87,95%CI=25.79-47.96;RR=1.82,95%CI=1.65-1.99), and among individuals with a non-Western migration background compared to ethnic-Dutch individuals (RD=57.05,95%CI=43.34-70.75; RR=2.36,95%CI=2.17-2.54). City district and migration background were independently associated with hospitalisation. Conclusion City districts with lower economic and health status and those with a non-Western migration background had the highest burden of COVID-19 during the first wave of COVID-19 in Amsterdam.","Coyer, L.; Wynberg, E.; Buster, M.; Wijffels, C.; Prins, M.; Schreijer, A.; van Duijnhoven, Y.

This interaction has been proposed as a potential risk factor in patients treated with RAAS-inhibitors. Objectives To analyze if RAAS-inhibitors modify the risk for COVID-19. Methods RASTAVI (NCT03201185) is an ongoing randomized clinical trial randomly allocating Ramipril or control after successful transcatheter aortic valve replacement at 14 centers is Spain. We performed a non-pre-specified interim analysis to evaluate its impact on COVID-19 risk in this vulnerable population. Results As in April 1st 2020, 102 patients (50 Ramipril and 52 controls) were included in the trial. Mean age was 82.3±6.1 years, 56.9% males. Median time of Ramipril treatment was 6 months [IQR:2.9-11.4]. Eleven patients (10.8%) have been diagnosed with COVID-19 (6 in control group and 5 receiving Ramipril, HR=1.150 [95%CI: 0.351-3.768]). The risk of COVID-19 was increased in older patients (p=0.019), those with atrial fibrillation (p=0.066), lower hematocrit (p=0.084), and more comorbidities according to Society of thoracic surgeons score (p=0.065). Admission and oxygen supply was required in 4.9% (2 patients in the Ramipril and 3 in control), and 4 of them died (two in each randomized group). A higher body mass index was the only factor increasing the mortality rate (p=0.039). Conclusions In a high risk population of old patients with cardiovascular disease, randomization to Ramipril had no impact in the incidence or severity of COVID-19. This analysis supports the maintenance of RAAS-inhibitor treatment during COVID-19 crisis.","Amat-Santos, Ignacio J.; Santos-Martinez, Sandra; López-Otero, Diego; Nombela-Franco, Luis; Gutiérrez-Ibanes, Enrique; Del Valle, Raquel; Muñoz-García, Erika; Jiménez-Diaz, Víctor A.; Regueiro, Ander; González-Ferreiro, Rocío; Benito, Tomás; Sanmartin-Pena, Xoan Carlos; Catalá, Pablo; Rodríguez-Gabella, Tania; Delgado-Arana, Jose Raúl; Carrasco-Moraleja, Manuel; Ibañez, Borja; San Román, J.

Abnormality in liver function tests (LFTs) has been commonly observed in patients with COVID‐19, but there is controversy on its clinical significance. The aim of this study was to assess the prevalence, the characteristics and the clinical impact of abnormal LFTs in hospitalized, non‐critically ill patients with COVID‐19. METHODS: In this multicenter, retrospective study, we collected data about 565 inpatients with COVID‐19. Data on LFTs were collected at admission and every 7±2 days during the hospitalization. The primary outcome was a composite endpoint of death or transfer to intensive care unit (ICU). RESULTS: Upon admission 329 patients (58%) had LFTs abnormality. Patients with abnormal LFTs had more severe inflammation and higher degree of organ dysfunction than those without. During hospitalization, patients with abnormal LFTs had a higher rate of transfer to ICU (20vs8%; p<0.001), acute kidney injury (22vs13%, p=0.009), need for mechanical ventilation (14vs6%; p=0.005), and mortality (21vs11%; p=0.004) than those without. In multivariate analysis, patients with abnormal LFTs had a higher risk of the composite endpoint of death or transfer to ICU (OR=3.53; p<0.001). During the hospitalization, 86 patients developed de novo LFTs abnormality, which was associated with the use of tocilizumab, lopinavir/ritonavir and acetaminophen and not clearly associated with the composite endpoint. CONCLUSIONS: LFTs abnormality is common at admission in patients with COVID‐19, is associated with systemic inflammation, organ dysfunction and is an independent predictor of transfer to ICU or death.","Piano, Salvatore; Dalbeni, Andrea; Vettore, Elia; Benfaremo, Devis; Mattioli, Massimo; Gambino, Carmine Gabriele; Framba, Viviana; Cerruti, Lorenzo; Mantovani, Anna; Martini, Andrea; Luchetti, Michele Maria; Serra, Roberto; Cattelan, Annamaria; Vettor, Roberto; Angeli, Paolo",Liver Int,576,1

Researchers employ various study-specific screening criteria to reduce potential variables associated with subsequent re-use of NHPs. However, criteria set for NHP re-assignments largely neglect the impact of previous exposures on overall biology. Since the immune system is a key determinant of overall biological outcome, an altered biological state could be predicted by monitoring global changes in the immune profile. We postulate that every different exposure or a condition can generate a unique global immune profile in NHPs. METHODS: Changes in the global immune profile were evaluated in three different groups of rhesus macaques previously enrolled in dengue or malaria vaccine studies over six months after their last exposure. Naïve animals served as the baseline. Fresh blood samples were stained with various immune cell surface markers and analyzed by multi-color flow-cytometry to study immune cell dynamics in the peripheral blood. Serum cytokine profile in the pre-exposed animals were analyzed by mesoscale assay using a customized U-PLEX NHP biomarker panel of 12 cytokines/chemokines. RESULTS: Pre-exposed macaques showed altered dynamics in circulating cytokines and certain innate and adaptive immune cell subsets such as monocytes, HLA-DR+NKT cells, B cells and T cells. Some of these changes were transient, while some lasted for more than six months. Each group seemed to develop a global immune profile unique to their particular exposure. CONCLUSION: Our data strongly suggest that re-used NHPs should be evaluated for long-term, overall immunological changes and randomly assigned to new studies to avoid study bias.","Bates, François A.; Duncan, Elizabeth H.; Simmons, Monika; Robinson, Tanisha; Samineni, Sridhar; Strbo, Natasa; Villasante, Eileen; Bergmann-Leitner, Elke; Wijayalath, Wathsala",PeerJ,576,16

New ligands that target the N protein may thus provide tools to track the protein inside cells, detect interaction hot spots on the protein surface, and discover sites that could be used to develop new anti-SARS therapies. Using mRNA display selection and directed evolution, we designed novel antibody-like protein affinity reagents that target SARS N protein with high affinity and selectivity. Our libraries were based on an 88-residue variant of the 10th fibronectin type III domain from human fibronectin (10Fn3). This selection resulted in eight independent 10Fn3 intrabodies, two that require the N-terminal domain for binding and six that recognize the C terminus, one with K(d) = 1.7 nm. 10Fn3 intrabodies are well expressed in mammalian cells and are relocalized by N in SARS-infected cells. Seven of the selected intrabodies tested do not perturb cellular function when expressed singly in vivo and inhibit virus replication from 11- to 5900-fold when expressed in cells prior to infection. Targeting two sites on SARS-N simultaneously using two distinct 10Fn3s results in synergistic inhibition of virus replication.","Liao, Hsiang-I.; Olson, C.

Nevertheless, the economic value of the compensation is significantly high, for example, in cases of children who suffered multiple disabilities following perinatal lesions with a long life expectancy. In Italy, most of the claims for compensation concern surgical pathologies and infections. Among these latter, the dominant role is taken by respiratory tract infections. In this context, the purpose of this manuscript is to present a case series of infant deaths in different emergency-related facilities (ambulances, emergency rooms) denounced by relatives. Following these complaints, the autopsy was performed, and subsequent histological examinations revealed the presence of typical and pathognomonic histological findings of acute viral bronchiolitis, whose morphological appearance is poorly reported in the literature. The analysis of these cases made it possible to highlight the following conclusions: the main problems in diagnosing sudden death causes, especially in childhood, are the rapidity of death and the scarce correlation between the preexistent diseases and of the cause of death itself. For all these reasons, the autopsy, either clinical or medicolegal, is mandatory in cases of sudden unexpected infant death to manage claim requests because only the histological examinations performed on samples collected during the autopsy can reveal the real cause of death.","Bertozzi, Giuseppe; Maglietta, Francesca; Baldari, Benedetta; Besi, Livia; Torsello, Alessandra; Di Gioia, Cira Rosaria Tiziana; Sessa, Francesco; Aromatario, Mariarosaria; Cipolloni, Luigi",Front Pediatr,576,8

The most adept of these cells are a closely related family termed dendritic cells (DC). A subset of these act as peripheral sentinels, specializing in the uptake, processing and presentation of antigenic material combined with an ability to detect a wide variety of ‘danger’ signals. These ‘danger’ or activation signals induce profound changes in dendritic cell physiology, facilitating the efficient stimulation of both adaptive and innate immunity. In the present review, a number of recent advances in the understanding of DC biology are discussed.

Understanding patients’ hematologic findings in SARS-CoV-2 infection is essential to doing their prognosis, so adjusting care and improving outcomes. OBJECTIVE: In this review, we aim at summarizing changes in the hematopoietic system and hemostasis that occur in SARS-CoV-2 infected patients. FINDINGS: COVID-19 infection is often associated with laboratory hematologic features that can have important clinical implications. Careful revision of baseline hematologic data at diagnosis can predict the severity of illness and help clinicians tailoring the approach and management of patients whose condition can be guarded or critical. The levels of hematologic markers like D-dimer, procalcitonin, C-reactive protein, viral load, inflammatory cytokines, differential blood cell count, and peripheral smear are fundamental for the prognosis. Studies have also shown an association between some of these markers and severe COVID-19 infection requiring admission to the intensive care unit or complicated by acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Since, so far, a vaccine is not available, prevention of the infection is based on the avoiding people affected and the spreading of the virus; the treatment, in the absence of an effective antiviral agent, is symptomatic, and, in addition to oxygen support, finds in the anti-inflammatory drugs and anticoagulation fundamental therapeutic lines. According to the American Society of Hematology (ASH), all hospitalized patients with COVID-19 should receive pharmacologic thromboprophylaxis with LMWH.","Kreidieh, Firas; Temraz, Sally",Mediterr J Hematol Infect Dis,576,16

This review critically surveys the chronological development of biological classification from Aristotle through our postgenomic era with a central focus on cladistics. In 1957, Julian Huxley coined cladogenesis to denote splitting from subspeciation. In 1960, the English translation of Willi Hennig’s 1950 work, Systematic Phylogenetics, was published, which received strong opposition from pheneticists, such as numerical taxonomists Peter Sneath and Robert Sokal, and evolutionary taxonomist, Ernst Mayr, and sparked acrimonious debates in 1960–1980. In 1977–1990, Carl Woese pioneered in using small subunit rRNA gene sequences to delimitate the three domains of cellular life and established major prokaryotic phyla. Cladistics has since dominated taxonomy. Despite being compatible with modern microbiological observations, i.e. organisms with unusual phenotypes, restricted expression of characteristics and occasionally being uncultivable, increasing recognition of pervasiveness and abundance of horizontal gene transfer has challenged relevance and validity of cladistics. The mosaic nature of eukaryotic and prokaryotic genomes was also gradually discovered. In the mid-2000s, high-throughput and whole-genome sequencing became routine and complex geneologies of organisms have led to the proposal of a reticulated web of life. While genomics only indirectly leads to understanding of functional adaptations to ecological niches, computational modeling of entire organisms is underway and the gap between genomics and phenetics may soon be bridged. Controversies are not expected to settle as taxonomic classifications shall remain subjective to serve the human scientist, not the classified.","Ho, Chi-Chun; Lau, Susanna K. P.; Woo, Patrick C.

One such opportunistic fungal infection is mucormycosis. Initially, it was debated whether a person taking immunosuppressants, such as corticosteroids, and monoclonal antibodies will be at higher risk for COVID-19 or whether the immunosuppresive state would cause a more severe COVID-19 disease. However, immunosuppressants are currently continued unless the patients are at greater risk of severe COVID-19 infection or are on high-dose corticosteroids therapy. As understood so far, COVID-19 infection may induce significant and persistent lymphopenia, which in turn increases the risk of opportunistic infections. It is also noted that 85% of the COVID-19 patients’ laboratory findings showed lymphopenia. This means that patients with severe COVID-19 have markedly lower absolute number of T lymphocytes, CD4+T and CD8+ T cells and, since the lymphocytes play a major role in maintaining the immune homeostasis, the patients with COVID-19 are highly susceptible to fungal co-infections. This report is intended to raise awareness of the importance of early detection and treatment of mucormycosis and other fungal diseases, such as candidiasis, SARS-CoV-2-associated pulmonary aspergillosis, pneumocystis pneumonia and cryptococcal disease, in COVID-19 patients, to reduce the risk of mortality.","Bhatt, Kinal; Agolli, Arjola; Patel, Mehrie H.; Garimella, Radhika; Devi, Madhuri; Garcia, Efrain; Amin, Harshad; Domingue, Carlos; Guerra Del Castillo, Roberto; Sanchez-Gonzalez, Marcos",Discoveries,576,32

It is believed that cases of photosensitivity may be underreported, causing inaccurate and inflated reports of mortality. Additionally, because secondary photosensitization in grazing cattle occurs with liver damage or dysfunction, photosensitivity can have many potential or associated causes. This case links a previous occurrence of coccidiosis to an outbreak of photosensitivity in grazing Holstein steers. Grazing management staff first observed clinical signs of photosensitivity 17 days after an outbreak of coccidiosis and subsequent turnout to spring pastures. Clinical signs were observed in 25% of the population. The severity of photosensitivity was variable and ranged from blistered skin on the muzzle to sloughing of unpigmented epidermis and thinly haired regions. Severely affected cattle were removed from pasture, housed under shade, monitored for infection, and recovered without treatment. Mild cases remained on pasture and recovered without treatment. Photosensitivity did not reoccur in the cattle that remained on pasture or in mildly affected cattle returned to pasture. Photosensitivity did not appear to be associated with pasture weeds, a specific forage species, or variable or extreme weather conditions that could have resulted in mycotoxin production. The occurrence appears to have been a result of a previous and concurrent coccidiosis outbreak that caused secondary photosensitization through hepatic lipidosis caused by anorexia and dehydration associated with the severe coccidiosis. Although clinical signs appeared suddenly, cattle recovered quickly and without treatment.","Nieman, Christine C.; Schaefer, Daniel M.; Maroney, Michael; Nelson, Kathryn; Albrecht, Kenneth A.",Vet Sci,576,24

This paper provides a review of the evidence that ECE environments benefit Latino children and mitigate the impact of adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) and other poverty-related risks; however, Latino families face numerous barriers to accessing ECE opportunities for their children. While enrollment by Latino children in ECE programs has grown in prior decades, further increases in access to ECE are needed to benefit Latino children, who are disproportionately impacted by poverty. In addition, ECE programs, especially high-quality and dual generation–focused programs like Early Head Start and Head Start, are in a strong position to help offset the risk for poor educational and mental health outcomes due to Latino’s children’s exposure to stressors such as discrimination and ACEs. Gaps remain in how well ECE is serving Latino families due to a combination of factors including parental work schedules, heritage language and cultural factors, and the lack of affordable and available ECE programs in Latino communities. To remedy these gaps, researchers must continue to further elucidate the needs, preferences, and gaps regarding access to early care and education opportunities for Latino children. For those studying trauma and ACEs among low-income children, greater attention to how preventative interventions or treatments that are embedded in ECE settings serve Latino populations is warranted, as this has the tremendous potential to mitigate the long-term impact of ACEs on Latino children. The paper concludes with a set of early childhood practice and policy recommendations for enhancing protective experiences for low-income Latino children.","Smith, Julia Mendez",Advers Resil Sci,576,1

This study sought to investigate whether blood glucose (BG) levels or comorbid diabetes are associated with inflammatory status and disease severity in patients with COVID-19. METHODS: In this retrospective cohort study, the clinical and biochemical characteristics of COVID-19 patients with or without diabetes were compared. The relationship among severity of COVID-19, inflammatory status, and diabetes or hyperglycemia was analyzed. The severity of COVID-19 in all patients was determined according to the diagnostic and treatment guidelines issued by the Chinese National Health Committee (7th edition). RESULTS: Four hundred and sixty-one patients were enrolled in our study, and 71.58% of patients with diabetes and 13.03% of patients without diabetes had hyperglycemia. Compared with patients without diabetes (n = 366), patients with diabetes (n = 95) had a higher leucocyte count, neutrophil count, neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR), and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR). There was no association between severity of COVID-19 and known diabetes adjusted for age, sex, body mass index (BMI), known hypertension, and coronary heart disease. The leucocyte count, NLR, and C-reactive protein (CRP) level increased with increasing BG level. Hyperglycemia was an independent predictor of critical (OR 4.00, 95% CI 1.72-9.30) or severe (OR 3.55, 95% CI 1.47-8.58) COVID-19, and of increased inflammatory levels (high leucocyte count (OR 4.26, 95% CI 1.65-10.97), NLR (OR 2.76, 95% CI 1.24-6.10), and CRP level (OR 2.49, 95% CI 1.19-5.23)), after adjustment for age, sex, BMI, severity of illness, and known diabetes. CONCLUSION: Hyperglycemia was positively correlated with higher inflammation levels and more severe illness, and it is a risk factor for the increased severity of COVID-19. The initial measurement of plasma glucose levels after hospitalization may help identify a subset of patients who are predisposed to a worse clinical course.","Zhang, Wen; Li, Chuanwei; Xu, Yu; He, Binfeng; Hu, Mingdong; Cao, Guoqiang; Li, Li; Wu, Shuang; Wang, Xia; Zhang, Chun; Zhao, Jianping; Xie, Jungang; Xu, Zihui; Li, Qi; Wang, Guansong",Mediators Inflamm,576,16

Based on these observations we propose a hypothesis that those who harbor elevated frequencies of MN within their cells are more prone to RNA virus infection and are more likely, through combined effects of leakage of self-DNA from MN and RNA from viruses, to escalate pro-inflammatory cytokine production via the cyclic GMP–AMP synthase (cGAS), stimulator of interferon genes (STING) and the Senescence Associated Secretory Phenotype (SASP) mechanisms to an extent that is unresolvable and therefore confers high risk of causing tissue damage by an excessive and overtly toxic immune response. The corollaries from this hypothesis are (i) those with abnormally high MN frequency are more prone to infection by RNA viruses; (ii) the extent of cytokine production and pro-inflammatory response to infection by RNA viruses is enhanced and possibly exceeds threshold levels that may be unresolvable in those with elevated MN levels in affected organs; (iii) reduction of MN frequency by improving nutrition and life-style factors increases resistance to RNA virus infection and moderates inflammatory cytokine production to a level that is immunologically efficacious and survivable.","Kirsch-Volders, Micheline; Fenech, Michael",Mutat Res Rev Mutat Res,576,20

This year marks the twentieth anniversary of the identification of pteropid bats (flying-foxes) as the natural host of the virus, and it is timely to reflect on a pivotal meeting of an eclectic group of scientists in that process. They included animal and public health experts, environmental scientists, veterinary and horse industry representatives, and wildlife experts. The task was to review and prioritise wildlife surveillance seeking the origin of the previously unknown virus. The group determined that the likely reservoir must occur in disparate locations, and be capable of moving between locations, or exist in continuous, overlapping populations spanning multiple locations. Flying-foxes were considered to be a more probable source of the novel virus than birds. Within weeks, antibodies were detected in several species of flying-fox, and the virus was subsequently isolated. While the identification of the natural host of Hendra virus within 18 months of its description was remarkable in itself, a broader legacy followed. In the subsequent years, a suite of zoonotic viruses including Australian bat lyssavirus, Nipah virus, SARS coronavirus, and Ebola and Marburg viruses have been detected in bats. Bats are now the “go to” taxa for novel viruses. History has repeatedly demonstrated that knowledge begets knowledge. This simple notion of bringing a diverse group of people together in an environment of mutual respect reinforced this principle and proves that the sum is often so much more powerful than the parts.","Black, Peter; Douglas, Ian; Field, Hume",One Health,576,3

Medical school is a stressful environment. The outbreak of COVID-19 has added to the plight of medical students. This study was conducted to determine the prevalence of depression among medical students of a medical college in Nepal during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS A descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted among medical students of a medical college in Nepal from August 2020 to September 2020. The sample size of our study was 223. A convenient sampling method was adopted for the selection of respondents. The study was approved by the Institutional Review Committee (Reference no:321). The data were analyzed using Statistical Package for Social Sciences version 22. Point estimate at 95% Confidence Interval was calculated along with frequency and proportion for binary data. The study instrument consisted of the Patient Health Questionnaire and socio-demographic information. RESULTS Out of 223 participants, the prevalence of depression was seen among 52 (23.3%) (17.7%-28.9% at 95% Confidence Interval) students in our study. Among them, 25 (48.1%) females and 27 (51.9%) males were depressed. The prevalence of depression was higher in preclinical years (first and second year) than in clinical years (third, fourth and final year). CONCLUSIONS The prevalence of depression among medical students in Nepal during the pandemic was less than the findings of similar studies conducted in Nepal before the pandemic. Further studies are required to get more knowledge about the factors associated with mental health of medical students.","Adhikari, Aarshee; Sujakhu, Ezna; G C, Sandervee; Zoowa, Sabin",JNMA; journal of the Nepal Medical Association,576,16

A large-scale longitudinal study is urgently required. METHODS: We analyzed 606 CT scans of 182 patients. The dynamic evolution of CT scores was evaluated using two staging methods: one was divided into 10 periods based on decile intervals, and the other was one stage per week. Moreover, the latter was used to evaluate the dynamic evolution of imaging performance. A published severity scoring system was used to compare findings of the two methods. RESULTS: In the dynamic evolution of 10 stages, the total lesion CT score peaked during stage 3 (9–11 days) and stage 6 (17–18 days), with scores = 7.19 ± 3.66 and 8.00 ± 4.57, respectively. The consolidation score peaked during stage 6 (17–18 days; score = 2.72 ± 3.07). In contrast, when a 1-week interval was used and time was divided into five stages, the total lesion score peaked during week 3 (score = 7.3 ± 4.15). The consolidation score peaked during week 2 (score = 2.54 ± 3.25). The predominant CT patterns differed significantly during each stage (P < 0.01). Ground-glass opacities (GGO), with an increased trend during week 3 and beyond, was the most common pattern in each stage (33–46%). The second most common patterns during week 1 were GGO and consolidation (24%). The linear opacity pattern with an increased trend was the second most common pattern during week 2 and beyond (21–32%). CONCLUSIONS: The total lesion score of mild COVID-19 pneumonia peaked 17–18 days after disease onset. The consolidation scores objectively reflected the severity of the lung involvement compared with total lesion scores. Each temporal stage of mild COVID-19 pneumonia mainly manifested as GGO pattern. Moreover, good prognosis may be associated with increases in the proportions of the GGO and linear opacity patterns during the later stage of disease.","Liu, Huaping; Luo, Shiyong; Zhang, Youming; Jiang, Yuzhu; Jiang, Yuting; Wang, Yayi; Li, Hailan; Huang, Chiyao; Zhang, Shunzhen; Li, Xili; Tan, Yiqing; Wang, Wei",Infect Dis Ther,576,1

We present our standard practices around ECMO decision-making, retrieval, cannulation, ventilation, anticoagulation, tracheostomy, imaging and steroids. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study using data from the hospital notes on all SARS-CoV-2 patients who required extracorporeal support at St Bartholomew’s Hospital between 1 March 2020 and 31 July 2020. In total, this included 18 patients over this time period. RESULTS: In total, 18 patients were managed with extracorporeal support and of these 14 survived (78%) with 4 deaths (22%). The mean duration from hospital admission to intubation was 4.1 ± 3.4 days, mean time from intubation to ECMO 2.3 ± 2 days and mean run on ECMO 17.7 ± 9.4 days. Survivor mean days from intubation to extubation was 20.6 ± 9.9 days and survivor mean days from intubation to tracheostomy decannulation 46.6 ± 15.3 days. Time from hospital admission to discharge in survivors was a mean of 57.2 ± 25.8 days. Of the patients requiring extracorporeal support, the initial mode was veno-venous (VV) in 15 (83%), veno-arterial (VA) in 2 (11%) and veno-venous-arterial (VVA) in 1 (6%). On VV extracorporeal support, 2 (11%) required additional VVA. Renal replacement therapy was required in 10 (56%) of the patients. Anticoagulation target anti-Xa of 0.2–0.4 was set, with 10 (56%) patients having a deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism detected and 2 (11%) patients suffering an intracranial haemorrhage. Tracheostomy was performed in 9 (50%) of the patients and high-dose methylprednisolone was given to 7 (39%) of the patients. CONCLUSION: In our cohort of patients with severe SARS-CoV-2 respiratory failure, a long period of invasive ventilation and extracorporeal support was required but achieving good outcomes despite this. There was a significant burden of thromboembolic disease and renal injury. A significant proportion of patients required tracheostomy and steroids to facilitate weaning.","Akhtar, Waqas; Olusanya, Olusegun; Baladia, Marta Montero; Young, Harriet; Shah, Sachin",Indian J Thorac Cardiovasc Surg,576,24

Nowadays, the WHO recognizes traditional, complementary, and alternative medicine for treating COVID-19 symptoms. Therefore, we investigated the antiviral potential of the hydroalcoholic extract of Uncaria tomentosa stem bark from Peru against SARS-CoV-2 in vitro. The antiviral activity of U. tomentosa against SARS-CoV-2 in vitro was assessed in Vero E6 cells using cytopathic effect (CPE) and plaque reduction assay. After 48 h of treatment, U. tomentosa showed an inhibition of 92.7% of SARS-CoV-2 at 25.0 μg/mL (p < 0.0001) by plaque reduction assay on Vero E6 cells. In addition, U. tomentosa induced a reduction of 98.6% (p=0.02) and 92.7% (p=0.03) in the CPE caused by SARS-CoV-2 on Vero E6 cells at 25 μg/mL and 12.5 μg/mL, respectively. The EC50 calculated for the U. tomentosa extract by plaque reduction assay was 6.6 μg/mL (4.89–8.85 μg/mL) for a selectivity index of 4.1. The EC50 calculated for the U. tomentosa extract by TCID50 assay was 2.57 μg/mL (1.05–3.75 μg/mL) for a selectivity index of 10.54. These results showed that U. tomentosa, known as cat's claw, has an antiviral effect against SARS-CoV-2, which was observed as a reduction in the viral titer and CPE after 48 h of treatment on Vero E6 cells. Therefore, we hypothesized that U. tomentosa stem bark could be promising in the development of new therapeutic strategies against SARS-CoV-2.","Yepes-Perez, Andres F.; Herrera-Calderón, Oscar; Oliveros, Cristian A.; Flórez-Álvarez, Lizdany; Zapata-Cardona, María I.; Yepes, Lina; Aguilar-Jimenez, Wbeimar; Rugeles, María T.; Zapata, Wildeman",Evid Based Complement Alternat Med,576,31

However, the association between autonomy, optimism, work engagement and organisational citizenship behaviour remains largely unexplored. This study aimed to test if the effect of autonomy on organisational citizenship behaviour through the mediating effects of optimism and work engagement. STUDY DESIGN: This was a cross-sectional study. SETTING: The study was conducted in the Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital in China. PARTICIPANTS: In total, 242 nurses who came from multiple areas of China to work at the Wuhan Jinyintan hospital during the COVID-19 epidemic participated in this study. METHODS: A serial mediation model (model 6) of the PROCESS macro in SPSS was adopted to test the hypotheses, and a 95% CI for the indirect effects was constructed by using Bootstrapping. RESULTS: The autonomy–organisational citizenship behaviour relationship was mediated by optimism and work engagement, respectively. In addition, optimism and work engagement mediated this relationship serially. CONCLUSION: The findings of this study may have implications for improving organisational citizenship behaviour. The effects of optimism and work engagement suggest a potential mechanism of action for the autonomy–organisational citizenship behaviour linkage. A multifaceted intervention targeting organisational citizenship behaviour through optimism and work engagement may help improve the quality of nursing care among nurses supporting patients with COVID-19.","Zhang, Hui; Zhao, Yi; Zou, Ping; Liu, Yang; Lin, Shuanghong; Ye, Zhihong; Tang, Leiwen; Shao, Jing; Chen, Dandan",BMJ Open,576,1

What’s more troubling is how systemic racism impacts children from all races and has been perpetuated across many generations dating back hundreds of years. The impact of racial oppression is seen through intergenerational trauma which impacts youth in varying ways. For this article, we offer three areas in which racism causes healthcare disparities, intergenerational trauma, social determinants, and cultural mistrust.

Such information can be challenging to acquire in electronic health records, as it is often available only in unstructured text. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to assess the feasibility of annotating and automatically extracting travel history mentions from unstructured clinical documents in the Department of Veterans Affairs across disparate health care facilities and among millions of patients. Information about travel exposure augments existing surveillance applications for increased preparedness in responding quickly to public health threats. METHODS: Clinical documents related to arboviral disease were annotated following selection using a semiautomated bootstrapping process. Using annotated instances as training data, models were developed to extract from unstructured clinical text any mention of affirmed travel locations outside of the continental United States. Automated text processing models were evaluated, involving machine learning and neural language models for extraction accuracy. RESULTS: Among 4584 annotated instances, 2659 (58%) contained an affirmed mention of travel history, while 347 (7.6%) were negated. Interannotator agreement resulted in a document-level Cohen kappa of 0.776. Automated text processing accuracy (F1 85.6, 95% CI 82.5-87.9) and computational burden were acceptable such that the system can provide a rapid screen for public health events. CONCLUSIONS: Automated extraction of patient travel history from clinical documents is feasible for enhanced passive surveillance public health systems. Without such a system, it would usually be necessary to manually review charts to identify recent travel or lack of travel, use an electronic health record that enforces travel history documentation, or ignore this potential source of information altogether. The development of this tool was initially motivated by emergent arboviral diseases. More recently, this system was used in the early phases of response to COVID-19 in the United States, although its utility was limited to a relatively brief window due to the rapid domestic spread of the virus. Such systems may aid future efforts to prevent and contain the spread of infectious diseases.","Peterson, Kelly S; Lewis, Julia; Patterson, Olga V; Chapman, Alec B; Denhalter, Daniel W; Lye, Patricia A; Stevens, Vanessa W; Gamage, Shantini D; Roselle, Gary A; Wallace, Katherine S; Jones, Makoto",JMIR Public Health Surveill,576,16

Particularly worrisome are the high contagiousness of the virus and the saturation of hospitals’ capacity due to overwhelming caseloads. Non-pharmaceutical interventions such as quarantine and inter-personal distancing are crucial to limiting the spread of the virus in the general population, but more tailored interventions may be needed at an individual level on a case-by-case basis. In this perspective, the most insidious situation is when an individual has contact with a contagious subject without adequate protection. If rapidly recognized afterwards, this occurrence may be promptly addressed through a post-exposure chemoprophylaxis (PEP) with antiviral drugs. This strategy has been implemented for other respiratory viruses (influenza above all) and was successfully used in South Korea among healthcare workers against the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronavirus, by providing people who were exposed to high-risk contacts with lopinavir-ritonavir plus ribavirin. Initial experiences with the use of hydroxychloroquine to prevent COVID-19 also seem promising. Post-exposure chemoprophylaxis might help mitigate the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in the current phase of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Gentile, Ivan; Maraolo, Alberto Enrico; Piscitelli, Prisco; Colao, Annamaria",Int J Environ Res Public Health,576,29

Such critically ill COVID‐19 patients may be suspected of heparin‐induced thrombocytopenia (HIT), given similar clinical features. OBJECTIVES: We investigated the presence of platelet‐activating anti‐platelet‐factor 4 (PF4)/heparin antibodies in critically ill COVID‐19 patients suspected of HIT. PATIENTS/METHODS: We tested 10 critically ill COVID‐19 patients suspected of HIT for anti‐PF4/heparin antibodies and functional platelet activation in the serotonin release assay (SRA). Anti‐human CD32 antibody (IV.3) was added to the SRA to confirm FcγRIIA involvement. Additionally, SARS‐CoV‐2 antibodies were measured using an in‐house ELISA. Finally, von Willebrand factor (VWF) antigen and activity were measured along with A Disintegrin And Metalloprotease with ThromboSpondin‐13 Domain (ADAMTS13) activity and the presence of anti‐ADAMTS13 antibodies. RESULTS: Heparin‐induced thrombocytopenia was excluded in all samples based on anti‐PF4/heparin antibody and SRA results. Notably, six COVID‐19 patients demonstrated platelet activation by the SRA that was inhibited by FcγRIIA receptor blockade, confirming an immune complex (IC)‐mediated reaction. Platelet activation was independent of heparin but inhibited by both therapeutic and high dose heparin. All six samples were positive for antibodies targeting the receptor binding domain (RBD) or the spike protein of the SARS‐CoV‐2 virus. These samples also featured significantly increased VWF antigen and activity, which was not statistically different from the four COVID‐19 samples without platelet activation. ADAMTS13 activity was not severely reduced, and ADAMTS13 inhibitors were not present, thus ruling out a primary thrombotic microangiopathy. CONCLUSIONS: Our study identifies platelet‐activating ICs as a novel mechanism that contributes to critically ill COVID‐19.","Nazy, Ishac; Jevtic, Stefan D.; Moore, Jane C.; Huynh, Angela; Smith, James W.; Kelton, John G.; Arnold, Donald M.",J Thromb Haemost,576,20

The data on the clinical utility of 12-lead electrocardiograms (ECG) to aid with prognosis is limited. Objectives We aim to assess the association of new right heart strain patterns on presenting 12-lead electrocardiogram (RHS-ECG) with outcomes in patients hospitalized with COVID-19. Methods We retrospectively evaluated records from 480 patients who were consecutively admitted with COVID-19. ECGs obtained at the time of presentation in the emergency department (ED) were considered as index ECGs. RHS-ECG was defined by any new right axis deviation, S1Q3T3 pattern, or ST depressions with T-wave inversions in leads V1-3 or II, III, aVF. Multivariable logistic regression was performed to assess whether RHS-ECG is independently associated with our primary outcomes. Results ECGs from the ED were available for 314 patients who were included in the analysis. Most patients were in sinus rhythm, with sinus tachycardia being the most frequent dysrhythmia. RHS-ECG findings were present in 40 (11%) patients. RHS-ECG was significantly associated with the incidence of adverse outcomes and an independent predictor of mortality (adjOR, 15.2 (95% [CI, 5.1-45.2]; P<0.001), the need for mechanical ventilation (adjOR, 8.8 [95% CI, 3.4-23.2]; P<0.001), and their composite (adjOR, 12.1 [95% CI, 4.3-33.9]; P<0.001).

Serious health outcomes linked to vaccinations are rare, and some outcomes may occur incidentally in the vaccinated population. Knowledge of background incidence rates of these medical conditions is a critical component of vaccine safety monitoring to aid in the assessment of adverse events temporally associated with vaccination and to put these events into context with what would be expected due to chance alone. A list of 22 potential adverse events of special interest (AESI), including neurologic, autoimmune, and cardiovascular disorders, was compiled by subject matter experts at the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The most recently available U.S. background rates for these medical conditions, overall and by age, sex, and race/ethnicity (when available), were sourced from reported statistics (data published by medical panels/ associations or federal government reports), and literature reviews in PubMed. This review provides estimates of background incidence rates for medical conditions that may be monitored or studied as AESI during safety surveillance and research for COVID-19 vaccines and other new vaccines.","Gubernot, Diane; Jazwa, Amelia; Niu, Manette; Baumblatt, Jane; Gee, Julianne; Moro, Pedro; Duffy, Jonathan; Harrington, Theresa; McNeil, Michael M.; Broder, Karen; Su, John; Kamidani, Satoshi; Olson, Christine K.; Panagiotakopoulos, Lakshmi; Shimabukuro, Tom; Forshee, Richard; Anderson, Steven; Bennett, Sarah",Vaccine,576,16

Hence, in this study, ATR-FTIR was explored as a potential tool for lactate measurement, as the current techniques depend on sample preparation and fails to provide rapid response. Moreover, the effects of pH on PBS samples (7.4, 7, 6.5 and 6) and change in solution conditions (PBS to whole blood) on spectral features were also investigated. A total 189 spectra from five sets of lactate containing media were obtained. Results suggests that lactate could be measured with more than 90% accuracy in the wavenumber range of 1500–600 cm [Formula: see text]. The findings of this study further suggest that there exist no effects of change in pH or media, when estimating lactate concentration changes in this range of the Mid-IR spectral region.","Baishya, Nystha; Mamouei, Mohammad; Budidha, Karthik; Qassem, Meha; Vadgama, Pankaj; Kyriacou, Panayiotis A.",Molecules,576,16

Installation of m6A by the nuclear RNA methyltransferase METTL3 occurs cotranscriptionally; however, the genomes of some cytoplasmic RNA viruses are also m6A-modified. How the cellular m6A modification machinery impacts coronavirus replication, which occurs exclusively in the cytoplasm, is unknown. Here we show that replication of SARS-CoV-2, the agent responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic, and a seasonal human ß-coronavirus HCoV-OC43, can be suppressed by depletion of METTL3 or cytoplasmic m6A reader proteins YTHDF1 and YTHDF3 and by a highly specific small molecule METTL3 inhibitor. Reduction of infectious titer correlates with decreased synthesis of viral RNAs and the essential nucleocapsid (N) protein. Sites of m6A modification on genomic and subgenomic RNAs of both viruses were mapped by methylated RNA immunoprecipitation sequencing (meRIP-seq). Levels of host factors involved in m6A installation, removal, and recognition were unchanged by HCoV-OC43 infection; however, nuclear localization of METTL3 and cytoplasmic m6A readers YTHDF1 and YTHDF2 increased. This establishes that coronavirus RNAs are m6A-modified and host m6A pathway components control ß-coronavirus replication. Moreover, it illustrates the therapeutic potential of targeting the m6A pathway to restrict coronavirus reproduction.","Burgess, Hannah M; Depledge, Daniel P; Thompson, Letitia; Srinivas, Kalanghad Puthankalam; Grande, Rebecca C; Vink, Elizabeth I; Abebe, Jonathan S; Blackaby, Wesley P; Hendrick, Alan; Albertella, Mark R; Kouzarides, Tony; Stapleford, Kenneth A; Wilson, Angus C; Mohr, Ian",Genes Dev,576,17

Relevant gaps in current patient management were identified. However, some aspects were considered difficult to apply. Future efforts should focus on those items with greatest divergences between importance and feasibility. PURPOSE: To establish a Spanish multidisciplinary expert consensus on secondary fracture prevention. METHODS: A two-round Delphi consensus was conducted, guided by a Scientific Committee. The 43-item study questionnaire was designed from a literature review and a subsequent multidisciplinary expert group (n = 12) discussion. The first-round questionnaire, using a 7-point Likert scale, assessed the experts’ opinion of the current situation, their wish for items to happen, and their prognosis that items would be implemented within 5 years. Items for which consensus was not achieved were included in the second round. Consensus was defined as ≥ 75% agreement or ≥ 75% disagreement. A total of 102 experts from 14 scientific societies were invited to participate. RESULTS: A total of 75 (response rate 73.5%) and 69 (92.0%) experts answered the first and second Delphi rounds, respectively. Participants mean age was 51.8 years [standard deviation (SD): 10.1 years]; being 24.0% rheumatologists, 21.3% primary care physicians, 14.7% geriatricians, 8.0% internal medicine specialists, 8.0% rehabilitation physicians, and 8.0% gynecologists. Consensus was achieved for 79.1% of items (wish, 100%; prognosis, 58.1%). Effective secondary prevention strategies identified as requiring improvement included: clinical report standardization, effective hospital primary care communication (telephone/mail and case managers), health-related quality of life (HRQoL) questionnaires use, and treatment compliance monitoring (prognosis agreement 33.3%, 47.8%, 18.8%, and 55.1%, respectively). CONCLUSION: A consensus was reached by health professionals in their wish to implement strategies to optimize secondary fracture prevention; however, they considered some difficult to apply. Efforts should focus on those items with currently low application and those with greatest divergence between wish and prognosis.","Casado, E.; Blanch, J.; Carbonell, C.; Bastida, J.

The pathogenicity and host antibody responses elicited by low-passage (passage 5; PEDVPT-P5) and high-passage (passage 96; PEDVPT-P96) PEDVPT strains were compared in post-weaning PEDV-seronegative pigs by oral inoculation. PEDVPT-P5-inoculation induced typical diarrhea during 1–9 days post inoculation with fecal viral shedding persisting for 26 days. Compared to PEDVPT-P5, PEDVPT-P96 inoculation induced none-to-mild diarrhea and lower, delayed fecal viral shedding. Although PEDVPT-P96 elicited slightly lower neutralizing antibodies and PEDV-specific immunoglobulin G (IgG) and immunoglobulin A (IgA) titers, a reduction in pathogenicity and viral shedding of the subsequent challenge with PEDVPT-P5 were noted in both PEDVPT-P5- and PEDVPT-P96-inoculated pigs. Alignment and comparison of full-length sequences of PEDVPT-P5 and PEDVPT-P96 revealed 23 nucleotide changes and resultant 19 amino acid substitutions in non-structure proteins 2, 3, 4, 9, 14, 15, spike, open reading frame 3 (ORF3), and membrane proteins with no detectable deletion or insertion. The present study confirmed the pathogenicity of the PEDVPT isolate in conventional post-weaning pigs. Moreover, data regarding viral attenuation and potency of induced antibodies against PEDVPT-P5 identified PEDVPT-P96 as a potential live-attenuated vaccine candidate.","Chang, Yen-Chen; Kao, Chi-Fei; Chang, Chia-Yu; Jeng, Chian-Ren; Tsai, Pei-Shiue; Pang, Victor Fei; Chiou, Hue-Ying; Peng, Ju-Yi; Cheng, Ivan-Chen; Chang, Hui-Wen",Viruses,576,28

METHODS: We included in our study a number of five cases (3 female and 2 male) out of 478 patients examined by F18-FDG PET/CT between March – April 2020, with confirmed diagnostic of cancer. Four patients had lung damages suggestive for the mentioned viral infection and 1 patient had multiple lung metastases from thyroid cancer. All patients were asymptomatic for acute respiratory disease at the time of examination, being subsequently confirmed for the viral infection by specific PCR analysis. RESULTS: The asymptomatic positive SARS-CoV-2 cancer patients discovered incidentally in PET/CT F18-FDG represent 0.83% and their imaging characteristics were suggestive for high FDG activity in the lung despite the lack of respiratory symptoms. CONCLUSION: The SARS CoV-2 viral infection in asymptomatic cancer patients is a very rare possibility, but represents a challenging scenario both for the differential diagnosis in cancer and also for the epidemiologic context.","Piciu, Andra; Manole, Simona; Piciu, Doina; Dreve, Teodora; Roman, Andrei",Med Pharm Rep,576,15

This includes the shutdown of the host cellular protein synthesis, which abrogates the induction of antiviral interferon responses. The virus initiates the infection of susceptible cells by binding with its spike protein (S) to the host angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Here we applied the T cell receptor fusion construct (TRuC) technology to engineer T cells against such infected cells. In our TRuCs an S-binding domain is fused to the CD3ε component of the T cell receptor (TCR) complex, enabling recognition of S-containing cells in an HLA independent manner. This domain either consists of the S-binding part of ACE2 or a single-chain variable fragment of an anti-S antibody. We show that the TRuC T cells are activated by and kill cells that express S of SARS-CoV-2 and its alpha (B.1.1.7) and beta (B.1.351) variants at the cell surface. Treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infected cells with our engineered T cells did not lead to massive cytotoxicity towards the infected cells, but resulted in a complete rescue of the translational shutdown despite ongoing viral replication. Our data show that engineered TRuC T cell products might be used against SARS-CoV-2 by exposing infected cells to the host innate immune system.","Godbole, Ira; Ciminski, Kevin; Yousefi, O.

The blockade of SIV by IFITMs is isolate specific, raising the question of which parameters impact sensitivity to IFITM. We show that the virion context in which SIV-Env is presented and the efficiency of virion incorporation determine Env susceptibility to inhibition by IFITMs. Thus, determinants other than the nature of the envelope protein can impact the IFITM sensitivity of viral entry. IMPORTANCE The host cell-encoded IFITM proteins can block viral entry and are an important component of the innate defenses against viral infection. However, the determinants controlling whether a virus is susceptible to blockade by IFITM proteins are incompletely understood. Our study shows that the amount of envelope proteins incorporated into virions as well as the nature of the virion particle itself can impact the sensitivity of viral entry to IFITMs. These results show for the first time that determinants other than the viral envelope protein can impact sensitivity to IFITM and have implications for the interpretation of previously published data on inhibition of viruses by IFITM proteins. Moreover, our findings might help to define the mechanism underlying the antiviral activity of IFITM proteins.","Wrensch, Florian; Hoffmann, Markus; Gärtner, Sabine; Nehlmeier, Inga; Winkler, Michael; Pöhlmann, Stefan",J Virol,576,1

In an attempt to continue to probe “essentiality,” this article coins the term “essential crimes” to refer to those socially injurious acts and omissions that are part and parcel of a global neoliberal capitalist order, and that are, therefore, vital to keep the socioeconomic system running. In other words, if keeping humans alive in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic required supermarkets and hospitals to remain open (“essential business and jobs”), maintaining the existing socioeconomic system and ensuring that the powerful remained powerful required harmful acts and omissions by states and corporations—what we refer to as “essential crimes.” This article sheds light on how the COVID-19 pandemic has helped illuminate just how essential these crimes and harms are to the perpetuation of the status quo by the powerful. In addition, this article encourages us to consider which punishments, if any, are vital to a well-ordered society, and it demands that we rethink whether prison is an “essential punishment” for ensuring public safety.","Vegh Weis, Valeria; Magnin, Brittany",Crit Criminol,576,1

However, age groupings used to record and report health data vary greatly, hindering the harmonisation, comparability, and usefulness of these data, within and across countries. This variability has become especially evident during the COVID-19 pandemic, when there was an urgent need for rapid cross-country analyses of epidemiological patterns by age to direct public health action, but such analyses were limited by the lack of standard age categories. In this Personal View, we propose a recommended set of age groupings to address this issue. These groupings are informed by age-specific patterns of morbidity, mortality, and health risks, and by opportunities for prevention and disease intervention. We recommend age groupings of 5 years for all health data, except for those younger than 5 years, during which time there are rapid biological and physiological changes that justify a finer disaggregation. Although the focus of this Personal View is on the standardisation of the analysis and display of age groups, we also outline the challenges faced in collecting data on exact age, especially for health facilities and surveillance data.

PURPOSE: To evaluate the French national experience using Chest CT for COVID-19, results of chest CT and RT-PCR were compared together and with the final discharge diagnosis used as reference standard. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A structured CT scan survey (NCT04339686) was sent to 26 hospital radiology departments in France between March 2 and April 24 2020. These dates correspond to the peak of the national COVID-19 epidemic. Radiology departments were selected to reflect the estimated geographical prevalence heterogeneities of the epidemic. All symptomatic patients suspected of having a COVID-19 pneumonia who underwent within 48 hours both initial chest CT and at least one RT-PCR testing were included. The final discharge diagnosis, based on multiparametric items, was recorded. Data for each center were prospectively collected and gathered each week. Test efficacy was determined by using Mann-Whitney Test, Student’s t-test, Chi-square test and Pearson’s correlation. A p value <.05 determined statistical significance. RESULTS: Twenty-six of 26 hospital radiology departments responded to the survey with 7500 patients entered; 2652 did not have RT-PCR results or had unknown or excess delay between RT-PCR and CT. After exclusions, 4824 patients (mean age 64, ± 19 yrs, 2669 males) were included. Using final diagnosis as the reference, 2564 of the 4824 patients were positive for COVID-19 (53%).

In several European countries including Italy, the increase in the number of COVID-19 cases has followed a consistent, exponential pattern of spread. However, some countries, notably Taiwan and Hong Kong, have achieved a different outcome and have managed to bring the COVID-19 outbreak in their countries rapidly under control, without entering the exponential pattern and with very few cases. They have used several different approaches to COVID-19 outbreak control, including the innovative use of smartphone technology and the widespread use of surgical face masks. We show through our models, that Canada has followed the same, consistent COVID-19 exponential growth pattern that is seen in Italy. Both nationally and in its most heavily affected provinces, there is exponential growth of COVID-19 cases, making it possible to make predictions for the future, if no further interventions are made in public health policy.

The results showed that 92.2% of the participants had a high knowledge level regarding COVID-19 prevention measures, 68.6% had a positive attitude toward COVID-19 prevention measures, and 75.8% practiced all six measures for preventing the spread of the virus. Age, sex, marital status, knowledge, and fear were significantly associated with the practices aimed at COVID-19 prevention. Married people and participants with high levels of knowledge were more likely to practice all preventive measures. In contrast, young people, men, and those who fear COVID-19 were less likely to practice all preventative measures. Good KAP among Vietnamese people could be an important factor in helping authorities gain initial success in containing the coronavirus and COVID-19. In addition to continuously raising and maintaining the community's awareness, attitude, and practices in disease prevention, the introduction and strict implementation of sanctions and regulations were also important in ensuring good practices were implemented and sustained over time.
