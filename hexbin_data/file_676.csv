However, a major concern for the use of ICIs after alloHCT is the increased risk of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). We analyzed the association between GVHD prophylaxis and frequency of GVHD in patients who had received ICI therapy after alloHCT. METHODS: A retrospective study was performed in 21 patients with acute myeloid leukemia (n=16) or myelodysplastic syndromes (n=5) who were treated with antiprogrammed cell death protein 1 (16 patients) or anticytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 (5 patients) therapy for disease relapse after alloHCT. Associations between the type of GVHD prophylaxis and incidence of GVHD were analyzed. RESULTS: Four patients (19%) developed acute GVHD. The incidence of acute GVHD was associated only with the type of post-transplantation GVHD prophylaxis; none of the other variables included (stem cell source, donor type, age at alloHCT, conditioning regimen and prior history of GVHD) were associated with the frequency of acute GVHD. Twelve patients received post-transplantation cyclophosphamide (PTCy) for GVHD prophylaxis. Patients who received PTCy had a significantly shorter median time to initiation of ICI therapy after alloHCT compared with patients who did not receive PTCy (median 5.1 months compared with 26.6 months). Despite early ICI therapy initiation, patients who received PTCy had a lower observed cumulative incidence of grades 2–4 acute GVHD compared with patients who did not receive PTCy (16% compared with 22%; p=0.7). After controlling for comorbidities and time from alloHCT to ICI therapy initiation, the analysis showed that PTCy was associated with a 90% reduced risk of acute GVHD (HR 0.1, 95% CI 0.02 to 0.6, p=0.01). CONCLUSIONS: ICI therapy for relapsed acute myeloid leukemia/myelodysplastic syndromes after alloHCT may be a safe and feasible option. PTCy appears to decrease the incidence of acute GVHD in this cohort of patients.","Saberian, Chantal; Abdel-Wahab, Noha; Abudayyeh, Ala; Rafei, Hind; Joseph, Jacinth; Rondon, Gabriela; Whited, Laura; Gruschkus, Stephen; Fa'ak, Faisal; Daher, May; Knape, Cristina; Safa, Houssein; Shoukier, Mahran; Suarez-Almazor, Maria E; Marcotulli, Megan; Ludford, Kaysia; Gulbis, Alison M; Konopleva, Marina; Ohanian, Maro; Ravandi, Farhad; Garcia-Manero, Guillermo; Oran, Betul; Popat, Uday R; Mehta, Rotesh; Alousi, Amin M; Daver, Naval; Champlin, Richard; Diab, Adi; Al-Atrash, Gheath",J Immunother Cancer,676,1

During the development of cirrhosis, the formation of collagenous scar tissue is paralleled by a reorganization and remodeling of the hepatic vascular system. To date, macrovascular remodeling in various cirrhosis models has been examined using three-dimensional (3D) imaging modalities, while microvascular changes have been studied mainly by two-dimensional (2D) light microscopic and electron microscopic imaging. Here, we report on the application of high-resolution 3D synchrotron radiation-based microtomography (SRμCT) for the study of the sinusoidal and capillary blood vessel system in three murine models of advanced parenchymal and biliary hepatic fibrosis. SRμCT facilitates the characterization of microvascular architecture and identifies features of intussusceptive angiogenesis in progressive liver fibrosis in a non-destructive 3D manner.","Wagner, Willi L.; Föhst, Sonja; Hock, Jessica; Kim, Yong Ook; Popov, Yury; Schuppan, Detlef; Schladitz, Katja; Redenbach, Claudia; Ackermann, Maximilian",Angiogenesis,676,1

Prior work suggests that anti-TNF therapy may reduce all-cause mortality compared with prolonged corticosteroid use among Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries with IBD. OBJECTIVE: To examine the association between use of anti-TNF or corticosteroids and all-cause mortality in a national cohort of veterans with IBD. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cohort study used a well-established Veteran’s Health Administration cohort of 2997 patients with IBD treated with prolonged corticosteroids (≥3000-mg prednisone equivalent and/or ≥600 mg of budesonide within a 12-month period) and/or new anti-TNF therapy from January 1, 2006, to October 1, 2015. Data were analyzed between July 1, 2019, and December 31, 2020. EXPOSURES: Use of corticosteroids or anti-TNF. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary end point was all-cause mortality as defined by the Veterans Health Administration vital status file. Marginal structural modeling was used to compare associations between anti-TNF therapy or corticosteroid use and all-cause mortality. RESULTS: A total of 2997 patients (2725 men [90.9%]; mean [SD] age, 50.0 [17.4] years) were included in the final analysis, 1734 (57.9%) with Crohn disease (CD) and 1263 (42.1%) with ulcerative colitis (UC). All-cause mortality was 8.5% (n = 256) over a mean (SD) of 3.9 (2.3) years’ follow-up. At cohort entry, 1836 patients were new anti-TNF therapy users, and 1161 were prolonged corticosteroid users. Anti-TNF therapy use was associated with a lower likelihood of mortality for CD (odds ratio [OR], 0.54; 95% CI, 0.31-0.93) but not for UC (OR, 0.33; 95% CI, 0.10-1.10). In a sensitivity analysis adjusting prolonged corticosteroid users to include patients receiving corticosteroids within 90 to 270 days after initiation of anti-TNF therapy, the OR for UC was statistically significant, at 0.33 (95% CI, 0.13-0.84), and the OR for CD was 0.55 (95% CI, 0.33-0.92). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This study suggests that anti-TNF therapy may be associated with reduced mortality compared with long-term corticosteroid use among veterans with CD, and potentially among those with UC.","Cohen-Mekelburg, Shirley; Wallace, Beth I.; Van, Tony; Wiitala, Wyndy L.; Govani, Shail M.; Burns, Jennifer; Lipson, Rachel; Yun, Huifeng; Hou, Jason; Lewis, James D.; Dominitz, Jason A.; Waljee, Akbar K.",JAMA Netw Open,676,1

As the nations prepare to meet this threat, public health interventions are being carefully gauged within the context of influenza epidemiology, populations, and healthcare systems. A pandemic will place enormous demands on healthcare systems that include at the center of planning efforts the protection of healthcare workers. During an influenza pandemic, healthcare workers will be on the front lines delivering care to patients and preventing further spread of the disease. Protecting these workers from acquiring or transmitting infection in the hospital ward and outside the workplace is critical to containing a pandemic and limiting morbidity and mortality of the population. Several approaches to protecting healthcare workers include vaccination, antiviral 10.1007/978-0-387-78665-0_6443, use of personal protective equipment, and adherence to other infection control practices. In the absence of vaccination, application of antiviral drugs has been rationalized as the first-line defense against the 10.1007/978-0-387-78665-0_6288. While the treatment of ill individuals is top priority in most national contingency plans, the use of drugs as prophylaxis has been debatable. This chapter attempts to highlight the importance of a competent healthcare system in response to an influenza pandemic, and presents the conflicting issues that are surrounding an antiviral prophylaxis strategy. An overview of potential benefits and limitations, logistical constraints, and clinical and epidemiological consequences of healthcare worker prophylaxis is also provided.","Moghadas, S.

There are various possible triggers associated with the development of AHE such as Upper Respiratory Tract related infections which have been reported in the literature. A typical case of AHE is a child less than 2 years of age having the symptoms of fever, Acral Targetoid Purpura, and Edema. The course of this illness is benign with a complete resolution within few weeks. This case report involves a patient having the classical symptoms of fever, Purpura and Edema, but with an unusual extensive truncal involvement. Moreover, Rhinovirus infection testing was positive in the child’s case. The presence of the virus gives a suspicion of being the possible trigger for the boy’s AHE. In the previous hospital, the treatment started with steroid for a course of one week without a significant improvement which brought the patients to the Emergency department. A decision of continuing a supportive treatment led to a complete resolution. After 3 weeks the AHE symptoms were gone without any complications.","Al Murayshid, Abdurrahman Ibrahim",,676,1

This trend culminated when three torrents coincided at a common confluence, fusing into a single channel of much greater velocity: the surge of populist politics, the spread of conspiracy theories and the avalanche of misinformation boosted by changes in the media. Nativist populist leaders in the new digital media environment were able to spread conspiracy theories and misinformation much further than before, crafting an especially successful recipe for undermining the political establishment. In essence, this book provides a broad overview of modern political history in Europe and in America. It covers some of the most contested phenomena in contemporary politics, focusing on nationalism, populism and right-wing extremism. Perhaps most vitally the book documents a turn away from liberal democracy established in the post-war era, and towards more authoritative illiberal modes of democracy.","Bergmann, Eirikur",Neo-Nationalism,676,1

Each wave occurred in the wake of crisis or major social change, and each grew stronger than the one before. All are identifiable by their own qualities and characteristics, which here are analysed. The first wave arose in the wake of the Oil Crisis of the early 1970s and the second after the collapse of communism. The third wave rose most clearly in opposition to migration—mainly against Muslims settling in the West. This introductory chapter sets the stage for the study at hand, which is to map the rebirth of nationalism in Europe and America since the Second World War, which has taken on a populist form. The chapter lays the foundation for the book’s main investigation into how contemporary nativist populism has travelled in waves, and risen on the canopies of crises.","Bergmann, Eirikur",Neo-Nationalism,676,1

This study sought to characterize the epidemiology of human rickettsioses amongst patients hospitalized with fever at 8 tertiary hospitals in Indonesia. METHODS: Acute and convalescent blood from 975 hospitalized non-dengue patients was tested for Rickettsia IgM and IgG by ELISA. Specimens from cases with seroconversion or increasing IgM and/or IgG titers were tested for Rickettsia IgM and IgG by IFA and Rickettsia genomes using primers for Rickettsia (R.) sp, R. typhi, and Orientia tsutsugamushi. Testing was performed retrospectively on stored specimens; results did not inform patient management. RESULTS: R. typhi, R. rickettsii, and O. tsutsugamushi IgG antibodies were identified in 269/872 (30.8%), 36/634 (5.7%), and 19/504 (3.8%) of samples, respectively. For the 103/975 (10.6%) non-dengue patients diagnosed with acute rickettsial infection, presenting symptoms included nausea (72%), headache (69%), vomiting (43%), lethargy (33%), anorexia (32%), arthralgia (30%), myalgia (28%), chills (28%), epigastric pain (28%), and rash (17%). No acute rickettsioses cases were suspected during hospitalization. Discharge diagnoses included typhoid fever (44), dengue fever (20), respiratory infections (7), leptospirosis (6), unknown fever (6), sepsis (5), hepatobiliary infections (3), UTI (3), and others (9). Fatalities occurred in 7 (6.8%) patients, mostly with co-morbidities. CONCLUSIONS: Rickettsial infections are consistently misdiagnosed, often as leptospirosis, dengue, or Salmonella typhi infection. Clinicians should include rickettsioses in their differential diagnosis of fever to guide empiric management; laboratories should support evaluation for rickettsial etiologies; and public policy should be implemented to reduce burden of disease.","Lokida, Dewi; Hadi, Usman; Lau, Chuen-Yen; Kosasih, Herman; Liang, C.

Failures as well as successes abound, but several methods have been improved and new approaches are on the horizon. Many freshwater fish and plant invaders have been eliminated, especially by chemical and physical methods for fishes and herbicides for plants. Efforts to maintain invasive freshwater fishes at low levels have sometimes succeeded, although continuing the effort has proven challenging. By contrast, successful maintenance management of invasive freshwater plants is uncommon, although populations of several species have been managed by biological control. Invasive crayfish populations have rarely been controlled for long. Marine invasions have proven far less tractable than those in fresh water, with a few striking eradications of species detected before they had spread widely, and no marine invasions have been substantially managed for long at low levels. The rapid development of technologies based on genetics has engendered excitement about possibly eradicating or controlling terrestrial invaders, and such technologies may also prove useful for certain aquatic invaders. Methods of particular interest, alone or in various combinations, are gene-silencing, RNA-guided gene drives, and the use of transgenes.","Simberloff, Daniel",Hydrobiologia,676,1

COVID-19 spread and is now a global pandemic. With few exceptions, countries in the Northern hemisphere have higher mortality rates from COVID-19. This may be due to an increased prevalence of older people in Northern Europe at higher risk of having cardio-pulmonary and metabolic comorbidities as well as hypovitaminosis D. With increasing age, immunosenescence and ‘inflammaging’ lead to impaired and maladaptive immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 infections, contributing to the enhanced prevalence of severe COVID-19 in older patients. The association of ageing with increased vitamin D deficiency, which is associated with cardiovascular risk factors and disease and worse prognosis in COVID-19 infection, is discussed. Considerable experimental evidence demonstrates the immuno-modulatory properties of vitamin D, in particular, its role in regulating and suppressing the inflammatory cytokine response to viral respiratory infections links the importance of vitamin D sufficiency as a potential protective factor in COVID-19. There is an urgent need for prospective randomised studies to examine whether hypovitaminosis D correlates with severity of COVID-19 disease and the actual benefit of repletion. Moreover, given what has been described as a ‘pandemic of vitamin D deficiency’, especially in Europe, and in the context of the SARS-CoV-2 contagion, the authors support the call for public health doctors and physicians, with support from Governments, to prioritise and strengthen recommendations on vitamin D intake and supplementation.","O'Shea, Paula M.; Griffin, Tomás P.; Brennan, Michelle; Mulkerrin, Eamon C.",J Nutr Sci,676,1

Modern speedy development in medical and computational growth in the field of the central nervous system enables practitioners and researchers to extract and visualize insight from these systems. The function of augmented reality is to incorporate virtual and real objects, interactively running in a real-time and real environment. The role of augmented reality in the central nervous system becomes a thought-provoking task. Gesture interaction approach-based augmented reality in the central nervous system has enormous impending for reducing the care cost, quality refining of care, and waste and error reducing. To make this process smooth, it would be effective to present a comprehensive study report of the available state-of-the-art-work for enabling doctors and practitioners to easily use it in the decision making process. This comprehensive study will finally summarise the outputs of the published materials associate to gesture interaction-based augmented reality approach in the central nervous system. This research uses the protocol of systematic literature which systematically collects, analyses, and derives facts from the collected papers. The data collected range from the published materials for 10 years. 78 papers were selected and included papers based on the predefined inclusion, exclusion, and quality criteria. The study supports to identify the studies related to augmented reality in the nervous system, application of augmented reality in the nervous system, technique of augmented reality in the nervous system, and the gesture interaction approaches in the nervous system.

To unfold the paradox of the R&D spillover effect spared in the global supply chain, we use computable general equilibrium model with the GTAP database v10 to analyze the impact of Japan’s public R&D investment to the world focus on key sectors of global supply chain, namely chemical and pharmaceutical, electronic equipment, machinery, and transportation equipment to examine its output, external trades, and welfare. The productivity parameters triggered by public R&D investment are calibrated from the SciREX Policymaking Intelligent Assistance System—Economic Simulator (SPIAS-e). The simulation results show significant increase in Japan’s output and export for chemical and pharmaceutical, electronic equipment, and transportation equipment. The GDP growth was stimulated by 0.6% and substantial welfare improvement by USD 78,000 million, while other countries such as Malaysia and Taiwan by 0.4–0.6%. In contrast, the economic indicators of China reveal a negative impact, implying a structural change in the composition of the production network. It is notable to see a higher economic integration of Oceania within the region through its vibrant production and trades. The study provides comprehensive global analysis on production networks and insights for evaluating the R&D investment spillover effects.","Huang, Michael C.; Liou, Ming-Huan; Iwaki, Yoko",J,676,1

Since it remains one of the leading causes of mortality worldwide, numerous drug candidates have already been tested, and continue to be developed, as potential adjunct therapies. Despite convincing mechanisms of action and robust pre-clinical data, almost all drug candidates in the field of sepsis have failed to demonstrate clinical efficacy in the past two decades. Accordingly, the development of new sepsis drugs has markedly decreased in the past few years. Nevertheless, thanks to a better understanding of sepsis pathophysiology and pathways, new promising drug candidates are currently being developed. Instead of a unique sepsis profile as initially suspected, various phenotypes have been characterised. This has resulted in the identification of multiple targets for new drugs together with relevant biomarkers, and a better understanding of the most appropriate time to intervention. Within the entire sepsis drugs portfolio, those targeting the immune response are probably the most promising. Monoclonal antibodies targeting either cytokines or infectious agents are undoubtedly part of the potential successful therapeutic classes to come.","Vignon, Philippe; Laterre, Pierre-François; Daix, Thomas; François, Bruno",Drugs,676,1

Objectives The current study has estimated the incidence; risk factors and outcomes of subjects with acute kidney injury developed during admission to the intensive care unit at Fedail Hospital, Khartoum, Sudan. Methodology This was a cross-sectional study conducted in the intensive care unit during the period from July 2018 to June 2019. The data was collected from the clinical profiles of all adult subjects’ who have met the published criteria for acute kidney injury. Analysis of association (Chi square test χ(2)) and multivariate logistic regression were used to analyze data. Main outcome measure The development of acute kidney injury during the subjects’ stay in the intensive care unit, length of hospital stay and death. Results From a total of 187 subjects admitted to the intensive care unit; only (105, 56.2%) have met the inclusion criteria (mean age was 61 ± 3.5 years). The main finding of the study was the high incidence of acute kidney injury 39%. The major significant predictors for the development of acute kidney injury with respective odds ratio (OR) were: sepsis (OR 7.5 [95% CI 3–19.7]; P .001); hypovolemia (OR 5.1 [95% CI 2–15.7]; P .001); chronic cardiovascular diseases (OR 3.4 [95% CI 1.2–9.4]; P .017); age > 60 years (OR 2.7 [95% CI 1.2–6.3]; P .018); diabetes mellitus (OR 2.6 [95% CI 1.2–6]; P .02); hypertension (OR 2.4 [95% CI 1.2–5.4]; P .028); and renal replacement therapy (OR 0.2 [95% CI 0.15–0.3]; P .001). The length of hospital stay within the AKI cohort was (6.7 ± 3.8; [range 2–17]) and the mortality rate was (36, 87.8%). Conclusion The major significant predictors for the development of acute kidney injury in the intensive care unit were: sepsis; hypovolemia; chronic cardiovascular diseases; age > 60 years; diabetes mellitus; hypertension; and renal replacement therapy. Sepsis and hypovolemia were common etiologies for acute kidney injury post-admission to the intensive care unit. Acute kidney injury was associated with increased length of hospital stay and a very high absolute mortality rate.","Magboul, Salma Mohammed; Osman, Bashier; Elnour, Asim Ahmed",Int J Clin Pharm,676,1

Since the outbreak of the pandemic, the use of AI in the healthcare sector has been largely evident. This chapter provides a detailed analysis regarding the use of AI technology in the healthcare sector and identifies its contributions in the fighting against the deadly pandemic, i.e. COVID-19. Discussion regarding the challenges in the AI technology is further provided. Following the analysis, it has been revealed that AI is effective and contributes under six areas; including the production of early warnings and alerts, tracking and prediction, data bash boards, diagnosis and prognosis, information related to treatment and cures resulting in controlling the widespread of the disease. In broader terms, AI is effective and can be used to identify and analyze patterns in complex and large data sets in a more precise time and high speed which was never done before. It is further useful in providing a thorough search related to the literary studies conducted previously regarding the development of different drugs. Furthermore, manufacturing of drugs is held through robots designed by the infusion of the AI technology for fast and quick delivery of services. Contributions of AI when used in the healthcare industry is further important to search out patients that are suitable for the clinical studies. AI due to its fast-tracking systems is further effective in reducing the workload of radiologists, since it is capable of reading the radiological reports through deep learning and machine learning systems. These scans can be stored for some time and are available when required in order to train the AI systems. AI through its fast-tracking quality, allows cost and time effective functions by quickly analyzing a number of scans resulting in providing better treatment to patients. In the healthcare sector, AI has shown promising results by detecting conditions such as; pneumonia, skin cancer, eye diseases etc. Also, most hospitals used AI technologies to analyze echocardiography scans, ultra sound system, neurological conditions, speech patterns or to predict the psychotic episodes. Many surgical robotics are being designed to assist clinical experts in surgical processes. In the prevailing diseases like pandemic, AI technology-based robots are used by various countries for medication and routine checkup purposes in order to reduce the chances of doctors being affected by the disease contact. However, in the existing crisis the role of AI has been limited since only limited countries were able to install the AI technology which has limited its impact in controlling the virus. Besides, the lack of data in providing the accurate predictions regarding the spread of disease was another major gap in reducing the overall impact of the disease. Overcoming these barriers and limitations are effective in developing the right balance between public health and data privacy leading towards the development of human based AI interactions. These gaps will likely to address the issues faced in the time of the present pandemic situation, as by gathering extensive data related to the infected population countries will be able to save thousands of lives, through prior preparations.","AL-Hashimi, Mukhtar; Hamdan, Allam",The Importance of New Technologies and Entrepreneurship in Business Development: In The Context of Economic Diversity in Developing Countries,676,31

This has resulted in impacting society, institutions, Government, and Students themselves. This paper investigates the issues relating to dropouts and also looks at how the pieces of evidence are co-related. It is observed through the findings of a research work carried out in USA and UAE (Sample of eighty five students at each location using multi variate tests analysis) that students without a strategic perspective as well as a non-commitment to education end up having a very poor academic performance. This has a knock-on impact, not only in terms of completion success rates but also demonstrating a high risk of discontinuing or abandoning the degree. Therefore academic performance along with the aspect of practical/experiential learning is a key variable in getting the students to decide their future course of action, which is either to stay or drop out. This paper has adopted a three steps approach in its methodology to identify factors leading to high educational dropouts. They being, student-oriented factors, institution oriented factors, family-oriented factors, community, and social media-oriented factors. Articles were examined based on open coding content analysis to further assess the quality of the facts and data provided.

However, there are limited tools in assessing readability of Arabic reading materials. Thus, the lack of measuring tools to assess the suitability of textbooks amongst non-native speakers is a constraint which led to this study. In this regard, this paper discusses the efforts to develop a readability formula for Arabic reading materials in Malaysia. This study involved 313 samples of population from thirteen Arabic textbooks used in religious secondary schools in Malaysia. A linguistic analysis is performed as well as an inference analysis to see the strength of the relationship of each linguistic pattern with the level of readability. The findings show that the relationship between the linguistic features that is being analysed is not strong. But this finding can be used as the basic formula for improvement. This is because the textbooks that have been sampled do not have good writing features. Thus, a comprehensive effort is needed to ensure the preparation of Arabic language textbook is of good quality for non-native students.","Ghani, Kamarulzaman Abdul; Noh, Ahmad Sabri; Yusoff, Nik Mohd Rahimi Nik; Hussein, Nur Hafezah",The Importance of New Technologies and Entrepreneurship in Business Development: In The Context of Economic Diversity in Developing Countries,676,1

Investors have greater belief when they consider a company external information (as a company’s macroeconomics information) and MEG’s time information (as forward-looking future-oriented information) in earnings announcement than a single reference point only, which in turn, influences their judgments in evaluating company’s performance. This study also presents evidence that investors have greater anchor when a company’s macroeconomics is considered in earnings announcements than do when they are given internal information only. Overall, the experimental results suggest that company external (as a company’s macroeconomics information) and MEG disclosure (as forward-looking future-oriented information) in earnings announcement, effectively help investors in evaluating company’s performance. Moreover, this study shows that MEG disclosure, besides earnings announcement, and external information, have information contents, that investors use these multiple reference points of information to predict a company’s performance in the future.","Wahyuni, Sri; Hartono, Jogiyanto",The Importance of New Technologies and Entrepreneurship in Business Development: In The Context of Economic Diversity in Developing Countries,676,1

Current conventional banking based RBSFs fail to capture these specificities, which this new RBSF aims to bridge. The fast-growing systemic importance of the Islamic banking industry in various jurisdictions around the globe warrants effective supervision that recognises their specificities. The new RBSF gives a more accurate assessment of Islamic banks’ health (risk profile) which ensures more effective risk-based supervision of Islamic banks in a bid to improving their safety and soundness to promote overall financial system stability. The methodology adopted has been a qualitative approach through both content analysis of the current RBSF in Nigeria to identify gaps and a semi-structured interview (analysed with Atlas ti-8) to obtain expert recommendations on developing the new RBSF tailored for Islamic banks in Nigeria. The expected contribution of the Framework proposed by this study is that Islamic banks will be better supervised by regulators which will lead to safer Islamic banks and in turn promote the safety and soundness of the financial system at large. The study will also aid Islamic banks to better understand and manage the unique risks inherent in their line of business (Islamic banking). This paper also contributes to alleviating the current shortage of academic literature on the crucial regulatory subject of risk-based supervision in the Islamic finance industry.","Dalhatu, Suleiman Sani; Sharofiddin, Ashurov",The Importance of New Technologies and Entrepreneurship in Business Development: In The Context of Economic Diversity in Developing Countries,676,1

Upgrading of informal settlements can improve urban services and infrastructure, strengthen tenure security, and empower local communities. This chapter examines the conceptual and practice relationships between climate resilience and in-situ upgrading. It critiques prevailing approaches, which centre upon threshold, coping, recovery, and adaptive capacities. Transformative capacity offers greater scope for addressing climate change impacts at a level commensurate with the size of the challenge, and for redressing the entrenched structural inequalities and deep socio-spatial injustices shaping cities in the Global South that perpetuate vulnerability and socio-spatial exclusion. Five elements are identified to advance transformative informal settlement upgrading: socio-technical innovation; a climate justice framing; greater attention to intersectional dimensions; inclusive governance and community empowerment; and fit for purpose finance.","French, Matthew; Trundle, Alexei; Korte, Inga; Koto, Camari",Climate Resilient Urban Areas,676,31

As a result, no recreational or sport activities are allowed outside the (often small) boundaries of family homes, a situation often rapidly introducing social isolation. Research has proven that emotional coping mechanisms, such as sport, can lower the stressful and uncertainty burden on individuals. However, without the availability of this coping mechanism, many individuals have been forced to use virtual sport training technology to keep active. This preliminary quantitative study investigated the role of technology, in particular virtual sport training technology (if any) by cyclists as emotional coping mechanism during a period of national lockdown. The results of an online survey indicated that sport, in general, has always been an emotional coping mechanism during normal challenging situations but that slightly more respondents used sport as mechanism during the lockdown period. Respondents indicated that virtual cycling training technology enabled them to continue with using their normal coping mechanism even in a period of national lockdown. One of the benefits of a virtual training environment is the ability to socialize by riding with virtual team members. Surprisingly, the number of cyclists who preferred riding alone in the virtual cycling environment was slightly more than the cyclists who preferred to join scheduled rides with virtual team members.

Some recent indoor navigation systems allow users equipped with smartphones to interact with low cost Bluetooth-based beacons deployed strategically within the indoor space of interest to navigate their surroundings. A major challenge in deploying such beacon-based navigation systems is the need to employ a time and labor-expensive beacon planning process to identify potential beacon placement locations and arrive at a topological structure representing the indoor space. This work presents a technique called IBeaconMap for creating such topological structures to use with beacon-based navigation that only needs the floor plans of the indoor spaces of interest.","Cheraghi, Seyed Ali; Namboodiri, Vinod; Sinha, Kaushik",Computers Helping People with Special Needs,676,13

We argue that sentiment analysis is well suited to study an important topic in digital sociology: affective publics. Specifically, sentiment analysis reveals useful to explore two key components of affective publics: a) structure (emergence of dominant emotions); b) dynamics (transformation of affectivity into emotions). To do that we suggest combining sentiment analysis with emotion detection, text analysis and social media engagement metrics – which help to better understand the semantic and social context in which the sentiment related to a specific issue is situated. To illustrate our methodological point, we draw on the analysis of 33,338 tweets containing two hashtags – #NHSHeroes and #Covidiot – emerged in response to the global pandemic caused by Covid-19. Drawing on the analysis of the two affective publics aggregating around #NHSHeroes and #Covidiot, we conclude that they reflect a blend of emotions. In some cases, such generic flow of affect coalesces into a dominant emotion while it may not necessarily occur in other instances. Affective publics structured around positive emotions and local issues tend to be more consistent and cohesive than those based on general issues and negative emotions. Although negative emotions might attract the attention of digital publics, positively framed messages engage users more.","Rathnayake, Chamil; Caliandro, Alessandro","Diversity, Divergence, Dialogue",676,7

Hence, the idea of “green self-sufficiency” at the local, neighbourhood and sub-neighbourhood level has emerged as a relevant objective to pursue. For this purpose, we have constructed a high-fidelity evaluation model to assess the walking accessibility of UPGS at the highly granular spatial scale of street network nodes. The evaluation procedure is based on a novel index constructed around the concept of distance-cumulative deficit, scoring nodes with respect to all the available UPGS within their catchment area of slope-corrected walking distance of 2 km. To showcase the possible outputs of the evaluation procedure and their exploratory analyses, we present an application on the city of Cagliari, Italy. In doing that, we argue that the proposed evaluation approach is an advancement over the traditional (density-based) approaches of assessment of green area availability, and that it provides an intuitive, flexible and extendable tool useful to better evaluate and understand the current and the potential accessibility of urban green space, and to support urban planning, policy making and design.","Blečić, Ivan; Saiu, Valeria; Trunfio, Giuseppe A.",Computational Science and Its Applications - ICCSA 2020,676,7

Accordingly, some maps, useful to read the playing urban growth dynamics, were generated and some applications proposed. Nevertheless some limitations still persist: the proposed methodology is based on simplified hypotheses, mainly related to the definition of spatial indices that somehow depend on the type of information that available maps contain.

To date, there is no validation analysis in literature focusing on the comparability of such products, not even in relation to the use of workflows commonly allowed inside various software platforms. The lack of detailed information about the algorithms implemented in the licensed platforms makes the whole interpretation even more complex.

A point cloud, having an average density of 7 pt/m(2) and covering 14 km(2) was generated, filtered and regularized to generate the correspondent DSM (Digital Surface Model) with a grid size of 0.5 m. With reference to the above-mentioned ICE DTM, a Canopy Height Model (CHM) was generated by grid differencing with a grid size of 0.5 m. A true-orthoimage was also generated having a GSD of 0.5 m. The latter was used to map burned areas by a pixel based unsupervised classification approach operating with reference to the pseudo GNDVI image, previously computed from the native red and green bands (no radiometric calibration was applied aimed at converting back the raw digital numbers to reflectance). Results were compared with 2 official datasets that were generated after the event from satellite data, one produced by the Piemonte Region and the other one by the Copernicus Emergency System. In order to test differences between burned and not-burned areas, point density, point spacing and canopy heights were computed and compared looking for evidences of geometrical differences possibly characterizing burned areas in respect of the not burned ones. Results showed that no significant differences were found between point density and point spacing in burned and not burned area. There was a significant difference in CHM minimum values distribution between burned and not-burned areas while maximum values distribution does not change significantly, proving that fire change crown structure but tree height remain unchanged. These results suggest that aerial photogrammetry could detect fire effect on forest having higher accuracy respect to ordinary approaches used in forest disturbance ecology.","De Petris, S.; Momo, E.

Due to limited resources, it is no longer feasible to persistently store all that data which leads to massive data streams. In order to meet the requirements of modern businesses, techniques have been developed to deal with these massive data streams. These include complex event processing (CEP) and data stream mining, which are covered in this article. Along with the development of these techniques, many terms and semantic overloads have occurred, making it difficult to clearly distinguish techniques for processing massive data streams. In this article, CEP and data stream mining are distinguished and compared to clarify terms and semantic overloads.","Lange, Moritz; Koschel, Arne; Astrova, Irina",Computational Science and Its Applications - ICCSA 2020,676,7

Volumetric Modulated Arc Therapy (VMAT), one of the most efficient RT arc techniques, particularly with respect to dose delivery time, has recently considered noncoplanar arc trajectories while irradiating the patient, thanks to technological advances in the most recent generation of RT systems. In a preliminary work we have proposed a two-step optimization approach for noncoplanar arc trajectory optimization (ATO). In this paper, treatment plans considering 5-, 7-, 9-, 11- and 21-beam ensembles in the first step (optimal selection of noncoplanar irradiation directions) of the proposed approach are compared to assess the trade-offs between treatment quality and computational time required to obtain a noncoplanar VMAT plan. The different strategies were tested resorting to a head-and-neck tumor case already treated at the Portuguese Institute of Oncology of Coimbra (IPOC). Results obtained presented similar treatment quality for the different strategies. However, strategies that consider a reduced number of beams in the first step clearly outperform the other strategies in terms of computational times. Results show that for a similar tumor coverage, treatment plans with optimal beam irradiation directions obtained an enhanced organ sparing.","Rocha, Humberto; Dias, Joana; Carrasqueira, Pedro; Ventura, Tiago; Ferreira, Brígida; Lopes, Maria do Carmo",Computational Science and Its Applications - ICCSA 2020,676,7

The heat treatment furnaces used for reheating equipment made of steel require a good regulator to control the temperature at each stage of the process, thereby optimizing resources. Considering dynamic and variable temperature behavior inside the oven, this paper proposes the design of a temperature controller based on a Takagi-Sugeno-Kang (TSK) fuzzy inference system of zero order. Considering the reaction curve of the temperature process, the plant model has been identified with the Miller method and a subsequent optimization based on the descending gradient algorithm. Using the conventional plant model, a TSK fuzzy model optimized by the recursive least square’s algorithm is obtained. The TSK fuzzy controller is initialized from the conventional controller and is optimized by descending gradient and a cost function. Applying this controller to a real heat treatment system achieves an approximate minimization of 15 min with respect to the time spent with a conventional controller.

Simulation of such high-resolution, distributed and physically based models demands high performance computing resources. However, the availability of such computing resources is restricted in some domains. In this paper, we propose an approach to reduce computational costs by reducing hydrological model redundancies using similarities in functionality of hydrological model units. The approach applies K-Means clustering to detect similar model units and simulates only one representative unit of each cluster. The clustering is applied when rainfall is forced to the hydrological system and is based on the structure, current state and flux of the model units. Application of this evolutionary approach on a test case results in a 1.8x speedup over the original simulation run time and the RMSE of 0.0049 compared to the original simulation output.","Azmi, Elnaz; Strobl, Marcus; van Pruijssen, Rik; Ehret, Uwe; Meyer, Jörg; Streit, Achim",Computational Science and Its Applications - ICCSA 2020,676,7

In order to assess the risks related to aircraft ground operations, all the influencing variables that can affect the safety of maneuvers should be determined. Generally, catastrophic accidents that occur inside an aerodrome are assigned to the runway incursions and excursions. Incursions are dedicated to all events happening inside the runway (e.g. existence of an obstacle or accident of two aircraft) and excursions are considered for an unsuccessful aircraft operation which leads to surpassing the designated thresholds/borders of the runway. Landing and take-off overruns, as the main excursion events, are responsible for the major recorded incidents/accidents over the past 50 years. Many variables can affect the probability of runway-related accidents such as weather conditions, aircraft braking potential, pilot’s level of experience, etc. The scope of this study is to determine weather-wise parameters that amplify the probability of excursion events. In order to quantify the probability of each type of accidents, the effect of each meteorological variables on the aircraft operation is simulated by RSARA/LRSARA© simulators, released by Aircraft Cooperative Research Program (ACRP). In this regard, specific airports with diverse characteristics (i.e.; landlocked airport, extreme annual operations, extreme runway geometries and weather conditions) are selected as case studies in the analyses. Gusts and wind forces, specifically cross-wind, turned out to be the most dominant weather-wise influencing parameters on the occurrence of runway excursions.","Ketabdari, Misagh; Toraldo, Emanuele; Crispino, Maurizio",Computational Science and Its Applications - ICCSA 2020,676,22

It allows quantification of the hippocampi volume and assessment of their progressive shrinkage, considered as the hallmark symptom of AD. Among several methods published in the literature for hippocampus segmentation, those using anatomical atlases and deformable mesh models are the most promising ones. Although these techniques are convenient ways to embed the shape of the models in the segmentation process, their success greatly depend on the initial positioning of the models. In this work, we propose a new keypoint deformable registration technique that uses a modification of the 3D Scale-Invariant Feature Transform (3D-SIFT) and a keypoint weighting strategy for automatic positioning of hippocampus deformable meshes in brain MR images. Using the Mann-Whitney U test to assess the results statistically, our method showed an average improvement of 11% over the exclusive use of Affine transformation, 30% over the original 3D-SIFT and 7% over the non-weighted point procedure.","Korb, Matheus Müller; Ferrari, Ricardo José",Computational Science and Its Applications - ICCSA 2020,676,1

Standard epidemic risk estimates involve assuming that infections occur according to a branching process and correspond to the probability that the outbreak persists beyond the initial stochastic phase. However, an alternative assessment is to predict whether or not initial cases will lead to a severe epidemic in which available control resources are exceeded. We show how this risk can be estimated by considering three practically relevant potential definitions of a severe epidemic; namely, an outbreak in which: i) a large number of hosts are infected simultaneously; ii) a large total number of infections occur; and iii) the pathogen remains in the population for a long period. We show that the probability of a severe epidemic under these definitions often coincides with the standard branching process estimate for the major epidemic probability. However, these practically relevant risk assessments can also be different from the major epidemic probability, as well as from each other. This holds in different epidemiological systems, highlighting that careful consideration of what constitutes a severe epidemic in an ongoing outbreak is vital for accurate risk quantification.","Thompson, R.N.; Gilligan, C.A.; Cunniffe, N.J.",bioRxiv,676,16

To this end, we designed a short, wordless, animated global health communication video (the CoVideo), which was rapidly distributed through social media channels to an international audience. OBJECTIVE: The objectives of this study were to (1) establish the CoVideo's effectiveness in improving COVID-19 prevention knowledge, and (2) establish the CoVideo's effectiveness in increasing behavioral intent toward COVID-19 prevention. METHODS: In May and June 2020, we enrolled 15,163 online participants from the United States, Mexico, the United Kingdom, Germany, and Spain. We randomized participants to (1) the CoVideo arm, (2) an attention placebo control (APC) arm, and (3) a do-nothing arm, and presented 18 knowledge questions about preventive COVID-19 behaviors, which was our first primary endpoint. To measure behavioral intent, our second primary endpoint, we randomized participants in each arm to five list experiments. RESULTS: Globally, the video intervention was viewed 1.2 million times within the first 10 days of its release and more than 15 million times within the first 4 months. Knowledge in the CoVideo arm was significantly higher (mean 16.95, 95% CI 16.91-16.99) than in the do-nothing (mean 16.86, 95% CI 16.83-16.90; P<.001) arm. We observed high baseline levels of behavioral intent to perform many of the preventive behaviors featured in the video intervention. We were only able to detect a statistically significant impact of the CoVideo on one of the five preventive behaviors. CONCLUSIONS: Despite high baseline levels, the intervention was effective at boosting knowledge of COVID-19 prevention. We were only able to capture a measurable change in behavioral intent toward one of the five COVID-19 preventive behaviors examined in this study. The global reach of this health communication intervention and the high voluntary engagement of trial participants highlight several innovative features that could inform the design and dissemination of public health messages. Short, wordless, animated videos, distributed by health authorities via social media, may be an effective pathway for rapid global health communication during health crises.

Several evidences showed that obesity is a major preventable risk factor and disease modifier of some respiratory conditions such as asthma and Obstructive Sleep Apnea Syndrome (OSAS). Co-occurrence of asthma and obesity may be due to common pathogenetic factors including exposure to air pollutants and tobacco smoking, Western diet, and low Vitamin D levels. Lung growth and dysanapsis phenomenon in asthmatic obese children play a role in impaired respiratory function which appears to be different than in adults. Genes involved in both asthma and obesity have been identified, though a gene-by-environment interaction has not been properly investigated yet. The identification of modifiable environmental factors influencing gene expression through epigenetic mechanisms may change the natural history of both diseases. Another important pediatric respiratory condition associated with obesity is Sleep-Disordered Breathing (SDB), especially Obstructive Sleep Apnea Syndrome (OSAS). OSAS and obesity are linked by a bidirectional causality, where the effects of one affect the other. The factors most involved in the association between OSAS and obesity are oxidative stress, systemic inflammation, and gut microbiota. In OSAS pathogenesis, obesity's role appears to be mainly due to mechanical factors leading to an increase of respiratory work at night-time. However, a causal link between obesity-related inflammatory state and OSAS pathogenesis still needs to be properly confirmed. To prevent obesity and its complications, family education and precocious lifestyle changes are critical. A healthy diet may lead to an improved quality of life in obese children suffering from respiratory diseases. The present review aimed to investigate the links between obesity, asthma and OSAS, focusing on the available evidence and looking for future research fields.","di Palmo, Emanuela; Filice, Emanuele; Cavallo, Alessandra; Caffarelli, Carlo; Maltoni, Giulio; Miniaci, Angela; Ricci, Giampaolo; Pession, Andrea",,676,16

We observe that the online attention to COVID-19 conspiracy theories is significantly and negatively related to human mobility, but its negative impact is noticeably less than those of the attention to official information and personal protection measures. Since human mobility significantly promotes the spread of COVID-19, the attention to official information and personal protection measures lowers COVID-19 cases by 16.16% and 9.41%, respectively, while attention to conspiracy theories only reduces the COVID-19 cases by 6.65%.
