135,Establishing a nationwide emergency department-based syndromic surveillance system for better public health responses in Taiwan,2008-01-18,"BACKGROUND: With international concern over emerging infectious diseases (EID) and bioterrorist attacks, public health is being required to have early outbreak detection systems. A disease surveillance team was organized to establish a hospital emergency department-based syndromic surveillance system (ED-SSS) capable of automatically transmitting patient data electronically from the hospitals responsible for emergency care throughout the country to the Centers for Disease Control in Taiwan (Taiwan-CDC) starting March, 2004. This report describes the challenges and steps involved in developing ED-SSS and the timely information it provides to improve in public health decision-making. METHODS: Between June 2003 and March 2004, after comparing various surveillance systems used around the world and consulting with ED physicians, pediatricians and internal medicine physicians involved in infectious disease control, the Syndromic Surveillance Research Team in Taiwan worked with the Real-time Outbreak and Disease Surveillance (RODS) Laboratory at the University of Pittsburgh to create Taiwan's ED-SSS. The system was evaluated by analyzing daily electronic ED data received in real-time from the 189 hospitals participating in this system between April 1, 2004 and March 31, 2005. RESULTS: Taiwan's ED-SSS identified winter and summer spikes in two syndrome groups: influenza-like illnesses and respiratory syndrome illnesses, while total numbers of ED visits were significantly higher on weekends, national holidays and the days of Chinese lunar new year than weekdays (p < 0.001). It also identified increases in the upper, lower, and total gastrointestinal (GI) syndrome groups starting in November 2004 and two clear spikes in enterovirus-like infections coinciding with the two school semesters. Using ED-SSS for surveillance of influenza-like illnesses and enteroviruses-related infections has improved Taiwan's pandemic flu preparedness and disease control capabilities. CONCLUSION: Taiwan's ED-SSS represents the first nationwide real-time syndromic surveillance system ever established in Asia. The experiences reported herein can encourage other countries to develop their own surveillance systems. The system can be adapted to other cultural and language environments for better global surveillance of infectious diseases and international collaboration.","Wu, Tsung-Shu Joseph; Shih, Fuh-Yuan Frank; Yen, Muh-Yong; Wu, Jiunn-Shyan Julian; Lu, Shiou-Wen; Chang, Kevin Chi-Ming; Hsiung, Chao; Chou, Jr-How; Chu, Yu-Tseng; Chang, Hang; Chiu, Chan-Hsien; Tsui, Fu-Chiang Richard; Wagner, Michael M; Su, Ih-Jen; King, Chwan-Chuen",BMC Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2249581/,193
469,Clinical factors associated with severity in hospitalized children infected with avian influenza (H5N1),2010-06-22,"OBJECTIVE: The World Health organization received reports of 478 laboratory-confirmed cases of influenza A (H5N1) from 15 countries between November 2003 and February 2010. More than 50% of these cases involved patients <20 years of age. Determining an association between the clinical factors at the time of hospital admission and prognosis may be useful for timely and adequate consultation and treatment. It has been difficult to obtain these clinical factors adjusted with other confounding factors, such as age and sex, as published studies of H5N1 virus infection usually reported only a few cases. So, we performed a pooled analysis of the reported cases. METHODS: Five case reports (36 patients <18 years of age) of H5N1 infection from four countries published between 2004 and 2009 were assessed based on available individual clinical data. Using the pooled data for all patients, we investigated the associations between patients’ prognosis and available laboratory findings, such as white blood cell (WBC) counts, platelet (PLT) counts, and serum levels of aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) by adjusting for age and/or sex. RESULTS: The linear regression analysis revealed that mortality was negatively associated with WBC and PLT counts adjusted with age and sex. Increased log AST tended to be associated with a poor prognosis (p = 0.054), but there was no significant association between survival and log ALT level. CONCLUSIONS: Both decreased WBC and PLT counts can be considered to be common predictors of poor prognosis in H5N1 influenza patients <18 years of age. Further studies are needed for clarification.","Furuya, Hiroyuki; Kawachi, Shoji; Shigematsu, Mika; Suzuki, Kazuo; Watanabe, Tetsu",Environ Health Prev Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2999688/,193
2939,Ebola Preparedness in the Netherlands: The Need for Coordination Between the Public Health and the Curative Sector,2017-11-22,"CONTEXT: During the Ebola outbreak in West Africa in 2014-2015, close cooperation between the curative sector and the public health sector in the Netherlands was necessary for timely identification, referral, and investigation of patients with suspected Ebola virus disease (EVD). OBJECTIVE: In this study, we evaluated experiences in preparedness among stakeholders of both curative and public health sectors to formulate recommendations for optimizing preparedness protocols. Timeliness of referred patients with suspected EVD was used as indicator for preparedness. DESIGN: In focus group sessions and semistructured interviews, experiences of curative and public health stakeholders about the regional and national process of preparedness and response were listed. Timeliness recordings of all referred patients with suspected EVD (13) were collected from first date of illness until arrival in the referral academic hospital. RESULTS: Ebola preparedness was considered extensive compared with the risk of an actual patient, however necessary. Regional coordination varied between regions. More standardization of regional preparation and operational guidelines was requested, as well as nationally standardized contingency criteria, and the National Centre for Infectious Disease Control was expected to coordinate the development of these guidelines. For the timeliness of referred patients with suspected EVD, the median delay between first date of illness until triage was 2.0 days (range: 0-10 days), and between triage and arrival in the referral hospital, it was 5.0 hours (range: 2-7.5 hours). In none of these patients Ebola infection was confirmed. CONCLUSIONS: Coordination between the public health sector and the curative sector needs improvement to reduce delay in patient management in emerging infectious diseases. Standardization of preparedness and response practices, through guidelines for institutional preparedness and blueprints for regional and national coordination, is necessary, as preparedness for emerging infectious diseases needs a multidisciplinary approach overarching both the public health sector and the curative sector. In the Netherlands a national platform for preparedness is established, in which both the curative sector and public health sector participate, in order to implement the outcomes of this study.","Swaan, Corien M.; Öry, Alexander V.; Schol, Lianne G.

5025,The spectrum of care for pediatric refugees and asylum seekers at a tertiary health care facility in Switzerland in 2015,2017-09-30,"The L1 family of long interspersed repetitive DNA in the rabbit genome (L1Oc) has been studied by determining the sequence of the five L1 repeats in the rabbit β-like globin gene cluster and by hybridization analysis of other L1 repeats in the genome. L1Oc repeats have a common 3′ end that terminates in a poly A addition signal and an A-rich tract, but individual repeats have different 5′ ends, indicating a polar truncation from the 5′ end during their synthesis or propagation. As a result of the polar truncations, the 5′ end of L1Oc is present in about 11,000 copies per haploid genome, whereas the 3′ end is present in at least 66,000 copies per haploid genome. One type of L1Oc repeat has internal direct repeats of 78 bp in the 3′ untranslated region, whereas other L1Oc repeats have only one copy of this sequence. The longest repeat sequenced, L1Oc5, is 6.5 kb long, and genomic blot-hybridization data using probes from the 5′ end of L1Oc5 indicate that a full length L1Oc repeat is about 7.5 kb long, extending about 1 kb 5′ to the sequenced region. The L1Oc5 sequence has long open reading frames (ORFs) that correspond to ORF-1 and ORF-2 described in the mouse L1 sequence. In contrast to the overlapping reading frames seen for mouse L1, ORF-1 and ORF-2 are in the same reading frame in rabbit and human L1s, resulting in a discistronic structure. The region between the likely stop codon for ORF-1 and the proposed start codon for ORF-2 is not conserved in interspecies comparisons, which is further evidence that this short region does not encode part of a protein. ORF-1 appears to be a hybrid of sequences, of which the 3′ half is unique to and conserved in mammalian L1 repeats. The 5′ half of ORF-1 is not conserved between mammalian L1 repeats, but this segment of L1Oc is related significantly to type II cytoskeletal keratin.","Demers, G.

Hepatitis was induced by injection of mouse hepatitis virus type 2 (MHV‐2) at a strength of either 1 times 10(3) or 1 times 10(4) plaque‐forming units (PFU). Mice without OK‐432 treatment died within 5 days, whereas mice pre‐inoculated with OK‐432 showed survival rates of 50% (1 times 10(3)PFU) or 10% (1 times 10(4)PFU) after 60 days. Survival time was not prolonged if OK‐432 was injected after MHV‐2. Examined histologically, mice not treated with OK‐432 showed severe haemorrhagic necrosis of the liver, often panlobular. Treated mice showed less necrosis; the least necrosis was observed in those injected with OK‐432 before MHV‐2. In those mice injected first with OK‐432 and then with 1 times 10(3)PFU of MHV‐2 that survived 7 days, autopsy showed a very slight and focal hepatic necrosis, with follicular infiltration by lymphocytes and macrophages. Mitogenic reaction of spleen cells was remarkably less than normal in mice with MHV‐2 injection. However, mice injected with OK‐432 before MHV‐2 (same treatment as mice showing high survival rates) showed relatively high reactivity in comparison with mice not treated with OK‐432.","SHIRAI, MUTSUNORI; WATANABE, SEISHIRO; NISHIOKA, MIKIO",J Gastroenterol Hepatol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7166864/,193

10731,Health Care Workers’ Mobile Phones: A Potential Cause of Microbial Cross-Contamination Between Hospitals and Community,2012-07-13,"The nature of discomfort and level of exertion associated with wearing respiratory protection in the health care workplace are not well understood. Although a few studies have assessed these topics in a laboratory setting, little is known about the magnitude of discomfort and the level of exertion experienced by workers while they deliver health care to patients for prolonged periods. The purpose of this study was to determine the magnitude of discomfort and level of exertion experienced by health care workers while wearing respiratory protection for periods up to 8 hr when performing their typical occupational duties. This project was a multiple cross-over field trial of 27 health care workers, aged 24–65, performing their typical, hospital-based occupational duties. Each participant served as his/her own control and wore one of seven respirators or a medical mask for 8 hr (or as long as tolerable) with interposed doffing periods every 2 hr. Self-perceived discomfort and exertion were quantified before each doffing: self-perceived level of discomfort using a visual analog scale, and self-perceived level of exertion using a Borg scale. Overall, and as would be expected, discomfort increased over time with continual respirator use over an 8-hr period. Interestingly, exertion increased only marginally over the same time period. The relatively low level of exertion associated with eight respiratory protective devices, including models commonly used in the U.S. health care workplace, is not likely to substantially influence workers’ tolerability or occupational productivity. However, the magnitude of discomfort does appear to increase significantly over time with prolonged wear. These results suggest that respirator-related discomfort, but not exertion, negatively influences respirator tolerance over prolonged periods. Discomfort may also interfere with the occupational duties of workers.","Shenal, Brian V.; Radonovich, Lewis J.; Cheng, Jing; Hodgson, Michael; Bender, Bradley S.",J Occup Environ Hyg,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7196691/,193
10734,Discomfort and Exertion Associated with Prolonged Wear of Respiratory Protection in a Health Care Setting,2011-12-14,"The protection level offered by filtering facepiece particulate respirators and face masks is defined by the percentage of ambient particles penetrating inside the protection device. There are two penetration pathways: (1) through the faceseal leakage, and the (2) filter medium. This study aimed at differentiating the contributions of these two pathways for particles in the size range of 0.03–1 μm under actual breathing conditions. One N95 filtering facepiece respirator and one surgical mask commonly used in health care environments were tested on 25 subjects (matching the latest National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health fit testing panel) as the subjects performed conventional fit test exercises. The respirator and the mask were also tested with breathing manikins that precisely mimicked the prerecorded breathing patterns of the tested subjects. The penetration data obtained in the human subject- and manikin-based tests were compared for different particle sizes and breathing patterns. Overall, 5250 particle size- and exercise-specific penetration values were determined. For each value, the faceseal leakage-to-filter ratio was calculated to quantify the relative contributions of the two penetration pathways. The number of particles penetrating through the faceseal leakage of the tested respirator/mask far exceeded the number of those penetrating through the filter medium. For the N95 respirator, the excess was (on average) by an order of magnitude and significantly increased with an increase in particle size (p < 0.001): ∼7-fold greater for 0.04 μm, ∼10-fold for 0.1 μm, and ∼20-fold for 1 μm. For the surgical mask, the faceseal leakage-to-filter ratio ranged from 4.8 to 5.8 and was not significantly affected by the particle size for the tested submicrometer fraction. Facial/body movement had a pronounced effect on the relative contribution of the two penetration pathways. Breathing intensity and facial dimensions showed some (although limited) influence. Because most of the penetrated particles entered through the faceseal, the priority in respirator/mask development should be shifted from improving the efficiency of the filter medium to establishing a better fit that would eliminate or minimize faceseal leakage.","Grinshpun, Sergey A.; Haruta, Hiroki; Eninger, Robert M.; Reponen, Tiina; McKay, Roy T.; Lee, Shu-An",J Occup Environ Hyg,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7196699/,193
13119,Towards a conceptual framework of the working alliance in a blended low-intensity cognitive behavioural therapy intervention for depression in primary mental health care: a qualitative study,2020-09-23,The basolateral amygdala (BLA) is critical for associating initially neutral cues with appetitive and aversive stimuli and receives dense neuromodulatory acetylcholine (ACh) projections. We measured BLA ACh signaling and activity of neurons expressing CaMKIIα (a marker for glutamatergic principal cells) in mice during cue-reward learning using a fluorescent ACh sensor and calcium indicators. We found that ACh levels and nucleus basalis of Meynert (NBM) cholinergic terminal activity in the BLA (NBM-BLA) increased sharply in response to reward-related events and shifted as mice learned the cue-reward contingency. BLA CaMKIIα neuron activity followed reward retrieval and moved to the reward-predictive cue after task acquisition. Optical stimulation of cholinergic NBM-BLA terminal fibers led to a quicker acquisition of the cue-reward contingency. These results indicate BLA ACh signaling carries important information about salient events in cue-reward learning and provides a framework for understanding how ACh signaling contributes to shaping BLA responses to emotional stimuli.,"Crouse, Richard B; Kim, Kristen; Batchelor, Hannah M; Girardi, Eric M; Kamaletdinova, Rufina; Chan, Justin; Rajebhosale, Prithviraj; Pittenger, Steven T; Role, Lorna W; Talmage, David A; Jing, Miao; Li, Yulong; Gao, Xiao-Bing; Mineur, Yann S; Picciotto, Marina R",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7529459/,193
15124,Comparison of different cardiovascular risk tools used in HIV patient cohorts in sub-Saharan Africa; do we need to include laboratory tests?,2021-01-28,"Tumor segmentation in brain MRI images is a noted process that can make the tumor easier to diagnose and lead to effective radiotherapy planning. Providing and building intelligent medical systems can be considered as an aid for physicians. In many cases, the presented methods' reliability is at a high level, and such systems are used directly. In recent decades, several methods of segmentation of various images, such as MRI, CT, and PET, have been proposed for brain tumors. Advanced brain tumor segmentation has been a challenging issue in the scientific community. The reason for this is the existence of various tumor dimensions with disproportionate boundaries in medical imaging. This research provides an optimized MRI segmentation method to diagnose tumors. It first offers a preprocessing approach to reduce noise with a new method called Quantum Matched-Filter Technique (QMFT). Then, the deep spiking neural network (DSNN) is implemented for segmentation using the conditional random field structure. However, a new algorithm called the Quantum Artificial Immune System (QAIS) is used in its SoftMax layer due to its slowness and nonsegmentation and the identification of suitable features for selection and extraction. The proposed approach, called QAIS-DSNN, has a high ability to segment and distinguish brain tumors from MRI images. The simulation results using the BraTS2018 dataset show that the accuracy of the proposed approach is 98.21%, average error-squared rate is 0.006, signal-to-noise ratio is 97.79 dB, and lesion structure criteria including the tumor nucleus are 80.15%. The improved tumor is 74.50%, and the entire tumor is 91.92%, which shows a functional advantage over similar previous methods. Also, the execution time of this method is 2.58 seconds.","Ahmadi, Mohsen; Sharifi, Abbas; Hassantabar, Shayan; Enayati, Saman",Biomed Res Int,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7843186/,193

PubMed, Embase and Cochrane Library databases were systematically searched from inception up to September 16th, 2020. A total of 36 studies including 8614 patients were involved in the meta-analysis. Pooled data revealed that high pretreatment NLR was significantly associated with poor outcomes of OS (HR = 1.78, 95% CI = [1.59, 1.99]) and PFS (HR = 1.63, 95% CI = [1.39, 1.91]) in gastric cancer. Subgroup analyses stratified by country, study type, case load, analysis of HR, cutoff of pretreatment NLR, or treatment types arrived at the same conclusion. Pooled data based on different effect models and sensitivity analyses did not change the conclusion. Overall, high pretreatment NLR predicts the poor prognosis of inoperable gastric cancer patients with systemic therapy.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: An electronic cross-sectional knowledge, practice, and attitude survey was carried out. A questionnaire in the form of the hyperlink was sent to pharmacy professionals through e-mail, Facebook messenger, and WhatsApp. Factors linked to pharmacy professionals’ vision in expanding countrywide DIC services were studied with logistic regression in R. RESULTS: A total of 125 pharmacy professionals responded. The participant believing in the published literature as a standard reference for establishing and running the DIC services; participants identifying more challenges in the day-to-day DIC functioning; and participants believing in the ability of DIC in reducing morbidity, mortality, and cost of care had 4.76 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.97–6.44), 4.24 (95% CI = 0.97–6.44), and 2.43 (95% CI = 0.97–6.44) times association with good knowledge score.

The participant who understood DIC services’ real purpose had 2.83 (95% CI = 0.97–6.44) times association with good practice scores. Overall, pharmacy professionals carried better attitude scores, but lesser knowledge, and practice scores than pharmacology professionals.

It was the final aim of the group to co-create culturally sensitive pathways and facilitate co-ownership for further implementation of the pathways in different care systems across Europe. The study design is a mixed method approach. Based on data analysis from a cohort of community-dwelling over-65 citizens in the framework of a longitudinal observational study in Rome, which included health, social and functional capacity data, three personas profiles were developed: the pre-frail, the frail and the very frail personas. Based on these data, experts were asked to co-create care pathways due to evidence and eminence during a workshop and included into a final report. All working groups agreed on a common understanding that integration of care means person-centered integration of health and social care, longitudinally provided across primary and secondary health care including citizens’ individual social, economic and human resources. Elements for consideration during care for pre-frail people are loneliness and social isolation, which, lead to limitation of physical autonomy in the light of reduced access to social support. Frail people need adaption of environmental structures and, again, social resource allocation to maintain at home. Very frail are generally vulnerable patients with complex needs. Most of them remain at home because of a strong individual social support and integrated health care delivery. The approach described in this publication may represent a first approach to scaling-up care delivery in a person-centered approach.","Liotta, G; Roller-Wirnsberger, R; Iaccarino, G; Goossens, E; Tziraki, C; Obbia, P; Pais, S; Cacciatore, F; Zavagli, V; Schena, F; Vinci, A; D’Amico, G; Terraciano, E; Gentili, S; Lindner, S; Illario, M",Transl Med UniSa,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8370530/,193

Although the burden of health expenditure has been examined in some populations, the impact of OOP among slum dwellers in Nigeria when undergoing emergencies, is under-researched. This study sought to examine the prevalence, factors and predictors of catastrophic health expenditure amongst selected slum and non-slum communities undergoing emergency surgery in Southwestern Nigeria. METHODS: The study utilised a descriptive cross-sectional survey design to recruit 450 households through a multistage sampling technique. Data were collected using pre-tested semi-structured questionnaires in 2017. Factors considered for analysis relating to the payer were age, sex, relationship of payer to patient, educational status, marital status, ethnicity, occupation, income and health insurance coverage. Variables factored into analysis for the patient were indication for surgery, grade of hospital, and type of hospital. Households were classified as incurring catastrophic health expenditure (CHE), if their OOP expenditure exceeded 5% of payers’ household budget. Analysis of the data took into account the multistage sampling design. RESULTS: Overall, 65.6% (95% CI: 55.6–74.5) of the total population that were admitted for emergency surgery, experienced catastrophic expenditure. The prevalence of catastrophic expenditure at 5% threshold, among the population scheduled for emergency surgeries, was significantly higher for slum dwellers (74.1%) than for non-slum dwellers (47.7%) (F = 8.59; p = 0.019). Multiple logistic regression models revealed the significant independent factors of catastrophic expenditure at the 5% CHE threshold to include setting of the payer (whether slum or non-slum dweller) (p = 0.019), and health insurance coverage of the payer (p = 0.012). Other variables were nonetheless significant in the bivariate analysis were age of the payer (p = 0.017), income (p<0.001) and marital status of the payer (p = 0.022). CONCLUSION: Although catastrophic health expenditure was higher among the slum dwellers, substantial proportions of respondents incurred catastrophic health expenditure irrespective of whether they were slum or non-slum dwellers. Concerted efforts are required to implement protective measures against catastrophic health expenditure in Nigeria that also cater to slum dwellers.","Obembe, Taiwo A.; Levin, Jonathan; Fonn, Sharon",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8407567/,193
24518,Engineering Control of Airborne Disease Transmission in Health Care Facilities,2009,"Zinc is one of the most abundant trace elements in the human body, and its presence is essential for numerous biological processes including enzymatic activity, immune function, protein synthesis, and wound healing. Given these important roles, zinc has a sophisticated transport system to regulate its homeostasis. Determination of zinc status, however, is difficult to determine as serum levels are closely maintained and are not an accurate reflection of total body zinc or metabolism at the organ level. Fortunately, the discovery of zinc-specific fluorescent dyes has allowed for a much better assessment of zinc status in the respiratory system and has revealed that alcoholism perturbs this highly developed zinc metabolism such that its distribution to the lung and alveolar space is significantly decreased. As a result, this pulmonary zinc deficiency impairs function in the alveolar macrophage, which is the primary host immune cell within the lower airway. Experimental models have demonstrated that correction of this zinc deficiency restores immune function to the alveolar macrophage as best reflected by improved bacterial clearance in response to infection. While the precise mechanisms underlying alcohol-induced zinc deficiency are still under investigation, there is experimental evidence of several important connections with granulocyte–macrophage colony-stimulating factor and oxidative stress, suggesting that alteration of zinc homeostasis may be a fundamental mechanism underlying the cellular pathology seen in the alcohol lung phenotype. This chapter reviews zinc homeostasis and offers insight into our understanding of zinc deficiency in the setting of alcoholism and the potential of zinc as a therapeutic modality in the vulnerable alcoholic host.","Mehta, Ashish J.; Guidot, David M.",Alcohol Use Disorders and the Lung,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7120872/,193

41396,Effect of the COVID-19 Epidemic on Physical Activity in Community-Dwelling Older Adults in Japan: A Cross-Sectional Online Survey,2020-06-23,"Nussbaum’s capability theory by drawing attention to multiple determinants of wellbeing provides a rich and relevant evaluative space for framing antibiotic resistance. I consider the implications of antibiotic resistance for child development and adult capabilities. There are common risk factors for childhood growth stunting and the spread of infectious diseases in both antibiotic sensitive and resistant forms. The interaction between infectious diseases, antibiotic resistance and growth stunting illustrates a clustering of disadvantage. The control of antibiotic resistance requires wide-ranging cooperative action. Cooperation is predicated on an expectation of equitable access to effective antibiotics. This expectation is confounded by inequality both in access to antibiotics, and in the risk that available antibiotics will be ineffective. Securing child development (and adult capabilities) requires that inequalities both in access to antibiotics and in risk factors for the dissemination and transmission of antibiotic resistance are addressed. Inequality undermines the cooperative activity that is control of infectious diseases and compounds the threat to the securing of capabilities that arises from antibiotic resistance.","Millar, Michael",Ethics and Drug Resistance: Collective Responsibility for Global Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7586432/,193
41502,Meaning in Life and Demoralization Constructs in Light of the Interpersonal Theory of Suicide: A Trans-Theoretical Hypothesis for a Cross-Sectional Study,2020-10-29,"While human mobility has important benefits for economic growth, it can generate negative externalities. This paper studies the effect of mobility on the spread of disease in a low-incidence setting when people do not internalize their risks to others. Using malaria as a case study and 15 billion mobile phone records across nine million SIM cards, this paper quantifies the relationship between travel and the spread of disease. The estimates indicate that an infected traveler contributes to 1.66 additional cases reported in the health facility at the traveler's destination. This paper develops a simulation-based policy tool that uses mobile phone data to inform strategic targeting of travelers based on their origins and destinations. The simulations suggest that targeting informed by mobile phone data could reduce the caseload by 50 percent more than current strategies that rely only on previous incidence.","Milusheva, Sveta",J Dev Econ,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7561616/,193
46077,Level of asthma control and mental health of asthma patients during lockdown for COVID-19: a cross-sectional survey,2021-02-24,"Oculomotor behavior can provide insight into the integrity of widespread cortical networks, which may contribute to the differential diagnosis between Alzheimer's disease and frontotemporal dementia. Three groups of patients with Alzheimer's disease, behavioral variant of frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD) and semantic variant of primary progressive aphasia (svPPA) and a sample of cognitively unimpaired elders underwent an eye-tracking evaluation. All participants in the discovery sample, including controls, had a biomarker-supported diagnosis. Oculomotor correlates of neuropsychology and brain metabolism evaluated with 18F-FDG PET were explored. Machine-learning classification algorithms were trained for the differentiation between Alzheimer's disease, bvFTD and controls. A total of 93 subjects (33 Alzheimer's disease, 24 bvFTD, seven svPPA, and 29 controls) were included in the study. Alzheimer's disease was the most impaired group in all tests and displayed specific abnormalities in some visually-guided saccade parameters, as pursuit error and horizontal prosaccade latency, which are theoretically closely linked to posterior brain regions. BvFTD patients showed deficits especially in the most cognitively demanding tasks, the antisaccade and memory saccade tests, which require a fine control from frontal lobe regions. SvPPA patients performed similarly to controls in most parameters except for a lower number of correct memory saccades. Pursuit error was significantly correlated with cognitive measures of constructional praxis and executive function and metabolism in right posterior middle temporal gyrus. The classification algorithms yielded an area under the curve of 97.5% for the differentiation of Alzheimer's disease vs. controls, 96.7% for bvFTD vs. controls, and 92.5% for Alzheimer's disease vs. bvFTD. In conclusion, patients with Alzheimer's disease, bvFTD and svPPA exhibit differentiating oculomotor patterns which reflect the characteristic neuroanatomical distribution of pathology of each disease, and therefore its assessment can be useful in their diagnostic work-up. Machine learning approaches can facilitate the applicability of eye-tracking in clinical practice.","Lage, Carmen; López-García, Sara; Bejanin, Alexandre; Kazimierczak, Martha; Aracil-Bolaños, Ignacio; Calvo-Córdoba, Alberto; Pozueta, Ana; García-Martínez, María; Fernández-Rodríguez, Andrea; Bravo-González, María; Jiménez-Bonilla, Julio; Banzo, Ignacio; Irure-Ventura, Juan; Pegueroles, Jordi; Illán-Gala, Ignacio; Fortea, Juan; Rodríguez-Rodríguez, Eloy; Lleó-Bisa, Alberto; García-Cena, Cecilia E.; Sánchez-Juan, Pascual",Front Aging Neurosci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7891179/,193

The research questions of this are: (1) What are the patterns between facial expressions and negative emotions (i.e., boredom, confusion, and frustration) that learners experienced during online video-based learning? (2) What are the learner’s overall perceptions about their emotions during online video-based learning? This study was conducted with 26 Korean adult learners who took an online video lecture via an asynchronous self-directed mode. Their facial expressions during online learning were recorded and analyzed for detecting affective states. Two judges trained in Ekman’s Facial Action Coding System (FACS) analyzed 210 scenes segmented from the recorded video data using a retrospective affect judgment procedure. The analysis identified 101 incidences of boredom, 82 confusions, and 62 frustrations. Moreover, using Spearman’s rank correlation coefficients and hierarchical clustering, we identified some patterns of significant relationships between facial action units and affective states. The interview data reveal that the potential reasons for negative emotions include lack of concentration, uninteresting content, and one-way content delivery method. Given the massive transition to online video-based learning during and after COVID-19, the results of this study can provide implications concerning how to detect and intervene in potential issues associated with learner’s motivation and affective states.","Lee, Jihyang; So, Hyo-Jeong; Ha, Seunghye; Kim, Eunyoung; Park, Kyudong",Asia-Pacific Edu Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8046582/,193

A total of 589 working adults in Korea responded to the online survey. Of these respondents, 339 were used for exploratory factor analysis and 250 for confirmatory factor analysis. In Stage 1, we translated all items into Korean, back-translated them into English, and then verified the accuracy of the translation. Exploratory factor analysis revealed the 5-factor structure of the Korean version of the Work Need Satisfaction Scale reflecting those of the original scale (survival needs, social contribution needs, autonomy, relatedness, and competence). The scale showed good internal consistency. In Stage 2, confirmatory factor analysis was conducted, and the results indicated that there were no significant differences between a correlational model, a higher-order model, and a higher-order self-determination needs model. Thus, we offered a higher-order self-determination needs model, which had better model fit and was consistent with the original scale and the psychology of working theoretical framework. In addition, convergent and discriminant validity were supported by correlation estimates of the Korean version of the Work Need Satisfaction Scale, and the concurrent validity showed that the Korean version of the Work Need Satisfaction Scale had a significant proportion of explained variance for outcomes. The findings support the conclusion that this study established strong internal consistency and validity for the Korean version of the Work Need Satisfaction Scale. Thus, the scale is unique and meaningful for measuring need satisfaction in work settings in Korea.","Kim, Ji-Hye; Yoo, Kieun; Lee, Seran; Lee, Ki-Hak",Front Psychol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8264301/,193

58844,"Sharing, synthesis and sustainability of data analysis for epidemic preparedness in Europe",2021-10-07,"Dengue virus is the most prevalent mosquito-borne virus, causing approximately 390 million infections and 25,000 deaths per year. Aedes aegypti, the primary mosquito vector of dengue virus, is well-established throughout the state of Florida, United States. Autochthonous transmission of dengue virus to humans in Florida has been increasing since 2009, alongside consistent importation of dengue cases. However, most cases of first infection with dengue are asymptomatic and the virus can be maintained in mosquito populations, complicating surveillance and leading to an underestimation of disease risk. Metagenomic sequencing of A. aegypti mosquitoes in Manatee County, Florida revealed the presence of dengue virus serotype 4 (DENV-4) genomes in mosquitoes from multiple trapping sites over 2years, in the absence of a human DENV-4 index case, and even though a locally acquired case of DENV-4 has never been reported in Florida. This finding suggested that: (i) DENV-4 may circulate among humans undetected; (ii) the virus was being maintained in the mosquito population, or (iii) the detected complete genome sequence may not represent a viable virus. This study demonstrates that an infectious clone generated from the Manatee County DENV-4 (DENV-4M) sequence is capable of infecting mammalian and insect tissue culture systems, as well as adult female A. aegypti mosquitoes when fed in a blood meal. However, the virus is subject to a dose dependent infection barrier in mosquitoes, and has a kinetic delay compared to a phylogenetically related wild-type (WT) control virus from a symptomatic child, DENV-4H (strain Homo sapiens/Haiti-0075/2015, GenBank accession MK514144.1). DENV-4M disseminates from the midgut to the ovary and saliva at 14days post-infection. Viral RNA was also detectable in the adult female offspring of DENV-4M infected mosquitoes. These results demonstrate that the virus is capable of infecting vector mosquitoes, is transmissible by bite, and is vertically transmitted, indicating a mechanism for maintenance in the environment without human-mosquito transmission. These findings suggest undetected human-mosquito transmission and/or long-term maintenance of the virus in the mosquito population is occurring in Florida, and underscore the importance of proactive surveillance for viruses in mosquitoes.","Ayers, Jasmine B.; Xie, Xuping; Coatsworth, Heather; Stephenson, Caroline J.; Waits, Christy M.; Shi, Pei-Yong; Dinglasan, Rhoel R.",Front Microbiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8500192/,193

59574,Kaleidoscope.,2015,"ABSTRACT Carrageenan, an extract from red algae, was identified over a decade ago as a potent inhibitor of human papillomavirus (HPV) infection in vitro. Following this discovery, several studies evaluated carrageenan's anti-HPV activity in cells, experimental animals, and humans. We reviewed the evidence for carrageenan's anti-HPV activity. Studies had to be in vitro, in vivo, or in humans and report on carrageenan's anti-HPV activity. Of the 39 records identified in PubMed and 29 records in Clinicaltrials.gov, 22 records were included after screening: eight in vitro (including two ex vivo), three in vivo, five in vitro and in vivo, three clinical studies, and three trial protocols. A total of 12 studies evaluated carrageenan exclusively, while seven considered carrageenan combined with additional anti-viral or other agents. One study protocol will evaluate carrageenan exclusively and two others will evaluate carrageenan-combination products. Most clinical studies evaluated carrageenan's ability to prevent HPV acquisition (n=4), while one study explored its ability to promote clearance of existing infection (defined as absence of HPV DNA detection). Carrageenan's anti-HPV activity was observed consistently across study designs, except in two studies: one in vitro study where two of the HPV types tested were not significantly inhibited by carrageenan and one phase IIB trial in gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men. This review supports the premise that carrageenan, alone or in combination with other anti-viral agents, might be a potential prevention strategy complementary to HPV vaccination for women.","Laurie, Cassandra; El-Zein, Mariam; Coutlée, François; de Pokomandy, Alexandra; Franco, Eduardo L",Sexually transmitted diseases,https://doi.org/10.1097/olq.0000000000001363; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33433173/,193

A total of 250 frozen archived pediatric respiratory specimens previously characterized as either negative or positive for one or more viruses by real-time PCR were examined using the eSensor RVP. Overall agreement between the eSensor RVP and corresponding real-time PCR assays for shared analytes was 99.2% (kappa = 0.96 [95% confidence interval {CI}, 0.94 to 0.98]). The combined positive percent agreement was 95.4% (95% CI, 92.5 to 97.3); the negative percent agreement was 99.7% (95% CI, 99.4 to 99.8). The mean real-time PCR threshold cycle (C(T)) value for specimens with discordant results was 39.73 (95% CI, 38.03 to 41.43). Detection of coinfections and correct identification of influenza A virus subtypes were comparable between methods. Of note, the eSensor RVP rhinovirus assay was found to be more sensitive and specific than the corresponding rhinovirus real-time PCR. In contrast, the eSensor RVP adenovirus B, C, and E assays demonstrated some cross-reactivity when tested against known adenovirus serotypes representing groups A through F. The eSensor RVP is robust and relatively easy to perform, it involves a unique biosensor technology for target detection, and its multiplexed design allows for efficient and simultaneous interrogation of a single specimen for multiple viruses. Potential drawbacks include a slower turnaround time and the need to manipulate amplified product during the protocol, increasing the possibility of contamination.","Pierce, Virginia M; Hodinka, Richard L",Journal of clinical microbiology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jcm.01384-12; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22875893/,193

OBJECTIVE To identify studies that involved the obstetric provider in interventions for either the perinatal management of obesity and/or gestational weight gain in a systematic review. SEARCH STRATEGY A keyword search of databases was performed up to April 2017. SELECTION CRITERIA Obstetric providers who participated in an intervention with the aim to change a provider's clinical practice, knowledge, and/or satisfaction with the intervention in relation to the perinatal management of obesity or gestational weight gain were included. Provider intervention could include training or education, changes in systems or organization of care, or resources to support practice. PROSPERO database #42016038921. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS Bias was assessed according to the validated Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool. The following variables were synthesized: study location and setting, provider and patient characteristics, intervention features, outcomes and efficacy, and strengths and weakness. MAIN RESULTS Of the 6,821 abstracts screened, seven studies (4 quantitative, 3 mixed-methods) with a total of 335 providers met the inclusion criteria; two of which focused on the management of obesity, three focused on gestational weight gain, and two focused on both topics. Interventions that incorporated motivational interviewing skills (n = 2), required additional training for the research study and addressed specific knowledge deficits such as nutrition and exercise (n = 3), and interfaced with the electronic medical record (n = 1) demonstrated the greatest impact on provider outcomes. Provider reported satisfaction scores were generally favorable, but none addressed provider-level efficacy in practice change. CONCLUSIONS Given the limited number of studies, varying range of provider participation, and lack of provider-level efficacy, further evaluation of provider training and involvement in interventions for perinatal obesity or gestational weight gain is indicated to determine best practices for provider and patient outcomes.","Kominiarek, Michelle A; O'Dwyer, Linda C; Simon, Melissa A; Plunkett, Beth A",PloS one,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0205268; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30289912/,193

66682,Kaleidoscope.,2020-03-01,"BACKGROUND Diaphragm dysfunction is defined by a value of twitch tracheal pressure in response to magnetic phrenic stimulation (twitch pressure) amounting to less than 11 cmH2O. This study assessed whether this threshold or a lower one would predict accurately weaning failure from mechanical ventilation. Twitch pressure was compared to ultrasound measurement of diaphragm function. METHODS In patients undergoing a first spontaneous breathing trial, diaphragm function was evaluated by twitch pressure and by diaphragm ultrasound (thickening fraction). Receiver operating characteristics curves were computed to determine the best thresholds predicting failure of spontaneous breathing trial. RESULTS Seventy-six patients were evaluated, 48 (63%) succeeded and 28 (37%) failed the spontaneous breathing trial. The optimal thresholds of twitch pressure and thickening fraction to predict failure of the spontaneous breathing trial were, respectively, 7.2 cmH2O and 25.8%, respectively. The receiver operating characteristics curves were 0.80 (95% CI 0.70-0.89) for twitch pressure and 0.82 (95% CI 0.73-0.93) for thickening fraction. Both receiver operating characteristics curves were similar (p = 0.83). A twitch pressure value lower than 11 cmH2O (the traditional cutoff for diaphragm dysfunction) predicted failure of the spontaneous breathing trial with a sensitivity of 89% (95% CI 72-98%) and a specificity of 45% (95% CI 30-60%). CONCLUSIONS Failure of spontaneous breathing trial can be predicted with a lower value of twitch pressure than the value defining diaphragm dysfunction. Twitch pressure and thickening fraction had similar strong performance in the prediction of failure of the spontaneous breathing trial.","Dres, Martin; Goligher, Ewan C; Dubé, Bruno-Pierre; Morawiec, Elise; Dangers, Laurence; Reuter, Danielle; Mayaux, Julien; Similowski, Thomas; Demoule, Alexandre",Annals of intensive care,https://doi.org/10.1186/s13613-018-0401-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29687276/,193

Interferon (IFN) β-1a may prevent the underlying event of vascular leakage. Objective To determine the efficacy and adverse events of IFN-β-1a in patients with moderate to severe ARDS. Design, Setting, and Participants Multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group trial conducted at 74 intensive care units in 8 European countries (December 2015-December 2017) that included 301 adults with moderate to severe ARDS according to the Berlin definition. The radiological and partial pressure of oxygen, arterial (Pao2)/fraction of inspired oxygen (Fio2) criteria for ARDS had to be met within a 24-hour period, and the administration of the first dose of the study drug had to occur within 48 hours of the diagnosis of ARDS. The last patient visit was on March 6, 2018. Interventions Patients were randomized to receive an intravenous injection of 10 μg of IFN-β-1a (144 patients) or placebo (152 patients) once daily for 6 days. Main Outcomes and Measures The primary outcome was a score combining death and number of ventilator-free days at day 28 (score ranged from -1 for death to 27 if the patient was off ventilator on the first day). There were 16 secondary outcomes, including 28-day mortality, which were tested hierarchically to control type I error. Results Among 301 patients who were randomized (mean age, 58 years; 103 women [34.2%]), 296 (98.3%) completed the trial and were included in the primary analysis. At 28 days, the median composite score of death and number of ventilator-free days at day 28 was 10 days (interquartile range, -1 to 20) in the IFN-β-1a group and 8.5 days (interquartile range, 0 to 20) in the placebo group (P = .82). There was no significant difference in 28-day mortality between the IFN-β-1a vs placebo groups (26.4% vs 23.0%; difference, 3.4% [95% CI, -8.1% to 14.8%]; P = .53). Seventy-four patients (25.0%) experienced adverse events considered to be related to treatment during the study (41 patients [28.5%] in the IFN-β-1a group and 33 [21.7%] in the placebo group). Conclusions and Relevance Among adults with moderate or severe ARDS, intravenous IFN-β-1a administered for 6 days, compared with placebo, resulted in no significant difference in a composite score that included death and number of ventilator-free days over 28 days.

DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Multicenter, retrospective cohort including 502 adults hospitalized with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 between March 1, 2020 and May 8, 2020 within one of 15 participating hospitals in 5 health systems across 5 states in the Southeast US. METHODS The study objectives were to identify risk factors that could increase progression to hospital mortality and severe disease (defined as a composite of intensive care unit admission or requirement of mechanical ventilation) in hospitalized SARS-CoV-2 patients in the Southeast US. RESULTS A total of 502 patients were included, and the majority (476/502, 95%) had clinically evaluable outcomes. Hospital mortality was 16% (76/476), while 35% (177/502) required ICU admission, and 18% (91/502) required mechanical ventilation. By both univariate and adjusted multivariate analysis, hospital mortality was independently associated with age (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 2.03 for each decade increase, 95% CI 1.56-2.69), male sex (aOR 2.44, 95% CI: 1.34-4.59), and cardiovascular disease (aOR 2.16, 95% CI: 1.15-4.09).

73406,Telehealth: Improving Access to and Quality of Pediatric Health Care.,2021-08-30,"BACKGROUND Primary healthcare centres (PHCs) form the foundation of the Indian public health system, and thus their effective functioning is paramount in ensuring the population's health. The World Health Organisation (WHO) has set six aspects of performance assessment for general health systems, which are hardly applicable to the PHC setup in a low- and middle-income country. The Primary Health Care Performance Initiative (PHCPI) has prescribed a framework with five domains consisting of 36 indicators for primary healthcare performance assessment from a policy point of view. For the assessment to be realistic, it should include inputs from stakeholders involved in care delivery, so this study examines the perspectives of healthcare providers at PHCs in India. METHODOLOGY The authors used qualitative research methodology in the form of responsive evaluations of healthcare provider's interviews to understand the indicators of PHC performance. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION The study results showed that healthcare providers considered efficient teamwork, opportunities for enhancing provider skills and knowledge, job satisfaction, effective PHC administration, and good community relationship as PHC performance assessment. These domains of performance could be considered the 'missing link' in PHC assessment, since they are deemed important by providers and did not coincide with the WHO aspects and the PHCPI performance assessment framework.","Bangalore Sathyananda, Rajeshwari; Krumeich, Anja; Manjunath, Usha; de Rijk, Angelique; van Schayck, C P",The International journal of health planning and management,https://doi.org/10.1002/hpm.3176; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33955048/,193

74925,"Knowledge, attitudes and practices of patients with chronic illnesses during the COVID-19 pandemic: A cross-sectional survey from Pakistan.",2021-06-09,"Tiger frog virus (TFV) belongs to the genus Ranavirus (family Iridoviridae) and causes significant harm in cultured frogs, resulting in substantial losses in ecological and economic field in Southern China. Attachment is the first step in viral life cycle, which is dependent on the interactions of virions with extracellular matrix (ECM) components. Studying this process will help in understanding virus infection and controlling viral diseases. In this study, the roles of primary ECM components in TFV attachment were investigated. The results on the kinetics of virus attachment showed successful TFV attachment to the cell surface as a relatively rapid process after the TFV was used to inoculate cells for 10 min at 4 °C. Western blot and quantitative PCR analysis results showed that soluble fibronectin, collagen IV, laminin, or hyaluronic acid treatment with TFV caused no significant effect on virus attachment. Soluble heparin, heparan sulfate and chondroitin sulfate A/B could inhibit TFV attachment in a dose-dependent manner. Enzymic digestion by cell surface heparin/heparan sulfate using heparinase I, II, and III could significantly prevent TFV attachment, suggesting that heparan sulfate plays an important role in TFV attachment. Furthermore, the binding assays of heparin-agarose beads and virion showed that TFV virions specifically bound with heparin in a dose-dependent manner. Given that heparin is a structural analogue of heparan sulfate, the above results suggest that heparan sulfate might serve as an attachment factor of TFV infection. Our work would be beneficial to understand the mechanisms of TFV attachment and the interactions of TFV with cellular receptors.","Liu, Chang; Qin, Xiao-Wei; He, Jian; Weng, Shao-Ping; He, Jian-Guo; Guo, Chang-Jun",Fish & shellfish immunology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.fsi.2020.09.008; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32976972/,193

METHODS A total of 113 patients scheduled for an elective sigmoidectomy were randomized to receive either a conventional open (54 patients) or a laparoscopic (59 patients) approach. Postoperatively, an opaque wound dressing was applied and left in place for 4 days, and patients from both groups were managed similarly. The primary endpoints for analysis were (1) postoperative pain; (2) duration of postoperative ileus; and (3) duration of hospital stay (ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT 00453830). RESULTS The median duration of procedure was 165 minutes (range, 90-285) in the laparoscopy group and 110 minutes (range, 70-210) in the open group (P < 0.0001). The median delay between surgery and first bowel movement was 76 (range, 31-163) hours in the laparoscopy group versus 105 (range, 53-175) hours in the open group (P < 0.0001). The median score for maximal pain (assessed by a visual analog scale) was 4 (range, 1-10) in the laparoscopy group and 5 (range, 1-10) in the open group (P = 0.05). Finally, the median duration of hospital stay was 5 days (range, 4-69) in the laparoscopy group versus 7 days (range, 5-17) in the open group (P < 0.0001). CONCLUSION Laparoscopic sigmoid resection is associated with a 30% reduction in duration of postoperative ileus and hospital stay; by comparison, benefits in terms of postoperative pain appear less impressive, when the patient is blinded to the surgical technique.","Gervaz, Pascal; Inan, Ihsan; Perneger, Thomas; Schiffer, Eduardo; Morel, Philippe",Annals of surgery,https://doi.org/10.1097/sla.0b013e3181dbb5a5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20505508/,193

In this manuscript, we investigated the primary symptoms and basic hematological presentations of SARS-CoV-2 infection among the Bangladeshi patients. METHODOLOGY This was a multicentre cross-sectional study done on COVID-19 patients tested positive by RT PCR in Bangladesh. Clinical features of mild to moderate degree of COVID-19 patients; hematological and biochemical admission day laboratory findings of moderate to severe degree hospitalized COVID-19 patients were analyzed. RESULTS COVID-19 patients in Bangladesh commonly presented with fever, cough, fatigue, shortness of breath, and sore throat. But symptoms like myalgia, diarrhea, skin rash, headache, Abdominal pain/cramp, nausea, vomiting, restlessness, and a higher temperature of >100°F have a greater presentation rate and more frequent than other published studies. CRP and Prothrombin time was found to increase in all the patients. Serum ferritin, ESR, SGPT, and D-Dimer were increased among 53.85%, 80.43, 44%, and 25% patients. 17.39% of the patients had leucocytosis and neutrophilia, 28.26% presented with lymphocytopenia, and 62.52% had mild erythrocytopenia. The difference between the decrease hemoglobin count (higher in the male) and increased SGPT (higher in female) against gender was significant. CONCLUSIONS Our study had evaluated a different expression in presenting symptoms of COVID-19 patients in Bangladesh. CRP, Prothrombin time, serum ferritin, ESR, SGPT, D-Dimer, erythrocytopenia, and lymphocytopenia can be assessments for diagnosis and prognosis of COVID-19 disease. Decrease hemoglobin count (higher in the male) and increased SGPT (higher in female) establish these two markers as a good candidate for diagnostic value against gender.","Mohiuddin Chowdhury, Abu Taiub Mohammed; Karim, Md Rezaul; Mehedi, Hm Hamidullah; Shahbaz, Mohammad; Chowdhury, Md Wazed; Dan, Guo; He, Shuixiang",Journal of infection in developing countries,https://doi.org/10.3855/jidc.13692; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33690203/,193

RESULTS 17 studies met the criteria for inclusion. The majority were conducted in Cuba and Trinidad & Tobago and 35% were conducted over 10 years ago. Samples were small, and largely consisted of older adult females and patients with type 2 diabetes. Four of 8 (50%) studies that reported on HbA1c, 5 of 12 (42%) that reported on blood pressure and 2 of 7 (29%) that reported on body mass index observed significant improvements. Study heterogeneity precluded our ability to conduct a meta-analysis. The overall quality of evidence based on GRADE criteria was low for all outcomes assessed.

78900,Authors' reply.,2021-03-01,"In hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS), the mechanisms leading to left heart hypoplasia and their associated fetal abnormalities are largely unknown. Current animal models have limited utility in resolving these questions as they either do not fully reproduce the cardiac phenotype, do not survive to term, and/or have very low disease penetrance. Here, we report the development of a surgically-induced mouse model of HLHS that overcomes these limitations. Briefly, we microinjected the fetal left atrium of embryonic day (E) 14.5 mice with an embolizing agent under high-frequency ultrasound guidance, which partially blocks blood flow into the left heart and induces hypoplasia. At term (E18.5), all positively embolized mice exhibit retrograde aortic arch flow, non-apex forming left ventricles and hypoplastic ascending aortas. We thus report the development of the first mouse model of isolated HLHS with a fully penetrant cardiac phenotype and survival to term. Our method allows for the interrogation of previously intractable questions, such as determining the mechanisms of cardiac hypoplasia and fetal abnormalities observed in HLHS, as well as testing of mechanism-based therapies which are urgently lacking.","Rahman, Anum; DeYoung, Taylor; Cahill, Lindsay S; Yee, Yohan; Debebe, Sarah K; Botelho, Owen; Seed, Mike; Chaturvedi, Rajiv R; Sled, John G",Disease models & mechanisms,https://doi.org/10.1242/dmm.049077; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34514502/,193
79801,Rapid assessment of mental health of Detroit-area health care workers during the COVID-19 pandemic.,2021-05-01,"DNA and protein arrays are commonly accepted as powerful exploratory tools in research. This has mainly been achieved by the establishment of proper guidelines for quality control, allowing cross-comparison between different array platforms. As a natural extension, glycan microarrays were subsequently developed, and recent advances using such arrays have greatly enhanced our understanding of protein-glycan recognition in nature. However, although it is assumed that biologically significant protein-glycan binding is robustly detected by glycan microarrays, there are wide variations in the methods used to produce, present, couple, and detect glycans, and systematic cross-comparisons are lacking. We address these issues by comparing two arrays that together represent the marked diversity of sialic acid modifications, linkages, and underlying glycans in nature, including some identical motifs. We compare and contrast binding interactions with various known and novel plant, vertebrate, and viral sialic acid-recognizing proteins and present a technical advance for assessing specificity using mild periodate oxidation of the sialic acid chain. These data demonstrate both the diversity of sialic acids and the analytical power of glycan arrays, showing that different presentations in different formats provide useful and complementary interpretations of glycan-binding protein specificity. They also highlight important challenges and questions for the future of glycan array technology and suggest that glycan arrays with similar glycan structures cannot be simply assumed to give similar results.","Padler-Karavani, Vered; Song, Xuezheng; Yu, Hai; Hurtado-Ziola, Nancy; Huang, Shengshu; Muthana, Saddam; Chokhawala, Harshal A; Cheng, Jiansong; Verhagen, Andrea; Langereis, Martijn A; Kleene, Ralf; Schachner, Melitta; de Groot, Raoul J; Lasanajak, Yi; Matsuda, Haruo; Schwab, Richard; Chen, Xi; Smith, David F; Cummings, Richard D; Varki, Ajit",The Journal of biological chemistry,https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.m112.359323; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22549775/,193

One hundred and fifty-nine neotropic felids and 51 exotic felids from 28 captive settings in Brazil were tested. While antibodies against Feline parvovirus and Feline coronavirus (FCoV), Feline calicivirus and Bartonella spp. were frequently detected by serologic tests, antibodies against Felid herpesvirus 1 or infection with hemotropic mycoplasmas were less prevalent. Serologic evidence of exposure to Ehrlichia spp., Feline immunodeficiency virus, and Feline leukemia virus (FeLV) was detected rarely, and infections with FeLV, Ehrlichia spp., and Cytauxzoon spp. were found infrequently. The detected Bartonella sequence was molecularly similar to B. koehlerae and B. henselae; for Cytauxzoon, the sequence resembled those from domestic cats. No Anaplasma phagocytophilum and Theileria spp. infections were detected. The positive test results varied significantly among different facilities and species.

This study investigated the true benefits of the laparoscopic approach in infants with high anorectal malformation. PATIENTS AND METHODS A retrospective analysis was performed in 28 infants with high anorectal malformation treated between 1990 and 2007. Fifteen were treated by open ARP, and 13 were treated by laparoscopic ARP. Surgical durations, amount of bleeding, complications, anorectal pressure measurements, barium enema study, and clinical assessment were compared between the 2 groups. RESULTS The amount of intraoperative bleeding was significantly less in laparoscopic ARP (12 ± 11 g) than in open ARP (65 ± 44 g) (P = .003). Anal resting pressure was 34 ± 9 cm H(2)O after laparoscopic ARP and 31 ± 14 cm H(2)O after open ARP. Anorectal reflex was positive in 1 (7%) of 15 after open ARP and 3 (23%) of 13 after laparoscopic ARP. There was no significant difference in barium enema study and clinical assessment between the 2 groups. With regard to postoperative complications, mucosal prolapse occurred in 10 (67%) of 15 after open ARP and in none of 13 after laparoscopic ARP (P = .003). CONCLUSION Benefits of the laparoscopic approach were reduced intraoperative bleeding and a lower incidence of postoperative anal mucosal prolapse. These results indicate that minimal dissection of the mesorectum in laparoscopic ARP may provide those better outcomes.","Kimura, Osamu; Iwai, Naomi; Sasaki, Yasunari; Tsuda, Tomoki; Deguchi, Eiichi; Ono, Shigeru; Furukawa, Taizo",Journal of pediatric surgery,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpedsurg.2010.08.042; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21129552/,193
81878,The Design and Implementation of a Heart Disease Reversal Program in the Veterans Health Administration: Before and During the COVID-19 Pandemic.,2020-12-01,"INTRODUCTION Job burnout is an occupational psychological syndrome with a high prevalence among nurses in China. Hemodialysis (HD) nursing work has the characteristics of high intensity, high technical content, and high risk. The aims of this study were to investigate the prevalence and level of job burnout among HD nurses in China and explore the potential factors associated with burnout among HD nurses. METHODS This was a cross-sectional study in 2019. Survey data were collected from 2738 HD centers in mainland China. Job burnout was measured by the Chinese version of the Maslach Burnout Inventory. The working atmosphere, interpersonal relationships with colleagues, and intention to leave were each assessed by a single question respectively. Multiple linear regression and structural equation modeling were used for the analysis. FINDINGS A total of 10,570 surveys were collected. A total of 1199 (11.34%) HD nurses reported a high level of emotional exhaustion, 782 (7.40%) reported a high level of depersonalization, and 6767 (64.02%) reported a low level of personal accomplishment. Job burnout in the Northeastern region of mainland China was higher than that in other regions (p < 0.05). The working atmosphere, interpersonal relationships, region, hospital level, educational level, career planning, age, and number of children were significantly associated with burnout among HD nurses (p < 0.001, adjusted R2 = 0.313). The working environment, individual factors, and specialist nurse training were significantly associated with HD nurse burnout and intention to leave (comparative fit index = 0.907; goodness of fit index = 0.930; root mean square error of approximation = 0.055). DISCUSSION There were notable regional differences in the burnout of HD nurses. This study contributes to the knowledge of the possible relationship of job burnout and intention to leave in HD nurses. It is suggested that improving the working atmosphere or interpersonal relationships and providing more training opportunities can alleviate job burnout in HD nurses.","Guo, Weiai; Zhou, Lifang; Song, Li; Zhang, Guanrong; Zhong, Mi; Sun, Chunyan; Zheng, Shuqian; Chen, Yinggui; Liang, Xinling; Shi, Wei; Fu, Xia",Hemodialysis international.

Estimates of community-based CT/NG prevalence are lacking among gay, bisexual and other men who have sex with men (GBM). METHODS Respondent driven sampling was used to recruit GBM in Montréal, Canada between February 2017 and June 2018. Specimens provided from urogenital, rectal and pharyngeal sites were analyzed using nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT) to detect CT/NG. Prevalence estimates of CT/NG, overall and by anatomical site were calculated. All estimates are RDS-adjusted. RESULTS Among 1177 GBM, the prevalence of rectal, urogenital, pharyngeal and overall were respectively 2.4%, 0.4%, 0.4% and 2.8% for CT infections, and 3.1%, 0.4%, 3.5% and 5.6% for NG infections. If testing had been limited to the urogenital site, 80% and 94% of CT and NG infections, respectively, would have been missed. CONCLUSIONS This community-based study among GBM shows that the CT prevalence was about half of that observed for NG. A large part of CT/NG infections involves only the extragenital sites, highlighting the need for systematic multisite screening regardless of symptoms. In the mist of the COVID-19 pandemic and the limited CT/NG screening capacity due to test kits shortage, it might be considered to prioritize rectal and pharyngeal CT/NG testing over urogenital testing in asymptomatic GBM.","Harvey-Lavoie, Simonne; Apelian, Herak; Labbé, Annie-Claude; Cox, Joseph; Messier-Peet, Marc; Moodie, Erica; Fourmigue, Alain; Moore, David; Lachowsky, Nathan J; Grace, Daniel; Hart, Trevor A; Jollimore, Jody; Fortin, Claude; Lambert, Gilles",Sexually transmitted diseases,https://doi.org/10.1097/olq.0000000000001486; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34030155/,193

However, the sensitivity of CCE in detecting advanced colorectal cancer (CRC) has not been sufficiently evaluated. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to assess the sensitivity of CCE in detecting advanced CRC. METHODS Patients previously diagnosed with advanced CRC by conventional colonoscopy underwent CCE. Primary outcome measure was the sensitivity of CCE in detecting advanced CRC per patient and per lesion. Secondary parameters measured were the sensitivity of CCE in detecting polyps ≥6 mm and ≥10 mm in size in a per-lesion analysis and the safety of CCE. RESULTS Of the 21 advanced CRC lesions in 20 patients, 17 were detected by CCE. The per-patient and per-lesion sensitivities of CCE for detecting advanced CRC lesions were 85% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 62-97%) and 81% (95% CI: 58-95%), respectively. All advanced CRC lesions were diagnosed in the accessible region by CCE while the capsule was still functional. A significant association was found between incomplete CCE and failure to diagnose advanced CRC. No severe adverse events occurred. CONCLUSION The diagnostic capability of CCE in detecting advanced CRC was limited in cases of procedure incompletion. Refining procedures to increase CCE procedure completion rates are required to enhance CRC detection.","Ota, Yumiko; Yamada, Atsuo; Kobayashi, Yuka; Niikura, Ryota; Shimpoh, Takayuki; Narita, Akiko; Yoshida, Shuntaro; Suzuki, Nobumi; Watabe, Hirotsugu; Hirata, Yoshihiro; Ishihara, Soichiro; Sunami, Eiji; Watanabe, Toshiaki; Koike, Kazuhiko",Digestive endoscopy : official journal of the Japan Gastroenterological Endoscopy Society,https://doi.org/10.1111/den.12862; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28295697/,193
86321,Kaleidoscope.,2017,"BACKGROUND Obesity in young adults and adolescents is associated with chronic co-morbidities. This project investigated whether being overweight or obese is a risk factor for periodontitis in adolescents (13-17 years) and young adults (18-34 years). METHODS A search of 12 databases was conducted using Medical Subject Headings/Index and Emtree terms. Based on the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses, articles published between 2003 and 2016 were screened that reported periodontal and anthropometric measures. The Newcastle-Ottawa Scale was used to appraise the quality of studies. RESULTS Of 25 eligible studies from 12 countries, 17 showed an association between obesity and periodontitis (odds ratios ranged from 1.1 to 4.5). The obesity indicators of body mass index, waist circumference, waist-hip ratio and body fat percentage were significantly associated with measures of periodontitis of bleeding on probing, plaque index, probing depths, clinical attachment loss, calculus, oral hygiene index and community periodontal index.

While one universally accepted selection criterion is academic capacity, there are other criteria such as communication skills and local criteria (e.g., socio-cultural values) that are no less important. This article reviews the policies and methods of selection to medical schools in seven countries with varying socio-economic conditions and healthcare systems. Senior academics involved in medical education in Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Sri Lanka, and Taiwan completed a pre-agreed pro-forma per each country to describe the country's admission policies and methods. The details were then compared and contrasted. This review identifies tension between many of the policies and methods used in medical school admissions, such as between the need to assess non-cognitive abilities and widen access, and between the need for more medical professionals and the requirement to set high entry standards. Finding the right balance requires careful consideration of all variables, including the country's human resource needs; socio-economic status; graduates' expected competencies; and the school's vision, mission, and availability of resources.","Soemantri, Diantha; Karunathilake, Indika; Yang, Jen-Hung; Chang, Shan-Chwen; Lin, Chyi-Her; Nadarajah, Vishna D; Nishigori, Hiroshi; Samarasekera, Dujeepa D; Lee, Shuh Shing; Tanchoco, Lilybeth R; Ponnamperuma, Gominda",Korean journal of medical education,https://doi.org/10.3946/kjme.2020.169; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32723988/,193

METHODS Subjects escorting dental patients attending two dental hospitals in North Jordan were included. Each subject received full periodontal examination, including probing pocket depth (PPD), clinical attachment level (CAL), gingival index (GI) and plaque index (PI). The numbers of M, D and F teeth were also recorded. The Zung Self-rating Depression Scale was used to determine susceptibility to depression. RESULTS The frequency of high susceptibility to depression among periodontitis-free subjects and those with periodontitis was found to be 48% and 50% respectively. There was no statistically significant association between susceptibility to depression symptoms and periodontal parameters, including PPD, CAL, PI and GI (P > 0.05). HOWEVER, SUBJECTS WITH LOW SUSCEPTIBILITY TO DEPRESSION HAD SIGNIFICANTLY MORE FT THAN SUBJECTS HIGHLY SUSCEPTIBLE TO DEPRESSION.

Before applying radiographic measurement to the treatment decision and before correlating the measurements to clinical outcome, an accuracy of measurements must be established. PURPOSE To summarize existing evidence on accuracy of the radiographic measurements of: (i) dorsal/volar tilt of the distal radius; (ii) radial shortening; (iii) ulnar variance; (iv) radial inclination; and (v) articular step-off of the distal radius. We conducted a systematic critical review of the literature. MATERIAL AND METHODS MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library database were searched. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews (PRISMA) guidelines were followed. Quality of included studies was assessed using a tailored version of the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (QUADAS-2) tool. RESULTS A total of 5908 publications were screened and five studies met the inclusion criteria. Four studies assessed accuracy of articular step-off but with contradictory outcomes. Radiographic measurements of step-off were accurate in two studies and inaccurate in one study. In the last step-off study, some of their measurements varied significantly but accuracy was not reported. The radiographic measurements of ulnar variance were significantly underestimated when compared to the true variance. We were not able to include studies that assessed accuracy of radial shortening, radial inclination, or dorsal/volar tilt against a reference standard. CONCLUSION Currently, evidence is not available to support accuracy of the radiographic measurements commonly used to characterize distal radius fractures.","Jensen, Janni; Rasmussen, Benjamin Sb; Duus, Louise A; Torfing, Trine; Precht, Helle; Tromborg, Hans; Graumann, Ole",Acta radiologica,https://doi.org/10.1177/0284185119834687; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30845815/,193
92501,Reduced No-Show Rates and Sustained Patient Satisfaction of Telehealth During the COVID-19 Pandemic.,2021-03-04,"UNLABELLED Affibody molecules are small (7 kDa) proteins with subnanomolar targeting affinity. Previous SPECT studies in xenografts have shown that the Affibody molecule (111)In-DOTA-Z(HER2)(:2395) can discriminate between high and low human epidermal growth factor receptor type 2 (HER2)-expressing tumors, indicating that radiolabeled Affibody molecules have potential for patient selection for HER2-targeted therapy. Compared with SPECT, PET with positron-emitting radionuclides, such as (18)F, may improve imaging of HER2 expression because of higher sensitivity and improved quantification of PET. The aim of the present study was to determine whether the (18)F-labeled NOTA-conjugated Affibody molecule Z(HER2)(:2395) is a suitable agent for imaging of HER2 expression. The tumor-targeting properties of (18)F-labeled Z(HER2)(:2395) were compared with (111)In- and (68)Ga-labeled Z(HER2)(:2395) in mice with HER2-expressing SK-OV-3 xenografts. METHODS Z(HER2)(:2395) was conjugated with NOTA and radiolabeled with (18)F, (68)Ga, and (111)In. Radiolabeling with (18)F was based on the complexation of Al(18)F by NOTA. The 50% inhibitory concentration values for NOTA-Z(HER2)(:2395) labeled with (19)F, (69)Ga, and (115)In were determined in a competitive cell-binding assay using SK-OV-3 cells. Mice bearing subcutaneous SK-OV-3 xenografts were injected intravenously with radiolabeled NOTA-Z(HER2)(:2395). One and 4 h after injection, PET/CT or SPECT/CT images were acquired, and the biodistribution was determined by ex vivo measurement. RESULTS The 50% inhibitory concentration values for (19)F-, (69)Ga-, and (115)In-NOTA-Z(HER2)(:2395) were 5.0, 6.3, and 5.3 nM, respectively. One hour after injection, tumor uptake was 4.4 ± 0.8 percentage injected dose per gram (%ID/g), 5.6 ± 1.6 %ID/g, and 7.1 ± 1.4 %ID/g for (18)F-, (68)Ga-, and (111)In-NOTA-Z(HER2)(:2395), respectively, and the respective tumor-to-blood ratios were 7.4 ± 1.8, 8.0 ± 1.3, and 4.8 ± 1.3. Tumor uptake was specific, because uptake could be blocked efficiently by coinjection of an excess of unlabeled Z(HER2)(:2395). PET/CT and SPECT/CT images clearly visualized HER2-expressing SK-OV-3 xenografts. CONCLUSION This study showed that (18)F-NOTA-Z(HER2)(:2395) is a promising new imaging agent for HER2 expression in tumors. Affibody molecules were successfully labeled with (18)F within 30 min, based on the complexation of Al(18)F by NOTA. Further research is needed to determine whether this technique can be used for patient selection for HER2-targeted therapy.","Heskamp, Sandra; Laverman, Peter; Rosik, Daniel; Boschetti, Frederic; van der Graaf, Winette T A; Oyen, Wim J G; van Laarhoven, Hanneke W M; Tolmachev, Vladimir; Boerman, Otto C","Journal of nuclear medicine : official publication, Society of Nuclear Medicine",https://doi.org/10.2967/jnumed.111.093047; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22173842/,193

We sought to decipher factors predictive of a deterioration in phenotype ('transition') in patients initially presenting with non-severe disease. METHODS Patients from the 'Attikon' cohort with disease duration ≥1 year were included. Disease at diagnosis was categorised as mild, moderate or severe, based on the British Isles Lupus Assessment Group manifestations and physician judgement. 'Transition' in severity was defined as an increase in category of severity at any time from diagnosis to last follow-up. Multivariable logistic regression was performed to identify baseline factors associated with this transition. RESULTS 462 patients were followed for a median (IQR) of 36 (120) months. At diagnosis, more than half (56.5%) had a mild phenotype. During disease course, transition to more severe forms was seen in 44.2%, resulting in comparable distribution among severity patterns at last follow-up (mild 28.4%, moderate 33.1%, severe 38.5%). Neuropsychiatric involvement at onset (OR 6.33, 95% CI 1.22 to 32.67), male sex (OR 4.53, 95% CI 1.23 to 16.60) and longer disease duration (OR 1.09 per 1 year, 95% CI 1.04 to 1.14) were independently associated with transition from mild or moderate to severe disease. Patients with disease duration ≥3 years who progressed to more severe disease had more than 20-fold increased risk to accrue irreversible damage. CONCLUSION Almost half of patients with initially non-severe disease progress to more severe forms of SLE, especially men and patients with positive anti-double-stranded DNA or neuropsychiatric involvement at onset. These data may have implications for the management of milder forms of lupus.","Nikolopoulos, Dionysis S; Kostopoulou, Myrto; Pieta, Antigoni; Flouda, Sofia; Chavatza, Katerina; Banos, Aggelos; Boletis, John; Katsimbri, Pelagia; Boumpas, Dimitrios T; Fanouriakis, Antonis",Lupus science & medicine,https://doi.org/10.1136/lupus-2020-000394; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32601172/,193

METHODS Eighty-five patients who underwent treatment for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) or chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) with BR at the University of Arizona Cancer Center from November 2013 to June 2019 were evaluated through retrospective chart review. Patients were stratified into two groups: those who were given G-CSF for primary prophylaxis (n = 47) and for secondary prophylaxis (n = 38). G-CSF-included filgrastim or pegfilgrastim. The primary endpoints were incidence of febrile neutropenia and grade 3 or 4 neutropenia. RESULTS Same-day G-CSF compared with next-day G-CSF was the most common G-CSF dosing method utilized in primary and secondary prophylaxis (94% and 100%), respectively. Primary and secondary prophylaxis groups were similar on baseline characteristics (p > 0.05); the primary outcome of FN (p > 0.05); all secondary outcomes (p > 0.05) except for a higher frequency of dose delays in secondary (40%) vs primary prophylaxis patients (13%; p = 0.01), and mean absolute neutrophil counts (ANC) in cycles 1 through 5. With higher ANC levels observed during all cycles in the primary prophylaxis group compared with secondary prophylaxis. CONCLUSIONS In this single-center retrospective study, BR-treated lymphoma and CLL patients receiving primary versus secondary with G-CSF showed similar outcomes except, notably, for chemotherapy dose delays that may put secondary patients at risk for poor treatment outcomes. Further research is needed to evaluate the impact of primary versus secondary prophylaxis on treatment outcomes.","Moore, Logan; Bartels, Trace; Persky, Daniel O; Abraham, Ivo; Kumar, Abhijeet; McBride, Ali",Supportive care in cancer : official journal of the Multinational Association of Supportive Care in Cancer,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00520-020-05982-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33547525/,193

As of June 2020, 107 (55%) of the 194 WHO Member States have introduced HPV vaccination. The Americas and Europe are by far the WHO regions with the most introductions, 85% and 77% of their countries having already introduced respectively. A record number of introductions was observed in 2019, most of which in low- and middle- income countries (LMIC) where access has been limited. Programs had an average performance coverage of around 67% for the first dose and 53% for the final dose of HPV. LMICs performed on average better than high- income countries for the first dose, but worse for the last dose due to higher dropout. Only 5 (6%) countries achieved coverages with the final dose of more than 90%, 22 countries (21%) achieved coverages of 75% or higher while 35 (40%) had a final dose coverage of 50% or less. When expressed as world population coverage (i.e., weighted by population size), global coverage of the final HPV dose for 2019 is estimated at 15%. There is a long way to go to meet the 2030 elimination target of 90%. In the post-COVID era attention should be paid to maintain the pace of introductions, specially ensuring the most populous countries introduce, and further improving program performance globally.","Bruni, Laia; Saura, Anna; Montoliu, Alexandra; Brotons, Maria; Alemany, Laia; Diallo, Mamadou Saliou; Afsar, Oya Zeren; LaMontagne, D Scott; Mosina, Liudmila; Contreras, Marcela; Velandia-González, Martha; Pastore, Roberta; Gacic-Dobo, Marta; Bloem, Paul",Preventive medicine,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ypmed.2020.106399; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33388322/,193

We sought to (1) estimate the prevalence of face mask use in northern Vermont and (2) assess the effect of age and sex on the likelihood of face mask use. METHODS We monitored the entrances to public businesses and visually assessed age, sex, and face mask use. We collected 1004 observations during May 16-30, 2020. We calculated estimates of overall face mask use and odds ratios (ORs) for effects by age and sex. RESULTS Of 1004 observations, 758 (75.5%) sampled people used a face mask. Our census-weighted estimate was 74.1%. A higher percentage of females than males wore face masks (83.8% vs 67.6%). The odds of face mask use were lower among males than among females (OR = 0.52; 95% CI, 0.37-0.73). Face mask use generally decreased with decreasing age: 91.4% among adults aged >60, 70.7% among adults aged 26-60, 74.8% among people aged 15-25, and 53.3% among people aged ≤14.

By summarizing the research progress and guidelines in recent years in the fields of colorectal cancer disease screening, treatment strategies (including early colorectal cancer, locally advanced colorectal cancer, obstructive colorectal cancer, metastatic colorectal cancer and the treatment of patients after neoadjuvant therapy), the choice of medication and time limit for adjuvant therapy, the protective measures for patients undergoing emergency surgery, the re-examination of postoperative patients and the protection of medical staff, etc., authors improve treatment strategies in order to provide more choices for patients to obtain the best treatment under the severe epidemic situation of new coronavirus pneumonia. Meanwhile we hope that it can also provide more timely treatment modeling schemes for colleagues.","Hu, X H; Niu, W B; Zhang, J F; Li, B K; Yu, B; Zhang, Z Y; Zhou, C X; Zhang, X N; Gao, Y; Wang, G Y",Zhonghua wei chang wai ke za zhi = Chinese journal of gastrointestinal surgery,https://doi.org/10.3760/cma.j.cn.441530-20200217-00058; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32192294/,193

Here we reveal that translation occurs through successive translocation--and-pause cycles. The distribution of pause lengths, with a median of 2.8 s, indicates that at least two rate-determining processes control each pause. Each translocation step measures three bases--one codon-and occurs in less than 0.1 s. Analysis of the times required for translocation reveals, surprisingly, that there are three substeps in each step. Pause lengths, and thus the overall rate of translation, depend on the secondary structure of the mRNA; the applied force destabilizes secondary structure and decreases pause durations, but does not affect translocation times. Translocation and RNA unwinding are strictly coupled ribosomal functions.","Wen, Jin-Der; Lancaster, Laura; Hodges, Courtney; Zeri, Ana-Carolina; Yoshimura, Shige H; Noller, Harry F; Bustamante, Carlos; Tinoco, Ignacio",Nature,https://doi.org/10.1038/nature06716; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18327250/,193

118651,One Psychiatrist's Perspective on Physician-Assisted Death.,2021-03-01,"AIM The objective was to test how nurse burnout impairs day-to-day adaptive self-regulation strategies that link levels of regulatory resources with employee job performance. BACKGROUND Regulatory resources help employees manage their thoughts, feelings, and behaviours on a daily basis. On days when these resources are low, employees may engage in maladaptive self-regulation: more self-undermining (i.e. creating additional obstacles) and less job crafting (i.e. optimizing job demands and resources), which debilitates their work performance. We expected that self-regulation is impaired especially when individuals exhibit low motivation and low ability to regulate their behaviour, that is, when they experience elevated burnout. DESIGN This research used a daily diary design. Nurses responded to a general survey and then completed daily diary surveys in three different moments: before, during and after work for 10 consecutive workdays (total reports N = 732). METHOD A sample of 81 nurses from Polish hospitals and primary healthcare centres completed self-reported questionnaires between January and March 2018. Hypotheses were tested using multilevel modelling in Mplus. RESULTS Momentary self-regulatory capacity before work was negatively related to self-undermining and positively related to job crafting, and it indirectly predicted daily job performance. As hypothesized, these indirect relationships were moderated by general, chronic burnout. We found that only for employees with low levels of burnout, daily self-regulation was linked with better functioning via increased job crafting and decreased self-undermining. CONCLUSION Chronic burnout disturbs day-to-day behaviour regulation. Individuals with elevated burnout symptoms have difficulty to translate momentary boosts in regulatory resources into adaptive strategies that are linked with higher performance. IMPACT Our findings call for better recovery programmes, strategic Human Resource Management practices aimed at reducing factors that deplete daily self-regulatory resources, and finally top-down interventions preventing burnout among employees in the healthcare system.","Roczniewska, Marta; Bakker, Arnold B",Journal of advanced nursing,https://doi.org/10.1111/jan.14872; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33955050/,193

METHODS Prospectively collected data for patients treated between January 2006 and June 2009 were analyzed retrospectively. After careful patient and therapy selection, 213 AIS patients with a mean NIHSS score of 14.2 at presentation underwent intervention. End points analyzed were Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) 2/3 reperfusion, symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (SICH) rates, and 90-day outcomes (modified Rankin Scale [mRS] and mortality). Multivariate binary logistic regression analysis was used to assess independent predictors of end points. RESULTS Of 189 patients with anterior circulation occlusions, 135 were treated within 0-8 hours, 33 were treated after 8 or more hours, and 21 were treated after wake-up stroke (WUS). Among 24 patients treated with posterior circulation occlusions, 4 had WUS. After treatment, 72.3% patients had TIMI 2/3 reperfusion; SICH rate was 8.7%; at 90 days, 36.6% recovered to mRS 2 or less. SICH rate was higher in patients with anterior circulation strokes who received treatment 8 or more hours after symptom onset (odds ratio [OR] = 3.8) and patients with WUS (OR = 4.9). In patients treated within 8 hours of onset of symptoms of anterior circulation stroke, SICH rate was only 6.7%. There was no difference in outcomes in patients with WUS compared with patients treated less than 8 hours after stroke onset. CONCLUSIONS This is the first and largest prospective study to the authors' knowledge that shows endovascular therapy for AIS patients in a real-world setting. High recanalization rates with low SICH rates were achieved using careful patient and therapy selection.","Natarajan, Sabareesh K; Karmon, Yuval; Snyder, Kenneth V; Ohta, Hajime; Hauck, Erik F; Hopkins, L Nelson; Siddiqui, Adnan H; Levy, Elad I",World neurosurgery,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.wneu.2010.06.035; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21492595/,193

During their renal excretion, CAs are concentrated in the renal tubuli which might enhance the viscosity difference between monomeric and dimeric CAs. The viscosity of a CA might have an underestimated importance for renal safety, as suggested by recent publications. In this study, we investigated the viscosities of CAs at the concentrations expected to be present in renal tubules. This concentration process was simulated in vitro using dialysis. Furthermore, we investigated urine viscosity and urine flow in rodents after administration of several non-ionic monomeric and dimeric CAs. MATERIALS AND METHODS To estimate the viscosity of the CAs in vivo, we performed an in vitro dialysis of monomeric and dimeric CAs at various physiological osmolalities of the renal tubulus (290, 400, 500, 700 and 1000 mOsm/kg H2O). Following the dialysis, the iodine concentrations and the viscosities of the CAs were determined. Furthermore, to investigate the concentration process in vivo, we measured the urine viscosity and the urine flow in Han Wister rats after the administration of Iopromide, Iohexol, Ioversol, Iomeprol, Iodixanol, and Iosimenol at comparable iodine concentrations. As a control, saline was injected at the same volume. RESULTS In vitro dialysis of the dimeric CA increased the iodine concentration and strongly increased the viscosity at all tested osmolalities. In contrast, for the monomeric agents an increase in concentration and viscosity was observed only at 700 as well 1000 mOsm/kg H2O but to a lesser extent. In summary, dialysis strongly enhanced the viscosity differences between the non-ionic monomeric and dimeric CAs. The administration of dimeric CAs leads to a strong increase in urine viscosity; this was not observed for the monomeric CAs. In contrast, a significantly higher urine flow was measured after the administration of the monomeric CAs as compared to the dimeric CAs. CONCLUSION We demonstrated that the viscosity differences between monomeric and dimeric CAs are strongly enhanced due to a concentration process of the CAs upon increasing osmolalities, a process which is likely to take place in a similar manner in the tubular system. This result suggests that the viscosity of the dimeric agents increases dramatically in vivo and gives a plausible explanation for measured enhancement of urine viscosity upon dimeric CA administration. On the other hand, the higher osmolality of the monomeric agents causes an osmodiuresis, indicated by a higher urine flow, which leads to a faster elimination of the CAs from the kidney.","Jost, Gregor; Lengsfeld, Philipp; Lenhard, Diana C; Pietsch, Hubertus; Hütter, Joachim; Sieber, Martin A",European journal of radiology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejrad.2011.02.003; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21376497/,193

However, diagnosis of borderline PM hypertrophy with TTE is not always feasible due to cumbersome interpretation of different PM diameters and the absence of precise normal ranges in the literature. The objective of this study was to obtain TTE normal cutoff values and to describe convenient indexes of PM dimensions. METHODS Healthy volunteers with normal electrocardiogram were included for TTE assessment. Vertical (Vd) and horizontal (Hd) PM diameters were measured to obtain maximum diameter (Md) and areas of the anterolateral PM (APM) and posteromedial PM (PPM) to obtain PM total area (PMTA). RESULTS A total of 82 patients were screened, and 6 (7.3%) with bifid PM were excluded from analysis. APM and PPM had similar Vd (APM: 8.3 ± 1.2, PPM: 7.9 ± 1.1 mm2 , P = NS) and Hd (APM: 8.2 ± 1.3, PPM: 8.3 ± 1.2 mm2 , P = NS). Finally, Md (9 ± 1.2 mm; P95 = 11 mm) and PMTA (106.5 ± 24.2 mm2 ; P95 = 150.8 mm2 ) were obtained. Correlation between PMTA and Md was positive (P < .001), and out-of-range values for Md and PMTA were similar (2.6% vs 5.3%); there was excellent agreement between both indexes (K = 0.82). CONCLUSIONS Maximum diameter and PMTA are convenient indexes to describe PM dimensions. However, given the high equivalence between both indexes, we propose the use of Md due to its simplicity and ease of calculation. Our findings suggest that patients with any PM diameter ≥12 mm should be considered abnormal.","Diaz Babio, Gonzalo; Vera Janavel, Gustavo L; Carrero, Celeste; Masson Juarez, Gerardo; Mezzadra, María; Constantin, Ivan; Garcia Botta, Teresa; Stutzbach, Pablo",Echocardiography,https://doi.org/10.1111/echo.14785; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32608129/,193

Recently it was demonstrated that peri-operative disruptions in central pain processing may be able to predict persistent postsurgical pain at long term follow-up in breast cancer patients. The aim of the current report is to present a short protocol to obtain pain thresholds to different stimuli at multiple sites and a measure of endogenous analgesia in breast cancer patients. We have used this method successfully in a clinical context and detail some representative results from a clinical study.","van Helmond, Noud; Timmerman, Hans; Olesen, Søren S; Drewes, Asbjørn M; Kleinhans, Joris; Wilder-Smith, Oliver H; Vissers, Kris C; Steegers, Monique A",Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE,https://doi.org/10.3791/56918; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29443087/,193
131505,Association of Respiratory Picornaviruses With High Acuity and Severe Illness in a Pediatric Health Care System.,2015,"With more than 1,700 laboratory-confirmed infections, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) remains a significant threat for public health. However, the lack of detailed data on modes of transmission from the animal reservoir and between humans means that the drivers of MERS-CoV epidemics remain poorly characterized. Here, we develop a statistical framework to provide a comprehensive analysis of the transmission patterns underlying the 681 MERS-CoV cases detected in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) between January 2013 and July 2014. We assess how infections from the animal reservoir, the different levels of mixing, and heterogeneities in transmission have contributed to the buildup of MERS-CoV epidemics in KSA. We estimate that 12% [95% credible interval (CI): 9%, 15%] of cases were infected from the reservoir, the rest via human-to-human transmission in clusters (60%; CI: 57%, 63%), within (23%; CI: 20%, 27%), or between (5%; CI: 2%, 8%) regions. The reproduction number at the start of a cluster was 0.45 (CI: 0.33, 0.58) on average, but with large SD (0.53; CI: 0.35, 0.78). It was >1 in 12% (CI: 6%, 18%) of clusters but fell by approximately one-half (47% CI: 34%, 63%) its original value after 10 cases on average. The ongoing exposure of humans to MERS-CoV from the reservoir is of major concern, given the continued risk of substantial outbreaks in health care systems. The approach we present allows the study of infectious disease transmission when data linking cases to each other remain limited and uncertain.","Cauchemez, Simon; Nouvellet, Pierre; Cori, Anne; Jombart, Thibaut; Garske, Tini; Clapham, Hannah; Moore, Sean; Mills, Harriet Linden; Salje, Henrik; Collins, Caitlin; Rodriquez-Barraquer, Isabel; Riley, Steven; Truelove, Shaun; Algarni, Homoud; Alhakeem, Rafat; AlHarbi, Khalid; Turkistani, Abdulhafiz; Aguas, Ricardo J; Cummings, Derek A T; Van Kerkhove, Maria D; Donnelly, Christl A; Lessler, Justin; Fraser, Christophe; Al-Barrak, Ali; Ferguson, Neil M",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1519235113; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27457935/,193

METHODS One hundred twelve patients underwent laparoscopic TEP for bilateral inguinal hernia and 767 patients underwent laparoscopic TEP for a unilateral hernia from March 2004 to January 2010. RESULTS The mean age of the patients was older in bilateral group than that in the unilateral group, and the proportion of female patients was lower in the bilateral group. The distribution of the types of hernia was different in both the groups (P<0.001). The mean operation time and the mean patient cost for TEP in the bilateral group were 1.5 times longer and more expensive than that in the unilateral group. However, there were no differences in the mean number of hospital days and postoperative complications. There was 1 recurrence in the bilateral group, but it had no statistical significance (P=0.127). CONCLUSIONS Laparoscopic TEP repair is safe and feasible for treating bilateral inguinal hernia. Bilateral repair also has some advantages such as no additional admission, a decreased operation time, and cost-effectiveness.","Choi, Yoon Young; Hur, Kyung Yul","Surgical laparoscopy, endoscopy & percutaneous techniques",https://doi.org/10.1097/sle.0b013e31822177fd; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21857476/,193

METHODS We assessed COVID-19-related health worries and grief, and current mental health symptoms (depression, generalized anxiety, and PTSD) in 1,123 U.S. women during the COVID-19 pandemic (May 21 to August 17, 2020) through a cross-sectional study design. RESULTS Among our respondents, 36.4% reported clinically significant levels of depression, 22.7% for generalized anxiety, and 10.3% for PTSD. Women with pre-existing mental health diagnoses based on their self-reported history were 1.6-to-3.7 more likely to score at clinically significant levels of depression, generalized anxiety, and PTSD. Approximately 18% reported high levels of COVID-19-related health worries and were 2.6-to-4.2 times more likely to score above the clinical threshold for mental health symptoms. Approximately 9% reported high levels of grief and were 4.8-to-5.5 times more likely to score above the clinical threshold for mental health symptoms. CONCLUSIONS Perinatal women with pre-existing mental health diagnoses show elevated symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic. Although causation cannot be inferred, COVID-19-related health worries and grief experiences may increase the likelihood of mental health symptoms among those without pre-existing mental health concerns. Providers should develop strategies for addressing health-related worry and grief within their practice.","Liu, Cindy H; Erdei, Carmina; Mittal, Leena",Psychiatry research,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2020.113552; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33229122/,193

133073,Valuing diversity in value assessment: introducing the PhRMA Foundation Health Disparities Challenge Award.,2021-09-01,"BACKGROUND Social participation is an important aspect of health and well-being across the lifespan, but older adults might encounter some barriers, which has been highlighted in the current Covid-19 pandemic situation, where technology has become the primary way to maintain contact with family and friends. In fact, technology can serve both as a facilitator and barrier to social participation in later life, and this issue needs to be further understood. AIM To identify the barriers and facilitators encountered by older adults in using technology to promote social participation. METHODS A systematic review was conducted. Studies were included if they were peer-reviewed, written in English or French, included participants 50 years or older, included technology to promote social participation, and reported potential barriers or facilitators regarding such technologies. Four databases were included: MEDLINE, CINAHL, PsychINFO and, ERIC. Each study was reviewed by two independent reviewers. The quality of the study was appraised using the Crowe Critical Appraisal Tool. RESULTS Seventeen studies were included in this report. Four main themes emerged from the data: perceived benefits of the technology, self-confidence and knowledge about using the technology efficiently and safely, affordability of the technology, and ability of the technology to adapt to the physical and cognitive declines in later life. CONCLUSION These findings can help health care professionals to make better decisions when deciding to recommend technology for their older clients. IMPLICATIONS FOR REHABILITATION Acceptance of technology to promote social participation in later life is a multi-complex process. There is no ""one size fits all"" approach, a person-centered intervention must be used. When introducing new technologies, using an adapted/tailored training approach could potentially increase self-efficacy in using technology. Rehabilitation professionals' misconceptions concerning the use of technology in later life can be a barrier to acceptance. It's important to be aware of our own believes and attitudes in this context.","Benoit-Dubé, Laurence; Jean, Eudia Kévine; Aguilar, Melissa Arriola; Zuniga, Ana-Marcia; Bier, Nathalie; Couture, Mélanie; Lussier, Maxime; Lajoie, Xanthy; Belchior, Patrícia",Disability and rehabilitation.

The role of the report of sadness or nervousness during the pandemic was also evaluated as a mediator of this association. Data from a behavior survey during COVID-19, conducted in Brazil with 45,161 people (18 years old or older), from April 24 to May 24, 2020, were used. The outcome variable was the onset or increase in sleep problems, and the exposure variable was the presence of CNCDs. The adjusted Odds Ratio of the association between CNCDs and sleep was estimated, and a mediation analysis was performed to test the effect of the report of sadness or nervousness on this association, using the Karlson Holm Breen method. The increase in sleep problems was reported by 44.9% of the population, and 33.9% reported at least one CNCD. The chance of sleep problems was higher among people with diabetes (1.34; 1.05-1.71), hypertension (1.26; 1.06-1.50), and with coronary heart diseases (1.36; 1.13-1.65) or respiratory diseases (1.42; 1.04-1.93). Compared to people without CNCDs, individuals with at least one CNCD had a 36% greater chance of impaired sleep (1.36; 1.19-1.55). The report of sadness or nervousness explained 45.1% of the association between CNCD and sleep. Our findings alert us to care for the emotional state and sleep of chronic patients during the waves of the COVID-19 pandemic, and indicate the need for sleep monitoring in this population.","Lima, Margareth Guimaraes; Malta, Deborah Carvalho; Werneck, André de Oliveira; Szwarcwald, Célia Landmann; Souza, Donatila Barbieri de Oliveira; Gomes, Crizian Saar; Damacena, Giseli Nogueira; da Silva de Almeida, Wanessa; Barros, Marilisa Berti de Azevedo",Sleep medicine,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.sleep.2021.02.052; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33736945/,193

At the time of writing, no preventive vaccine has been developed and tested in the community. This study was conducted to review studies aimed at preventing the spread of the coronavirus worldwide. METHODS This study was a review of the evidence-based literature and was conducted by searching databases, including Google Scholar, PubMed, and ScienceDirect, until April 2020. The search was performed based on keywords including ""coronavirus"", ""COVID-19"", and ""prevention"". The list of references in the final studies has also been re-reviewed to find articles that might not have been obtained through the search. The guidelines published by trustworthy organizations such as the World Health Organization and Center for Disease Control have been used in this study. CONCLUSION So far, no vaccine or definitive treatment for COVID-19 has been invented, and the disease has become a pandemic. Therefore, observation of hand hygiene, disinfection of high-touch surfaces, observation of social distance, and lack of presence in public places are recommended as preventive measures. Moreover, to control the situation and to reduce the incidence of the virus, some of the measures taken by the decision-making bodies and the guidelines of the deterrent institutions to strengthen telecommuting of employees and reduce the presence of people in the community and prevent unnecessary activities, are very important.","Arefi, Maryam Feiz; Poursadeqiyan, Mohsen",Work,https://doi.org/10.3233/wor-203218; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32925133/,193

Our study aimed to investigate the clinical features of patients on maintenance hemodialysis. DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, & MEASUREMENTS In this retrospective, single-center study, we included 49 hospitalized patients on maintenance hemodialysis and 52 hospitalized patients without kidney failure (controls) with confirmed coronavirus disease 2019 at Tongren Hospital of Wuhan University from January 30, 2020 to March 10, 2020. Demographic, clinical, laboratory, and radiologic characteristics and treatment and outcomes data were analyzed. The final date of follow-up was March 19, 2020. RESULTS The median age of 101 patients was 62 years (interquartile range, 49-72). All patients were local residents of Wuhan. In terms of common symptoms, there were differences between patients on hemodialysis and controls (fatigue [59% versus 83%], dry cough [49% versus 71%], and fever [47% versus 90%]). Lymphocyte counts were decreased (0.8×109/L [patients on hemodialysis] versus 0.9×109/L [controls], P=0.02). Comparing patients on hemodialysis with controls, creatine kinase-muscle and brain type, myoglobin, hypersensitive troponin I, B-type natriuretic peptide, and procalcitonin were increased, and the percentage of abnormalities in bilateral lung was higher in computed tomographic scan (82% versus 69%, P=0.15) and unilateral lung was lower (10% versus 27%, P=0.03). Common complications including shock, acute respiratory distress syndrome, arrhythmia, and acute cardiac injury in patients on hemodialysis were significantly higher. Compared with controls, more patients on hemodialysis received noninvasive ventilation (25% versus 6%, P=0.008). As of March 19, 2020, three patients on hemodialysis (6%) were transferred to the intensive care unit and received invasive ventilation. Seven patients on hemodialysis (14%) had died. CONCLUSIONS The main symptoms of coronavirus disease 2019 pneumonia, including fever and cough, were less common in patients on hemodialysis. Patients on hemodialysis with coronavirus disease 2019 were at higher risk of death.","Wu, Jun; Li, Jushuang; Zhu, Geli; Zhang, Yanxia; Bi, Zhimin; Yu, Yean; Huang, Bo; Fu, Shouzhi; Tan, Yiqing; Sun, Jianbin; Li, Xiangyou",Clinical journal of the American Society of Nephrology : CJASN,https://doi.org/10.2215/cjn.04160320; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32444393/,193

MMP-1 is involved in inflammation and tissue remodelling. There have been studies focused on anti-inflammatory effect of maternal omega use on human milk while little is known about the effect of omega use on breastmilk proteases. Leptin is an important hormone that influences MMP levels in various tissues and exerts its metabolic effects. In our study we assessed the levels of MMP-1, TIMP-1, leptin, IL-6 and FA's including PUFA in breastmilk from women who used omega-3. MATERIALS AND METHODS Our study was a cross-sectional study included 67(Group 1, n = 32, omega user; Group 2 n = 35, non-user)lactating women and their infan MMP-1, TIMP-1, leptin, IL-6 and FA's were evaluated in breastmilk of both groups. MMP-1, TIMP-1, IL-6 and leptin were measured by enzyme-linked immunoabsorbent assay (ELISA) method. Breastmilk fatty acids were measured by gas chromatography flame ionisation detector (GC-FID). RESULTS Matrix metalloproteinase-1 (MMP-1) levels in breastmilk were significantly lower in breastmilk from omega users (mean ± SD, 0.455 ± 0.1) than non-users (mean ± SD, 0.677 ± 0.289) (p=.0001). MMP-1 and omega 6:3 ratio were positively correlated (r: 0.301, p=.01). MMP levels were correlated with IL-6 (Pearson's r: 0.411, p<.001). MMP-1 and leptin levels were positively correlated (r: .388, p=.001). CONCLUSION MMP-1 levels in breastmilk, may be modified by maternal omega use in pregnancy which may help to redirect extracellular matrix remodelling and metabolic programming in early infancy.","Sahin, Ozlem Naciye; Ozpinar, Aysel; Serdar, Muhittin","The journal of maternal-fetal & neonatal medicine : the official journal of the European Association of Perinatal Medicine, the Federation of Asia and Oceania Perinatal Societies, the International Society of Perinatal Obstetricians",https://doi.org/10.1080/14767058.2020.1814241; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32962453/,193

MATERIALS AND METHODS FokI genotyping and bacterial quantification were performed using real-time polymerase chain reaction. Periodontitis severity was determined using mean clinical attachment level (CAL). Regression analyses examined the associations between the FokI polymorphism (rs2228570) and bacterial proportions or periodontitis severity. Effect modification by smoking or drinking was assessed. RESULTS The study population comprised 1,460 individuals, aged 39-66 years. After multivariable adjustment, the FokI risk genotypes (CC+CT) were associated with elevated Porphyromonas gingivalis proportions (regression coefficient (β) =0.294±0.139; p=0.034) and increased mean CAL (β=0.130±0.048; p=0.007). The effect of the FokI polymorphism on P. gingivalis proportions was greater in smokers (β=0.897±0.328; p=0.006) compared to non-smokers (β=0.164±0.153; p=0.282) and in drinkers (β=0.668±0.242; p=0.006) compared to non-drinkers (β=0.114±0.169; p=0.500). The genotype*smoking interaction for P. gingivalis proportions was significant (p=0.043), whereas the genotype*drinking interaction was not (p=0.061). Similar results were found for the effect of the genotype*smoking/drinking interaction on mean CAL. CONCLUSIONS These findings suggest that the interplay between the host genotype and smoking is important in determining the subgingival microbial composition and periodontitis severity.","Torrungruang, Kitti; Chantarangsu, Soranun; Sura, Thanyachai; Thienpramuk, Lalitsara",Journal of clinical periodontology,https://doi.org/10.1111/jcpe.13307; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32418218/,193

Since the outbreak of the coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, several articles have suggested the potential involvement of vitamin D in reducing the risk and severity of the disease. RECENT FINDINGS Epidemiological and observational studies support the hypothesis of a protective role of vitamin D but most studies are retrospective or based on small samples. However, the pandemic progression and the increased knowledge on the pathogenesis of COVID-19 have challenged the first evidence, suggesting also potential negative consequences derived by adequate vitamin D status. A cautious interpretation of the significance of low vitamin D25OH levels is advisable. The balance between over-activation of innate immunity and the exhaustibility of the adaptive immune response still needs to be clarified. In addition, the modulation of endothelial function, the down-regulation of renin, angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) and angiotensin genes and the up-regulation of ACE2 expression is still an area of research. SUMMARY Speculative hypotheses and observational data have suggested a protective role of vitamin D in COVID-19. However, many unanswered questions remain, aberrant detrimental effects of adequate vitamin D25OH levels cannot be excluded and whether its adequacy may prevent the infection or improve clinical outcomes needs to be assessed by adequately sized and designed population-based studies and intervention trials.","Cereda, Emanuele; Bogliolo, Laura; de Stefano, Ludovico; Caccialanza, Riccardo",Current opinion in clinical nutrition and metabolic care,https://doi.org/10.1097/mco.0000000000000701; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33003119/,193

The Roles of Resilience and Meaning in Life.,2020,"Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are used to treat acid-related disorders such as peptic ulcer and gastroesophageal reflux disease. Recently, vonoprazan, a novel potassium-competitive acid blocker (P-CAB), has been introduced as more effective treatment option. The purpose of this study was to clarify the adverse events associated with vonoprazan compared to PPIs using a spontaneous reporting system database. We performed a retrospective pharmacovigilance disproportionality analysis using the Japanese Adverse Drug Event Report (JADER) database. Adverse event reports submitted to the Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency between 2004 and 2017 were analyzed, and the reporting odds ratio (ROR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) for each adverse event were calculated. The database comprised 11,433 reports associated with PPIs, and 636 reports with vonoprazan. Hepatic and skin disorders were commonly detected in both PPIs and vonoprazan. There was a significant association of interstitial lung disease with PPIs as a class (ROR: 1.61, 95%CI: 1.47-1.77), but not with vonoprazan. Vonoprazan was strongly associated with haemorrhagic enterocolitis (ROR, 86.5; 95%CI, 59.7125). Among the PPIs, the signal score of microscopic colitis was noteworthy in the case of lansoprazole (ROR, 405; 95%CI, 348-472). It is suggested that there is a diversity in the strength of the association between PPIs and vonoprazan with adverse events.

Yet we lack a complete, realistic account of either. Building on control engineering, here we introduce a model for decision making in the brain that reuses a temporally abstracted map of future events to enable biologically-realistic, flexible choice at the expense of specific, quantifiable biases. It replaces the classic nonlinear, model-based optimization with a linear approximation that softly maximizes around (and is weakly biased toward) a default policy. This solution demonstrates connections between seemingly disparate phenomena across behavioral neuroscience, notably flexible replanning with biases and cognitive control. It also provides insight into how the brain can represent maps of long-distance contingencies stably and componentially, as in entorhinal response fields, and exploit them to guide choice even under changing goals.","Piray, Payam; Daw, Nathaniel D",Nature communications,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-021-25123-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34400622/,193

This risk can be reduced by the use of personal protective equipment (PPE). However, shortage of PPE has emerged as an important issue in managing the pandemic in both traditionally high and low-resource areas. A group of clinicians and researchers from thirteen countries representing low, middle, and high-income areas has developed recommendations for optimal utilization of PPE before, during, and after gastrointestinal endoscopy with particular reference to low-resource situations. We determined that there is limited flexibility with regard to the utilization of PPE between ideal and low-resource settings. Some compromises are possible, especially with regard to PPE use, during endoscopic procedures. We have, therefore, also stressed the need to prevent transmission of COVID-19 by measures other than PPE and to conserve PPE by reduction of patient volume, limiting procedures to urgent or emergent, and reducing the number of staff and trainees involved in procedures. This guidance aims to optimize utilization of PPE and protection of health care providers.","Leddin, Desmond; Armstrong, David; Raja Ali, Raja A; Barkun, Alan; Butt, Amna S; Chen, Ye; Khara, Harshit S; Lee, Yeong Yeh; Leung, Wai Keung; Macrae, Finlay; Makharia, Govind; Malekzadeh, Reza; Makhoul, Elias; Sadeghi, Anahita; Saurin, Jean-Christophe; Topazian, Mark; Thomson, Sandie R; Veitch, Andrew; Wu, Kaichun",Journal of clinical gastroenterology,https://doi.org/10.1097/mcg.0000000000001411; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32909973/,193

METHODS A survey asking about six topics within the social determinants of mental health was disseminated to all CAP program directors with email addresses found in the Fellowship and Residency Electronic Interactive Database (FREIDA) (n = 134). Data were exported using the Qualtrics survey platform. RESULTS Fifty-three program directors (40%) responded to the survey. Overall, 98% of program directors felt education on the social determinants of mental health was ""essential"" for fellowship training, but there were significant differences in perceived relative importance and effectiveness of education provided across topics. Familial factors were rated as significantly more important than structural, historical, and economic factors. Structural and historical factors were viewed as being taught less effectively than other factors. Educational, structural, and historical factors and neighborhood factors were allotted significantly less instructional time than familial factors. CONCLUSIONS While there is near-universal consensus that social determinants of mental health education are critical for fellowship training, program directors feel that social determinants of mental health topics differ in importance and are taught at varying levels of effectiveness. These findings highlight the need for intra-institutional and or inter-institutional collaboration for social determinants of mental health educational content development if CAP programs are to prepare trainees to best serve their most vulnerable patients.","Kronsberg, Hal; Bettencourt, Amie F; Vidal, Carol; Platt, Rheanna E",Academic psychiatry : the journal of the American Association of Directors of Psychiatric Residency Training and the Association for Academic Psychiatry,https://doi.org/10.1007/s40596-020-01269-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32691373/,193
148723,Telemental Health Response to the COVID-19 Pandemic: Virtualization of Outpatient Care Now as a Pathway to the Future.,2020-12-08,"BACKGROUND This report describes three Italian centers' experience in the treatment of children with esophageal achalasia. PATIENTS AND METHODS Between June 2000 and June 2012, 31 children (13 girls and 18 boys, with a median age of 8.4 years) affected by esophageal achalasia were treated in three different institutions with an esophagomyotomy according to Heller's procedure via laparoscopy associated with a Dor antireflux procedure. Between 2000 and 2005 (for 14 patients) we used mono- or bipolar coagulation to perform myotomy; after 2005 (for 17 patients) we used the new hemostatic devices to perform it. RESULTS Median length of surgery was 120 minutes. Median hospital stay was 4 days. We recorded eight complications in our series: 3 patients (9.6%) had a mucosal perforation, and 5 children (16.1%) presented dysphagia after surgery. When comparing the data before and after 2005, it seems that the new hemostatic devices statistically shortened the length of surgery (P<.01, Student's t test). CONCLUSIONS On the basis of our experience, laparoscopic Heller's myotomy associated with an antireflux procedure is a safe and effective method for the treatment of achalasia in the pediatric population. Intraoperative complications were <10%, and they occurred mostly at the beginning of our experience. Residual dysphagia occurred in about 16% of cases. The use of the new hemostatic devices seems to reduce the length of surgery and intraoperative bleeding. Considering the rarity of this pathology, we believe that patients with achalasia have to be treated only at centers with a strong experience in the treatment of this pathology.","Esposito, Ciro; Riccipetitoni, Giovanna; Chiarenza, Salvatore Fabio; Roberti, Agnese; Vella, Claudio; Alicchio, Francesca; Fava, Giorgio; Escolino, Maria; De Pascale, Teresa; Settimi, Alessandro",Journal of laparoendoscopic & advanced surgical techniques.

DESIGN Prospective observational study with retrospective data analysis. SETTING Academic medical center surgical ICU. PATIENTS Seventy-two intubated patients with critical illness from coronavirus disease 2019. INTERVENTIONS Therapeutic anticoagulation after imaging diagnosis of the first three deep venous thrombosis cases was confirmed; therapeutic anticoagulation as prophylaxis thereafter to all subsequent ICU admissions. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS Seventy-two patients with severe coronavirus disease 2019 were screened for deep venous thrombosis after ICU admission with 102 duplex ultrasound examinations, with 12 cases (16.7%) of lower extremity deep venous thrombosis identified. There were no differences between groups with respect to age, renal function, or biomarkers except for D-dimer (median, 12,858 ng/mL [interquartile range, 3,176-30,770 ng/mL] for lower extremity deep venous thrombosis vs 2,087 ng/mL [interquartile range, 638-3,735 ng/mL] for no evidence of deep venous thrombosis; p < 0.0001). Clinical screening tools (Wells score and Dutch Primary Care Rule) had no utility. The C-statistic for D-dimer concentration was 0.874 ± 0.065. At the model-predicted cutoff value of 3,000 ng/mL, sensitivity was 100%, specificity was 51.1%, positive predictive value was 21.8%, and negative predictive value was 100%. CONCLUSIONS Lower extremity deep venous thrombosis is prevalent in coronavirus disease 2019 disease and can be present on ICU admission. Screening has been recommended in the context of the pro-inflammatory, hypercoagulable background milieu. D-dimer concentrations are elevated in nearly all coronavirus disease 2019 patients, and the test appears reliable for screening for lower extremity deep venous thrombosis at or above a concentration of 3,000 ng/mL (more than 13-fold above the normal range). Full anticoagulation is indicated if the diagnosis is confirmed, and therapeutic anticoagulation should be considered for prophylaxis, as all coronavirus disease 2019 patients are at increased risk.","Gibson, Cameron J; Alqunaibit, Dalia; Smith, Kira E; Bronstein, Matthew; Eachempati, Soumitra R; Kelly, Anton G; Lee, Christina; Minneman, Jennifer A; Narayan, Mayur; Shou, Jian; Villegas, Cassandra V; Winchell, Robert J; Barie, Philip S",Critical care medicine,https://doi.org/10.1097/ccm.0000000000004614; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32932347/,193

Preventing pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections (STI) during this period is vital to ensuring health and safety. As survival has improved after pediatric solid organ transplantation (SOT), chronically immunosuppressed adolescents seek guidance in their medical home on matters of sexual health. Transplant practitioners often do not feel equipped to fully address these needs. This review serves as an introductory sexual preventive care resource for adolescent and young adult (AYA) SOT recipients. First, we review data on safety, efficacy, and use of contraceptive options currently available for transplant recipients with child-bearing potential. Then, we suggest a personalized sexual health discussion focusing on the diagnosis and prevention of STIs in adolescent and young adult transplant recipients. Finally, we present recommendations for STI screening of asymptomatic patients, use of index of suspicion and diagnostic testing in symptomatic patients, and opportunities to optimize STI prevention strategies. Data compiled from studies of adult SOT recipients, general population studies, and published guidelines are often extrapolated for use, as limited data exist in AYA SOT recipients. This informational dearth underscores the need for future research to better characterize the unique needs of AYA SOT recipients.","Ardura, Monica I; Coscia, Lisa A; Meyers, Melissa R",Pediatric transplantation,https://doi.org/10.1111/petr.13949; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33491268/,193
153807,Experiences of Mental Health Clinicians and Staff in Rapidly Converting to Full-Time Telemental Health and Work from Home During the COVID-19 Pandemic.,2020-12-09,"BACKGROUND Surgical site infections (SSI) remain one of the most common complications in conventional abdominal surgery with an incidence between 4% and 19% (Sandini et al., Medicine (Baltimore) 95:e4057, 2016) in the literature. It is unclear whether the use of coated suture material for skin closure reduces the risk of SSI. In line with in-vitro results, we hypothesize that the use of antibacterial skin sutures (triclosan-coated poliglecaprone 25) reduces the rate of SSI after open abdominal surgery. METHODS/DESIGN To prevent SSI, triclosan-coated poliglecaprone 25 sutures will be tested against un-coated suture material for skin closure after elective open abdominal surgery of 364 patients. The study is planned as a single-center, prospective randomized controlled trial. Patients will be followed for 30 days after surgery to detect and document wound complications. The rate of SSI after 30 days will be analyzed in both groups. DISCUSSION If we can confirm the proposed hypothesis in our study, this could be a promising and feasible approach to lower SSI after open abdominal surgery. By lowering the rate of SSI this might offer a cost-saving and morbidity-reducing procedure. TRIAL REGISTRATION German Clinical Trials Register, DRKS00010047 .

154841,Reflections on Caring.,2020-03-01,"BACKGROUND The World Health Organization recommends exclusive breastfeeding until 6 months followed by introduction of iron-rich complementary foods (CFs). The aim of this study was to determine the impact of different iron-rich CFs on infant gut inflammation and microbiota. METHODS Eighty-seven exclusively breastfed infants were randomly assigned to receive one of the following as their first CF: iron-fortified cereal (Cer), iron-fortified cereal with fruit (Cer + Fr), or meat (M). Urine and stool samples were collected to assess reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, gut microbiota and inflammation. RESULTS Fecal iron differed across feeding groups (p < 0.001); levels were highest in the Cer group and lowest in M group. A significant increase of fecal ROS formation (p < 0.002) after the introduction of CFs was observed, but did not differ across feeding groups. Fecal calprotectin increased within all groups after the introduction of CFs (p = 0.004). Gut microbiota richness increased after introduction of M or Cer + Fr. Regardless of feeding group, Coriobacteriaceae were positively correlated with ROS and Staphylococcaceae were negatively correlated with calprotectin. CONCLUSIONS Choice of first CF may influence gut inflammation and microbiota, potentially due to variations in iron absorption from different foods. Further research is warranted to fully characterize these associations and to establish implications for infant health.

However, most reported case series consist of basic laparoscopic procedures, such as cholecystectomy and appendectomy. In this paper, we present the case of an advanced laparoscopic operation-construction of a gastrointestinal anastomosis-that was performed through ports placed entirely within the umbilicus. METHODS In this paper, we describe a 61-year-old male with a history of advanced pancreatic carcinoma who was referred with a gastric outlet obstruction. A laparoscopic gastrojejunostomy bypass, using a linear stapler with suture closure of the enterotomy, was performed through three abdominal trocars placed entirely within the umbilicus. Some potential advantages of NOTUS palliative gastrojejunostomy include reduced postoperative pain and the lack of visible abdominal scars. RESULTS The operation was completed uneventfully in 40 minutes. The patient recovered without complications and was discharged on postoperative day 2. At 1-month follow-up, the patient had improved oral intake without any further vomiting symptoms. CONCLUSION This case report documents the feasibility of an advanced anastomotic gastrojejunostomy procedure which can be performed through a single site.

OBJECTIVE To determine if platelet mitochondrial respiration increases following CA in a porcine pediatric model of asphyxia-associated ventricular fibrillation (VF) CA, and if this readily obtained biomarker is associated with decreased brain mitochondrial respiration. CA protocol: 7 min of asphyxia, followed by VF, protocolized titration of compression depth to systolic blood pressure of 90 mmHg and vasopressor administration to a coronary perfusion pressure greater than 20 mmHg. PRIMARY OUTCOME platelet integrated mitochondrial electron transport system (ETS) function evaluated pre- and post-CA/ROSC four hours after return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC). Secondary outcome: correlation of platelet mitochondrial bioenergetics to cerebral bioenergetic function. Platelet maximal oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOSCI+CII), P < 0.02, and maximal respiratory capacity (ETSCI+CII), P < 0.04, were both significantly increased compared to pre-arrest values. This was primarily due to a significant increase in succinate-supported respiration through Complex II (OXPHOSCII, P < 0.02 and ETSCII, P < 0.03). Higher respiration was not due to uncoupling, as the LEAKCI + CII respiration (mitochondrial respiration independent of ATP-production) was unchanged after CA/ROSC. Larger increases in platelet mitochondrial respiratory control ratio (RCR) compared to pre-CA RCR were significantly correlated with lower RCRs in the cortex (P < 0.03) and hippocampus (P < 0.04) compared to sham respiration. Platelet mitochondrial respiration is significantly increased four hours after ROSC. Future studies will identify mechanistic relationships between this serum biomarker and altered cerebral bioenergetics function following cardiac arrest.","Ferguson, Michael A; Sutton, Robert M; Karlsson, Michael; Sjövall, Fredrik; Becker, Lance B; Berg, Robert A; Margulies, Susan S; Kilbaugh, Todd J",Journal of bioenergetics and biomembranes,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10863-016-9657-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27020568/,193

157721,Introduction: Telehealth in pediatrics.,2021-02-01,"BACKGROUND Autoregulatory dysfunction is an important contributor to brain injury in premature infants, particularly intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH). The autoregulatory system acts as a filter that dampens the systemic blood flow to follow a normal cerebral perfusion profile. METHODS Simultaneous arterial blood pressure and cerebral near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) data were collected from infants born before 28 wk estimated gestational age. The resulting data were preprocessed and then divided into nonoverlapping 20-min epochs. The transfer function estimate was calculated to determine dampening ability. RESULTS Sixty-two infants were prospectively recruited with a mean estimated gestational age of 25.4 ± 1.3 wk and birth weight of 832 ± 199 g. 67% were male, 24/62 had IVH, 17/62 received dopamine, 47/62 had antenatal steroid exposure, and 22/62 received fentanyl.Advancing estimated gestational age and birth weight z-score predicted stronger dampening while African-American race and IVH of any grade predicted weaker dampening. CONCLUSION This preliminary report suggests an impairment in dampening ability associated with immaturity, decreased birth weight z-score, and African-American race. Decreased dampening is also associated with IVH, although these results cannot distinguish between decreased dampening as an antecedent or sequela of IVH. These observations should be studied in a larger sample.","Vesoulis, Zachary A; Liao, Steve M; Trivedi, Shamik B; Ters, Nathalie El; Mathur, Amit M",Pediatric research,https://doi.org/10.1038/pr.2015.238; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26571222/,193

OBJECTIVES To observe the effects of highly bioactive ECM scaffold on the regeneration and repair of defects in long-segment ureteral replacement. MATERIAL AND METHODS An animal model of long-segment ureteral defect was established and four-layer tubular highly bioactive ECM materials were prepared. After the ureteral defect was repaired through surgery, the rabbits in the negative control group were administered a non-bioactive stent, and rabbits in the observation group were treated with an ECM stent. RESULTS Comparison of macro-indicators: The negative control group had a higher infection rate, a lower survival rate and more complications than the observation group (p < 0.05). The frequency of ureteral peristalsis in the negative control group was lower than in the observation group. In addition, the rate of urinary dysfunction was higher, and the ratio of ureteral diameter was lower in the negative control group than in the observation group (all p < 0.05). Comparison of histopathology: Three months after the operation, the vascular, smooth muscle and mucous membrane of the ureter in the observation group regenerated to close to normal ureteral tissue. There was no significant difference between the ureter regeneration in the repair area and the normal ureter tissue in the observation group 3 months after the operation. The number of regenerated muscle fibers in the observation group was significantly higher than that of the negative control group. Compared with the negative control group, the fibrous capsule was thicker, the percentages of CD31, CD3, CD68, CD80+, and CD163+ were higher, the scope of new smooth muscle fiber was expanded, fusion with the host muscle fibers was higher, and the neuromuscular junction (NMJ) structure was stronger in the observation group (all p < 0.05).

MATERIALS AND METHODS A retrospective review of our prospectively maintained database identified all patients treated by the Silk stent in 2 institutions. Clinical charts, procedural data, and angiographic results were reviewed. RESULTS Between July 2009 and May 2014, we identified 58 patients with 70 intracranial aneurysms. Endovascular treatment was successful in 93% of patients with 32 treated with the first-generation Silk stent and 26 with the new Silk+ stent. Mean follow-up in 47 patients was 22 months. Despite an 11% delayed complication rate, overall permanent neurologic morbidity was 5.5%. All complications were seen with the first-generation Silk stent. There was no procedure-related mortality. Long-term anatomic results showed 73% with complete occlusion, 16% with neck remnants, and 11% with incomplete occlusion. No recanalization or retreatment was performed. The midterm intrastent stenosis rate was 57%, of which 60% improved or disappeared, 28% were stable, and 12% led to vessel occlusion. Seventy-four percent of stenosis and all vessel occlusions occurred with the first-generation Silk stent. CONCLUSIONS Endovascular treatment of complex intracranial aneurysms with the Silk stent is an effective therapeutic option. Despite a high rate of delayed complications with the first-generation stents, the current Silk+ stent appears safer. This treatment achieves a high rate of adequate and stable occlusion at long-term follow-up.","Lubicz, B; Van der Elst, O; Collignon, L; Mine, B; Alghamdi, F",AJNR.

160980,Documented Reasons of Cancellation and Rescheduling of Telehealth Appointments During the Pandemic.,2020-12-28,"During infection, viruses hijack various host cell components and programs for their amplification, among which is the canonical ERK signaling pathway, mainly consisting of three tiered serine/threonine kinases, Raf, MEK and ERK. MEK1 and MEK2 are two isoforms of the kinase operating immediately upstream of ERK, and connecting Raf and ERK by phosphorylating ERK. Previous studies have suggested that different isoforms of MEK have distinct biological functions, although their in vitro kinase function may be redundant. However, little is known about the isoform-specific effects of these kinases on viral propagation. In this study, we showed that herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) infection of human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells induced a sustained activation of ERK1/2. Inhibition of this ERK activation by U0126, a specific inhibitor of MEK1/2, severely impaired virus production. A similar reduction of virus production was also seen following transfection of cells with siRNAs for MEK1/2. Interestingly, a specific knockdown of MEK1 with siRNAs caused a marked inhibition of viral titers, viral proteins and virus-induced cytopathic effect (CPE), whereas silencing MEK2 had little effect. Therefore, our results demonstrate that MEK1 and MEK2 act differently and that HSV-2 hijacks host MEK1 for its own amplification. To our knowledge, this is the first report showing inhibition of HSV-2 replication by targeting human MEK1. This study also suggests that MEK1 could be a potential target for anti-HSV-2 therapy, which may minimize damage to the host cells engendered by targeting both MEK1 and MEK2.","Zhang, Hao; Feng, Hai; Luo, Lingqi; Zhou, Qi; Luo, Zhijun; Peng, Yihong",Virus research,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virusres.2010.02.007; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20172001/,193

Design/methodology/approach To model the behavior of COVID-19 disease, a system dynamics model is developed in this paper based on SEIR model. In the proposed model, the impact of people's behavior, contact reduction, isolation of the sick people as well as public quarantine on the spread of diseases is analyzed. In this model, data collected by the Iran Ministry of Health have been used for modeling and verification of the results. Findings The results show that besides the intervening policies, early application of them is also of utmost priority and makes a significant difference in the result of the system. Also, if the number of patients with extreme conditions passes available hospital intensive care capacity, the death rate increases dramatically. Intervening policies play an important role in reducing the rate of infection, death and consequently control of pandemic. Also, results show that if proposed policies do not work before the violation of the hospital capacity, the best policy is to increase the hospital's capacity by adding appropriate equipment. Research limitations/implications The authors also had some limitations in the study including the lack of access to precise data regarding the epidemic of coronavirus, as well as accurate statistics of death rate and cases in the onset of the virus due to the lack of diagnostic kits in Iran. These parameters are still part of the problem and can negatively influence the effectiveness of intervening policies introduced in this paper. Originality/value The contribution of this paper includes the development of SEIR model by adding more policymaking details and considering the constraint of the hospital and public health capacity in the rate of coronavirus infection and death within a system dynamics modeling framework.","Abdolhamid, M.

Environmental adversity is key in youth suicidality, hence there is a need to study stressors that disproportionately impact Black youths. We aimed to disentangle the unique contribution of racial/ethnic discrimination from other adversities associated with childhood suicidal ideation and attempts (suicidality) across races. Method: We analyzed data from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study that included a large, diverse sample of US children (N=11,235, mean age 10.9 years, 20.2% Black) phenotyped for environmental adversities including discrimination. Multivariate regression models tested the association of self-reported racial/ethnic discrimination with suicidality, covarying for multiple confounders including other discrimination types (towards non-US born individuals; sexual orientation-based; weight-based). Matched analyses contrasted effects of racial/ethnic discrimination and racial identity on suicidality. Results: Black youths reported more discrimination and higher suicidality rates than non-Black youths. High racial/ethnic discrimination was positively associated with suicidality, adjusting for other discrimination types (odds ratio [OR]=2.6, 95%CI=2.1-3.2). Findings remained significant after adjusting for multiple suicidality risk factors. Once experienced, racial/ethnic discrimination was similarly associated with suicidality in White, Black, and Hispanic youths. Matched analyses revealed that racial/ethnic discrimination was associated with suicidality (relative risk [RR]=2.7, 95%CI=2-3.5), while Black race was not (RR=0.9, 95%CI=0.7-1.2). Conclusion: Racial/ethnic discrimination is disproportionately experienced by Black children, and is associated with preadolescent suicidality, over and above other adversities. Findings highlight the need to address discrimination as part of suicide prevention strategies. Cross-sectional design hampers causal inferences.","Argabright, S. T.; Visoki, E.; Moore, T.

170661,Mental health outcomes among health care workers during the coronavirus-19 pandemic,2021,"The Th2 cytokines IL-4 and IL-13 through activation of their shared receptor IL-4Rα direct macrophage alternative activation to promote immunosuppression and wound healing. However, the mechanisms that control macrophage responses to IL-4/13 are not fully understood. Apart from driving JAK-STAT and PI3K-Akt pathways to polarize macrophages toward the alternative phenotype, the activated IL-4/13 receptors recruit negative regulators SHP-1 and SHP-2, which dephosphorylate IL-4Rα and decrease its signaling. Here we report that SIRPα spatially restricts SHP-2 and, by such, promotes IL-4/13 signaling and macrophage alternative activation. SIRPα executes this regulation via its cytoplasmic ITIMs/ITSMs that undergo phosphorylation by IL-4/13-induced, Src kinase-activated Bruton’s tyrosine kinase (Btk), resulting in recruitment of SHP-2 and preclusion of SHP-2 from binding to and inhibiting IL-4/13 receptors. Despite that this regulation occurs independent of CD47, extracellular CD47 ligation of SIRPα facilitates its cytoplasmic phosphorylation and SHP-2 sequestration, leading to stronger IL-4/13 signaling and enhanced macrophage expression of IL-10, TGFβ, CD206, arginase-1, etc. Conversely, deficiency of SIRPα allows SHP-2 to freely bind to γC or IL-13Rα1 and through which dephosphorylate IL-4Rα, dampening its signaling. Consistent with these findings, impaired wound healing in Sirpα−/− mice under experimental colitis correlated with a deficit of immunosuppressive macrophages in the colon, a condition that was corrected by transfusion of ex vivo-produced SIRPαhigh alternatively activated macrophages.","Shi, Lei; Kidder, Koby; Bian, Zhen; Chiang, Samantha Kuon Ting; Ouellette, Corbett; Liu, Yuan",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.08.06.455421,193

Sixty-two studies met inclusion criteria, of which 69% (n=42) were identified as being methodologically weak. The best-available evidence constitutes findings from four methodologically strong studies, and ten moderate studies which are not confounded by additional promotions such as price or availability. These studies predominantly found evidence that in-premise marketing is likely to be successful in influencing consumer behaviour towards targeted items, across retail and out-of-home settings. These findings provide a basis for authorities to consider acting to restrict in-premise marketing of unhealthy foods and encouraging the in-premise marketing of healthier products. This review identified gaps in the evidence available on non-sales outcomes, and on online purchase environments. These gaps, and identified methodological limitations of the extant evidence remain to be addressed by future research.","Whitehead, R.; Greci, S.; Thomson, H.; Armour, G.; Angus, K.; Martin, L.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.09.13.21258115v1?rss=1,193

The WHO defines “comparative assessment of virus characteristics and public health risks” as primary action in response to the emergence of new SARS-CoV-2 variants. Here, we demonstrate that the Mu variant is highly resistant to sera from COVID-19 convalescents and BNT162b2-vaccinated individuals. Direct comparison of different SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins revealed that Mu spike is more resistant to serum-mediated neutralization than all other currently recognized variants of interest (VOI) and concern (VOC). This includes the Beta variant (B.1.351) that has been suggested to represent the most resistant variant to convalescent and vaccinated sera to date (e.g., Collier et al, Nature, 2021; Wang et al, Nature, 2021). Since breakthrough infection by newly emerging variants is a major concern during the current COVID-19 pandemic (Bergwerk et al., NEJM, 2021), we believe that our findings are of significant public health interest. Our results will help to better assess the risk posed by the Mu variant for vaccinated, previously infected and naïve populations.","Uriu, Keiya; Kimura, Izumi; Shirakawa, Kotaro; Takaori-Kondo, Akifumi; Nakada, Taka-aki; Kaneda, Atsushi; Nakagawa, So; Sato, Kei",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.09.06.459005,193

This article examines the place of Shih's rhinoceros sculptures in this ""Endless Circle of Life,"" beginning with the European journeys of two historical rhinoceroses, Ganda who arrived in Portugal in 1515, and Clara who was displayed in Venice in 1751. The article outlines Shih's idiosyncratic collage of themes from Eastern and Western history, philosophy, spirituality and mythology, and his perception of the rhinoceros as powerful but threatened, as expressed in his motto ""Strength and Vulnerability."" The animal's vulnerability has been fuelled by its long history of exploitation for profit. Though it remains an object of commodification today-in some societies rhinoceros horn is revered as the ultimate gift-there has recently been a discernible shift in the way these magnificent animals are viewed, a shift away from exploitation and which Shih claims drives his work. Despite his expressed intentions, however, this paper suggests that, perhaps unwittingly, the marketing of his work serves to extend the long history of human exploitation of the rhinoceros. Finally, the commodification of Venice and its Biennale, at which ""King Kong Rhino"" was exhibited, is discussed in the context of the current COVID-19 pandemic.","Dickenson, J.",Luxury-History Culture Consumption,https://doi.org/10.1080/20511817.2020.1864601,193

While interpersonal synchrony is considered a multimodal phenomenon, it is not clear how different biological and behavioral synchrony markers are related to each other. The current study, thus, addresses whether INS is functionally-distinct from synchrony in other systems – specifically the autonomic nervous system (ANS) and motor behavior. To test this, we used a novel methodological approach, based on concurrent functional near-infrared spectroscopy-electrocardiography, recorded while N = 34 mother-child and stranger-child dyads (child mean age 14 years) engaged in cooperative and competitive tasks. Results showed a marked differentiation between neural, ANS and behavioral synchrony. Importantly, only in the neural domain was higher synchrony for mother-child compared to stranger-child dyads observed. Further, ANS and neural synchrony were positively related during competition but not during cooperation. These results suggest that synchrony in different behavioral and biological systems may reflect distinct processes. Mother-child INS may arise due to neural processes related to social affiliation, which go beyond shared arousal and similarities in behavior.","Reindl, Vanessa; Wass, Sam; Leong, Victoria; Scharke, Wolfgang; Wistuba, Sandra; Wirth, Christina Lisa; Konrad, Kerstin; Gerloff, Christian",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.02.21.432077,193

As an official ECHO hub, MLG recently completed a large-scale, TeleECHO series on treating to guidelines and managing cardiovascular and renal risk in patients with T2DM, consisting of 47 sessions that reached 1976 healthcare professionals. With the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, these sessions provided a unique way to facilitate a case-based dialogue among community-based practitioners and a national expert, sharing best practices that to apply to the care of individual patients. MLG recorded each session and used the most informative cases to create an enduring activity that is available for one year online. To further support the translation of education into practice and encourage HCP-patient dialogue, MLG also provided learners access to an online Personalized Poster Portal. Learners could choose a variety of images and design a poster that was shipped to their practice setting. There have been 613 poster orders thus far. The outcomes that MLG has collected regarding this unique program and its point-of-care tools indicate how CME can lead to not only improved knowledge but can also translate to practice behavior. While learners demonstrated significant gains across learning objectives, baseline knowledge of the latest data on the use of GLP-1 receptor agonists and SGLT2inhibitors to reduce cardiovascular events demonstrated a need for such education.

178770,The Impact of the COVID-19 Crisis on Middle-income Countries,2021,"The decreasing cost of DNA sequencing has led to a great increase in our knowledge about genetic variation. While population-scale projects bring important insight into genotype-phenotype relationships, the cost of performing whole-genome sequencing on large samples is still prohibitive. In-silico genotype imputation coupled with genotyping-by-arrays is a cost-effective and accurate alternative for genotyping of common and uncommon variants. Imputation methods compare the genotypes of the typed variants with the large population-specific reference panels and estimate the genotypes of untyped variants by making use of the linkage disequilibrium patterns. Most accurate imputation methods are based on the Li-Stephens hidden Markov model, HMM, that treats the sequence of each chromosome as a mosaic of the haplotypes from the reference panel. Here we assess the accuracy of local-HMMs, where each untyped variant is imputed using the typed variants in a small window around itself (as small as 1 centimorgan). Locality-based imputation is used recently by machine learning-based genotype imputation approaches. We assess how the parameters of the local-HMMs impact the imputation accuracy in a comprehensive set of benchmarks and show that local-HMMs can accurately impute common and uncommon variants and can be relaxed to impute rare variants as well.

Unfortunately, structured clinical data, such as encounter diagnostic codes in electronic health records, suffer from multiple limitations and biases, limiting effective learning. We hypothesized that a machine learning approach to automate ascertainment of clinical events and disease history from medical notes would improve upon using structured data and enable the estimation of real-world risks. We sought to test this approach to address a timely goal: estimating the delayed risk of adverse cardiovascular events (i.e. after the index infection) in patients infected with respiratory viruses. Using 4,151 cardiologist-labeled notes as gold standard, we trained a series of neural network models to automate event adjudication for heart failure hospitalization, acute coronary syndrome, stroke, and coronary revascularization and to identify past medical history for heart failure. Though performance varied by task, in nearly all cases, our models surpassed the use of structured data in terms of sensitivity for a given specificity level and enabled principled evaluation of classification thresholds, which is typically impossible to do with diagnostic codes. Deploying our models on more than 17 million notes for 267,596 patients across an extensive integrated delivery network, we found that patients infected with respiratory syncytial virus had a 23% increased risk of delayed heart failure hospitalization over a subsequent 4-year period compared with propensity-score matched patients who had the same test but with negative results (p = 0.003, log-rank). In contrast, we found no such increased risk in patients with a positive influenza viral test compared with a negative test (rate ratio 0.98, p = 0.71). We conclude that convolutional neural network-based models enable accurate clinical labeling at scale, thereby unlocking timely insights from unstructured clinical data.","Goto, S.; Homilius, M.; John, J.

183895,The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health among healthcare workers in ear-nose-throat clinics.,2021-05-11,"COVID-19 is considered to be one of the crises that occurred at the end of 2019. It seems that the chain of crises never ends, and the occurrence of events is unavoidable. Normally, declaring an emergency for the hospital's medical staff is the first reaction from the health authorities in each country concerning all crises. Thus, the medical staff will start their activities to rescue, transfer, hospitalize and release of the injured people. According to health regulations, the surveillance system must promptly expand its activity based on crisis recognition, including the continuous and regular collection of data related to public health, aggregation, analysis, and assessment of the health status (1). A common element of crises is the lack of time to make accurate and timely decisions (2). Although some commentators believe that the social nature of COVID-19 is different from other crises (3), the experience gained from other crises can be useful. World Health Organization (WHO) has currently faced a major challenge in confronting COVID-19. So, their only reference to deal with this crisis is using previously recorded experiences about other similar coronaviruses, such as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome(MERS) and some of the published information from other countries involved in the crisis. There is some documentation available in databases, but the vast experience of medical staff has been neglected. There is a chance that each medical staff had valuable experiences that would be forgotten over time. Indeed, medical staff is one of the main groups involved in dealing with the crisis and certainly gain much experience in this area. Therefore, health practitioners can use the experience of medical staff as tacit knowledgerepositories to manage crises during them or in case of facing future ones because their experiences are considered as primary information sources. In this regard, in order to reduce the extent of damages, costs, and human casualties, the approach of recording and sharing their experiences should be taken into consideration at the national and even global levels. Authors have tried to address this important topic as well as the features of this database to encourage health managers to design it and to encourage medical staff to record and share their experiences.","Panahi, S.; Rizi, H.

In this communication, we demonstrate that the RNA genomes of different strains of murine coronaviruses recombine during mixed infection at a very high frequency. Susceptible cells were coinfected with a temperature-sensitive mutant of one strain of mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) and a wild-type virus of a different strain. Of 21 randomly isolated viruses released from the coinfected cells at the nonpermissive temperature, 2 were recombinants which differed in the site of recombination. After three serial passages of the original virus pool derived from the mixed infection, the majority of the progeny viruses were recombinants. These recombinant viruses represented at least five different recombination sites between the two parental MHV strains. Such a high-frequency recombination between nonsegmented RNA genomes of MHV suggests that segmented RNA intermediates might be generated during MHV replication. We propose that the RNA replication of MHV proceeds in a discontinuous and nonprocessive manner, thus generating free segmented RNA intermediates, which could be used in RNA recombination via a copy-choice mechanism.","Makino, S; Keck, J G; Stohlman, S A; Lai, M M",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3005623/,193

Expression of the gene encoding open reading frame (ORF) 6b of FIPV in recombinant vaccinia virus infected cells was used to identify it as the 6b protein. It is a novel type of viral glycoprotein whose function is not clear. It is a soluble protein contained in microsomes; its slow export from the cell is caused by the presence of an ER-retention signal at the C-terminus. This amino acid sequence, KTEL, closely resembles the consensus KDEL-signal of soluble resident ER proteins. A mutant 6b protein with the C-terminal sequence KTEV became resistant to digestion by endo-beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase H with a half-time that was reduced threefold. In contrast, a mutant with the sequence KDEL was completely retained in the ER. The FIPV 6b protein is the first example of a viral protein with a functional KDEL-like ER-retention signal.","Vennema, H; Heijnen, L; Rottier, P J; Horzinek, M C; Spaan, W J",Advances in experimental medicine and biology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8209732/,193

The disease is rarely fatal in adult animals but can cause extensive mortality in the neonate. Since its first description in Britain in the 1950s, the disease has been epizootic but recently it has become established on some farms and an antigenically related respiratory virus has become endemic in the national herd over the past two years. Piglet immunity to TGE, which relies on passive protection from milk, has been impossible to achieve with vaccines and research has aimed at understanding the nature of the interaction between virus and the pig. Following infection of the pregnant sow, antibody-producing cells migrate to the mammary gland where they secrete virus neutralising antibodies into the milk; prospective vaccines will need to stimulate a similar response. The location and number of antigenic sites on the virus particle associated with neutralisation have been established with monoclonal antibodies and the role of the other viral genes in pathogenesis and immunity is being studied with genetic engineering techniques.","Garwes, D J",The Veterinary record,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2839932/,193
195786,"COVID-19: Adaptations and changes at Guinness Eye Centre, Nigeria.",2020,"BACKGROUND Mosquito coil (MC) is widely used to repel mosquitoes in order to prevent malaria in many malaria-endemic countries. Although we are fully aware and concerned about carbon monoxide (CO) and its toxicity, exposure to CO from common, though occult sources like MC smoke is often overlooked. Equally, the adverse health effects, especially to the brain, are usually underestimated. OBJECTIVE To assess the effects of exposure to CO from MC smoke inhalation on spatial memory in mice. METHODS Sixteen, adult, male, mice, were randomly assigned to either the experimental or the control group; each having 8 mice. The experimental group was exposed to the MC smoke (Wavetide, China) that was allowed to burn inside the gas chamber (75 cm x 50 cm x 50 cm) for 15 minutes, daily, for 14 days. Digital CO meter (PCMM05 Pyle) was used to measure the amount of CO and Barnes maze protocol to assess the spatial memory. RESULTS Our results indicate that burning MC for 15 minutes produced up to 312 parts per million (ppm) of CO and raised the blood carboxy-hemoglobin (COHb) level by 15.8%. This is higher than the WHO recommended limit (<100 mg/m3 or 87 ppm for 15 min.) of CO exposure and the %COHb level of <2%. Mosquito coil smoke was also associated with impaired spatial memory. However, the dose and duration of exposure did not significantly affect weight gain in the mice. CONCLUSION Although widely used to prevent malaria, MC could serve as a potential source of CO and other neurotoxins that could be harmful to the brain; the use and toxicity of which is mostly overlooked even by the public health professionals.","Kurawa, Musa Ibrahim; Magaji, Rabiu AbduSSalam; Yusuf, Tanko; Magaji, Mohammed Garba",Nigerian journal of physiological sciences : official publication of the Physiological Society of Nigeria,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33084618/,193

Significant inter-individual differences have been observed during the course of the infection, which suggests that genetic susceptibility may be a contributing factor. CC chemokine receptor 5 (CCR5), which acts as a co-receptor for the entry of HIV-1 into cells, is promising candidate whose can have an influence on SARS-CoV-2 infection. A genetic mutation known as CCR5Delta32, consisting of a 32-nucleotide deletion, encodes a truncated protein that protects homozygous carriers of the deletion from HIV-1 infection. Similarly, inhibition of CCR5 seems to be protective against COVID-19. In our study, we successfully genotyped 416 first-wave SARS-CoV-2-positive infection survivors (164 asymptomatic and 252 symptomatic) for CCR5?32, comparing them with a population based sample of 2,404 subjects. We found the highest number (P=0.03) of CCR5Delta32 carriers in SARS-CoV-2-positive/COVID-19-asympto-matic subjects (23.8 %) and the lowest number in SARS-CoV-2-positive/COVID-19-symptomatic patients (16.7 %), with frequency in the control population in the middle (21.0 %).

We present a detailed analysis of the protein synthesis of the mutant viruses at the permissive (31 degrees C) and nonpermissive (39.5 degrees C) temperatures. It was found that synthesis of the nucleocapsid protein N and the membrane protein M of both viruses was insensitive to temperature. However, the surface protein S of both viruses was retained in the endoplasmic reticulum at the nonpermissive temperature. This was shown first by analysis of endoglycosidase H-treated and immunoprecipitated labeled S proteins. The mature Golgi form of S was not present at the nonpermissive temperature for the ts viruses, in contrast to wild-type (wt) virus. Second, gradient purification of immunoprecipitated S after pulse-chase labeling showed that only wt virus S was oligomerized. We conclude that the lack of oligomerization causes the retention of the ts S proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum. As a result, ts virus particles that were devoid of S were produced at the nonpermissive temperature. This result could be confirmed by biochemical analysis of purified virus particles and by electron microscopy.","Luytjes, W; Gerritsma, H; Bos, E; Spaan, W",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8995612/,193

The coronavirus that causes severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV) utilizes the receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) to infect cells. Here we compare human, mouse, and rat ACE2 molecules for their ability to serve as receptors for SARS-CoV. We found that, compared to human ACE2, murine ACE2 less efficiently bound the S1 domain of SARS-CoV and supported less-efficient S protein-mediated infection. Rat ACE2 was even less efficient, at near background levels for both activities. Murine 3T3 cells expressing human ACE2 supported SARS-CoV replication, whereas replication was less than 10% as efficient in the same cells expressing murine ACE2. These data imply that a mouse transgenically expressing human ACE2 may be a useful animal model of SARS.","Li, Wenhui; Greenough, Thomas C; Moore, Michael J; Vasilieva, Natalya; Somasundaran, Mohan; Sullivan, John L; Farzan, Michael; Choe, Hyeryun",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15452268/,193
202582,"Blood coagulation parameters in patients with severe COVID-19 from Kermanshah Province, Islamic Republic of Iran",2020,"The response to the COVID-19 pandemic is a tragic aberration gripping the world. As the disease evolves, uncertainty and fear of harm rise, which can significantly diminish community health and wellbeing. This article stresses the importance of public health preparedness in overcoming social and health risks associated with public panic.Since the COVID-19 outbreak began in late 2019, the numbers of people affected and fatalities continue to mount, causing panic and crippling vital economic and social activities. Authorities have failed to prevent inaccurate and misleading headlines that agitate the public and impinge on public communication. Fake news and rumors about magical products claiming to cure the virus abound. Additionally, people assumed emergency preparation meant stockpiling resources. Amid growing fears, consumers raided supermarkets and pharmacies for supplies, from masks to hygiene products, and people have fought over protective gear as tensions flared among anxious customers.When general panic starts driving political decision-making, public health professionals may be unable to implement strategies based on informed decisions. Researchers argue that government secrecy and non-transparency diminish people?s confidence and trust, creating panic (Wilson et al., 2007). Even naming the disease possibly triggered epidemic-related trauma and the ensuing public mistrust and disbelief of authorities;the panic has also sparked a wave of racial prejudice (Titanji, 2020). Although a series of emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases, from Avian flu to Zika virus, may have created more public awareness, whether leaders can translate this newfound awareness into meaningful policies and action is debatable.Globally, attention is growing on responses from state leaders, as some try to downplay the epidemic?s severity to maintain ?business as usual?. In early March 2020, the Indonesian government was still in a state of denial and was attempting to convince the general public that the country was free from COVID-19 (Lindsey & Mann, 2020) Instead, currently confirmed cases are growing rapidly, suspected cases are far above the testing capacity, and case fatality is at an alarming rate.In contrast, several countries took drastic action by declaring travel restrictions and locking down cities. As an example, New Zealand decided to implement level-4 measures, with strict movement restrictions, not long after they confirmed their first case on 28 February 2020;they have recently begun a gradual exit from coronavirus lockdown (Knight, 2020).The public expects leaders to curb the spread of COVID-19 responsibly, appropriately, effectively, and proactively. Meanwhile, leaders are urging the public to stay calm and adopt new norms during this rapidly evolving situation. This crisis is not limited to any individual and requires cooperation rather than a unilateral response.�DISCUSSIONHow to do this?A critical approach to pandemics is to ensure the preparedness of both healthcare capacity and public health systems (Jain, Duse, & Bausch, 2018). To respond to emergency needs?to have the capacity to treat rapidly increasing numbers of COVID-19 patients?it is important for each country to have existing policies and action plans for healthcare facilities to temporarily expand service capacity, cancel or postpone elective procedures, and engage in rapid intervention to conserve medical supplies, including personal protective equipment (Gan, Tseng, & Lee, 2020). Measures including recalling recently retired healthcare workers and providing drive-through services for chronic disease medications have been implemented to lessen pressures on hospitals (Wang, Ng, & Brook, 2020).While healthcare capacity is the ability to care for patients with COVID-19, the public health system aims to prevent people from being infected and mitigating the health risks associated with COVID-19. The public health system is important for strengthening community vigilance by promoting effective sanitation, a healthy lifestyle, and food safety, and preventing injuries, inequality, and violence. This involves not only healthcare professionals, but also well-planned strategies that consider various stakeholders? perspectives and concerns (Glik, 2007). Despite the lockdown, we have seen healthcare workers and people in the community providing the basic essentials for those in need?from food, Personal Protective Equipment (PPE), mental health support, and evidence-based research communication, to virtual musical performances and concerts. Organizations in the virtual sphere, including WhatsApp (WhatsApp Inc, 2020) and TikTok, are partnering with health agencies to increase accessibility to health information.The best outbreak response is a collective response (Gille & Brall, 2020), which could effectively contain the disease and the panic caused by the disease. People naturally experience fear when dealing with a catastrophic event. This unprecedented threat triggered panic purchasing or falling for viral hoaxes, which reflects misconceptions about the problem, most likely because people lack trust in the measures taken (Heide, 2004), When designing and implementing public health measures, we must ensure we do not just acknowledge that, but actively engage relevant stakeholders. In an age of uncertainty, community solidarity and collective action are key to maintaining community vigilance against the crisis (Aldrich et al., 2015).","Gan, Connie Cr; Dwirahmadi, Febi",Jurnal Berkala Epidemiologi,,193

DESIGN: Nationwide mortality registries. SETTING: 605 urban districts and rural counties in China's nationally representative Disease Surveillance Point (DSP) system. PARTICIPANTS: More than 300 million people of all ages. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Observed overall and weekly mortality rates from all cause and cause specific diseases for three months (1 January to 31 March 2020) of the covid-19 outbreak compared with the predicted (or mean rates for 2015-19) in different areas to yield rate ratio. RESULTS: The DSP system recorded 580 819 deaths from January to March 2020. In Wuhan DSP districts (n=3), the observed total mortality rate was 56% (rate ratio 1.56, 95% confidence interval 1.33 to 1.87) higher than the predicted rate (1147 v 735 per 100 000), chiefly as a result of an eightfold increase in deaths from pneumonia (n=1682; 275 v 33 per 100 000; 8.32, 5.19 to 17.02), mainly covid-19 related, but a more modest increase in deaths from certain other diseases, including cardiovascular disease (n=2347; 408 v 316 per 100 000; 1.29, 1.05 to 1.65) and diabetes (n=262; 46 v 25 per 100 000; 1.83, 1.08 to 4.37). In Wuhan city (n=13 districts), 5954 additional (4573 pneumonia) deaths occurred in 2020 compared with 2019, with excess risks greater in central than in suburban districts (50% v 15%). In other parts of Hubei province (n=19 DSP areas), the observed mortality rates from pneumonia and chronic respiratory diseases were non-significantly 28% and 23% lower than the predicted rates, despite excess deaths from covid-19 related pneumonia. Outside Hubei (n=583 DSP areas), the observed total mortality rate was non-significantly lower than the predicted rate (675 v 715 per 100 000), with significantly lower death rates from pneumonia (0.53, 0.46 to 0.63), chronic respiratory diseases (0.82, 0.71 to 0.96), and road traffic incidents (0.77, 0.68 to 0.88). CONCLUSIONS: Except in Wuhan, no increase in overall mortality was found during the three months of the covid-19 outbreak in other parts of China. The lower death rates from certain non-covid-19 related diseases might be attributable to the associated behaviour changes during lockdown.","Liu, Jiangmei; Zhang, Lan; Yan, Yaqiong; Zhou, Yuchang; Yin, Peng; Qi, Jinlei; Wang, Lijun; Pan, Jingju; You, Jinling; Yang, Jing; Zhao, Zhenping; Wang, Wei; Liu, Yunning; Lin, Lin; Wu, Jing; Li, Xinhua; Chen, Zhengming; Zhou, Maigeng",BMJ,,193

The main symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 are dry cough, fever, and fatigue. COVID-19 appears to affect all systems, including renal, cardiovascular, circulatory, and respiratory systems, causing chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. We report on a 14-year-old male adolescent, who presented with thrombocytopenia (platelet count 92 × 109 /L) and leukopenia (white blood count 4.2 × 103 /μL) that was observed two months ago. Ten days before the first blood test, a viral infection with nasal congestion and runny nose was reported, without other accompanying symptoms. Viral antibodies screening revealed positivity for all the three specific COVID-19 antibodies. Further haematological evaluation with bone marrow aspiration revealed non-specific dysplastic features of the red cell and megakaryocyte progenitors. Although haematological alterations due to COVID-19 infection are available from adult patients’ reports, the effect of COVID-19 infection in the pediatric population is underestimated and this is the first case with such haematological involvement. Noteworthy, in the current case, the impact of the COVID-19 infection was not related to the severity of the disease, as the symptoms were mild. In similar cases, bone marrow aspiration would not be performed as a part of routine work-up. Thus, it is important when evaluating pediatric patients with COVID-19 infection to search and report those alterations in order to better understand the impact and the spectrum of clinical manifestations of the specific viral infection in children and adolescents.","Kossiva, Lydia Thirios Athanasios Panagouli Eleni Panos Alexandros Lampidi Stavroula Bacopoulou Flora Tsolia Maria Tsitsika Artemis",Children,,193

209252,Telepsychotherapie als Chance und Herausforderung: Eine longitudinale Mixed-Methods Studie,2021,"Cuba implemented policies mandating social distancing on March 11, 2020, which were still in place at the time of this study. During such periods of isolation, people with psychoactive substance-related disorders and other addictions may be tempted to reduce tension, stress, uncertainty and possible distress by increasing the use of substances or practices they have abused. This can mean relapses and setbacks for patients undergoing treatment. A multidisciplinary team of health professionals specializing in addiction at the Center for Academic Development in Drug Addiction, in Havana, Cuba, cares for people with these disorders and followed their evolution during the initial period of COVID-19 social isolation. With the aim of characterizing strategies employed by patients undergoing treatment for substance abuse and addictions, we conducted a qualitative study from April 2020 through May 2020, using a convenience sample of 37 patients (all students) who had been progressing towards recovery from addictive behaviors when face-to-face encounters were suspended due to COVID-19 restrictions. Contact was maintained through information and communication technologies. The research used telepsychology and focused on understanding patient life experiences. Patients were interviewed using a semi-structured survey, which was then transcribed and coded thematically using a grounded-theory approach. We found that patients' ability to cope successfully with challenges presented by COVID-19 were influenced by: 1) the individual's own methods for maintaining self-control (commitment to studies, projects, and work with therapists) that aided them in their goals concerning abstinence; 2) difficulties faced in addressing specific events and situations (doubts, uncertainties, disagreements, isolation and time use); 3) perpetuation and revivification of myths related to substances and addictive activities (exacerbation of supposed benefits of tobacco, alcohol, marijuana, overuse of social networks); and 4) tendencies toward irrationality and lack of emotional control (fear, sadness, anger, constant worry and self-imposed demands). Our findings suggest that despite the potential negative psychological impact of preventive social isolation during the COVID-19 pandemic, individual coping mechanisms developed by these patients, aiming at improved self-control, allowed most to avoid setbacks that could have affected their recovery. Nevertheless, patients faced challenges to their recovery that were compounded by difficulties in specific situations, myths related to substances and addictive activities, and tendencies toward irrationality or lack of emotional control.","Fabelo-Roche, Justo R; Iglesias-Moré, Serguei; Gómez-García, Ana M",MEDICC Rev,,193

Among the study participants, only 8 (1.7%) were screened for IPV. IPV was reported 3.27 times more often by women who reported that their partner chewed Khat compared with those women whose partner did not (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 3.27; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.45-7.38), and 1.52 times more often women who reported that their partner drank alcohol compared with those women whose partner did not (aOR 1.52; 95% CI 1.01-2.28). CONCLUSION: Very few women were screened for IPV. Partners drinking alcohol and chewing Khat are significantly positively associated with IPV during pregnancy. IPV screening should be included in the national management protocol of obstetric cases of Ethiopia.","Teshome, Abel; Gudu, Wondimu; Bekele, Delayehu; Asfaw, Mariamawit; Enyew, Ruhama; Compton, Sarah D",Int. j. gynaecol. obstet,,193

211557,Racial Disparities in COVID-19 Hospitalization and In-hospital Mortality at the Height of the New York City Pandemic,2020,"Many research teams all over the world focus their research on the SARS-CoV-2, the new coronavirus that causes the so-called COVID-19 disease. Most of the studies identify the main protease or 3C-like protease (Mpro/3CLpro) as a valid target for large-spectrum inhibitors. Also, the interaction of the human receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) with the viral surface glycoprotein (S) is studied in depth. Structural studies tried to identify the residues responsible for enhancement/weaken virus-ACE2 interactions or the cross-reactivity of the neutralizing antibodies. Although the understanding of the immune system and the hyper-inflammatory process in COVID-19 are crucial for managing the immediate and the long-term consequences of the disease, not many X-ray/NMR/cryo-EM crystals are available. In addition to 3CLpro, the crystal structures of other nonstructural proteins offer valuable information for elucidating some aspects of the SARS-CoV-2 infection. Thus, the structural analysis of the SARS-CoV-2 is currently mainly focused on three directions-finding Mpro/3CLpro inhibitors, the virus-host cell invasion, and the virus-neutralizing antibody interaction.","Ionescu, Mihaela Ileana",Protein J,,193

The virus is originated in bats and transported to humans via undefined intermediate animals. This virus can produce from weak to severe respiratory diseases including acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS), pneumonia and even death in patients. The COVID-19 disease is distributed by inhalation via contaminated droplets or contact with infected environment. The incubation time is from 2 to 14 day and the symptoms are typically fever, sore throat, cough, malaise, fatigue, breathlessness among others. It needs to be considered that many infected people are asymptomatic. Developing various immunological and virological methods to diagnose this disease is supported by several laboratories. Treatment is principally supportive; however, there are several agents that are using in treating of COVID-19 patients. Interferons (IFNs) have shown to be crucial in fighting with COVID-19 disease and can be a suitable candidate in treatment of these patients. Combination therapy can be more effective than monotherapy to cure this disease. Prevention necessitates to be performed by isolation of suspected people and home quarantine as well as taking care to infected people with mild or strict disease at hospitals. As the outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 has accelerated, developing effective therapy is an urgent requirement to battle the virus and prevent further pandemic. In this manuscript we reviewed available information about SARS-CoV-2 and probable therapies for COVID-19 patients.","Haji Abdolvahab, Mohadeseh; Moradi-Kalbolandi, Shima; Zarei, Mohammad; Bose, Deepanwita; Majidzadeh-A, Keivan; Farahmand, Leila",Int Immunopharmacol,,193

No study based standard treatment is established. Usually therapy protocols for bronchopulmonary carcinoids are used. So far no data exist on the effect of mTOR-inhibitors. We describe our long term experience with everolimus and give a thorough review of the therapeutic strategies used so far. PATIENTS AND METHODS: 4 patients (mean age 46 years, range 37-55) with progressing thymic NEN (two well differentiated atypical carcinoids and two atypical carcinoids with large cell characteristics) were treated with everolimus 10 mg/d after failure of at least one previous medical therapy. Everolimus was applied after a mean interval of 32.4 months (range 5 - 56) after first diagnosis. The follow up included clinical examination, imaging, and chromogranin A testing in 3 or 6 monthly intervals. RESULTS: We observed stable disease for a mean of 20.8 months. Both patients with large cell characteristics thymic NEN (Ki-67 of 20 %) had rapid progress after 7 and 10 months and had more previous therapies (3 and 6) than the patients with well differentiated thymic NEN (Ki-67 5 % and 10 %, progress after 24 and 42 months, 1 and 2 previous therapies). No severe side effects occurred. In 3 out of 4 patients everolimus led to stable disease for the longest, compared to the other non surgical therapies used. CONCLUSION: Comparing the sparse data available everolimus is a promising treatment for thymic NEN at least in second line therapy. A low Ki-67 index was associated with a better outcome.

Discussion: Parasitic infections are more frequent in the developing countries; in our case the transposition of small intestinal loop surely promoted the migration of Taenia Saginata throught the gastro-jejunal anastomosis into the gastric stump.Preoperative evaluation (history, physical examination and imaging features) led to gastric cancer diagnosis and hindered the recognition of the taeniasis because of similar clinical presentations and the need to start quickly a therapeutic oncological strategy. Conclusion: Even if these cases are exceptional especially in Western Europe, it is important to obtain a detail clinical history and exclude parasistic infection as a cause of loss of weight and gastrointesinal abnormalities.","Albertini, Nicola; Pecchini, Francesca; Esposito, Sofia; Gozzo, Davide; Colli, Giovanni; Piccoli, Micaela",,,193

SARS-CoV-2 spreads primarily through exposure to respiratory droplets expelled by infected individuals. This exposure may occur if a person touches his/her mouth, nose or eyes after contact with a contaminated surface. Elevators are small enclosed spaces used in a wide variety of settings and often see multiple users in quick succession. This puts users at risk of contracting COVID-19 and other diseases that follow similar transmission patterns. The ongoing pandemic shows us a need to redesign current systems, including elevators to prevent the transmission of such diseases. Current methods rely on manual cleaning and disinfection of elevator cabins, which is time and manpower consuming. Elevator hygiene protocols such hand sanitization and wearing masks depend on user compliance. This work proposes a system for the automatic disinfection of elevator cabins using UV-C light. This is done in a manner that does not disrupt regular elevator operation, which is controlled using a microcontroller. In order to further improve safety standards, physical buttons are replaced with touch-less ones using ultrasonic sensors. © 2020 IEEE.","Akshat, Nanda V.; Singhal, A.; Jindal, S.

The viral diseases induced by mammalian and avian viruses from Coronaviridae family pose significant economic and public health burdens. Due to increasing reports of viral resistance, co-infections and the emergence of viral epidemics such as COVID-19, available antiviral drugs show low or no efficacy, and the production of new treatments or vaccines are also challenging. Therefore, demand for the development of novel antivirals has considerably increased. In recent years, antiviral peptides have generated increasing interest as they are from natural and computational sources, are highly specific and effective, and possess the broad-spectrum activity with minimum side effects. Here, we have made an effort to compile and review the antiviral peptides with activity against Coronaviridae family viruses. They were divided into different categories according to their action mechanisms, including binding/attachment inhibitors, fusion and entry inhibitors, viral enzyme inhibitors, replication inhibitors and the peptides with direct and indirect effects on the viruses. Reported studies suggest optimism with regard to the design and production of therapeutically promising antiviral drugs. This review aims to summarize data relating to antiviral peptides particularly with respect to their applicability for development as novel treatments.","Heydari, Hamid; Golmohammadi, Reza; Mirnejad, Reza; Tebyanian, Hamid; Fasihi-Ramandi, Mahdi; Moosazadeh Moghaddam, Mehrdad",Peptides,,193

We compared 30-day hospitalization/re-hospitalization and clinical outcomes between patients on chronic DOAC therapy and patients not on oral anticoagulation (OAC) therapy at time of COVID-19 diagnosis. METHODS: We used data from TriNetX, a global federated health research network. Patients aged &#8805;18 years who were treated with DOACs at time of COVID-19 diagnosis between 20 January 2020 and 28 February 2021 were included, and matched with patients not on OAC therapy from the same period. All patients were followed-up at 30-days after COVID-19 diagnosis. The primary outcomes were all-cause mortality, hospitalization/re-hospitalization, venous thromboembolism (VTE) and intracranial hemorrhage (ICH). RESULTS: 738,423 patients were included. After propensity score matching (PSM), 26,006 patients remained in the study (13,003 on DOACs; 13,003 not on OAC). DOAC-treated patients (mean age 67.1 ± 15.4 years, 52.2% male) had higher relative risks (RRs) and lower 30-days event-free survival as compared to patients not on OAC for all-cause mortality (RR 1.27, 95% CI 1.12-1.44; Log-Rank test p = 0.010), hospitalization/re-hospitalization (RR 1.72, 95% CI 1.64-1.82; Log-Rank test p < 0.001) and VTE (RR 4.51, 95% CI 3.91-5.82; Log-Rank test p < 0.001), but not for ICH (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.54-1.51; Log-Rank test p = 0.513).

However, medical jargon and the complex structure of professional language in this domain make health information especially hard to interpret. Thus, there is an urgent unmet need for automated methods to enhance the accessibility of the biomedical literature to the general population. This problem can be framed as a type of translation problem between the language of healthcare professionals, and that of the general public. In this paper, we introduce the novel task of automated generation of lay language summaries of biomedical scientific reviews, and construct a dataset to support the development and evaluation of automated methods through which to enhance the accessibility of the biomedical literature. We conduct analyses of the various challenges in solving this task, including not only summarization of the key points but also explanation of background knowledge and simplification of professional language. We experiment with state-of-the-art summarization models as well as several data augmentation techniques, and evaluate their performance using both automated metrics and human assessment. Results indicate that automatically generated summaries produced using contemporary neural architectures can achieve promising quality and readability as compared with reference summaries developed for the lay public by experts (best ROUGE-L of 50.24 and Flesch-Kincaid readability score of 13.30).

To the question ""Have you made healthier changes to your dietary habits compared with the dietary habits before the spread of COVID-19 (1 year ago, November 2019)?"", 1215 (20.3%), 491 (8.2%), and 4294 (71.6%) participants answered that their dietary habits were healthier, unhealthier, and unchanged, respectively. Healthier and unhealthier dietary habits were associated with greater fear of COVID-19, altered exercise and sleep times, and smoking. Unhealthy habits were positively associated with living alone, decreasing household income, colleagues with COVID-19, stress, and weight loss/gain. Annual household income, changing household income, COVID-19 in friends, health literacy, exercise frequency, weight loss, and starting smoking were positively associated with healthier dietary changes. The generalizability of these results and strategies to inculcate healthy diets in this ""new normal"" should be investigated.","Shimpo, Misa; Akamatsu, Rie; Kojima, Yui; Yokoyama, Tetsuji; Okuhara, Tsuyoshi; Chiba, Tsuyoshi",Nutrients,,193
229090,Standardizing the Accommodations Process for Health Care Workers During COVID-19,2021,"The emergence of superbugs developing resistance to antibiotics and the resurgence of microbial infections have led scientists to start an antimicrobial arms race. In this context, we have previously identified an active RiPP, the Ruminococcin C1, naturally produced by Ruminococcus gnavus E1, a symbiont of the healthy human intestinal microbiota. This RiPP, subclassified as a sactipeptide, requires the host digestive system to become active against pathogenic Clostridia and multidrug-resistant strains. Here we report its unique compact structure on the basis of four intramolecular thioether bridges with reversed stereochemistry introduced posttranslationally by a specific radical-SAM sactisynthase. This structure confers to the Ruminococcin C1 important clinical properties including stability to digestive conditions and physicochemical treatments, a higher affinity for bacteria than simulated intestinal epithelium, a valuable activity at therapeutic doses on a range of clinical pathogens, mediated by energy resources disruption, and finally safety for human gut tissues.","Roblin, Clarisse; Chiumento, Steve; Bornet, Olivier; Nouailler, Matthieu; Müller, Christina S; Jeannot, Katy; Basset, Christian; Kieffer-Jaquinod, Sylvie; Couté, Yohann; Torelli, Stéphane; Le Pape, Laurent; Schünemann, Volker; Olleik, Hamza; De La Villeon, Bruno; Sockeel, Philippe; Di Pasquale, Eric; Nicoletti, Cendrine; Vidal, Nicolas; Poljak, Leonora; Iranzo, Olga; Giardina, Thierry; Fons, Michel; Devillard, Estelle; Polard, Patrice; Maresca, Marc; Perrier, Josette; Atta, Mohamed; Guerlesquin, Françoise; Lafond, Mickael; Duarte, Victor",Proc.

Early diagnosis is an essential key to limit the outbreak of the virus. STUDY DESIGN: Case series, study conducted between March 25, 2020, and April 15, 2020. SETTING: Ambulatory, nonhospitalized patients who were quarantined in a designated hotel for COVID-19 patients and were recruited by an advertisement at the hotel. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: In total, 140 patients participated in a web-based questionnaire assessing initial symptoms of common viral diseases, olfactory and taste functions, xerostomia, and orofacial pain. RESULTS: A total of 58 men and 70 women participated. Initial symptoms were cough (59.4%), weakness (47.7%), myalgia (46.9%), fever (42.2%), headache (40.6%), impaired sense of smell (38.3%), impaired sense of taste (32.8%), sore throat (26.6%), runny nose (26.6%), and nasal congestion (22.7%). All symptoms were more frequent among women; however, only runny nose was statistically significant (P = .018). The most common combination of symptoms was cough and weakness (37.5%). A total of 25.8% reported olfactory and taste dysfunctions in the absence of other symptoms. In a comparison between the sexes, cough and runny nose were the most common combination in women (P = .018). A total of 38.3% of patients reported olfactory dysfunction as an initial symptom. Anosmia and facial pain were more common among women (P < .001 and P = .01, respectively), and 56% of patients reported xerostomia. CONCLUSION: A considerable number of patients presented with olfactory and oral disorders. Interestingly, women presented with a different cluster of symptoms than men, which may suggest a new clinical approach to diagnosing COVID-19 disease.","Biadsee, Ameen; Biadsee, Ameer; Kassem, Firas; Dagan, Or; Masarwa, Shchada; Ormianer, Zeev",Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg,,193
229788,Case Reports of COVID 19 Recurrence,2021,"Purpose: Recently, the world has been dealing with a new type of coronavirus called COVID-19 that in terms of symptoms is similar to the SARS coronavirus. Unfortunately, researchers could not find a registered therapy to treat the infection related to the virus yet. Regarding the fact that drug repurposing is a good strategy for epidemic viral infection, we applied the drug repurposing strategy using virtual screening to identify therapeutic options for COVID-19. For this purpose, five proteins of COVID-19 (3-chymotrypsin-like protease (3CLpro), Papain-Like protease (PLpro), cleavage site, HR1 and RBD in Spike protein) were selected as target proteins for drug repositioning. Methods: First, five proteins of COVID-19 were built by homology modeling. Then FDA-approved drugs (2471 drugs) were screened against cleavage site and RBD in Spike protein via virtual screening. One hundred and twenty-eight FDA-approved drugs with the most favorable free-binding energy were attached to the cleavage site and RBD in Spike protein. Of these 128 drugs, 18 drugs have either been used currently as antiviral or have been reported to possess antiviral effects. Virtual screening was then performed for the 18 selected drugs with ACE2, 3CLpro and PLpro and HR1 and TMPRSS2. Results: According to the results, glecaprevir, paritaprevir, simeprevir, ledipasvir, glycyrrhizic acid, TMC-310911, and hesperidin showed highly favorably free binding energies with all tested target proteins. Conclusion: The above-mentioned drugs can be regarded as candidates to treat COVID-19 infections, but further study on the efficiency of these drugs is also necessary.","Mahdian, Soodeh; Ebrahim-Habibi, Azadeh; Zarrabi, Mahboobeh",J Diabetes Metab Disord,,193

For example, protective equipment is now being extensively used, which was otherwise only used in selected situations. Working in such an environment is to be evaluated differently under the aspect of occupational safety than other patient care, especially as more than 1900 suspected cases of a SARS-CoV-19 occupational disease were reported among healthcare workers in Germany. Even in a pandemic, the legal requirements remain valid and personal protective equipment (PPE) has to comply with given standards. The use of FFP3 masks is required in aerosol-forming situations, such as endotracheal intubation or bronchoscopy. In contrast to surgical face masks, there is a maximum wearing time for FFPs masks. Furthermore, in a pandemic there is a basic danger of PPE shortage and recycling of face masks is under discussion. Therefore, usage of non-EU certified PPE may come into effect but this has to follow the requirements defined by European regulations.

We also aimed to model key determinants of worry in the early stage of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States. A total of 806 participants completed an online survey in late March 2020. Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses assessed scale structure. Factor analysis stratified by depression was used to assess measurement invariance. Linear regression models examined COVID-19-related worry determinants. The CoV-Wo scale exhibited good reliability (&#945; = 0.80) and a two-factor structure: health (&#945; = 0.83) and resources (&#945; = 0.71). The full scale and both subscales were higher among participants who stopped working due to COVID-19 and those with depression. Perception of quality medical care if infected with COVID-19 was associated with reduced worry. The CoV-Wo scale is a low burden assessment of COVID-19-related worry, that captures common worries in domains affected by COVID-19 and can be used to develop psychosocial resources.","Dayton, Lauren; Schneider, Kristin; Strickland, Justin C; Latkin, Carl",,,193

Interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) is a key transcription factor activated in response to virus infection and is largely responsible for establishing an antiviral state in the infected host. Studies in Irf3-/- mice have demonstrated the absence of IRF3 imparts a high degree of susceptibility to a wide range of viral infections. Virus infection causes the activation of IRF3 to transcribe type-I interferon (e.g., IFNß), which is responsible for inducing the interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs), which act at specific stages to limit virus replication. In addition to its transcriptional function, IRF3 is also activated to trigger apoptosis of virus-infected cells, as a mechanism to restrict virus spread within the host, in a pathway called RIG-I-like receptor-induced IRF3 mediated pathway of apoptosis (RIPA). These dual functions of IRF3 work in concert to mediate protective immunity against virus infection. These two pathways are activated differentially by the posttranslational modifications (PTMs) of IRF3. Moreover, PTMs regulate not only IRF3 activation and function, but also protein stability. Consequently, many viruses utilize viral proteins or hijack cellular enzymes to inhibit IRF3 functions. This review will describe the PTMs that regulate IRF3's RIPA and transcriptional activities and use coronavirus as a model virus capable of antagonizing IRF3-mediated innate immune responses. A thorough understanding of the cellular control of IRF3 and the mechanisms that viruses use to subvert this system is critical for developing novel therapies for virus-induced pathologies.","Glanz, Anna; Chakravarty, Sukanya; Varghese, Merina; Kottapalli, Anita; Fan, Shumin; Chakravarti, Ritu; Chattopadhyay, Saurabh",Viruses,,193
237231,The Relationship between Anxiety and Depression Levels with Perceived Stress and Coping Strategies in Health Care Workers during the COVID-19 Pandemic,2021,"The global outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), as of 8 May 2021, has surpassed 150 700 000 infections and 3 279 000 deaths worldwide. Evidence indicates that SARS-CoV-2 RNA can be detected on particulate matter (PM), and COVID-19 cases are correlated with levels of air pollutants. However, the mechanisms of PM involvement in the spread of SARS-CoV-2 remain poorly understood. Here, we found that PM exposure increased the expression level of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2) in several epithelial cells and increased the adsorption of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Instillation of PM in a hACE2 mouse model significantly increased the expression of ACE2 and Tmprss2 and viral replication in the lungs. Furthermore, PM exacerbated the pulmonary lesions caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection in the hACE2 mice. In conclusion, our study demonstrated that PM is an epidemiological factor of COVID-19, emphasizing the necessity of wearing anti-PM masks to cope with this global pandemic.","Zhu, Teng-Yu; Qiu, Huan; Cao, Qi-Qi; Duan, Zi-Lei; Liu, Feng-Liang; Song, Tian-Zhang; Liu, Yang; Fang, Ya-Qun; Wu, Guang-Ming; Zheng, Yong-Tang; Ding, Wen-Jun; Lai, Ren; Jin, Lin",Zool Res,,193

The aim of this study is to report the nationwide consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic on unplanned hospital attendances in Denmark for 7 weeks after a 'shelter at home' order was issued. METHODS: We merged data from national registries (Civil Registration System and Patient Registry) to conduct a study of unplanned (excluding outpatient visits and elective surgery) hospital-based healthcare and mortality of all Danes. Using data for 7 weeks after the 'shelter at home' order, the incidence rate of unplanned hospital attendances per week in 2020 was compared with corresponding weeks in 2017-2019. The main outcome was hospital attendances per week as incidence rate ratios. Secondary outcomes were general population mortality and risk of death in-hospital, reported as weekly mortality rate ratios (MRRs). RESULTS: From 2 438 286 attendances in the study period, overall unplanned attendances decreased by up to 21%; attendances excluding COVID-19 were reduced by 31%; non-psychiatric by 31% and psychiatric by 30%.

One method to highlight the health and social benefits of new oral health initiatives is to use cost benefit analysis to show their value. AIM: To demonstrate how Cost Benefit Analysis (CBA) has been applied to two recent oral health initiatives to evaluate their ability to reduce costs and improve the quality of life. METHODS: CBA was applied to the Mouth Care Matters project in Kent, Surrey and Sussex, and the Senior Smiles project - improving oral health in residential homes in Australia. RESULTS: Over a five-year period, the Mouth Care Matters project would generate £2.66 in cost savings, within the healthcare system, for every £1 spent. Over a three year period the Senior Smiles project would generate a cost saving for the healthcare system of $3.14 for every $1 spent. These evaluations were instrumental to enable a national rollout for Mouth Care Matters and a public endorsement of the programme for Senior Smiles. CONCLUSIONS: Health economics can be a useful tool in aiding care organisations to assess the implications of decisions to spend limited resources in particular areas of healthcare over others.","Mann, J; Doshi, M; Quentin, L; Eaton, K; Morton-Holtham, L",Community dent. health,,193

METHODS: Patients followed in a single rheumatology department in France or registered on the Spondy+ platform, a secure e-health platform for spondyloarthritis patients, were invited to complete a questionnaire focused on their experiences around COVID19 symptoms, testing and medications access during the lockdown period. Descriptive statistics were used to report questionnaire's results. Factors associated with COVID-19 or with treatment discontinuation were assessed by logistic regression. RESULTS: We obtained 655 answers from the 2,081 contacted patients: 474 with spondyloarthritis, 129 with rheumatoid arthritis and 52 with psoriatic arthritis. The population was predominantly female (61.8%) with a mean age of 51.0 ± 13.4 years. Incidence of COVID-19 was 6.9% (95%CI: 5.1-9.2%)), including 12 confirmed and 33 highly-suspicious cases. No death was observed and five patients needed to be hospitalized. Factors independently associated with an increased risk of infection were SARS-CoV-2 exposure, younger age and non-smoking. More than 30% of the patients suspended or decreased the dosage of one of their drugs during the lockdown period. This was followed in 63.4% of them by increased disease activity. Modifications were mostly motivated by fear of contagion (79.3%). CONCLUSION: We did not observe any increase of incidence or severity of COVID-19 in patients suffering of the 3 most common CIRDs.

Based on severe COVID-19 infections, first experiences with abdominal CEUS examinations are presented. In the stage of an imminent organ failure with significantly reduced kidney and liver function, CEUS can be used to show a narrowing of the organ-supplying arteries, as well as a delayed capillary filling of vessels near the capsule, a regional reduced parenchymal perfusion or an inflammatory hyperemia with capillary hypercirculation. It is possible to quickly rule out organ infarction and to dynamically record the mesenteric arterial and venous blood flow.","Jung, E M; Stroszczynski, C; Jung, F",Clin Hemorheol Microcirc,,193
245841,I want to champion the role of nurses working in primary care,2021,"Today's large-scale algorithms have become immensely influential, as they recommend and moderate the content that billions of humans are exposed to on a daily basis. They are the de-facto regulators of our societies' information diet, from shaping opinions on public health to organizing groups for social movements. This creates serious concerns, but also great opportunities to promote quality information. Addressing the concerns and seizing the opportunities is a challenging, enormous and fabulous endeavor, as intuitively appealing ideas often come with unwanted {\it side effects}, and as it requires us to think about what we deeply prefer. Understanding how today's large-scale algorithms are built is critical to determine what interventions will be most effective. Given that these algorithms rely heavily on {\it machine learning}, we make the following key observation: \emph{any algorithm trained on uncontrolled data must not be trusted}. Indeed, a malicious entity could take control over the data, poison it with dangerously manipulative fabricated inputs, and thereby make the trained algorithm extremely unsafe. We thus argue that the first step towards safe and ethical large-scale algorithms must be the collection of a large, secure and trustworthy dataset of reliable human judgments. To achieve this, we introduce \emph{Tournesol}, an open source platform available at \url{https://tournesol.app}. Tournesol aims to collect a large database of human judgments on what algorithms ought to widely recommend (and what they ought to stop widely recommending). We outline the structure of the Tournesol database, the key features of the Tournesol platform and the main hurdles that must be overcome to make it a successful project. Most importantly, we argue that, if successful, Tournesol may then serve as the essential foundation for any safe and ethical large-scale algorithm.","Hoang, Le-Nguyen; Faucon, Louis; Jungo, Aidan; Volodin, Sergei; Papuc, Dalia; Liossatos, Orfeas; Crulis, Ben; Tighanimine, Mariame; Constantin, Isabela; Kucherenko, Anastasiia; Maurer, Alexandre; Grimberg, Felix; Nitu, Vlad; Vossen, Chris; Rouault, S'ebastien; El-Mhamdi, El-Mahdi",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2107.07334v1.pdf,193

Particularly alarming are load-altering (demand-side) cyberattacks launched through high-wattage assets, which are not continuously monitored by electric power utilities. Electric Vehicle Charging Stations (EVCSs) are among such high-wattage assets and, therefore, cyber insurance can be an effective mechanism to protect EVCSs from economic losses caused by cyberattacks. This paper presents a data-driven cyber insurance design model for public EVCSs. Under some mildly restrictive assumptions, we derive an optimal cyber insurance premium. Then, we robustify this optimal premium against uncertainty in data and investigate the risk of insuring the EVCSs using Conditional Value-at-Risk. A case study with data from EVCSs in Manhattan, New York illustrates our results.","Acharya, Samrat; Mieth, Robert; Konstantinou, Charalambos; Karri, Ramesh; Dvorkin, Yury",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2107.03954v1.pdf,193

The massive spread of misinformation brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as the easy access to various media channels, may affect acceptance of a vaccine, despite the inherent trust in the local system. This cross-sectional study evaluated the knowledge, attitudes, and practice (KAP) in Oman toward COVID-19 vaccines. It included 3000 randomly selected adults answering a structured questionnaire via telephone. Participants were 66.7% Omani, 76% male, and 83.7% without comorbidities. Their mean age was 38.27 years (SD ± 10.45). Knowledge of COVID-19′s symptoms, mode of transmission, and attitudes toward the disease was adequate;88.4% had heard of the vaccine, 59.3% would advise others to take it, 56.8% would take it themselves, and 47.5% would take a second dose. Males (CI = 2.37, OR = (2.00–2.81)) and non-Omanis (CI = 0.49, OR = (0.42–0.57)) were more willing to be vaccinated. The history of chronic disease, source of vaccine knowledge, and education level were factors that affected the willingness to accept the vaccine. The Omani community’s willingness to take the COVID-19 vaccine can be enhanced by utilizing social media and community influencers to spread awareness about the vaccine’s safety and efficacy.","Al-Marshoudi, Sabria Al-Balushi Haleema Al-Wahaibi Adil Al-Khalili Sulien Al-Maani Amal Al-Farsi Noura Al-Jahwari Adhari Al-Habsi Zeyana Al-Shaibi Maryam Al-Msharfi Mahfoodh Al-Ismaili Ahlam Al-Buloshi Hood Al-Rawahi Bader Al-Barwani Khalifa Al-Abri Seif",Vaccines,,193

How reliable are the otoliths measurements to predict the length and age of P. lineatus? Finally, we propose predictive equations of the length and weight of the fish using length and weight of the otolith. The otoliths were sampled from individuals collected in the Upper Paraná River floodplain during 2012 and 2013 years. The relationships among the otolith measurements and both length and weight of the fish were performed using linear regressions. To test whether the length and weight of the otolith differ between the sampled sites, Variance Analysis was performed. Finally, we made analysis of Kruskal-Wallis to verify if the measurements obtained through the otoliths could be used to distinguish the age of the fish. We demonstrate that the length and weight of the otolith are good proxies to predict the length and weight of the fish. Although some ages were statistically different, this result does not support the idea that the age of the fish can be accurately inferred only using otolith measures.(AU)","Santana, Herick Soares de; Rodrigues, Amanda Cantarute; Minte-Vera, Carolina Viviana",Neotrop. ichthyol,,193

There is an urgent need, therefore, to find a proper treatment for the novel coronavirus, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative agent. This paper focuses on identifying inhibitors that target SARS-CoV-2 proteases, PLPRO and 3CLPRO, which control the duplication and manages the life cycle of SARS-CoV-2. We have carried out detailed in silico Virtual high-throughput screening using Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved drugs from the Zinc database, COVID-19 clinical trial compounds from Pubchem database, Natural compounds from Natural Product Activity and Species Source (NPASS) database and Maybridge database against PLPRO and 3CLPRO proteases. After thoroughly analyzing the screening results, we found five compounds, Bemcentinib, Pacritinib, Ergotamine, MFCD00832476, and MFCD02180753 inhibit PLPRO and six compounds, Bemcentinib, Clofazimine, Abivertinib, Dasabuvir, MFCD00832476, Leuconicine F inhibit the 3CLPRO. These compounds are stable within the protease proteins' active sites at 20ns MD simulation. The stability is revealed by hydrogen bond formations, hydrophobic interactions, and salt bridge interactions. Our study results also reveal that the selected five compounds against PLPRO and the six compounds against 3CLPRO bind to their active sites with good binding free energy. These compounds that inhibit the activity of PLPRO and 3CLPRO may, therefore, be used for treating COVID-19 infection.","Jade, Dhananjay; Ayyamperumal, Selvaraj; Tallapaneni, Vyshnavi; Joghee Nanjan, Chandrasekar Moola; Barge, Sagar; Mohan, Surender; Nanjan, Moola Joghee",Eur J Pharmacol,,193

Governments around the world are facing a tough challenge that could jeopardise the national healthcare systems. Safeguarding the rights of Covid patients and all citizens - especially those who are now even more vulnerable than they were before - is part of this challenge. This work aims to examine the issues arising from the current emergency in terms of how individuals' constitutional rights have been balanced and how much people at the highest risk amid this pandemic - the homeless, the inmates in prison, geriatric and psychiatric patients, and doctors on the Covid frontline - have been protected. This analysis focuses mostly on one of the worst-hit countries by the SARS-CoV-2: Italy.","Cioffi, A; Ruggiero, M; Rinaldi, R",Clin Ter,,193

A systematic review,2021,"In 2019, a novel severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19)) caused a global pandemic. There was an urgent need to develop a vaccine against COVID-19 to reduce its spread and economic burden. The main objective of this study was to understand the attitudes and concerns of healthcare workers (HCWs) towards the upcoming COVID-19 vaccine, whether their decision was influenced by their history of taking the seasonal influenza vaccine, and factors that influence the acceptance of the upcoming COVID-19 vaccine. This was a cross-sectional study conducted in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. We selected and surveyed 356 HCWs via an electronic self-administered questionnaire. A total of 61.16% of HCWs were willing to receive the COVID-19 vaccine, and 55.9% of them had received the seasonal influenza vaccine in the preceding year (2019–2020). The strongest predictors for taking the COVID-19 vaccine were the HCWs’ belief that the COVID-19 vaccine would be safe, needed even for healthy people, that all HCWs should be vaccinated against COVID-19, and that HCWs will have time to take the vaccine. Being female, being middle aged, having &lt;5 years of work experience, having no fear of injections, and being a non-smoker were predictive factors for taking the upcoming COVID-19 vaccine. No associations were found between the intention to take the COVID-19 vaccine and a history of taking the seasonal influenza vaccine.","Baghdadi, Leena R.; Alghaihb, Shatha G.; Abuhaimed, Alanoud A.; Alkelabi, Dania M.; Alqahtani, Rawan S.",Vaccines,,193
254860,Learning From the Experiences of COVID-19 Survivors: Web-Based Survey Study,2021,"Viruses are change-prone entities often used as models to study evolutionary mechanisms. SARS-CoV-2 has shown a rapid adaptation to its new host, the human. In addition, it is now widely considered to be the most infectious RNA viral particle in humans, due to both efficiency in transmission mechanisms and exposure. Despite the large number of published articles that shed light on this virus, there is no analysis of the quantitative change in the ultrastructure of SARSCoV-2, although it is a useful tool for understanding the evolutionary pattern. To avoid the emergence of at least three completely different viruses, it should appear that an effective vaccine contains the diversification of the SARS-CoV-2 evolutionary tree. In addition, a greater understanding of the physicochemical characteristics acquired by each of the viral haplotypes is required. In the meantime, the following discussion is offered to update developments in this research topic and to relate them so we can answer questions that, until now, have not been addressed.","Harsha, N.

The lack of efficacious drugs and vaccines against this viral infection created a challenge for scientific researchers in order to find effective solutions. One of the promising therapeutic approaches is the search for bioactive molecules with few side effects that display antiviral properties in natural sources like medicinal plants and vegetables. Several computational and experimental studies indicated that flavonoids especially flavonols and their derivatives constitute effective viral enzyme inhibitors and possess interesting antiviral activities. In this context, the present study reviews the efficacy of many dietary flavonols as potential antiviral drugs targeting the SARS-CoV-2 enzymes and proteins including Chymotrypsin-Like Protease (3CLpro), Papain Like protease (PLpro), Spike protein (S protein) and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), and also their ability to interact with the angiotensin-converting enzyme II (ACE2) receptor. The relationship between flavonol structures and their SARS-CoV-2 antiviral effects were discussed. On the other hand, the immunomodulatory, the anti-inflammatory and the antiviral effects of secondary metabolites from this class of flavonoids were reported. Also, their bioavailability limitations and toxicity were predicted.","Mouffouk, Chaima; Mouffouk, Soumia; Mouffouk, Sara; Hambaba, Leila; Haba, Hamada",Eur J Pharmacol,,193
256699,"Assessing knowledge, attitude, practice, and preparedness of hospital pharmacists in Lebanon towards COVID-19 pandemic: a cross-sectional study",2020,"Increased mortality rates from infectious diseases is a growing public health concern. Successful management of acute bacterial infections requires early diagnosis and treatment, which are not always easy to achieve. Structural imaging techniques such as computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are often applied to this problem. However, these methods generally rely on secondary inflammatory changes and are frequently not specific to infection. The use of nuclear medicine (NM) techniques can add crucial complementary information, allowing visualization of infectious pathophysiology beyond morphologic imaging. This review will discuss the current structural and functional imaging techniques used for the diagnosis of bacterial infection and their roles in different clinical scenarios. We will also present several new radiotracers in development, with an emphasis on probes targeting bacteria-specific metabolism. As highlighted by the current COVID-19 epidemic, caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, similar thinking may apply in imaging viral pathogens; for this case prominent effects on host proteins most notably ACE2 might also provide worthwhile imaging targets.","Polvoy, Ilona; Flavell, Robert R; Ohliger, Michael; Rosenberg, Oren; Wilson, David M",J. nucl. med,,193

As a result, a major proportion of elective surgeries was postponed. However, various emergency and urgent procedures were allowed. Due to the mortality complications of hepatopancreatobiliary issues, we decided to afford urgent procedures under intensive protective arrangements. Method and results: In our ward (liver transplant), 4 ICU beds and 16 ward beds were allocated to non-COVID-19 patients. A total of 36 hepatopancreatobiliary procedures were managed for one month. All the surgeries were afforded under personal protective equipment and other intensive protective arrangements for personnel and patients. During 6 weeks following the surgery, all patients were followed up through telemedicine and no new case of COVID-19 was detected. Conclusion: In general, it appears that intensive protections could significantly reduce the number of COVID-19 incidence among patients with co-morbidities who undergo invasive procedures.","Tasa, Davood; Eslami, Pegah; Dashti, Habibollah; Nassiri Toosi, Mohsen; Zarghami, Seyed Yahya; Jafarian, Ali",Acta Biomed,,193

However, variability in specimen quality can alter the Ct values obtained from SARS-CoV-2 clinical assays. We sought to define how variable nasopharyngeal (NP) swab quality impacts clinical SARS-CoV-2 test sensitivity. Methods: We performed amplification of a human gene target (beta-actin) in parallel with a clinical RT-PCR targeting the SARS-CoV-2 ORF1ab gene for 1282 NP specimens collected from patients with clinical concern for COVID-19. We evaluated the relationship between NP specimen quality, characterized by late Ct values for the human gene target beta-actin Ct, and the probability of SARS-CoV-2 detection via logistic regression, as well as the linear relationship between SARS-CoV-2 and beta-actin Ct. Results: Low-quality NP swabs are less likely to detect SARS-CoV-2 (odds ratio, 0.607 [95% credible interval {CrI}, .487-.753]). We observed a positive linear relationship between SARS-CoV-2 and beta-actin Ct values (slope, 0.181 [95% CrI, .097-.264]), consistent with a reduction in detection of 0.181 cycles for each additional cycle of the beta-actin target. COVID-19 disease severity was not associated with beta-actin Ct values. Conclusions: Variability in NP specimen quality significantly impacts the performance of clinical SARS-CoV-2 assays, and caution should be taken when interpreting quantitative SARS-CoV-2 Ct results. If unrecognized, low-quality NP specimens, which are characterized by a low level of amplifiable human DNA target, may limit the successful application of SARS-CoV-2 Ct values to direct infection control and public health interventions.","Richard-Greenblatt, M.; Ziegler, M.

OBJECTIVE: This study was to compare patient satisfaction of telemedicine clinic to in-person visits; to evaluate the preference for telemedicine to in-person visits; to assess patients' willingness to proceed with major surgery and/or a minor procedure based on a telemedicine visit alone. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: One study showed promising utility of mobile health applications for spine patients. No studies have investigated telemedicine in the evaluation and management of spine patients. METHODS: An 11-part questionnaire was developed to assess the attitudes towards telemedicine for all patients seen within a 7-week period during the COVID-19 crisis. Patients were called by phone to participate in the survey. Chi squared and the Wilcoxon Rank-Sum Test were performed to determine significance. RESULTS: Ninety-five percent were ""satisfied"" or ""very satisfied"" with their telemedicine visit, with 62% stating it was ""the same"" or ""better"" than previous in-person appointments. Patients saved a median of 105 minutes by using telemedicine compared to in-person visits. Fifty-two percent of patients have to take off work for in-person visits, compared to 7% for telemedicine. Thirty-seven percent preferred telemedicine to in-person visits. Patients who preferred telemedicine had significantly longer patient reported in-person visit times (score mean of 171) compared to patients who preferred in-person visits (score mean of 137), pâ=â0.0007. Thirty-seven percent of patients would proceed with surgery and 73% would proceed with a minor procedure based on a telemedicine visit alone. CONCLUSIONS: Telemedicine can increase access to specialty care for patients with prolonged travel time to in-person visits and decrease the socioeconomic burden for both patients and hospital systems. The high satisfaction with telemedicine and willingness to proceed with surgery suggest that remote visits may be useful for both routine management and initial surgical evaluation for spine surgery candidates.

Although this condition is well described in children, disseminated cutaneous leishmaniasis is a rare form of increasing importance and multiple cases observed in the adult population; however, still little described in children. CASE: We present the case of a 12-year-old male, who has multiple ulcerative and nodular lesions distributed throughout the body, of â¼1 year of evolution that did not respond to antimicrobial treatment. After the diagnostic process, positive serological tests were found for leishmaniasis, with improvement in the picture after the use of sodium stibogluconate. DISCUSSION: Disseminated cutaneous leishmaniasis is a clinical form that is described with increasing frequency and should be recognized and treated appropriately, mainly in the pediatric population, avoiding complications and sequelae.","Arteaga-Livias, Kovy; Santos-Huerta, Mijael; Dámaso-Mata, Bernardo; Panduro-Correa, Vicky; Gonzales-Zamora, Jose A; Rodriguez-Morales, Alfonso J",J. trop. pedriatr,,193
264840,"Overriding drug and medical technology patents for pandemic recovery: a legitimate move for high-income countries, too",2021,"BACKGROUND: The association of ACE inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) with disease severity of patients with COVID-19 is still unclear. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to investigate if ACEI/ARB use is associated with the risk of mortality and severe disease in patients with COVID-19. METHODS: We searched all available clinical studies that included patients with confirmed COVID-19 who could be classified into an ACEI/ARB group and a non-ACEI/ARB group up until 4 May 2020. A meta-analysis was performed, and primary outcomes were all-cause mortality and severe disease. RESULTS: ACEI/ARB use did not increase the risk of all-cause mortality both in meta-analysis for 11 studies with 12 601 patients reporting ORs (OR=0.52 (95% CI=0.37 to 0.72), moderate certainty of evidence) and in 2 studies with 8577 patients presenting HRs. For 12 848 patients in 13 studies, ACEI/ARB use was not related to an increased risk of severe disease in COVID-19 (OR=0.68 (95% CI=0.44 to 1.07); I2=95%, low certainty of evidence). CONCLUSIONS: ACEI/ARB therapy was not associated with increased risk of all-cause mortality or severe manifestations in patients with COVID-19. ACEI/ARB therapy can be continued without concern of drug-related worsening in patients with COVID-19.","Lee, Hyun Woo; Yoon, Chang-Hwan; Jang, Eun Jin; Lee, Chang-Hoon",Thorax,,193

While many countries are in a re-opening stage, some effects of the pandemic on people's behaviors are expected to last much longer, including how they choose between different transport options. Experts predict considerably delayed recovery of the public transport options, as people try to avoid crowded places. In turn, significant increases in traffic congestion are expected, since people are likely to prefer using their own vehicles or taxis as opposed to riskier and more crowded options such as the railway. In this paper, we propose to use financial incentives to set the tradeoff between risk of infection and congestion to achieve safe and efficient transportation networks. To this end, we formulate a network optimization problem to optimize taxi fares. For our framework to be useful in various cities and times of the day without much designer effort, we also propose a data-driven approach to learn human preferences about transport options, which is then used in our taxi fare optimization. Our user studies and simulation experiments show our framework is able to minimize congestion and risk of infection.","Beliaev, Mark; Biyik, Erdem; Lazar, Daniel A.; Wang, Woodrow Z.; Sadigh, Dorsa; Pedarsani, Ramtin",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.15749v1.pdf,193

METHODS: Our LUS expert panel consisted of 14 multidisciplinary international experts. Experts voted in 3 rounds on the strength of 26 recommendations as ""strong,"" ""weak,"" or ""do not recommend."" For recommendations that reached consensus for do not recommend, a fourth round was conducted to determine the strength of those recommendations, with 2 additional recommendations considered. RESULTS: Of the 26 recommendations, experts reached consensus on 6 in the first round, 13 in the second, and 7 in the third. Four recommendations were removed because of redundancy. In the fourth round, experts considered 4 recommendations that reached consensus for do not recommend and 2 additional scenarios; consensus was reached for 4 of these. Our final recommendations consist of 24 consensus statements; for 2 of these, the strength of the recommendations did not reach consensus. CONCLUSIONS: In symptomatic medical inpatients with known or suspected COVID-19, we recommend the use of LUS to: (1) support the diagnosis of pneumonitis but not diagnose COVID-19, (2) rule out concerning ultrasound features, (3) monitor patients with a change in the clinical status, and (4) avoid unnecessary additional imaging for patients whose pretest probability of an alternative or superimposed diagnosis is low.

278934,"Data on attitudes, religious perspectives, and practices towards COVID-19 among Indonesian residents: a quick online cross-sectional survey",2020,"More than 2 million people have died as a result of the COVID-19 outbreak. Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is a counter-regulatory enzyme that converts angiotensin-2 to Ang-(1-7) form in the renin-angiotensin system. Several studies have been analyzed the correlation between ACE2 and COVID-19. Indeed, ACE2/Ang (1-7) system protects the lung against acute respiratory distress syndrome by its anti-inflammatory/anti-oxidant function. However, SARS-Cov-2 can use ACE2 for host cell entry. Expression of ACE2 can be altered by several factors, including hypertension, diabetes and obesity, which also could increase the severity of COVID-19 infection. Besides, since androgens increase the expression of ACE-2, males are at higher risks of COVID-19 infection. Although reported statistics showed a significantly different infection risks of COVID-19 between adults and children, the reason behind the different responses is still unclear. This review proposes the effect of ACE polymorphism on the severity of SARS-COV-2 induced pneumonia. The previous meta-analysis regarding the effect of ACE polymorphism on the severity of pneumonia showed that polymorphism only affects the adult's illness severity and not the children. Two recent meta-analyses examined the effect of ACE polymorphism on the prevalence and mortality rate of COVID-19 and reported contradicting results. Our opinion paper suggests that the effect of ACE polymorphism on the severity of COVID-19 depends on the patients age, same as of the pneumonia.","Mohaghegh, Sadra; Motie, Parisa; Motamedian, Saeed Reza",Clin. chem. lab. med,,193

282795,COVID-19 and the ethics of quarantine: a lesson from the Eyam plague,2020,"BACKGROUND: COVID-19 has plagued the globe, with multiple SARS-CoV-2 clusters hinting at its evolving epidemiology. Since the disease course is governed by important epidemiological parameters, including containment delays (time between symptom onset and mandatory isolation) and serial intervals (time between symptom onsets of infector-infectee pairs), understanding their temporal changes helps to guide interventions. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to characterize the epidemiology of the first two epidemic waves of COVID-19 in Hong Kong by doing the following: (1) estimating the containment delays, serial intervals, effective reproductive number (Rt), and proportion of asymptomatic cases; (2) identifying factors associated with the temporal changes of the containment delays and serial intervals; and (3) depicting COVID-19 transmission by age assortativity and types of social settings. METHODS: We retrieved the official case series and the Apple mobility data of Hong Kong from January-August 2020. The empirical containment delays and serial intervals were fitted to theoretical distributions, and factors associated with their temporal changes were quantified in terms of percentage contribution (the percentage change in the predicted outcome from multivariable regression models relative to a predefined comparator). Rt was estimated with the best fitted distribution for serial intervals. RESULTS: The two epidemic waves were characterized by imported cases and clusters of local cases, respectively. Rt peaked at 2.39 (wave 1) and 3.04 (wave 2). The proportion of asymptomatic cases decreased from 34.9% (0-9 years) to 12.9% (&#8805;80 years). Log-normal distribution best fitted the 1574 containment delays (mean 5.18 [SD 3.04] days) and the 558 serial intervals (17 negative; mean 4.74 [SD 4.24] days). Containment delays decreased with involvement in a cluster (percentage contribution: 10.08%-20.73%) and case detection in the public health care sector (percentage contribution: 27.56%, 95% CI 22.52%-32.33%). Serial intervals decreased over time (6.70 days in wave 1 versus 4.35 days in wave 2) and with tertiary transmission or beyond (percentage contribution: -50.75% to -17.31%), but were lengthened by mobility (percentage contribution: 0.83%). Transmission within the same age band was high (18.1%). Households (69.9%) and social settings (20.3%) were where transmission commonly occurred. CONCLUSIONS: First, the factors associated with reduced containment delays suggested government-enacted interventions were useful for achieving outbreak control and should be further encouraged. Second, the shorter serial intervals associated with the composite mobility index calls for empirical surveys to disentangle the role of different contact dimensions in disease transmission. Third, the presymptomatic transmission and asymptomatic cases underscore the importance of remaining vigilant about COVID-19. Fourth, the time-varying epidemiological parameters suggest the need to incorporate their temporal variations when depicting the epidemic trajectory.

288918,COVID-19's Toll on Health Care Workers,2020,"Existing compartmental mathematical modelling methods for epidemics, such as SEIR models, cannot accurately represent effects of contact tracing. This makes them inappropriate for evaluating testing and contact tracing strategies to contain an outbreak. An alternative used in practice is the application of agent- or individual-based models (ABM). However ABMs are complex, less well-understood and much more computationally expensive. This paper presents a new method for accurately including the effects of Testing, contact-Tracing and Isolation (TTI) strategies in standard compartmental models. We derive our method using a careful probabilistic argument to show how contact tracing at the individual level is reflected in aggregate on the population level. We show that the resultant SEIR-TTI model accurately approximates the behaviour of a mechanistic agent-based model at far less computational cost. The computational efficiency is such that it can be easily and cheaply used for exploratory modelling to quantify the required levels of testing and tracing, alone and with other interventions, to assist adaptive planning for managing disease outbreaks.","Sturniolo, Simone; Waites, William; Colbourn, Tim; Manheim, David; Panovska-Griffiths, Jasmina",PLoS Comput Biol,,193

289054,The potential role of nutrition in mitigating the psychological impact of COVID-19 in healthcare workers,2020,"Here, we focus on the data analysis of the growth of epidemic spread of Covid-19 in countries where different policies of containment were activated. It is known that the growth of pandemic spread at its threshold is exponential, but it is not known how to quantify the success of different containment policies. We identify that a successful approach gives an arrested phase regime following the Ostwald growth, where, over the course of time, one phase transforms into another metastable phase with a similar free energy as observed in oxygen interstitial diffusion in quantum complex matter and in crystallization of proteins. We introduce the s factor which provides a quantitative measure of the efficiency and speed of the adopted containment policy, which is very helpful not only to monitor the Covid-19 pandemic spread but also for other countries to choose the best containment policy. The results show that a policy based on joint confinement, targeted tests, and tracking positive cases is the most rapid pandemic containment policy; in fact, we found values of 9, 5, and 31 for the success s factor for China, South Korea, and Italy, respectively, where the lowest s factor indicates the best containment policy.","Bianconi, Antonio; Marcelli, Augusto; Campi, Gaetano; Perali, Andrea",Condens.

Such credentials, which include certificates and certifications as well as boot camps, diplomas, and apprenticeships, often may be obtained in less time and at less expense than associate or baccalaureate degrees. Also, most are closely focused on employable skills. And if students pursue such credentials through systems that enable rational and coherent educational trajectories, they may find it possible to combine them in an aggregate qualification or to stack them toward requirements for an associate or baccalaureate degree. The competitive advantages that a balanced education can offer can be achieved (and may be achieved more fully) through a trajectory that includes ""small bites."" But that is unlikely without considerable planning on the part of both students and institutions. Learning occurs most readily in the context of other learning.","Gaston, Paul L.",Change,,193

We generated SARS-CoV-2 RBD-Fc fusion protein and evaluated its potency to elicit neutralizing antibody response in mice. RBD-Fc elicited a higher neutralizing antibodies titer than RBD as evaluated by a pseudovirus neutralization assay and a live virus based microneutralization assay. Furthermore, RBD-Fc immunized sera better inhibited cell-cell fusion, as evaluated by a quantitative cell-cell fusion assay. The cell-cell fusion assay results correlated well with the virus neutralization potency and could be used for high-throughput screening of large panels of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies and vaccines without the requirement of live virus infection in BSL3 containment. Moreover, the anti-RBD sera did not enhance the pseudotyped SARS-CoV-2 infection of K562 cells. These results demonstrate that Fc fusion can significantly improve the humoral immune response to recombinant RBD immunogen, and suggest that RBD-Fc could serve as a useful component of effective vaccines against SARS-CoV-2.","Liu, Xianglei; Drelich, Aleksandra; Li, Wei; Chen, Chuan; Sun, Zehua; Shi, Megan; Adams, Cynthia; Mellors, John W; Tseng, Chien-Te; Dimitrov, Dimiter S",Vaccine,,193

We ran a survey of parents who had at least one child aged 3 to 17 years old living in the United Kingdom. We received 384 valid responses, which were analysed via a variance-based structural equation modeling approach to test our hypotheses. The results revealed that COVID-19 perceptions effects were Janus-faced. While they indirectly and negatively impact healthy eating behavior mediated by triggering negative experiences during the pandemic, COVID-19 perceptions, however, directly get parents, especially fathers, more engaged into healthy eating behavior - making COVID-19 perceptions total effects positive on healthy eating behavior. This explorative model is novel in the sense that it is the first of its kind to cast light on how parental healthy eating behavior can be shaped in pandemic time. The research is particularly timely due to the uncertain times in which the research is situated, that is, the worldwide pandemic (also termed COVID-19); the paper highlights how family eating practices can undergo dramatic shifts during acute crises.","Mahmoud, Ali B; Hack-Polay, Dieu; Fuxman, Leonora; Nicoletti, Maria",Scand. j. psychol,,193

It has also affected the face-to-face education of 2020 fall semester. In Turkey, Students who have recently entered the university in 2020 started their undergraduate education with distance education like upper grade students. However, the fact that the first graders fell into the distance education system before experiencing university life and without knowing their teachers and friends created different emotional mood. The aim of this study is to analyze the emotional mood of students who have just get into university and have to start their undergraduate education with distance education. Exploratory sequential mixed method is used as a method of this study. Phenomenology method is used the first stage of the method and the survey method is used as the second stage of the method. A total of 18 fresh students (12 female and 6 male) in the departments of Faculty of Education and Faculty of Sport Sciences of Mus Alparslan University were the sample group of the qualitative stage. And 141 students (87 female and 54 male) were the sample of the quantitative stage. As a result of the qualitative analysis, the emotional moods of the students were grouped under four sub-themes: emotion of shock, unfamiliarity with the system, emotion of curiosity and anxiety for the future. First-year students stated that they experienced feelings of shock such as sadness and anxiety when they learned that they would start university with distance education instead of face-to-face education. The students stated that they wondered about the method of teaching the lessons, whether the lessons would be efficient, how the exams would take place, that they were unfamiliar with the system, and that they were worried about the future due to all these uncertainties. According to the analyzes obtained from the survey, it is understood from the answers that the 141 participant students experienced emotional states similar to the results obtained in qualitative findings at a rate of 90% and above. Only the rate of students experiencing an emotion of shock was 64.5% and the rate of experiencing future anxiety was 85.8%. As a result, it was understood from the analyses that qualitative and quantitative results were parallel to each other.","Güner, Halim",Higher Education Studies,,193

In this manuscript we have described a few nuances of the technique still not properly described in the literature: the presence of three colors clusters; the correlation of the viral load with the color change; and the importance of using an internal control to avoid false-negative results. METHODS: To achieve these findings, we performed colorimetric RT-LAMP assays of 466 SARS-CoV-2 RT-qPCR validated clinical samples, with color quantification measured at 434 nm and 560 nm. RESULTS: First we determinate a sensitivity of 93.8% and specificity of 90.4%. In addition to the pink (negative) and yellow (positive) produced colors, we report for the first time the presence of an orange color cluster that may lead to wrong diagnosis. We also demonstrated using RT-qPCR and RT-LAMP that low viral loads are related to Ct values > 30, resulting in orange colors. We also demonstrated that the diagnosis of COVID-19 by colorimetric RT-LAMP is efficient until the fifth symptoms day when the viral load is still relatively high. CONCLUSION: This study reports properties and indications for colorimetric RT-LAMP as point-of-care for SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic, reducing false results, interpretations and optimizing molecular diagnostics tests application.","de Oliveira Coelho, Bruna; Sanchuki, Heloisa Bruna Soligo; Zanette, Dalila Luciola; Nardin, Jeanine Marie; Morales, Hugo Manuel Paz; Fornazari, Bruna; Aoki, Mateus Nóbrega; Blanes, Lucas",Mol Med,,193

Method: An online survey of speech therapists in Hong Kong was conducted between February and March in 2020. The survey comprised up to 15 questions to assess participants' demographics, existing service delivery in telepractice, perception, and their training and knowledge on telepractice. Results: One hundred thirty-five speech (n = 135) speech language pathologists responded to the survey. About one-third (34.8%; n = 47) of participants reported having provided services through telepractice, whereas 72.3% of them started in <3 months and half of them considered it was less effective than face-to-face service. Among the other participants (n = 88), 83% of them indicated that unsuitable patient type and age as the main reason for not providing telepractice. The majority of participants had no prior training for delivering telepractice, and focused on technology when asked about their desired training. Knowledge of participants on telepractice was found only to align fairly with international guidelines. Discussions: The survey findings suggested that telepractice provision in Hong Kong was different from that of other countries where telepractice has been well established, due to the accelerated emergence by the COVID-19 pandemic. Conclusions: The study showed how the development of telepractice would be like in a short time frame, and findings on perception and desired training could be a reference for a better establishment of this model of service.","Fong, Raymond; Tsai, Chun Fung; Yiu, Oi Yan",Telemed. j. e. health,,193

Some challenges and dilemmas currently faced during the pandemic include the management of cancer patients during the treatment and follow-up phases, the assessment of the safety of treatments currently used for the management of SARS-CoV-2 for use in cancer patients, the development of psychoeducation and emotional support for cancer patients and the safe conduct of clinical trials involving participation of cancer patients. Evidence from the literature supports the need for the urgent development of a holistic contingency plan which will include clear guidelines for the protection and comprehensive care of cancer patients. The implementation of such a plan is expected to have many beneficial effects by mainly minimizing the increased morbidity and mortality of cancer patients that could result as an adverse consequence of the COVID-19 or future pandemics.","Constantinou, Constantina; Kolokotroni, Ourania; Mosquera, Maria-Cecilia; Heraclides, Alexandros; Demetriou, Christiana; Karayiannis, Peter; Quattrocchi, Annalisa; Charalambous, Andreas",Cancer med,,193

PURPOSE: (1) Develop disaster-preparedness protocols specific to the COVID-19 pandemic for an urban OBOT program, and (2) evaluate the impacts of the protocol and telehealth on care. METHODS: Disaster-preparedness protocols specific to the COVID-19 pandemic were developed for an urban OBOT program, implemented on March 16, 2020. Retrospective chart review compared patients from January 1, 2020 to March 13, 2020, to patients from March 16, 2020 to April 30, 2020, abstracting patient demographics and comparing show and no-show rates between studied groups. RESULTS: The disaster-preparedness protocol was developed under a deliberative process to address social issues of the urban underserved population. Of 852 visits conducted between Jan 1, 2020, and April 30, 2020, a 91.7% show rate (n = 166/181) was documented for telemedicine visits after protocol implementation compared with a 74.1% show rate (n = 497/671) for routine in-person care (P = .06) without significant differences between the study populations. The no-show rate was significantly lower after protocol implementation (8.3% vs 25.9%; P <0.05). CONCLUSIONS: OBOTs require organized workflows to continue to provide services during the COVID-19 pandemic. Telemedicine, in the face of relaxed federal regulations, has the opportunity to enhance addiction care, creating a more convenient as well as an equally effective mechanism for OBOTs to deliver care that should inform future policy.","O039,; Gurek, David T",J Am Board Fam Med,,193

308917,Protecting Health Care Workers from Infectious Diseases using Physical Proximity Networks (PPN),2020,"Background The evolution of pulmonary 18F-FDG uptake is unknown in patients with pneumonia due to SARSCoV-2 (COVID-19 pneumonia) and in those with persistent respiratory symptoms post-COVID-19 termed Post-COVID-19 Lung-Disease (PCLD). The aim of this study was to assess the temporal evolution of pulmonary 18FFDG uptake and identify a potential role for the use of 18F-FDG-PET/CT imaging in the management of these patients. Methods Clinical data and CT imaging of all patients that underwent 18F-FDG-PET/CT imaging at UCLH, London over the 3-month peak of the UK pandemic were reviewed to identify SARS-CoV-2 infection. Patients were divided in to acute (early and late) COVID-19 pneumonia and PCLD. 18F-FDG uptake in the lungs was measured as a target-to-background ratio (SUVmax/SUVmin) TBRlung which was compared to temporal-stage and plasma CRP. Results There were 20 patients in total (median 61.5y, range 18-84y, 12-male): 11 incidental acute COVID-19 pneumonia cases identified retrospectively (5 Early, 6 Late), and 9 cases performed for PCLD. TBRlung was correlated with time since disease onset (rs=0.83, p=0.002). In the PCLD patients TBRlung correlated with CRP (rs=0.985, p&lt;0.001) and was lower if steroid treatment had been administered (p=0.050). Conclusion Pulmonary 18F-FDG-uptake in COVID-19 pneumonia increases with time after infection. In patients with PCLD the pulmonary 18F-FDG-uptake rises further in the absence of infection, and correlates with CRP levels in serum, suggesting a role for inflammation. The lower pulmonary 18F-FDG-uptake in patients who had received steroid treatment for PCLD, may indicate a role for 18F-FDG-PET/CT in managing these millions of patients.

309172,People with Suspected COVID-19 Symptoms Were More Likely Depressed and Had Lower Health-Related Quality of Life: The Potential Benefit of Health Literacy,2020,"Cryopreservation is required to preserve the native properties of tissue for prolonged periods of time. In this study, we evaluate the impact that 4 different cryopreservation protocols have on porcine urethral tissue, to identify a protocol that best preserves the native properties of the tissue. The cryopreservation protocols include storage in cryoprotective agents at -20 °C and -80 °C with a slow, gradual, and fast reduction in temperature. To evaluate the effects of cryopreservation, the tissue is mechanically characterised in uniaxial tension and the mechanical properties, failure mechanics, and tissue dimensions are compared fresh and following cryopreservation. The mechanical response of the tissue is altered following cryopreservation, yet the elastic modulus from the high stress, linear region of the Cauchy stress - stretch curves is unaffected by the freezing process. To further investigate the change in mechanical response following cryopreservation, the stretch at different tensile stress values was evaluated, which revealed that storage at -20 °C is the only protocol that does not significantly alter the mechanical properties of the tissue compared to the fresh samples. Conversely, the ultimate tensile strength and the stretch at failure were relatively unaffected by the freezing process, regardless of the cryopreservation protocol. However, there were alterations to the tissue dimensions following cryopreservation that were significantly different from the fresh samples for the tissue stored at -80 °C. Therefore, any study intent on preserving the mechanical, failure, and geometric properties of urethral tissue during cryopreservation should do so by freezing samples at -20 °C, as storage at -80 °C is shown here to significantly alter the tissue properties.","Cunnane, Connor V; Croghan, Stephanie M; Walsh, Michael T; Cunnane, Eoghan M; Davis, Niall F; Flood, Hugh D; Mulvihill, John J E",J Mech Behav Biomed Mater,,193

The lack of specific treatment and gold-standard diagnostic system has made the situation more complicated. Efforts have led to production of several diagnostic kits that are associated with limitations such as inadequate sensitivity and accuracy. Aptamers as multipotent biological probes could be promising candidates to design sensitive and specific biosensors. Although few studies have introduced specific aptamer types of coronavirus, they may help us select the best approach to obtain specific aptamers for this virus. On the other hand, some of already-introduced aptamers have shown the inhibitory effects on coronavirus that could be applied as therapeutics.

311848,Mitigating the psychological effects of COVID-19 on health care workers,2020,"Human C5a (hC5a), one of the pro-inflammatory glycoproteins of the complement system is known to undergo production hyperdrive in response to stress and infection. hC5a has been associated with the pathogenesis of many chronic and acute diseases, due to its proven ability in triggering the 'cytokine storm', by binding to its cognate receptor C5aR, expressed in myriad of tissues. Given the pleiotropic downstream function of hC5a, it is logical to consider the hC5a or its precursors as potential drug targets, and thus, we have been rationally pursuing the idea of neutralizing the harmful effect of excessive hC5a, by implementing the repurposing strategies for FDA-approved drugs. Indeed, the proof of principle biophysical studies published recently is encouraging, which strongly supports the potential of this strategy. Considering BSA-carprofen as a reference model system, the current study further explores the inherent conformational plasticity of hC5a and its effect in accommodating more than one drug molecule cooperatively at multiple sites. The data generated by recruiting a battery of experimental and computational biology techniques strongly suggest that hC5a can sequentially accommodate more than one raloxifene molecule with an estimated Ki â¼ 0.5 µM and Ki â¼ 3.58 µM on its surface at non-analogous sites. The study hints at exploration of polypharmacology approach, as a new avenue for discovering synergistic drug molecule pairs, or drug molecules with 'broad-range' binding affinity for targeting the different 'hot spots' on hC5a, as an alternative combination therapy for possible management of the 'cytokine storm'-related inflammatory diseases, like COVID19.

316935,Determinants of the number of deaths from COVID-19: differences between low-income and high-income countries in the initial stages of the pandemic,2021,"BACKGROUND: COVID-19 continues to represent the single biggest challenge to contemporary community sport globally. Compliance with social distancing policies, strict return-to-play protocols, and COVID-19 specific training has, perhaps, forever changed the way that children and young people engage in organised sport. Within this context, and while many children and families seek to re-engage with community sport, we (researchers and sport practitioners) have an obligation to ask questions about how the pandemic has impacted youth sport, understand the short- and long-term consequences, and explore what (if any) opportunities can be seized to assist and improve future participation and retention. The aim of this paper was to present an in-depth exploration of the impact of COVID-19 on youth sport in South Australia. METHODS: Within an interpretive descriptive methodology, this qualitative investigation draws on rich, individual interview and focus group data with 39 youth (ages 15-18), parents, coaches, and sport administrators. A reflexive thematic analysis was undertaken, leading to the development of four substantive themes. RESULTS: We conceptualised the '4 Rs' to advance theoretical understandings about the pandemic's impact on youth sport, including the themes 'recognising struggle', 'reconnection', 're-engaging after restrictions, and 'reimagining sport'. The themes captured insights about a decline in mental wellbeing and physical activity, an increase in family connectedness, the challenge for sports to attract volunteers and participants back into sport, and the opportunities to reset values and philosophies underpinning the provision of youth sport. CONCLUSION: The findings provide valuable insight into the youth sport setting as a result of the global pandemic and suggest that families, sporting clubs and sporting organisations require additional resources and tools (for example, support for parents to facilitate their children's training at home during lockdown) to aid recovery efforts and to ensure the survival and prosperity of youth sport into the future.","Elliott, Sam; Drummond, M J; Prichard, I; Eime, R; Drummond, C; Mason, R",BMC Public Health,,193

Since then, its use has expanded to a number of rheumatological and inflammatory conditions. In dermatology, off-label use of tocilizumab has been reported to be efficacious in morphoea, systemic sclerosis, psoriasis, atopic dermatitis, vitiligo, graft-versus-host disease, pyoderma gangrenosum, Behcet's disease, Schnitzler's syndrome, sarcoidosis, and cutaneous adverse reactions. That being said, the evidence demonstrating tocilizumab's efficacy in dermatology is predominantly low-level case-based evidence, and one must consider the potential for publication bias. In this review we will discuss the reported clinical applications of tocilizumab in dermatology, mechanisms of action, and the range of associated adverse effects (both cutaneous and non-cutaneous) that can occur. Additionally, we will discuss the role of tocilizumab in the management of COVID-19.","Choong, Dean Jeremy; Tan, Ernest",Dermatol Ther,,193

Methods: The National Emergency Medical Team of our hospital assumed command of Wuchang Fang Cang Hospital and treated confirmed COVID-19 patients with mild symptoms. Relocatable CT was used to examine patients in this hospital. Automatic positioning technology was applied to avoid close contact between medical staff and patients and to protect medical staff more effectively. Results: Seven hundred lung CT scans acquired from 269 patients were completed from February 17 to 26, 2020 with automatic positioning technology for relocatable CT in a Fang Cang hospital. All scans were conducted successfully using automatic positioning technology. All patients entered the scanning room from a separate door. All the position lines were accurate, and all images met the requirement for diagnosis of COVID-19, with satisfied quality. None of our medical staff had any close contact with patients. Conclusion: Automatic positioning technology applied to relocatable CT can minimize the close contact between technologists and patients and effectively improve the protection of medical staff without sacrificing image quality.","Jiang, S.; Jiang, Z.; Luo, L.

METHOD: Articles published in electronic databases-PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and CINHAL with the compliant keywords-were scouted from December 2019 to November 2020. All original articles, letters to editors, reviews, and consensus statements were reviewed and included. RESULTS: In all, 20 articles that had information pertaining to self-care of persons with laryngectomy or guidelines for clinicians working with this population were identified. Four of the included studies were case reports of persons with laryngectomy who contracted the COVID-19 virus. One of the included articles was a cohort study that explored the use of telerehabilitation in persons with laryngectomy. CONCLUSION: The hallmarks of preventative strategies for persons with laryngectomy during the COVID-19 pandemic are as follows: physical distancing, use of a three-ply mask or surgical mask to cover the mouth and nose, and use of Heat Moisture Exchange (HME) device over stoma in addition to covering it with a surgical mask or laryngectomy bib. Telerehabilitation, not a preference with this population prior to the pandemic, has gained popularity and acceptance during the COVID-19 situation. The reports of COVID-positive persons with laryngectomy have indicated contrary findings from the tracheal and nasal swabs, necessitating compulsory inclusion of both nasal and tracheal swabs.","Varghese, Janet Jaison; Aithal, Venkataraja U; Rajashekhar, Bellur",Support. care cancer,,193

CA1 and CB6 demonstrated potent SARS-CoV-2-specific neutralization activity in vitro. In addition, CB6 inhibited infection with SARS-CoV-2 in rhesus monkeys in both prophylactic and treatment settings. We also performed structural studies, which revealed that CB6 recognizes an epitope that overlaps with angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2)-binding sites in the SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain, and thereby interferes with virus-receptor interactions by both steric hindrance and direct competition for interface residues.

Also, the country's critical care beds are &#8804;63% occupied. This achievement results from the excellent coordination and action by the Argentine Ministry of Health together with the 23 provinces and the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires of the nation for now. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Regarding cardiovascular care for patients over 65 years of age, a more accurate analysis could be performed when two comparative half-yearly periods corresponding to the years 2019 and 2020 (pandemic time) were compared. The data collected regarding this age range revealed issues that had not previously been evaluated in our country. That undoubtedly proposes a different solution for the future based on a strict scientific analysis. RESULTS: The ratio of patients who received stents to those that underwent coronary surgery was 6 to 1, while the ratio of patients who had off-pump surgery to those that underwent minimally invasive surgery was 69 to 1. CONCLUSION: An Argentinian perspective regarding cardiovascular care is good because the country has an excellent level of qualified medical training in its cardiac surgery and interventional cardiology services, as well as healthcare infrastructure distributed throughout the country, which will undoubtedly be able to respond to the new challenges posed by the post-pandemic period.","Benetti, Federico; Del Prete, Sergio H; Glanc, Mario; Navia, Daniel",J. card. surg,,193

Patients' management and outcomes, especially in severe and critical cases, can vary depending on regional standard operating procedures and local guidance. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: Rapid review methodology was applied to include all the studies published on PubMed and Embase between December 15th 2019 and February 28th 2021, reporting in-hospital and respiratory support-related mortality in adult patients hospitalized with COVID-19 that underwent either continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), non-invasive ventilation (NIV) or invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV). Only English language studies with &#8805;100 patients and reporting data on respiratory failure were included. Data on comorbidities, ventilatory parameters and hospital-related complications were registered. EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: Fifty-two studies (287359 patients - 57.5% males, mean age 64 years (range 24-98)) from 17 different countries were included in the final analysis. 33.3% of patients were hospitalized in intensive care units. 44.2% had hypertension, 26.1% had diabetes, and 7.1% a chronic respiratory disease. 55% of patients underwent respiratory support (36% IMV, 62% NIV and 2% CPAP). Without considering a study with the highest number of patients treated with NIV (n=96729), prevalence of NIV and CPAP use was 12.5% and 13.5% respectively. Globally, invasive and non-invasive approaches were heterogeneously applied. In-hospital mortality was 33.7%, and IMV-related mortality was 72.6% (range: 4.3%-99%). Specific mortality in patients treated with CPAP or NIV was available for 53% of studies, and was 29% (range: 7.2%-100%). The median length of hospital stay was 13 days (range: 6-63). The most frequent hospital-related complication was acute kidney injury being reported in up to 55.7% of enrolled patients. CONCLUSIONS: Global employment of respiratory supports and related outcomes are very heterogeneous. The most frequent respiratory support in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia is IMV, while NIV and CPAP are less frequently and equally applied, the latter especially in Europe, while data on NIV/CPAP-related mortality is often under-reported. Integrated and comprehensive reporting is desirable and needed to construct evidence-based recommendations.","Radovanovic, Dejan; Santus, Pierachille; Coppola, Silvia; Saad, Marina; Pini, Stefano; Giuliani, Fabio; Mondoni, Michele; Chiumello, Davide A",Minerva anestesiol,,193

It is a disease that does not spare any age group. The scientific community has been inundated with information since January 2020. This review aims to summarise pertinent information relating to COVID-19 in children. METHOD: Literature search was conducted in 2020 on the PubMed, MEDLINE, and Embase databases, with the keywords ""COVID 19"" and ""children"". A bibliographic search of articles included was also undertaken. The abstracts were scanned to assess their appropriateness to be included in this narrative review. The data was updated on 11th April 2020. RESULT: The aetiology, transmission, incubation, pathophysiology, clinical features and complications, and management are discussed in this study. CONCLUSION: Our understanding of COVID-19 is evolving as more reports are being published. The growth of SARS-CoV2 is limited in children and they are often asymptomatic. The disease course is also milder. Continued research to understand its effect in children is important to help us manage the disease in these vulnerable populations in a timely fashion.","Ha, Jennifer F",Current pediatric reviews (Online),,193

What are the gendered implications of the increased pressures on consular diplomacy? Turning to longer-term issues, how do gender justice organisations that respond to COVID-19 target diplomats and embassies? How, in turn, do diplomats respond to such advocacy and the underlying problems they address, and does the recent increase in women diplomats make any difference?

The purpose of this special report is to document the impact of COVID-19 on the food service industry, as well as provide strategies based on empirical evidence and suggestions for future preparedness. Studies have found a need for increased emphasis on specific arenas within the food service industry: 1) cleaning and sanitation of fomites such as doorknobs, menus, and table surfaces, 2) rigorous hand-washing and mask-wearing practices to decrease transmissibility of the virus, 3) effective ventilation within operations, and 4) empathetic leadership to enhance resiliency as food service operations across the country cope and work toward reopening. From the practitioner's standpoint, clear and effective communication is key for working with food service operations. The importance of social distancing and mask wearing has been documented using science-based evidence;however, the ways in which these measures are enforced in food service establishments vary across counties and cities within each state, leading to confusion and frustration. As we prepare for the next pandemic, having a rigorous plan to deal with different biological hazards across multiple organizational levels will help with preparedness and the speed of implementation.","Sirsat, Sujata A.",Journal of Environmental Health,,193

One of the major benefits which favours this examination, is that this is a non-invasive, low-cost and radiation-free imaging modality which allows repeated imaging. LUS plays an important role in a wide range of pathologies, including cardiogenic oedema, acute respiratory distress syndrome and fibrosis. Specific LUS findings have proved useful and predictive of acute respiratory distress syndrome which is of particular relevance in the suspicion and monitoring of patients with lung disease. Furthermore, several studies have confirmed the role of LUS in the screening of interstitial lung diseases in connective tissue diseases. Given these data, LUS will likely play an important role in the management of COVID-19 patients from identification of specific abnormalities corresponding to definite pneumonia phases and CT scans findings. In addition, LUS could allow reduction in the exposure of health-care workers to potential infection. Herein, we provide a summary on emerging role of lung ultrasound in COVID-19 pneumonia.","Lepri, Gemma; Orlandi, Martina; Lazzeri, Chiara; Bruni, Cosimo; Hughes, Michael; Bonizzoli, Manuela; Wang, Yukai; Peris, Adriano; Matucci-Cerinic, Marco",Eur J Rheumatol,,193

336606,A cross-sectional survey of activities to support mental wellness during the COVID-19 pandemic,2021,"The Betacoronaviruses comprise multiple subgenera whose members have been implicated in human disease. As with SARS, MERS and now SARS-CoV-2, the origin and emergence of new variants are often attributed to events of recombination that alter host tropism or disease severity. In most cases, recombination has been detected by searches for excessively similar genomic regions in divergent strains; however, such analyses are complicated by the high mutation rates of RNA viruses, which can produce sequence similarities in distant strains by convergent mutations. By applying a genome-wide approach that examines the source of individual polymorphisms and that can be tested against null models in which recombination is absent and homoplasies can arise only by convergent mutations, we examine the extent and limits of recombination in Betacoronaviruses. We find that recombination accounts for nearly 40% of the polymorphisms circulating in populations and that gene exchange occurs almost exclusively among strains belonging to the same subgenus. Although experimental studies have shown that recombinational exchanges occur at random along the coronaviral genome, in nature, they are vastly overrepresented in regions controlling viral interaction with host cells.","Bobay, Louis-Marie; O039,; Donnell, Angela C; Ochman, Howard",PLoS Genet,,193

This observational study included confirmed COVID-19 patients. The primary endpoint was the development of moderate-severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Time to moderate-severe ARDS, the need for mechanical or noninvasive ventilation (MV/NIV), death, and a composite of death or MV/NIV were secondary endpoints. Of 138 patients included, 27 (19.6%) were immunosuppressed (IS) and 95 (68.8%) were male, with a median (IQR) age of 68 (54-78) years. A significantly lower proportion of IS patients (25.9%) compared to non-IS patients (52.3%) developed moderate-severe ARDS, in both unadjusted (0.32; 95% CI, 0.13-0.83; p = .017) and adjusted (aOR, 0.25; 95% CI, 0.08-0.80; p = .019) analyses. After stratifying by pathologies, only IS patients with autoimmune diseases remained significant (aOR 0.25; 95% CI, 0.07-0.98; p = .046). Nonsignificant trends toward a longer time to moderate or severe ARDS, a lower need for MV/NIV, and a lower risk of death or MV/NIV were detected among IS. In our cohort of COVID-19 patients, nonsevere immunosuppression was associated with a lower risk of moderate-severe ARDS, especially among AD. This suggests a potential protective effect from a hypothesized hyper-inflammatory response.","Monreal, Enric; Maza S, Sainz de la; Gullón, Pedro; Natera-Villalba, Elena; Chico-García, Juan Luis; Beltrán-Corbellini, Álvaro; Martínez-Sanz, Javier; García-Barragán, Nuria; Buisán, Javier; Toledano, Rafael; Alonso-Canovas, Araceli; Pérez-Torre, Paula; Matute-Lozano, María C; López-Sendón, Jose Luis; García-Ribas, Guillermo; Corral, Íñigo; Fortún, Jesús; Montero-Errasquín, Beatriz; Manzano, Luis; Máiz-Carro, Luis; Costa-Frossard, Lucienne; Masjuan, Jaime",J Med Virol,,193

We also evaluate the radiological imaging methods computed tomography (CT) and chest X-ray (CXR) for visualization of patient lung condition. Moreover, we review possible therapeutics for COVID-19 using four categories: treatments related and unrelated to lung disease and treatments that have and have not entered clinical trials. Although many treatments have started clinical trials, they have some drawbacks, such as short-term and small-group testing, that need to be addressed as soon as possible.","Yim, Joowon; Lim, Hee Hyun; Kwon, Youngjoo",Arch. pharm. res,,193

DESIGN: National survey. SETTING: UK maternity services during the COVID-19 pandemic. POPULATION OR SAMPLE: Healthcare professionals working within maternity services. METHODS: A national electronic survey was developed to investigate local modifications to general and specialist maternity care during the COVID-19 pandemic, in the context of the contemporaneous national pandemic guidance. After a pilot phase, the survey was distributed through professional networks by the RCOG and co-authors. The survey results were presented descriptively in tabular and graphic formats, with proportions compared using chi-square tests. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Service modifications made during the pandemic. RESULTS: A total of 81 respondent sites, 42% of the 194 obstetric units in the UK, were included. They reported substantial and heterogeneous maternity service modifications. Seventy percent of units reported a reduction in antenatal appointments and 56% reported a reduction in postnatal appointments; 89% reported using remote consultation methods. A change to screening pathways for gestational diabetes mellitus was reported by 70%, and 59% had temporarily removed the offer of births at home or in a midwife-led unit. A reduction in emergency antenatal presentations was experienced by 86% of units. CONCLUSIONS: This national survey documents the extensive impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on maternity services in the UK. More research is needed to understand the impact on maternity outcomes and experience. TWEETABLE ABSTRACT: A national survey showed that UK maternity services were modified extensively and heterogeneously in response to COVID-19.","Jardine, J; Relph, S; Magee, L A; von Dadelszen, P; Morris, E; Ross-Davie, M; Draycott, T; Khalil, A",BJOG,,193

We aimed to investigate the barriers to the physical prevention, negative attitudes, and anxiety levels. METHODS: A online cross-sectional survey was conducted with the people living in Wuhan between March 12th and 23rd, 2020. RESULTS: Of a total of 2411 complete responses, the mean and standard deviation for the total physical prevention barriers score was 19.73 (standard deviation ± 5.3; range 12-45) out of a possible score of 48. Using a cut-off score of 44 for the State-Trait Inventory score, 79.9% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 78.2-81.5) of the participants reported moderate to severe anxiety during the early phase of the outbreak, and 51.3% (95% CI 49.2-53.3) reported moderate to severe anxiety after the peak of coronavirus diseases 2019 was over (during the study period). Comparing anxiety levels in the early phase of the outbreak and after the peak of the outbreak, 58.5% (95% CI 56.5-60.5) recorded a decreased anxiety. Females reported a higher likelihood of having decreased levels of anxiety than males (odds ratio = 1.78, 95% CI 1.48-2.14). Low negative attitudes score were associated with a higher decrease in anxiety (odds ratio = 1.59, 95% CI 1.33-1.89). CONCLUSIONS: The attitudinal barriers to prevention of transmission of coronavirus diseases 2019 are more prominent than physical prevention barriers after the peak of coronavirus diseases 2019. High anxiety levels even after the peak warrant serious attention.","Lin, Yulan; Alias, Haridah; Luo, Xiao; Hu, Zhijian; Wong, Li Ping",Psychosomatics,,193

During the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) lockdown period in Germany, less patients presented at emergency departments and private practices. Objective: The aim of this study was to investigate the DKA risk in children and adolescents with DM1 manifestation during the COVID-19 lockdown and associated risk factors. Material and methods: The frequency of DKA at DM1 onset in patients <18 years between 13 March and 13 May 2020 in pediatric diabetes centers was analyzed. The centers also documented their assessment, if the presentation was delayed or the diagnosis was not made on the first medical consultation. In order to analyze the influence of the risk factors on the frequency of DKA, the data from 2020 were compared with the same periods in 2018 and 2019 using multivariable linear and logistic regression. Results: The data of 532 patients from 216 diabetes centers showed that the risk for DKA increased by 84.7% and the risk for severe DKA increased by 45.3% compared to the years 2018/2019. Children <6 years had the highest risk with an 141.6% increase for DKA and 97.0% for severe DKA compared to the previous years. Migration background was a risk factor independent of COVID-19. Of the patients 31% had either a delayed presentation or a missed diagnosis. Conclusion: During the COVID-19 lockdown the frequency of DKA and severe DKA at DM1 onset was significantly increased for children and adolescents in Germany. Age <6 years, migration background and delayed diagnosis were the main risk factors.","Mönkemöller, Kirsten; Kamrath, Clemens; Hammersen, Johanna; Biester, Torben; Warncke, Katharina; Pappa, Angeliki; Fink, Katharina; Raile, Klemens; Rohrer, Tilman R; Holl, Reinhard W",Monatsschr Kinderheilkd,,193

A better understanding of the pervasiveness of facial contact in social settings is required in order to then take steps to mitigate the action. METHODS: YouTube videos of random individuals were included in a behavioral observation study to document rates of contact to the eyes, nose, and mouth area. Factors including age, sex, the presence of eyewear or facial hair, distraction and fatigue were analyzed as possible contributing factors that increase likelihood of facial contact. RESULTS: The median rate of facial contact was 22 contacts per hour. Men had a significantly higher rate of facial contact compared to women. Age, glasses, and presence of facial hair were not contributing factors. The mouth was the most frequently observed site of contact. Fatigue and distraction may increase rates of facial contact. CONCLUSIONS: Changing personal behavior is a simple and cost-effective action that can be employed to reduce one's risk of acquiring an infectious disease. This study indicates that there are societal differences that put some individuals at higher risk of contracting infectious disease than others.","Christensen, Paul A; Anton, Joseph R; Anton, Canivan R; Schwartz, Mary R; Anton, Rose C",Am. j. infect. control,,193

There was a numerical increase of time in therapeutic range from 53.6 ± 21.3% to 57.1 ± 15.7% (p = 0.30). Proportion of patients with international normalized ratio (INR) >5 significantly decreased from 3.9 to 2.0% (p = 0.04). No significant differences were observed in thromboembolic or bleeding complications. Visits to emergency department decreased from (29.5 to 22.7%; p = 0.41). Conclusion: Oral anticoagulation self-monitoring and self-management program seems an appropriate approach that could provide additional benefits in selected patients with mechanical valve prosthesis.","Blanch, Pedro; Freixa-Pamias, Román; Gambau, Marta; Lafuente, Raul; Basile, Luca",J. comp. eff. res.

347740,Pandemic response protocol of a non-frontline specialty in a multispecialty tertiary health care centre-a pilot model in orthopaedics,2020,"BACKGROUND: SARS-CoV-2 infection continues to cause significant morbidity and mortality worldwide. Preliminary data on SARS-CoV-2 infection suggest that some immunocompromised hosts experience worse outcomes. We performed a retrospective matched cohort study to characterize outcomes in HIV-positive patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. METHODS: Leveraging data collected from electronic medical records for all patients hospitalized at NYU Langone Health with COVID-19 between March 2, 2020, and April 23, 2020, we matched 21 HIV-positive patients with 42 non-HIV patients using a greedy nearest-neighbor algorithm. Admission characteristics, laboratory test results, and hospital outcomes were recorded and compared between the 2 groups. RESULTS: Although there was a trend toward increased rates of intensive care unit admission, mechanical ventilation, and mortality in HIV-positive patients, these differences were not statistically significant. Rates for these outcomes in our cohort are similar to those previously published for all patients hospitalized with COVID-19. HIV-positive patients had significantly higher admission and peak C-reactive protein values. Other inflammatory markers did not differ significantly between groups, although HIV-positive patients tended to have higher peak values during their clinical course. Three HIV-positive patients had superimposed bacterial pneumonia with positive sputum cultures, and all 3 patients died during hospitalization. There was no difference in frequency of thrombotic events or myocardial infarction between these groups. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides evidence that HIV coinfection does not significantly impact presentation, hospital course, or outcomes of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2, when compared with matched non-HIV patients. A larger study is required to determine whether the trends we observed apply to all HIV-positive patients.","Karmen-Tuohy, Savannah; Carlucci, Philip M; Zervou, Fainareti N; Zacharioudakis, Ioannis M; Rebick, Gabriel; Klein, Elizabeth; Reich, Jenna; Jones, Simon; Rahimian, Joseph",J Acquir Immune Defic Syndr,,193

The rapid shift to telehealth necessitated by the pandemic has also created a need for socially distanced education and precepting. This article presents teleprecepting as a modality for clinical opportunities and connecting students to previously limited experiences, such as training in small specialties, in rural areas, and with interdisciplinary teams. Precepting NP students using telehealth follows similar principles as in-person teaching, but some modifications and additional considerations are needed to transition to the virtual environment. At a time when many NPs have swiftly adapted to telehealth in practice, this article will offer a brief ""how-to"" for teleprecepting. Prior to COVID-19, teleprecepting was piloted with less than 2% of NP students in the school's pilot teleprecepting project. Seven months after the initial surge of cases and restrictions, 72% of students (n = 151) in the family nurse practitioner, psychiatric mental health nurse practitioner, and pediatric nurse practitioner specialties had transitioned to teleprecepting. This project was implemented rapidly during the pandemic, and thus, evaluations comparing competency outcomes and experiences of students and preceptors are still in process. Additionally, feasibility of this educational model may change as telehealth regulations continue to evolve. COVID-19 poses challenges for both patient care and clinical training of NP students across specialties. With some adaptation, clinical placements can be transitioned to the virtual environment of telehealth. Future studies should examine student competencies based on teleprecepting experiences and preceptor training to support teleprecepting roles.","Johnson, Deborah; Gatewood, Elizabeth; Ling, Amanda; Kuo, Angel Chen",J Am Assoc Nurse Pract (Online),,193
354474,The Effectiveness of a Family-Based Asthma Self-Management Program in Enhancing the Asthma Health Outcomes in School-Age Children,2021,"Background - His bundle pacing (HBP) is the most physiologic pacing modality. However, HBP has longer procedure times with frequent high capture thresholds, which likely contributes to the low adoption of this approach. The aim of this study is to compare HBP implantation with a novel imaging technique versus the standard implantation technique. Methods - This study included 50 patients with standard pacing indications randomized to HBP with visualization of the tricuspid valve annulus (TVA, N=25, the visualization group) or with the standard method (N=25, the control group). In the visualization group, the TVA was imaged by contrast injection in the right ventricle during fluoroscopy. The site for HBP was identified in relationship to the tricuspid septal leaflet and interventricular septum. Results - Permanent HBP was successful in 92% in the visualization group and 88% in the control group. The fluoroscopic time for HBP lead placement was significantly shorter in the visualization group (7.1±3.3min) compared with the control group (10.1±5.6min, P=0.03). Total procedural and fluoroscopic times were also significantly shorter in the visualization group (91.0±15.7min and 9.6±3.8min) than the control group (104.4±17.8min and 12.7±6.2min, P=0.01 and 0.04, respectively). There was no significant difference in capture threshold between groups. In the visualization group, there was a quantitative association between the HBP site and the TVA. Conclusions - The visualization technique shortens the procedural and fluoroscopic times for HBP implantation. Moreover, anatomic localization of HBP sites is strongly associated with physiologic characteristics of pacing, which can help guide optimal lead placement.","Gu, Min; Niu, Hongxia; Hu, Yiran; Liu, Xi; Zhang, Nixiao; Cai, Minsi; Chen, Xuhua; Zhou, Xiaohong; Gold, Michael R; Hua, Wei; Zhang, Shu",Circ.

Trinta e duas amostras de Sarcocystis spp. de gambás do Estado do Rio Grande do Sul, Brasil, tiveram o DNA extraído e amplificado utilizando marcadores moleculares em genes codificadores de antígeno de superfície (SAG-2, SAG-3, e SAG-4). Entre essas amostras, 28 tiveram pelo menos um dos fragmentos gênicos sequenciados. Foi possível sequenciar os 3 fragmentos gênicos de 20 amostras. As análises das sequências dos genes renderam os seguintes resultados: SAG-2: 275 nucleotídeos e sete alelos para 26 amostras; SAG-3: 353 nucleotídeos e seis alelos para 21 amostras; SAG-4: 278 nucleotídeos e onze alelos para 25 amostras. Para cada marcador, análises filogenéticas foram realizadas empregando métodos de distância. As reconstruções filogenéticas permitiram verificar as relações de ancestralidade entre os diferentes alelos, que foram nomeados de acordo com o critério de evolução inferido na topologia das árvores. Para os três loci, diferentes alelos foram agrupados em três grupos ou genótipos, que foram nomeados com caracteres em números romanos I, II, III e IV. Diferenças intra-genótipo (sub-genótipos) foram representados por letras minúsculas (Ia, Ib, Ic, etc.). Cada alelo foi nomeado com numeração arábica (Ia1, Ia2, Ia3, etc.). Nas analises filogenéticas concatenadas baseada em dados de aminoácidos foi possível dividir as amostras dentro de três grupos. A filogenia baseada nas sequências de aminoácidos indica que três grupos de organismos devem existir dentro do complexo de indivíduos da população estudada (Sarcocystis-RS, Falcatula-like e Neurona-like). Embora o grupo designado como Sarcocystis-RS tenha um único alelo para o locus gênico SAG-3 (configuração do tipo III), táxons deste grupo compartilham alelos com indivíduos do grupo Falcatula-like. Assim, seria plausível assumir que exista uma troca gênica entre as duas populações. No que diz respeito ao grupo Neurona-like, nenhum dos indivíduos deste grupo compartilham alelos com indivíduos de outros grupos. No entanto, esta observação precisa ser confirmada, pois as análises foram baseadas em poucas sequências Neurona-like (duas sequências).

This is a new situation for most stroke teams that often leads to uncertainty among physicians, nurses, and technicians who are in immediate contact with patients. The situation is made even more complicated by numerous new regulations and protocols that are released in rapid succession. Herein, we are describing our experience with simulation training for COVID-19 stroke treatment protocols. One week of simulation training allowed us to identify numerous latent safety threats and to adjust our institution-specific protocols to mitigate them. It also helped our physicians and nurses to practice relevant tasks and behavioral patterns (eg, proper donning and doffing PPE, where to dispose potentially contaminated equipment) to minimize their infectious exposure and to adapt to the new situation. We therefore strongly encourage other hospitals to adopt simulation training to prepare their medical teams for code strokes during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Kurz, Martin W; Ospel, Johanna Maria; Daehli Kurz, Kathinka; Goyal, Mayank",Stroke,,193

METHODS: A retrospective cohort study of adult COVID-19 patients admitted to an integrated health care network in the New York metropolitan region between March 1, 2020 and April 27, 2020. The final analysis included 9407 patients with an overall VTE rate of 2.9% (2.4% in the medical ward and 4.9% in the ICU) and a VTE or mortality rate of 26.1%. Most patients received prophylactic-dose thromboprophylaxis. Multivariable analysis showed significantly reduced VTE or mortality with Black race, history of hypertension, angiotensin converting enzyme/angiotensin receptor blockers use, and initial prophylactic anticoagulation. It also showed significantly increased VTE or mortality with age 60 years or greater, Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) of 3 or greater, patients on Medicare, history of heart failure, history of cerebrovascular disease, body mass index greater than 35, steroid use, anti-rheumatologic medication use, hydroxychloroquine use, maximum D-dimer 4 times or greater than the upper limit of normal (ULN), ICU level of care, increasing creatinine, and decreasing platelet counts. CONCLUSION: In our large cohort of hospitalized COVID-19 patients, the overall in-hospital VTE rate was 2.9% (4.9% in the ICU) and a VTE or mortality rate of 26.1%. Key predictors of VTE or mortality included advanced age, increasing CCI, history of cardiovascular disease, ICU level of care, and elevated maximum D-dimer with a cutoff at least 4 times the ULN. Use of prophylactic-dose anticoagulation but not treatment-dose anticoagulation was associated with reduced VTE or mortality.","Cohen, Stuart Lance; Gianos, Eugenia; Barish, Matthew A; Chatterjee, Saurav; Kohn, Nina; Lesser, Martin; Giannis, Dimitrios; Coppa, Kevin; Hirsch, Jamie; McGinn, Thomas; Goldin, Mark; Spyropoulos, Alex",Thromb. haemost,,193
360529,Mandatory vaccination for health care workers: an analysis of law and policy,2021,"While an FDA approved drug Ivermectin was reported to dramatically reduce the cell line of SARS-CoV-2 by â¼5000 folds within 48 h, the precise mechanism of action and the COVID-19 molecular target involved in interaction with this in-vitro effective drug are unknown yet. Among 12 different COVID-19 targets along with Importin-&#945; studied here, the RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) with RNA and Helicase NCB site show the strongest affinity to Ivermectin amounting -10.4 kcal/mol and -9.6 kcal/mol, respectively, followed by Importin-&#945; with -9.0 kcal/mol. Molecular dynamics of corresponding protein-drug complexes reveals that the drug bound state of RdRp with RNA has better structural stability than the Helicase NCB site and Importin-&#945;, with MM/PBSA free energy of -187.3 kJ/mol, almost twice that of Helicase (-94.6 kJ/mol) and even lower than that of Importin-&#945; (-156.7 kJ/mol). The selectivity of Ivermectin to RdRp is triggered by a cooperative interaction of RNA-RdRp by ternary complex formation. Identification of the target and its interaction profile with Ivermectin can lead to more powerful drug designs for COVID-19 and experimental exploration.","Sen Gupta, Parth Sarthi; Biswal, Satyaranjan; Panda, Saroj Kumar; Ray, Abhik Kumar; Rana, Malay Kumar",J Biomol Struct Dyn,,193
363986,Does Pandemic Anxiety Affect Urology Health Care Workers?,2021,"BACKGROUND: Human coronaviruses are causative agents of respiratory infections with several subtypes being prevalent worldwide. They cause respiratory illnesses of varying severity and have been described to be continuously emerging but their prevalence is not well documented in Uganda. This study assessed the seroprevalence of antibodies against the previously known human coronaviruses prior 2019 in Uganda. METHODS: A total 377 serum samples collected from volunteers that showed influenza like illness in five hospital-based sentinel sites and archived were analyzed using a commercial Qualitative Human Coronavirus Antibody IgG ELISA kit. Although there is no single kit available that can detect the presence of all the circulating coronaviruses, this kit uses a nucleoprotein, aa 340-390 to coat the wells and since there is significant homology among the various human coronavirus strains with regards to the coded for proteins, there is significant cross reactivity beyond HCoV HKU-39849 2003. This gives the kit a qualitative ability to detect the presence of human coronavirus antibodies in a sample. RESULTS: The overall seroprevalence for all the sites was 87.53% with no significant difference in the seroprevalence between the Hospital based sentinel sites (p = 0.8). Of the seropositive, the age group 1-5 years had the highest percentage (46.97), followed by 6-10 years (16.67) and then above 20 (16.36). An odds ratio of 1.6 (CI 0.863-2.97, p = 0.136) showed that those volunteers below 5 years of age were more likely to be seropositive compared to those above 5 years. The seropositivity was generally high throughout the year with highest being recorded in March and the lowest in February and December. CONCLUSIONS: The seroprevalence of Human coronaviruses is alarmingly high which calls for need to identify and characterize the circulating coronavirus strains so as to guide policy on the control strategies.","Mulabbi, Elijah Nicholas; Tweyongyere, Robert; Wabwire-Mangen, Fred; Mworozi, Edison; Koehlerb, Jeff; Kibuuka, Hannah; Millard, Monica; Erima, Bernard; Tugume, Titus; Aquino, Ukuli Qouilazoni; Byarugaba, Denis K",BMC Infect Dis,,193
363987,Does Pandemic Anxiety Affect Urology Health Care Workers?,2021,"BACKGROUND: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) targets the respiratory and gastric epithelium, causing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Tissue antigen expression variations influence host susceptibility to many infections. This study aimed to investigate the closely linked Lewis (FUT3) and ABO histo-blood types, including secretor (FUT2) status, to infections with SARS-CoV-2 and the corresponding severity of COVID-19. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Patients (Caucasians, n = 338) were genotyped for ABO, FUT3, and FUT2, and compared to a reference population of blood donors (n = 250,298). The association between blood types and severity of COVID-19 was addressed by dividing patients into four categories: hospitalized individuals in general wards, patients admitted to the intensive care unit with and without intubation, and deceased patients. Comorbidities were considered in subsequent analyses. RESULTS: Patients with blood type Lewis (a-b-) or O were significantly less likely to be hospitalized (odds ratio [OR] 0.669, confidence interval [CI] 0.446-0.971, OR 0.710, CI 0.556-0.900, respectively), while type AB was significantly more prevalent in the patient cohort (OR 1.519, CI 1.014-2.203). The proportions of secretors/nonsecretors, and Lewis a+ or Lewis b+ types were consistent between patients and controls. The analyzed blood groups were not associated with the clinical outcome as defined. DISCUSSION: Blood types Lewis (a-b-) and O were found to be protective factors, whereas the group AB is suggested to be a risk factor for COVID-19. The antigens investigated may not be prognostic for disease severity, but a role for ABO isoagglutinins in SARS-CoV-2 infections is strongly suggested.","Matzhold, Eva Maria; Berghold, Andrea; Bemelmans, Maria Karin Berta; Banfi, Chiara; Stelzl, Evelyn; Kessler, Harald Hans; Steinmetz, Ivo; Krause, Robert; Wurzer, Herbert; Schlenke, Peter; Wagner, Thomas",Transfusion,,193

Although the pandemic has an all-round impact on medical work, the degree of its impact on endovascular thrombectomy (EVT) for patients with acute ischemic stroke (AIS) is unclear. METHODS: We continuously included AIS patients with large artery occlusion who underwent EVT in a comprehensive stroke center before and during the Wuhan shutdown. The protected code stroke (PCS) for screening and treating AIS patients was established during the pandemic. The efficacy and safety outcomes including the rate of successful reperfusion (defined as modified Thrombolysis In Cerebral Infarction (mTICI) graded 2b or 3) and time intervals for reperfusion were compared between two groups: pre-pandemic and pandemic. RESULTS: A total of 55 AIS patients who received EVT were included. The baseline characteristics were comparable between the two groups. The time from hospital arrival to puncture (174 vs 125.5 min; p=0.002) and time from hospital arrival to reperfusion (213 vs 172 min; p=0.047) were significantly prolonged in the pandemic group compared with the pre-pandemic group. The rate of successful reperfusion was not significantly different between the two groups (85.7% (n=18) vs 88.2% (n=30); OR 0.971, 95% CI 0.785 to 1.203; p=1.000). CONCLUSION: The results of this study suggest a proper PCS algorithm which combines the COVID-19 screening and protection measures could decrease the impact of the disease on the clinical outcomes of EVT for AIS patients to the lowest extent possible during the pandemic.","Yang, Bin; Wang, Tao; Chen, Jian; Chen, Yanfei; Wang, Yabing; Gao, Peng; Li, Guilin; Chen, Fei; Li, Long; Wang, Zheng; Zhang, Hongqi; Song, Haiqing; Ma, Qingfeng; Jiao, Liqun",J Neurointerv Surg,,193

RESULTS: 25.5% (117/458) of women were severe and 74.4% (341/458) mild presentation. Three percent (9/341) of mild presentations required a subsequent hospitalization. Overall, 26/458 women (5.6%) were admitted to ICU, and 13/458 (2.8%) required mechanical ventilation. One maternal death occurred at 49-days postpartum. Severe presentation, infection above 24 weeks, and comorbidities were associated with an adverse maternal outcome. Of total deliveries, 16.5% (36/217) were <37 weeks. Perinatal mortality was 6/226 (2.7%), mostly due to the fetal component.

The multi-layered nanocomposite exhibits an effective route for developing polymer film with large energy capability due to the advantage of each layer. Here, two sandwich constructions of boron nitride nanosheets (BNNSs)/poly(vinylidene fluoride-chlorotrifluoroethylene) (P(VDF-CTFE)) nanocomposite film were designed to investigate the effects of architecture regulation on energy storage performance,i.e., the nanocomposite serving as inner layer with pristine films as outer layers, in which the nanocomposite film delivers a strongly polarized behavior and the pristine polymer provides a high breakdown strength. The BNNSs were liquid exfoliated from boron nitride bulk assisted with fluoro hyperbranched copolymer that was adsorbed on the surface of nanosheetsviaCH-&#960; non-covalent interactions. The presence of fluoro segments improves the compatibility between nanosheets and P(VDF-CTFE) matrix. The maximum polarization of 7.9 µC cm-2at 300 MV m-1is achieved in the tailored sandwich film, and the discharged energy density of 9.1 J cm-3is obtained in current nanocomposite, which benefits from the barrier effect between adjacent layers induced by the redistribution of electric field and emerging charge traps at the interfaces. This sandwich BNNSs/P(VDF-CTFE) nanocomposite provides an insight prospect for structural design with respect to the advanced application of polymer film capacitor.","Zhang, Xuanhe; Ye, Huijian; Chen, Hongyun; Xu, Lixin",,,193

We sought to document the prevalence of burnout syndrome amongst intensivists facing the COVID-19 outbreak. METHODS: Cross-sectional survey among intensivists part of the European Society of Intensive Care Medicine. Symptoms of severe burnout, anxiety and depression were collected. Factors independently associated with severe burnout were assessed using Cox model. RESULTS: Response rate was 20% (1001 completed questionnaires were returned, 45 years [39-53], 34% women, from 85 countries, 12 regions, 50% university-affiliated hospitals). The prevalence of symptoms of anxiety and depression or severe burnout was 46.5%, 30.2%, and 51%, respectively, and varied significantly across regions. Rating of the relationship between intensivists and other ICU stakeholders differed significantly according to the presence of anxiety, depression, or burnout. Similar figures were reported for their rating of the ethical climate or the quality of the decision-making. Factors independently associated with anxiety were female gender (HR 1.85 [1.33-2.55]), working in a university-affiliated hospital (HR 0.58 [0.42-0.80]), living in a city of > 1 million inhabitants (HR 1.40 [1.01-1.94]), and clinician's rating of the ethical climate (HR 0.83 [0.77-0.90]). Independent determinants of depression included female gender (HR 1.63 [1.15-2.31]) and clinician's rating of the ethical climate (HR 0.84 [0.78-0.92]). Factors independently associated with symptoms of severe burnout included age (HR 0.98/year [0.97-0.99]) and clinician's rating of the ethical climate (HR 0.76 [0.69-0.82]).

METHODS: We conducted a multicenter, retrospective, observational cohort study among all French expert centers for neuromyelitis optica and related disorders. Patients with NMOSD or MOGAD included in the study received a confirmed or highly suspected diagnosis of COVID-19 between 1 March 2020 and 30 June 2020. Main outcome was COVID-19 severity score assessed on a seven-point ordinal scale ranging from 1 (not hospitalized with no limitations on activities) to 7 (death). RESULTS: Fifteen cases (mean [SD] age: 39.3 [14.3] years, 11 female) were included. Five patients (33.3%) were hospitalized, all receiving rituximab. A 24-year-old patient with positive aquaporine-4 antibody, with obesity as comorbidity, needed mechanical ventilation. Outpatients were receiving anti-CD20 (5), mycophenolate mofetil (3) or azathioprine (3). They were younger (mean [SD] age: 37.0 [13.4] years), with a longer disease duration (mean [SD]: 8.3 [6.3] years) and had a lower expanded disability severity score (EDSS) score (median [range] EDSS: 2.5 [0-4]) relative to patients requiring hospitalization (mean [SD] age: 44.0 [16.4] years, mean [SD] disease duration: 5.8 [5.5] years, median [range] EDSS: 4 [0-6.5]).

Does this fraud mean that CPCs are not beneficial in models of ischemic cardiomyopathy? At least 50 studies from 26 laboratories independent of the Harvard group have reported beneficial effects of CPCs in mice, rats, pigs, and cats. The mechanism of action remains unclear. Our group has shown that CPCs do not engraft in the diseased heart, do not differentiate into new cardiac myocytes, do not regenerate dead myocardium, and thus work via paracrine mechanisms. A casualty of the misconduct at Harvard has been the SCIPIO trial, a collaboration between the Harvard group and the group in Louisville. The retraction of the SCIPIO paper was caused exclusively by issues with data generated at Harvard, not those generated in Louisville. In the retraction notice, the Lancet editors stated: ""Although we do not have any reservations about the clinical work in Louisville that used the preparations from Anversa's laboratory in good faith, the lack of reliability regarding the laboratory work at Harvard means that we are now retracting this paper."" We must be careful not to dismiss all work on CPCs because of one laboratory's misconduct.

OBJECTIVE: We assessed the frequency of a fever &#8805;100.4°F and other symptoms associated with COVID-19 among patients in the emergency department (ED) who were tested in the ED for the illness. METHODS: This is a retrospective review of data from patients who were tested for acute COVID-19 infection from March 10, 2020 through June 30, 2020 at two EDs within the same health care system. Data collected included temperature, the presence or recent history of COVID-19-related symptoms, and COVID-19 test results. Descriptive statistics are reported for presenting fever and other COVID-19-related symptoms alone and in combination with presenting fever. RESULTS: A total of 6894 patients were tested for COVID-19. Among these, 330 (4.8%) tested positive for active infection. Of these patients, 64 (19.4%) presented with a fever &#8805;100.4°F (&#8805;38.0°C). Increasing the number of COVID-19-related symptoms in combination with a presenting fever &#8805;100.4°F increased the number of people who could be identified as having a COVID-19 infection. CONCLUSIONS: About a quarter of patients who were tested positive for COVID-19 in our ED did not have a fever at presentation &#8805;100.4°F. Using only temperature to screen for COVID-19 in the community setting will likely miss the majority of patients with active disease.","Vilke, Gary M; Brennan, Jesse J; Cronin, Alexandrea O; Castillo, Edward M",J. emerg. med,,193

Proinflammatory cytokine and chemokine production induced by SARS-CoV-2 were observed not only in symptomatic patients but also in asymptomatic cases, and returned to normal after recovery. IL-6, IL-7, IL-10, IL-18, G-CSF, M-CSF, MCP-1, MCP-3, IP-10, MIG, and MIP-1&#945; were found to be associated with the severity of COVID-19. Moreover, a set of cytokine and chemokine profiles were signicfiantly higher in SARS-CoV-2-infected male patients than female cases. The serum levels of MCP-1, G-CSF, and VEGF were weekly and positively correlated with the viral titers.

This study focused on describing air quality during the initial phase of the Novel Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic (since there were fewer anthropogenic activities) in 10 Chinese mega-cities. Using the independent t-test, the means of air quality index (AQI) scores and individual air pollutants concentration during the outbreak were compared with the means before the outbreak. Cohen's d was estimated to quantify how much difference was observed. Based on the AQI score, the air quality in these 10 cities ranged from excellent (Shenzhen) to light pollution (Xi'an) with 44.8 µg m-3 and 119.7 µg m-3, respectively. In comparison to the 2019 air quality, Guangzhou and Wuhan noted major differences in air quality during the outbreak. Indicators of traffic pollution, particularly NO2, were significantly lower during the outbreak in all cities. Particulate matter pollution varied, with some cities observing lower concentrations and other higher concentrations during the outbreak. There was a significant decrease in air pollution levels during the outbreak. More researchers should observe changes in air quality during peculiar or major events. Implementation of stringent regulation on vehicle use should be considered in mega-cities. Relevant findings should be employed in emphasizing the detrimental effects of anthropogenic activities and support the need for stringent emission control regulations.","Ethan, Crystal Jane; Mokoena, Kingsley Katleho; Yu, Yan",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,193
386955,Correction: COVID-19 Discourse on Twitter in Four Asian Countries: Case Study of Risk Communication,2021,"Much has been written about WHO. Relatively little is known, however, about the organisation's evolving relationship with health-related personal beliefs, 'faith-based organisations' (FBOs), religious leaders and religious communities ('religious actors'). This article presents findings from a 4-year research project on the 'spiritual dimension' of health and WHO conducted at the University of Zürich. Drawing on archival research in Geneva and interviews with current and former WHO staff, consultants and programme partners, we identify three stages in this relationship. Although since its founding individuals within WHO occasionally engaged with religious actors, it was not until the 1970s, when the primary healthcare strategy was developed in consultation with the Christian Medical Commission, that their concerns began to influence WHO policies. By the early 1990s, the failure to roll out primary healthcare globally was accompanied by a loss of interest in religion within WHO. With the spread of HIV/AIDS however, health-related religious beliefs were increasingly recognised in the development of a major quality of life instrument by the Division of Mental Health, and the work of a WHO expert committee on cancer pain relief and the subsequent establishment of palliative care. While the 1990s saw a cooling off of activities, in the years since, the HIV/AIDS, Ebola and COVID-19 crises have periodically brought religious actors to the attention of the organisation. This study focusses on what we suggest may be understood as a trend towards a closer association between the activities of WHO and religious actors, which has occurred in fits and starts and is marked by attempts at institutional translation and periods of forgetting and remembering.","Winiger, Fabian; Peng-Keller, Simon",,,193

As of late August 2020, over 25 million persons had been infected, and we will see the global death toll exceed one million by the end of 2020. Both are minimum estimates. All segments of society have been drastically affected. Schools worldwide have been forced to close due to illness and absenteeism, transmission and risk to vulnerable members of the school community, and community concerns. The decision to reopen school during a pandemic will have a tremendous impact on children's safety, growth, and well-being. Not opening invites social isolation and suboptimal educational experiences, especially for youth whose computing assets and online access are limited and those with special needs. The opening has hazards as well, and the mitigation of these risks is the topic of this chapter. Opening schools requires careful considerations of benefits, risks, and precautions. Guiding principles for safety and strategic application of the principles in each educational niche are critical issues to consider during school reopening. The fundamental principles of disease control involve school-directed initiatives (physical distancing and mask use, hand/face and surface cleansing, administrative controls, engineering controls) and individual-level risk reduction approaches to maximize adherence to new guidelines. The school-initiated ""top-down"" approaches and the individual-level ""bottom-up"" approaches must be synergized, as no single method will ensure safety. We discuss how to effectively layer strategies in each educational space to increase safety. Since the vulnerability of children has been heightened during this pandemic crisis, we highlight the special considerations for mental health support that should be considered by schools. The safety principles, disease control strategies, and other critical issues discussed here will serve as a starting point for developing a safe, comprehensive, and feasible reopening plan.","Li, Dan; Lin, Elizabeth Z; Brault, Marie A; Paquette, Julie; Vermund, Sten H; Godri Pollitt, Krystal J",Adv Exp Med Biol,,193

Our study aims to analyze Hg accumulation in Loligo forbesi caught in the Azores Archipelago (Portugal) quantifying Hg in different tissues (mantle and stomach), as well in the squid stomach content, in order to evaluate the efficiency of Hg transfer from prey to predator. Hg data from the tissues was used to estimate the weekly tolerable Hg intake due to squid consumption. Overall data indicate that Hg measured in the stomach tissue (0.1 ± 0.01 µg g-1) was significantly higher than Hg levels found in the mantle (0.04 ± 0.001 µg g-1) and stomach contents (0.01 ± 0.001 µg g-1). BMF (bioaccumulation factor) was >1 for all the samples, indicating a biomagnification process from prey to predator. Hg concentration in the mantle tissue was correlated with mantle size; although females present higher Hg levels than males, the difference was found to be not related to gender but rather to the fact that females had larger bodies. Finally, considering the Hg concentration found in the mantle and the permitted Hg levels, it is advisable to consume up to 1050-1890g of squid per week, according to the regulatory agencies. Thus, our results indicate that, since these doses are respected, consumption of squids from the Azorean waters do not pose a risk to humans.","Vieira, H C; Rendón-von Osten, J; Soares, A M V M; Morgado, F; Abreu, S N",Ecotoxicol Environ Saf,,193

(Special Collection: COVID-19.),2020,"OBJECTIVE: The rapidly evolving COVID-19 pandemic has created a need for timely data from the healthcare systems for research. To meet this need, several large new data consortia have developed that require frequent updating and sharing of electronic health record (EHR) data in different common data models (CDMs) to create multi-institutional databases for research. Traditionally, each CDM has had a custom pipeline for extract, transform and load operations for production and incremental updates of data feeds to the networks from raw EHR data. However, the demands of COVID-19 research for timely data are far higher, and the requirements for updating faster than previous collaborative research using national data networks. New approaches need to be developed to address these demands. METHODS: In this paper, we describe the use of the Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resource (FHIR) data model as a canonical data model and the automated transformation of clinical data to the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Network (PCORnet) and Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) CDMs for data sharing and research collaboration on COVID-19. RESULTS: FHIR data resources could be transformed to operational PCORnet and OMOP CDMs with minimal production delays through a combination of real-time and post-processing steps, leveraging the FHIR data subscription feature. CONCLUSIONS: The approach leverages evolving standards for the availability of EHR data developed to facilitate data exchange under the 21st Century Cures Act and could greatly enhance the availability of standardized datasets for research.","Lenert, Leslie A; Ilatovskiy, Andrey V; Agnew, James; Rudsill, Patricia; Jacobs, Jeff; Weatherston, Duncan; Deans, Kenneth",J. am. med. inform. assoc,,193

A strikingly high mortality rate of 94% was described in early reports of patients with COVID-19 transitioned to ECMO. Later case reports and series demonstrating successful recovery from COVID-19 after ECMO have revived interest in this therapeutic modality, including the recent approval of ECMO for COVID-19 patients by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Here, we present the first reports of devastating intracranial hemorrhage as a complication of veno-venous (VV) ECMO in two COVID-19 patients. CLINICAL PRESENTATION: We performed a retrospective analysis of 2 cases of devastating intracranial hemorrhage in patients on VV-ECMO for the treatment of COVID-19. Collected data included clinical history, laboratory results, treatment, and review of all available imaging. Both patients demonstrated activated partial thromboplastin times (aPTT) within an appropriate therapeutic range. No risk factors that clearly predicted likelihood of this complication were identified. CONCLUSION: Understanding the complications of ECMO in this cohort and developing therapeutic algorithms to aid in optimal patient selection will be critical in the limited resource setting experienced as a result of global pandemic. We propose the use of head computed tomography (CT) to identify devastating neurological complications as early as possible, aiding in the resource allocation of ECMO machines to the most appropriately selected patients.","Heman-Ackah, Sabrina M; Su, YouRong Sophie; Spadola, Michael; Petrov, Dmitriy; Chen, H Isaac; Schuster, James; Lucas, Timothy",Neurosurgery,,193

For our experimental environment, we constructed a large room that has specific lighting systems on the ceiling. For providing a general look-and-feel of living room condition, we also prepared the room with neutral-colored wallpaper and placed the display in the room. Subjects and Experimenters can tap on buttons on the smart-phones or tablets for adjusting the illumination conditions and picture options of the display. Under various illumination conditions, subjects are asked to choose the best preferred picture mode set while watching ten kinds of test images. All these series of our experiments are conducted under no-contact experimental environment thanks to the wireless applications loaded onto the smart-phone, tablet and display. These applications: (i) collect the data;(ii) automatically build a dataset;(iii) analyze the data by using machine learning techniques. By employing our system, large datasets that contain participants' preferences for the given display under various illumination conditions are collected safely and easily without risking COVID-19 spread. As a result, after finishing our experiment, most participants, specifically color scientists, praised our zero-contact experimental solution which can be used for other perceptual experimental processes by providing an easy way to build and analyze databases. © 2021 IEEE.","Park, J.

OBJECTIVES: We conducted a systematic review to examine the interorganizational care coordination initiatives that Veterans Affairs (VA) and community partners have pursued in caring for rural Veterans, including challenges and opportunities, organizational domains shaping care coordination, and among these, initiatives that improve or impede health care outcomes. RESEARCH DESIGN: We followed Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines to search 2 electronic databases (PubMed and Embase) for peer-reviewed articles published between January 2009 and May 2020. Building on prior research, we conducted a systematic review. RESULTS: Sixteen articles met our criteria. Each captured a unique health care focus while examining common challenges. Four organizational domains emerged: policy and administration, culture, mechanisms, and relational practices. Exemplars highlight how initiatives improve or impede rural health care delivery. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first systematic review, to our knowledge, examining interorganizational care coordination of rural Veterans by VA and Community Care programs. Results provide exemplars of interorganizational care coordination domains and program effectiveness. It suggests that partners' efforts to align their coordination domains can improve health care, with rurality serving as a critical contextual factor. Findings are important for policies, practices, and research of VA and Community Care partners committed to improving access and health care for rural Veterans.","Garvin, Lynn A; Pugatch, Marianne; Gurewich, Deborah; Pendergast, Jacquelyn N; Miller, Christopher J",Med Care,,193

Identifying (often multiple) sources of infection in immunocompromised patients is crucial but deciding whether multiple organisms, which in health are considered as commensals, are actually pathogenic during vulnerable states-can be clinically difficult. Our case highlights the efforts to correctly identify the actual source of this rare organism and the recognition of its pathogenic potential when other illnesses present. We also review the literature of Corynebacteria in patients with haematological malignancies but believe this is the first case of AML to be infected with Corynebacterium presenting during the COVID-19 pandemic with a probable incidental positive swab for SARS-CoV-2.","Bakhsh, Abdul Rahim Ali; Lewis, Keir Edward",BMJ case reports,,193

404155,Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the urologist's clinical practice in Brazil: a management guideline proposal for low- and middle-income countries during the crisis period,2020,"Ureterosciatic hernia is extremely rare. In ureteral herniation, ureter prolapses occur through either the greater or lesser sciatic foramen. Atrophy of the piriformis muscle, hip joint diseases, and defects in the parietal pelvic fascia are predisposing factors for the development of ureterosciatic hernia. Most symptomatic patients have been treated surgically, with conservative treatment reserved only for asymptomatic patients. To the best of our knowledge, long-term follow-up outcomes after ureterosciatic hernia management are sparse. In this paper, we report the case of a 68-year-old woman who presented with colicky left abdominal pain. After computed tomography (CT) scan and anterograde pyelography, she was diagnosed ureterosciatic hernia with obstructive uropathy. We performed ureteral balloon dilatation and double-J ureteral stent placement. After this minimally invasive procedure, CT scan demonstrated that the left ureter had returned to its normal anatomical position without looping into the sciatic foramen. The patient remained asymptomatic with no adverse events 7 years after the minimally invasive procedures. This brief report describes ureterosciatic hernia successfully managed with minimally invasive procedures with long-term follow-up outcomes.","Kim, Yeong Uk; Cho, Jae Ho; Song, Phil Hyun",,,193

METHODS: A total of 30 adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were assigned to 5 groups with complete random experiment design: Sham group (Sham), MCT group, TXL group, sildenafil (SIL) group and combination group (TXL+SIL), 6 rats in each group. Rats were injected with 50 mg/kg MCT solution for inducing PAH model except for those in the sham group. From the day of modeling, rats of TXL, SIL and TXL+SIL groups were given TXL (1.2 g/kg), SIL (10 mg/kg) and combination solution (TXL:1.2 g/kg, SIL: 10 mg/kg) respectively, and rats in Sham and MCT groups were given normal saline (5 mL/kg). The samples were collected and tested after 21 consecutive days of intragastric administration. Echocardiography was used to measure the related indices of RVF, including pulmonary arterial flow spectrum, pulmonary artery diameter (PAD), right ventricular wall thickness (RVWT), right ventricular diameter (RVD), tricuspidannular plane systolic excursion (TAPSE), right atrium transverse diameter (RAT), and inferior vena cava diameter (IVCD). Elastic Verhoeff-Van Gieson staining was adopted to measure the percentage of wall thickness (WT%) of pulmonary arteriols. Hematoxylin-eosin staining was used to measure the cross-sectional area (CSA) of right ventricular cardiomyocytes. RESULTS: MCT-induced PAH rat model was successfully established. In MCT group the wall of pulmonary arterioles exhibited a prominent-increase thickness, PAD, RVWT, RVD, RAT, IVCD, WT%, right ventricular hypertrophy index (RVHI) as well as CSA of RV cardiomyocyte significantly increased (all P<0.01), and TAPSE markedly decreased (P<0.01). At the same time, TXL prominently improved all of the above indices (all P<0.01). In comparison with SIL, TXL significantly reduced RVD (P<0.05) and decreased CAS of RV cardiomyocytes (P<0.01), but TAPSE in SIL group was much larger than in TXL group (P<0.01). Moreover, TAPSE in TXL+SIL group was larger than that in TXL group (P<0.01), while the two groups performed equally well in terms of the other indices. CONCLUSION: Early intervention of TXL could inhibit pulmonary arterioles remodeling, and improve RVF by attenuating right ventricular hypertrophy, and TXL has a stronger effect on inhibiting right ventricular remodeling than SIL.","Gao, Lu; Li, Shao-Dan; Zhang, Yin; Liu, Yi; Yang, Ming-Hui",Chinese Journal of Integrative Medicine,,193

409522,Mental health status of individuals with a mood-disorder during the COVID-19 pandemic in Australia: Initial results from the COLLATE project,2020,"BackgroundThe period from February to June 2021 was one during which initial wild-type SARS-CoV-2 strains were supplanted in Ontario, Canada, first by variants of concern (VOC) with the N501Y mutation (Alpha/B1.1.17, Beta/B.1.351 and Gamma/P.1 variants), and then by the Delta/B.1.617 variant. The increased transmissibility of these VOCs has been documented but data for increased virulence is limited. We used Ontarios COVID-19 case data to evaluate the virulence of these VOCs compared to non-VOC SARS-CoV-2 infections, as measured by risk of hospitalization, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, and death. MethodsWe created a retrospective cohort of people in Ontario testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 and screened for VOCs, with dates of test report between February 7 and June 27, 2021 (n=212,332). We constructed mixed effects logistic regression models with hospitalization, ICU admission, and death as outcome variables. Models were adjusted for age, sex, time, vaccination status, comorbidities, and pregnancy status. Health units were included as random intercepts. ResultsCompared to non-VOC SARS-CoV-2 strains, the adjusted elevation in risk associated with N501Y-positive variants was 52% (43-62%) for hospitalization; 89% (67-116%) for ICU admission; and 51% (30-74%) for death. Increases with Delta variant were more pronounced: 108% (80-138%) for hospitalization; 234% (164-331%) for ICU admission; and 132% (47-230%) for death. InterpretationThe progressive increase in transmissibility and virulence of SARS-CoV-2 VOCs will result in a significantly larger, and more deadly, pandemic than would have occurred in the absence of VOC emergence.","Fisman, David; Tuite, Ashleigh",,,193

MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study was conducted in Gazi University hospital. All hospitalized patients with confirmed and suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection between 16 March 2020, and 30 April 2020, were analyzed retrospectively. COVID-19 patients were separated into two groups as pneumonia and non-pneumonia and compared to determine predicting factors for COVID-19 pneumonia. Variables with a p-value of less than 0.20 and not correlated with each other were included in the logistic regression model. RESULTS: Of the 247 patients included in the study, the median age was 40, 58% was female. COVID-19 was confirmed in 70.9% of these patients. 21.4% of COVID-19 confirmed cases had pneumonia. In the multivariate analysis male sex (p = 0.028), hypertension (p = 0.022) and shortness of breath on hospital admission (p = 0.025) were significant factors predicting COVID-19 pneumonia Conclusion: Shortness of breath, male gender, and hypertension were significant for predicting COVID-19 pneumonia on admission.

410255,Children may be less affected than adults by novel coronavirus (COVID-19),2020,"OBJECTIVES: We aimed to examine the association between the transition to social isolation and cognitive decline in older adults during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. DESIGN: Longitudinal study. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: The study included participants from a community in a semiurban area of Japan. We conducted a mailed questionnaire survey of 2000 noninstitutionalized older adults who were randomly sampled. Of those who completed both the baseline and follow-up surveys in March and October 2020, respectively, participants aged &#8805;70 years without cognitive impairment at baseline were included in the analysis. METHODS: Participants were classified into 4 groups based on their baseline and follow-up social isolation status, which were as follows: ""remained nonisolated,"" ""isolated from nonisolation,"" ""nonisolated from isolation,"" and ""consistent isolation."" Self-reported cognitive function was assessed using the Cognitive Performance Scale, and level 2 (mild impairment) or higher (moderate to severe impairment) was defined as cognitive impairment. RESULTS: Ultimately, 955 older adults were analyzed. The mean age of the participants was 79.6 years (standard deviation = 4.7) and 54.7% were women. During the follow-up period, 54 (5.7%) participants developed cognitive impairment. Multivariable logistic regression analysis revealed that compared with the group that remained nonisolated, the isolated from nonisolation and consistent isolation groups were significantly associated with the onset of cognitive impairment [isolated from nonisolation: odds ratio (OR) = 2.74, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.13-6.61, P = .026; consistent isolation: OR = 2.33, 95% CI = 1.07-5.05, P = .033]. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: Social isolation during the COVID-19 pandemic was associated with a decline in cognitive function among older adults. Attention to the social isolation process during the pandemic may be necessary to protect older adults' cognitive health.","Noguchi, Taiji; Kubo, Yuta; Hayashi, Takahiro; Tomiyama, Naoki; Ochi, Akira; Hayashi, Hiroyuki",J Am Med Dir Assoc,,193
410256,Children may be less affected than adults by novel coronavirus (COVID-19),2020,"BACKGROUND: Tuberculosis (TB) in migrants is of concern to health authorities worldwide and is even more critical in Brazil, considering the country´s size and long land borders. The aim of the study was to identify critical areas in Brazil for migrants diagnosed with TB and to describe the temporal trend in this phenomenon in recent years. METHODS: This is an ecological study that used spatial analysis and time series analysis. As the study population, all cases of migrants diagnosed with TB from 2014 to 2019 were included, and Brazilian municipalities were considered as the unit of ecological analysis. The Getis-Ord Gi* technique was applied to identify critical areas, and based on the identified clusters, seasonal-trend decomposition based on loess (STL) and Prais-Winsten autoregression were used, respectively, to trace and classify temporal trend in the analyzed series. In addition, several municipal socioeconomic indicators were selected to verify the association between the identified clusters and social vulnerability. RESULTS: 2,471 TB cases were reported in migrants. Gi* analysis showed that areas with spatial association with TB in immigrants coincide with critical areas for TB in the general population (coast of the Southeast and North regions). Four TB clusters were identified in immigrants in the states of Amazonas, Roraima, São Paulo, and Rio de Janeiro, with an upward trend in most of these clusters. The temporal trend in TB in immigrants was classified as increasing in Brazil (+ 60.66% per year [95% CI: 27.21-91.85]) and in the clusters in the states of Amazonas, Roraima, and Rio de Janeiro (+1.01, +2.15, and + 2.90% per year, respectively). The cluster in the state of São Paulo was the only one classified as stationary. The descriptive data on the municipalities belonging to the clusters showed evidence of the association between TB incidence and conditions of social vulnerability. CONCLUSIONS: The study revealed the critical situation of TB among migrants in the country. Based on the findings, health authorities might focus on actions in regions identified, stablishing an intensive monitoring and following up, ensuring that these cases concluded their treatment and avoiding that they could spread the disease to the other regions or scenarios. The population of migrants are very dynamic, therefore strategies for following up them across Brazil are really urgent to manage the tuberculosis among international migrants in an efficient and proper way.","Arcêncio, Ricardo Alexandre; Berra, Thaís Zamboni; Terena, Nahari de Faria Marcos; Rocha, Matheus Piumbini; Ferraz de Araújo Alecrim, Tatiana; de Souza Kihara, Fernanda Miye; Mascarello, Keila Cristina; Martins Sales, Carolina Maia; Maciel, Ethel Leonor Noia",PLoS One,,193

Seeking leverage points for organizational learning,2021,"BACKGROUND: In many facilities, the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic caused suspension of elective surgery. We therefore sought to determine the impact of this on the surgical experience of vascular trainees. METHODS: Surgical case volume, breadth, and the participating trainee post-graduate level from 3 large New York City Hospitals with integrated residency and fellowship programs (Mount Sinai, Montefiore Medical Center/Albert Einstein College of Medicine, and New York University) were reviewed. Procedures performed between February 26 to March 25, 2020 (pre-pandemic month) and March 26 to April 25, 2020 (peak pandemic period) were compared to those performed during the same time period in 2019. The trainees from these programs were also sent surveys to evaluate their subjective experience during this time. RESULTS: The total number of cases during the month leading into the peak pandemic period was 635 cases in 2019 and 560 cases in 2020 (12% decrease). During the peak pandemic period, case volume decreased from 445 in 2019 to 114 in 2020 (74% reduction). The highest volume procedures during the peak pandemic month in 2020 were amputations and peripheral cases for acute limb ischemia; during the 2019 period, the most common cases were therapeutic endovascular procedures. There was a decrease in case volume for vascular senior residents of 77% and vascular junior and midlevel residents of 75%. There was a 77% survey response rate with 50% of respondents in the senior years of training. Overall, 20% of respondents expressed concern about completing ACGME requirements due to the COVID-19 pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: Vascular surgery-specific clinical educational and operative experiences during redeployment efforts have been limited. Further efforts should be directed to quantify the impact on training and to evaluate the efficacy of training supplements such as teleconferences and simulation.","Ilonzo, Nicole; Koleilat, Issam; Prakash, Vivek; Charitable, John; Garg, Karan; Han, Daniel; Faries, Peter; Phair, John",Vasc Endovascular Surg,,193

In many countries, businesses were shut down, universities and schools had to cancel in-person classes, and many workers had to work remotely and socially distance in order to prevent the spread of the virus. These measures opened the door for technologies such as robotics and artificial intelligence to play an important role in minimizing the negative effects of such closures. There have been many efforts in the design and development of robotic systems for applications such as disinfection and eldercare. Healthcare education has seen a lot of potential in simulation robots, which offer valuable opportunities for remote learning during the pandemic. However, there are ethical considerations that need to be deliberated in the design and development of such systems. In this paper, we discuss the principles of roboethics and how these can be applied in the new era of COVID-19. We focus on identifying the most relevant ethical principles and apply them to a case study in dentistry education. DenTeach was developed as a portable device that uses sensors and computer simulation to make dental education more efficient. DenTeach makes remote instruction possible by allowing students to learn and practice dental procedures from home. We evaluate DenTeach on the principles of data, common good, and safety, and highlight the importance of roboethics in Canada. The principles identified in this paper can inform researchers and educational institutions considering implementing robots in their curriculum.","Maddahi, Y.; Kalvandi, M.; Langman, S.; Capicotto, N.; Zareinia, K.",Frontiers in Robotics &amp; AI,,193

OBJECTIVES: The aim was to evaluate serum HCY concentrations and its prognostic role in dogs with immunosuppressant-responsive enteropathy compared to healthy dogs. METHODS: Serum HCY concentration was statistically compared between 24 healthy dogs and 29 dogs with immunosuppressant-responsive enteropathy. Correlation analyses between serum total protein, albumin (ALB), C-reactive protein (CRP), folate and cobalamin, and serum HCY concentration were performed in immunosuppressant-responsive enteropathic dogs. RESULTS: The associations between serum HCY concentration and clinical, histological, endoscopic scores and follow-up were evaluated. Mean serum HCY concentration was higher in immunosuppressant-responsive enteropathic dogs compared to control dogs (30.22 ± 8.67 µmol/L vs. 5.26 ± 2.78 µmol/L; p < 0.0001). No association between serum HCY concentration and total protein, ALB, CRP, folate concentration as well as, clinical score, histological and endoscopic scores was found. A negative correlation between serum HCY concentration and cobalamin was noted (p = 0.0025, r = -0.54). No significant difference in HCY was found between responsive and non-responsive dogs or between survivors and non-survivors. CONCLUSIONS: Although, serum HCY concentration was higher in immunosuppressant-responsive enteropathy, its prognostic value remains unclear. However, further prospective, large-scale studies are warranted to better investigate the possible prognostic role of HCY in immunosuppressant-responsive enteropathic dogs.","Benvenuti, Elena; Pierini, Alessio; Gori, Eleonora; Bottero, Enrico; Pietra, Marco; Lippi, Ilaria; Meucci, Valentina; Marchetti, Veronica",J Vet Sci,,193

Ten percent had a delayed-onset trajectory (OCS-/OCS+), and the recovery trajectory group (OCS+/OCS-) was the smallest group (6%). Higher education reduced the odds of an OCS+/OCS- trajectory. OCS in 2014 was associated with increased odds of showing an OCS+/OCS+ or OCS-/OCS+ trajectory. When EA at t1 and change in EA from t1 to t2 were added to the model, higher EA at t1 was associated with increased odds of scoring above the cut score on one or more of the assessments. A higher decrease in EA from t1 to t2 reduced the probability of showing an OCS+/OCS+ and an OCS-/OCS+ trajectory.

419697,Covid-19: MPs reject calls to routinely test health and care workers,2020,"Early diagnosis and appropriate treatment of primary aldosteronism, the most frequent cause of secondary hypertension, are crucial to prevent deleterious cardiovascular outcomes. In the past decade, the discovery of genetic abnormalities responsible for sporadic and familial forms of primary aldosteronism has improved the knowledge of the pathogenesis of this disorder. Mutations in genes encoding ion channels and pumps lead to increased cytosolic concentrations of calcium in zona glomerulosa cells, which triggers CYP11B2 expression and autonomous aldosterone production. Improved understanding of the mechanisms underlying the disease is key to improving diagnostics and to developing and implementing targeted treatments. This Review provides an update on the genetic abnormalities associated with sporadic and familial forms of primary aldosteronism, their frequency among different populations and the mechanisms explaining excessive aldosterone production and adrenal nodule development. The possible effects and uses of these findings for improving the diagnostics for primary aldosteronism are discussed. Furthermore, current treatment options of primary aldosteronism are reviewed, with particular attention to the latest studies on blood pressure and cardiovascular outcomes following medical or surgical treatment.

Eighty six human nasal and 495 (50 pools) porcine snout swabs were collected in Schleswig-Holstein, Germany. Staphylococcus (S.) aureus (62.8%, 54/86), human rhino- and coronaviruses (HRV, 29.1%, 25/86; HCoV, 16.3%, 14/86) were frequently detected in humans, while Haemophilus parasuis (90.0%, 45/50), Mycoplasma hyorhinis (78.6%, 11/14), Enterovirus G (EV-G, 56.0%, 28/50) and S. aureus (36.0%, 18/50), respectively, were highly prevalent in pigs. The detection of S. aureus in human follow-up samples indicates a carrier status. The methicillin-resistant phenotype (MRSA) was identified in 33.3% (18/54) of nasal swabs and in one of 18 (5.6%) pooled snout swabs that were tested positive for S. aureus. Strains were indicative of the livestock-associated clonal complex CC398, with t011 being the most common staphylococcal protein A type. Enterobacterales and non-fermenters were frequently isolated from swabs. Their detection in follow-up samples suggests a carrier status. All were classified as being non-multiresistant.

422973,"Dental Professional's Knowledge, Preventive Awareness and Attitude Towards COVID-19 in Saudi Arabia: A Cross-Sectional Survey",2021,"BACKGROUND: Along with its high infectivity and fatality rates, the 2019 Corona Virus Disease (COVID-19) has caused universal psychosocial impact by causing mass hysteria, economic burden and financial losses. Mass fear of COVID-19, termed as ""coronaphobia"", has generated a plethora of psychiatric manifestations across the different strata of the society. So, this review has been undertaken to define psychosocial impact of COVID-19. METHODS: Pubmed and GoogleScholar are searched with the following key terms- ""COVID-19"", ""SARS-CoV2"", ""Pandemic"", ""Psychology"", ""Psychosocial"", ""Psychitry"", ""marginalized"", ""telemedicine"", ""mental health"", ""quarantine"", ""infodemic"", ""social media"" and"" ""internet"". Few news paper reports related to COVID-19 and psychosocial impacts have also been added as per context. RESULTS: Disease itself multiplied by forced quarantine to combat COVID-19 applied by nationwide lockdowns can produce acute panic, anxiety, obsessive behaviors, hoarding, paranoia, and depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in the long run. These have been fueled by an ""infodemic"" spread via different platforms of social media. Outbursts of racism, stigmatization, and xenophobia against particular communities are also being widely reported. Nevertheless, frontline healthcare workers are at higher-risk of contracting the disease as well as experiencing adverse psychological outcomes in form of burnout, anxiety, fear of transmitting infection, feeling of incompatibility, depression, increased substance-dependence, and PTSD. Community-based mitigation programs to combat COVID-19 will disrupt children's usual lifestyle and may cause florid mental distress. The psychosocial aspects of older people, their caregivers, psychiatric patients and marginalized communities are affected by this pandemic in different ways and need special attention. CONCLUSION: For better dealing with these psychosocial issues of different strata of the society, psychosocial crisis prevention and intervention models should be urgently developed by the government, health care personnel and other stakeholders. Apt application of internet services, technology and social media to curb both pandemic and infodemic needs to be instigated. Psychosocial preparedness by setting up mental organizations specific for future pandemics is certainly necessary.","Dubey, Souvik; Biswas, Payel; Ghosh, Ritwik; Chatterjee, Subhankar; Dubey, Mahua Jana; Chatterjee, Subham; Lahiri, Durjoy; Lavie, Carl J",Diabetes Metab Syndr,,193

425022,Implementation and Usefulness of Telemedicine During the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Scoping Review,2020,"BACKGROUND: The characteristics of the COVID-19 pandemic in Europe have changed since the initial outbreak in 2019 due to the emergence of more contagious mutant strains, notably the B.1.1.7 variant. This has resulted in the rapid implementation of vaccination programs in an effort to control the spread of the disease. AIMS: To model the effect of vaccination on the course of the pandemic in Germany taking into account observational data and the appearance of viral mutant B.1.1.7. MATERIALS AND METHODS: An effect model based on the Batman-SIZ algorithm was developed, taking into account both the parent and the B.1.1.7 mutant strains of the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus and using input parameters obtained from observational data for January - March 2021. RESULTS: Effect-modelling using 3 different vaccination scenarios with different rates of vaccination involving 67 million persons (priority groups 1 - 5) and completed within 134 days compared to 318 days beginning February 24, 2021, showed a reduction in the number of infected persons from ca. 12.5 million to ca. 4.5 million with quantitively similar benefits regarding the occupancy and a critical burden on ICU facilities. CONCLUSION: The effect of vaccination in reducing the daily number of new infections, the total number of infections and the occupancy of intensive-care facilities in hospitals is proportional to the speed with which the target population are vaccinated.","Braun, Peter; Braun, Julian; Woodcock, Barry G",Int J Clin Pharmacol Ther,,193

Such models rely on virus- and disease characteristics of which most are uncertain or even unknown for SARS-CoV-2. This study addresses the validity of various assumptions using an epidemiological simulation model. The contributions of this work are twofold. First, we show that multiple scenarios all lead to realistic numbers of deaths and ICU admissions, two observable and verifiable metrics. Second, we test the sensitivity of estimates for the number of infected and immune individuals, and show that these vary strongly between scenarios. Note that the amount of variation measured in this study is merely a lower bound: epidemiological modeling contains uncertainty on more parameters than the four in this study, and including those as well would lead to an even larger set of possible scenarios. As the level of infection and immunity among the population are particularly important for policy makers, further research on virus and disease progression characteristics is essential. Until that time, epidemiological modeling studies cannot give conclusive results and should come with a careful analysis of several scenarios on virus- and disease characteristics.","Koenen, Melissa; Balvert, Marleen; Brekelmans, Ruud; Fleuren, Hein; Stienen, Valentijn; Wagenaar, Joris",PLoS One,,193

In all efforts, data is crucial. Fundamentally, and in the possible absence of a vaccine for 12 to 18 months, we need universal, well-documented testing for both the presence of the disease as well as confirmed recovery through serological tests for antibodies, and we need to track major socioeconomic indices. But we also need auxiliary data of all kinds, including data related to how populations are talking about the unfolding pandemic through news and stories. To in part help on the social media side, we curate a set of 1000 day-scale time series of 1-grams across 24 languages on Twitter that are most `important' for March 2020 with respect to March 2019. We determine importance through our allotaxonometric instrument, rank-turbulence divergence. We make some basic observations about some of the time series, including a comparison to numbers of confirmed deaths due to COVID-19 over time. We broadly observe across all languages a peak for the language-specific word for `virus' in January followed by a decline through February and a recent surge through March. The world's collective attention dropped away while the virus spread out from China. We host the time series on Gitlab, updating them on a daily basis while relevant. Our main intent is for other researchers to use these time series to enhance whatever analyses that may be of use during the pandemic as well as for retrospective investigations.","Alshaabi, T.; Minot, J.

To alleviate such shortcomings, we propose a simple yet efficient architecture, termed Guidance and Teaching Network (GTNet), to independently distil effective spatial and temporal cues with implicit guidance and explicit teaching at feature- and decision-level, respectively. To be specific, we (a) introduce a temporal modulator to implicitly bridge features from motion into the appearance branch, which is capable of fusing cross-modal features collaboratively, and (b) utilise motion-guided mask to propagate the explicit cues during the feature aggregation. This novel learning strategy achieves satisfactory results via decoupling the complex spatial-temporal cues and mapping informative cues across different modalities. Extensive experiments on three challenging benchmarks show that the proposed method can run at ~28 fps on a single TITAN Xp GPU and perform competitively against 14 cutting-edge baselines.","Jiao, Yingxia; Wang, Xiao; Chou, Yu-Cheng; Yang, Shouyuan; Ji, Ge-Peng; Zhu, Rong; Gao, Ge",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2105.10110v3.pdf,193

Nurses often are being seen as compassionate helpers. The public image of nursing, however, also consists of stereotypes such as nursing being a 'doing' profession and care being a 'female' characteristic. Next to that, nursing is associated with images from the past, such as 'the lady with the lamp'. Therefore, in the public eye at least, the nursing identity seems a simple and straightforward enough construct, but nothing less is true. Looking at what a professional identity consists of, historic and social developments influence a group identity as a construct. In addition, individual, professional and contemporary societal moralities, including stereotypes, play its role. Nurses themselves reinforce stereotypes in order to fit into what is expected, even when they believe professional behaviour encompasses other features. They may do so individually as well as in a group context. But nursing actually seems to be better off when viewed upon as a diverse, autonomous profession. Moral values such as compassion motivate nurses to enter the profession. Research shows that if such values are addressed in daily practice, nursing could perhaps be saved from nurses leaving the profession because of feeling unfulfilled. Another aspect concerns the huge nursing body of knowledge. If seen as the ground on which nursing behaviour is standing, it would contribute to a different image of nursing than simplified stereotypes, which do not acknowledge the complex nature of the profession. This paper challenges the idea that the nursing identity is unchangeable and the notion that 'a nurse will always be a nurse'. By doing so, the paper contributes to a debate on the supposed 'true' nature of the nursing identity and opens a discussion on the need for it to change.","van der Cingel, Margreet; Brouwer, Jasperina",Nurs Philos,,193

448686,Actual Racial/Ethnic Disparities in COVID-19 Mortality for the Non-Hispanic Black Compared to Non-Hispanic White Population in 35 US States and Their Association with Structural Racism,2021,"OBJECTIVE: To further evaluate the relationship between the clinical profiles and limbic and motor brain regions and their connecting pathways in psychogenic nonepileptic seizures (PNES). Neurite Orientation Dispersion and Density Indices (NODDI) multicompartment modeling was used to test the relationships between tissue alterations in patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI) and multiple psychiatric symptoms. METHODS: The sample included participants with prior TBI (TBI; N = 37) but no PNES, and with TBI and PNES (TBI + PNES; N = 34). Participants completed 3T Siemens Prisma MRI high angular resolution imaging diffusion protocol. Statistical maps, including fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity (MD), neurite dispersion [orientation dispersion index (ODI)] and density [intracellular volume fraction (ICVF), and free water (i.e., isotropic) volume fraction (V-ISO)] signal intensity, were generated for each participant. Linear mixed-effects models identified clusters of between-group differences in indices of white matter changes. Pearson's r correlation tests assessed any relationship between signal intensity and psychiatric symptoms. RESULTS: Compared to TBI, TBI + PNES revealed decreases in FA, ICVF, and V-ISO and increases in MD for clusters within cingulum bundle, uncinate fasciculus, fornix/stria terminalis, and corticospinal tract pathways (cluster threshold &#945; = 0.05). Indices of white matter changes for these clusters correlated with depressive, anxiety, PTSD, psychoticism, and somatization symptom severity (FDR threshold &#945; = 0.05). A follow-up within-group analysis revealed that these correlations failed to reach the criteria for significance in the TBI + PNES group alone. INTERPRETATION: The results expand support for the hypothesis that alterations in pathways comprising the specific PNES network correspond to patient profiles. These findings implicate myelin-specific changes as possible contributors to PNES, thus introducing novel potential treatment targets.","Goodman, Adam M; Allendorfer, Jane B; Blum, Andrew S; Bolding, Mark S; Correia, Stephen; Ver Hoef, Lawrence W; Gaston, Tyler E; Grayson, Leslie E; Kraguljac, Nina V; Lahti, Adrienne C; Martin, Amber N; Monroe, William S; Philip, Noah S; Tocco, Krista; Vogel, Valerie; LaFrance, W Curt; Szaflarski, Jerzy P",,,193

Stroke as a presentation has not been strongly associated with COVID-19. The authors aimed to retrospectively review a link between COVID-19 and acute stroke. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted a retrospective case-control study of 41 cases and 82 control subjects matched by age, sex, and risk factors. Cases were patients who underwent stroke alert imaging with confirmed acute stroke on imaging between March 16 and April 5, 2020, at 6 hospitals across New York City. Control subjects were those who underwent stroke alertimaging during the same timeframe without imaging evidence of acute infarction. Data pertaining to diagnosis of COVID-19 infection, patient demographics, and risk factors were collected. A univariate analysis was performed to assess the covariate effect of risk factors and COVID-19 status on stroke imaging with positive findings. RESULTS: The mean age for cases and controls was 65.5 ± 15.3 years and 68.8 ± 13.2 years, respectively. Of patients with acute ischemic stroke, 46.3% had COVID-19 infection compared with 18.3% of controls (P = .001). After adjusting for age, sex, and risk factors, COVID-19 infection had a significant independent association with acute ischemic stroke compared with control subjects (OR, 3.9; 95% CI, 1.7-8.9; P = .001). CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated that COVID-19 infection is significantly associated with imaging confirmation of acute ischemic stroke, and patients with COVID-19 should undergo more aggressive monitoring for stroke.","Belani, P; Schefflein, J; Kihira, S; Rigney, B; Delman, B N; Mahmoudi, K; Mocco, J; Majidi, S; Yeckley, J; Aggarwal, A; Lefton, D; Doshi, A H",AJNR am. j. neuroradiology,,193

The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 and the resulting disease named coronavirus disease 2019 has brought the world to its knees both financially and medically. The American Society of Primatologists has postponed their annual meetings from the end of May 2020 until the end of September 2020, while the International Primatological Society have postponed their biennial congress from August 2020 to August 2021, which has also resulted in their 2022 meetings in Malaysia being pushed back until 2023. Here, I explore the potential dangers of pursuing any primate fieldwork during this pandemic on our study species, their ecosystems, and local peoples. I believe that the risk of bringing this virus into our study ecosystems is too great and that primatologists should cancel all field research until the pandemic ends or a vaccine/reliable treatment is widely available.

Currently, there are more than 49,000 species distributed almost all over the world. This broad distribution suggests that they have efficient strategies to improve their survival; one of them is the production of highly elaborate venoms, which are a heterogeneous mixture of molecules like inorganic salts, peptides, proteins, and enzymes. Considering this, this study aimed to analyze the venom of the spider Avicularia juruensis (Mygalomorphae: Theraphosidae) searching for proteolytic enzymes. Using zymography, electrophoresis, transcriptomics and proteomics approaches we identified one neprilysin able to degrade casein, that we named “Ajur_Neprilysin”. Neprilysins are metalloendopeptidases whose presence has already been described in animal venoms, however, its function has not yet been elucidated. Our results showed for the first time one non-bacterial neprilysin which can cleave casein and suggest that its role in envenomation is to degrade the extracellular matrix, facilitating the access of other toxins to their targets, as well as digestive fluids. Moreover, this discovery contributes to increasing the knowledge about little-studied species, since the Ajur_Neprilysin is the second neprilysin found in the venom from a mygalomorph spider.","Nascimento, Soraia Maria do; Oliveira, Ursula Castro; Nishiyama Junior, Milton Yutaka; Tashima, Alexandre Keiji; Silva Junior, Pedro Ismael da",Toxin Rev.,,193

The 2003 SARS epidemic marked a new chapter in disease modelling in Canada as it triggered a national discussion on the utility and uptake of modelling research in local and pandemic outbreaks. However, integration and application of model-based outcomes in public health requires knowledge translation and contextualization. We reviewed the history and performance of Pan-InfORM (Pandemic Influenza Outbreak Research Modelling), which created a national infrastructure in Canada with a mandate to develop innovative knowledge translation methodologies to inform policy makers through modelling frameworks that bridge the gaps between theory, policy, and practice. This review demonstrates the importance of a collaborative infrastructure as a ""Community of Practice"" to guide public health responses, especially in the context of emerging diseases with substantial uncertainty, such as the COVID-19 pandemic. Dedicated resources to modelling and knowledge translation activities can help create synergistic strategies at the global scale and optimize public health responses to protect at-risk populations and quell socioeconomic and health burden.","Tariq, M.; Haworth-Brockman, M.; Moghadas, S.

456915,"75 General paediatric nursing education at GOSH- new team, a new disease",2020,"Natural Killer (NK) cells are innate immune responders critical for viral clearance and immunomodulation. Despite their vital role in viral infection, the contribution of NK cells in fighting SARS-CoV-2 has not yet been directly investigated. Insights into pathophysiology and therapeutic opportunities can therefore be inferred from studies assessing NK cell phenotype and function during SARS, MERS, and COVID-19. These studies suggest a reduction in circulating NK cell numbers and/or an exhausted phenotype following infection and hint toward the dampening of NK cell responses by coronaviruses. Reduced circulating NK cell levels and exhaustion may be directly responsible for the progression and severity of COVID-19. Conversely, in light of data linking inflammation with coronavirus disease severity, it is necessary to examine NK cell potential in mediating immunopathology. A common feature of coronavirus infections is that significant morbidity and mortality is associated with lung injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome resulting from an exaggerated immune response, of which NK cells are an important component. In this review, we summarize the current understanding of how NK cells respond in both early and late coronavirus infections, and the implication for ongoing COVID-19 clinical trials. Using this immunological lens, we outline recommendations for therapeutic strategies against COVID-19 in clearing the virus while preventing the harm of immunopathological responses.","Market, Marisa; Angka, Leonard; Martel, Andre B; Bastin, Donald; Olanubi, Oladunni; Tennakoon, Gayashan; Boucher, Dominique M; Ng, Juliana; Ardolino, Michele; Auer, Rebecca C",Front Immunol,,193
457449,"Eating habits among primary and secondary school students in the Gaza Strip, Palestine: A cross-sectional study during the COVID-19 pandemic",2021,"BACKGROUND: Complicated mechanisms and variable determinants related to drug resistance pose a major challenge to obtain comprehensive antimicrobial resistance (AMR) profiles of Neisseria gonorrhoeae. Meanwhile, cephalosporin-resistant mosaic penA alleles have been reported worldwide. Therefore, it is urgent to monitor the expansion of cephalosporin-resistant mosaic penA alleles. OBJECTIVES: To develop a comprehensive high-throughput method to efficiently screen AMR determinants. METHODS: We developed a method based on multiplex PCR with MALDI-TOF MS, which can simultaneously screen for 24 mutations associated with multiple antimicrobial agents in 19 gonococcal AMR loci (NG-AMR-MS). The performance of the NG-AMR-MS method was assessed by testing 454 N. gonorrhoeae isolates with known MICs of six antibiotics, eight non-gonococcal Neisseria strains, 214 clinical samples and three plasmids with a confirmed mosaic penA allele. RESULTS: The results show that NG-AMR-MS had a specificity of 100% with a sensitivity as low as 10 copies per reaction (except for PorB A121D/N/G, 100 copies per reaction). For clinical samples with gonococcal load >5 copies/µL, the method can accurately identify 20 AMR mutations. In addition, the method successfully detected specific cephalosporin-resistant strains with the A311V mutation in the penA allele. CONCLUSIONS: Our high-throughput method can provide comprehensive AMR profiles within a multiplex format. Furthermore, the method can be directly applied to screening for AMR among clinical samples, serving as an effective tool for overall monitoring of N. gonorrhoeae AMR and also provides a powerful means to comprehensively improve the level of monitoring.","Li, Yamei; Xiu, Leshan; Liu, Jingwei; Zhang, Chi; Wang, Feng; Yin, Yueping; Peng, Junping",J. antimicrob. chemother,,193

We evaluated this virtual format's effectiveness at teaching, facilitating bilingual discussion, and encouraging cross-cultural exchange of experiences - all aimed at improving orthopedic knowledge in a low-resource country like Haiti. DESIGN: Planned collaboratively between North American and Haitian colleagues, the conference involved 4 bilingual weekly Zoom meetings comprised of 4 to 6 prerecorded presentations and live-translated discussion. Pre- and postmeeting knowledge assessments in French (Haitian language of medical instruction) were administered weekly with results compared via 2-sample t-tests. An online postconference survey evaluated attendee satisfaction with the virtual format. SETTING: Virtual. PARTICIPANTS: Weekly attendance involved approximately 50 Haitian orthopedists and trainees, with 20 to 25 completing pre- and postmeeting assessments. RESULTS: Statistically significant increases between pre/post scores were seen during 3 of 4 sessions. Session-wide significant score increases occurred for residents and attending surgeons with <10 years of experience. 85.7% of attendees reported the virtual platform exceeded expectations and 100% indicated likely or extremely likely participation in further virtual events. CONCLUSIONS: The pilot virtual HAAOT was extremely well received with high desire for future sessions. Beyond short-term knowledge retention among attendees, nonmeasurable benefits included collaboration between orthopedists and trainees in the United States, Canada, United Kingdom, Haiti, and Burkina Faso. As COVID-19 spurs online learning in high-income nations, the successful low-resource context adjustments and local partnership underlying this model attest that travel restrictions need not impede delivery of virtual CME conferences in lower-income nations. Attendee learning and the decreased cost and travel requirements allude to this platform's sustainability and reproducibility in facilitating future international education and capacity building. Further studies will assess long-term retention of presented material.","Ottesen, Taylor D; Montoya, Rachel L; Ogunleye, Temi D; Brown, Kelsey E; Woolley, Pierre Marie; Dejean, J M Christina Barau; Qudsi, Rameez A; Agarwal-Harding, Kiran J; Dyer, George S M",J. surg. educ,,193

DESIGN: cross-sectional study based on the record linkage of the COVID-19 notification system, the regional population health register and the 2011 census data. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: residents in Emilia-Romagna who were grouped according to three ESEMs calculated at census block level: the index of deprivation, the household crowding, and the percentage of the foreign resident population. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: counts of all deaths and those directly attributable to COVID-19. The association between mortality and ESEMs was assessed through rate differences and mortality rate ratios, estimated through Poisson models. RESULTS: during the outbreak peak, the nine provinces of the Emilia-Romagna Region were unequally hit by the COVID-19 outbreak, with Piacenza recording the highest COVID-19 absolute death toll and Ferrara the lowest. The overall and COVID-19 mortality burden was unequal also in terms of ecological socioeconomic measures. Percentage differences in the age-standardised mortality rates between the least and the most disadvantaged census blocks were greater for COVID-19 mortality than for overall mortality, suggesting that the Coronavirus outbreak has had a stronger impact on the most socioeconomically deprived areas. Although clear gradients were not always present, people living in the most disadvantaged census blocks experienced the highest absolute and relative risk of dying. Rate differences were larger among men, but mortality rate ratios were not always greater among men than women, especially for the COVID-19 mortality.

Some reports inaccurately referred to the panic buying as hoarding. Although hoarding is a separate issue characterised by extreme saving behaviour, the two problems may be influenced by similar factors. Participants from Australia and the United States (final N = 359) completed online self-report measures of panic buying, hoarding, shopping patterns, perceived scarcity, COVID-19 illness anxiety, selfishness, and intolerance of uncertainty. Our findings showed that panic buying was related to hoarding symptoms (r's = .23 - .36), and yet, both were uniquely associated with different psychological factors. Whilst panic buying was most strongly related to greater perceived scarcity (r's = .38 - .60), hoarding was most related to a general intolerance of uncertainty (r's = .24 - .57). Based on our findings, future strategies to prevent panic buying should focus on reducing perceived scarcity cues in the community, as this seems to be the primary driver of panic buying. Another preventative strategy to reduce excessive acquiring and saving may be to implement educational programs to increase people's ability to tolerate distress and uncertainty.","David, Jonathan; Visvalingam, Shanara; Norberg, Melissa M",Psychiatry Res,,193

Our study aimed to quantify the impact of COVID-19 on the short-term survival of cancer patients by comparing a period of 4 months after the outbreak began (2 March 2020) with an equal period from 2019. All cancer cases of the esophagus, stomach, colon and rectum, pancreas, lung, skin-melanoma, breast, cervix, and prostate, from the Portuguese Oncology Institute of Porto (IPO-Porto) and diagnosed between 2 March and 1 July of 2019 (before COVID-19) and 2020 (after COVID-19) were identified. Information regarding sociodemographic, clinical and treatment characteristics were collected from the cancer registry database and clinical files. Vital status was assessed to 31 October of the respective years. Cox proportional hazards regression was used to estimate crude and propensity score-adjusted hazards ratio (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) of death. During follow-up to 31 October, there were 154 (11.8%) deaths observed before COVID-19 and 131 (17.2%) after COVID-19, corresponding to crude and adjusted HRs (95% CI) of 1.51 (1.20-1.91) and 1.10 (0.86-1.40), respectively. Significantly higher adjusted hazards of death were observed for patients with Stage III cancer (HR = 2.37; 95% CI: 1.14-4.94) and those undergoing surgical treatment (HR = 3.97; 95% CI: 1.14-13.77) or receiving radiotherapy (HR = 1.96; 95% CI: 1.96-3.74), while patients who did not receive any treatment had a lower mortality hazards (HR = 0.62; 95% CI: 0.46-0.83). The higher overall short-term mortality observed during the COVID-19 pandemic largely reflects the effects of the epidemic on the case-mix of patients being diagnosed with cancer.","Morais, Samantha; Antunes, Luís; Rodrigues, Jéssica; Fontes, Filipa; Bento, Maria José; Lunet, Nuno",Int. j. cancer,,193
477207,"Rural-urban disparities in knowledge, behaviors, and mental health during COVID-19 pandemic: A community-based cross-sectional survey",2021,"BackgroundThe SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant (B.1.617.2), initially identified in India, has become predominant in several countries, including Portugal. Few studies have compared the effectiveness of mRNA vaccines against Delta versus Alpha variant of concern (VOC) and estimated variant-specific viral loads in vaccine infection breakthroughs cases. In the context of Delta dominance, this information is critical to inform decision-makers regarding the planning of restrictions and vaccination roll-out. MethodsWe developed a case-case study to compare mRNA vaccines effectiveness against Delta (B.1.617.2) versus Alpha (B.1.1.7) variants. We used RT-PCR positive cases notified to the National Surveillance System between 17th of May and 4th of July 2021 (week 20 to 26) and information about demographics and vaccination status through the electronic vaccination register. Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) or spike (S) gene target failure (SGTF) data were used to classify SARS-CoV-2 variants. The odds of vaccinated individuals to become infected (odds of vaccine infection breakthrough) in Delta cases compared to Alpha SARS-CoV-2 cases was estimated by conditional logistic regression adjusted for age group, sex, and matched by the week of diagnosis. As a surrogate of viral load, mean RT-PCR Ct values were stratified and compared between vaccine status and VOC. ResultsOf the 2 097 SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR positive cases included in the analysis, 966 (46.1%) were classified with WGS and 1131 (53.9%) with SGTF. Individuals infected with the Delta variant were more frequently vaccinated 162 (12%) than individuals infected with the Alpha variant 38 (5%). We report a statistically significant higher odds of vaccine infection breakthrough for partial (OR=1.70; CI95% 1.18 to 2.47) and complete vaccination (OR=1.96; CI95% 1.22 to 3.14) in the Delta cases when compared to the Alpha cases, suggesting lower mRNA vaccine effectiveness against Delta cases. On our secondary analysis, we observed lower mean Ct values for the Delta VOC cases versus Alpha, regardless the vaccination status. Additionally, the Delta variant cases revealed a Ct-value mean increase of 2.24 (CI95% 0.85 to 3.64) between unvaccinated and fully vaccinated breakthrough cases contrasting with 4.49 (CI95% 2.07 to 6.91) in the Alpha VOC, suggesting a lower impact of vaccine on viral load of Delta cases. ConclusionsWe found significantly higher odds of vaccine infection breakthrough in Delta cases when compared to Alpha cases, suggesting lower effectiveness of the mRNA vaccines in preventing infection with the Delta variant. Additionally, the vaccine breakthrough cases are estimated to be of higher mean Ct values, suggesting higher infectiousness with the Delta variant infection. These findings can help decision-makers weigh on the application or lifting of control measures and adjusting vaccine roll-out depending on the predominance of the Delta variant and the coverage of partial and complete mRNA vaccination.","IrinaKislaya, IK; EduardoFreireRodrigues, ER; VitorBorges, VB; JPG, Joao Paulo Gomes; CarlosSousa, CS; JPA, Jose Pedro Almeida; APS, Andre Peralta-Santos; BaltazarNunes, BN; Group, - PT-Covid-19",,,193

Despite considerable attention dedicated to COVID-19, the link between metabolic syndrome and SARS-CoV-2 infection remains unclear. Using data from the UK Biobank, we investigated the relationship between severity of COVID-19 and metabolic syndrome-related serum biomarkers measured prior to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Logistic regression analyses were used to test biomarker levels and biomarker-associated genetic variants with SARS-CoV-2-related outcomes. Among SARS-CoV-2-positive cases and negative controls, a 10 mg/dl increase in serum HDL-cholesterol or apolipoprotein A1 levels was associated with â¼10% reduced risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection, after adjustment for age, sex, obesity, hypertension, type 2 diabetes, and coronary artery disease. Evaluation of known genetic variants for HDL-cholesterol revealed that individuals homozygous for apolipoprotein E4 alleles had â¼2- to 3-fold higher risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection or mortality from COVID-19 compared with apolipoprotein E3 homozygotes, even after adjustment for HDL-cholesterol levels. However, cumulative effects of all evaluated HDL-cholesterol-raising alleles and Mendelian randomization analyses did not reveal association of genetically higher HDL-cholesterol levels with decreased risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection. These results implicate serum HDL-cholesterol and apolipoprotein A1 levels measured prior to SAR-CoV-2 exposure as clinical risk factors for severe COVID-19 infection but do not provide evidence that genetically elevated HDL-cholesterol levels are associated with SAR-CoV-2 infection.","Hilser, James R; Han, Yi; Biswas, Subarna; Gukasyan, Janet; Cai, Zhiheng; Zhu, Ruowei; Tang, W H Wilson; Deb, Arjun; Lusis, Aldons J; Hartiala, Jaana A; Allayee, Hooman",J Lipid Res,,193

This study aims to assess the insight of radiographers on how the COVID-19 pandemic has affected their work routine and if protective measures are applied. METHOD: A prospective observational study was conducted among radiographers registered in the Cyprus Society of Registered Radiologic Technologists & Radiation Therapy Technologists. A questionnaire composed of 28 multiple choice questions was utilised, and the data analysis was performed using SPSS software with the statistical significance assumed as p-value < 0.05. RESULTS: Out of 350 registered radiographers, 101 responses were received. The results showed that there are statistically significant differences regarding the working hours, the feeling of stress, the work effectiveness, the average examination time, the presence of a protocol used among the different workplaces of the participants; a private radiology centre, a private hospital or a public hospital, with a p-value 0.0022, 0.015, 0.027, 0.001, 0.0001 respectively. Also, statistically significant differences were observed in the decontamination methods used for equipment (p-value 0.007), for air (p-value 0.04) and when decontamination takes place (p-value 0.00032) among the different workplaces of the participants. Nonetheless, the majority of radiographers believe that their workplace is sufficiently provided with PPE, cleaning supplies, equipment, and with cleaning personnel and are optimistic regarding the adequacy of these provisions in the next three months. CONCLUSION: This study showed that in the Republic of Cyprus, there are protocols regarding protective measures against COVID-19, and the radiographers are adequately trained on how to face an infectious disease outbreak. However, work is needed in order to develop protocols that reassure the safety of patients and medical personnel while managing the excess workload effectively. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: This study indicates the importance of applying protective measures and protocols in the radiology departments in order to minimise the spread of the virus.","Zervides, C; Sassi, M; Kefala-Karli, P; Sassis, L",,,193

482798,Complex Reasons to Treat Covid-19-related Fever,2020,"Lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) older adults are at particular risk for receiving inequitable end-of-life care. Their health care wishes may be ignored or disregarded, their families of choice are less likely to be included in their decision making, and they may experience increased isolation, bullying, mistreatment, or abuse, which ultimately contribute to receipt of poor-quality health care. This is particularly important during sensitive transitions along the care continuum to end-of-life settings; 43% of respondents of a 2018 survey of 865 hospice professionals reported having directly observed discriminatory behavior toward LGBT patients. Lack of visibility and accountability perpetuates vulnerabilities and the potential for discriminatory treatment. Unfortunately, while other areas of health care have prioritized and normalized collecting sexual orientation and gender identity (SOGI) data, hospices do not routinely assess patients' SOGI in the context of end-of-life wishes and decisions. Drawing insight from a sample of 31 in-depth interviews with older LGBT adults, this paper focuses on one participant's story-Esther's. We chose her story to illustrate how care can be compromised at the end of life if an open discussion with patients about what and who matters most to them at the end of life, is avoided.","Candrian, Carey; Cloyes, Kristin G",GerontologistGerontologist,,193

The resulting geographic patterns describe the evolution of the epidemic and can indicate areas which are at risk of an outbreak. Here, we analyze the spatial correlations of new active cases in USA at the county level and characterize the extent of these correlations at different times. We show that the epidemic did not progress uniformly and we identify various stages which are distinguished by significant differences in the correlation length. Our results indicate that the correlation length may be large even during periods when the number of cases declines. We find that correlations between urban centers were much more significant than between rural areas and this finding indicates that long-range spreading was mainly facilitated by travel between cities, especially at the first months of the epidemic. We also show the existence of a percolation transition in November 2020, when the largest part of the country was connected to a spanning cluster, and a smaller-scale transition in January 2021, with both times corresponding to the peak of the epidemic in the country.","McMahon, Troy; Chan, Adrian; Havlin, Shlomo; Gallos, Lazaros K.",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.13960v1.pdf,193

483828,Mental Health Status among Healthcare Workers during COVID-19 Pandemic,2021,"INTRODUCTION: The SARS-Cov2 pandemic has caused considerable disruption to provision of routine outpatient care. This pandemic has necessitated a more modern and innovative approach to clinics, which could potentially change outpatient organisation and improve efficiency in the long term. Telephone clinics are the most practical way to deliver healthcare at a distance. AIM: The purpose of the present study was to assess patient satisfaction with a virtual telephone clinic in a tertiary referral centre for otolaryngology first during the height of the SARS-Cov2 pandemic, and subsequently at a physical follow-up appointment after easing of ""lockdown"" measures. METHODS: Patients were enrolled prospectively via a telephone interview over a 1-week period during the height of the ""lockdown"" measures, and subsequently at a physical appointment when measures eased. RESULTS: Overall, patients responded very positively in the anonymised questionnaire at the time of their virtual appointment. However, at a subsequent physical appointment, there was a reduction in overall favourable responses from patients. While patients still thought virtual clinics were a good idea and convenient in the context of SARS-Cov2, we noted a reduction in satisfaction in other key aspects of their care. Notably, patients were less likely to think that virtual clinics were able to properly address their condition. CONCLUSION: While virtual clinics remain a useful tool during the height of lockdown measures during the SARS-Cov2 pandemic, we did note a significant reduction in favourable responses to virtual appointments over physical ones upon easing of lockdown measures. Patients remained cautious in suggesting that outpatient appointments may be replaced by virtual clinics.","Hintze, Justin M; O039,; Riordan, Isobel; Hussain, Tanvir; Keane, Emma; Casserly, Paula",Ir. j. med. sci,,193

End-to-end networks that learn to focus selectively on regions of an image or video often perform strongly. However, other image regions, while not necessarily containing the signal of interest, may contain useful context. We present an approach that exploits the idea that statistics of noise may be shared between the regions that contain the signal of interest and those that do not. Our technique uses the inverse of an attention mask to generate a noise estimate that is then used to denoise temporal observations. We apply this to the task of camera-based physiological measurement. A convolutional attention network is used to learn which regions of a video contain the physiological signal and generate a preliminary estimate. A noise estimate is obtained by using the pixel intensities in the inverse regions of the learned attention mask, this in turn is used to refine the estimate of the physiological signal. We perform experiments on two large benchmark datasets and show that this approach produces state-of-the-art results, increasing the signal-to-noise ratio by up to 5.8 dB, reducing heart rate and breathing rate estimation error by as much as 30%, recovering subtle pulse waveform dynamics, and generalizing from RGB to NIR videos without retraining.","Nowara, Ewa; McDuff, Daniel; Veeraraghavan, Ashok",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.07770v1.pdf,193

489933,COVID-19 pandemic: Innovative digital tool using progressive muscle relaxation to promote mental health among frontline healthcare workers,2021,"COVID-19 led to the widespread withdrawal of face-to-face hospital-based clinical placements, with many medical schools switching to online learning. This precipitated concern about potential negative impact on clinical and interprofessional skill acquisition. To overcome this problem, we piloted a 12-week COVID-19 safe face-to-face clinical placement for 16 medical students at the Hospital for Tropical Diseases, London, during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. COVID-19 infection control measures necessitated that students remained in 'social bubbles' for placement duration. This facilitated an apprenticeship-style teaching approach, integrating students into the clinical team for placement duration. Team-based learning was adopted to develop and deliver content. Teaching comprised weekly seminars, experiential ward-based attachments and participation in quality improvement and research projects. The taught content was evaluated through qualitative feedback, reflective practice, and pre-apprenticeship and post-apprenticeship confidence questionnaires across 17 domains. Students' confidence improved in 14 of 17 domains (p<0.05). Reflective practice indicated that students valued the apprenticeship model, preferring the longer clinical attachment to existent shorter, fragmented clinical placements. Students described improved critical thinking, group cohesion, teamwork, self-confidence, self-worth and communication skills. This article describes a framework for the safe and effective delivery of a longer face-to-face apprenticeship-based clinical placement during an infectious disease pandemic. Longer apprenticeship-style attachments have hidden benefits to general professional training, which should be explored by medical schools both during the COVID-19 pandemic and, possibly, for any future clinical placements.","Stout, Rebecca C; Roberts, Sophie; Maxwell-Scott, Hector; Gothard, Philip",Postgrad. med. j,,193
491065,The Development of a Novel Outpatient Infusion Therapy Center for Treatment of COVID-19 in a Rural Healthcare System,2021,"The newly emerged severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) coronavirus initiated a pneumonia outbreak (COVID-19) that rapidly spread worldwide and quickly became a public health emergency of international concern; However to date, except Remdesivir, there are no clinically approved specific or effective medicines to prevent or treat COVID-19. Therefore, the development of novel treatments against coronavirus infections caused by the current SARS-CoV-2 virus, as well as other highly pathogenic human coronaviruses, represents an urgent unmet need. Stimulator of interferon genes (STING) plays a central role in host defense mechanisms against microbial infections. STING activation leads to the induction of both type I interferon and autophagy responses, which elicit strong inhibitory effect against the infections caused by a broad range of microbial pathogens. However, whether STING activation can impact infections from SARS-CoV-2 or other coronaviruses remains largely unknown. In this study, we investigated the anti-coronavirus activity triggered by STING activation. We discovered that dimeric amidobenzimidazole (diABZI), a synthetic small molecule STING receptor agonist, showed potent anti-coronavirus activity against both the common cold human coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E) and SARS-CoV-2 in cell culture systems. In addition, we demonstrated that the antiviral activity of diABZI was dependent on the interferon pathway in HCoV-229E infected normal human fibroblast lung cells (MRC-5) and reconstituted primary human airway air-liquid interface (ALI) cultures. Furthermore, low-dose of diABZI treatment at 0.1 µM effectively reduced the SARS-CoV-2 viral load at the epithelial apical surface and prevented epithelial damage in the reconstituted primary human bronchial airway epithelial ALI system. Our findings have thus revealed the therapeutic potential of STING agonists, such as diABZI, as treatments for SARS-CoV-2 and other human coronavirus infections.","Zhu, Qingyuan; Zhang, Yaling; Wang, Li; Yao, Xiangyu; Wu, Daitze; Cheng, Junjun; Pan, Xiaoyu; Liu, Haixia; Yan, Zhipeng; Gao, Lu",Antiviral Res,,193

Methods: From February 2nd to 16th, 2020, 106 COVID-19 patients were anonymously investigated for their mental health status using online questionnaires (including Patient Health Questionnaire-9, Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale-7, Patient Health Questionnaire-15 scales). The patients were from Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology. After data processing, SPSS19.0 was used for statistical analysis. Results: Of the 106 COVID-19 patients, 46 were male and 60 were female, with an age of (35.90±11.92) years. The detection rates of depression, anxiety and somatic symptoms in those patients were 49.06% (52/106), 56.60% (60/106) and 69.81% (74/106) respectively. The severe cases of depression (scale score greater than 19), anxiety (scale score greater than 14) and somatic symptoms (scale score greater than 14) accounted for 9.43% (10/106), 15.09% (16/106) and 20.75% (22/106) respectively. In addition, 67.92% (72/106) of the patients had sleep problems, 24.53% (26/106) had self-mutilating or suicidal thoughts, and 28.30% (30/106) required psychological counseling-all of which were at significantly higher percentages than those of the general population. Only 39.62% (42/106) of the examined patients had neither deression nor anxiety. By using the non-parametric test of rank conversion for analysis, the results showed that both married patients and nucleic-acid-positive patients had more severe depressions, and both married patients and anoxemic patients had more severe somatic symptoms. Conclusion: This mental health assessment showed that depression, anxiety, and various somatic symptoms exist among the COVID-19 patients, and therefore early identification and intervention should be conducted to avoid extreme events such as self-mutilating or suicidal impulsivity, with a greater focus on both married patients and patients with severe symptoms.","Zhao, Qian; Hu, Caihong; Feng, Renjie; Yang, Yuan",Chin.

To fight COVID-19, various traditional antiviral medicines have been prescribed in China to infected patients with mild to moderate symptoms and received unexpected success in controlling the disease. However, the molecular mechanisms of how these herbal medicines interact with the SARS-CoV-2 virus that causes COVID-19 have remained elusive. It is well known that the main protease (Mpro) of SARS-CoV-2 plays an important role in maturation of many viral proteins such as the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. Here, we explore the underlying molecular mechanisms of the computationally determined top candidate, namely, rutin which is a key component in many traditional antiviral medicines such as Lianhuaqinwen and Shuanghuanlian, for inhibiting the viral target-Mpro. Using in silico methods (docking and molecular dynamics simulations), we revealed the dynamics and energetics of rutin when interacting with the Mpro of SARS-CoV-2, suggesting that the highly hydrophilic rutin molecule can be bound inside the Mpro's pocket (active site) and possibly inhibit its biological functions. In addition, we optimized the structure of rutin and designed two more hydrophobic analogs, M1 and M2, which satisfy the rule of five for western medicines and demonstrated that they (M2 in particular) possess much stronger binding affinities to the SARS-COV-2s Mpro than rutin, due to the enhanced hydrophobic interaction as well as more hydrogen bonds. Therefore, our results provide invaluable insights into the mechanism of a ligand's binding inside the Mpro and shed light on future structure-based designs of high-potent inhibitors for SARS-CoV-2 Mpro.","Huynh, Tien; Wang, Haoran; Luan, Binquan",Phys Chem Chem Phys,,193

METHODS AND RESULTS: Electronic databases were searched to identify published studies that reported clinical outcomes in patients with COVID-19 who were or were not taking an ACEI/ARB. We studied all-cause mortality and/or severe disease outcomes. Fully adjusted effect estimates from individual studies were pooled using a random-effects model. In total, 34 (31 cohort-based and three case-control) studies met our eligibility criteria. Due to the inherent differences between cohort and case-control studies, we did not combine results of these studies but used them to identify the consistency of their results. The 31 cohort studies provided outcome data for 87â951 patients with COVID-19, of whom 22â383/83â963 (26.7%) were on ACEI/ARB therapy. In pooled analysis, we found no association between the use of ACEI/ARB and all-cause mortality/severe disease [relative risk: 0.94, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.86-1.03, I2â=â57%, Pâ=â0.20] or occurrence of severe disease (relative risk: 0.93, 95% CI: 0.74-1.17, I2â=â56%, Pâ=â0.55). Analysis of three population-based case-control studies identified no significant association between ACEI/ARB (pooled odds ratio: 1.00, 95% CI: 0.81-1.23, I2â=â0, Pâ=â0.98) and all-cause mortality/severe disease. In 13 of the 31 cohort studies as well as in three case-control studies that reported outcomes separately for ACEI and ARB, there was no differential effect for mortality/severe disease outcomes. CONCLUSION: In patients with COVID-19, we found no association between ACEI/ARB treatment and mortality/severe disease. ACEI/ARB should not be discontinued, unless clinically indicated.","Bavishi, Chirag; Whelton, Paul K; Mancia, Giuseppe; Corrao, Giovanni; Messerli, Franz H",J. hypertens,,193
500160,COVID-19 in aged care homes: a comparison of effects initial government policies had in the UK (primarily focussing on England) and Australia during the first wave,2021,"BACKGROUND: COVID-19-related ARDS has unique features when compared with ARDS from other origins, suggesting a distinctive inflammatory pathogenesis. Data regarding the host response within the lung are sparse. The objective is to compare alveolar and systemic inflammation response patterns, mitochondrial alarmin release, and outcomes according to ARDS etiology (i.e., COVID-19 vs. non-COVID-19). METHODS: Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and plasma were obtained from 7 control, 7 non-COVID-19 ARDS, and 14 COVID-19 ARDS patients. Clinical data, plasma, and epithelial lining fluid (ELF) concentrations of 45 inflammatory mediators and cell-free mitochondrial DNA were measured and compared. RESULTS: COVID-19 ARDS patients required mechanical ventilation (MV) for significantly longer, even after adjustment for potential confounders. There was a trend toward higher concentrations of plasma CCL5, CXCL2, CXCL10, CD40 ligand, IL-10, and GM-CSF, and ELF concentrations of CXCL1, CXCL10, granzyme B, TRAIL, and EGF in the COVID-19 ARDS group compared with the non-COVID-19 ARDS group. Plasma and ELF CXCL10 concentrations were independently associated with the number of ventilator-free days, without correlation between ELF CXCL-10 and viral load. Mitochondrial DNA plasma and ELF concentrations were elevated in all ARDS patients, with no differences between the two groups. ELF concentrations of mitochondrial DNA were correlated with alveolar cell counts, as well as IL-8 and IL-1ß concentrations. CONCLUSION: CXCL10 could be one key mediator involved in the dysregulated immune response. It should be evaluated as a candidate biomarker that may predict the duration of MV in COVID-19 ARDS patients. Targeting the CXCL10-CXCR3 axis could also be considered as a new therapeutic approach.

Evidence to support speculation includes in vitro evidence for humoral and cellular cross-reactivity with SARS-CoV-2 in specimens obtained before the pandemic started. METHOD: We used retrospective health insurance enrollment records, claims, and laboratory results to assemble a cohort of 869,236 insured individuals who had a PCR test for SARS-CoV-2. We estimated the effects of having clinical encounters for various diagnostic categories in the year preceding the study period on the risk of a positive test result. FINDINGS: After adjusting for age, gender and care seeking behavior, we identified that individuals with diagnoses for common cold symptoms, including acute sinusitis, bronchitis, or pharyngitis in the preceding year had a lower risk of testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 (OR=0.76, 95%CI=0.75, 0.77). No reduction in the odds of a positive test for SARS-CoV-2 was seen in individuals under 18 years. The reduction in odds in adults remained stable for four years but was strongest in those with recent common cold symptoms. INTERPRETATION: While this study cannot attribute this association to cross-immunity resulting from a prior CCC infection, it is one potential explanation. Regardless of the cause, the reduction in the odds of being infected by SARS-CoV-2 among those with a recent diagnosis of common cold symptoms may have a role in shifting future COVD-19 infection patterns from endemic to episodic.","Aran, Dvir; Beachler, Daniel C; Lanes, Stephan; Overhage, J Marc",J Infect,,193

Cohort studies with risk factors for repeated RSP or information about the immunoglobulin response (immunoglobulin M (IgM) and/or immunoglobulin G (IgG)) were included in this analysis. The main examined risk factors were severity of the initial infection, body mass index (BMI), length of hospitalization (LOH), age, and gender, for which we pooled mean differences and odds ratios (ORs). Thirty-four cohort studies (N = 9269) were included in our analysis. We found that increased RSP rate might be associated with IgG positivity; IgG presence was higher in RSP patients (OR: 1.72, CI: 0.87-3.41, p = 0.117). Among the examined risk factors, only mild initial disease course showed a significant association with RSP (OR: 0.3, CI: 0.14-0.67, p = 0.003).

507523,Comparison of psychological symptoms between infected and non-infected COVID-19 health care workers,2021,"Autoimmunity may be generated by a variety of factors by creating a hyper-stimulated state of the immune system. It had been established long ago that viruses are a substantial component of environmental factors that contribute to the production of autoimmune antibodies, as well as autoimmune diseases. Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), cytomegalovirus (CMV) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) are viruses that withhold these autoimmune abilities. In a similar manner, SARS-CoV-2 may be counted to similar manifestations, as numerous records demonstrating the likelihood of COVID-19 patients to develop multiple types of autoantibodies and autoimmune diseases. In this review, we focused on the association between COVID-19 and the immune system concerning the tendency of patients to develop over 15 separate types of autoantibodies and above 10 distinct autoimmune diseases. An additional autoimmunity manifestation may be one of the common initial symptoms in COVID-19 patients, anosmia, the complete loss of the ability to sense smell, and other olfactory alterations. We summarize current knowledge on principal mechanisms that may contribute to the development of autoimmunity in the disease: the ability of SARS-CoV-2 to hyper-stimulate the immune system, induce excessive neutrophil extracellular traps formation with neutrophil-associated cytokine responses and the molecular resemblance between self-components of the host and the virus. Additionally, we will examine COVID-19 potential risk on the new-onsets of autoimmune diseases, such as antiphospholipid syndrome, Guillain-Barré syndrome, Kawasaki disease and numerous others. It is of great importance to recognize those autoimmune manifestations of COVID-19 in order to properly cope with their outcomes in the ongoing pandemic and the long-term post-pandemic period. Lastly, an effective vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 may be the best solution in dealing with the ongoing pandemic. We will discuss the new messenger RNA vaccination strategy with an emphasis on autoimmunity implications.","Dotan, Arad; Muller, Sylviane; Kanduc, Darja; David, Paula; Halpert, Gilad; Shoenfeld, Yehuda",Autoimmun Rev,,193

We aimed to investigate the incidence, characteristics, and prognosis of acute stroke in geriatric patients hospitalized with COVID-19. METHODS: A monocentric cross-sectional retrospective study of 265 older patients hospitalized with COVID-19 on acute geriatric wards. 11/265 presented a stroke episode during hospitalization. Mortality rates and two-group comparisons (stroke vs non-stroke patients) were calculated and significant variables added in logistic regression models to investigate stroke risk factors. RESULTS: Combined ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke incidence was 4.15%. 72.7% of events occurred during acute care. Strokes presented with altered state of consciousness and/or delirium in 81.8%, followed by a focal neurological deficit in 45.5%. Ischemic stroke was more frequently unilateral (88.8%) and localized in the middle cerebral artery territory (55.5%). Smoking and a history of previous stroke increased by more than seven (OR 7.44; 95% CI 1.75-31.64; p = 0.007) and five times (OR 5.19; 95% CI 1.50-17.92; p = 0.009), respectively, the risk of stroke.

Here, we describe an optimized and very simple FACS assay based on staining a mix of two Jurkat cell lines, expressing either high levels of the S protein (Jurkat-S) or the mCherry fluorescent protein (Jurkat-R, which serve as an internal negative control). We show that this Jurkat-S&R-flow test has a much broader dynamic range than a commercial ELISA test and performs at least as well in terms of sensitivity and specificity. Also, it is more sensitive and quantitative than the hemagglutination-based test HAT, which we described recently. The Jurkat-R&S-flow test requires only a few microliters of blood; thus, it can be used to quantify various Ig isotypes in capillary blood collected from a finger prick. It can be used also to evaluate serological responses in mice, cats and dogs. FACS tests offer a very attractive solution for laboratories with access to tissue culture and flow cytometry who want to monitor serological responses in humans or in animals, and how these relate to susceptibility to infection, or re-infection, by the virus, and to protection against Covid-19.","Ribes, Agnes Maurel; Bessiere, Pierre; Guery, Jean-Charles; Featherstone, Eloise Joly; Bruel, Timothee; Robinot, Remy; Schwartz, Olivier; Abravanel, Florence; Izopet, Jacques; Joly, Etienne",,,193

More than 20 million people have already been infected by the virus. ACE2 is not only a functional receptor of COVID-19 but also an important endogenous antagonist of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS). A large number of studies have shown that ACE2 can reverse myocardial injury in various cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) as well as is exert anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, anti-apoptotic and anticardiomyocyte fibrosis effects by regulating transforming growth factor beta, mitogen-activated protein kinases, calcium ions in cells and other major pathways. The ACE2/angiotensin-(1-7)/Mas receptor axis plays a decisive role in the cardiovascular system to combat the negative effects of the ACE/angiotensin II/angiotensin II type 1 receptor axis. However, the underlying mechanism of ACE2 in cardiac protection remains unclear. Some approaches for enhancing ACE2 expression in CVDs have been suggested, which may provide targets for the development of novel clinical therapies.

DESIGN: Retrospective consecutive case series. PARTICIPANTS: One hundred and ninety eyes of 188 patients with primary, rhegmatogenous RD. METHODS: Patients with RD who presented over a 1-year period (September 14, 2019 to September 13, 2020). The relationship between demographic, anatomic, and visual acuity parameters were compared before and after onset of the pandemic using generalized estimating equations. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Macular status and corrected distance visual acuity on presentation. RESULTS: One hundred and eighty-seven eyes, divided into 2 cohorts: pre-COVID (nâ¯=â¯100 September 14, 2019 to March 13, 2020) and post-COVID (nâ¯=â¯87, March 14, 2020 to September 13, 2020). Of the eyes, 63.2% (nâ¯=â¯87) presented with macular detachment in the post-COVID group compared with 45% (nâ¯=â¯100) in the pre-COVID group (odds ration [OR], 2.14; 95% confidence interval [CI],1.19-3.86; pâ¯=â¯0.011). As well, eyes in the pre-pandemic cohort had significantly fewer detached quadrants on initial examination (OR, 0.53; 95% CI, 0.30-0.93; pâ¯=â¯0.026). Patients in the post-COVID group had a significantly worse corrected distance visual acuity at baseline (mean difference [MD]â¯=â¯-0.35 logMAR, 95% CI, -0.60 to -0.09; pâ¯=â¯0.008), but not at 1 month or at final follow-up. No differences were seen between groups with respect to demographics, lens status, treatment, time to presentation, or chronicity. Pneumatic retinopexy was the most commonly performed procedure in both cohorts, with a 71.5% success rate. CONCLUSIONS: Closures after the COVID-19 pandemic affected the characteristics of RDs at presentation with respect to macular detachment, extent of RD, and presenting visual acuity.

These data are helpful for future patient education, triaging, and treatment decision making.","Arjmand, Parnian; Murtaza, Fahmeeda; Eshtiaghi, Arshia; Popovic, Marko M; Kertes, Peter J; Eng, Kenneth T",Can. j. ophthalmol,,193
511403,Association Between Perceived Resilience and Mental Well-Being of Saudi Nursing Students During COVID-19 Pandemic: A Cross-Sectional Study,2021,"Acute kidney injury is a common complication, affecting up to 37% of hospitalized patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection and is proportional to its severity and portends poor prognosis. Diverse mechanisms have been proposed and studies reported conflicting results. Moreover, renal tropism of SARS-CoV-2 does not equate to its renal pathogenicity. For a virus to be pathogenic, in addition to its affinity (tropism) for specific tissue(s), host cells must allow viral entry, and discuss the important role played by transmembrane protease, serine 2 (TMPRSS2) and co-expression of both ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in the same cells is important to cause damage. Lack of co-expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in the same cells of the kidneys is the limiting factor of SARS-CoV-2 direct effects in the kidney. We present the rationale and cumulative evidence supporting that acute kidney injury is secondary to hemodynamic and immunologic effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection than the direct injury or infection.","Parmar, Malvinder S",Nephrology (Carlton),,193

tzv SHARE Corona Studija SHARE danas se suočava s brojnim izazovima, od kojih valja istaknuti zadržavanje europske pokrivenosti zbog nedostatnog financiranja, ali i budućeg načina provedbe ankete zbog utjecaja bolesti COVID-19 Alternate abstract:The Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe (SHARE) is a multidisci¬plinary and cross-national panel database of microdata on health, socio-economic status and social and family networks of about 140,000 individuals aged 50 or older SHARE covers 27 European countries and Israel It is a research infrastructure that the European Commission has positioned as one of the priority projects in the Euro¬pean Research Area and one of the most significant panel studies in social sciences This paper aims to present the methodological profile of the SHARE study with a specific reference to the period since 2015 when Croatia joined it It also examines the process of SHARE study implementation in Croatia with a detailed presentation of modules and questions from the questionnaires in the sixth and seventh waves The specific purpose of this paper is to emphasise the content and research opportunities of the SHARE study for the Croatian scholarly community This paper highlights the specific aspects of the eighth wave of SHARE in which face-to-face interviewing has been suspended due to the coronavirus pandemic, and a methodological turn has been made, i e face-to-face interviews have been replaced with a short CATI (telephone) survey called ""SHARE Corona "" As a panel study, SHARE collects data in waves, every two years since 2004, sup¬ported by CAPI (computer-assisted personal interviewing) A SHARE interview is quite long, with an approximate duration of one hour Same respondents are inter¬viewed in regular waves, but new respondents can be added to refresher samples New respondents help to maintain the core sample and deal with sample attrition However, SHARE invests significant efforts in recovering panel respondents who have participated in the previous waves The strategy to minimise the absence of panel respondents includes regular contact with respondents, i e panel care (send¬ing birthday cards, season's greetings, brochures with selected SHARE results to re¬spondents or providing incentives) The SHARE study relies on ex-ante harmonisa¬tion and includes a core survey instrument that is common in all member countries Strict comparability is crucial Comparability is ascertained through identical ques¬tion design, a careful translation process with external certification, an electronic survey instrument (CAPI, CASE CTRL starting from Wave 8), and common training procedures ascertained by a train-the-trainer programme In addition to the variety of electronic instruments, SHARE relies on several ""physical"" survey instruments, which are mainly used to obtain objective health measures These instruments in¬clude dynamometers (to measure respondents' grip strength) and peak flow me¬ters (to measure respondents' lung capacity) Besides, SHARE collects da a from the walking speed test and chair stand test, data on waist circumference, self-reported weight and height, and biomarkers from a sample of dried blood spots (HbA1c, total cholesterol, C-reactive protein and vitamin D) In the participating SHARE countries, the institutional conditions with respect to sampling are so different that a uniform sampling design for the entire project is infeasible Good sampling frames for the target population of 50+ individuals and households with at least one 50+ individual do not exist or cannot be used in all countries Most countries keep registers of individuals that enable stratification by age In some of them, these registers are maintained at a regional level In these cases, a two- or multi-stage design is needed, in which regions are sampled first, and then individuals are selected within these regions As a result, sampling designs used vary from a simple random selection of households to rather complicated multi-stage de¬signs Taking into account the size of the population in each participating country, SHARE calculates weights to reduce the potential selection bias associated with non-response errors In the Croatian wave six, the sampling of potential respondents was based on probabilities from the administrative register of age-appropriate individu¬als From the database of insured persons of the Croatian Health Insurance Fund (HZZO), 4,990 persons born in 1963 and earlier were randomly selected Each person received an invitation letter for participation in the SHARE study in Croatia The response rate in SHARE wave six was 43 7% at the household level, while the indi¬vidual response rate was 41 9% These rates resulted in 2,495 individual surveys con¬ducted in 1,588 households in Croatia In all countries that had refresher samples, the response rate was 51 3% at the household level and 46 8% at the individual level The seventh SHARE wave, called SHARELIFE, was mainly retrospective, accomplishing a full EU coverage As a part of the seventh wave, a relatively small refresher sample was selected in Croatia i e 346 interviews were conducted in 234 households The minimum satisfactory response rate of 30% was achieved at the household level In Croatia, the retention rate of respondents in the seventh wave was 84 6%, which was the highest retention rate of respondents between waves six and seven In Slovenia, it was 82 9%, in Greece 82 8%, in Estonia 82 2%, in Belgium 70 4%, in France 64 9%, and in Italy 62% That retention rate in Croatia resulted in 2,062 SHARELIFE inter¬views with an additional 101 end-of-life interviews (interviews about the last year of life of a deceased respondent) The sampling procedure for the refresher sample in wave eight in Croatia followed the standard phases of two-stage sampling Primary sampling units were polling stations selected based on a probability proportional to the number of voters aged 50+ at each polling station The sample was stratified by counties and by settlement size In the second phase, the gross sample of individuals aged 50 or older was selected randomly The representativeness of the sample was achieved by weighting a set of eight calibration variables (men and women in age groups 50–59, 60–69, 70–79, and 80+) Following the spread of the coronavirus pandemic across Europe, in March 2020, all SHARE countries suspended field surveys By that date, 1,279 panel interviews (including end-of-life interviews) and 835 refresher interviews had been collected in Croatia In response to the pandemic, the SHARE Central, in cooperation with national teams, created the SHARE Corona questionnaire, designed for a computer-assisted telephone interview (CATI), lasting about 20–25 minutes This survey, con¬ducted in 27 European countries and Israel from June to August 2020, included panel respondents only The SHARE study is a prime example of a truly European research infrastructure that exists largely because of its European dimension It is crucial to point out that the data collected by the survey questionnaire are harmonised ex-ante across Europe, which significantly contributes to the improvement of international comparative re¬search The main value of this project lies with the diversity of collected data, with each participating country contributing to this diversity with data on living condi¬tions, health, pension and social policies Therefore, SHARE is much more than just a group of national surveys The SHARE study today faces a number of challenges, the most prominent ones being the retention of European coverage due to lack of fund¬ing and the future method of surveying in the light of COVID-19 In Croatia, joining the SHARE study was marked by significant challenges Firstly, SHARE is the first longitudinal study on demographic ageing conducted in our country Secondly, the SHARE survey requires ample financial resources, so the size of the Croatian sam¬ple had to be adjusted accordingly and to meet high scientific standards set by the SHARE study The third significant challenge that the SHARE research team faced were barriers to accessing the sampling framework Substantial efforts were under¬taken to demonstrate that the SHARE study adheres to all ethical standards and regulations related to the protection of the personal data of respondents Another is¬sue was the limited number of survey agencies in Croatia that can conduct demand¬ing surveys of this type This was especially evident in the sixth wave, when certain logistical issues arose because the fieldwork phase started quite late (end of June 2015), leading to the stagnation of surveys in some parts of the country (Dalmatia, Istria) Difficulties related to the recruitment of interviewers and their withdrawal in the early stages of the survey required significantefforts during the last month of the fieldwork However, experiences from the sixth wave contributed to the extremely successful implementation of the seventh wave (SHARELIFE)","Smolić, Šime Čipin Ivan Fabijančić Margareta Mustač

511796,Using an Extended Technology Acceptance Model to Understand the Factors Influencing Telehealth Utilization After Flattening the COVID-19 Curve in South Korea: Cross-sectional Survey Study,2021,"IntroductionCOVID-19 has caused major disruptions to healthcare, with voluntary opportunities offered to medical students to provide clinical support. We used the conceptual framework of prosocial behavior during an emergency - behaviors whose primary focus is benefiting others - to examine volunteering during COVID-19. MethodsWe conducted an in-depth, mixed-methods cross-sectional survey, from 2nd May to 15th June 2020, of medical students studying at UK medical schools. Data analysis was informed by Latane and Darleys theory of prosocial behavior during an emergency and aimed to understand students decision-making processes. ResultsA total of 1145 medical students from 36 medical schools completed the survey. While 947 (82.7%) of students were willing to volunteer, only 391 (34.3%) had volunteered. The majority (92.7%) of students understood that they may be asked to volunteer; however, we found that deciding ones responsibility to volunteer was mitigated by a complex interaction between the interests of others and self-interest. Further, concerns revolving around professional role boundaries influenced students decisions over whether they had the required skills and knowledge to volunteer. Deciding to volunteer depended not only on possession of necessary skills, but also seniority and identification with the nature of volunteering roles offered. ConclusionsWe propose two additional domains to Latane and Darleys theory of prosocial behavior during an emergency that students consider before making their final decision to volunteer. These are logistics - whether it is logistically feasible to volunteer - and safety - whether it is safe to volunteer. This study highlights a number of modifiable barriers to prosocial behavior that medical students encounter and provides suggestions regarding how Latane and Darleys theory of prosocial behavior can be operationalized within educational strategies to address these barriers. Optimizing the process of volunteering can aid healthcare provision and may facilitate a safer volunteering process for all.","Byrne, Matthew H V; Ashcroft, James; Wan, Jonathan C M; Alexander, Laith; Harvey, Anna; Schindler, Nicholas; Brown, Megan E L; Brassett, Cecilia",,,193

512840,Mental Health Consequences of Lockdown During the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Cross-Sectional Study,2021,"OBJECTIVE: The primary aim of this study was to investigate whether students in minority race categories are more likely to experience race-related bias and hatred in their lifetime and since the onset of COVID-19, after controlling the effect of demographic and other variables. METHODS: This quantitative study used primary data from the survey of 1249 college students at one of the universities in Georgia during April and May 2020. We performed multinomial logistic regression, computing 2 models for the 2 ordinal dependent variables concerning students' experience of race-related bias and hatred-(a) during their lifetime and (b) since the onset of COVID-19 in March 2020-both measured as ""never,"" ""rarely,"" ""sometimes,"" and ""fairly often or very often."" RESULTS: During their lifetime, 47.5% of students had experienced some level of bias or hatred, ranging from ""rarely"" to ""very often."" Since the onset of COVID-19 on March 2 in Georgia, in a short period of 1 to 2 months, 17.6% of students reported experiencing race-related bias or hatred. Univariate statistics revealed substantial differences in race-related bias and hatred by race, experienced during students' lifetime as well as since the onset of COVID-19. Results of multinomial logistic regression showed that the odds of having experienced bias or hatred during their lifetime were significantly higher (P < .05) for the Black students than for White students (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 75.8, for very often or often vs never; AOR = 42 for sometimes vs never). Compared with White students, the odds of hatred and bias were also significantly higher for students who were Asian, multiple races, or another non-White race. The odds of having experienced race-related bias and hatred since the onset of COVID-19 were also higher for Black Asian, multiple races, and other non-White students. CONCLUSIONS: This study adds critical scientific evidence about variation in the perception of bias and hatred that should draw policy attention to race-related issues experienced by college students in the United States.","Shah, Gulzar H; Rochani, Haresh D; Telfair, Joseph; Ayangunna, Elizabeth; Skuraton, Gemma",J Public Health Manag Pract,,193
515241,Prioritizing Primary Care Can Save the U.S. Health Care System,2021,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: In the absence of a vaccine or specific drug treatment options for coronavirus disease (COVID-19), attention has been shifted in China to the possible therapeutic use of convalescent plasma. COVID-19 convalescent plasma (CCP) is currently under investigation. We summarized clinical studies and other research data available as of 5 May 2020 on CCP therapy according to the Clinical Treatment Guideline of COVID-19 Convalescent Plasma in China, as well as clinical experience at the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University, as part of a comprehensive anti-epidemic strategy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: As of 5 May 2020, when the epidemic was well-controlled in China, healthcare databases and sources of English literature relating to convalescent plasma were searched and reviewed. Sources of clinical and methodological heterogeneity were identified. RESULTS: As of 5 May 2020, up to 2000 samples of CCP had been collected across China and administered to 700 COVID-19 patients. From donors, 200-400 ml of plasma was collected at each donation, with antibody titres > 1:160. We identified three clinical studies for COVID-19 in China. Analyses showed a statistically significant improvement in clinical outcomes compared with untreated cases (P < 0.001). No adverse effects were reported. CONCLUSION: From initial studies, convalescent plasma therapy appears effective and safe for COVID-19. However, there is clearly a need for well-designed RCTs (randomized controlled trials) or other formal studies to further evaluate the efficacy and any potential adverse effects of CCP.","Chen, Binzhen; Xia, Rong",Vox Sang,,193

Due to the pandemic, most countries affected have therefore imposed periods of full or partial lockdowns to restrict community transmission. This has had the welcome but unexpected side effect that existing levels of atmospheric pollutants, particularly in cities, have temporarily declined. As found by several authors, air quality can inherently exacerbate the risks linked to respiratory diseases, including COVID-19. In this study, we explore patterns of air pollution for ten of the most affected countries in the world, in the context of the 2020 development of the COVID-19 pandemic. We find that the concentrations of some of the principal atmospheric pollutants were temporarily reduced during the extensive lockdowns in the spring. Secondly, we show that the seasonality of the atmospheric pollutants is not significantly affected by these temporary changes, indicating that observed variations in COVID-19 conditions are likely to be linked to air quality. On this background, we confirm that air pollution may be a good predictor for the local and national severity of COVID-19 infections.","Singh, Ram Kumar; Drews, Martin; De la Sen, Manuel; Srivastava, Prashant Kumar; Trisasongko, Bambang H; Kumar, Manoj; Pandey, Manish Kumar; Anand, Akash; Singh, S S; Pandey, A K; Dobriyal, Manmohan; Rani, Meenu; Kumar, Pavan",Sci Rep,,193

The primary aim of this study was to describe the incidence, characteristics and outcomes of hospitalized pregnant women with symptomatic and asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 in the UK compared to pregnant women without SARS-CoV-2. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We conducted a national, prospective cohort study of all hospitalized pregnant women with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 from 01/03/2020 to 31/08/2020 using the UK Obstetric Surveillance System. Incidence rates were estimated using national maternity data. Overall, 1148 hospitalized women had confirmed SARS-CoV-2 in pregnancy, 63% of which were symptomatic. The estimated incidence of hospitalization with symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 was 2.0 per 1000 maternities (95% CI 1.9-2.2) and for asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 was 1.2 per 1000 maternities (95% CI 1.1-1.4). Compared to pregnant women without SARS-CoV-2, women hospitalized with symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 were more likely to be overweight or obese (adjusted OR 1.86, (95% CI 1.39-2.48) and aOR 2.07 (1.53-2.29)), to be of Black, Asian or Other minority ethnic group (aOR 6.24, (3.93-9.90), aOR 4.36, (3.19-5.95) and aOR 12.95, (4.93-34.01)), and to have a relevant medical comorbidity (aOR 1.83 (1.32-2.54)). Hospitalized pregnant women with symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 were more likely to be admitted to intensive care (aOR 57.67, (7.80-426.70)) but the absolute risk of poor outcomes was low. Cesarean births and neonatal unit admission were increased regardless of symptom status (symptomatic aOR 2.60, (1.97-3.42) and aOR 3.08, (1.99-4.77); asymptomatic aOR 2.02, (1.52-2.70) and aOR 1.84, (1.12-3.03)). The risks of stillbirth or neonatal death were not significantly increased, regardless of symptom status. CONCLUSIONS: We have identified factors that increase the risk of symptomatic and asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 in pregnancy. Clinicians can be reassured that the majority of women do not experience severe complications of SARS-CoV-2 in pregnancy.","Vousden, Nicola; Bunch, Kathryn; Morris, Edward; Simpson, Nigel; Gale, Christopher; O039,; Brien, Patrick; Quigley, Maria; Brocklehurst, Peter; Kurinczuk, Jennifer J; Knight, Marian",PLoS One,,193

This study aimed to obtain a more detailed understanding of the current mental health needs of these individuals, which is important for both the development of intervention strategies to better manage patient distress and to better prepare for similar circumstances in future. METHODS: The sample comprised 43 individuals with a verified diagnosis of BD and 24 healthy controls. Data about pandemic-related mental health support use, socio-demographics, mood, lifestyle, social rhythm and subjective cognitive dysfunction data were collected and compared between groups. Inter-relationships between scores were also examined. RESULTS: No between-group differences were found in terms of age, sex, living situation, job loss or reduced work hours due to COVID-19. Most patients with BD reported a history of ongoing formal psychological support (68.3%), with most continuing this support throughout the pandemic (82.1%). A large, statistically significant pandemic-related increase in subjective cognitive dysfunction was evident in the BD group. Subjective cognitive dysfunction was significantly associated with negative symptomology, suicidal thoughts, and quality of life ratings. LIMITATIONS: Data was collected in self-report format in an online survey and objective symptom measures were not used at this time CONCLUSION: The absenceof substantial differences between patients and controls in terms of mood symptoms, COVID-19 fear or lifestyle factors and social rhythms suggests a degree of resilience in BD patients; despite large pandemic related increases in subjective cognitive dysfunction.","Karantonis, James A; Rossell, Susan L; Berk, Michael; Van Rheenen, Tamsyn E",J Affect Disord,,193

This study examined whether emotional disorder symptoms and transdiagnostic vulnerabilities during adolescence predicted young adult substance use during COVID-19, and whether using substances to cope with the pandemic's social conditions mediated these associations. Adolescents (N = 2,120) completed baseline surveys assessing transdiagnostic emotional vulnerabilities (anhedonia, distress intolerance, anxiety sensitivity, negative urgency) and symptoms (major depression[MD], generalized anxiety[GAD], panic disorder[PD], social phobia[SP], obsessive-compulsive disorder[OCD]) in adolescence (September-December 2016; M[SD] age = 17.45[0.38]). At follow-up (May-August 2020; M[SD] age = 21.16[0.39]), past 30-day substance use and using substances to cope with social isolation during the pandemic were reported. Adjusted models showed that baseline distress intolerance, anxiety sensitivity, negative urgency, and MD symptoms each significantly predicted higher number of past-month single-substance using days and number of substances used at follow-up (ßs = 0.04-0.06). In each case, associations were mediated by tendency to use substances to cope with the pandemic (ßindirect range: 0.028-0.061). To mitigate disproportionate escalation of substance use in young adults with a history of certain types of emotional disturbance, interventions promoting healthy coping strategies to deal with the pandemic's social conditions warrant consideration.","Cho, Junhan; Bello, Mariel S; Christie, Nina C; Monterosso, John R; Leventhal, Adam M",Cogn Behav Ther,,193

One open question is whether genetics could influence the severity of symptoms. Considering the limited data on cancer patients, we analyzed public data repositories limited to investigate angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and the transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2) expressions and genetic variants to identify the basis of individual susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2.Gene expression and variant data were retrieved from Tissue Cancer Genome Atlas, Genotype-Tissue Expression, and gnomAD. Differences in gene expression were tested with Mann-Whitney U-test. Allele frequencies of germline variants were explored in different ethnicities, with a special focus on ACE2 variants located in the binding site to SARS-CoV-2 spike protein.The analysis of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 expressions in healthy tissues showed a higher expression in the age class 20 to 59 years (false discovery rate [FDR] < 0.0001) regardless of gender. ACE2 and TMPRSS2 were more expressed in tumors from males than females (both FDR < 0.0001) and, opposite to the regulation in tissues from healthy individuals, more expressed in elderly patients (FDR = 0.005; FDR < 0.0001, respectively).

523106,Stress and anxiety among dental practitioners during the COVID-19 pandemic: A cross-sectional survey,2021,"BACKGROUND: With the growing stress on hospitals caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, the need for home-based solutions has become a necessity to support these overwhelmed hospitals. OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study was to compare two nonpharmacological respiratory treatment methods for home-isolated COVID-19 patients using a newly developed telemanagement health care system. METHODS: In this single-blinded randomized clinical trial, 60 patients with stage 1 pneumonia caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection were treated. Group A (n=30) received oxygen therapy with bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPAP) ventilation, and Group B (n=30) received osteopathic manipulative respiratory and physical therapy techniques. Arterial blood gases of PaO2 and PaCO2, pH, vital signs (ie, temperature, respiratory rate, oxygen saturation, heart rate, and blood pressure), and chest computed tomography scans were used for follow-up and for assessment of the course and duration of recovery. RESULTS: Analysis of the results showed a significant difference between the two groups (P<.05), with Group A showing shorter recovery periods than Group B (mean 14.9, SD 1.7 days, and mean 23.9, SD 2.3 days, respectively). Significant differences were also observed between baseline and final readings in all of the outcome measures in both groups (P<.05). Regarding posttreatment satisfaction with our proposed telemanagement health care system, positive responses were given by most of the patients in both groups. CONCLUSIONS: It was found that home-based oxygen therapy with BiPAP can be a more effective prophylactic treatment approach than osteopathic manipulative respiratory and physical therapy techniques, as it can impede exacerbation of early-stage COVID-19 pneumonia. Telemanagement health care systems are promising methods to help in the pandemic-related shortage of hospital beds, as they showed reasonable effectiveness and reliability in the monitoring and management of patients with early-stage COVID-19 pneumonia.

And this unanticipated transition of medical education without any pre build infrastructure has made this altered prospect more challenging in Bangladesh. Though many countries across the world utilize web based learning along with traditional approach, but medical students of Bangladesh are mostly unfamiliar and unaccustomed with this newly imposed online learning avenue. Therefore, this study has evaluated the familiarity, usage, attitude of students towards online class and figured out the barriers witnessed by students in web based learning in Bangladesh prospect. Methods: This cross sectional, questionnaire based study was conducted in medical colleges across Bangladesh. A questionnaire linked to google form were distributed to undergraduate medical students all over Bangladesh through different social platforms. Students who showed interest, filled up the questionnaire with consent and submitted voluntarily. Those answered questionnaires were automatically stored in Google drive in a specific email ID. After completion of data collection, all data were transferred in a spread sheet and statistical analysis was done. Results: A total of 1709 students participated in this study willingly from around Bangladesh. Among the respondents 45.1% were satisfied with online class. Though most of the students (45.8%) think online class in medical education is not effective like traditional lectures but many of them (47.4%) agrees to the point that online class should have complementary role in medical education. One of the strong attitude of medical students regarding web based learning revealed in this study that, most of them undoubtedly in unison (49.5% disagree, 30.3% strongly disagree) with that web based learning can never replace traditional lecture class in medical education. 77.2% students responded that web based learning is interactive. 54.9% students pointed out that they experienced interrupted internet connections with low internet speed during class time which is a barrier to WBL. 83.2% of the respondents complained about facing audio visual problem during online class which is attributed to the poor network connectivity. Most students in Bangladesh (74.8%) found online classes costly and 53.8% of the students needed technical supports for continued online class. Conclusion: This study finding can suggest a potential reform for medical education system of Bangladesh addressing the obstacles and expectations of students which can execute a fruitful web based learning in Bangladesh.","Jeenia, F.

While these devices carry potential as educational learning tools, there is still much to learn about how to successfully integrate them into classrooms and into children’s lives. One important area to consider is the interplay of home and school contexts around children’s device use for early learning. This focus group study sought to investigate caregivers’ thoughts and perceptions of their kindergarteners’ classroom-based tablet use. Participant responses revealed the complexities and nuanced challenges of navigating their children’s device use both at home and in school. Caregivers conveyed a variety of perceived benefits, but also concerns and fears related to their children’s device use. They expressed sentiments of trust in their children’s teachers and schools, and they were eager to be shared partners who supported their children’s technology use for early learning. However, they also expressed frustration at a lack of communication around school technology use, which they perceived as an obstacle to this partnership. Findings are discussed in terms of theory advancement as well as practical implications for caregivers, teachers, and school administrators.","Donohue, Tracy H.; Aladé, Fashina",Early Child Educ J,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10643-021-01256-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34493915/,193

Once the pandemic ensued, many faculty continued to use the method as a way to infuse elements of active learning remotely. The results of a survey taken by 600 faculty reveal how they accomplished this feat. Respondents to the survey found that the case method readily transferred to online learning. Most used a mixture of synchronous and asynchronous classrooms. Serious challenges were encountered, primarily due to the difficulty instructors had in keeping track of learner participation. Many obstacles were overcome by creative strategies such as using Google Forms. Some semblance of a normal classroom was achieved by using online conferencing tools and using small groups in synchronous breakout rooms. Cases were commonly broken into chunks and spread over several days. This worked especially well with cases that were already structured this way, including interrupted cases and problem-based learning exercises. Assessment of student performance largely followed the traditional path of exams, projects, and essays, although a third of the faculty attempted to evaluate participation. Classes conducted via an asynchronous approach were largely lecture based, with cases given to learners to complete as homework either individually or as groups. The greatest challenge in this setting was that answers to case questions were often readily available to learners on the internet. This was avoided by faculty modifying questions or creating their own.","Herreid, Clyde Freeman; Prud'homme-Généreux, Annie; Wright, Carolyn; Schiller, Nancy; Herreid, Ky F",Adv Physiol Educ,https://doi.org/10.1152/advan.00046.2021; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34379482/,193

This study aimed to describe the COVID-19 vaccination intention among three different occupational risk groups and identify influencing factors of vaccination intention since a COVID-19 vaccine is available in China. A cross-sectional questionnaire survey was conducted from January 10 to February 5, 2021 in Hangzhou city of Zhejiang Province, an eastern coastal province in China. The intention to accept COVID-19 vaccination and health beliefs based on the Health Belief Model were collected. Of the participants, college students reported the lowest COVID-19 vaccination intention (64.6%), followed by public transportation workers (72.4%) and health care workers (79.9%). Perceived barriers were identified as negative factors of vaccination intention among all three occupational groups. For college students and public transportation workers, perceived benefits and cues to action were identified as protective factors, and cues to action had a positive effect on vaccination intention of health care workers. Tailored interventions are encouraged to reduce barriers of vaccination, improve health beliefs and promote COVID-19 vaccination intentions.","Jiang, Tianyu; Zhou, Xudong; Wang, Hanqian; Dong, Shixin; Wang, Menmen; Akezhuoli, Hailati; Zhu, Hui",Hum Vaccin Immunother,https://doi.org/10.1080/21645515.2021.1930473; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34289316/,193

The infant was tested for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) at 24 hours of life by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing due to the absence of prenatal maternal COVID-19 testing and was found to be positive for SARS-CoV-2 at that time. A second RT-PCR test was obtained on the infant on day of life (DOL) 4 and was also positive, confirming an accurate diagnosis of COVID-19 disease in the infant. Both the mother and father remained asymptomatic and concomitantly tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 on two separate occasions. The infant subsequently clinically improved and was discharged without any complications. This case raises the potential concern for two unreported newborn issues related to COVID-19. First, the potential unreliability of negative maternal COVID-19 testing surrounding the time of delivery as it relates to routine newborn testing and isolation needs, and second, if the negative material testing was accurate, this raises the concern for a potential case of nosocomial COVID-19 infection within the first 24 hours of life.","Harding, Benjamin R.; Vora, Farha",AJP Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34150353/; https://doi.org/10.1055/s-0041-1728783,193
597166,Should COVID-19 Vaccination Be Required for Health Care Workers?,2021,"Protein glycosylation that mediates interactions among viral proteins, host receptors, and immune molecules is an important consideration for predicting viral antigenicity. Viral spike proteins, the proteins responsible for host cell invasion, are especially important to be examined. However, there is a lack of consensus within the field of glycoproteomics regarding identification strategy and false discovery rate (FDR) calculation that impedes our examinations. As a case study in the overlap between software, here as a case study, we examine recently published SARS-CoV-2 glycoprotein datasets with four glycoproteomics identification software with their recommended protocols: GlycReSoft, Byonic, pGlyco2, and MSFragger-Glyco. These software use different Target-Decoy Analysis (TDA) forms to estimate FDR and have different database-oriented search methods with varying degrees of quantification capabilities. Instead of an ideal overlap between software, we observed different sets of identifications with the intersection. When clustering by glycopeptide identifications, we see higher degrees of relatedness within software than within glycosites. Taking the consensus between results yields a conservative and non-informative conclusion as we lose identifications in the desire for caution; these non-consensus identifications are often lower abundance and, therefore, more susceptible to nuanced changes. We conclude that present glycoproteomics softwares are not directly comparable, and that methods are needed to assess their overall results and FDR estimation performance. Once such tools are developed, it will be possible to improve FDR methods and quantify complex glycoproteomes with acceptable confidence, rather than potentially misleading broad strokes.","Hackett, William E.; Zaia, Joseph",Molecules,https://doi.org/10.3390/molecules26164757; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34443345/,193

We found that DI/II inhibited GTV JS804 infection in BHK-21 cells in a dose-dependent manner, and this inhibition activity was achieved by binding to cell membrane specifically. Moreover, JS804 treated with DI/II specific anti-serum decreased its infectivity to BHK-21 cells. Taken together, this is first to show that the purified DI/II domain of tembusu virus expressed in E. coli was able to interfere with virus infection, which opens an avenue to develop novel anti-viral regents to prevent and eventually eradicate GTV infection.","Zhao, Dongmin; Huang, Xinmei; Liu, Yuzhuo; Han, Kaikai; Zhang, Jingfeng; Yang, Jing; Xie, Xingxing; Li, Yin",Research in Veterinary Science,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S003452881400304X; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S003452881400304X; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25481678/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rvsc.2014.11.003,193

However, information from United States cohorts is limited. Understanding predictors of admission and critical illness in these patients is essential to guide prevention and risk stratification strategies. METHODS: This was a retrospective, registry‐based cohort study including all patients presenting to Rush University Medical Center in Chicago, Illinois with COVID‐19 from March 4(th), 2020 to June 21(st), 2020. Demographic, clinical, laboratory, and treatment data were obtained from the registry and compared between hospitalized and non‐hospitalized patients, as well as those with critical illness. We used logistic regression modeling to explore risk factors associated with hospitalization and critical illness. RESULTS: 8,673 COVID‐19 patients were included in the study, of whom 1,483 (17.1%) were admitted to the hospital and 528 (6.1%) were admitted to the intensive care unit.

We evaluated a pragmatic, electronic health record (EHR)-based approach toward the clinical assessment of a novel outcome measure: ICU ARDS resolution. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective observational cohort study evaluating adult patients with moderate–severe ARDS admitted to the medical intensive care unit (ICU) at Mayo Clinic in Rochester, MN, from January 2001 through December 2010. We compared the association of ICU ARDS resolution vs non-resolution with mortality. ICU ARDS resolution was defined as improvement in P/F > 200 for at least 48 h or (if arterial blood gas unavailable) SpO(2):FiO(2) (S/F) > 235, or discharge prior to 48 h from first P/F > 200 without subsequent decline in P/F, as documented in EHR. RESULTS: Of the 254 patients included, ICU ARDS resolution was achieved in 179 (70%). Hospital mortality was lower in patients who met ICU ARDS resolution criteria as compared to those who did not (23% vs. 41%, p < 0.01). After adjusting for age, gender, and illness severity, the patients who met ICU ARDS resolution criteria had lower odds of hospital mortality [odds ratio 0.47, 95% CI 0.25–0.86; p = 0.015].

We describe a large case series of bronchoscopy in mechanically ventilated (MV) COVID-19 patients outlining the procedural, clinical, utilitarian and safety aspects. Methods: Bedside bronchoscopy was performed in suspected or confirmed COVID-19 cases on MV; only positive cases were included in the study. Demographic, clinical, bronchoscopic and laboratory findings were noted and analysed. Results: 98 procedures were performed on 61 patients, mean age of 62.1 years, 51 (83.6%) males. 42 patients (69%) had at least 1 co-morbidity. Major indications for bronchoscopy were new radiographic infiltrates with clinical deterioration, increased endotracheal tube (ETT) secretions and haemorrhagic secretions/hemoptysis. Common findings were copious secretions in 87 (88.8%), purulent in 61%, mucoid in 18%, haemorrhagic in 7% and frothy in 14% cases. Morphologically, hyperaemic airways were seen in 85 (86.7%) cases, ranging from mild (61%) to moderate-severe (39%). On the management front, antibiotics were changed in 31 (31.6%) cases based on bronchoscopic findings. Other significant changes included reduction or stopping of steroids and anticoagulation, fluid, and diuretic adjustment and ETT repositioning. The incidence of bacterial superinfection was also high (54% culture positivity for various bacteria), a significant number (94%) with multi-drug resistant organisms. Fungi were seen in 7 cases (7.1%). Pneumocystis jiroveci was not seen and cytology did not show any viral inclusions. Therapeutic mucus plug removal was done in 30 cases (30.6%), and hemoptysis control in 4% cases. The procedures were safe with no complications, and none of the HCW developed any COVID19 infection. Conclusion: Bronchoscopy in critically ill MV COVID-19 patients contributes on both diagnostic and therapeutic fronts and can significantly influence management decisions. With adequate precautions and standard protocols, it is safe for both HCW and patients.","Mehta, R.

599802,The Association of COVID-19 Pandemic Stress With Health-Related Quality of Life in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia: A Cross-Sectional Analytical Study,2021-03-05,"BACKGROUND: Understanding the influences on healthcare professionals’ career choices and progression can inform interventions to improve workforce retention. Retention of health professionals is a high priority worldwide, in order to maintain expertise and meet the needs of national populations. In the UK, investment in clinical scientists’ pre-registration education is high and the need to retain motivated scientists recognised. METHODS: We conducted a mixed methods study to investigate the career choices and progression of early career clinical scientists. First job sector and salary of trainees who completed the UK pre-registration Scientist Training Programme (STP) between 2014 and 2019 were analysed using descriptive statistics and Chi-Squared tests. Semi-structured interviews conducted with volunteer practising clinical scientists who completed the programme in 2015 or 2016 were analysed thematically and reviewed for alignment with theories for understanding career choice and workforce retention. RESULTS: Most scientists who completed the STP between 2014 and 2019 obtained a post in the UK National Health Service (NHS) and achieved the expected starting salary. Life scientists were more likely to work in non-NHS healthcare settings than other scientific divisions; and physiological scientists less likely to achieve the expected starting salary. Experiences during training influenced career choice and progression 0–3 years post qualification, as did level of integration of training places with workforce planning. Specialty norms, staff turnover, organisational uncertainty and geographical preferences influenced choices in both the short (0–3 years) and longer term (5 + years). Interviewees reported a strong commitment to public service; and some could foresee that these priorities would influence future decisions about applying for management positions. These factors aligned with the components of job embeddedness theory, particularly that of ‘fit’. CONCLUSIONS: Training experiences, personal values, specialty norms and organisational factors all influence UK clinical scientists’ early career choices and progression. Job embeddedness theory provides a useful lens through which to explore career choice and progression; and suggests types of intervention that can enhance the careers of this essential group. Interventions need to take account of variations between different scientific specialties.

599892,Revolution in UK General Practice Due to COVID-19 Pandemic: A Cross-Sectional Survey,2020-08-05,"BACKGROUND: Olfactory dysfunction is an early and sensitive marker of COVID-19 infection. Although self-limiting in the majority of cases, when hyposmia or anosmia persists it can have a profound effect on quality of life. Little guidance exists on the treatment of post-COVID-19 olfactory dysfunction, however several strategies have been proposed from the evidence relating to the treatment of post-viral anosmia (such as medication or olfactory training). OBJECTIVES: To assess the effects (benefits and harms) of interventions that have been used, or proposed, to treat persisting olfactory dysfunction due to COVID-19 infection. A secondary objective is to keep the evidence up-to-date, using a living systematic review approach. SEARCH METHODS: The Cochrane ENT Information Specialist searched the Cochrane COVID-19 Study Register; Cochrane ENT Register; CENTRAL; Ovid MEDLINE; Ovid Embase; Web of Science; ClinicalTrials.gov; ICTRP and additional sources for published and unpublished studies. The date of the search was 16 December 2020. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials including participants who had symptoms of olfactory disturbance following COVID-19 infection. Only individuals who had symptoms for at least four weeks were included in this review. Studies compared any intervention with no treatment or placebo. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We used standard Cochrane methodological procedures. Primary outcomes were the recovery of sense of smell, disease-related quality of life and serious adverse effects. Secondary outcomes were the change in sense of smell, general quality of life, prevalence of parosmia and other adverse effects (including nosebleeds/bloody discharge). We used GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence for each outcome. MAIN RESULTS: We included one study with 18 participants, which compared the use of a 15-day course of oral steroids combined with nasal irrigation (consisting of an intranasal steroid/mucolytic/decongestant solution) with no intervention. Psychophysical testing was used to assess olfactory function at baseline, 20 and 40 days. Systemic corticosteroids plus intranasal steroid/mucolytic/decongestant compared to no intervention Recovery of sense of smell was assessed after 40 days (25 days after cessation of treatment) using the Connecticut Chemosensory Clinical Research Center (CCCRC) score. This tool has a range of 0 to 100, and a score of &#8805; 90 represents normal olfactory function. The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of this intervention on recovery of the sense of smell at one to three months (5/9 participants in the intervention group scored &#8805; 90 compared to 0/9 in the control group; risk ratio (RR) 11.00, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.70 to 173.66; 1 study; 18 participants; very low-certainty evidence). Change in sense of smell was assessed using the CCCRC score at 40 days. This study reported an improvement in sense of smell in the intervention group from baseline (median improvement in CCCRC score 60, interquartile range (IQR) 40) compared to the control group (median improvement in CCCRC score 30, IQR 25) (1 study; 18 participants; very low-certainty evidence). Serious adverse events andother adverse events were not identified in any participants of this study; however, it is unclear how these outcomes were assessed and recorded (1 study; 18 participants; very low-certainty evidence). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: There is very limited evidence available on the efficacy and harms of treatments for persistent olfactory dysfunction following COVID-19 infection. However, we have identified other ongoing trials in this area. As this is a living systematic review we will update the data regularly, as new results become available. For this (first) version of the living review we identified only one study with a small sample size, which assessed systemic steroids and nasal irrigation (intranasal steroid/mucolytic/decongestant). However, the evidence regarding the benefits and harms from this intervention to treat persistent post-COVID-19 olfactory dysfunction is very uncertain.","O039,; Byrne, Lisa; Webster, Katie E; MacKeith, Samuel; Philpott, Carl; Hopkins, Claire; Burton, Martin J",Cochrane Database Syst Rev,https://doi.org/10.1002/14651858.cd013876.pub2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34291813/,193

We analysed contact tracing data of 1147 COVID-19 positive cases (mean age 34.91 years, 61.99% aged 11–40, 742 males), anonymised and made public by the Karnataka government. Software tools, Cytoscape and Gephi, were used to create SNA graphics and determine network attributes of nodes (cases) and edges (directed links from source to target patients). Outdegree was 1–47 for 199 (17.35%) nodes, and betweenness, 0.5–87 for 89 (7.76%) nodes. Men had higher mean outdegree and women, higher mean betweenness. Delhi was the exogenous source of 17.44% cases. Bangalore city had the highest caseload in the state (229, 20%), but comparatively low cluster formation. Thirty-four (2.96%) ‘super-spreaders’ (outdegree ⩾ 5) caused 60% of the transmissions. Real-time social network visualisation can allow healthcare administrators to flag evolving hotspots and pinpoint key actors in transmission. Prioritising these areas and individuals for rigorous containment could help minimise resource outlay and potentially achieve a significant reduction in COVID-19 transmission.","Saraswathi, S.; Mukhopadhyay, A.; Shah, H.; Ranganath, T.

Recent scientific evidences have suggested that the main protease (M(pro)) enzyme in SARS-CoV-2 can be an ideal drug target due to its crucial role in the viral replication and transcription processes. Therefore, there are ongoing research efforts to identify drug candidates against SARS-CoV-2 M(pro) that resulted in hundreds of X-ray crystal structures of ligand-bound M(pro) complexes in the Protein Data Bank (PDB) describing the interactions of different fragment chemotypes within different sites of the M(pro). In this work, we performed rigorous molecular dynamics (MD) simulation of 62 reversible ligand–M(pro) complexes in the PDB to gain mechanistic insights about their interactions at the atomic level. Using a total of over 3 µs long MD trajectories, we characterized different pockets in the apo M(pro) structure, and analyzed the dynamic interactions and binding affinity of ligands within those pockets. Our results identified the key residues that stabilize the ligands in the catalytic sites and other pockets of M(pro). Our analyses unraveled the role of a lateral pocket in the catalytic site in M(pro) that is critical for enhancing the ligand binding to the enzyme. We also highlighted the important contribution from HIS163 in the lateral pocket towards ligand binding and affinity against M(pro) through computational mutation analyses. Further, we revealed the effects of explicit water molecules and M(pro) dimerization in the ligand association with the target. Thus, comprehensive molecular-level insights gained from this work can be useful to identify or design potent small molecule inhibitors against SARS-CoV-2 M(pro).","Weng, Ying Li; Naik, Shiv Rakesh; Dingelstad, Nadia; Lugo, Miguel R.; Kalyaanamoorthy, Subha; Ganesan, Aravindhan",Sci Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33795718/; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-86471-0,193

The interactions that occur when the respiratory epithelium encounters these viral and bacterial pathogens are poorly understood. We used Agilent bovine gene microarray chips containing 44,000 transcripts to elucidate bovine bronchial epithelial cell (BBEC) responses following in vitro exposure to BHV-1 alone, M. haemolytica alone, or both BHV-1 and M. haemolytica. Microarray analysis revealed differential regulation (>2-fold) of 978 transcripts by BHV-1 alone, 2040 transcripts by M. haemolytica alone, and 2189 genes by BHV-1 and M. haemolytica in combination. M. haemolytica treatment produced significantly greater inductions (>10-fold) of several inflammation associated genes, such as CXCL2, IL-6, IL-1α, e-selectin, and IL-8, than to BHV-1 alone. Functional analysis of the microarray data revealed a significant upregulation of genes involved in important biological processes such as inflammation (TNF-α, IL-8, Tlr-2, IL-1, CXCL2, CSF2), vascular functions (VEGF, EDN2) and leukocyte migration (ICAM1, IL-16) during a co-infection with BHV-1 and M. haemolytica compared to either pathogen alone. This study provides evidence to support that lung epithelial cells are a source of mediators that may promote inflammatory changes observed during bovine respiratory disease.","N’jai, Alhaji U.; Rivera, Jose; Atapattu, Dhammika N.; Owusu-Ofori, Kwadwo; Czuprynski, Charles J.",Vet Immunol Immunopathol,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165242713001931; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vetimm.2013.06.012; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23890750/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0165242713001931,193

The aim of this study was to quantify the impact of periodontal disease on hospital admission and mortality during the COVID-19 pandemic. Materials and Methods: The study extracted UK Biobank participants who had taken a COVID-19 test between March and June 2020 (n = 13,253), of which 1,616 were COVID-19 positive (12%) and 11,637 were COVID-19 negative (88%). Self-reported oral health indicators of painful or bleeding gums and loose teeth were used as surrogates for periodontal disease, participants who did not report any of the aforementioned indicators were used as controls. Multivariable logistic regressions were used to obtain crude and adjusted odds ratios of COVID-19 infection, subsequent hospital admission and mortality adjusted for demographics, BMI, biomarkers, lifestyle and co-morbidities. Results: Painful gums, bleeding gums and loose teeth were reported in 2.7, 11.2 and 3.3% of participants with COVID-19 infection, respectively. Risk of COVID-19 infection in participants with painful or bleeding gums and loose teeth compared to controls was not increased (odds ratio [OR]: 1.10, 95% CI: 0.72–1.69; OR: 1.15, 95% CI: 0.84–1.59). COVID-19 positive participants with painful or bleeding gums had a higher risk of mortality (OR: 1.71, 95% CI: 1.05–2.72) but not hospital admission (OR: 0.90, 95% CI: 0.59–1.37). Participants with loose teeth did not show higher risk of hospital admission or mortality compared to the control group (OR = 1.55, 95% CI: 0.87–2.77; OR: 1.85; 95% CI: 0.92–2.72). Conclusion: There was insufficient evidence to link periodontal disease with an increased risk of COVID-19 infection. However, amongst the COVID-19 positive, there was significantly higher mortality for participants with periodontal disease. Utilization of linked dental and hospital patient records would improve the understanding of the impact of periodontal disease on COVID-19 related outcomes.","Larvin, Harriet; Wilmott, Sheryl; Wu, Jianhua; Kang, Jing",Front Med (Lausanne),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33330570/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fmed.2020.604980,193

In March 2020, the World Health Organization determined that the COVID–19 outbreak is a global pandemic. The urgency and magnitude of this pandemic demanded immediate action and coordination between local, regional, national, and international actors. In that mission, researchers require access to high-quality biological materials and data from SARS-CoV-2 infected and uninfected patients, covering the spectrum of disease manifestations. The “Biobanque québécoise de la COVID-19” (BQC19) is a pan–provincial initiative undertaken in Québec, Canada to enable the collection, storage and sharing of samples and data related to the COVID-19 crisis. As a disease-oriented biobank based on high-quality biosamples and clinical data of hospitalized and non-hospitalized SARS-CoV-2 PCR positive and negative individuals. The BQC19 follows a legal and ethical management framework approved by local health authorities. The biosamples include plasma, serum, peripheral blood mononuclear cells and DNA and RNA isolated from whole blood. In addition to the clinical variables, BQC19 will provide in-depth analytical data derived from the biosamples including whole genome and transcriptome sequencing, proteome and metabolome analyses, multiplex measurements of key circulating markers as well as anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody responses. BQC19 will provide the scientific and medical communities access to data and samples to better understand, manage and ultimately limit, the impact of COVID-19. In this paper we present BQC19, describe the process according to which it is governed and organized, and address opportunities for future research collaborations.

The author uses her experience of providing mental health supports to humanitarian aid workers and the pieces of training conducted for internal medicine practitioners to offer guidance on how to manage severe job-related stresses during the response to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. This work reminds responders about their professional mission and purpose, but its extreme physical and mental demands can take a toll on their well-being and health. In CEs, the sheer volume of work and the emotional over-engagement tend to produce toxic fantasies (eg, rescuer or helper fantasies), acting upon which threatens integrity of care and increases risks for both patients and providers. Accumulated fatigue and exposure to mass suffering and mortality can change the perceived value of life and increase reckless, risk-taking, and suicidal behaviors. Introducing a self-awareness framework prioritizes the awareness of the available choices and making situation-appropriate and informed decisions about balancing one’s own and others’ needs. The COVID-19 response has demonstrated that fostering peer supports, changing organizational culture, addressing self-awareness within a training and supervisory context, and strengthening supports for managers are important parts of disaster preparedness. It also revealed that more research is needed to better understand and meet the special psychological needs of health-care responders.","Cherepanov, Elena",Disaster medicine and public health preparedness,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32907680/; https://doi.org/10.1017/dmp.2020.356,193

SARS-CoV-2 binds angiotensin I converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) of renin-angiotensin system (RAS) and causes prevalent hypokalemia METHODS: The patients with COVID-19 were classified into severe hypokalemia, hypokalemia, and normokalemia group. The study aimed to determine the relationship between hypokalemia and clinical features, the underlying causes and clinical implications of hypokalemia. RESULTS: By Feb 15, 2020, 175 patients with COVID-19 (92 women and 83 men; median age, 46 [IQR, 34-54] years) were admitted to hospital in Wenzhou, China, consisting 39 severe hypokalemia-, 69 hypokalemia-, and 67 normokalemia patients. Gastrointestinal symptoms were not associated with hypokalemia among 108 hypokalemia patients (P>0.05). Body temperature, CK, CK-MB, LDH, and CRP were significantly associated with the severity of hypokalemia (P<0.01). 93% of severe and critically ill patients had hypokalemia which was most common among elevated CK, CK-MB, LDH, and CRP. Urine K+ loss was the primary cause of hypokalemia. severe hypokalemia patients was given 3 g/day, adding up to an average of 34 (SD=4) g potassium during hospital stay. The exciting finding was that patients responded well to K+ supplements when they were inclined to recovery. CONCLUSIONS: Hypokalemia is prevailing in patients with COVID-19. The correction of hypokalemia is challenging because of continuous renal K+ loss resulting from the degradation of ACE2. The end of urine K+ loss indicates a good prognosis and may be a reliable, in-time, and sensitive biomarker directly reflecting the end of adverse effect on RAS system.","chen, dong; Li, Xiaokuni; song, qifa; Hu, Chenchan; Su, Feifei; Dai, Jianyi",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.27.20028530,193

The global pandemic COVID‐19 has raised the electric energy reliability risk due to potential workforce disruptions, supply chain interruptions, and increased possible cybersecurity threats. Additionally, the pandemic introduces a significant degree of uncertainty to the grid operation in the presence of other challenges including aging power grids, high proliferation of distributed generation, market mechanism, and active distribution network. This situation increases the need for measures for the resiliency of power grids to mitigate the impact of the pandemic as well as simultaneous extreme events including cyberattacks and adverse weather events. Solutions to manage such an adverse scenario will be multi‐fold: (a) emergency planning and organisational support, (b) following safety protocol, (c) utilising enhanced automation and sensing for situational awareness, and (d) integration of advanced technologies and data points for ML‐driven enhanced decision support. Enhanced digitalisation and automation resulted in better network visibility at various levels, including generation, transmission, and distribution. These data or information can be employed to take advantage of advanced machine learning techniques for automation and increased power grid resilience. In this paper, the resilience of power grids in the face of pandemics is explored and various machine learning tools that can be helpful to augment human operators are discused by: (a) reviewing the impact of COVID‐19 on power grid operations and actions taken by operators/organisations to minimise the impact of COVID‐19, and (b) presenting recently developed tools and concepts of machine learning and artificial intelligence that can be applied to increase the resiliency of power systems in normal and extreme scenarios such as the COVID‐19 pandemic.","Noorazar, H.; Srivastava, A.; Pannala, S.; K Sadanandan, Sajan",J Eng (Stevenage),https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.01746v3.pdf; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34540233/; https://doi.org/10.1049/tje2.12065,193

606722,Association between mental health trajectories and somatic symptoms following a second lockdown in Israel: a longitudinal study,2021-09-02,"The concept of trained immunity has recently emerged as a mechanism contributing to several immune mediated inflammatory conditions. Trained immunity is defined by the immunological memory developed in innate immune cells after a primary non-specific stimulus that, in turn, promotes a heightened inflammatory response upon a secondary challenge. The most characteristic changes associated to this process involve the rewiring of cell metabolism and epigenetic reprogramming. Under physiological conditions, the role of trained immune cells ensures a prompt response. This action is limited by effective resolution of inflammation and tissue repair in order to restore homeostasis. However, unrestrained activation of innate immune cells contributes to the development of chronic inflammation and tissue destruction through the secretion of inflammatory cytokines, proteases and growth factors. Therefore, interventions aimed at reversing the changes induced by trained immunity provide potential therapeutic approaches to treat inflammatory and autoimmune diseases like rheumatoid arthritis (RA). We review cellular approaches that target metabolism and the epigenetic reprogramming of dendritic cells, macrophages, natural killer cells, and other trained cells in the context of autoimmune inflammatory diseases.","Municio, Cristina; Criado, Gabriel",Front Immunol,https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2020.631743; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33569065/,193

The COVID-19 pandemic has caused significant patient care challenges, however simultaneously it has resulted in the interruption of clinical training and cessation of all elective work. Our primary aim was to assess the impact of the pandemic on the experiences of O&G trainees. METHODS: An email invite was sent to all 127 O&G trainees in Kent, Surrey and Sussex (KSS), inviting them to participate in an anonymous 33-question survey. The survey data was collected and analysed over a 4-week period. RESULTS: Of the 127 trainees sent the survey, 87 responded (69%). 39% and 75% of trainees agreed that the pandemic had a negative impact on their overall physical and mental wellbeing respectively. 43% agreed that the COVID-19 pandemic had adversely affected their obstetric training experience whilst almost all trainees stated a significant negative impact on benign gynaecology surgical training. Reassuringly, over 80% were positive they would recover from the negative impacts of COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: It is evident that COVID-19 has impacted O&G trainees in several ways. Whilst we face uncertain times, we must firstly ensure the physical and mental well-being of all trainees. It is encouraging that non-emergency consultations and benign surgery are being restarted nationwide and whilst this will inevitably help with re-booting surgical training, we must also think “outside” the box and utilise other modes of teaching and training to safeguard learning whilst mitigating against the negative impacts of subsequent waves.","Mallick, R; Odejinmi, F; Sideris, M; Egbase, E; Kaler, M","Facts, views & vision in ObGyn",https://doi.org/10.52054/fvvo.13.1.004; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33889856/,193

As this is a new emerging chaotic situation, already existing drugs have been suggested to ameliorate the infection of SARS-CoV-2. The consumption of caffeine has been suggested primarily because it improves exercise performance, reduces fatigue, and increases wakefulness and awareness. Caffeine has been proven to be an effective anti-inflammatory and immunomodulator. In airway smooth muscle, it has bronchodilator effects mainly due to its activity as a phosphodiesterase inhibitor and adenosine receptor antagonist. In addition, a recent published document has suggested the potential antiviral activity of this drug using in silico molecular dynamics and molecular docking; in this regard, caffeine might block the viral entrance into host cells by inhibiting the formation of a receptor-binding domain and the angiotensin-converting enzyme complex and, additionally, might reduce viral replication by the inhibition of the activity of 3-chymotrypsin-like proteases. Here, we discuss how caffeine through certain mechanisms of action could be beneficial in SARS-CoV-2.

INTERVENTION(S): No interventions administered. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Change in fertility preference RESULT(S): Approximately 1 in 3 participants reported changing their fertility preferences because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Of those that reported changing their fertility preferences, 23.9% reported TTC earlier and 61.6% reported TTC later. Preliminary findings show the odds of changing fertility preferences in black or African American women were 5.45 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.50–19.90) times that of white women and in nonheterosexual women were 2.76 (95% CI, 1.41–5.42) times that of heterosexual women. Furthermore, every 1 unit increase in state anxiety and depressive symptoms was associated with a 26% (95% CI, 3%–54%) or 17% (95% CI, 5%–31%) increase in odds of pushing back TTC, respectively. CONCLUSION(S): This exploratory study highlights how the fertility preferences of racial and ethnic minorities, sexual minorities, and those experiencing mental health issues may be disparately influenced by the pandemic. Research is needed to examine further the disparate effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on fertility preferences.","Naya, Christine H.; Saxbe, Darby E.; Dunton, Genevieve F.",Fertil Steril,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0015028221004453; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34325920/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0015028221004453; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.fertnstert.2021.05.092,193

The nasopharyngeal sampling method being often uncomfortable, nasal sampling could prove to be a viable alternative to the reference sampling method. We performed a multicentre, prospective validation study of the COVID‐VIRO® test, using a nasal swab sampling method, in a point‐of‐care setting. In addition, we performed a multicentre, prospective, and usability study to validate the use of the rapid antigen nasal diagnostic test by laypersons. In March 2021, 239 asymptomatic and symptomatic patients were included in the validation study. Compared with reverse‐transcription polymerase chain reaction on nasopharyngeal samples, the sensitivity and specificity of the COVID‐VIRO® Antigen test combined with a nasal sampling method were evaluated as 96.88% and 100%, respectively. A total of 101 individuals were included in the usability study. Among these, 99% of the participants rated the instructions material as good, 98% of the subjects executed the test procedure well, and 98% of the participants were able to correctly interpret the test results.

A Canadian Society of Otolaryngology – Head & Neck Surgery (CSO-HNS) task force was convened with multi-specialty involvement from otolaryngology-head & neck surgery, general surgery, critical care and anesthesiology to develop a set of recommendations for the performance of tracheotomies during the COVID-19 pandemic. MAIN BODY: The tracheotomy procedure is highly aerosol generating and directly exposes the entire surgical team to the viral aerosol plume and secretions, thereby increasing the risk of transmission to healthcare providers. As such, we believe extended endotracheal intubation should be the standard of care for the entire duration of ventilation in the vast majority of patients. Pre-operative COVID-19 testing is highly recommended for any non-emergent procedure. CONCLUSION: The set of recommendations in this document highlight the importance of avoiding tracheotomy procedures in patients who are COVID-19 positive if at all possible. Recommendations for appropriate PPE and environment are made for COVID-19 positive, negative and unknown patients requiring consideration of tracheotomy. The safety of healthcare professionals who care for ill patients and who keep critical infrastructure operating is paramount.","Sommer, D. D.; Engels, P. T.; USAF, Colonel E.K.

We aimed to comprehensively quantify the association between mental and neurological disorders, both pre-existing and subsequent, and the risk of susceptibility, severity and mortality of COVID-19. METHODS: In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, PsycINFO, and Cochrane library databases for studies published from the inception up to January 16, 2021 and updated at July 7, 2021. Observational studies including cohort and case-control, cross-sectional studies and case series that reported risk estimates of the association between mental or neurological disorders and COVID-19 susceptibility, illness severity and mortality were included. Two researchers independently extracted data and conducted the quality assessment. Based on I(2) heterogeneity, we used a random effects model to calculate pooled odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI). Subgroup analyses and meta-regression analysis were also performed. This study was registered on PROSPERO (registration number: CRD 42021230832). FINDING: A total of 149 studies (227,351,954 participants, 89,235,737 COVID-19 patients) were included in this analysis, in which 27 reported morbidity (132,727,798), 56 reported illness severity (83,097,968) and 115 reported mortality (88,878,662). Overall, mental and neurological disorders were associated with a significant high risk of infection (pre-existing mental: OR 1·67, 95% CI 1·12-2·49; and pre-existing neurological: 2·05, 1·58-2·67), illness severity (mental: pre-existing, 1·40, 1·25-1·57; sequelae, 4·85, 2·53-9·32; neurological: pre-existing, 1·43, 1·09-1·88; sequelae, 2·17, 1·45-3·24), and mortality (mental: pre-existing, 1·47, 1·26-1·72; neurological: pre-existing, 2·08, 1·61-2·69; sequelae, 2·03, 1·66-2·49) from COVID-19. Subgroup analysis revealed that association with illness severity was stronger among younger COVID-19 patients, and those with subsequent mental disorders, living in low- and middle-income regions. Younger patients with mental and neurological disorders were associated with higher mortality than elders. For type-specific mental disorders, susceptibility to contracting COVID-19 was associated with pre-existing mood disorders, anxiety, and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD); illness severity was associated with both pre-existing and subsequent mood disorders as well as sleep disturbance; and mortality was associated with pre-existing schizophrenia. For neurological disorders, susceptibility was associated with pre-existing dementia; both severity and mortality were associated with subsequent delirium and altered mental status; besides, mortality was associated with pre-existing and subsequent dementia and multiple specific neurological diseases. Heterogeneities were substantial across studies in most analysis. INTERPRETATION: The findings show an important role of mental and neurological disorders in the context of COVID-19 and provide clues and directions for identifying and protecting vulnerable populations in the pandemic. Early detection and intervention for neurological and mental disorders are urgently needed to control morbidity and mortality induced by the COVID-19 pandemic. However, there was substantial heterogeneity among the included studies, and the results should be interpreted with caution. More studies are needed to explore long-term mental and neurological sequela, as well as the underlying brain mechanisms for the sake of elucidating the causal pathways for these associations.

One critique of such programs focuses on the uncertainty around whether seropositivity means immunity from repeat infection. However, an additional important consideration is that the low positive predictive value of serological tests in the setting of low population seroprevalence and imperfect test specificity will lead to many false-positive ‘passport’ holders. Here, we pose a simple question: how many false-positive ‘passports’ could be issued while maintaining herd immunity in the workforce? Answering this question leads to a simple mathematical formula for the minimum requirements of serological tests for a passport program, which depend on population prevalence and the value of R(0). Our work replaces speculation in the press with rigorous analysis and will need to be considered in policy decisions that are based on individual and population serology results.","Larremore, Daniel B; Bubar, Kate M; Grad, Yonatan H",Clin Infect Dis,https://doi.org/10.1093/cid/ciaa1019; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32687149/,193

However, controlled clinical study procedures have evolved substantially since then. We performed a trial using updated methods to evaluate the efficacy of Lantigen B®, a chemical BL. This double blind, placebo controlled, multi-center clinical trial had the primary objective of assessing the capacity of Lantigen B to significantly reduce the total number of infectious episodes in patients with RRTI. Secondary aims were the RRTI duration, the frequency and the severity of the acute episodes, the use of drugs and the number of missed workdays. In the subgroup of allergic patients with RRTI, the number of allergic episodes (AE) and the use of anti-allergic drugs were also evaluated. One hundred and sixty patients, 79 allocated to the treated group (TG) and 81 to the placebo group (PG), were enrolled; 30 were lost during the study and 120 (79 females and 38 males) were evaluated. The PG had 1.43 episodes in the 8-months of follow-up while the TG had 0.86 episodes (p =0.036). A similar result was observed in the allergic patients (1.80 and 0.86 episodes for the PG and the TG, respectively, p =0.047). The use of antibiotics was reduced (mean 1.24 and 2.83 days of treatment for the TG and the PG). Logistic regression analysis indicated that the estimated risk of needing antibiotics and NSAIDs was reduced by 52.1 and 30.6%, respectively. With regard to the number of AE, no significant difference was observed between the two groups, but bronchodilators, antihistamines and local corticosteroids were reduced by 25.7%, 56.2% and 41.6%, respectively, in the TG. Lantigen B significantly reduced the number of infectious episodes in patients with RRTI. This finding suggests a first line use of this drug for the prophylaxis of infectious episodes in these patients.","Braido, Fulvio; Melioli, Giovanni; Candoli, Piero; Cavalot, Andrea; Di Gioacchino, Mario; Ferrero, Vittorio; Incorvaia, Cristoforo; Mereu, Carlo; Ridolo, Erminia; Rolla, Giovanni; Rossi, Oliviero; Savi, Eleonora; Tubino, Libero; Reggiardo, Giorgio; Baiardini, Ilaria; di Marco, Eddi; Rinaldi, Gilberto; Canonica, Giorgio Walter; Accorsi, Carlo; Bossilino, Claudia; Bonzano, Laura; DiLizia, Michela; Fedrighini, Barbara; Garelli, Valentina; Gerace, Vincenzo; Maniscalco, Sara; Massaro, Ilaria; Messi, Alessandro; Milanese, Manlio; Peveri, Silvia; Penno, Arminio; Pizzimenti, Stefano; Pozzo, Tiziana; Raie, Alberto; Regina, Sergio; Sclifò, Francesca",Immunology Letters,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165247814002521; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25445613/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.imlet.2014.10.026; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0165247814002521,193

Improved political will and better involvement of HFs management teams in infection prevention and control (IPC) systems are needed to reduce the risk for COVID-19 infection among HCWs. We recommend scale-up training on IPC measures particularly hand washing and use of PPE as well as the development of effective points of care risk assessment with a high index of suspicion in HFs.","Ilesanmi, O.

623884,Using an Extended Technology Acceptance Model to Understand the Factors Influencing Telehealth Utilization After Flattening the COVID-19 Curve in South Korea: Cross-sectional Survey Study,2021-01-08,"Abstract The wettability of a formation is defined as the tendency of one fluid to spread on a surface in competition with other fluids which are also in contact with it. However, the impact of temperature on wettability in an aquifer and the modification of relative permeability curves based on the temperature variation in aquifers is not well covered in the literature. This study redresses this dearth of information by investigating the impact of temperature on wettability distribution in a reservoir and updating the relative permeability curves based on its temperature propagation. The impact of the latter is studied in relation to the solubility of CO2 injected into an aquifer using the numerical methods (i.e. ECLIPSE). If the CO2 injected has a temperature higher than the formation geothermal temperature, it can change the wettability of the formation further to a more CO2 wet condition. This increases the risk of leakage and also changes the relative permeability curves as the CO2 moves through the reservoir, a situation that needs to be considered in reservoir simulations. The results show that updating and modifying the relative permeability curves with temperature variation in an aquifer can increase the amount of CO2 dissolution there.","Abbaszadeh, Mohsen; Shariatipour, Seyed; Ifelebuegu, Augustine",International Journal of Greenhouse Gas Control,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1750583620300669; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1750583620300669,193

Here, we functionally define the role SARS-CoV-2 spike plays as a target of the human neutralizing antibody response. In this study, we identify the spike protein subunits that contain antigenic determinants and examine the neutralization capacity of polyclonal sera from a cohort of patients that tested qRT-PCR-positive for SARS-CoV-2. Using an ELISA format, we assessed binding of human sera to spike subunit 1 (S1), spike subunit 2 (S2) and the receptor binding domain (RBD) of spike. To functionally identify the key target of neutralizing antibody, we depleted sera of subunit-specific antibodies to determine the contribution of these individual subunits to the antigen-specific neutralizing antibody response. We show that epitopes within RBD are the target of a majority of the neutralizing antibodies in the human polyclonal antibody response. These data provide critical information for vaccine development and development of sensitive and specific serological testing.","Steffen, Tara L.; Stone, E.

Studies comparing COVID-19 patients with contemporaneous controls of similar severity are lacking. Methods: 22 COVID+ and 20 COVID- patients with respiratory failure admitted to intensive care were studied longitudinally. Demographic and clinical data were obtained from the day of admission. APLA testing included anti-cardiolipin (aCL), anti-{beta}2glycoprotein 1 ({beta}2GP1), anti-domain 1 {beta}2 glycoprotein 1 ({beta}2GP1) and anti-phosphatidyl serine/prothrombin complex (PS/PT). Anti-nuclear antibodies (ANA) were detected by immunofluorescence and antibodies to cytokines by a commercially available multiplexed array. ANOVA was used for continuous variables and Fisher exact test was used for categorical variables with =0.05 and the false discovery rate at q=0.05. Results: APLA were predominantly IgG aCL (48%) followed by IgM (21%) in all patients, with a tendency toward higher frequency among the COVID+. aCL was not associated with surrogate markers of thrombosis but IgG aCL was strongly associated with worse disease severity and higher ANA titers regardless of COVID-19 status. An association between aCL and anti-cytokine autoantibodies tended to be higher among the COVID+ cohort. Conclusions: Positive APLA serology was associated with more severe disease regardless of COVID-19 status.","Trahtemberg, U.; Rottapel, R.; DosSantos, C.; Slutsky, A. S.; Baker, A. J.; Fritzler, M.

People use information technology (IT) systems to watch multimedia videos and to perform interactive functions. Moreover, IT systems enhance multimedia interactions between users. To explore user behaviors in viewing multimedia videos by key points in time, multimedia video watching patterns are analyzed by data mining techniques. Data mining methods were used to analyze users’ video watching patterns in converged IT environments. After the experiment, we recorded the processes of clicking the Web multimedia video player. The system logs of using the video player are classified into four variables, playing time, active playing time, played amount, and actively played amount. To explore the four variables, we apply the k-means clustering technique to organize the similar playing behavior patterns of the users into three categories: actively engaged users, watching engaged users, and long engaged users. Finally, we applied statistical analysis methods to compare the three categories of users’ watching behaviors.

Imaging skills, clinical knowledge as well as vascular and non-vascular interventional technical ability, are essential to practice interventional radiology effectively. Patient safety is of paramount importance in interventional radiology as in all branches of medicine. Potential failures occur throughout successful procedures and are attributed to a spectrum of errors, including equipment unavailability, planning errors, and communication errors. These are mainly preventable by improved preprocedural planning and teamwork. Of all the targeted and effective actions that can be undertaken to reduce adverse events, the use of safety checklists might have a prominent role. The advantage of a safety checklist for interventional radiology is that it guarantees that human error in terms of forgetting key steps in patient preparation, intraprocedural care, and postoperative care are not forgotten.","Pinto, Antonio; Giurazza, Francesco; Califano, Teresa; Rea, Gaetano; Valente, Tullio; Niola, Raffaella; Caranci, Ferdinando",Semin Ultrasound CT MR,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0887217120301220?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1053/j.sult.2020.09.004; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0887217120301220; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33541584/,193

This situation has had a major impact on clinical laboratories that have attempted to answer the urgent need for diagnostic tools, since the identification of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19). Development of a reliable serological diagnostic immunoassay, with high levels of sensitivity and specificity to detect SARS‐CoV‐2 antibodies with improved differential diagnosis from other circulating viruses, is mandatory. METHODS: An enzyme‐linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using whole inactivated virus cultured in vitro, was developed to detect viral antigens. WB and ELISA investigations were carried out with sera of convalescent patients and negative sera samples. Both analyses were concurrently performed with recombinant MABs to verify the findings. RESULTS: Preliminary data from 10 sera (5 patients with COVID‐19, and 5 healthy controls) using this immunoassay are very promising, successfully identifying all of the confirmed SARS‐CoV‐2‐positive individuals. CONCLUSION: This ELISA appears to be a specific and reliable method for detecting COVID‐19 antibodies (IgG, IgM, and IgA), and a useful tool for identifying individuals which have developed immunity to the virus.","Cerutti, Helena; Ricci, Veronica; Tesi, Giulia; Soldatini, Claudia; Castria, Marinunzia; Vaccaro, Marco Natale; Tornesi, Stefania; Toppi, Simona; Verdiani, Silvana; Brogi, Alessandra",J Clin Lab Anal,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33608968/; https://doi.org/10.1002/jcla.23735,193

627272,"Exercise and Physical Activity eHealth in COVID-19 Pandemic: A Cross-Sectional Study of Effects on Motivations, Behavior Change Mechanisms, and Behavior",2021-02-22,"INTRODUCTION. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Corona Virus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). The disease was first identified in December 2019 in Wuhan, the capital of China's Hubei province, and has since spread globally, resulting in the ongoing 2019–2020 corona virus pandemic. SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to the original SARS-CoV. It is thought to have a zoonotic origin. The virus is primarily spread between people during close contact, often via small droplets produced by coughing, sneezing or talking. People may also become infected by touching a contaminated surface and then touching their face. COVID-19 patients currently remain the primary source of infection. An epidemiological survey indicated that the general population is susceptible to SARS-CoV-2. The spectrum of this disease ranges from mild to life-threatening. Fever is the most common symptom, although older people and those with comorbidities may experience fever later in the disease. Other common symptoms include cough, loss of appetite, fatigue, shortness of breath, sputum production, and muscle and joint pains. Symptoms such as nausea, vomiting and diarrhea have been observed in varying percentages. Some cases might progress promptly to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and/or multiple organ function failure. Asymptomatic carriers and those in the incubation period may also be infectious. AIM. To determine the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of patients presenting with COVID-19 at the screening clinic of a tertiary care hospital in Peshawar, Pakistan. METHODOLOGY. In this descriptive study, we analysed data of patients presenting to a newly established Covid-19 screening clinic in Rehman Medical Institute. Anyone who reported with new onset fever and/or cough was tested for SARS-CoV-2 in the screening clinic. We documented and analysed demographic, epidemiological and clinical characteristics, which included age, sex, travel history, clinical features, comorbidities and laboratory data of patients confirmed by real-time reverse-transcription (RT)-PCR at Rehman Medical Institute, Peshawar, Pakistan from 15 March till 21 April 2020. Paired specimens of throat swabs and nasal swabs were obtained from 845 patients, ribonucleic acid (RNA) was extracted and tested for SARS-CoV-2 by the RT-PCR assay. RESULTS. A total of 845 specimens were taken as described above. The positive rate for SARS-CoV-2 was about 14.3%. Male and older population had a significantly higher positive rate. Of the 121 patients infected with SARS-CoV-2, the mean age was 43.19 years (sd, 17.57) and the infections were more frequent among male gender accounting for 85 (70.25 %) patients. Common symptoms included fever (88 patients, 72 %), cough (72 patients, 59.5 %) and shortness of breath (69 patients, 57 %). Twenty-two (18 %) patients had recent travel history outside Pakistan in the previous 14 days, the majority of whom had returned back from Saudi Arabia. CONCLUSION. In this single-centre, prospective, descriptive study, fever, cough and shortness of breath were the most common symptoms. Old age (>50 years), chronic underlying comorbidities and travel history may be risk factors. Therefore, we concluded that viral nucleic acid amplification tests (NAAT) played an important role in identifying SARS-CoV-2 infection in a screening clinic, which helped with isolation and cohorting of these patients.","Khan, Maria; Khan, Haris; Khan, Shehriyar; Nawaz, Maimoona",J Med Microbiol,https://doi.org/10.1099/jmm.0.001231; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32783802/,193

People in China have gradually returned to normal life; however, in the protracted pandemic, people may still follow certain dietary behaviors to cope with COVID-19. This study was the second stage of a longitudinal nutritional survey conducted in post-lockdown China that was aimed at exploring post-lockdown dietary behaviors and their effects on dietary diversity. In line with the first stage of the survey, the current dietary behaviors used to cope with COVID-19 and ways of purchasing food were determined. In addition, changes in dietary behavior compared to the same period in 2019 and those behaviors recommended to ensure food safety were also investigated. The Household Dietary Diversity Score (HDDS) was used to assess dietary diversity; this was also used in the first stage of the survey. Linear regression was used to model the associations between the HDDS, participants’ characteristics, and dietary behaviors. The data of 1994 participants were included in the analysis. The overall mean HDDS was 9.2 ± 2.0. Compared to the same period in 2019, a substantial proportion of participants self-reported that they had recently decreased eating in restaurants (61.6%) and reduced intakes of seafood (53.1%), imported frozen food (57.1%), and raw food (60.5%), while 64.8% of participants reported increased cooking at home. People with an increased consumption of seafood (adjusted OR (95%CI) = 0.56 (0.07, 1.04)) and raw food (adjusted OR (95%CI) = 0.74 (0.27, 1.21)) had a significantly higher HDDS. Participants who changed their consumption of imported frozen food (both increased and decreased) had a higher HDDS (adjusted OR (95%CI) = 0.56 (0.07, 1.04) and 0.27 (0.09, 0.44), respectively). People who depended more on purchasing food online had a significantly higher HDDS (adjusted OR (95%CI) = 0.29 (0.02, 0.55)). Compared to the data from stage 1, the proportion of people choosing healthy products to cope with COVID-19 did not greatly change and those people had a higher HDDS (adjusted OR (95%CI) = 0.31 (0.19, 0.42)). Although this study found that the proportion of people who chose to use alcohol or vinegar to prevent COVID-19 had decreased substantially compared to during lockdown, there were still 5.3% and 9.8% who followed these irrational behaviors. Regarding the dietary behavior regarding food safety, except for cooking food fully, fewer than half of participants followed the recommended dietary behaviors, including individual food servings (44.2%), using serving chopsticks and spoons (44.8%), and preparing raw and cooked food separately (43.3%). People who followed these behaviors had a better dietary diversity. In conclusion, during the post-lockdown period, people still followed certain dietary behaviors to cope with COVID-19. While some dietary behaviors were adopted to help prevent infection, irrational dietary behaviors were still followed. These behaviors were associated with the dietary diversity in Chinese adults.","Zhang, Jian; Zhao, Ai; Ke, Yalei; Huo, Shanshan; Ma, Yidi; Zhang, Yumei; Ren, Zhongxia; Li, Zhongyu; Liu, Keyang",Nutrients,https://doi.org/10.3390/nu12113269; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33114499/,193
630709,Maintaining access to HIV prep in a pandemic: Prep-user and health care professional perspectives on a telephone-based prep service,2021,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a contagious and deadly disease caused by a new coronavirus. The protein sequence of the chymotrypsin‐like cysteine proteinase (CCP) responsible for SARS viral replication has been identified as a target for developing anti‐SARS drugs. Here, I report the ATVRLQ(p1)A(p1')‐bound CCP 3D model predicted by 420 different molecular dynamics simulations (2.0 ns for each simulation with a 1.0‐fs time step). This theoretical model was released at the Protein Data Bank (PDB; code: 1P76) before the release of the first X‐ray structure of CCP (PDB code: 1Q2W). In contrast to the catalytic dyad observed in X‐ray structures of CCP and other coronavirus cysteine proteinases, a catalytic triad comprising Asp187, His41, and Cys145 is found in the theoretical model of the substrate‐bound CCP. The simulations of the CCP complex suggest that substrate binding leads to the displacement of a water molecule entrapped by Asp187 and His41, thus converting the dyad to a more efficient catalytic triad. The CCP complex structure has an expanded active‐site pocket that is useful for anti‐SARS drug design. In addition, this work demonstrates that multiple molecular dynamics simulations are effective in correcting errors that result from low‐sequence‐identity homology modeling.

630988,"Prioritization of Features for Mobile Apps for Families in a Federal Nutrition Program for Low-Income Women, Infants, and Children: User-Centered Design Approach",2021-07-30,"OBJECTIVE: In this study, we extend the impact of mindfulness to the concept of least-worst decision-making. Least-worst decisions involve high-uncertainty and require the individual to choose between a number of potentially negative courses of action. Research is increasingly exploring least-worst decisions, and real-world events (such as the COVID-19 pandemic) show the need for individuals to overcome uncertainty and commit to a least-worst course of action. From sports to business, researchers are increasingly showing that “being mindful” has a range of positive performance-related benefits. We hypothesized that mindfulness would improve least-worst decision-making because it would increase self-reflection and value identification. However, we also hypothesized that trait maximization (the tendency to attempt to choose the “best” course of action) would negatively interact with mindfulness. METHODS: Three hundred and ninety-eight participants were recruited using Amazon MTurk and exposed to a brief mindfulness intervention or a control intervention (listening to an audiobook). After this intervention, participants completed the Least-Worst Uncertain Choice Inventory for Emergency Responders (LUCIFER). RESULTS: As hypothesized, mindfulness increased decision-making speed and approach-tendencies. Conversely, for high-maximizers, increased mindfulness caused a slowing of the decision-making process and led to more avoidant choices. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows the potential positive and negative consequences of mindfulness for least-worst decision-making, emphasizing the critical importance of individual differences when considering both the effect of mindfulness and interventions aimed at improving decision-making.","Shortland, Neil D.; McGarry, Presley; Thompson, Lisa; Stevens, Catherine; Alison, Laurence J.",Front Psychol,https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.674694; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34122271/,193

632555,A Bottom-Up Approach Addressing Patient Care and Differential Diagnosis Amidst the Covid-19 Response,2020-09-22,"Arteriviruses are a family of positive-stranded RNA viruses that includes the prototypic equine arteritis virus (EAV) and porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV). Although several vaccines against these viruses are commercially available there is room for improvement, especially in the case of PRRSV. The ability of arteriviruses to counteract the immune response is thought to decrease the efficacy of the current modified live virus vaccines. We have recently shown that the deubiquitinase (DUB) activity of EAV papain-like protease 2 (PLP2) is important for the inhibition of innate immune activation during infection. A vaccine virus lacking PLP2 DUB activity may therefore be more immunogenic and provide improved protection against subsequent challenge than its DUB-competent counterpart. To test this hypothesis, twenty Shetland mares were randomly assigned to one of three groups. Two groups were vaccinated, either with DUB-positive (n = 9) or DUB-negative (n = 9) recombinant EAV. The third group (n = 2) was not vaccinated. All horses were subsequently challenged with the virulent KY84 strain of EAV. Both vaccine viruses proved to be replication competent in vivo. In addition, the DUB-negative virus provided a similar degree of protection against clinical disease as its DUB-positive parental counterpart. Owing to the already high level of protection provided by the parental virus, a possible improvement due to inactivation of PLP2 DUB activity could not be detected under these experimental conditions. Taken together, the data obtained in this study warrant further in vivo investigations into the potential of using DUB-mutant viruses for the improvement of arterivirus vaccines.","van Kasteren, Puck B.; Knaap, Robert C.M.; van den Elzen, Paul; Snijder, Eric J.; Balasuriya, Udeni B.R.; van den Born, Erwin; Kikkert, Marjolein",Vet Microbiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25975520/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vetmic.2015.04.018; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0378113515001637; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378113515001637,193

Key themes covered during the conference included: Instruments for Proficient Cancer Control in PALOP, oncology education and training in PALOP, CanScreen5—International Agency for Research on Cancer platform to improve quality in tracking cancer, International Gynecologic Cancer Society—Global Curriculum and Mentorship Programme, Oncology Training/Intervention—Support Programmes, Telepathology and Cancer: Challenges and Opportunities, Cancer Burden in PALOP region and Sub-Saharan Africa, Breast Cancer—The current situation in PALOP and The African Breast Cancer Coalition—Disparities in outcomes study in PALOP Countries (ABC-DO-PALOP) study: a proposal. It has been demonstrated that the collaboration and exchange of experiences between African countries and amongst PALOP, in particular, are crucial, whether in the organisation of population-based cancer registries, in the realization of national oncology plans, in the creation of therapeutic recommendations and in strengthening capacities in radiotherapy, amongst other important topics in oncology. The PALOP oncology school will be a fundamental training tool to be administered for better care for cancer patients.","Santos, Lúcio Lara; Miguel, Fernando; Túlsidas, Satish; Spencer, Hirondina Borges; Rodrigues, Belmira; Lopes, Lygia Vieira; Freitas, Helga",Ecancermedicalscience,https://doi.org/10.3332/ecancer.2020.1108; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33144876/,193
633265,Predicting Depressive Symptom Severity Through Individuals’ Nearby Bluetooth Device Count Data Collected by Mobile Phones: Preliminary Longitudinal Study,2021-07-30,"Background: Despite the dominance of respiratory disease, acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF) and acute decompensation (AD) have been reported in patients with COVID-19 and preexisting liver disease, in particular cirrhosis. Moreover, COVID-19 has been associated with increased mortality in patients with end-stage liver disease (ESLD). Aim our study is to evaluate the impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection in patients with ESLD listed for liver transplant (LT). Methods: Data from adults listed for LT with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection were collected from 7 LT centers across Italy. Results: From March 1st to October 31st 2020, 29 patients listed for LT were tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Twenty-one patients (72%) were male, median age was 59 years (20-71). The most common indication (70%) for LT was ESLD. The mean MELD score was 18 (8-32). At diagnosis, twenty patients (69%) presented at least one symptom: 38% fever, 28% dry cough, and 31% respiratory distress. Notably, 25% of patients presented hepatic encephalopathy as first presenting symptom. The remaining 9 patients (31%) were completely asymptomatic: nasopharyngeal swab was performed according to surveillance protocols. Twenty-one patients (70%) required hospitalization for the management of COVID-19. Respiratory support was necessary in 13 patients (45%): 5 (17%) required O2-supply, 4 (14%) non-invasive ventilation and 4 (14%) mechanical ventilation. Only five patients (17%) received at least one drug for infection treatment (see table). Heparin was administrated in 7 patients (28%). No bleeding episodes were reported. Eight (%) patients died after a median time of 6 days (2-29) from Covid-19 diagnosis, with a 30-day-mortality rate of 30%. Three patients died of liver failure, while the remaining of multiple organ failures. In the univariate analysis, factors associated with 30-days mortality were respectively presence of comorbidities (0.07), severity of liver disease according to MELD score (0.05) and severity of respiratory failure (0.011). In the cox-regression analysis, only the severity of respiratory failure was significantly associated with the mortality (HR 3.13, IC 1.53-6.3). Conclusions: COVID-19 is associated with elevated mortality in LT candidates, listed for ESLD.","Perricone, G.; Vigano, R.; Mazzarelli, C.; Travi, G.; Pasulo, L.; Invernizzi, F.; Morelli, M.

A number of scholars have called for more in-depth critical research on COVID-19 and health inequalities to produce a strong empirical evidence based on these issues. There are also justifiable concerns about the scarcity of health-equity actions oriented analyses of the situation and calls for more empirical evidence on COVID-19 and health inequalities. A preliminary condition to establish this type of information is strong capacity to conduct health inequalities research. Worldwide, however, this type of capacity is limited, which, alongside other challenges, will likely hinder capacities of many countries to develop comprehensive equity-oriented COVID-19 analyses, and adequate responses to present and future crises. The current pandemic reinforces the pending need to invest in and strengthen these research capacities. These capacities must be supported by widespread recognition and concern, cognitive social capital, and greater commitment to coordinated, transparent action, and responsibility. Otherwise, we will remain inadequately prepared to respond and meet our society’s unmet needs.","Cash-Gibson, Lucinda; Pericàs, Juan M.; Martinez-Herrera, Eliana; Benach, Joan",Int J Health Serv,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33684016/; https://doi.org/10.1177/0020731421993939,193

637531,"Behind the masks: A cross-sectional study on intolerance of uncertainty, perceived vulnerability to disease and psychological flexibility in relation to state anxiety and wellbeing during the COVID-19 pandemic",2021-09-25,"Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) infection is associated with severe morbidity and mortality in immunocompromised individuals, mainly transplant recipients and AIDS patients, and is the most frequent cause of congenital malformations in newborn children. To date, few drugs are licensed for the treatment of HCMV infections, most of which target the viral DNA polymerase and suffer from many drawbacks, including long-term toxicity, low potency, and poor bioavailability. In addition, the emergence of drug-resistant viral strains is becoming an increasing problem for disease management. Finally, none of the current anti-HCMV drugs have been approved for the treatment of congenital infections. For all these reasons, there is still a strong need for new anti-HCMV drugs with novel mechanisms of action. The first events of the virus replication cycle, including attachment, entry, immediate-early gene expression, and immediate-early functions—in particular that of Immediate-Early 2 protein—represent attractive targets for the development of novel antiviral compounds. Such inhibitors would block not only the expression of viral immediate-early proteins, which play a key role in the pathogenesis of HCMV infection, but also the host immunomodulation and the changes to cell physiology induced by the first events of virus infection. This review describes the current knowledge on the initial phases of HCMV replication, their validation as potential novel antiviral targets, and the development of compounds that block such processes.","Mercorelli, Beatrice; Lembo, David; Palù, Giorgio; Loregian, Arianna",Pharmacol Ther,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21570424/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0163725811000982; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pharmthera.2011.04.007; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0163725811000982,193

OBJECTIVE: This study examined the frequency of North Carolina (NC) EDs visits for selected injury mechanisms during the first eleven months of the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Data were obtained from the NC Disease Event Tracking and Epidemiologic Collection Tool (NC DETECT), NC's legislatively mandated statewide syndromic surveillance system for the years 2019 and 2020. Frequencies of January – November 2020 NC ED visits were compared to frequencies of 2019 visits for selected injury mechanisms, classified according to International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM) injury diagnosis and mechanism codes. RESULTS: In 2020, the total number of injury-related visits declined by 19.5% (N = 651,158) as compared to 2019 (N = 809,095). Visits related to motor vehicle traffic crashes declined by a greater percentage (29%) and falls (19%) declined by a comparable percentage to total injury-related visits. Visits related to assault (15%) and self-harm (10%) declined by smaller percentages. Medication/drug overdose visits increased (10%), the only injury mechanism studied to increase during this period. CONCLUSION: Both ED avoidance and decreased exposures may have contributed to these declines, creating implications for injury morbidity and mortality. Injury outcomes exacerbated by the pandemic should be addressed by timely public health responses.","Harmon, Katherine J.; Fliss, Mike Dolan; Marshall, Stephen W.; Peticolas, Kathy; Proescholdbell, Scott K.; Waller, Anna E.",Am J Emerg Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33892334/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajem.2021.04.019; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0735675721003004; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0735675721003004,193

The Debate Surrounding COVID-19 Health Risk Management: An Israeli Case Study,2021-06-21,"Aims To compare the risk of adverse outcomes (i.e. hospital/intensive care admission, death) in population sub-groups during two periods of the COVID-19 pandemic in the Republic of Ireland. Methods We analysed routinely-collected, publicly-available data on 67,900 people with laboratory confirmed COVID-19 infection between 29th Feb to 14th Nov 2020. This period encompassed two waves of infection and two corresponding national lockdowns. For two observational periods covering each wave (W1, W2), each ending 17-19 days before implementation of high-level national restrictions, we segmented the population based on age and underlying clinical conditions. Results The prevalence of laboratory confirmed COVID-19 was 1.4%. The risk of admission to hospital, admission to intensive care, and death was 7.2%, 0.9%, and 2.5%, respectively. Compared to younger confirmed cases, those aged [≥]65 y had increased risk of hospital admission (RR 5.61), ICU admission (RR 3.56), and death (RR 60.8). W2 was associated with more cases and fewer adverse events than W1. The risk of all adverse outcomes was reduced in W2 than in W1. Conclusions Ongoing responses should consider the variation in risk of adverse outcomes between specific sub-groups. These findings indicate the need to sustain the prevention, identification and management of noncommunicable diseases to reduce the burden of COVID-19.","Roe, M.; Wall, P.; Mallon, P.; Horgan, M.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.09.20246363v1?rss=1; https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.12.09.20246363,193

All data were obtained from the disease surveillance points system, and two proportions for assigning chronic pulmonary heart disease (PHD) as GC to IHD were from GBD2010 and GBD2013, which were different for years before 2004. By using the GBD2013 approach, the age-standard mortality rate (ASMR) increased by 100.21% in 1991, 44.81% in 1996, and 42.47% in 2000 in comparison with the GBD2010 approach. The different methods of chronic PHD redistribution impacted the trend of IHD mortality, which elevated it in the earlier 1990s by using the GBD2013 approach.

Its primary function is to protect central neurons while signaling the presence of systemic inflammation and infection to the brain to enable a protective sickness behavior response. With increasing degrees and duration of systemic inflammation, the vascular blood–brain barrier becomes more permeable to solutes, undergoes an increase in lymphocyte trafficking, and is infiltrated by innate immune cells; endothelial cell damage may occasionally occur. Perturbation of neuronal function results in the clinical features of encephalopathy. Here, the molecular and cellular anatomy of the vascular blood–brain barrier is reviewed, first in a healthy context and second in a systemic inflammatory context. Distinct from the molecular and cellular mediators of the blood–brain barrier’s response to inflammation, several moderators influence the direction and magnitude at genetic, system, cellular and molecular levels. These include sex, genetic background, age, pre-existing brain pathology, systemic comorbidity, and gut dysbiosis. Further progress is required to define and measure mediators and moderators of the blood–brain barrier’s response to systemic inflammation in order to explain the heterogeneity observed in animal and human studies.","Galea, Ian",Cell Mol Immunol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34594000/; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41423-021-00757-x,193

Liver graft dysfunction may be a rare complication. Some patients complain about the post-COVID-19 syndrome. The aim of this study was to assess medium and short-term outcomes in liver transplant patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A retrospective case series was performed at a tertiary referral center. We screened 845 patients who had liver transplant (LT) in our center. All consecutive LT patients with COVID-19 during the Spanish outbreak from March 2020 to April 2021, were included. Demographics, pre-existing comorbidities, clinical and radiological data of COVID-19 infection, complications and liver graft function were assessed at diagnosis and 3-month follow-up. RESULTS: Overall, 20 LT patients were diagnosed with confirmed COVID-19. We included 16 patients that met the inclusion criteria, 8 nonhospitalised (50%) and 8 (50%) hospitalised patients were analyzed. The median follow-up was 5.33 months (IQR 3.06-8.26). One patient died during the follow-up. All patients presented some grade of respiratory or functional symptoms. Dyspnoea and fatigue were the most prevalent symptoms during the 3-months follow-up. No Liver graft dysfunction were reported despite of partial immunosuppression withdrawal in 4 patients (25%). One patient had cardiovascular complications. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest the presence of post-COVID-19 syndrome with mild residual physical and psychological dysfunction in this subgroup of patients at 3-month after COVID-19. However, no cases of loss or liver graft dysfunction were reported.","Tejedor-Tejada, Javier; Fuentes-Valenzuela, Esteban; Alonso-Martin, Carmen; Almohalla-Alvarez, Carolina; Garcia-Pajares, Felix",J Clin Exp Hepatol,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0973688321001110?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jceh.2021.05.009; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0973688321001110; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34092967/,193

A cross‐sectional bibliometric review of COVID‐19 literature was undertaken between 1 November 2019 and 24 March 2020, along with a comparative review of Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) literature. Investigator responsiveness was assessed by measuring the volume and type of research published. Editorial responsiveness was assessed by measuring the submission‐to‐acceptance time and availability of original data. Publisher‐responsiveness was assessed by measuring the acceptance‐to‐publication time and the provision of open access. Three hundred and ninety‐eight of 2,835 COVID‐19 and 55 of 1,513 MERS search results were eligible. Most COVID‐19 studies were clinical reports (n = 242; 60.8%).

METHODS: Consecutive patients with nonsevere COVID-19 were retrospectively included. Asymptomatic patients with normal body temperature and no evidence of pneumonia throughout the disease course were classified in the asymptomatic group. The reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay was repeated every two to five days after the first follow-up RT-PCR assay. Negative conversion was defined as two consecutive negative results of RT-PCR assays within a 24-h interval. Rebound of threshold cycle (Ct) value was defined as negative from the single RT-PCR assay and positive from the following assay.

Following a common viral pneumonia, a multisystem inflammatory syndrome sometimes occurs, including an Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) carrying a high mortality. Unlike most common respiratory viruses, children seem less susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection and generally develop a mild disease with low mortality. However, clusters of severe shock associated with high levels of cardiac biomarkers and unusual vasoplegia requiring inotropes, vasopressors and volume loading have been recently described. Both clinical symptoms (i.e., high and persistent fever, gastrointestinal disorders, skin rash, conjunctivitis and dry cracked lips) and biological signs (e.g., elevated CRP/PCT, hyperferritinemia) resembled Kawasaki disease. In most instances, intravenous immunoglobin therapy improved the cardiac function and led to full recovery within a few days. However, adjunctive steroid therapy and sometimes biotherapy (e.g., anti-IL-1Ra, anti-IL-6 monoclonal antibodies) were often necessary. Although almost all children fully recovered within a week, some of them developed coronary artery dilation or aneurysm. Thus, a new ‘Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome associated with SARS-CoV-2′ has been recently described in children and helps to better understand Kawasaki disease pathophysiology.","Mercier, J.-C.; Maroni, A.; Levy, M.; Melki, I.; Meinzer, U.; Gaschignard, J.; Beyler, C.; Santos, A.",Bull Acad Natl Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33753947/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0001407921001072; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.banm.2020.11.018; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0001407921001072?v=s5,193
647154,Should covid vaccination be mandatory for health and care staff?,2021,"BACKGROUND: Within-household transmission of SARS-CoV-2 infection has been identified as one of the main sources of spread of COVID-19 after lockdown restrictions and self-isolation guidelines are implemented. Secondary attack rates among household contacts are estimated to be five to ten times higher than among non-household contacts, but it is unclear which individuals are more prone to transmit infection within their households. METHODS: Using address matching, a cohort was assembled of all laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID-19 residing in private households in Ontario, Canada. Descriptive analyses were performed to compare characteristics of cases in households that experienced secondary transmission versus those that did not. Logistic regression models were fit to determine index case characteristics and neighbourhood characteristics associated with transmission. RESULTS: Between January and July, 2020, there were 26,714 cases of COVID-19 residing in 21,226 households. Longer testing delays (≥5 days versus 0 days OR=3.02, 95% CI: 2.53 - 3.60) and male gender (OR=1.28, 95% CI: 1.18 - 1.38) were associated with greater odds of household secondary transmission, while being a healthcare worker (OR=0.56, 95% CI: 0.50 - 0.62) was associated with lower odds of transmission. Neighbourhoods with larger average family size and a higher proportion of households with multiple persons per room were also associated with greater odds of transmission. CONCLUSIONS: It is important for individuals to get tested for SARS-CoV-2 infection as soon as symptoms appear, and to isolate away from household contacts; this is particularly important in neighbourhoods with large family sizes and/or crowded households.","Paul, Lauren A; Daneman, Nick; Brown, Kevin A; Johnson, James; van Ingen, Trevor; Joh, Eugene; Wilson, Sarah E; Buchan, Sarah A",Clin Infect Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33751026/; https://doi.org/10.1093/cid/ciab186,193

We aimed to explore the association of RAAS inhibitors, including angiotensin-converting inhibitors (ACEi) and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) with COVID-19 mortality in patients with hypertension. Methods: MEDLINE, SCOPUS, OVID, and Cochrane Library were searched for the period of January 1, 2020 to May 20, 2020. Studies reporting the association of RAAS inhibitors (ACEi and ARBs) and mortality in patients with hypertension, hospitalized for COVID-19 were extracted. Two reviewers independently extracted appropriate data of interest and assessed the risk of bias. All analyses were performed using random-effects models on log-transformed risk ratio estimates, and heterogeneity was quantified. Results: Data were collected on 2,065,805 individuals (mean age, 58.73 years; 53.4% male). Patients with hypertension taking RAAS inhibitors were 35% less likely to die from COVID-19 compared to patients with hypertension not taking RAAS inhibitors (pooled RR= 0.65, 95% Confidence Intervals (CI): 0.45-0.94). To explore the association of COVID-19 and specific classes of RAAS inhibitors, we conducted a subgroup analysis of ARBs and ACEi separately from studies that provided them. Pooled risk ratio estimates from ARBs and ACEi showed a lower but not significant risk of death from COVID-19 (RR=0.93, 95% CI: 0.70-1.22) and ACEi (RR=0.65, 95% CI: 0.32-1.30). Conclusions: In this meta-analysis, it was discovered that taking RAAS inhibitors, significantly decreased the risk of COVID-19 mortality in patients with hypertension. This indicates a potential protective role that RAAS-inhibitors may have in COVID-19 patients with hypertension.","Ssentongo, A.; Ssentongo, P.; Heilbrunn, E.

Thus, developing effective drugs remains urgent. We identify two potent antibodies, nCoVmab1 and nCoVmab2, targeting the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein receptor-binding domain (RBD) with high affinities from a naïve human phage-displayed Fab library. nCoVmab1 and nCoVmab2 neutralize authentic SARS-CoV-2 with picomolar and nanomolar IC(50) values, respectively. No detectable defects of nCoVmab1 and nCoVmab2 are found during the preliminary druggability evaluation. nCoVmab1 could reduce viral titer and lung injury when administered prophylactically and therapeutically in human angiotensin-converting enzyme II (hACE2)-transgenic mice. Therefore, phage display platform could be efficiently used for rapid development of neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (nmabs) with clinical potential against emerging infectious diseases. In addition, we determinate epitopes in RBD of these antibodies to elucidate the neutralizing mechanism. We also convert nCoVmab1 and nCoVmab2 to their germline formats for further analysis, which reveals the contribution of somatic hypermutation (SHM) during nCoVmab1 and nCoVmab2 maturation. Our findings not only provide two highly potent nmabs against SARS-CoV-2 as prophylactic and therapeutic candidates, but also give some clues for development of anti-SARS-CoV-2 agents (e.g., drugs and vaccines) targeting the RBD.","Zhao, Shaojuan; Zhang, Huajun; Yang, Xinglou; Zhang, Haiwei; Chen, Ying; Zhan, Yancheng; Zhang, Xiaoqing; Jiang, Rendi; Liu, Meiqin; Liu, Lan; Chen, Li; Tang, Wei; Peng, Cheng; Gao, Xiaoxiao; Zhang, Zhe; Shi, Zhengli; Gong, Rui",Nat Commun,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-021-25153-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34373446/,193

We developed and piloted an LGBTQ-youth-focused intervention to build resilience and promote health equity, called Pride Camp, in an urban environment in the Midwest. METHODS: Using a mixed-method approach we examined the impact of Pride Camp on resilience and other measures of well-being among LGBTQ high school students who attended camp on a college campus in 2015, 2016, and 2017. Camp attendees and the research sample included a majority proportion of transgender and gender nonbinary (TGN) youth. RESULTS: Pre- and post-test data from our quantitative surveys (n = 28), indicated significant increases in resilience, self-esteem, and quality of life in LGBTQ youth who attended camp. Similar results were found among the TGN participants (n = 19). Qualitative data from focus groups indicated that specifically for TGN youth, the affirming environment at the camp provided social opportunities that they had not found elsewhere. CONCLUSIONS: Findings suggest that the Pride Camp intervention provides a platform for LGBTQ youth to meet peers and engage in LGBTQ communities, improving their resilience and outlook on the future. A larger controlled study of the Pride Camp intervention including measurement of additional specific health outcomes over a longer follow-up period is warranted to examine the impact of this program on health equity.","Weinhardt, Lance S.; Wesp, Linda M.; Xie, Hui; Murray, Jennifer (Jen); Martín, Jeanette; DeGeorge, Sarah; Weinhardt, Caleb B.; Hawkins, Maren; Stevens, Patricia",Int J Equity Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34187477/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12939-021-01488-1,193

This virus is able to attack the cells of the airway epithelium by binding to the transmembrane angiotensin I converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). In the current study, we experimented a food supplement containing alpha-cyclodextrin and hydroxytyrosol as active compounds for the improvement of the defenses against the SARS-CoV-2. Hydroxytyrosol has anti-viral properties and is able to reduce the serum lipids in mice fed with high-cholesterol diet, and α-cyclodextrin has the ability to deplete sphingolipids and phospholipids from the cellular membranes. The aim of the present preliminary open non-controlled interventional study was to evaluate the efficacy of alpha-cyclodextrin and hydroxytyrosol in improving defenses against SARS-CoV-2. METHODS: Fifty healthy volunteers at a higher risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection from Northern Cyprus and six positive individuals for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-qPCR assay were enrolled in this study. The in silico prediction analysis was performed using the bioinformatic tool D3DOCKING to evaluate the interactions of hydroxytyrosol and alpha-cyclodextrin with proteins involved in the biological cycle of SARS-CoV-2 in the humans. RESULTS: The 50 volunteers did not become positive in 15 days for SARS-CoV-2 RT-qPCR assay after the administration of the compound for two weeks, despite they were at higher risk of infection than the general population. Interestingly, in the cohort of six positive patients, two patients were administered with the spray and became negative after five days of spray administration, despite the viral load was higher in the treated subjects than the patients that did not take the compound and that became negative after ten days. In addition, we have identified the presence of possible direct interactions among hydroxytyrosol and alpha-cyclodextrin with the viral protein Spike and the human proteins ACE2 and TMPRSS2. CONCLUSIONS: We preliminary reported on the results of the possible role of alpha-cyclodextrin and hydroxytyrosol in improving defenses against SARS-CoV-2. The next step would be the administration of the compound on a larger cohort in a controlled study and see whether there is a reduced infection rate of SARS-CoV-2 in the treated subjects than in the non-treated individuals.

648160,Factors associated with mental health outcomes among medical residents exposed to COVID-19,2021-02-15,"Kidney transplantation is the ideal choice of kidney replacement therapy in children as it offers a low risk of mortality and a better quality of life. A wide variance in the access to kidney replacement therapies exists across the world with only 21% of low- and low-middle income countries (LLMIC) undertaking kidney transplantation. Pediatric kidney transplantation rates in these under-resourced regions are reported to be as low as < 4 pmcp [per million child population]. A robust kidney failure care program forms the cornerstone of a transplant program. Even the smallest transplant program entails a multidisciplinary workforce and expertise besides ensuring family commitment towards long-term care and economic burden. In general, the short-term graft survival rates from under-resourced regions are comparable to most high-income countries (HIC) and the challenge lies in the long-term outcomes. This review focuses on specific issues relevant to kidney transplants in children in under-resourced regions by highlighting limitations in the capacity and health workforce, regulatory norms, medical issues, economic burden, factors beyond financial hardship and ethical considerations relevant to these regions. Finally, the perspective of strengthening transplant programs in these regions should factor in the bigger challenges that exist in achieving the health-related sustainable development goals by 2030.","Iyengar, Arpana; McCulloch, M.

Zn(2+) ions, as an essential trace element, have functional roles in improving the immunophysiological cellular environment, accelerating bone regeneration, and inhibiting biofilm formation. In this study, we reconstruct SAON lesions with a three-dimensional (3D)-a printed composite made of poly (epsilon-caprolactone) (PCL) and nanoparticulate Willemite (npW). Rabbit bone marrow stem cells were used to evaluate the cytocompatibility and osteogenic differentiation capability of the PCL/npW composite scaffolds. The 2-month bone regeneration was assessed by a Micro-computed tomography (micro-CT) scan and the expression of bone regeneration proteins by Western blot. Compared with the neat PCL group, PCL/npW scaffolds exhibited significantly increased cytocompatibility and osteogenic activity. This finding reveals a new concept for the design of a 3D-printed PCL/npW composite-based bone substitute for the early treatment of osteonecrosis defects.","Karimzadeh Bardeei, Latifeh; Seyedjafari, Ehsan; Hossein, Ghamartaj; Nabiuni, Mohammad; Majles Ara, Mohammad Hosein; Salber, Jochen",Int J Mol Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34638673/; https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms221910332,193

As a pandemic with a high contagion level, necessary social distancing measures have been put in place across the world to slow transmission and protect medical services. We first present literature that shows that among the effects of social distancing are social and functional isolation and economic stress, which are known to increase domestic violence.

To determine the potential impact of exposure to SARS-CoV-2 in utero on the neonate, we have assessed the immunological status of infants born to mothers with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection during gestation. No evidence of vertical transmission of SARS-CoV-2 was observed, but transfer of maternal SARS-CoV-2 specific IgG to infants was apparent, although to a lesser extent in cases of active or recent maternal infection. Infants born to mothers with recent/ongoing infection had elevated circulating pro-inflammatory cytokines and enhanced percentages of innate immune cells compared to that seen in infants born to uninfected mothers. In tandem, higher frequencies of FOXP3+ regulatory T cells and circulating IL-10 demonstrated a further nuance to the neonatal effector response. Interestingly, cytokine functionality was enhanced in infants born to mothers exposed to SARS-CoV-2 at any time during pregnancy. This indicates that maternal SARS-CoV-2 infection influences in utero priming of the fetal immune system.","Gee, Sarah; Chandiramani, Manju; Seow, Jeffrey; Modestini, Carlotta; Das, Abhishek; Doores, Katie J; Tribe, Rachel M; Gibbons, Deena L",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.05.27.446014,193

Commuting distance and commuting time were analyzed separately in the model. We excluded participants with incalculable commuting distance, commuting distance exceeding 300 km, commuting distance of 0 km, or who telecommuted at least once a week. Results: The total number of participants included in the analysis was 14038. The adjusted odds ratios (aORs) of using public transportation for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection were 4.17 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.51-6.93) (commuting time) and 5.18 (95% CI: 3.06-8.78) (commuting distance). The aOR of COVID-19 diagnosis decreased significantly with increasing commuting distance. The aORs of using public transportation to infection anxiety were 1.44 (95% CI: 1.31-1.59) (commuting time) and 1.45 (95% CI: 1.32-1.60) (commuting distance). The longer the commuting time, the more the aOR increased.. Conclusions: COVID-19 risk, close contact, and infection anxiety were all associated with the use of public transportation during commuting. Both commuting distance and time were associated with infection anxiety due to commuting, and the strength of the association increased with increase in commuting time distance. Since transportation by commuting is associated with COVID-19 risk and anxiety, we recommend the use of telecommuting and other means of work.","Ando, H.; Ikegami, K.; Nagata, T.; Tateishi, S.; Eguchi, H.; Tsuji, M.; Matsuda, S.; Fujino, Y.; Ogami, A.; project, the CORoNaWork",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.05.01.21256090; http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.05.01.21256090v1?rss=1,193
656580,Coronavirus disease in children: A multicentre study from the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia,2021-01-18,"BACKGROUND: Intestinal barrier breakdown, a frequent complication of intestinal ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) including dysfunction and the structure changes of the intestine, is characterized by a loss of tight junction and enhanced permeability of the intestinal barrier and increased mortality. To develop effective and novel therapeutics is important for the improvement of outcome of patients with intestinal barrier deterioration. Recombinant human angiopoietin-like protein 4 (rhANGPTL4) is reported to protect the blood-brain barrier when administered exogenously, and endogenous ANGPTL4 deficiency deteriorates radiation-induced intestinal injury. AIM: To identify whether rhANGPTL4 may protect intestinal barrier breakdown induced by I/R. METHODS: Intestinal I/R injury was elicited through clamping the superior mesenteric artery for 60 min followed by 240 min reperfusion. Intestinal epithelial (Caco-2) cells and human umbilical vein endothelial cells were challenged by hypoxia/ reoxygenation to mimic I/R in vitro. RESULTS: Indicators including fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated dextran (4 kilodaltons; FD-4) clearance, ratio of phosphorylated myosin light chain/total myosin light chain, myosin light chain kinase and loss of zonula occludens-1, claudin-2 and VE-cadherin were significantly increased after intestinal I/R or cell hypoxia/reoxygenation. rhANGPTL4 treatment significantly reversed these indicators, which were associated with inhibiting the inflammatory and oxidative cascade, excessive activation of cellular autophagy and apoptosis and improvement of survival rate. Similar results were observed in vitro when cells were challenged by hypoxia/reoxygenation, whereas rhANGPTL4 reversed the indicators close to normal level in Caco-2 cells and human umbilical vein endothelial cells significantly. CONCLUSION: rhANGPTL4 can function as a protective agent against intestinal injury induced by intestinal I/R and improve survival via maintenance of intestinal barrier structure and functions.","Wang, Zi-Yi; Lin, Jian-Yu; Feng, Yang-Rong; Liu, De-Shun; Zhao, Xu-Zi; Li, Tong; Li, Si-Yuan; Sun, Jing-Chao; Li, Shu-Feng; Jia, Wen-Yan; Jing, Hui-Rong",World J Gastroenterol,https://doi.org/10.3748/wjg.v27.i32.5404; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34539141/,193

Some environmental risk factors are currently described as predictors of diabetes, with access to green spaces being an element to consider in urban settings. This review aims to study the association between exposure to green spaces and outcomes such as diabetes, obesity, and physical activity in the general population. A systematic review was carried out using the PubMed, Embase, and LILACS databases and other sources. The search strategy was carried out from October 2019 to October 2020. Cross-sectional and cohort studies were included. The article selection was made by a pair of reviewers, and data extraction was carried out using a data extraction sheet. The quality assessment of the included studies was carried out using a validated tool. Finally, 19 scientific articles were included in this review. Evidence supports that people and communities exposed to green spaces, especially in their neighborhood, reduce the risk of T2DM and reduce the risk of being obese and increase the likelihood of physical activity. The onset of T2DM can be moderated by using green spaces, improving physical activity levels, and reducing the risk of being overweight and obese.","De la Fuente, Felipe; Saldías, María Angélica; Cubillos, Camila; Mery, Gabriela; Carvajal, Daniela; Bowen, Martín; Bertoglia, María Paz",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18010097; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33375559/,193
657366,CHILDHOOD SYSTEMIC LUPUS ERYTHEMATOSUS AND COVID‐19,2021-03-22,"BACKGROUND: Considered an epicenter of pandemic influenza virus generation, southern China has recently seen an increasing number of human H7N9 infections. However, it is not the only threat. On 30 November 2013, a human H10N8 infection case was first described in China. The origin and genetic diversity of this novel virus is similar to that of H7N9 virus. As H10N8 avian influenza virus (AIV) was first identified from a duck in Guangdong Province during 2012 and there is also evidence of H10N8 infected dogs in this region, we sought to examine archived sera from animal workers to see if there was evidence of subclinical human infections before the first human H10N8 cases. METHODS: We studied archived serum samples (cross-sectional study, convenience sample) collected between May and September 2013 from 710 animal workers and 107 non-animal exposed volunteers living in five cities of Guangdong Province. Study participants’ sera were tested by horse red blood cells (RBCs) hemagglutination inhibition (HI) and microneutralization (MN) assays according to World Health Organization guidelines. The A/Jiangxi-Donghu/346-1/2013(H10N8) virus was used. Sera which have an HI assay ≥1:20 were further tested with the MN assay. Questionnaire data were examined for risk factor associations with positive serological assays. Risk factor analyses failed to identify specific factors associated with probable H10N8 infections. RESULTS: Among the 827 sera, only 21 animal workers had an HI titer ≥1:20 (18 had an HI titer of 1:20 and 3 had an HI titer of 1:40). None of these 21 subjects reported experiencing any influenza symptoms during the three months before enrollment. Among the three subjects with HI titers of 1:40, two had MN antibody titers of 1:40, and one had a MN antibody titer of 1:80 (probable H10N8 infections). CONCLUSIONS: Study data suggest that animal workers may have been infected with the H10N8 virus before the first recognized H10N8 human infection cases. It seems prudent to continue surveillance for H10N8 viruses among animal workers.","Qi, Wenbao; Su, Shuo; Xiao, Chencheng; Zhou, Pei; Li, Huanan; Ke, Changwen; Gray, Gregory C; Zhang, Guihong; Liao, Ming",BMC Med,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12916-014-0205-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25348464/,193
658350,When lockdown policies amplify social inequalities in COVID-19 infections. Evidence from a cross-sectional population-based survey in France,2020,"COVID-19 related guidelines and movement restrictions are designed to protect the public’s health and reduce disease transmission; yet, COVID-19 related restrictions on movement including social distancing, isolation, quarantine, and shelter-in-place orders have an unknown effect on violence and abuse within relationships. As the pandemic has progressed, many have justifiably speculated that such restrictions may pose a danger to the safety and well-being of people experiencing such violence. Early in the pandemic, countries hard hit by COVID-19 began raising the alarm bell about the impacts of the disease on IPV occurrence. Police in China report that 90% of the causes of recent IPV cases could be attributed to the COVID-19 epidemic. Rising fears and anxiety about prolonged movement restrictions, increased economic strain and diminished health care capacity to support survivors are among the potential reasons for such dramatic effects. Under normal circumstances: low income, unemployment, economic stress, depression, emotional insecurity and social isolation are all risk factors for using violence against partners. Many of these factors may worsen in the context of COVID-19. Despite the urgency in addressing COVID-19, existing health concerns like Intimate Partner Violence (IPV) persist—and may well be worsened by the virus. We simply do not yet know the effects of COVID-19 on violence, nor do we know which interventions work best to prevent and respond to it within the context of the pandemic. The vast majority of information available about IPV and violence during the pandemic has been based on anecdotal reports. The call to action for the research community is clear. We must systematically measure the effects of COVID-19 and movement related restrictions on violence. As always when researching violence, serious consideration must be given to ethics and safety. Violence researchers must mobilize to investigate the impacts of COVID-19 on violence and human health.","Evans, Dabney P.",BMC Womens Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33172466/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12905-020-01115-1,193

658957,Mental health problems faced by healthcare workers due to the COVID-19 pandemic- a review,2020-04-22,"BACKGROUND: Human coronaviruses (HCoVs) are a well-known cause of respiratory infections but their role in gastrointestinal infections is unclear. The objective of our study was to assess the significance of HCoVs in the etiology of acute gastroenteritis (AGE) in children <6 years of age. METHODS: Stool samples and nasopharyngeal (NP) swabs collected from 260 children hospitalized for AGE (160 also had respiratory symptoms) and 157 otherwise healthy control children admitted for elective surgery were tested for the presence of four HCoVs using real time RT-PCR. Registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (reg. NCT00987519). RESULTS: HCoVs were more frequent in patients with AGE than in controls (23/260, 8.8% versus 4/151, 2.6%; odds ratio, OR 3.3; 95% confidence interval, CI 1.3–10.0; P = 0.01). Three of four HCoV-positive members in the control group, asymptomatic when sampled, recalled gastrointestinal or respiratory symptoms within the previous 14 days. In patients with AGE, HCoVs were present in NP samples more often than in stools (22/256, 8.6%, versus 6/260, 2.3%; P = 0.0004). In 5/6 children with HCoVs detected in stools, the viruses were also detected in NP swabs. Patients had a significantly higher probability of HCoV detection in stool (OR 4; 95% CI 1.4–15.3; P = 0.006) and also in stool and/or NP (OR 3.3, 95% CI 1.3–10.0; P = 0.01) than healthy controls. All four HCoVs species were detected in stool and NP samples. CONCLUSIONS: Although HCoVs were more frequently detected in patients with AGE than in the control group, high prevalence of HCoVs in NP swabs compounded by their low occurrence in stool samples and detection of other viruses in stool samples, indicate that HCoVs probably play only a minor role in causing gastrointestinal illness in children <6 years old.","Jevšnik, Monika; Steyer, Andrej; Zrim, Tamara; Pokorn, Marko; Mrvič, Tatjana; Grosek, Štefan; Strle, Franc; Lusa, Lara; Petrovec, Miroslav",Virol J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23379823/; https://doi.org/10.1186/1743-422x-10-46,193

METHODS: This is a retrospective cohort study which included 115 cycles with pre-implantation genetic testing for aneuploidy (PGT-A). Two groups were allocated based on the biopsy protocols: method 1 group, the zona pellucida (ZP) was drilled on day 3 embryos followed by trophectoderm (TE) biopsy; and method 2 group, the ZP was opened on day 5 or 6 blastocysts followed by TE biopsy. All biopsy samples were assessed using next-generation sequencing (NGS) at a single reference laboratory. The euploid, aneuploid, and mosaic blastocyst rates and clinical outcomes were compared. RESULTS: The mosaicism rate in the method 1 group was 19.58%, significantly higher than the method 2 group (8.12%; P < 0.05). No statistically significant difference was observed in euploid, aneuploid blastocyst rates, and clinical pregnancy rates between the two groups. Logistic regression analysis indicated that the biopsy protocols were independently associated with the mosaicism rates among all the variables. CONCLUSIONS: The present study showed that different biopsy protocols may have an impact on the mosaic blastocyst rate. ZP opening on day 3 combined with TE biopsy might increase the incidence of mosaic blastocysts.","Xiong, Shun; Liu, Weiwei; Wang, Jiang; Liu, Junxia; Gao, Yang; Wu, Lihong; Zhu, Jiahong; Hao, Xiangwei; Li, Jingyu; Liu, Dongyun; Han, Wei; Huang, Guoning",J Assist Reprod Genet,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10815-021-02137-w; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33660205/,193

Applicant perceptions of multiple interview components were queried to identify program specific and interview modality specific strengths or weaknesses in the 2020 to 2021 Urology Match. METHODS: A 12 question multiple choice and free text survey was emailed to 66 virtually interviewed applicants for open residency positions at a metropolitan training program after conclusion of interviews. Items of interest included interview type preference, overall interview impression, and recommendations for improvement. RESULTS: A total of 50 of 66 (76%) applicants completed the survey corresponding to approximately 11% of the 2020 national urology applicant pool. A total of 49 of 50 (96%) respondents assessed faculty interaction and the virtual platform positively. A total of 38 of 50 (76%) was satisfied with their resident interaction and 32 of 50 (64%) applicants stated they were able to satisfactorily evaluate the site and program. Ultimately, 39 of 50 (78%) respondents would have preferred an in person interview to our virtual interview. Respondents cited challenges in assessing program culture and program physical site virtually. CONCLUSION: The majority of survey respondents indicated a preference for in person interviews. A smaller proportion of applicants preferred virtual interviews citing their convenience and lower cost.

Starting in 2013, flexible and integrative psychiatric care model projects according to §64b SGB V German Social Law (FIT64b) have been implemented. The study “PsychCare” combines quantitative and qualitative primary data with routine health insurance data for the evaluation of these models. Effects, costs and cost-effectiveness from the perspectives of patients, relatives and care providers are compared with standard care. Additionally, quality indicators for a modern, flexible and integrated care are developed. This article describes the rationale, design and methods of the project. Methods: “PsychCare” is built on a multiperspective and multimethod design. A controlled prospective multicenter cohort study is conducted with three data collection points (baseline assessment, follow-up after 9 and 15 months). A total of 18 hospitals (10 FIT64b model and 8 matched control hospitals) have consecutively recruited in- and outpatients with pre-specified common and/or severe psychiatric disorders. Primary endpoints are differences in change of health-related quality of life and treatment satisfaction. Sociodemographic and service receipt data of the primary data collection are linked with routine health insurance data. A cost-effectiveness analysis, a mixed method, participatory process evaluation by means of qualitative surveys and the development of quality indicators are further elements of “PsychCare.” Discussion and Practical Implications: The results based on data from different methodological approaches will provide essential conclusions for the improvement of hospital based mental health care in Germany. This should result in the identification of key FIT64b elements that can be efficiently implemented into standard care in Germany and re-structure the care strongly aligned to patient needs.

663390,Evaluation of a Commercial Mobile Health App for Depression and Anxiety (AbleTo Digital+): Retrospective Cohort Study,2021,"BackgroundSchool closures were part of a series of non-pharmacological intervention (NPI) measures addressing the COVID-19 pandemic in Cyprus. We aimed to study changes in the environment, diet, behavior, personal hygiene, contacts, lifestyle choices and the degree of compliance to NPI measures by primary school children in Cyprus at school and at home for two periods, i.e., before lockdown and during the school re-opening using the methodological context of the human exposome. MethodsDuring June 2020, an online survey questionnaire was forwarded to parents of primary school children through schools administrations, with questions about the childrens lifestyle/behaviours for two periods; school re-opening, following the population-wide lockdown (May 21-June 26, 2020), and the school period before lockdown (before March 2020). Descriptive statistics and exposome wide association analysis were implemented to agnostically assess associations of demographic, lifestyle and behavioral parameters with the degree of compliance to NPI measures. FindingsA total of 1509 children from more than 180 primary schools (out of 330 schools) in Cyprus were included. Median number of contacts per day at home, school and other places during weekdays was lower (p<0.001) in the post-lockdown period compared to the pre-lockdown period (5 vs 12, 10 vs 29 and 6 vs 14, respectively). Vulnerable contacts with children also decreased from 2[1, 3] in the pre-lockdown to 1[0, 2] in the post-lockdown period (p<0.001). Differences in sugary and ready-made food consumption, physical activity, screen time, digital communication and hand hygiene were noted between the two periods. More than 72% of children complied with the NPI measures, with the exception of the decrease in number of vulnerable contact(s) indicator (48%). Eating meat more frequently post-lockdown and doing less physical activity during school break post-lockdown were positively associated with increased time spent at home post-lockdown. Furthermore, the odds of compliance, as indicated by the time spent at home post-lockdown were lower with days elapsing from school re-opening, living in smaller town and using antiseptic more frequently pre-lockdown. InterpretationIn this national survey, children showed a high degree of compliance to most NPI measures for the community and primary school settings in Cyprus. The initial NPI measures may have affected the childrens exposome profile in the following months, by altering their diet, physical activity, sedentary lifestyle and hand hygiene habits. FundingThe study was partially funded by the EXPOSOGAS project, H2020 under grant agreement #810995 Panel: Research in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSWe searched PubMed for studies published until September 30, 2020 using the search terms: COVID-19, children and lifestyle. Only six peer-reviewed, English-language studies were retrieved on the effect of COVID-19 measures on childrens lifestyle. The impact of non-pharmacological intervention (NPI) measures on childrens health during the pandemic period has been sporadically studied by focusing on a few risk factors at a time without using the exposomes methodological framework, which is defined as the comprehensive characterization of all environmental exposures during ones lifetime. Added value of this studyA survey targeted all primary schools of Cyprus to comprehensively study the impact of the initial population-wide NPI measures (lockdown) (March 13-May 4) on the childrens exposome during the school re-opening period (May 21 - June 26). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study looking at the post-confinement (lockdown) exposome profile changes of children during schools re-opening, after the initial population-wide NPI measures of COVID-19 response. The comprehensive and agnostic description of the childrens exposome profile may help to comprehensively account for both known and possibly unknown effects of NPI measures on childrens health and for delineating the childrens degree of compliance to infection prevention and control protocols at school and at home. Implications of all the available evidenceThis dataset could inform COVID-19 risk-based public health response strategies targeted for school settings. Future response strategies to epidemic waves shall consider elements of promoting a healthy lifestyle for children at school and at home.

These two facts can have conflicting implications because BIPOC populations are younger than white populations. In analyses of California and Minnesota—demographically divergent states—we show that COVID vaccination schedules based solely on age benefit the older white populations at the expense of younger BIPOC populations with higher risk of death from COVID-19. We find that strategies that prioritize high-risk geographic areas for vaccination at all ages better target mortality risk than age-based strategies alone, although they do not always perform as well as direct prioritization of high-risk racial/ethnic groups. Vaccination schemas directly implicate equitability of access, both domestically and globally.","Wrigley-Field, Elizabeth; Kiang, Mathew V.; Riley, Alicia R.; Barbieri, Magali; Chen, Yea-Hung; Duchowny, Kate A.; Matthay, Ellicott C.; Van Riper, David; Jegathesan, Kirrthana; Bibbins-Domingo, Kirsten; Leider, Jonathon P.",Science Advances,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34586843/; https://doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.abj2099,193

METHODS: We queried PubMed(R), for citations to the following: MRSA, HIV/AIDS, Staphylococcus aureus, severe acute respiratory syndrome, Lyme disease, avian influenza, West Nile virus, Chikungunya, Ebola virus and Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome. Incidence or mortality data were tabulated. RESULTS: We identified 560,225 citations in 1963–2014. There were two distinct qualitative citation patterns. Type I pathogens showed a decade of initial exponential growth. Type II pathogens showed a sudden spike in citations in a year or two, followed by a relative decline. MRSA most closely resembled a Type I pathogen. CONCLUSIONS: The Type I pattern pathogens had varied trends in disease incidence in the years following the exponential growth and subsequent decline in the number of citations. Their differing epidemiologic patterns did not correlate with their pattern of citations. We conclude that citation trends on MRSA cannot be used to determine past epidemiologic trends and also that the citation trend for MRSA in 1995–2011 most closely resembled that for HIV in 1981–1998.","Morgan, Ethan; David, Michael Z.",BMC Infect Dis,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12879-015-1182-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26502873/,193

Importantly, the World Health Organization sees asthma as being underdiagnosed and undertreated. Consequently, much more efforts in clinical disease management and research need to be spent on reducing the asthma-related health burden. Particularly, for young approximately 6 months aged patients presenting recurrent bronchitic respiratory symptoms, many parents anxiously ask the doctors for risk prognosis for their children's future life. Therefore, we urgently need to reevaluate if the current diagnostic and treatment measures are in concordance with our yet incomplete knowledge of pathomechanisms on exacerbation. To contribute to this increasing concern worldwide, we established a multicentric pediatric exacerbation study network, still recruiting acute exacerbated asthmatics (children >6 years) and preschool asthmatics/wheezers (children <6 years) since winter 2018 in Germany. The current study that has a currently population comprising 176 study participants aims to discover novel holistic entry points for achieving a better understanding of the poorly understood plasticity of involved molecular pathways and to define biomarkers enabling improved diagnostics and therapeutics.

In particular, the viruses causing rinderpest, canine distemper, Newcastle disease, measles, and mumps have arguably caused more morbidity and mortality than any other single group of related viruses in history. The impact of these diseases has been dramatically reduced through the use of vaccines in both humans and animals, in combination with depopulation and restrictions on animal movements for diseases such as rinderpest and Newcastle disease. The history of the paramyxoviruses is replete with incorrect reports that complicate their taxonomic classification and confuses assessment of their true ability to cause interspecies infections. The nomenclature of viruses within the family Paramyxoviridae is confusing and fraught with inconsistencies, as individual viruses have variously been named according to their species of origin, geographic sites of discovery, antigenic relationships, or given names related to the diseases that they produce in affected animals or humans. Paramyxovirus virions are pleomorphic, 150–350 nm in diameter. Virions are enveloped, covered with large glycoprotein spikes, and contain a “herringbone-shaped” helically symmetrical nucleocapsid, approximately 1 μm in length and 18 nm (Paramyxovirinae) or 13–14 nm (Pneumovirinae) in diameter.

This rapid review sought to understand meaningful engagement in synthesis reviews from the patient partner (PP) perspective. DESIGN: The review team comprised PPs, librarians, SCPOR staff and academic faculty. We searched OVID MEDLINE and EMBASE, ProQuest Nursing and Allied Health, and core POR websites. Documents describing PP reflections on their involvement in synthesis reviews were included. Screening and data extraction were conducted by two independent reviewers. Thematic analysis was employed to identify themes in the data regarding PP perceptions of engagement in synthesis reviews. RESULTS: The literature search yielded 1386 citations. Eight journal articles and one blog post were included. Seven studies focused on conducting systematic reviews on a particular health or patient‐related topic to which PP involvement was an important part and two studies focused specifically on the experience of including PP in synthesis reviews. PPs engaged in the review process through a variety of mechanisms, levels and stages of the review process. Three major themes emerged from the data: (1) foster partnerships through team development, (2) provide opportunities for outcomes valued by PP and (3) strengthen the research endeavour. CONCLUSION: Fostering partnerships through team development is foundational for meaningful engagement in synthesis reviews. It requires sensitively balancing of various needs (eg overburdening with contributions). Meaningful involvement in reviews has both personal and research benefits.

What Do People Mean by COVID Waves? – A Working Definition of Epidemic Waves,2021-09-13,"Abstract The genome organization and expression strategy of the newly identified severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) were predicted using recently published genome sequences. Fourteen putative open reading frames were identified, 12 of which were predicted to be expressed from a nested set of eight subgenomic mRNAs. The synthesis of these mRNAs in SARS-CoV-infected cells was confirmed experimentally. The 4382- and 7073 amino acid residue SARS-CoV replicase polyproteins are predicted to be cleaved into 16 subunits by two viral proteinases (bringing the total number of SARS-CoV proteins to 28). A phylogenetic analysis of the replicase gene, using a distantly related torovirus as an outgroup, demonstrated that, despite a number of unique features, SARS-CoV is most closely related to group 2 coronaviruses. Distant homologs of cellular RNA processing enzymes were identified in group 2 coronaviruses, with four of them being conserved in SARS-CoV. These newly recognized viral enzymes place the mechanism of coronavirus RNA synthesis in a completely new perspective. Furthermore, together with previously described viral enzymes, they will be important targets for the design of antiviral strategies aimed at controlling the further spread of SARS-CoV.","Snijder, Eric J.; Bredenbeek, Peter J.; Dobbe, Jessika C.; Thiel, Volker; Ziebuhr, John; Poon, Leo L.M.; Guan, Yi; Rozanov, Mikhail; Spaan, Willy J.M.; Gorbalenya, Alexander E.",Journal of Molecular Biology,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0022283603008659; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022283603008659; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12927536/,193

Proteomic profiling indicates an increased expression of CD13 in phagocytes during Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection. The purpose of this study was to investigate the role of CD13 on the internalization and intracellular survival of M. tuberculosis in monocytes. METHODS: Magnetic nanoparticles and confocal microscopy were used to observe interactions between CD13 and M. tuberculosis. Mycobacterial entry and intracellular survival in monocytes were assessed with and without anti‐CD13 antibody (WM15 and WM47) using flow cytometry and colony formation assay. RESULTS: By using magnetic nanoparticles and confocal microscopy, M. tuberculosis was found to be capable of binding to either soluble CD13 or membranous CD13 on monocytes. Flow cytometry showed that pretreatment of monocytes with WM15 or WM47 reduced the number of intracellular M. tuberculosis. Collectively, the data suggest that CD13 is a binding and entry receptor for M. tuberculosis on monocytes. Treatment of infected monocytes showed a greater effect of WM47 than WM15 in reducing the intracellular colonization of M. tuberculosis, suggesting that specific epitopes of CD13 may play an important role modulating intracellular M. tuberculosis survival. CONCLUSIONS: CD13 acts as a receptor for M. tuberculosis on human monocytes. The molecule facilitates internalization, and interaction of CD13 with an anti‐CD13 antibody reduces intracellular M. tuberculosis survival.","Ho, Hsin‐Tsung; Tsai, I‐Fang; Wu, Chien‐Liang; Lu, Yen‐Ta",Respirology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24011358/; https://doi.org/10.1111/resp.12191,193

We aimed to assess the psychological impact of the coronavirus disease 2019 on health care workers and non-health care workers in three different epidemic areas in China and to identify independent risk factors. Methods: We surveyed 1,020 non-health care workers and 480 health care workers in Wuhan, other cities in Hubei except Wuhan and other provinces in China except Hubei. Results: Health care workers in Hubei had higher levels of anxiety and depression than non-health care workers (p < 0.05), but there was no such difference in other provinces in China except Hubei (p > 0.05). Compared with other regions, health care workers in Wuhan was more anxious (p < 0.05), and this anxiety may be caused by concerns about occupational exposure and wearing protective clothing for a long time daily; health care workers in Hubei had more obvious depression (p < 0.05), which may be associated with long days participating in epidemic work and wearing protective clothing for a long time daily. Meanwhile, 62.5% of health care workers were proud of their work. The anxiety and depression of non-health care workers in Wuhan were also the most serious. Conclusions: In Wuhan, where the epidemic is most severe, levels of anxiety and depression seem to be higher, especially among health care workers. This information may help to better prepare for future events.","Cao, Huan; Zuo, Chengchao; Li, Guo; Huang, Yaqi; Li, Ling; Huang, Shu; Zhao, Jianling; Liu, Jingjing; Jiang, Yongsheng; Wang, Furong",Front Psychiatry,https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2020.575705; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33250791/,193

Vaccines can be used more widely, especially in developing countries, if their cost of production can be reduced and they can be preserved without refrigeration.

Plant-derived vaccines do not face such limitations. Research under way is dedicated to solving these limitations by finding ways to produce oral (edible) vaccines from transgenic plants.

Different variables affect psychological stress response and professional quality of life. In this context, the role of professional values represents an interesting object of research. OBJECTIVES: To analyze the relationship between professional values, perceived stress, and professional quality of life among nurses during the COVID-19 crisis. RESEARCH DESIGN, PARTICIPANTS, AND RESEARCH CONTEXT: Descriptive cross-sectional study. Participants were 439 registered nurses from the public health system. Perceived stress, professional quality of life, and professional values were evaluated by using measuring instruments adapted and validated in the geographic context of research. Data were collected online in December 2020 during the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in Spain. ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS: This study was approved by the Ethics Committee on Clinical Research of the Principality of Asturias. FINDINGS: Within professional values, ethics obtained higher scores showing the primacy of ethical values among nurses. Moderate correlations between ethics, mastery, expertise, and compassion satisfaction were found. Frontline nurses informed high perceived stress. The correlations between professional values and compassion satisfaction were higher in non-frontline nurses. A moderate negative correlation between perceived stress and compassion satisfaction was found in both groups, which implies that the higher the stress, the lower the satisfaction in the helping relationship. CONCLUSION: Professional values positively influence compassion satisfaction during the COVID-19 pandemic. Compassion satisfaction presents a negative correlation with fatigue compassion and burnout in frontline and non-frontline nurses. Given the functionality of values both to guide clinical practice professionally and ethically, and prevent dissatisfaction with one's professional quality of life by reinforcing compassion satisfaction, it is necessary to reinforce them with an intensive and cross-sectional learning during the university training.","González-Pando, David; González-Nuevo, Covadonga; González-Menéndez, Ana; Alonso-Pérez, Fernando; Cuesta, Marcelino",Nurs Ethics,https://doi.org/10.1177/09697330211034250; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34463168/,193

ABSTRACT Background: The clinical course of COVID-19 critically ill patients, during their admission in the intensive care unit (UCI), including medical and infectious complications and support therapies, as well as their association with in-ICU mortality has not been fully reported. Objective: This study aimed to describe clinical characteristics and clinical course of ICU COVID-19 patients, and to determine risk factors for ICU mortality of COVID-19 patients. Methods: Prospective, multicentre, cohort study that enrolled critically ill COVID-19 patients admitted into 30 ICUs from Spain and Andorra. Consecutive patients from March 12th to May 26th, 2020 were enrolled if they had died or were discharged from ICU during the study period. Demographics, symptoms, vital signs, laboratory markers, supportive therapies, pharmacological treatments, medical and infectious complications were reported and compared between deceased and discharged patients. Results: A total of 663 patients were included. Overall ICU mortality was 31% (203 patients). At ICU admission non-survivors were more hypoxemic [SpO2 with non-rebreather mask, 90 (IQR 83 to 93) vs 91 (IQR 87 to 94); p<0.001] and with higher sequential organ failure assessment score [SOFA, 7 (IQR 5 to 9) vs 4 (IQR 3 to 7); p<0.001]. Complications were more frequent in non-survivors: acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) (95% vs 89%; p=0.009), acute kidney injury (AKI) (58% vs 24%; p<10-16), shock (42% vs 14%; p<10-13), and arrhythmias (24% vs 11%; p<10-4). Respiratory super-infection, bloodstream infection and septic shock were higher in non-survivors (33% vs 25%; p=0.03, 33% vs 23%; p=0.01 and 15% vs 3%, p=10-7), respectively. The multivariable regression model showed that age was associated with mortality, with every year increasing risk-of-death by 1% (95%CI: 1 to 10, p=0.014). Each 5-point increase in APACHE II independently predicted mortality [OR: 1.508 (1.081, 2.104), p= 0.015]. Patients with AKI [OR: 2.468 (1.628, 3.741), p<10-4)], cardiac arrest [OR: 11.099 (3.389, 36.353), p= 0.0001], and septic shock [OR: 3.224 (1.486, 6.994), p= 0.002] had an increased risk-of-death. Conclusions: Older COVID-19 patients with higher APACHE II scores on admission, those who developed AKI grades II or III and/or septic shock during ICU stay had an increased risk-of-death.

670933,Social Support Promotes Mental Health During the COVID-19 Outbreak: A Cross-Sectional Study from Turkey,2021,"[Image: see text] The outbreak of novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 has caused a worldwide threat to public health. COVID-19 patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection can develop clinical symptoms that are often confused with the infections of other respiratory pathogens. Sensitive and specific detection of SARS-CoV-2 with the ability to discriminate from other viruses is urgently needed for COVID-19 diagnosis. Herein, we streamlined a highly efficient CRISPR-Cas12a-based nucleic acid detection platform, termed Cas12a-linked beam unlocking reaction (CALIBURN). We show that CALIBURN could detect SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses and influenza viruses with little cross-reactivity. Importantly, CALIBURN allowed accurate diagnosis of clinical samples with extremely low viral loads, which is a major obstacle for the clinical applications of existing CRISPR diagnostic platforms. When tested on the specimens from SARS-CoV-2-positive and negative donors, CALIBURN exhibited 73.0% positive and 19.0% presumptive positive rates and 100% specificity. Moreover, unlike existing CRISPR detection methods that were mainly restricted to respiratory specimens, CALIBURN displayed consistent performance across both respiratory and nonrespiratory specimens, suggesting its broad specimen compatibility. Finally, using a mouse model of SARS-CoV-2 infection, we demonstrated that CALIBURN allowed detection of coexisting pathogens without cross-reactivity from a single tissue specimen.

674647,Psychological impact of COVID-19 pandemic on general population in West Bengal: A cross-sectional study,2020-05-15,"In this article, we reviewed and compared some of COVID-19 and pregnancy guidelines; this can be useful for pregnant women including those with a history of infertility specially those undergone assisted reproduc- tive techniques (ART). The general advice given for prenatal care is to reduce face-to-face visits. All women who refer for prenatal visits should be evaluated for signs of the infection at the time of entry. The triage of suspected women should be done separately from other patients. Outpatient monitoring with a 14-day self- quarantine can be considered for asymptomatic infected women and for those with mild symptoms. Inpatient management criteria include moderate to severe symptoms and the target level of oxygen saturation is 92 to 95% in different guidelines. In the presence of fever, it is important to conduct a thorough examination of other causes of the fever. It is important to monitor fluid intake and output, maintain fluid and electrolyte balance and prevent fluid overload. Thromboembolic prophylaxis is recommended. Corticosteroid administra- tion is based on obstetrics indications, while in critical ill cases, it should be based on multi-disciplinary teams (MDT) decision. A positive COVID-19 result in the absence of other obstetrics causes, cannot be considered an indication for delivery in mild and asymptomatic cases. In critically ill pregnant women, an individualized decision should be made about delivery time by the MDT. General anesthetic should be avoided unless inevi- table for standard procedures such as intubation is an aerosol-generating procedure (AGP). There is agreement on the point that babies born to infected mothers, even if isolated from the mother at birth, should be consid- ered a close contact of the mother and tested for COVID-19 and separated from other neonates. Breastfeeding is encouraged and hand hygiene and face mask during feeding are highly recommended by all guidelines.","Pirjani, Reihaneh; Rabiei, Maryam; Abiri, Ameneh; Moini, Ashraf",Int J Fertil Steril,https://doi.org/10.22074/ijfs.2020.46230; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33098398/,193
674964,Mental Health Impact of COVID-19 on Quarantine Hotel Employees in China,2020-11-26,"Catalytic hairpin assembly (CHA) is one of the most promising nucleic acid amplification circuits based on toehold-mediated strand exchange reactions. But its performance is usually ruined by fluctuated environmental temperatures or unexpected self-structures existing in most real-world targets. Here we present an amide-assistant mechanism that successfully reduces the prevalence of these problems for CHA and maximizes its thermo- and structure- buffering abilities. Such an organic amide-promoted CHA (shortened as OHT-CHA) can unprecedentedly amplify through 4 °C to 60 °C without rebuilding sequences or concerning target complexity. We are then for the first time able to employ it as a direct and universal signal booster for loop mediated isothermal reaction (LAMP). LAMP is one of the most promising point-of-care (POC) gene amplifiers, but has been hard to detect precisely due to structured products and haunted off-target amplicons. OHT-CHA guarantees a significant and reliable signal for LAMP reaction amplified from as little as 10(−19) M virus gene. And one single set of OHT-CHA is qualified to any detection requirement, either in real-time at LAMP running temperature (~60 °C), or at end-point on a POC photon counter only holding environmental temperatures fluctuating between 4 °C to 42 °C.","Zhu, Zhentong; Tang, Yidan; Jiang, Yu Sherry; Bhadra, Sanchita; Du, Yan; Ellington, Andrew D.; Li, Bingling",Sci Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27812041/; https://doi.org/10.1038/srep36605,193
674972,Revealing Public Opinion Towards COVID-19 Vaccines With Twitter Data in the United States: Spatiotemporal Perspective,2021-09-10,"BACKGROUND: The internet is now the first line source of health information for many people worldwide. In the current Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) global pandemic, health information is being produced, revised, updated and disseminated at an increasingly rapid rate. The general public are faced with a plethora of misinformation regarding COVID-19 and the readability of online information has an impact on their understanding of the disease. The accessibility of online healthcare information relating to COVID-19 is unknown. We sought to evaluate the readability of online information relating to COVID-19 in four English speaking regions: Ireland, the United Kingdom, Canada and the United States, and compare readability of website source provenance and regional origin. METHODS: The Google® search engine was used to collate the first 20 webpage URLs for three individual searches for ‘COVID’, ‘COVID-19’, and ‘coronavirus’ from Ireland, the United Kingdom, Canada and the United States. The Gunning Fog Index (GFI), Flesch-Kincaid Grade (FKG) Score, Flesch Reading Ease Score (FRES), Simple Measure of Gobbledygook (SMOG) score were calculated to assess the readability. RESULTS: There were poor levels of readability webpages reviewed, with only 17.2% of webpages at a universally readable level. There was a significant difference in readability between the different webpages based on their information source (p < 0.01). Public Health organisations and Government organisations provided the most readable COVID-19 material, while digital media sources were significantly less readable. There were no significant differences in readability between regions. CONCLUSION: Much of the general public have relied on online information during the pandemic. Information on COVID-19 should be made more readable, and those writing webpages and information tools should ensure universal accessibility is considered in their production. Governments and healthcare practitioners should have an awareness of the online sources of information available, and ensure that readability of our own productions is at a universally readable level which will increase understanding and adherence to health guidelines.","Worrall, Amy P.; Connolly, Mary J.; O’Neill, Aine; O’Doherty, Murray; Thornton, Kenneth P.; McNally, Cora; McConkey, Samuel J.; de Barra, Eoghan",BMC Public Health,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12889-020-09710-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33183297/,193

Financial and corporate service firms cannot only be digitally based because they also require face-to-face interaction, collaboration, and joint-production within themselves, and between one another, in the most connected global cities to effectively function as competitive businesses. However, after Covid-19 advanced service firms will only not practice remote working where and when they must; so that in-place face-to-face interactions with colleagues and clients will be overwhelmingly only concentrated in the skyscraper-laden financial districts of the world’s leading global cities. The future of commercial and luxury residential skyscrapers in the world’s leading global cities can be said to be secure because the impact of Covid-19 on enhancing the centrality of these few highly connected and super-wealthy cities in globalization is both understandable and predictable; skyscrapers elsewhere in the Global North or South will struggle to remain viable as firms increasingly decentralise the work of their staff away from city centre offices.","Smith, Richard G.",Futures,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34584275/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.futures.2021.102839; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0016328721001488; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0016328721001488,193
675766,Comparison of psychological symptoms between infected and non-infected COVID-19 health care workers,2021-03-26,"OBJECTIVE: To characterise the oral microbiome, gut microbiome and serum lipid profiles in patients with active COVID-19 and recovered patients; evaluate the potential of the microbiome as a non-invasive biomarker for COVID-19; and explore correlations between the microbiome and lipid profile. DESIGN: We collected and sequenced 392 tongue-coating samples, 172 faecal samples and 155 serum samples from Central China and East China. We characterised microbiome and lipid molecules, constructed microbial classifiers in discovery cohort and verified their diagnostic potential in 74 confirmed patients (CPs) from East China and 37 suspected patients (SPs) with IgG positivity. RESULTS: Oral and faecal microbial diversity was significantly decreased in CPs versus healthy controls (HCs). Compared with HCs, butyric acid-producing bacteria were decreased and lipopolysaccharide-producing bacteria were increased in CPs in oral cavity. The classifiers based on 8 optimal oral microbial markers (7 faecal microbial markers) achieved good diagnostic efficiency in different cohorts. Importantly, diagnostic efficacy reached 87.24% in the cross-regional cohort. Moreover, the classifiers successfully diagnosed SPs with IgG antibody positivity as CPs, and diagnostic efficacy reached 92.11% (98.01% of faecal microbiome). Compared with CPs, 47 lipid molecules, including sphingomyelin (SM)(d40:4), SM(d38:5) and monoglyceride(33:5), were depleted, and 122 lipid molecules, including phosphatidylcholine(36:4p), phosphatidylethanolamine (PE)(16:0p/20:5) and diglyceride(20:1/18:2), were enriched in confirmed patients recovery. CONCLUSION: This study is the first to characterise the oral microbiome in COVID-19, and oral microbiomes and lipid alterations in recovered patients, to explore their correlations and to report the successful establishment and validation of a diagnostic model for COVID-19.","Ren, Zhigang; Wang, Haiyu; Cui, Guangying; Lu, Haifeng; Wang, Ling; Luo, Hong; Chen, Xinhua; Ren, Hongyan; Sun, Ranran; Liu, Wenli; Liu, Xiaorui; Liu, Chao; Li, Ang; Wang, Xuemei; Rao, Benchen; Yuan, Chengyu; Zhang, Hua; Sun, Jiarui; Chen, Xiaolong; Li, Bingjie; Hu, Chuansong; Wu, Zhongwen; Yu, Zujiang; Kan, Quancheng; Li, Lanjuan",Gut,https://doi.org/10.1136/gutjnl-2020-323826; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33789966/,193

The development of an effective COVID-19 vaccine could limit the morbidity and mortality caused by infection, and may enable the relaxation of social distancing measures. Age is one of the most significant risk factors for poor health outcomes after SARS-CoV-2 infection, therefore it is desirable that any new vaccine candidates elicit a robust immune response in older adults. Methods Here, we use in-depth immunophenotyping to characterize the innate and adaptive immune response induced upon intramuscular administration of the adenoviral vectored ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (AZD-1222) COVID-19 vaccine candidate in mice. Findings A single vaccination generates spike-specific Th1 cells, Th1-like Foxp3+ regulatory T cells, polyfunctional spike-specific CD8+ T cells and granzyme B producing CD8 effectors. Spike-specific IgG and IgM are generated from both the early extrafollicular antibody response and the T follicular helper cell-supported germinal centre reaction, which is associated with the production of virus neutralising antibodies. A single dose of this vaccine generated a similar type of immune response in aged mice, but of a reduced magnitude than in younger mice. We report that a second dose enhances the immune response to this vaccine in aged mice. Conclusions This study shows that ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 induces both cellular and humoral immunity in adult and aged mice, and suggests a prime-boost strategy is a rational approach to enhance immunogenicity in older persons.

It has been previously shown that HCoV-NL63 is also one of the most important causes of croup in children. In the current manuscript we developed a set of polymer-based compounds showing prominent anticoronaviral activity. Polymers have been recently considered as promising alternatives to small molecule inhibitors, due to their intrinsic antimicrobial properties and ability to serve as matrices for antimicrobial compounds. Most of the antimicrobial polymers show antibacterial properties, while those with antiviral activity are much less frequent. A cationically modified chitosan derivative, N-(2-hydroxypropyl)-3-trimethylammonium chitosan chloride (HTCC), and hydrophobically-modified HTCC were shown to be potent inhibitors of HCoV-NL63 replication.

METHODS AND MATERIALS: A retrospective institutional review identified patients eligible for PBI based on clinicopathologic criteria, and tumor bed visualization was determined from computed tomography-planning scans. An online survey was subsequently distributed to Canadian radiation oncologists addressing the usage and added value of surgical clips for breast radiation therapy planning purposes. The survey also evaluated PBI usage and regimens. Responses were collected over a 4-week period. PBI regimen usage at our institution was also reviewed from May 1 to December 18, 2020. RESULTS: Based on clinicopathologic criteria, 306 patients were identified between 2013 and 2018 who were eligible for PBI. However, only 24% (72/306) of cases were noted to have surgical clips, of which over 50% did not assist in tumor bed localization due to inconsistent clip positioning. Similarly, nearly two-thirds (28/43) of survey respondents indicated that surgical clips are placed in the tumor bed in less than 50% of cases. Almost all respondents (42/43) indicated that surgical clips facilitate breast radiation therapy planning and favor the development of guidelines to increase the consistent placement of surgical clips in the tumor bed after breast-conserving surgery. Approximately two-thirds of respondents (28/43) offer PBI to eligible patients as routine treatment, with moderate hypofractionated regimens most commonly recommended. However, the 1-week daily regimen of 26 Gy in 5 fractions is now offered to the majority (77%) of patients at our institution. CONCLUSIONS: There was strong agreement among Canadian radiation oncologists that surgical clip placement facilitates breast radiation therapy planning, and most favor the development of surgical guidelines for the consistent placement of surgical clips in this setting. With the growing use of PBI, accurate localization of the tumor bed is extremely important.","Koch, Christine Anne; Corey, Gemma; Liu, Zhihui Amy; Han, Kathy; Fyles, Anthony",Adv Radiat Oncol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34409206/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.adro.2021.100701,193

682967,Dietary and Lifestyle Changes During COVID-19 and the Subsequent Lockdowns among Polish Adults: A Cross-Sectional Online Survey PLifeCOVID-19 Study,2020-08-03,"BACKGROUND: Lately, one of the major clinical and public health issues has been represented by Coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) during pregnancy and the risk of transmission of the infection from mother to child. Debate on perinatal management and postnatal care is still ongoing, principally questioning the option of the joint management of mother and child after birth and the safety of breastfeeding. According to the available reports, neonatal COVID-19 appears to have a horizontal transmission and seems to be paucisymptomatic or asymptomatic, compared to older age groups. The aim of this work is to describe a cluster of neonatal COVID-19 and discuss our experience, with reference to current evidence on postnatal care and perinatal management. METHODS: This is a retrospective observational case series of five mother-child dyads, who attended the Labor and Delivery Unit of a first-level hospital in Italy, in March 2020. Descriptive statistics for continuous variables consisted of number of observations, mean and the range of the minimum and maximum values. RESULTS: Five women and four neonates tested positive for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). In one case, the mother-child dyad was separated and the neonate remained negative on two consecutive tests. Two positive neonates developed symptoms, with a predominant involvement of the gastrointestinal tract. Blood tests were unremarkable, except for a single patient who developed mild neutropenia. No complications occurred. CONCLUSIONS: We agree that the decision on whether or not to separate a positive/suspected mother from her child should be made on an individual basis, taking into account the parent’s will, clinical condition, hospital logistics and the local epidemiological situation. In conformity with literature, in our study, affected neonates were asymptomatic or paucisymptomatic. Despite these reassuring findings, a few cases of severe presentation in the neonatal population have been reported. Therefore, we agree on encouraging clinicians to monitor the neonates with a suspected or confirmed infection.","Olivini, Nicole; Calò Carducci, Francesca Ippolita; Santilli, Veronica; De Ioris, Maria Antonietta; Scarselli, Alessia; Alario, Dario; Geremia, Caterina; Lombardi, Mary Haywood; Marabotto, Caterina; Mariani, Rosanna; Papa, Raffaele Edo; Peschiaroli, Emanuela; Scrocca, Raffaella; Sinibaldi, Serena; Smarrazzo, Andrea; Stella, Pietro; Bernardi, Stefania; Chiurchiù, Sara; Pansa, Paola; Romani, Lorenza; Michaela, Carletti; Concato, Carlo; De Rose, Domenico Umberto; Salvatori, Gugliemo; Rossi, Paolo; Villani, Alberto; Dotta, Andrea; D’Argenio, Patrizia; Campana, Andrea",Ital J Pediatr,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33287880/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s13052-020-00947-9,193

Asian countries and regions have their own regulations on the quality of starting cells, and these regulations are not harmonized. As cell therapy products are being developed across countries and regions, we propose a risk-based approach based on donor location, window period of virus test, and additional virus tests on the master cell bank to fill the gaps in regulation while controlling the risk of viral contamination. Moreover, a standard procedure of comparability assessment after changes in the manufacturing process of MSC-based products does not exist. The WG2 discussed points of comparability assessment specifically for MSC-based products considering the similarities and differences with parallel assessments for protein and polypeptide products, which are within the scope of the International Council for Harmonization Q5E guideline.

684861,"Predictors of Intention to Vaccinate against COVID-19 in the General Public in Hong Kong: Findings from a Population-Based, Cross-Sectional Survey",2021-06-25,"BACKGROUND: COVID-19 is still rampant all over the world. Until now, the COVID-19 vaccine is the most promising measure to subdue contagion and achieve herd immunity. However, public vaccination intention is suboptimal. A clear division lies between medical professionals and laypeople. While most professionals eagerly promote the vaccination campaign, some laypeople exude suspicion, hesitancy, and even opposition toward COVID-19 vaccines. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to employ a text mining approach to examine expression differences and thematic disparities between the professionals and laypeople within the COVID-19 vaccine context. METHODS: We collected 3196 answers under 65 filtered questions concerning the COVID-19 vaccine from the China-based question and answer forum Zhihu. The questions were classified into 5 categories depending on their contents and description: adverse reactions, vaccination, vaccine effectiveness, social implications of vaccine, and vaccine development. Respondents were also manually coded into two groups: professional and laypeople. Automated text analysis was performed to calculate fundamental expression characteristics of the 2 groups, including answer length, attitude distribution, and high-frequency words. Furthermore, structural topic modeling (STM), as a cutting-edge branch in the topic modeling family, was used to extract topics under each question category, and thematic disparities were evaluated between the 2 groups. RESULTS: Laypeople are more prevailing in the COVID-19 vaccine–related discussion. Regarding differences in expression characteristics, the professionals posted longer answers and showed a conservative stance toward vaccine effectiveness than did laypeople. Laypeople mentioned countries more frequently, while professionals were inclined to raise medical jargon. STM discloses prominent topics under each question category. Statistical analysis revealed that laypeople preferred the “safety of Chinese-made vaccine” topic and other vaccine-related issues in other countries. However, the professionals paid more attention to medical principles and professional standards underlying the COVID-19 vaccine. With respect to topics associated with the social implications of vaccines, the 2 groups showed no significant difference. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that laypeople and professionals share some common grounds but also hold divergent focuses toward the COVID-19 vaccine issue. These incongruities can be summarized as “qualitatively different” in perspective rather than “quantitatively different” in scientific knowledge. Among those questions closely associated with medical expertise, the “qualitatively different” characteristic is quite conspicuous. This study boosts the current understanding of how the public perceives the COVID-19 vaccine, in a more nuanced way.

687345,Adherence to precautions for preventing the transmission of microorganisms in primary health care: a qualitative study,2017-09-11,"INTRODUCTION: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. Although demographic and clinical parameters such as sex, age, comorbidities, genetic background and various biomarkers have been identified as risk factors, there is an unmet need to predict the risk and onset of severe inflammatory disease leading to poor clinical outcomes. In addition, very few mechanistic biomarkers are available to inform targeted treatment of severe (auto)-inflammatory conditions associated with COVID-19. Calprotectin, also known as S100A8/S100A9, MRP8/14 (Myeloid-Related Protein) or L1, is a heterodimer involved in neutrophil-related inflammatory processes. In COVID-19 patients, calprotectin levels were reported to be associated with poor clinical outcomes such as significantly reduced survival time, especially in patients with severe pulmonary disease. AREAS COVERED: Pubmed was searched using the following keywords: Calprotectin + COVID19, S100A8/A9 + COVID19, S100A8 + COVID-19, S100A9 + COVID-19, MRP8/14 + COVID19; L1 + COVID-19 between May 2020 and 8 March 2021. The results summarized in this review provide supporting evidence and propose future directions that define calprotectin as an important biomarker in COVID-19. EXPERT OPINION: Calprotectin represents a promising serological biomarker for the risk assessment of COVID-19 patients.","Mahler, Michael; Meroni, Pier-Luigi; Infantino, Maria; Buhler, Katherine A.; Fritzler, Marvin J.",Expert review of clinical immunology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33750254/; https://doi.org/10.1080/1744666x.2021.1905526,193

A systematic review is a suitable first scholarly activity because it entails summarization of publicly available data and usually requires neither rigorous ethical review nor research funding. METHODS: This study aimed to develop a model workshop for healthcare staff to acquire skills in creating systematic review protocols based on their own clinical questions at teaching hospitals. We used an action research method to create a model workshop at four hospitals in Japan from April 2015 to March 2017. To improve the program, we solicited reflections using participant questionnaires for each lecture and examined the quality of homework submitted by participants after each lecture. We administered a revised final version of the workshop at five hospitals from April 2016 to March 2017. We evaluated the participants’ scholarly productivity related to these workshops. The observation period was a minimum of 2 years following the workshops. RESULTS: Most participants had never developed a formal clinical research protocol and voluntarily participated in the workshop. The action research was developed and implemented at nine teaching hospitals in Japan, including one university hospital. The study developed a model nine-step workshop curriculum: 1) Research question development, 2) Search strategy development, 3) Search strategy brush-up, 4) Exclusion and inclusion criteria development, 5) Risk of bias assessment planning, 6) Meta-analysis planning, 7) Subgroup and sensitivity analysis planning, 8) Planning the presentation of results, and 9) Presentation protocols. A total of 233 participants, including medical doctors and other health professionals, produced 414 research questions. Seventy-nine participants (34%) completed the workshop, and 47 review teams accomplished systematic review protocols. The participants published 13 peer-reviewed articles as a result of the workshop. CONCLUSIONS: We developed a structured scholarly productive model workshop for healthcare staff working at hospitals. We found healthcare staff with clinical subspecialties were able to develop an unexpectedly high number of research questions through this workshop. Medical teachers at hospitals with prior systematic review experience could teach how to develop systematic review protocols using this model. Further research is needed to increase the academic productivity of such workshops. TRIAL REGISTRATION: UMIN (https://www.umin.ac.jp/ctr/), UMIN000017107 (4/15/2015), UMIN000025580 (1/10/2017).

Despite government’s immediate actions and strict control, more and more people were infected every day. As such a contagious virus can spread easily and rapidly between people, the whole country was put into lockdown and people were forced into isolation. In order to understand the impact of Covid-19 on mental health well-being, Chinese researchers have conducted several studies. However, no consistent results were obtained. Therefore, a meta-analysis was conducted. Methods: We searched Embase, PubMed, and Web of Science databases to find literature from December 2019 to April 2020 related to Covid-19 and mental health, among which results such as comments, letters, reviews and case reports were excluded. The incidence of anxiety and depression in the population was synthesized and discussed. Results: A total of 27,475 subjects were included in 12 studies. Random effect model is used to account for the data. The results showed that the incidence of anxiety was 25% (95% CI: 0.19–0.32), and the incidence of depression was 28% (95% CI: 0.17–0.38). Significant heterogeneity was detected across studies regarding these incidence estimates. Subgroup analysis included the study population and assessment tools, and sensitivity analysis was done to explore the sources of heterogeneity. Conclusions: Owing to the significant heterogeneity detected in studies regarding this pooled prevalence of anxiety and depression, we must interpret the results with caution. As the epidemic is ongoing, it is vital to set up a comprehensive crisis prevention system, which integrating epidemiological monitoring, screening and psychological crisis prevention and interventions.","Ren, Xin; Huang, Wanli; Pan, Huiping; Huang, Tingting; Wang, Xinwei; Ma, Yongchun",Psychiatr Q,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11126-020-09796-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32642822/,193

689148,Dental Care in the Arab Countries During the COVID-19 Pandemic: An Infodemiological Study,2021-05-24,"The aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) is a cytoplasmic receptor/transcription factor that modulates several cellular and immunological processes following activation by pathogen-associated stimuli, though its role during virus infection is largely unknown. Here, we show that AhR is activated in cells infected with mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), a coronavirus (CoV), and contributes to the upregulation of downstream effector TCDD-inducible poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (TiPARP) during infection. Knockdown of TiPARP reduced viral replication and increased interferon expression, suggesting that TiPARP functions in a proviral manner during MHV infection. We also show that MHV replication induced the expression of other genes known to be downstream of AhR in macrophages and dendritic cells and in livers of infected mice. Further, we found that chemically inhibiting or activating AhR reciprocally modulated the expression levels of cytokines induced by infection, specifically, interleukin 1β (IL-1β), IL-10, and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), consistent with a role for AhR activation in the host response to MHV infection. Furthermore, while indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO1) drives AhR activation in other settings, MHV infection induced equal expression of downstream genes in wild-type (WT) and IDO1(−/−) macrophages, suggesting an alternative pathway of AhR activation. In summary, we show that coronaviruses elicit AhR activation by an IDO1-independent pathway, contributing to upregulation of downstream effectors, including the proviral factor TiPARP, and to modulation of cytokine gene expression, and we identify a previously unappreciated role for AhR signaling in CoV pathogenesis. IMPORTANCE Coronaviruses are a family of positive-sense RNA viruses with human and agricultural significance. Characterizing the mechanisms by which coronavirus infection dictates pathogenesis or counters the host immune response would provide targets for the development of therapeutics. Here, we show that the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) is activated in cells infected with a prototypic coronavirus, mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), resulting in the expression of several effector genes. AhR is important for modulation of the host immune response to MHV and plays a role in the expression of TiPARP, which we show is required for maximal viral replication. Taken together, our findings highlight a previously unidentified role for AhR in regulating coronavirus replication and the immune response to the virus.","Grunewald, Matthew E.; Shaban, Mohamed G.; Mackin, Samantha R.; Fehr, Anthony R.; Perlman, Stanley",J Virol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31694960/; https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.01743-19,193
689416,Screening for and Managing the Person with Frailty in Primary Care: ICFSR Consensus Guidelines,2020-10-17,"Abstract To deal with the Covid 19 pandemic, health protection measures require changes to our clinical practices. Faced up with the unprecedented nature of this situation, the liberal psychotherapist is led to rethink some aspects of the framework of his practice in order to preserve the thread of the transferential relationship. The authors develop a clinical reflection on the clinical setting in a pandemic period by exploring in particular the dynamics of telephone sessions. For telephone interviews, the question of the sound envelope is central, in particular regarding the psychic function of silence. We choose to illustrate our point with short vignettes than by relying on long-term clinical cases, more likely to represent the variety of new clinical situations encountered and the questions that accompany them. This article introduces his point by recounting the plague epidemic in ancient Greece to show the impact of the environment on humans and its collective fantasy implications. Being faced up with death, contamination, the invisible enemy brings out a palpable concern. It is indeed quite remarkable that these same reactions and concerns in front of death caused by the pandemic match whith what is related by Thucydides who survived the plague which affected Athens during the Peloponnesian War. In another context, Winnicott highlights the place and importance of the therapeutic environment. It is both a question of adjusting the framework according to the context while maintaining certain intangible aspects representing the permanence of the link and its framework. A framework cannot exist without being kept, which is equivalent to thinking of the framework above all as an internal framework, questioning the clinician about what he values and what he makes sense in his practice. In the current context, these questions arise from the perspective of a certain flexibility, depending on the human context (child, adolescent, consultations, etc.) or external context (crisis linked to a virus, etc.) showing that it is more than never question of exercising on a case-by-case basis, taking into account changes in the environment. The initial observation during this period of confinement concerns the fact that some patients contact a therapist for the first time by telephone and wish to initiate psychotherapy (during this period) when they explain that such an initiative was not possible. despite the difficulties already encountered in the past. But there is also the opposite case: patients who have no intention of continuing the work already started during this time. Thus, faced up with the injunction of confinement, they show themselves in the psychic impossibility of following the treatment by other means such as, for example, telephone sessions. In this perspective, the silence on the phone takes on a different tone; silence reveals itself to be a source of greater anxiety than in presence: the presence of bodies, of its movements perceptible as imperceptible, of a gesture that carries or accompanies the senses, breathing, the visual context of the office and of its ""decor"", represent as many essential elements in the usual capacity of the frame; in the absence of these basic sensory elements, silence can be experienced as a void, or even a gap in the bond, opening Pandora’s box of paranoid fantasies acting unconsciously.If silence is representative of the whole framework, it promotes in this context the partialization of the clinician’s body reduced to one ear and not to a whole body. Here, it is the change of framework that mobilizes the difference, established by Mr. Klein, between the partial and total object; this circumstance neo-framework could therefore call for regressive movements, undoing the silence of its symbolic function when the bodies are present.","Houssier, Florent; Christaki, Angélique; Vlachopoulou, Xanthie",Ann Med Psychol (Paris),https://doi.org/10.1016/j.amp.2020.06.002; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0003448720301815; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32836301/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003448720301815?v=s5,193

It is a hazardous disease that has recently become the biggest crisis in the modern era. Due to the limitation of test kits and the need for screening and rapid diagnosis of patients, it is essential to perform a self-operating detection model as a fast recognition system to detect COVID-19 infection and prevent the spread among the people. In this paper, we propose a novel technique called Fast COVID-19 Detector (FCOD) to have a fast detection of COVID-19 using X-ray images. The FCOD is a deep learning model based on the Inception architecture that uses 17 depthwise separable convolution layers to detect COVID-19. Depthwise separable convolution layers decrease the computation costs, time, and they can have a reducing role in the number of parameters compared to the standard convolution layers. To evaluate FCOD, we used covid-chestxray-dataset, which contains 940 publicly available typical chest X-ray images. Our results show that FCOD can provide accuracy, F1-score, and AUC of 96%, 96%, and 0.95%, respectively in classifying COVID-19 during 0.014 s for each case. The proposed model can be employed as a supportive decision-making system to assist radiologists in clinics and hospitals to screen patients immediately.","Panahi, Amir Hossein; Rafiei, Alireza; Rezaee, Alireza",Inform Med Unlocked,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352914820306572; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.imu.2020.100506; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2352914820306572; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33392388/,193

The strict lockdown and quarantine affect the psychological state of people toward cryptocurrency. The current research aims to examine the effect of COVID-19 on Bitcoin prices concerning cumulative deaths and confirmed cases. The research comprises daily data from January 20, 2020, to April 30, 2020, during the initial worldwide breakout of COVID-19. This research employed the augmented Dickey-Fuller test to check the stationarity of data, the co-integration test for the interdependency of variables, and the vector error correction model for identifying the direction and long or short-run relationship between Bitcoin prices and COVID-19. The research results show that Bitcoin prices are negatively significant and related to COVID-19 in the short-run. A unidirectional relationship between Bitcoin prices and cumulative deaths is also observed. Investors and the public’s psychological state were positively significant to Bitcoin prices in the long-term because of cashless transactions, unbanked, and less risky virus traveling. The second reason behind the positive psychological relation is un-centralization and easy-to-make payments by Bitcoin.

Hence, reckoning therapeutics for the S-RBD of SARS-CoV-2 may address a significant way to target viral entry into the host cells. Herein, through in-silico approaches (Molecular docking, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, and end-state thermodynamics), we aimed to screen natural molecules from different plants for their ability against S-RBD of SARS-CoV-2. We prioritized the best interacting molecules (Diacetylcurcumin and Dicaffeoylquinic acid) by analysis of protein-ligand interactions and subjected them for long-term MD simulations. We found that Dicaffeoylquinic acid interacted prominently with essential residues (Lys417, Gln493, Tyr489, Phe456, Tyr473, and Glu484) of S-RBD. These residues are involved in interactions between S-RBD and ACE2 and could inhibit the viral entry into the host cells. The in-silico analyses indicated that Dicaffeoylquinic acid and Diacetylcurcumin might have potential to act as inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD. The present study warrants further in-vitro and in-vivo studies of Dicaffeoylquinic acid and Diacetylcurcumin for validation and acceptance of their inhibitory potential against S-RBD of SARS-CoV-2.","Singh, Rahul; Bhardwaj, Vijay Kumar; Sharma, Jatin; Kumar, Dinesh; Purohit, Rituraj",Comput Biol Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34273770/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.compbiomed.2021.104631; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S001048252100425X?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S001048252100425X,193

Coexisting CVD may influence the prognosis of patients with COVID-19. AIMS: We analyzed the impact of CVD and the use of cardiovascular drugs on the in-hospital course and mortality of patients with COVID-19. METHODS: We retrospectively studied data for consecutive patients admitted to our hospital, with COVID-19 between March 6th and October 15th, 2020. RESULTS: 1729 patients (median interquartile range age 63 [50-75] years; women 48.8%) were included. Overall, in-hospital mortality was 12.9%. The most prevalent CVD was arterial hypertension (56.1%), followed by hyperlipidemia (27.4%), diabetes mellitus (DM) (25.7%), coronary artery disease (16.8%), heart failure (HF) (10.3%), atrial fibrillation (13.5%), and stroke (8%). Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers (ACEIs/ARBs) were used in 25.0% of patients, ß-blockers in 40.7%, statins in 15.6%, and antiplatelet therapy in 19.9%.
