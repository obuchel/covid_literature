2268,2268,2268,Ad Hoc Influenza Vaccination During Years of Significant Antigenic Drift in a Tropical City With 2 Seasonal Peaks: A Cross-Sectional Survey Among Health Care Practitioners,21.672424,5.1756544,2016-05-13,"We evaluated the acceptability of an additional ad hoc influenza vaccination among the health care professionals following seasons with significant antigenic drift. Self-administered, anonymous surveys were performed by hard copy questionnaires in public hospitals, and by an on-line platform available to all healthcare professionals, from April 1st to May 31st, 2015. A total of 1290 healthcare professionals completed the questionnaires, including doctors, nurses, and allied health professionals working in both the public and private systems. Only 31.8% of participating respondents expressed an intention to receive the additional vaccine, despite that the majority of them agreed or strongly agreed that it would bring benefit to the community (88.9%), save lives (86.7%), reduce medical expenses (76.3%), satisfy public expectation (82.8%), and increase awareness of vaccination (86.1%). However, a significant proportion expressed concern that the vaccine could disturb the normal immunization schedule (45.5%); felt uncertain what to do in the next vaccination round (66.0%); perceived that the summer peak might not occur (48.2%); and believed that the summer peak might not be of the same virus (83.5%). Furthermore, 27.8% of all respondents expected that the additional vaccination could weaken the efficacy of previous vaccinations; 51.3% was concerned about side effects; and 61.3% estimated that there would be a low uptake rate. If the supply of vaccine was limited, higher priority groups were considered to include the elderly aged ≥65 years with chronic medical conditions (89.2%), the elderly living in residential care homes (87.4%), and long-stay residents of institutions for the disabled (80.7%). The strongest factors associated with accepting the additional vaccine included immunization with influenza vaccines in the past 3 years, higher perceived risk of contracting influenza, and higher perceived severity of the disease impact. The acceptability to an additional ad hoc influenza vaccination was low among healthcare professionals. This could have a negative impact on such additional vaccination campaigns since healthcare professionals are a key driver for vaccine acceptance. The discordance in perceived risk and acceptance of vaccination regarding self versus public deserves further evaluation.","Wong, Martin C.S.; Nelson, E.

Infusion of natural killer (NK) cells is an emerging immunotherapy for such malignant tumors, although elimination of the immunosuppressive tumor environment is required to improve its efficacy. The effects of this “metastatic” tumor environment on NK cells, however, remain largely unknown. Previous studies, including our own, have demonstrated that metastasis-associated macrophages (MAMs) are one of the most abundant immune cell types in the metastatic tumor niche in mouse models of metastatic breast cancer. We thus investigated the effects of MAMs on antitumor functions of NK cells in the metastatic tumor microenvironment. METHODS: MAMs were isolated from the tumor-bearing lung of C57BL/6 mice intravenously injected with E0771-LG mouse mammary tumor cells. The effects of MAMs on NK cell cytotoxicity towards E0771-LG cells were evaluated in vitro by real-time fluorescence microscopy. The effects of MAM depletion on NK cell activation, maturation, and accumulation in the metastatic lung were evaluated by flow cytometry (CD69, CD11b, CD27) and in situ hybridization (Ncr1) using colony-stimulating factor 1 (CSF-1) receptor conditional knockout (Csf1r-cKO) mice. Finally, metastatic tumor loads in the chest region of mice were determined by bioluminescence imaging in order to evaluate the effect of MAM depletion on therapeutic efficacy of endogenous and adoptively transferred NK cells in suppressing metastatic tumor growth. RESULTS: MAMs isolated from the metastatic lung suppressed NK cell-induced tumor cell apoptosis in vitro via membrane-bound transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) dependent mechanisms. In the tumor-challenged mice, depletion of MAMs increased the percentage of activated (CD69(+)) and mature (CD11b(+)CD27(–)) NK cells and the number of Ncr1(+) NK cells as well as NK cell-mediated tumor rejection in the metastatic site. Moreover, MAM depletion or TGF-β receptor antagonist treatment significantly enhanced the therapeutic efficacy of NK cell infusion in suppressing early metastatic tumor outgrowth. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that MAMs are a main negative regulator of NK cell function within the metastatic tumor niche, and MAM targeting is an attractive strategy to improve NK cell-based immunotherapy for metastatic breast cancer.","Brownlie, Demi; Doughty-Shenton, Dahlia; YH Soong, Daniel; Nixon, Colin; O Carragher, Neil; M Carlin, Leo; Kitamura, Takanori",J Immunother Cancer,349,5

It is associated with a substantial increase in mortality rate. The disease has been associated with invasive group A Streptococcus and is rarely caused by Streptococcus mitis (S. mitis). In healthy adults, S. mitis is closely related to endocarditis but rarely related to STSS. CASE PRESENTATION: We report a case of STSS caused by S. mitis in a healthy 45-year-old woman. She presented with fever 14 h after surgery and with hypotension 24 h later, and she subsequently suffered from septic shock, low albumin, dysfunction of coagulation, acute kidney dysfunction, respiratory alkalosis and metabolic acidosis, acute respiratory distress syndrome and cellulitis of the incision. The diagnosis was obtained through clinical manifestation and blood culture examination. The patient was treated with aggressive fluid resuscitation, adequate antibiotics for a total of 4 weeks, respiratory support, and surgical debridement and drainage of the incision. She was discharged after her vital signs returned to normal and the incision healed on day 40 after surgery. CONCLUSIONS: The diagnosis of STSS is often delayed or missed, which leads to a high mortality rate. It is possible to cure patients if the disease can be identified early and treated with aggressive fluid resuscitation, adequate antibiotics and control of the source of infection. Clinicians should consider the disease in the differential diagnosis of septic shock to prevent death.","Chen, Xiang; Gong, Ying Ying; Zhang, Li",BMC Infect Dis,349,22

Although TCE exposure is prevalent, epidemiological studies of TCE exposure associations with adverse birth outcomes are inconclusive. Prior studies show that the TCE metabolite S-(1,2-dichlorovinyl)-l-cysteine (DCVC) exhibits toxicity in a placental cell line. In the current study, genome-wide gene expression and gene set enrichment analyses were used to identify novel genes and pathway alterations in the HTR-8/SVneo human trophoblast cell line and human placental villous explants treated with DCVC at concentrations relevant to human exposures. In the cells, concentration- and time-dependent effects were observed, as evidenced by the magnitude of altered gene expression after treatment with 20 µM DCVC versus 10 µM, and 12-h versus 6-h of treatment. Comparing the two models for the transcriptional response to 12-h 20 µM DCVC treatment, no differentially expressed genes reached significance in villous explants, whereas 301 differentially expressed genes were detected in HTR-8/SVneo cells compared with non-treated controls (FDR < 0.05 + LogFC > 0.35 [FC > 1.3]). GSEA revealed five upregulated enriched pathways in common between explants and cells (FDR < 0.05). Moreover, all 12-h DCVC treatment groups from both models contained upregulated pathways enriched for genes regulated by the ATF4 transcription factor. The overrepresentation of ATF4 regulation of differentially expressed genes indicated activation of the integrated stress response (ISR), a condition triggered by multiple stress stimuli, including the unfolded protein response. DCVC-induced ISR activation was confirmed by elevated eIF2α phosphorylation, ATF4 protein concentrations, and decreased global protein synthesis in HTR-8/SVneo cells. This study identifies a mechanism of DCVC-induced cytotoxicity by revealing the involvement of a specific stress signaling pathway.

This paper investigates how chronic illness shapes livelihood structure and income generation in rural China. Our sample consists of 3850 rural households in Southern China and we rely on instrumental variable regressions to identify causal effects. We find that farmers with chronic illness tend to diversify towards local off-farm employments, rather than migrants, since local off-farm employments are more likely to act in a strategically complementary way to farming. Further analysis shows that income returns of diversification tend to be substantially higher for the health-impaired. While the relationship between diversification and income presents a conventional inverted U shape for the healthy, it is best categorized as upward sloping with diminishing marginal effects for farmers with chronic illness.","Liao, Wenmei; Wang, Jiawei; Lin, Ying; Wang, Yao",Int J Environ Res Public Health,349,22

In the past, the standard of care for patients with a positive sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) was a completion lymph node dissection (CLND), while patients with palpable macroscopic nodal disease underwent a therapeutic lymphadenectomy in cases with no evidence of systemic spread. However, studies have shown that SLN metastases present as a spectrum of disease, with certain SLN-based factors being prognostic of and correlated with outcomes. Furthermore, the results of key clinical trials demonstrate that CLND provides no survival benefit over nodal observation in positive SLN patients, while other clinical trials have shown that adjuvant immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy or targeted therapy after CLND is associated with a recurrence-free survival benefit. Given the efficacy of these systemic therapies in the adjuvant setting, these agents are now being evaluated and utilized as neoadjuvant treatments in patients with regionally-localized or resectable metastatic melanoma. Multiple options now exist to treat melanoma patients with nodal disease, and determining the best treatment course for a particular case requires an in-depth knowledge of current data and an informed discussion with the patient. This review will provide an overview of the various options for treating melanoma patients with nodal metastases and will discuss the data that supported the development of these treatment options.","Han, Dale; van Akkooi, Alexander C.

Despite insights gained from both human and animal studies, our understanding of NAFLD pathogenesis remains limited. To better study the molecular changes driving the condition we aimed to generate a humanised NAFLD mouse model. METHODS: We generated TIRF (transgene-free Il2rg(-/-)/Rag2(-/-)/Fah(-/-)) mice, populated their livers with human hepatocytes, and fed them a Western-type diet for 12 weeks. RESULTS: Within the same chimeric liver, human hepatocytes developed pronounced steatosis whereas murine hepatocytes remained normal. Unbiased metabolomics and lipidomics revealed signatures of clinical NAFLD. Transcriptomic analyses showed that molecular responses diverged sharply between murine and human hepatocytes, demonstrating stark species differences in liver function. Regulatory network analysis indicated close agreement between our model and clinical NAFLD with respect to transcriptional control of cholesterol biosynthesis. CONCLUSIONS: These NAFLD xenograft mice reveal an unexpected degree of evolutionary divergence in food metabolism and offer a physiologically relevant, experimentally tractable model for studying the pathogenic changes invoked by steatosis. LAY SUMMARY: Fatty liver disease is an emerging health problem, and as there are no good experimental animal models, our understanding of the condition is poor. We here describe a novel humanised mouse system and compare it with clinical data. The results reveal that the human cells in the mouse liver develop fatty liver disease upon a Western-style fatty diet, whereas the mouse cells appear normal. The molecular signature (expression profiles) of the human cells are distinct from the mouse cells and metabolic analysis of the humanised livers mimic the ones observed in humans with fatty liver. This novel humanised mouse system can be used to study human fatty liver disease.","Bissig-Choisat, Beatrice; Alves-Bezerra, Michele; Zorman, Barry; Ochsner, Scott A.; Barzi, Mercedes; Legras, Xavier; Yang, Diane; Borowiak, Malgorzata; Dean, Adam M.; York, Robert B.; Galvan, N.

It is also a thrombo-inflammatory condition associated with vascular leakage/hemorrhage and thrombosis that is not effectively treated by current anti-inflammatory or anti-thrombotic drugs. Here, we show that MB2mP6 peptide nanoparticles, targeting the Gα(13)-mediated integrin “outside-in” signaling in leukocytes and platelets, inhibited both inflammation and thrombosis without causing hemorrhage/vascular leakage. MB2mP6 improved mouse survival when infused immediately or hours after onset of severe sepsis. Furthermore, platelet Gα(13) knockout inhibited septic thrombosis whereas leukocyte Gα(13) knockout diminished septic inflammation, each moderately improving survival. Dual platelet/leukocyte Gα(13) knockout inhibited septic thrombosis and inflammation, further improving survival similar to MB2mP6. These results demonstrate that inflammation and thrombosis independently contribute to poor outcomes and exacerbate each other in systemic inflammation, and reveal a concept of dual anti-inflammatory/anti-thrombotic therapy without exacerbating vascular leakage.","Cheng, Ni; Zhang, Yaping; Delaney, M.

Neurological diseases, whether traumatic, neoplastic, ischemic, metabolic, toxic, infectious, autoimmune, developmental, or degenerative, involve direct and indirect immune-related neuroinflammation. Brain infiltrates of the innate and adaptive immune system cells appear in response to an infective or otherwise noxious agent and produce inflammatory mediators. Mediators of inflammation include local and recruited cells and signals. Processes derived from extrinsic and intrinsic CNS diseases also elicit the CNS inflammatory response. A deeper understanding of immune-related inflammation in health and disease is necessary to find potential therapeutic targets for preventing or reducing CNS damage.

Therefore, an unsupervised water scene dehazing network using atmospheric multiple scattering model is proposed. Unlike previous image dehazing methods, our method uses the unsupervised neural network and the atmospheric multiple scattering model and solves the problem of difficult acquisition of ideal datasets and the effect of multiple scattering on the image. In our method, in order to embed the atmospheric multiple scattering model into the unsupervised dehazing network, the unsupervised dehazing network uses four branches to estimate the scene radiation layer, transmission map layer, blur kernel layer and atmospheric light layer, the hazy image is then synthesized from the four output layers, minimizing the input hazy image and the output hazy image, where the output scene radiation layer is the final dehazing image. In addition, we constructed unsupervised loss functions which applicable to image dehazing by prior knowledge, i.e., color attenuation energy loss and dark channel loss. The method has a wide range of applications, with haze being thick and variable in marine, river and lake scenes, the method can be used to assist ship vision for target detection or forward road recognition in hazy conditions. Through extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world images, the proposed method is able to recover the details, structure and texture of the water image better than five advanced dehazing methods.","An, Shunmin; Huang, Xixia; Wang, Linling; Zheng, Zhangjing; Wang, Le",PLoS One,349,22

Digital communication interventions that enable patients to report their symptoms have been shown to positively impact chronic disease management by improving access to care, patient-provider communication, clinical outcomes, and health-related quality of life. These interventions have the potential to prepare patients and health care providers (HCPs) before visits and improve patient-provider communication. Despite the recent rapid development and increasing number of digital communication interventions that have shown positive research results, barriers to realizing the benefits offered through these types of interventions still exist. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to prepare for the implementation of a digital patient-provider communication intervention in the daily workflow at 2 outpatient clinics by identifying potential determinants of implementation using the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR) to tailor the use of digital communication intervention to the intended context and identify key aspects for an implementation plan. METHODS: A combination of focus groups, workshops, and project steering committee meetings was conducted with HCPs (n=14) and patients (n=2) from 2 outpatient clinics at a university hospital. The CFIR was used to guide data collection and analysis. Transcripts, written minutes, and notes were analyzed and coded into 5 CFIR domains using thematic analysis. RESULTS: Data were examined and analyzed into 18 CFIR constructs relevant to the study purpose. On the basis of the identified determinants, important intervention tailoring includes adjustments to the digital features and adjustments to fit the clinical workflow and a decision to conduct a future pilot study. Furthermore, it was decided to provide the intervention to patients as early as possible in their disease trajectory, with tailored information about its use. Key aspects for the implementation plan encompassed maintaining the identified engagement and positive attitude, involving key stakeholders in the implementation process, and providing the needed support and training. CONCLUSIONS: This study offers insight into the involvement of stakeholders in the tailoring and implementation planning of a digital communication intervention in clinical practice. Stakeholder involvement in the identification of implementation facilitators and barriers can contribute to the tailoring of digital communication interventions and how they are used and can also inform systematic and targeted implementation planning.","Seljelid, Berit; Varsi, Cecilie; Solberg Nes, Lise; Øystese, Kristin Astrid; Børøsund, Elin",J Med Internet Res,349,22

After decades of research, the chemical family of this compound still remains unclear, mainly because structural studies were impaired by the presence of co-extracted compounds in marennine isolates. To improve the purity of marennine extract, we developed a novel extraction method using a graphitic stationary phase, which provides various advantages over the previous procedure using tandem ultrafiltration. Our method is faster, more versatile, provides a better crude yield (66%, compared to 57% for ultrafiltration) and is amenable to upscaling with continuous photobioreactor cultivation. Our goal was to take advantage of the modulable surface properties of the graphitic matrix by optimizing its interactions with marennine. As such, the effects of organic modifiers, pH and reducing agents were studied. With this improvement on marennine purification, we achieved altogether the isolation of a fucoidan-related, sulfated polysaccharide from blue water. Characterization of the polysaccharides fraction suggests that roughly half of UV-absorbing compounds could be isolated from the marennine crude extracts. The identification of sulfated polysaccharides could be a major breakthrough for marennine purification, providing targeted isolation techniques. Likewise, the added value of Haslea ostrearia and the role of polysaccharides in previous marennine chemical characterization and bioactivity studies remain to be determined.","Bélanger, William; Arnold, Alexandre A.; Turcotte, François; Saint-Louis, Richard; Deschênes, Jean-Sébastien; Genard, Bertrand; Marcotte, Isabelle; Tremblay, Réjean",Mar Drugs,349,1

The mean age and diabetes duration were 46.3 ± 11.9 years and 31.8 ± 26.5 months, respectively. The mean preoperative vs postoperative 12-month assessment was as such: BMI 29.3 ± 0.9 vs 23.9 ± 0.9 kg/m2, FPG 8.4 ± 3.1 vs 5.6 ± 0.7 mmol/L, HbA1c 8.3 ± 1.8 vs 5.9 ± 0.7%, insulin 103.9 ± 47.4 vs 53.9 ± 13.1 pmol/L, C-peptide 1.90 ± 1.22 vs 1.08 ± 0.44 ng/ml, and HOMA-IR 5.5 ± 4.0 vs 1.9 ± 0.6, all reached statistical significance (p value < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS In short-term, and also under strict selection criteria, SG can result in both improvement and remission of T2DM in patients with BMI 27.5-30 kg/m2. Larger sample size and longer follow-up duration will be needed in the future.","Widjaja, Jason; Pan, Haixing; Dolo, Ponnie Robertlee; Yao, Libin; Li, Chao; Shao, Yong; Zhu, Xiaocheng",Obesity surgery,349,28

Patients with lymphedema suffer a low quality of life. In our study, we aim to provide a systematic review of the current data on patient outcomes regarding breast cancer-related lymphedema (BCRL), and the most prevalent reconstructive techniques. METHODS A PubMed (MEDLINE) and Scopus literature search was performed in September 2020. Studies were screened based on inclusion/exclusion criteria. The protocol was registered at the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO), and it was reported in line with the PRISMA statement (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses). RESULTS The search yielded 254 papers from 2010 to 2020. 67 were included in our study. Lymphaticovenous anastomosis (LVA)-a minimally invasive procedure diverting the lymph into the dermal venous drainage system-combined with postoperative bandaging and compression garments yields superior results with minimal donor site lymphedema morbidity. Vascularized lymph node transfer (VLNT)-another microsurgical technique, often combined with autologous free flap breast reconstruction-improves lymphedema and brachial plexus neuropathies, and reduces the risk of cellulitis. The combination of LVA and VLNT or with other methods maximizes their effectiveness. Vascularized lymph vessel transfer (VLVT) consists of harvesting certain lymph vessels, sparing the donor site's lymph nodes. CONCLUSION Together with integrated lymphedema therapy, proper staging, and appropriate selection of procedure, safe and efficient surgical techniques can be beneficial to many patients with BCRL.","Gasteratos, Konstantinos; Morsi-Yeroyannis, Antonios; Vlachopoulos, Nikolaos Ch; Spyropoulou, Georgia-Alexandra; Del Corral, Gabriel; Chaiyasate, Kongkrit",Breast cancer,349,24

However, hydrogen ions usually exist in the form of hydronium ion (H3O+) because of its high dehydration energy; the choice of electrode materials is thus greatly limited to open frameworks and layered structures with large ionic channels. Here, the desolvation of H3O+ is achieved by using anatase TiO2 as anodes, enabling the H+ intercalation with a strain-free characteristic. Density functional theory calculations show that the desolvation effects are dependent on the facets of anatase TiO2. Anatase TiO2 (001) surface, a highly reactive surface, impels the desolvation of H3O+ into H+. When coupled with a MnO2 cathode, the proton battery delivers a high specific energy of 143.2 Wh/kg at an ultrahigh specific power of 47.9 kW/kg.

Although AWMSG conducts other activities (e.g., health technology appraisal for medicines), we focus here on its role in advising on medicines optimisation. METHODS Prescribing Indicators have been used in Wales to measure change, together with data on volumes and costs of medicines dispensed. A range of improvement strategies have been categorised under the ""four Es"", namely educational initiatives, economic incentives, ""engineering"" and ""enforcement"". RESULTS AWMSG has helped health professionals in NHS Wales to reduce harm and waste, and to reduce inappropriate local or regional duplication and variation. Specific initiatives include the achievement of major cost savings by supporting increased generic prescribing and an ""invest to save"" approach related to prescribing of hypnotics and tranquillisers, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and proton pump inhibitors. AWMSG also successfully commissioned the introduction of a single national in-patient medication chart for Wales in 2004. Ongoing priorities include a focus on reducing prescribing of certain medicines deemed ""low value for prescribing"" and on optimising the use of biosimilar medicines. CONCLUSION Since 2002, AWMSG has acted as a national medicines optimisation committee in Wales. From the outset, pharmacists and clinical pharmacologists have collaborated closely and shared their complementary expertise to make a much greater contribution to the safe, effective, and cost-effective use of medicines than either group could have achieved by working separately.","Haines, Kathryn; Bracchi, Robert; Lang, Ruth; Samuels, Karen; Routledge, Philip A",British journal of clinical pharmacology,349,1

This study aimed to summarize the chest imaging characteristics of pediatric COVID-19 cases and provide a reference for the diagnosis and control of pediatric COVID-19. Methods The study protocol was registered in PROSPERO, number CRD42020177391. Studies related to pediatric COVID-19 imaging manifestations were accessed from PubMed, Web of Science, and the Cochrane library databases, without language limitations. The publication date was limited to April 1, 2020, and it was updated on May 1 and May 27, 2020. Data normalization was determined with the Freeman-Tukey double arcsine transformation. Summarized incidences with 95% confidence intervals of various imaging manifestations were assessed by random-effects models. Heterogeneity was assessed with meta-regression and subgroup analyses, robustness with sensitivity analyses; and publication biases with Egger's test. Results Twenty-three with 517 cases were included in this study. The summarized incidence of chest computed tomography abnormalities in pediatric COVID-19 cases was 70%, which was lower than what has been seen in adults. The incidence of halo signs in pediatric COVID-19 cases was 26%, which is rarely seen in adult COVID-19 cases. The incidences of ground-glass opacities (GGOs), GGOs and consolidations, consolidations, reverse halo signs, crazy paving signs, pleural effusion, bronchopneumonia-like signs, air bronchograms, and increased lung markings were 40%, 25%, 10%, 2%, 4%, 1%, 15%, 12%, and 31%, respectively. Pericardial effusions were found in the computed tomography images of adult COVID-19 cases but were scarcely seen in the computed tomography images of pediatric COVID-19 cases. The incidences of bilateral lesions, unilateral lesions, and peripheral lesions were 35%, 22%, and 26%, respectively. Conclusions Chest computed tomography imaging of pediatric COVID-19 cases resulted in various abnormalities that were milder than those of adults. This study will hopefully provide a reference to help identify pediatric COVID-19 cases.","Zang, Si-Tian; Han, Xu; Cui, Qi; Chang, Qing; Wu, Qi-Jun; Zhao, Yu-Hong",Translational pediatrics,349,1

In October 2020, the Japanese law on immunization was revised, which resulted in a few laudable achievements. First, rotavirus vaccines were added to the NIP, 10 years after their introduction, and noteworthy studies of vaccine effectiveness and the incidence of intussusception in Japanese children were published. Second, rules on vaccine intervals-which had been a longstanding concern-were withdrawn. In addition to this revision of the law, the Japanese version of the Vaccine Information Statement (VIS) was released by the Japan Pediatric Society in 2018. The VIS provides useful caregiver information on general immunization concepts and individual vaccines. Further challenges for the Japanese immunization program include (1) administering a booster dose of pertussis-containing vaccine to preschool children or teenagers, (2) reestablishing the active recommendation for human papilloma virus vaccines, (3) adding the mumps and influenza vaccines to the NIP, and (4) ensuring optimal dosing of seasonal influenza vaccines. During the current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, vaccination rates among children have been decreasing in many countries. In Japan, vaccination rates have been stable in infants, but declining among toddlers and school-aged children, despite public awareness of the need for timely administration of vaccines during the pandemic. Clearly, further action is needed if we are to adequately protect children living in Japan from vaccine-preventable diseases.","Saitoh, Akihiko; Okabe, Nobuhiko",Vaccine,349,30

PRESENTATION OF CASE A 35-year-old female underwent routine laparoscopic cholecystectomy for recurrent intermittent right upper quadrant pain which had persisted for three months and was worse post prandial with associated nausea. Abdominal ultrasound prior to surgery was reported by a consultant radiologist as demonstrating a thin-walled gallbladder and cholelithiasis, without features of cholecystitis. At four-week review, she had recovered well with no concerns. The histopathology report revealed fibromuscular hyperplasia and patchy chronic inflammation. Rokitansky-Aschoff sinuses were present and cholesterosis was noted. Additionally, there was a focus of eroded mucosa showing adherent microlithiasis with an incidental focus of heterotopic ossification within the mucosa, there was no evidence of dysplasia or malignancy. DISCUSSION Gallbladder heterotopic ossification is exceedingly rare, with few cases reported. To our knowledge this is the first reported case in Australia. CONCLUSION In conclusion, we report the rare and unusual finding of heterotopic ossification of the gallbladder, and suspect that inflammation secondary to calculous debris initiated the ossification. Current technical limitations preclude diagnosis prior to surgery. Appropriate follow-up is unclear, but we feel a single report associated the finding with adenocarcinoma was sufficient to warrant follow-up.","Laurens, Jason Russell; Frankel, Adam; Lambie, Duncan",International journal of surgery case reports,349,8

The aim of the present study was to clarify the effect of SEMS and TDT on long-term oncological outcomes. Methods We retrospectively analyzed 76 consecutive pathological stage II and III OCRC patients who were inserted with SEMS or TDT as a bridge to curative surgery between 2009 and 2018. Results There were 53 SEMS cases and 23 TDT cases. The tumor was located in the left colon in 58 cases and in the right colon in 18 cases. The interval between the decompression and the surgery was 16.5 days in the SEMS group and 13.0 days in the TDT group (P = 0.09). Technical and clinical success rates were 100% and 100% for SEMS, and 95% and 91% for TDT, respectively. Stoma was created in four patients in the SEMS group, and in five in the TDT group (P = 0.08). Three-year overall survival rates of the SEMS and TDT groups were 82% and 86% (P = 0.94), and disease-free survival rates were 68% and 62% (P = 0.79), respectively.

We conducted a study in adults with symptoms suggestive of TB in India, Uganda, and Peru to establish the feasibility of using TB-LAMP (Eiken Chemical Co.) in microscopy laboratories compared with using smear microscopy against a reference standard of solid and liquid cultures. Operational characteristics were evaluated as well. A total of 1,777 participants met the eligibility criteria and were included for analysis. Overall, TB-LAMP sensitivities among culture-positive samples were 97.2% (243/250; 95% confidence interval [CI], 94.3% to 98.2%) and 62.0% (88/142; 95% CI, 53.5% to 70.0%) for smear-positive and smear-negative TB, respectively, but varied widely by country and operator.

While many individuals comply with these recommendations, compliance has been far from universal. Identifying predictors of compliance is crucial for improving health-behavior messaging and thereby reducing disease spread and fatalities. METHOD We report pre-registered analyses from a longitudinal study which investigated personality predictors of compliance with behavioral recommendations in diverse U.S. adults across five waves from March through August, 2020 (N=596) and cross-sectionally in August, 2020 (N=405). RESULTS Agreeableness-characterized by compassion-was the most consistent predictor of compliance, above and beyond other traits and socio-demographic predictors (Sample A β = 0.25; Sample B β = 0.12). The effect of agreeableness was robust across two diverse samples and sensitivity analyses. In addition, openness, conscientiousness, and extraversion were also associated with greater compliance but effects were less consistent across sensitivity analyses and were smaller in Sample A. CONCLUSIONS Individuals who are less agreeable are at high-risk for non-compliance with behavioral mandates, suggesting that health messaging can be meaningfully improved with approaches that address these individuals in particular. These findings highlight the strong theoretical and practical utility of testing long-standing psychological theories during real-world crises.","Willroth, Emily C; Smith, Angela M; Shallcross, Amanda J; Graham, Eileen K; Mroczek, Daniel K; Ford, Brett Q",Psychosomatic medicine,349,31

The specific graft materials that were explored were extracellular matrix membrane, bilayer collagen membrane, living cellular construct, and acellular dermal matrix. METHODS Four different databases were queried to identify human controlled clinical trials and randomized controlled clinical trials that fulfilled the eligibility criteria. Relevant studies were identified by 3 independent reviewers, compiling the results of the electronic and handsearches. Studies identified through electronic and handsearches were reviewed by title, abstract, and full text using Covidence Software. Primary outcome in the present study was change in the width of KT. Results of the included studies were pooled to estimate the effect size, expressed as weighted mean differences and 95% confidence interval. A random-effects model was used to perform the meta-analyses. RESULTS Six hundred thirty-eight articles were screened by title, 55 articles were screened by abstracts, and 34 full-text articles were reviewed. Data on quantitative changes in width of KT were provided in 7 studies. Quantitative analyses revealed a significant difference in changes in width of KT between patients treated with soft tissue alternatives and patients treated with FGGs (P < .001). The weighted mean difference of changes in the width of KT was 21.39 (95% confidence interval: 21.82 to 20.96; heterogeneity I 5 70.89%), indicating patients who were treated with soft tissue alternatives gained 1.39 mm less KT width compared with the patients who received free gingival graft. CONCLUSIONS Based on the clinical outcomes, the results of this systematic review and meta-analysis showed that soft tissue alternatives result in an increased width of KT.

Unfortunately, drilling protection systems are not available in all hospitals. Thanks to the development of 3D printing in recent years, sharing devices and materials to solve surgical problems has become easy and inexpensive. The objective of our work is to evaluate a universal, freely accessible, 3D-printable drilling protection device. MATERIALS AND METHODS A prospective, randomized, and triple-blind evaluation of excess drilling was evaluated in expert surgeons and resident surgeons without the use of the protection device. Subsequently, excess drilling was assessed using the device in both groups. The differences in drilling lengths between both groups with and without the device were analyzed to establish the reduction of excess drilling in both groups. RESULTS The drilling in the expert surgeon without device group was 3.03 mm (SD 1.69 95% CI 2.40-3.66 p value = 9.89e-11), while the resident surgeon with device group performed excess drilling of 1.76 mm (SD 0.89 CI 95% 1.43-2.10). Results showed better results in the resident surgeon with device group than in the expert surgeons with device group (p value ˂ 0.01). The device improved drilling in both resident surgeons (5.77 mm) and expert surgeons (1.17 mm). CONCLUSIONS The device improves drilling in both expert surgeons and resident surgeons, showing greater benefits in the latter.

Various reconstruction techniques have been described and various devices employed but none has been established as superior. This study evaluates our experience with, and modifications of, the orally inserted anvil (OrVil™). METHODS We conducted a prospective observational study on 72 consecutive patients who underwent OrVil™-assisted oesophago-gastric or oesophago-jejunal anastomosis between September 2010 and September 2013. We collected data including patient demographics, disease site, type of procedure, location of the anastomosis, involvement of resection margins and peri-operative complications. RESULTS Seventy-two patients were included in the study. Patient ages ranged from 45 to 92 years (median ± SD = 69 ± 10 years). Total gastrectomy with Roux-en-Y anastomosis was the most-commonly performed procedure (n = 41; 57 %). R 0 resection was achieved in 67 patients (93 %). There were no Orvil™-related clinical leaks during the study period, and just two patients (2.8 %) demonstrated radiological evidence of leak, both of whom were managed conservatively. There were three in-hospital mortalities during the study period; these were unrelated to the anastomotic technique. CONCLUSION Despite a steep learning curve, the OrVil™ device is safe and reliable. It also permits the creation of higher trans-hiatal anastomoses without resorting to thoracotomy in high-risk patients with cardia tumours. Certain shortcomings of the device, that had implications for patient safety, were identified and addressed by intra-operative modification during the study period. We commend the use of a prepared OrVil™ device, as a game changer, for upper gastrointestinal reconstruction.","Salih, Abdelmonim E A; Bass, Gary A; D'Cruz, Yvonne; Brennan, Robert P; Smolarek, Sebastian; Arumugasamy, Mayilone; Walsh, Thomas N",Surgical endoscopy,349,30

The goal of this study was to compare agreement between two biochemical analyzers for plasma samples from alligator snapping turtles ( Macrochelys temminckii). Blood was obtained from the dorsal coccygeal vein of captive-reared, juvenile turtles ( n = 34), stored in lithium heparin tubes, and centrifuged to separate plasma from whole blood. Plasma samples were stored at 5°C prior to and in between analyses on VetScan (VetScan2, Abaxis, Union City, CA 94587, USA) and Olympus (Olympus AU640, Beckman Coulter, Brea, CA 92821, USA) analyzers within 2 hr of each other. Agreement between the VetScan and Olympus analyzers was investigated using Passing-Bablok regression analysis for aspartate aminotransferase, creatine kinase, glucose, calcium, phosphorus, total protein, albumin, globulin, potassium, and sodium. Agreement between the two analyzers was outside of acceptance limits and outside of clinical allowable error limits for all analytes as established by the American Society for Veterinary Clinical Pathology. The results of biochemical analyses of alligator snapping turtle plasma cannot be compared between VetScan and Olympus analyzers in a clinical setting. Comparison of biochemical analyses within analyzer units, however, may still be clinically useful. Future studies are warranted to investigate the precision of each analyzer for alligator snapping turtle plasma.","DiGeronimo, Peter M; Beaufrère, Hugues; Grasperge, Britton J; Nevarez, Javier G",Journal of zoo and wildlife medicine : official publication of the American Association of Zoo Veterinarians,349,1

Nurses have advocated for socially just care for more than a century, and our efforts have created a foundation on which to further build the state of HIV nursing science with sexual orientation and gender identity/expression (SOGI) Peoples. Nurses have also participated in the development of approaches to manage HIV disease for and in collaboration with populations directly affected by the disease. Our inclusive approach was guided by an international human rights legal framework to review the state of nursing science in HIV with SOGI Peoples. We identified articles that provide practice guidance (n = 44) and interventions (n = 26) to address the health concerns of SOGI Peoples and our communities. Practice guidance articles were categorized by SOGI group: SOGI People collectively, bisexual, transgender, cisgender lesbian, women who have sex with women, cisgender gay men, and men who have sex with men. Interventions were categorized by societal level (i.e., individual, family, and structural). Our review revealed opportunities for future HIV nursing science and practices that are inclusive of SOGI Peoples. Through integrated collaborative efforts, nurses can help SOGI communities achieve optimal health outcomes that are based on dignity and respect for human rights.","Phillips, J Craig; Hidayat, Jufri; Clark, Kristen D; Melisek, Julia; Balthazar, Monique S; Beck, Albert G D; Moore, Scott E; Dawson-Rose, Carol",The Journal of the Association of Nurses in AIDS Care : JANAC,349,28

METHODS Data were collected through the Survey on Maternal Health, a cross-sectional survey administered in Canada's ten provinces between November 2018 and February 2019 among women who gave birth between January 1 and June 30, 2018. A total of 6558 respondents were included. Weighted prevalence estimates were calculated, and logistic regression was used to model the relationship between symptoms consistent with PPA, PPD, and potential risk factors. RESULTS Overall, 13.8% of women had symptoms consistent with PPA, while the prevalence of having symptoms consistent with PPD was 17.9%. Results of the logistic regression models indicated that women who had a history of depression were 3.4 times (95% CI 2.7-4.2) more likely to experience symptoms consistent with PPA and 2.6 times more likely to experience symptoms consistent with PPD (95% CI 2.2-3.2) compared with those who did not. Women who reported good, fair, or poor physical health were 2.4 times more likely to experience symptoms consistent with PPD (95% CI 2.0-2.9) and 2.0 times more likely to experience symptoms consistent with PPA (95% CI 1.7-2.4) compared with those who reported very good or excellent health. Maternal marital status, other postpartum maternal support, and sense of community belonging were also significant. CONCLUSION This study highlights that a history of depression and good, fair, or poor physical health are associated with an increased odds of symptoms consistent with PPA and PPD, while other maternal support and sense of community belonging are associated with a decreased odds of these conditions.","Gheorghe, Mihaela; Varin, Mélanie; Wong, Suzy L; Baker, Melissa; Grywacheski, Vera; Orpana, Heather",Canadian journal of public health = Revue canadienne de sante publique,349,24

In cardiovascular trials of inhibitors of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2), exploratory results have suggested that such drugs may improve renal outcomes in patients with type 2 diabetes. METHODS In this double-blind, randomized trial, we assigned patients with type 2 diabetes and albuminuric chronic kidney disease to receive canagliflozin, an oral SGLT2 inhibitor, at a dose of 100 mg daily or placebo. All the patients had an estimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR) of 30 to <90 ml per minute per 1.73 m2 of body-surface area and albuminuria (ratio of albumin [mg] to creatinine [g], >300 to 5000) and were treated with renin-angiotensin system blockade. The primary outcome was a composite of end-stage kidney disease (dialysis, transplantation, or a sustained estimated GFR of <15 ml per minute per 1.73 m2), a doubling of the serum creatinine level, or death from renal or cardiovascular causes. Prespecified secondary outcomes were tested hierarchically. RESULTS The trial was stopped early after a planned interim analysis on the recommendation of the data and safety monitoring committee. At that time, 4401 patients had undergone randomization, with a median follow-up of 2.62 years. The relative risk of the primary outcome was 30% lower in the canagliflozin group than in the placebo group, with event rates of 43.2 and 61.2 per 1000 patient-years, respectively (hazard ratio, 0.70; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.59 to 0.82; P = 0.00001). The relative risk of the renal-specific composite of end-stage kidney disease, a doubling of the creatinine level, or death from renal causes was lower by 34% (hazard ratio, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.53 to 0.81; P<0.001), and the relative risk of end-stage kidney disease was lower by 32% (hazard ratio, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.54 to 0.86; P = 0.002). The canagliflozin group also had a lower risk of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, or stroke (hazard ratio, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.67 to 0.95; P = 0.01) and hospitalization for heart failure (hazard ratio, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.47 to 0.80; P<0.001). There were no significant differences in rates of amputation or fracture. CONCLUSIONS In patients with type 2 diabetes and kidney disease, the risk of kidney failure and cardiovascular events was lower in the canagliflozin group than in the placebo group at a median follow-up of 2.62 years.

Bevezetés: A COVID-19-járvány világszerte hónapokra átalakította a járóbeteg-ellátás működését is. Magyarországon a 2020. március 11-től 2020. június 17-ig fennálló egészségügyi veszélyhelyzeti rendelkezések szabták meg az új kereteket. Célkitűzés: Az első veszélyhelyzeti periódus második felében, 2020. április 22. és 2020. május 5. között mértük fel az epilepsziaellátásban részt vevő orvosok véleményét, hogy milyen mértékben változott a betegek ellátása, és hogyan élték meg a változásokat személyesen. Módszer: Internetes kérdőíves véleményfelmérés történt, a Magyar Epilepszia Liga 2020. április 16-17-re tervezett, de a COVID-19-járvány miatt elhalasztott XV. kongresszusára regisztrált neurológusok között. Kilenc egyszeres vagy többszörös feleletválasztós kérdés és 'szabad kommentár' mezők álltak rendelkezésre. Eredmények: A megkeresett 116 neurológus közül 33-an válaszoltak (28%), összesen 30 kommentár került rögzítésre. 73%-uk szerint a változások komoly nehézséget okoztak, 15%-uk gondolta, hogy ennek súlyos következményei lesznek. Új betegek fogadása 53%-ban leállt, 25%-ban nagy nehézségekbe ütközött. A gondozott betegek problémáit 49%-ban a távvizit lehetőségeivel élve meg tudták oldani, de 24%-ban ez nem sikerült. A beteg távollétében lebonyolított vizitek 68%-a dokumentált telefonbeszélgetések formájában zajlott. Az orvosok kétharmada veszélyeztetve érezte magát, hogy elkapja a vírust, ebből 40% úgy érezte, nem kap elegendő védelmet, 6% (2 fő) kapta el a fertőzést. Következtetés: A COVID-19-járvány a leginkább az új szakvélemények kiadását érintette, de a gondozási feladatokat sem mindig lehetett megfelelően megoldani. A károkat jelentősen enyhítette az ellátószemélyzet rugalmassága. A telefonvizitek, szükség esetén, az epileptológiában pótolhatják a személyes orvos-beteg találkozásokat. A járvány visszatérésének veszélye miatt a távvizit-alkalmazások technikai fejlesztése és ezek dokumentálási kérdéseinek megoldása fontos. A járványidőszakban a személyzet védelmére nagy figyelmet kell fordítani a fertőződés elkerülése és az orvosok biztonságérzetének fokozása érdekében. Orv Hetil. 2020; 161(46): 1939-1943. SUMMARY INTRODUCTION COVID-19 pandemic has transformed the operation of outpatient care worldwide for months. The new framework was set in Hungary by the health emergency regulations that existed from 11. 03. 2020 to 17. 06. 2020. OBJECTIVE In the second half of the emergency period, between 22. 04. 2020 and 05. 05. 2020, we surveyed the opinion of physicians involved in epilepsy care about the extent to which patient care had changed and how they experienced the changes in person. METHOD An internet questionnaire survey was conducted among neurologists registered for the annual congress of the Hungarian Chapter of the International League Against Epilepsy. Nine single- or multiple-choice questions and 'free comment' fields were available. RESULTS Of 116 neurologists contacted, 33 responded (28%), and a total of 30 comments were recorded. 73% said the changes caused a serious difficulty, 15% thought it would have serious consequences. Reception of new patients was stopped in 53%, and 25% encountered great difficulties. In 49%, the problems of the cared patients could be solved using remote visits, but 24% could not solve them properly. 68% of outpatient visits took the form of documented telephone conversations. Two-thirds of doctors feared catching the virus, 40% of whom felt they were not getting enough protection. 6% caught the infection. CONCLUSION The COVID-19 pandemic has mostly affected the issuance of new expert opinions, but care tasks have not always been adequately addressed. The damage was significantly mitigated by the flexibility of the care staff. Telephone visits, if necessary, can replace personal doctor-patient encounters in epileptology. The technical development of remote visit applications and their documentation issues are important. During the pandemic period, great care must be taken to protect staff in order to avoid infection and increase the sense of safety of doctors.

Very recently, an overwhelming inflammatory activation, which shares clinical similarities with Kawasaki disease (KD), has been described in children exposed to COVID-19. We report three KD-like cases that occurred during the pandemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in a highly affected area of Northern Italy. The clinical presentation was characterized by the presence of unremitting fever, diarrhea and elevated inflammatory markers. Case #1 and Case #2 occurred one week apart and shared other clinical features: laboratory tests confirmed COVID-19 exposure and high inflammatory activation with myocardial involvement. Case #3 followed a more typical pattern for KD. Interestingly, this patient showed lower levels of procalcitonin, C-reactive protein, D-dimers, and ferritin compared to the other two cases, whereas platelet count was higher. We hypothesize that SARS-CoV-2 might act in children as a trigger, either inducing a classical KD phenotype or causing a systemic inflammatory response leading to a severe KD-like phenotype, eventually characterized by myocardial impairment. We think that bringing these cases and their differences to the attention of the rheumatology community during the COVID-19 pandemic will be beneficial in order to highlight the importance of early diagnosis and to increase awareness of this new phenomenon.","Marino, A; Varisco, T; Quattrocchi, G; Amoroso, A; Beltrami, D; Venturiello, S; Ripamonti, A; Villa, A; Andreotti, M; Ciuffreda, M; Cimaz, R",Reumatismo,349,6

There are few data about clinical outcomes in RVI and compared to bacterial infections (BI) in this population. AIM To determine clinical outcome of RVI, compared to BI in children with HSCT. METHODS Prospective study, patients ≤ 18 years with cancer and HSCT admitted with fever at a National Bone Marrow Transplant Center (Hospital Calvo Mackenna), Chile, (April-2016 to May-2019). Clinical assessment, laboratory tests, blood cultures, nasopharyngeal sample for multiplex-PCR (Filmarray®), viral loads by PCR and cytokine panel (Luminex®, 38 cytokines) were performed. The following outcomes were evaluated: upper/lower respiratory tract disease (RTD), admission to ICU, mechanical ventilation, mortality and antimicrobial withdrawal. RESULTS Of 56 febrile episodes, 35 (63%) were RVI, 12 (21%) BI and 9 (16%) with unknown etiology (UE). Median of age was 8.5 years, 62% male gender. Rhinovirus (54%) and coronavirus (15%) were the more frequent detected viruses. No significant differences in cytokine levels were observed between RVI and BI. 94% of RVI patients had symptomatic RTD, versus 33% in BI and 33% in UE group (p < 0.001), with lower-RTD in 69% of RVI group (p < 0,001). Admission to ICU was 11% in RVI, 17% in BI and 11% in UE group (p = 0.88); only 2 patients required mechanical ventilation (p = 0.37) and no mortality was reported. After an RVI was detected by PCR, antimicrobials were withdrawal in 26% of patients with RVI (p: 0.04). CONCLUSION RVI are frequent etiologic agents in febrile episodes of patients with HSCT. Viral detection might help to rationalize the use of antimicrobials in this population.","Torres, Juan Pablo; Castro-Moraga, María Eugenia; Catalán, Paula; Maza, Verónica De La; Vergara, Alejandra; Valenzuela, Romina; Tapia, Lorena; Olivares-Morales, Mauricio; Farfán, Mauricio J; Santolaya, María Elena",Revista chilena de infectologia : organo oficial de la Sociedad Chilena de Infectologia,349,25

Cardiovascular (CV) sickness, diabetes, hypertension, and related conditions cause significant risks during the current situation and the affected people are under basic observation around the world. The hypertension and diabetes are related with alterations in the degrees of catecholamines associated with renal gland.

Strict measures generally focus on the patient-to-HCW contacts. However, interactions between the HCWs also pose a high risk for SARS-CoV-2 exposure. AIMS This study was aimed to investigate the effect of social contacts on the level of SARS-CoV-2 exposure risk among workers by broadening the current risk assessment algorithm. METHODS Contact tracing records of the workers in a large university hospital between 19th March and 31st December 2020 were analysed. Multivariate conditional logistic regression models were estimated to evaluate factors associated with high-risk exposure for contacts among workers. RESULTS Of the 329 exposed clusters, 260 (79%) were HCW-to-HCW contacted clusters. High-risk exposure was higher in the HCW-to-HCW contacts (44%), when compared to the patient-to-HCW contacts (5%) (P < 0.001). A total of 1827 HCWs contacted a laboratory-confirmed COVID-19-positive co-worker. Among the HCW-to-HCW contacts, high-risk exposure was higher in the support staff (49%, P < 0.001), in non-patient care settings (47%, P < 0.001) and in the social contacts (57%, P < 0.001). Social contacts between workers increased the high-risk exposure (adjusted odds ratio: 3.50, 95% confidence interval 2.62-4.69) in multivariate analysis. CONCLUSIONS A significant association between social contacts among workers and high-risk exposure of SARS-CoV-2 was observed. The results of the study emphasize the need for policies regarding the improved protection of HCWs in social settings in addition to patient care services.","Emecen, A N; Keskin, S; Boncukcu Eren, E; Yildirim Ustuner, B; Celik, S G; Suner, A F; Sezgin, E; Siyve, N; Basoglu Sensoy, E; Tutal Altas, E; Demiral, Y",Occupational medicine,349,1

To avoid osteotomy, one possible alternative is to enhance bone growth at the mental protuberance area with cell sheet transplantation. This study was undertaken to evaluate the efficacy of this approach in a pig model. MATERIALS AND METHODS Five 4-month-old pigs were included for mandibular bone marrow aspiration and MSC isolation. Triple-layer MSC sheets were then fabricated and utilized using culture-expanded MSCs. Four weeks after bone marrow aspiration, subperiosteal pockets were created on the labial symphyseal surface, followed by transplantation of autogenous MSC sheets to one randomly chosen side with the other side (control) receiving no transplantation. Six weeks after the surgery, the pigs were euthanized and the specimens from both sides were collected for computed tomography (CT) and histological and immunohistochemical analysis. Measurements between the experimental and control sides were compared using paired t tests. RESULTS MSC sheet fabrication and transplantation were reliably conducted. The labial cortical bone thickness increased significantly with MSC sheet transplantation by an average of 2 mm (p = 0.0001). The average measurements of mineral apposition rate and cell proliferation at the cell sheet side tended to be higher than the control side although the differences did not reach statistical significance (p = 0.1-0.2). Tissue mineral density measurements from CT images and bone volume fraction (BV/TV) measurements from histologic images were identical between the two sides (p > 0.5). CONCLUSION These data provide a proof of concept that autologous MSC sheets may be transplanted to the subperiosteal region of the mandibular symphysis to stimulate local surface bone growth.

Intraarterial (also known as endovascular or neurointerventional) therapies have been developed to address these needs. This review summarizes the current evidence for the efficacy of endovascular treatments in acute ischemic stroke. Randomized controlled clinical trials of acute ischemic stroke do not show any added clinical benefit of endovascular treatment over IV tPA alone in IV tPA-eligible patients, even in patients with persistent large-artery occlusion, nor have these trials provided evidence of clinical benefit in patients ineligible for IV tPA because they are >4.5 hours from onset, even if selected by sophisticated neuroimaging. The new stent retrievers, however, were rarely used in these trials. It remains to be determined from trials with direct head-to-head comparisons whether these new devices are superior to standard nonendovascular therapy. If there is a role for endovascular treatment of acute ischemic stroke, it is for patients who can be treated under 4.5 hours but who are ineligible for IV tPA because of increased hemorrhage risk from systemic thrombolytic drug effects, although this remains unproven.","Powers, William J",Southern medical journal,349,6

Emergence and reemergence are accelerated by rapid human development, including numerous changes in demographics, populations, and the environment. This has also led to zoonoses in the changing human-animal ecosystem, which are impacted by a growing globalized society where pathogens do not recognize geopolitical borders. Within this context, neglected tropical infectious diseases have historically lacked adequate attention in international public health efforts, leading to insufficient prevention and treatment options. This subset of 17 infectious tropical diseases disproportionately impacts the world's poorest, represents a significant and underappreciated global disease burden, and is a major barrier to development efforts to alleviate poverty and improve human health. Neglected tropical diseases that are also categorized as emerging or reemerging infectious diseases are an even more serious threat and have not been adequately examined or discussed in terms of their unique risk characteristics. This review sets out to identify emerging and reemerging neglected tropical diseases and explore the policy and innovation environment that could hamper or enable control efforts. Through this examination, we hope to raise awareness and guide potential approaches to addressing this global health concern.","Mackey, Tim K; Liang, Bryan A; Cuomo, Raphael; Hafen, Ryan; Brouwer, Kimberly C; Lee, Daniel E",Clinical microbiology reviews,349,17

Here we report that coronavirus nonstructural protein 15 (nsp15), an endoribonuclease, is required for evasion of dsRNA sensors. We evaluated two independent nsp15 mutant mouse coronaviruses, designated N15m1 and N15m3, and found that these viruses replicated poorly and induced rapid cell death in mouse bone marrow-derived macrophages. Infection of macrophages with N15m1, which expresses an unstable nsp15, or N15m3, which expresses a catalysis-deficient nsp15, activated MDA5, PKR, and the OAS/RNase L system, resulting in an early, robust induction of type I IFN, PKR-mediated apoptosis, and RNA degradation. Immunofluorescence imaging of nsp15 mutant virus-infected macrophages revealed significant dispersal of dsRNA early during infection, whereas in WT virus-infected cells, the majority of the dsRNA was associated with replication complexes. The loss of nsp15 activity also resulted in greatly attenuated disease in mice and stimulated a protective immune response. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that coronavirus nsp15 is critical for evasion of host dsRNA sensors in macrophages and reveal that modulating nsp15 stability and activity is a strategy for generating live-attenuated vaccines.","Deng, Xufang; Hackbart, Matthew; Mettelman, Robert C; O'Brien, Amornrat; Mielech, Anna M; Yi, Guanghui; Kao, C Cheng; Baker, Susan C",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,349,17

However, substantial variability in weight loss outcomes exists that remains largely unexplained. Our objective was to determine whether any commonly collected preoperative clinical variables were associated with weight loss following Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) surgery. METHODS The analysis was based on a prospectively recruited observational cohort of 2,365 patients who underwent Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery from 2004 to 2009. Weight loss was stratified into three major phases, early (0-6 months), nadir, and long-term (>36 months). Multivariate regression models were constructed using a database of over 350 variables. RESULTS A total of 12-14 preoperative variables were independently associated (P < 0.05) with each of the temporal weight loss phases. Preoperative variables associated with poorer nadir and long-term weight loss included higher baseline BMI, higher preoperative weight loss, iron deficiency, use of any diabetes medication, nonuse of bupropion medication, no history of smoking, age >50 years, and the presence of fibrosis on liver biopsy. CONCLUSIONS Several variables previously associated with poorer weight loss after RYGB surgery including age, baseline BMI, and type 2 diabetes were replicated. Several others suggest possible clinical interventions for postoperative management of RYGB patients to improve weight loss outcomes.","Still, Christopher D; Wood, G Craig; Chu, Xin; Manney, Christina; Strodel, William; Petrick, Anthony; Gabrielsen, Jon; Mirshahi, Tooraj; Argyropoulos, George; Seiler, Jamie; Yung, Marco; Benotti, Peter; Gerhard, Glenn S",Obesity,349,5

METHODS: We performed a single-center, retrospective observational study in critically ill patients with acute kidney injury or end-stage renal disease and evaluated the association of peak serum lactate levels with citrate intolerance (CI) during the initial 72 hours of RCA-CVVH, defined by serum total-to-ionized calcium >2.5 plus systemic hypocalcemia. RESULTS: Eighty-eight patients were studied (aged 59 ± 14 years, 66% males, Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II: 31 ± 8). Citrate was dosed at median 2.1 mmol/L of blood flow, with citrate load of 30 mmol/h, and CVVH effluent of 43 mL/kg/h. Twenty patients developed CI. Comparing patients with CI versus none, peak lactate levels were 8 (5-11) versus 3 (2-6) mmol/L, calcium replacement was 13 (10-17) versus 11 (8-12) mmol/h, and standard base excess was -4 (-12 to 1) versus 2(-4 to 7) mmol/L, respectively ( P < .05). Citrate intolerance developed in 38%, 44%, and 55%, in patients with peak lactate >4, >6, >7 mmol/L, respectively, versus 7% in those with peak lactate ≤4 mmol/L ( P ≤ .001), despite comparable citrate load and effluent rates across all categories. On multivariate analysis, hyperlactatemia and hyperbilirubinemia predicted CI ( P ≤ .01), which was associated with increasing calcium infusion requirement. Higher peak lactate from >4 to >7 mmol/L predicted CI with graded increase in odds ratio and specificity from 59% to 87%, but the corresponding negative predictive value from 93% to 87%. Area under nonparametric receiver operating characteristic curve for peak lactate and CI was 0.78. CONCLUSION: Hyperlactatemia predicts CI during RCA-CVVH with reasonable discriminatory performance in critically ill patients. Serum lactate surveillance may help preempt issues with citrate toxicity.","Tan, Jia-Neng; Haroon, Sabrina Wong Peixin; Mukhopadhyay, Amartya; Lau, Titus; Murali, Tanusya M; Phua, Jason; Tan, Zong-Yao; Lee, Nicholas; Chua, Horng-Ruey",Journal of intensive care medicine,349,32

Here, we review the studies regarding the microbiome of atopic patients with other respiratory infections and discuss the potential role of probiotics as therapeutic targets for COVID-19 to decrease its susceptibility and severity of COVID-19. RECENT FINDINGS Respiratory tract virus infection affects the gut and airway microbiome structures and host's immune function. Diverse factors in atopic diseases affect the airway and gut microbiome structures, which are expected to negatively influence host health. However, response to respiratory virus infection in atopic hosts depends on the preexisting microbiome and immune responses. This may explain the inconclusiveness of the effects of COVID-19 on the susceptibility, morbidity, and mortality of patients with atopic diseases. Beneficial probiotics may be a therapeutic adjuvant in COVID-19 infection as the beneficial microbiome can decrease the viral load in the early phase of respiratory virus infection and improve the morbidity and mortality. SUMMARY Application of probiotics can be a potential adjuvant treatment in respiratory virus infection to improve host immune responses and disturbed microbiome structures in atopic patients. Further related studies involving COVID-19 are warranted in near future.","Lee, Eun; Hong, Soo-Jong",Current opinion in allergy and clinical immunology,349,16

We examined the pathogen-specific nature of this autoreactivity by examining anti-BPI in bacteremia patients.Methods: Antibodies to bactericidal/permeability-increasing protein (BPI) and bacterial antigens were measured in sera by ELISA from five patient cohorts (n=214). Antibody avidity was investigated.Results: Bacteremic patient sera (n=32) exhibited IgG antibody autoreactivity against BPI in 64.7% and 46.7% of patients with positive blood cultures for P. aeruginosa and E. coli, respectively. Autoantibody titers correlated with IgG responses to bacterial extracts and lipopolysaccharide (LPS). A prospective cohort of bacteremic patient sera exhibited anti-BPI IgG responses in 23/154 (14.9%) patients with autoreactivity present at the time of positive blood cultures in patients with gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria, including 8/60 (13.3%) patients with S. aureus Chronic tissue infection with Staphylococcus aureus was associated with BPI antibody autoreactivity in 2/15 patients (13.3%). Previously, we have demonstrated that BPI autoreactivity in CF patient sera exhibits high avidity. Here, a similar pattern was seen in BE patient sera. In contrast, sera from patients with bacteremia exhibited low avidity.Conclusions: These data indicate that low-avidity IgG responses to BPI can arise acutely in response to bacteremia and this association is not limited to P. aeruginosa. This is to be contrasted with chronic respiratory infection with P. aeruginosa, suggesting that either the chronicity or the site of infection selects for the generation of high avidity responses with biologic consequences for airway immunity.","Theprungsirikul, J; Thaden, J T; Wierzbicki, R M; Burns, A S; Skopelja-Gardner, S; Fowler, V G; Winthrop, K L; Martin, I W; Rigby, W F C",Infection and immunity,349,12

Methods: A total of 122 patients with single early-stage HCC ranging from 2.1 to 5.0 cm received ultrasonography-guided percutaneous RFA as the first-line treatment. Seventy-one patients underwent switching RFA, and 51 underwent conventional RFA. Tumor response, major complication, local tumor progression (LTP), and overall survival (OS) were compared between the two groups. Log-rank tests and Cox regression models were used for univariate and multivariate analyses to identify predictors of LTP and OS. Results: The rate of initial local complete response rates were 100% (71/71) in the switching RFA group and 98.0% (50/51) in the conventional RFA group (P > 0.05). No major complication occurred in the switching RFA group, whereas two in the conventional RFA group. After a median follow-up period of 45.9 months (range, 9.8-60.0 months), the rates of LTP in the switching RFA and conventional RFA groups were 19.7% (14/71) and 41.2% (21/51), respectively. The cumulative LTP rates at 1, 3, and 5 years were 11.3, 20.5, and 20.5% for switching RFA and 17.6, 38.7, and 46.7% for conventional RFA, respectively (p < 0.001). Switching RFA was an independent factor associated with a lower LTP rate (p = 0.022). Five-year OS rates were 75.8% after switching RFA vs. 66.2% after conventional RFA (p = 0.363). Extrahepatic recurrence was a significant prognostic factor for OS in multivariable analysis. Conclusion: Compared with conventional RFA, switching RFA provides a high local tumor control for single early-stage HCC. An ongoing randomized trial might help to clarify the role of this approach for the treatment of HCC.","Huang, Guang-Liang; Liu, Ming; Zhang, Xiao-Er; Liu, Bao-Xian; Xu, Ming; Lin, Man-Xia; Kuang, Ming; Lu, Ming-de; Xie, Xiao-Yan",Frontiers in oncology,349,30

Currently, it is still unclear which sedation regimen best facilitates an ERCP. The N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonist esketamine has anaesthetic, analgesic and sympathomimetic properties and is known to cause less cardiorespiratory depression than other sedatives. It could therefore be an ideal adjunct to propofol for deep sedation. OBJECTIVE To assess the effectiveness of esketamine versus alfentanil as an adjunct to propofol target-controlled infusion (TCI) for deep sedation during ambulant ERCP. DESIGN A randomised controlled multicentre study. SETTING Endoscopic intervention suite at an academic and general hospital in the Netherlands. PARTICIPANTS Adult, American Society of Anesthesiologists Physical Status I to III patients scheduled to undergo ERCP. INTERVENTION Consecutive patients were randomly assigned to receive sedation for an ERCP with propofol TCI and alfentanil (group A) or with propofol TCI and esketamine (group E). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES The primary outcome was effectiveness of the sedation regimen expressed as the total dose of propofol - as a surrogate parameter - necessary to perform ERCP in a satisfactory manner for endoscopist and patients. Secondary outcomes were recovery time, patients' and endoscopists' satisfaction with sedation, side effects (e.g. psychotomimetic effects, nausea and vomiting) and the number of respiratory and cardiovascular adverse events. RESULTS Data from 162 patients were analysed. The total dose of propofol required was significantly lower in group E (n=83) (8.3 mg kg h) than in group A (n=79) (10.5 mg kg h) (P < 0.001). There were no significant differences in recovery time, patients' and endoscopists' satisfaction, side effects, psychotomimetic effects and the number of sedation-related adverse events. CONCLUSION Low-dose esketamine reduces the total amount of propofol necessary for sedation during ERCP in American Society of Anesthesiologists I and II patients without affecting recovery time, satisfaction of patients and endoscopists, side effects and respiratory or cardiovascular adverse events, when compared with alfentanil.

Examining global temporal trends and accounting for the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, we find that rates of severe food insecurity are declining, resulting in global decreases in the total number of severely food insecure people. However, the total number of moderately food insecure people has been increasing and, after recovering from the shock of the COVID-19 pandemic, we predict it will continue to increase through the end of the 2020s.

The HA (Pollard's rescaled method) and home performance-related statistics of matches contested before (n = 491) and after (n = 491) the 2019-2020 season break were calculated and compared, for each league and for all five, using the paired t-test or the Wilcoxon signed-rank test. Overall, the HA did not significantly decrease in European leagues (from 16.4% to 11.6%;trivial effect size [ES]);however, a one-sample t-test revealed that the HA after the COVID-19 break was significantly greater than 0% (small ES). While the HA completely disappeared in the Bundesliga (large ES), its effects remained stable in La Liga (small ES), Premier League and Primeira Liga (trivial ES), and even increased in Serie A (medium ES) after the return. Home teams' performances in these leagues were influenced to different extents by the COVID-19 situation, especially by playing behind closed doors. Altogether, significant decreases were observed for total shots, tackles (medium ES), shots on target and pass success (small ES). Therefore, the role of crowd support seems to vary depending on the context characteristics in which football is played. Also, the augmented ""information transfer"" from coaches to players during COVID-19 matches might have masked the crowd effects on the HA.","Almeida, Carlos H.; Leite, Werlayne S.",Biology of Sport,349,1

India has witnessed two waves affecting around 31 million people representing 16% of the cases globally. To date, the epidemic waves have not been comprehensively investigated to understand pandemic progress in India. In the present study, we aim for a cross-sectional analysis since its first incidence up to 26th July 2021. We have performed the pan Indian evolutionary study using 20,086 high-quality complete genomes of SARS-CoV-2. Based on the number of cases reported and mutation rates, we could divide the Indian epidemic into seven different phases. First, three phases constituting the pre-first wave had a very less average mutation rate (<11), which increased in the first wave to 17 and then doubled in the second wave (~34). In accordance with the mutation rate, variants of concern (alpha, beta, gamma and delta) and interest (eta and kappa) also started appearing in the first wave (1.5% of the genomes), which dominated the second (~96% of genomes) and post-second wave (100% of genomes) phases. Whole genome-based phylogeny could demarcate the post-first wave isolates from previous ones by the point of diversification leading to incidences of VOCs and VOIs in India. Nation-wide mutational analysis depicted more than 0.5 million events with four major mutations in ~97% of the total 20,086 genomes in the study. These included two mutations in coding (spike (D614G) and NSP 12b (P314L) of RNA dependent RNA polymerase), one silent mutation (NSP3 F106F) and one extragenic mutation (5’ UTR 241). Large scale genome-wide mutational analysis is crucial in expanding knowledge on evolution of deadly variants of SARS-CoV-2 and timely management of the pandemic.","Kumar, Sanjeet; Bansal, Kanika",bioRxiv,349,0

A subset of patients with this disease is especially prone to such exacerbations. These patients are labelled as 'frequent exacerbators'. Though yet poorly characterised in terms of host characteristics, including any genetic basis, these patients are believed to represent a distinct phenotype as they have a different natural history with a more progressive disease and a poorer prognosis than those who get exacerbations infrequently. Most exacerbations appear to be associated with infective triggers, either bacterial or viral, although 'non-infective' agents, such as air pollution and other irritants may also be important. Susceptibility to exacerbations is determined by multiple factors. Several risk factors have been identified, some of which are modifiable. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbations are major drivers of health status and patient-centered outcomes, and are a major reason for health care utilisation including hospitalisations and intensive care admissions. These are associated with considerable morbidity and mortality, both immediate and long-term. These episodes have a negative impact on the patient and the disease including high economic burden, increased mortality, worsening of health status, limitation of activity, and aggravation of comorbidities including cardiovascular disease, osteoporosis and neuro-psychiatric complications. Exacerbations also increase the rate of progression of disease, increasing the annual decline in lung function and leading to a poorer prognosis. Evaluation of risk of exacerbations is now included as a major component of the initial assessment of a patient with COPD in addition to the traditionally used lung function parameter, forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1). Decreasing the risk of exacerbations and their prevention is a major therapeutic goal of management in COPD.","Chhabra, Sunil K; Dash, Devi Jyoti",The Indian journal of chest diseases & allied sciences,349,27

Available published data, unpublished data, and recent collections (1997-2000) were compared and reviewed. Data were stratified by geography to compare the declining western Alaskan population in the Aleutian Islands through eastern Prince William Sound to the increasing population in southeastern Alaska. Prevalences of antibodies from the 1970s to the early 1990s were noted for Leptospira interrogans, Chlamydophila psittaci, Brucella spp., phocid herpesvirus-1, and calciviruses. Serum samples collected from 1997-2000 were tested for antibodies to these agents as well as to marine mammal morbilliviruses, canine parvovirus, and canine adenovirus-1 and -2. Conclusions could not be drawn about changes in antibody prevalence to these agents during the decline of Steller sea lions, however, because data were incomplete or not comparable as a result of inconsistencies in testing techniques. Despite these shortcomings, results provided no convincing evidence of significant exposure of Steller sea lions to morbilliviruses, Brucella spp., canine parvovirus, or L. interrogans. Steller sea lions have been exposed to phocid herpesviruses, caliciviruses, canine adenovirus, and C. psittaci or to cross-reactive organisms in regions of both increasing and decreasing sea lion abundance. Based on similar antibody prevalence estimates from the increasing and decreasing populations, these agents are unlikely to have been the primary cause of the population decline. They may have contributed to the decline or impeded population recovery, however, because of undetected mortality and morbidity or reductions of fecundity and body condition in animals under other stresses. Systematic monitoring for disease agents and their effects is needed to determine whether infectious disease currently plays a role in the decline and lack of recovery of Steller sea lions.","Burek, Kathy A; Gulland, Frances M D; Sheffield, Gay; Beckmen, Kimberlee B; Keyes, Enid; Spraker, Terry R; Smith, Alvin W; Skilling, Douglas E; Evermann, James F; Stott, Jeffery L; Saliki, Jerry T; Trites, Andrew W",Journal of wildlife diseases,349,24

METHODS This is a retrospective analysis of a COVID-19 cohort, in which 149 confirmed COVID-19 patients enrolled were divided into the group of myocardial injury (19 cases) and the group of non-myocardial injury (130 cases). Myocardial injury was defined according to Fourth universal definition of myocardial infarction released by European Society of Cardiology (ESC) in 2018, that cardiac troponin (cTn) was above 99th percentile of the reference level. Clinical information and results of laboratory tests of the eligible patients were collected. Factors associated with myocardial injury in COVID-19 patients were evaluated. RESULTS Compared with the group of non-injury, the patients in the group of injury were older and had a larger proportion of severe or critical cases (P < 0.05), higher respiratory rate and lower percutaneous oxygen saturation (SpO2) without oxygen therapy on admission (P < 0.05). All inflammatory indexes except for tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α) showed significant elevation in the patients of the group of injury (P < 0.05). Analyzed by Spearman correlation test, we showed that the levels of circulatory cTnI were in positive correlation with the levels of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), ferritin, receptor of interleukin-2 (IL-2R), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and interleukin-8 (IL-8) (ρ > 0, P < 0.05). Lower SpO2 without oxygen therapy on admission (OR: 0.860, 95%CI: 0.779-0.949, P=0.003) and higher plasma IL-6 levels (OR: 1.068, 95%CI: 1.019-1.120, P=0.006) were independent risk factors for acute myocardial injury in the patients with COVID-19 by multivariate Logistic regression analyses.

A central question in the Covid-19 pandemic is whether climatic factors have influenced its progression. To address this question, we used mortality rates during the first three weeks of recorded mortality in 144 countries, during the first wave of the pandemic. We examined the effect of climatic variables, along with the proportion of the population older than 64 years old, the number of beds in hospitals, and the timing and strength of the governmental travel measures to control the spread of the disease. Our first model focuses on air temperature as the central climatic factor and explains 67% of the variation in mortality rate, with 37% explained by the fixed variables considered and 31% explained by country-specific variations. We show that mortality rate is negatively influenced by warmer air temperature. Each additional Celsius degree decreases mortality rate by ~5%. Our second model is centred on the UV Index and follows the same trend as air temperature, explaining 69% of the variation in mortality rate. These results are robust to the exclusion of countries with low incomes, as well as to the exclusion of low- and medium-income countries. We also show that the proportion of vulnerable age classes and access to healthcare are critical factors impacting the mortality rate of this disease. The effects of air temperature at an early stage of the Covid-19 outbreak is a key factor to understand the primary spread of this pandemic, and should be considered in projecting subsequent waves.","Quilodrán, Claudio S; Currat, Mathias; Montoya-Burgos, Juan I",Sci Total Environ,349,1

This disrupts normal life routines, elements of which are important circadian cues. The pandemic is also associated with new stressors, altered roles, and uncertainties about health and economic security, which are also likely to affect sleep. The current study is an online survey of sleep experience, routines, physical activity, and symptoms of anxiety and depression, to study the alterations associated with the lockdown. Materials and Methods: The survey was conducted in early May 2020 using a questionnaire circulated through social media platforms. Questions related to demographic characteristics, current and previous sleep schedules, routine, and working patterns. Insomnia (Insomnia Severity Index - 4), Stress (Perceived Stress Scale - 4), anxiety and depressive symptoms (Patient Health Questionnaire - 4) and physical activity (International Physical Activities Questionnaire) were assessed using standardized instruments. Results: A total of 958 valid responses were received. Compared to the prelockdown period, there was a shift to a later bedtime and waking time, with a reduction in night-time sleep and an increase in day-time napping. These effects were visible across occupational groups, but mostly affected working individuals except health professionals. Sleep quality deteriorated across groups. Reductions in sleep duration were associated with depressive symptoms. Conclusions: The COVID-19 lockdown is associated with changes in sleep schedule and in the quantity and quality of night-time sleep. Although these changes are associated with elevated rates of emotional symptoms, it is unclear from these cross-sectional results, whether sleep deterioration produces psychological distress, or vice versa.","Gupta, Ravi; Grover, Sandeep; Basu, Aniruddha; Krishnan, Vijay; Tripathi, Adarsh; Subramanyam, Alka; Nischal, Anil; Hussain, Arshad; Mehra, Aseem; Ambekar, Atul; Saha, Gautam; Mishra, Kshirod Kumar; Bathla, Manish; Jagiwala, Mukesh; Manjunatha, Narayana; Nebhinani, Naresh; Gaur, Navendu; Kumar, Niraj; Dalal, Pronob Kumar; Kumar, Pankaj; Midha, Purav Kumar; Daga, Ritu; Tikka, Sai Krishna; Praharaj, Samir Kumar; Goyal, Sandeep Kumar; Kanchan, Shweta; Sarkar, Siddharth; Das, Sourav; Sarkhel, Sujit; Padhy, Susanta Kumar; Sahoo, Swapnajeet; Satyanarayana Rao, T S; Dubey, Vaibhav; Menon, Vikas; Chhabra, Vishal; Lahan, Vivekanand; Avasthi, Ajit",Indian J Psychiatry,349,30

METHOD: Description of the implementation of a combined teletherapy program for outpatient and day-hospital patients and the adaptations made to the inpatient protocol. Retrospective review of medical records and analysis of general and specific variables related to the pandemic and confinement. RESULTS: We held 1,329 (73.10%) telehealth consultations and 489 (26.9%) face-to-face outpatient visits with 365 patients undergoing treatment in the outpatient clinic or day hospital. Twenty-eight (7.67%) were initial evaluations. Twenty-two patients were newly admitted and 68 ED-related emergencies were attended. Almost half of the children and adolescents studied experienced reactivation of ED symptoms despite treatment, and severe patients (25%) presented self-harm and suicide risk. CONCLUSIONS: The implementation of a combined teletherapy program has enabled continuity of care during confinement for children and adolescents with ED. Delivery of treatment to adolescents in the day hospital program posed the biggest challenge due to their greater degrees of severity and higher hospitalization rates. An adapted inpatient program should be maintained throughout confinement, as the need for hospitalization of children and adolescents with ED does not decrease with lockdown.","Graell, Montserrat; Morón-Nozaleda, M Goretti; Camarneiro, Ricardo; Villaseñor, Ángel; Yáñez, Silvia; Muñoz, Rudiger; Martínez-Núñez, Beatriz; Miguélez-Fernández, Carolina; Muñoz, María; Faya, Mar",,349,20

The DELTEX family ubiquitin ligases (DTX1 to DTX4 and DTX3L) are characterized by a RING domain followed by a C-terminal domain (DTC) of hitherto unknown function. Here, we use two label-free mass spectrometry techniques to investigate the interactome and ubiquitinated substrates of human DTX2 and identify a large proportion of proteins associated with the DNA damage repair pathway. We show that DTX2-catalyzed ubiquitination of these interacting proteins requires PARP1/2-mediated ADP-ribosylation and depends on the DTC domain. Using a combination of structural, biochemical, and cell-based techniques, we show that the DTX2 DTC domain harbors an ADP-ribose-binding pocket and recruits poly-ADP-ribose (PAR)-modified proteins for ubiquitination. This PAR-binding property of DTC domain is conserved across the DELTEX family E3s. These findings uncover a new ADP-ribose-binding domain that facilitates PAR-dependent ubiquitination.","Ahmed, Syed Feroj; Buetow, Lori; Gabrielsen, Mads; Lilla, Sergio; Chatrin, Chatrin; Sibbet, Gary J; Zanivan, Sara; Huang, Danny T",Sci.

In the current COVID-19 pandemic, older people are particularly susceptible to a SARS-CoV-2 infection developing into severe disease. The objective of this review was to examine the literature regarding factors that may explain the tendency of this population to develop severe COVID-19. Research articles considered in this review were searched for in EMBASE, PubMed, and Web of Science from December 2019 to December 2020. Citations were screened by two independent reviewers. Studies of the immune system in older individuals found alterations in both the adaptive and innate immune systems. The adaptive system is depressed in its functions, and the innate system is in a pro-inflammatory state that can lead to chronic disease. This pro-inflammatory state may be related to a severe course of disease in COVID-19. This review shows that the level of evidence supporting an association between immune alterations in the elderly and susceptibly to severe progression of SARS-CoV-2 infection is generally consistent. Preventive measures such as early antiviral treatment are of key importance for prevention of severe progression of COVID19.","Pedreañez, Adriana; Mosquera-Sulbaran, Jesus; Muñoz, Nelson",Arch. virol,349,16

This approach has the potential to protect the most vulnerable from disease and provide society an incalculable economic benefit. Allo-priming healthy elderly adults is proposed to provide universal protection from progression of any type of viral infection, including protection against progression of the current outbreak of COVID-19 infection, and any future variants of the causative SARS-CoV-2 virus or the next 'Disease X'. Allo-priming is an alternative approach for the COVID-19 pandemic that provides a back-up in case vaccination strategies to elicit neutralizing antibody protection fails or fails to protect the vulnerable elderly population. The allo-priming is performed using activated, intentionally mismatched, ex vivo differentiated and expanded living Th1-like cells (AlloStim®) derived from healthy donors currently in clinical use as an experimental cancer vaccine. Multiple intradermal injections of AlloStim® creates a dominate titer of allo-specific Th1/CTL memory cells in circulation, replacing the dominance of exhausted memory cells of the aged immune system. Upon viral encounter, by-stander activation of the allo-specific memory cells causes an immediate release of IFN-Ï, leading to development of an ""anti-viral state"", by-stander activation of innate cellular effector cells and activation of cross-reactive allo-specific CTL. In this manner, the non-specific activation of allo-specific Th1/CTL initiates a cascade of spatial and temporal immune events which act to limit the early viral titer. The release of endogenous heat shock proteins (HSP) and DAMP from lysed viral-infected cells, in the context of IFN-Ï, creates of conditions for in situ vaccination leading to viral-specific Th1/CTL immunity. These viral-specific Th1/CTL provide sterilizing immunity and memory for protection from disease recurrence, while increasing the pool of Th1/CTL in circulation capable of responding to the next viral encounter. CONCLUSION: Allo-priming has potential to provide universal protection from viral disease and is a strategy to reverse immunosenescence and counter-regulate chronic inflammation (inflammaging). Allo-priming can be used as an adjuvant for anti-viral vaccines and as a counter-measure for unknown biological threats and bio-economic terrorism.","Har-Noy, Michael; Or, Reuven",J Transl Med,349,26

However, limited concern has been paid to the potential dangers of lowering serum uric acid (SUA). We observed lower levels of SUA in patients with COVID-19. Therefore, we aim to explore whether patients with COVID-19 had SUA lower than normal and the relationship of SUA and the severity of COVID-19. METHODS: This was a case-control study based on 91 cases with COVID-19 and 273 age- and sex-matched healthy control subjects. We first compared SUA levels and uric acid/creatinine (UA/Cr) ratio between patients with COVID-19 and the healthy controls. Then, we examined the association of SUA levels and UA/Cr ratios with COVID-19 severity in COVID-19 cases only, defined according to the fifth edition of China's Diagnosis and Treatment Guidelines of COVID-19. RESULTS: SUA levels in patients with COVID-19 were 2.59% lower, UA/Cr ratios 6.06% lower at admission compared with healthy controls. In sex stratified analysis, levels of SUA and UA/Cr were lower in male patients with COVID-19 while only level of SUA was lower in female patients with COVID-19. Moreover, SUA and UA/Cr values were 4.27 and 8.23% lower in the severe group than that in the moderate group among male COVID-19 patients. Bivariate and partial correlations analysis showed negative correlations between SUA or UA/Cr ratio and COVID-19 after adjusting for age, sex, BMI and eGFR. A multiple linear regression analysis showed that SARS-CoV-2 infection and male sex were independent risk factors associated with lower SUA levels. Male patients with COVID-19 accompanied by low SUA levels had higher risk of developing severe symptoms than those with high SUA levels (incidence rate ratio: 4.05; 95% CI:1.11, 14.72) at admission. Comparing SUA and UA/Cr ratio at three time points (admission, discharge, and follow-up), we found that male patients experienced severe symptoms had lower SUA and UA/Cr ratio levels comparing to moderate patients, but no significant difference between three time points. On the contrary, female patients had lower SUA and UA/Cr ratio at discharge than those at admission, but no significant difference of SUA and UA/Cr ratio between moderate and severe group. CONCLUSION: Patients with COVID-19 had SUA and UA/Cr values lower than normal at admission. Male COVID-19 patients with low SUA levels had a significantly higher crude risk of developing severe symptoms than those with high SUA levels. During disease aggravation, the level of SUA gradually decreased until discharge.

Versatile macrophage subsets engage to ensure maintenance of tissue integrity. To perform tissue stress surveillance, macrophages express many different stress-sensing receptors, including purinergic P2X and P2Y receptors that respond to extracellular nucleotides and their sugar derivatives. Activation of G protein-coupled P2Y receptors can be both pro- and anti-inflammatory. Current examples include the observation that P2Y14 receptor promotes STAT1-mediated inflammation in pro-inflammatory M1 macrophages as well as the demonstration that P2Y11 receptor suppresses the secretion of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-&#945; and concomitantly promotes the release of soluble TNF receptors from anti-inflammatory M2 macrophages. Here, we review macrophage regulation by P2Y purinergic receptors, both in physiological and disease-associated inflammation. Therapeutic targeting of anti-inflammatory P2Y receptor signaling is desirable to attenuate excessive inflammation in infectious diseases such as COVID-19. Conversely, anti-inflammatory P2Y receptor signaling must be suppressed during cancer therapy to preserve its efficacy.","Klaver, Dominik; Thurnher, Martin",,349,21

This necessitates the need to monitor and predict COVID-19 prevalence for adequate control. The linear regression models are prominent tools in predicting the impact of certain factors on COVID-19 outbreak and taking the necessary measures to respond to this crisis. The data was extracted from the NCDC website and spanned from March 31, 2020 to May 29, 2020. In this study, we adopted the ordinary least squares estimator to measure the impact of travelling history and contacts on the spread of COVID-19 in Nigeria and made a prediction. The model was conducted before and after travel restriction was enforced by the Federal government of Nigeria. The fitted model fitted well to the dataset and was free of any violation based on the diagnostic checks conducted. The results show that the government made a right decision in enforcing travelling restriction because we observed that travelling history and contacts made increases the chances of people being infected with COVID-19 by 85% and 88% respectively. This prediction of COVID-19 shows that the government should ensure that most travelling agency should have better precautions and preparations in place before re-opening.","Ogundokun, Roseline O.; Lukman, Adewale F.; Kibria, Golam B.M.; Awotunde, Joseph B.; Aladeitan, Benedita B.",Infect.

Hand trauma represents the most common acute emergency department presentation internationally. This study prospectively evaluates the COVID-19 related patient risk, when undergoing management within one of the largest specialist tertiary referral centres in Europe, which rapidly implemented national COVID-19 safety guidelines. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A prospective cohort study was undertaken in all patients referred to the integrated hand trauma service, during the UK COVID-19 pandemic peak (April-May 2020); all were evaluated for 30-day COVID-19 related death. Random selection was undertaken for patients with hand trauma who either underwent non-operative (control group) or operative (surgery group) management; these groups were prospectively followed-up within a controlled cohort study design and telephoned at 30 days following first intervention (control group) or postoperatively (surgery group). RESULTS: Of 731 referred patients (566 operations), there were no COVID-19 related deaths. Both groups were matched for sex, age, ethnicity, body mass index, comorbidities, smoking, preoperative/first assessment COVID-19 symptoms, pre- and postoperative/first assessment isolation and positive COVID-19 contact (p > 0.050). There were no differences in high service satisfaction (10/10 compared with 10/10; p = 0.067) and treatment outcome (10/10 compared with 10/10; p = 0.961) scores, postoperative/first assessment symptoms (1%, 1/100 compared with 0.8%, 2/250; p = 1.000) or proportion of positive tests (7.1%, 1/14 compared with 2.2%, 2/92; p = 0.349), between the control (n = 100) and surgery (n = 250) groups. CONCLUSION: These data support continued and safe service provision and no increased risk to patients who require surgical management. Such findings are vital for healthcare providers when considering service adaptations to reinstate patient treatment.","Miranda, B H; Zberea, D E; Pinto-Lopes, R; Zweifel, C J; Sierakowski, A; Sood, M K",Ann R Coll Surg Engl,349,25

Two highly similar network clusters were identified for UK and Israel, with three clusters emerging for India. UK and Israeli networks centred on “dealing with problems well” while Indian centred on “feeling useful”. As central items highlight aspects of well-being that influence or are influenced by other aspects, these findings may inform interventions to safeguard adolescent mental health during future phases of the pandemic.","Shukla, Meenakshi Wu Alison F.

This paper aims to examine how the design of a residential course was adapted to an online context and how this adaptation may prove beneficial to future iterations of the course. Design/methodology/approach: This analysis centers on a master’s-level course in which students design software to support learning. One of the major changes to the course revolves around the transition from a traditional rubric-based grading scheme to a specifications grading system. This latter approach provides a series of binary (pass/fail) requirements (specifications) that students must meet to pass. Various forms of interactions were also altered during the transition; the authors investigate these in the paper. Findings: This study found that the move to specifications grading helped students and the instructor to focus on the important work of meeting course learning goals. The approach also aligned well with authentic scenarios in which software projects are tested against certain specifications. Finally, this study concludes that thinking about specifications grading in the future can help us to develop more resilient pedagogical design approaches that respond to various forms of disruptions and changes. Originality/value: The course design insights described in this paper illustrate alternative ways of instruction that can be especially useful during times of emergency, but which may also provide an added level of authenticity and learner motivation during times of stability.","Quintana, Rebecca; Quintana, Chris",inform.Learn.Sci,349,2

The spread of the virus has two routes - exogenous and endogenous. The exogenous spread is from outside the population under study, and endogenous spread is within the population under study. Although some of the models consider the exogenous source of infection, they have not studied the interplay between exogenous and endogenous spreads. In this paper, we introduce a novel model - the Exo-SIR model that captures both the exogenous and endogenous spread of the virus. We analyze to find out the relationship between endogenous and exogenous infections during the Covid19 pandemic. First, we simulate the Exo-SIR model without assuming any contact network for the population. Second, simulate it by assuming that the contact network is a scale free network. Third, we implemented the Exo-SIR model on a real dataset regarding Covid19. We found that endogenous infection is influenced by even a minimal rate of exogenous infection. Also, we found that in the presence of exogenous infection, the endogenous infection peak becomes higher, and the peak occurs earlier. This means that if we consider our response to a pandemic like Covid19, we should be prepared for an earlier and higher number of cases than the SIR model suggests if there are the exogenous source(s) of infection.","Sivaraman, Nirmal Kumar; Gaur, Manas; Baijal, Shivansh; Rupesh, Ch V Radha Sai; Muthiah, Sakthi Balan; Sheth, Amit",,349,26

In addition to the direct removal of native vegetation, agricultural expansion often elicits other human-induced disturbances, many of which are poorly addressed by existing environmental legislation and conservation programmes. This is particularly true for tropical freshwater systems, where there is considerable uncertainty about whether a legislative focus on protecting riparian vegetation is sufficient to conserve stream fauna.To assess the extent to which stream fish are being effectively conserved in agricultural landscapes, we examined the spatial distribution of assemblages in river basins to identify the relative importance of human impacts at instream, riparian and catchment scales, in shaping observed patterns. We used an extensive dataset on the ecological condition of 83 low-order streams distributed in three river basins in the eastern Brazilian Amazon.We collected and identified 24,420 individual fish from 134 species. Multiplicative diversity partitioning revealed high levels of compositional dissimilarity (DS) among stream sites (DS = 0.74 to 0.83) and river basins (DS = 0.82), due mainly to turnover (77.8% to 81.8%) rather than nestedness. The highly heterogeneous fish faunas in small Amazonian streams underscore the vital importance of enacting measures to protect forests on private lands outside of public protected areas.Instream habitat features explained more variability in fish assemblages (15%-19%) than riparian (2%-12%), catchment (4%-13%) or natural covariates (4%-11%). Although grouping species into functional guilds allowed us to explain up to 31% of their abundance (i.e. for nektonic herbivores), individual riparian - and catchment - scale predictor variables that are commonly a focus of environmental legislation explained very little of the observed variation (partial R2 values mostly <5%).Policy implications. Current rates of agricultural intensification and mechanization in tropical landscapes are unprecedented, yet the existing legislative frameworks focusing on protecting riparian vegetation seem insufficient to conserve stream environments and their fish assemblages. To safeguard the species-rich freshwater biota of small Amazonian streams, conservation actions must shift towards managing whole basins and drainage networks, as well as agricultural practices in already-cleared land.","Leal, Cecília G; Barlow, Jos; Gardner, Toby A; Hughes, Robert M; Leitão, Rafael P; Nally, Ralph Mac; Kaufmann, Philip R; Ferraz, Silvio F B; Zuanon, Jansen; de Paula, Felipe R; Ferreira, Joice; Thomson, James R; Lennox, Gareth D; Dary, Eurizângela P; Röpke, Cristhiana P; Pompeu, Paulo S",J Appl Ecol,349,16

A better understanding of the immune response in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection could be important for identifying patients at greater risk of developing a more severe form of disease and with a worse prognosis. METHODS: We performed a cross-sectional analysis to determine the presence and the levels of both anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgA in a cohort of hospitalized patients with confirmed infection at different times in the natural history of the disease. Patients enrolled when admitted at the emergency department were prospectively followed up during hospital stay. RESULTS: Overall, 131 patients were considered with a total of 237 samples processed. Cross-sectional analysis showed that seroconversion for IgA seems to occur between days 6 and 15, while IgG response seems to occur slightly later, peaking at day 20 after symptoms onset. Both IgA and IgG were maintained beyond 2 months. Severe patients showed a higher IgA response compared with mild patients when analyzing optical density (8.3 versus 5.6, p < 0.001). Prospective analysis conducted on 55 patients confirmed that IgA appear slightly earlier than IgG. After stratifying for the severity of disease, both the IgA and IgG responses were more vigorous in severe cases. Moreover, while IgG tended to stabilize, there was a relevant decline after the first month of IgA levels in mild cases. CONCLUSION: IgA and IgG antibody response is closely related, although seroconversion for IgA occurs earlier. Both IgA and IgG are maintained beyond 2 months. Severe patients showed a more vigorous IgA and IgG response. IgA levels seem to decline after 1 month since the onset of symptoms in mild cases. Our results should be interpreted with cautions due to several limitations in our study, mainly the small number of cases, lack of data on viral load and clinical setting.","Carnicelli, Annamaria; Fiori, Barbara; Ricci, Rosalba; Piano, Alfonso; Bonadia, Nicola; Taddei, Eleonora; Fantoni, Massimo; Murri, Rita; Cingolani, Antonella; Barillaro, Christian; Cutuli, Salvatore Lucio; Marchesini, Debora; Della Polla, Davide Antonio; Forte, Evelina; Fuorlo, Mariella; Di Maurizio, Luca; Amorini, Paola; Cattani, Paola; Franceschi, Francesco; Sanguinetti, Maurizio",Intern. emerg. med,349,1

Here, we show that vaccination with VSV-eGFP-SARS-CoV-2 generates neutralizing immune responses and protects mice from SARS-CoV-2. Immunization of mice with VSV-eGFP-SARS-CoV-2 elicits high antibody titers that neutralize SARS-CoV-2 and target the receptor binding domain that engages human angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2). Upon challenge with a human isolate of SARS-CoV-2, mice that expressed human ACE2 and were immunized with VSV-eGFP-SARS-CoV-2 show profoundly reduced viral infection and inflammation in the lung, indicating protection against pneumonia. Passive transfer of sera from VSV-eGFP-SARS-CoV-2-immunized animals also protects naive mice from SARS-CoV-2 challenge.

Here we investigated whether women with PCOS are at an increased risk of COVID-19 infection. Design: Population-based closed cohort study between 31 January 2020 and 22 July 2020 in the setting of a UK primary care database (The Health Improvement Network, THIN). Methods: The main outcome was the incidence of COVID-19 coded as suspected or confirmed by the primary care provider. We used Cox proportional hazards regression model with stepwise inclusion of explanatory variables (age, BMI, impaired glucose regulation, androgen excess, anovulation, vitamin D deficiency, hypertension, and cardiovascular disease) to provide unadjusted and adjusted hazard risks (HR) of COVID-19 infection among women with PCOS compared to women without PCOS. Results: We identified 21 292 women with a coded diagnosis of PCO/PCOS and randomly selected 78 310 aged and general practice matched control women. The crude COVID-19 incidence was 18.1 and 11.9 per 1000 person-years among women with and without PCOS, respectively. Age-adjusted Cox regression analysis suggested a 51% higher risk of COVID-19 among women with PCOS compared to women without PCOS (HR: 1.51 (95% CI: 1.27-1.80), P < 0.001). After adjusting for age and BMI, HR reduced to 1.36 (1.14-1.63)], P = 0.001. In the fully adjusted model, women with PCOS had a 28% increased risk of COVID-19 (aHR: 1.28 (1.05-1.56), P = 0.015). Conclusion: Women with PCOS are at an increased risk of COVID-19 infection and should be specifically encouraged to adhere to infection control measures during the COVID-19 pandemic. Significance statement: Women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) have an increased risk of cardio-metabolic disease, which have been identified as a risk factor for COVID-19.

The aim was to investigate perceived stress, depression, perceived social support, habits and behaviour changes in pwMS through COVID-19 in comparison to a control group. METHODS: A web-based survey was posted on SMsocialnetwork.com to investigate perceived stress (using the Perceived Stress Scale), depression (with Patient Health Questionnaire 2) and perceived social support (using Social Provision Scale 10 item) in pwMS and a control group through the COVID-19 pandemic. A secondary group of people with migraine was investigated. RESULTS: In all, 1286 answers from 612 pwMS and 674 control people were included in the final analysis. The answers from 318 people with migraine were included for a secondary analysis. A higher proportion of pwMS were depressed (43.1% vs. 23.1%; p < 0.001), had a high level of perceived stress (58% vs. 39.8%; p < 0.001) and felt significantly less social support (median 33 vs. 35; Q1-Q3 28-36 vs. 32-37; p < 0.001) compared to the control group. A higher percentage of people with migraine were depressed (50% vs. 43%, p = 0.04) compared to pwMS.

The authors retrospectively investigated adverse events (AEs) by data-mining a self-reporting database to better understand toxicities, especially since it has been used during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. METHODS: A reporting odds ratio (ROR) was used to detect the risk signals from the data in the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) adverse event reporting system database (FAERS). The definition relied on system organ class (SOCs) and preferred terms (PTs) by the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA). RESULTS: The search retrieved 1,598 baricitinib-associated cases within the reporting period: 86 PTs with significant disproportionality were retained. Infections including 'herpes zoster,' 'oral herpes,' and 'herpes virus infection' were found at a similar rate to those reported in trials, and such events were rare. Reports emerged for several thrombotic adverse events, while these events were also rare. Unexpected safety signals as opportunistic infections were detected. Serious outcomes as death and life-threatening outcomes accounted for 9.76% of the reported cases. CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of these AEs does not appear above the background expected.

Studies investigating smaller scale epidemics, such as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), indicate that staff at the frontlines of an outbreak are exposed to an insuperable amount of stress and experience increased psychological morbidities as a result. Furthermore, research not only indicates that heighted levels of psychological distress are an occupational hazard associated with the law enforcement profession, but that members of the Garda Síochána feel their mental health needs are largely unmet by their organisation.

Specifically, the NH acidity of simple hydroxamic acid derivatives facilitated the syntheses of novel ß-lactams (oxamazins and monobactams), siderophore mimics that limit bacterial iron uptake and bacterially targeted sideromycins (siderophore-antibiotic conjugates). The development of resistance to our current limited set of antibiotic scaffolds has created a dire medical situation. As recently stated, ""if you weren't taking antibiotic resistance seriously before, now would be a good time to start."" A project commissioned by the British government (https://amr-review.org/) has released estimates of the near-future global toll of antibiotic resistance that are jaw-dropping in their seriousness and scale: 10 million deaths per year and at least $100 trillion in sacrificed gross national product. The 2020 COVID pandemic confirmed that infectious disease problems are no longer localized but worldwide. Many classical antibiotics, especially ß-lactams, previously provided economical cures, but the evolution of antibiotic destructive enzymes (i.e., ß-lactamases), efflux pumps, and bacterial cell wall permeability barriers has made many types of bacteria, especially Gram-negative strains, resistant. Still, and in contrast to other therapies, the public expectation is that any new antibiotic must be inexpensive. This creates market limitations that have caused most major pharmaceutical companies to abandon antibiotic research. Much needs to be done to address this significant problem.The critical need for bacteria to sequester essential iron provides an Achilles' heel for new antibiotic development. Although ferric iron is extremely insoluble, bacteria need micromolar intracellular concentrations for growth and virulence. To this end, they biosynthesize siderophores (Gr. iron bearer) and excrete them into their environment, where they bind iron with high affinity. The iron complexes are recognized by specific outer-membrane transporters, and once actively internalized, the iron is released for essential processes. To conserve biosynthetic energy, some bacteria recognize and utilize siderophores made by competing strains. As a counter-revolution in the never-ending fight for survival, bacteria have also evolved sideromycins, which are siderophores conjugated to warheads that are lethal to rogue bacteria. While none are now used therapeutically, natural sideromycins called albomycins have been used clinically, and others have been shown to be well tolerated and active in animal infection models. Herein we describe practical methods to synthesize new antibiotics and artificial sideromycins with the generalized structure shown above (siderophore-linker drug). Utilizing the molecular-recognition-based siderophore/sideromycin bacterial assimilation processes, it is possible to design both broad spectrum and exquisitely narrow spectrum (targeted) sideromycins and even repurpose older or more classical antibiotics. Relevant microbiological assays, in vivo animal infection studies, and the recent FDA approval of cefiderocol demonstrate their effectiveness.","Miller, Marvin J; Liu, Rui",Acc Chem Res,349,24

Scientific guidance on how to prevent transmission and the infectivity of SARS-CoV-2, particularly in dental settings, was lacking. Consequently, the dental community became highly anxious about the possible risk of transmission in dental settings. Because of the uncertainties regarding safety measures needed to practice safely, clinical operations at many dental schools were reduced to emergency services only. Some clinics reopened for expanded services later in the spring or summer of 2020 after COVID-19 safety protocols were adopted. This article reviews the evidence that was used to develop COVID-19 safety protocols at two dental schools: University of California San Francisco and Temple University. The policies were aimed at ensuring safety for all dental personnel and patients receiving dental care at the schools. At these two academic dental institutions there have been no reports of SARS-CoV-2 transmission due to exposure while dental care was being provided or received. This is a testament to the COVID-19 safety protocols put in place for the provision of dental care with minimized risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Rai, R.; Ismail, A.",Compend Contin Educ Dent,349,22

At a time of limited capacity, it is important to match available EEG resources to children who are most likely to benefit. In this study we evaluated a prospective triage tool for estimating the likelihood of epileptiform abnormality in children's first out-patient EEG. METHODS: We prospectively triaged 1865 out-patient referrals to the largest Paediatric EEG laboratory in Ireland. Based on a structured algorithm, we dichotomized first EEG referrals into priority and non-priority groups and assigned one of 5 sub-levels based on anticipated EEG yield. EEGs were reported by a single Consultant in Clinical Neurophysiology. RESULTS: Triage designated 757 (41 %) EEG referrals as non-priority. Priority exceeded non-priority referrals for all age groups except children between 18 months and 3.5 years. EEGs showed a two-fold higher incidence of interictal epileptiform abnormalities for priority referrals (36 % vs 18 %, p < 0.001). Rates of interictal epileptiform abnormality correlated with the 5 sub-levels of triage (p < 0.01). Epileptiform yield was highest (39 %) for children over 5 years vs 17 % for those under 5 years (p < 0.00001); these rates increased to 49 % and 20 % respectively for priority referrals. CONCLUSION: Structured pre-test triage of EEG referrals can identify children who have the greatest likelihood of epileptiform abnormality. In a mixed population of Paediatric referrals, the epileptiform yield of first time EEG is 49 % for children over 5 years who are referred with an appropriate EEG indication. This is subject to much variability with epileptiform yields as low as 13 % in younger children with non-priority referrals.

In addition to causing significant respiratory pathology, infection with SARS-CoV-2 (like infection with other respiratory viruses) directly or indirectly results in abnormal vasculature, which may contribute to hypoxemia. These vascular effects cause significant morbidity and may contribute to mortality from the disease. Given that abnormal vasculature and poor oxygenation are also hallmarks of solid tumors, lessons from the treatment of cancer may help identify drugs that can be repurposed to treat COVID-19. Although the mechanisms that result in vascular abnormalities in COVID-19 are not fully understood, it is possible that there is dysregulation of many of the same angiogenic and thrombotic pathways as seen in patients with cancer. Many anticancer therapeutics, including androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) and immune checkpoint blockers (ICB), result in vascular normalization in addition to their direct effects on tumor cells. Therefore, these therapies, which have been extensively explored in clinical trials of patients with cancer, may have beneficial effects on the vasculature of patients with COVID-19. Furthermore, these drugs may have additional effects on the disease course, as some ADTs may impact viral entry, and ICBs may accelerate T-cell-mediated viral clearance. These insights from the treatment of cancer may be leveraged to abrogate the vascular pathologies found in COVID-19 and other forms of hypoxemic respiratory failure.","Munn, Lance L; Stylianopoulos, Triantafyllos; Jain, Natalie K; Hardin, C Corey; Khandekar, Melin J; Jain, Rakesh K",Clin Cancer Res,349,14

Fortunately, despite the occupational hazard, the incidence of COVID-19 among anaesthesiologists and intensivists remains relatively low. Current evidence suggests that the majority of SARS-CoV-2 infections in this group were either contracted outside of the work environment or can be attributed to personal protective equipment (PPE) malfunction.

In this sense, it is also expected to develop specific machine learning algorithm for this purpose, through pulmonary segmentation, which can predict possible prognostic factors, through more accurate results. Our alternative hypothesis is that the machine learning model based on clinical, radiological and epidemiological data will be able to predict the severity prognosis of patients infected with COVID-19.

Specifically, 22% report they would want to wait and see how the vaccine is working before getting it, 7% would get the vaccine if required by school or work, and 15% would definitely not get the vaccine.5 Despite Centers for Disease Control recommendations, health care workers are also displaying vaccine hesitancy. To do so, health professionals must be able to demonstrate their own confidence in the benefits of the vaccine being greater than any possible difficulties.8 Moreover, health care providers' ability to combat vaccine myths is especially important in underserved and minority communities.","Awad, Magdi Furdich Kenneth Webb Dana Scott E.

Many ubiquitous transcripts are found to encode tissue-specific proteins. Discordance of RNA and protein enrichment revealed potential sites of synthesis and action of secreted proteins. The tissue-specific distribution of proteins also provides an in-depth view of complex biological events that require the interplay of multiple tissues. Most importantly, our study demonstrated that protein tissue-enrichment information can explain phenotypes of genetic diseases, which cannot be obtained by transcript information alone.

It causes the respiratory disease COVID-19 via the transmission of microbial pathogens within bio-aerosols during speaking, sneezing, and coughing. Therefore, understanding bioaerosol dynamics is important for developing mitigation strategies against droplet-induced infections. Computer modelling, using Computational Fluid Dynamics, has become a useful tool in studying and visualising the spread of atomised bio-droplets but the effect of using cloth facemasks has not been fully quantified. In this study, simulations were carried out to quantify the extent of respiratory droplet transfer with and without facemasks between a pair of ventilated rooms by a mathematical model for the first time. A 600-μm pore facemask was used, representing the porosity of a typical cloth facemask. Using the discrete phase model, the transport of ejected droplets was tracked. The results show that in the facemask cases, more than 96% of all the ejected droplets in all scenarios were trapped in the recommended 2 m social distancing radius around the human source. Correspondingly, only a maximum of 80% of droplets were deposited within the social distancing radius in the no facemask scenarios, with &gt;20% airborne and transported to the second room. One-dimensional empirical correlations were developed for droplet concentration as a function of distance from the bioaerosol source. The models show that droplet concentration decays exponentially from the source especially in the facemask cases. The study therefore reinforces the importance of face coverings in lessening the transmission of possibly infected respiratory droplets that transmit highly infectious diseases such as COVID-19.","Aliyu, Aliyu M.; Singh, Dharminder Uzoka Chino Mishra Rakesh",Journal of Building Engineering,349,16

This paper aims to understand how the Net.Create network visualization tool would support students as they tried to understand the many complex interactions in a historical text in a remote learning environment and how sustained knowledge building using Net.Create would shape student attitudes toward remote learning, collaboration and engagement. Design/methodology/approach: This paper explores changes in engagement and learning in a survey-level history course on the black death after a shift to remote learning during the COVID-19 pandemic. The authors used activity theory to focus the adaptation of Net.Create, a web-based collaborative social-network-analysis tool and to understand how it supported group-based remote learning. The authors describe how the redesigned activities sustained engagement with historical content and report coded student network entries, reading responses and surveys to illustrate changes in engagement and learning. Findings: The results suggest that students benefit from personal connections to historical content and their peers. Net.Create supported both through collaborative knowledge-building activities and reflection on how their quarantine experiences compared to the historical content they read. It is possible to avoid student frustrations with traditional “group work” even in a remote environment by supporting collaborative learning using Net.Create and a mix of individual and group contributions. Originality/value: This is the first use of a collaborative network visualization tool to support large classroom interaction and engagement with history content at the undergraduate level.","Craig, Kalani; Humburg, Megan; Danish, Joshua A.; Szostalo, Maksymilian; Hmelo-Silver, Cindy E.; McCranie, Ann",inform.Learn.Sci,349,1

The diversity of clinical manifestations after SARS-CoV-2 infection results in great challenges to diagnose CoV disease 2019 (COVID-19). There is a growing body of published research on this topic; however, effective medications are still undergoing a long process of being assessed. In the search for potential genetic targets for this infection, we applied a holistic bioinformatics approach to study alterations of gene signatures between SARS-CoV-2-infected cells and mock-infected controls. Two different kinds of lung epithelial cells, A549 with angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) overexpression and normal human bronchial epithelial (NHBE) cells, were infected with SARS-CoV-2. We performed bioinformatics analyses of RNA-sequencing in this study. Through a Venn diagram, Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery, Gene Ontology, Ingenuity Pathway Analysis, and Gene Set Enrichment Analysis, the pathways and networks were constructed from commonly upregulated genes in SARS-CoV-2-infected lung epithelial cells. Genes associated with immune-related pathways, responses of host cells after intracellular infection, steroid hormone biosynthesis, receptor signaling, and the complement system were enriched. Dysregulation of the immune system and malfunction of interferon contribute to a failure to kill SARS-CoV-2 and exacerbate respiratory distress in severely ill patients. Current findings from this study provide a comprehensive investigation of SARS-CoV-2 infection using high-throughput technology.","Wu, Yen-Hung; Yeh, I-Jeng; Phan, Nam Nhut; Yen, Meng-Chi; Liu, Hsin-Liang; Wang, Chih-Yang; Hsu, Hui-Ping",Int J Med Sci,349,1

Since then, it has arisen as a serious threat to the world public health. Since no approved vaccines or drugs has been found to efficiently stop the virulent spread of the virus, progressive inquiries targeting these viruses are urgently needed, especially those from plant sources. Metabolic profiling using LC-HR-ESI-MS of the butanol extract of Ocimum menthiifolium (Lamiaceae) aerial parts yielded 10 compounds including flavonoids, iridoids and phenolics. As it has been previously reported that some flavonoids can be used as anti-SARS drugs by targeting SARS-CoV-1 3CLpro, we chose to examine 14 flavonoids (detected by metabolomics and other compounds isolated via several chromatographic techniques). We investigated their potential binding interactions with the 4 main SARS-CoV-2 targets: Mpro, nsp16/nsp10 complex, ACE2-PD and RBD-S-protein via molecular docking. Docking results indicated that the nsp16/nsp10 complex has the best binding affinities where the strongest binding was detected with apigenin-7-O-rutinoside, prunin and acaciin with -9.4, -9.3 and -9.3 kcal/mol binding energy, respectively, compared to the control (SAM) with -8.2 kcal/mol. Furthermore, the stability of these complexes was studied using molecular dynamics of 150 ns, which were then compared to their complexes in the other three targets. MM-PBSA calculations suggested the high stability of acaciin-nsp16 complex with binding energy of -110 kJ/mol.

The serum IC90 (95% confidence interval) was estimated to be 4.2 (3.2, 4.3) µg/mL for bamlanivimab and 12.6 (9.7, 12.8) µg/mL for etesevimab. Observed clinical trial data confirmed PK and PK/PD model predictions that doses of 700 mg bamlanivimab and 1400 mg etesevimab would result in maximum reduction in viral load, with no additional effect seen at higher doses. No dose adjustment is recommended as age, sex, race, baseline viral load and hepatic impairment did not have a significant impact on the PK of the antibodies. Earlier drug administration resulted in greater reductions in viral load, demonstrating the importance of receiving treatment as soon as possible. Relative to placebo, typical reduction in viral load over a 7 day period was estimated to be 80 or 93% (drug administered 4 days or 1 days after the onset of symptoms, respectively), p<0.0001. PK/PD modeling and simulation was pivotal throughout the drug development and emergency use authorization process.","Chigutsa, Emmanuel O’Brien Lisa Ferguson-Sells Lisa Long Amanda Chien Jenny",Clinical Pharmacology & Therapeutics,349,10

There is, however, no effective antiviral drug that can be used to treat COVID-19 to date. Built on the fact that SARS-CoV-2 initiates its entry into human cells by the receptor binding domain (RBD) of its spike protein binding to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2), we extended a recently developed approach, EvoDesign, to design multiple peptide sequences that can competitively bind to the SARS-CoV-2 RBD to inhibit the virus from entering human cells. The protocol starts with the construction of a hybrid peptidic scaffold by linking two fragments grafted from the interface of the hACE2 protein (a.a. 22-44 and 351-357) with a linker glycine, which is followed by the redesign and refinement simulations of the peptide sequence to optimize its binding affinity to the interface of the SARS-CoV-2 RBD. The binding experiment analyses showed that the designed peptides exhibited a significantly stronger binding potency to hACE2 than the wild-type hACE2 receptor (with -53.35 vs. -46.46 EvoEF2 energy unit scores for the top designed and wild-type peptides, respectively). This study demonstrates a new avenue to utilize computationally designed peptide motifs to treat the COVID-19 disease by blocking the critical spike-RBD and hACE2 interactions.","Huang, Xiaoqiang; Pearce, Robin; Zhang, Yang",Aging (Albany NY),349,16

Background: Epilepsy is a neurologic disease that carries a high disease burden and, likely, a huge treatment gap, especially in low-to-middle income countries such as the Philippines. Design/Methods: Pertinent data on epidemiology, research, health systems and financing, pharmacologic and surgical treatment options, cost of care, and workforce were obtained through a literature search and review of relevant Philippine government websites. Results: The estimated prevalence of epilepsy in the Philippines is 0.9%. Epilepsy research in the Philippines is low in quantity compared to the rest of Southeast Asia. Inequities in healthcare services delivered to local government units have arisen due to devolution. Programs for epilepsy care by both government and non-government institutions have been implemented. Healthcare expenditure in the Philippines is largely out-of-pocket, with only partial coverage from the public sector. There is limited access to antiseizure medications, mainly due to cost. Epilepsy surgery is an underutilized treatment option. There are only twenty epileptologists in the Philippines, with one epileptologist for every 45,000 epilepsy patients. Epilepsy care delivery has been further impeded by the coronavirus disease of 2019 pandemic. Conclusions: There is a large treatment gap in epilepsy care in the Philippines due to high disease burden, sparse research, inadequate public support, inaccessibility of healthcare services and pharmacotherapy, underutilization of surgical options, and low specialist density. Addressing the treatment gap is expected to improve the overall survival and quality of life of epilepsy patients in the Philippines.","Moalong, K. M.; Espiritu, A.; Fernandez, M. L.; Jamora, R.

This background has laid the foundation for telemedicine to play a role in controlling the current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Telemedicine has the potential to allow the facilitation of providing the necessary medical care to patients without exposing them to contact with other patients or the general population. Objective: The aim of this study was to investigate the utilization of telemedicine by the Lebanese physicians during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: This cross-sectional online study was conducted using LimeSurvey® through an e-mail-based questionnaire sent to physicians currently enrolled in both Beirut and Tripoli Lebanese Order of Physicians. Results: Four hundred one physicians completed the survey resulting in a response rate of 5.85%. Most of the respondents (N = 401, 75.8%) reported using telemedicine to provide health care services to patients without in-person visits during the pandemic. Among those using telemedicine (N = 304), around 40% reported that they started using it during COVID-19 pandemic. Discussion: Literature states that the average time of an in-person clinic consultation is more than 15 min. This implies that telemedicine can play a role in saving physicians' time; this conclusion is supported by other studies that consider telemedicine a time-saving method of providing health care services. Conclusions: Our study indicated that telemedicine is used by the majority of Lebanese physicians and that this use has been accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic. Our results showed that telemedicine does have a potential that can allow it to be integrated in the health care system and implemented on a national organized level.","Shaarani, Issam; Ghanem, Ali; Jounblat, Mohammad; Jounblat, Hadi; Mansour, Reem; Taleb, Rim",Telemed. j. e. health,349,33

However, the vulnerability of physiological computing systems has not been paid enough attention to, and there does not exist a comprehensive review on adversarial attacks to it. This paper fills this gap, by providing a systematic review on the main research areas of physiological computing, different types of adversarial attacks and their applications to physiological computing, and the corresponding defense strategies.

OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this article is to explore the impact of COVID-19 on the daily operations of the stomatology department and provide some guidance for dental health care personnel around the world in continuing to provide exemplary care while limiting the spread of COVID-19. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Retrospective analyses were performed on dental patients' medical records from the stomatology department of the First People's Hospital of Yichang, China, which were collected in the pre-epidemic, epidemic, and post-epidemic periods. Hospital-wide triage and stomatology department-specific protocols were established in the hospital to prevent cross-infection during the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS: The number of patients decreased and proportion of emergency cases increased during the epidemic period. With prevention protocols in place, the number of dental patients returned to the normal range with a slight elevation during the post-epidemic period. Thus far, there has not been a single documented case of COVID-19 related to dental treatment in the hospital. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 has a major impact on daily life, including dental care services.

With a mortality rate reaching up to 5%, healthcare professionals treating patients with COVID-19 are at a significantly higher risk for exposure themselves. Given the rapidly progressing rate of COVID-19, there is an urgent need for developing guidelines within each specialty. This article discusses guidelines specifically for anesthesiologists dealing with ophthalmic surgeries with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patients. Anesthesiologists always work in the proximity of the patient's face while performing either ocular regional anesthesia or while managing the airway in the process of intubation/extubation. Within these guidelines, the emphasis is provided on thorough preoperative screening to identify COVID-19 patients and to prevent the exposure of healthcare staff by following standard personal protective equipment (PPE) precautions.","Ahmad, Nauman; Zahoor, Abdul; Ahmad, Abdulaziz; El Dawlatly, Abdelazeem",Saudi J.

The study presents the results of the analysis of the effectiveness of tocilizumab therapy (TCZ) in patients (n = 181) of different age groups with developed pneumonia caused by SARS-CoV-2. The aim of the study was to evaluate the effectiveness of TCZ therapy in patients of different age groups with developed pneumonia in the frame of COVID-19. Methods. Patients (n = 181) with community-acquired pneumonia caused by coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 are included in a one-center, non-randomized, prospective study to evaluate the effectiveness of TCZ therapy conducted at the State Public Health Institution ""City Clinical Hospital No.52"" of the Moscow City Health Department. Patients were divided into 3 age subgroups - up to 50 years, 50-70 years and over 70 years. Patients with community-acquired SARS-CoV-2-induced pneumonia receiving non-invasive oxygen support and patients who had artificial lung ventilation (ALV) were given a single dose of 400 mg of TCZ in addition to basic therapy. Results. There are no significant differences between age groups in the severity of pneumonia according to the data of the computed tomography (CT), however, a more severe condition and a higher mortality rate (p &lt; 0.001) were reliably observed in patients over 70 age compared to the other age groups. After TCZ treatment in patients of each age group, the severity of the condition assessed on the National Early Warning Score (NEWS2) has been significantly reduced compared to the baseline. Conclusion. According to the data of the pilot study the efficacy and safety of TCZ in patients of all presented age groups with COVID-associated pulmonary tissue lesion and signs of ""cytokine storm"" was demonstrated. At the same time, patients up to 50 years after the therapy of TCZ managed to achieve greater clinical efficiency compared to patients in other groups. According to the severity of the state and laboratory criteria, the lowest clinical efficacy of TCZ therapy was observed in patients over 70 years of age; as a consequence, the highest mortality rate was observed in the same group. At the same time, the TCZ therapy has not had a positive impact on the change of laboratory values and the severity of the disease in case of unfavorable outcome.","Fomina, Dar039; ya, S.; Poteshkina, Nataliуa G.; Beloglazova, Irina P.; Mutovina, Zinaida Yu.; Samsonova, Inna V.; Kovalevskaуa, Elena A.; Zagrebneva, Alena I.; Frolova, Nadija F.; Krlykova, Dar039; ya, B.; Kruglova, Tat039; yana, S.; Bobrikova, Elena N.; Serdotetckova, Sof039; ya, A.; Manchenko, Oksana V.; Markova, Tat039; yana, N.; Chernov, Anton A.; Lysenko, Mar039; yana, A.",Pulmonologiya,349,1

Under HFD, adipo-chemerin (-/-) mice showed improved glycolipid metabolism (decreases of TC, LDL, insulin and HOMA-IR) compared with flox (control) mice. Furthermore, OPLS-DA score plots found metabolites separations between adipo-chemerin (-/-) mice and flox mice fed with ND and HFD. Under HFD, 28 metabolites were significantly enhanced in adipo-chemerin (-/-) mice, and pathway enrichment analysis suggested strong relationship of the differential metabolites with arginine and proline metabolism, phenylalanine metabolism, and phenylalanine, tyrosine and tryptophan biosynthesis, which were directly or indirectly related to lipid metabolism, inflammation and oxidative stress. Under ND, taurine was increased in adipo-chemerin (-/-) mice, involving in taurine and hypotaurine metabolism and primary bile acid biosynthesis. In conclusion, the improved effect of chemerin knockdown on the glycolipid metabolism of HFD-feeding male mice might be associated with the increases of differential metabolites and metabolic pathways involving in lipid metabolism, inflammation and oxidative stress, which provided insights into the mechanism of chemerin from metabolomics aspect.","Yanan, Yang; Yi, Jia; Xiaojing, Lin; Jing, Qu; Xiaohui, Wang",Biomed Chromatogr,349,24

In May, the infection numbers registered a fall followed by a second new rise, not proportionally reflected by an increase in the number of deaths. We aimed to investigate the relationship between disease prevalence and infection fatality rate (IFR), and the number of intensive care unit (ICU) and hospital admissions over time, to develop a predictive model, as well as appraising the potential contributing factors underpinning this complex relationship. METHODS: A prospective epidemiological study using data from six countries collected between 10 March and 4 September 2020. Data on the number of daily hospital and ICU admissions with COVID-19 were gathered, and the IFR and the prevalence were calculated. Trends over time were analysed. A linear regression model was used to determine the association between the fatality rates and the number of admissions. FINDINGS: The prediction model confirmed the linear association between the fatality rates and the numbers of ICU and hospital admissions. The exception was during the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic when the model underestimated the fatalities indicating that a substantial number of deaths occurred outside of the hospitals. The fatality rates decreased in all countries from May until September regardless of the trends in prevalence, differences in healthcare systems or strategic variations in handling the pandemic. INTERPRETATION: The observed gradual reduction in COVID-19 fatality rates over time despite varying disease prevalence and public health measures across multiple countries warrants search for a biological explanation. While our understanding of this novel virus grows, hospital and ICU admission rates remain effective predictors of patient outcomes which can be used as early warning signs for escalation of public health measures.","Velicu, Maria Alexandra; Furlanetti, Luciano; Jung, Josephine; Ashkan, Keyoumars",BMJ Open,349,20

Nonetheless, it remains unclear how PTPN2 impacts the activation, survival, and memory formation of T cells. We find that PTPN2 deficiency renders cells in vivo and in vitro less dependent on survival-promoting cytokines, such as interleukin (IL)-2 and IL-15. Remarkably, briefly ex vivo-activated PTPN2-deficient T cells accumulate in 3- to 11-fold higher numbers following transfer into unmanipulated, antigen-free mice. Moreover, the absence of PTPN2 augments the survival of short-lived effector T cells and allows them to robustly re-expand upon secondary challenge. Importantly, we find no evidence for impaired effector function or memory formation. Mechanistically, PTPN2 deficiency causes broad changes in the expression and phosphorylation of T cell expansion and survival-associated proteins. Altogether, our data underline the therapeutic potential of targeting PTPN2 in T cell-based therapies to augment the number and survival capacity of antigen-specific T cells.","Flosbach, Markus; Oberle, Susanne G; Scherer, Stefanie; Zecha, Jana; von Hoesslin, Madlaina; Wiede, Florian; Chennupati, Vijaykumar; Cullen, Jolie G; List, Markus; Pauling, Josch K; Baumbach, Jan; Kuster, Bernhard; Tiganis, Tony; Zehn, Dietmar",Cell Rep,349,5

However, data regarding the prevalence of these disorders in Norway are scarce. The aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence of smell, taste, trigeminal disorders and associated factors in a 65-year-old population in Oslo, Norway. METHODS: A random sample of 223 individuals (123 men, 100 women) participated in the study. Medical history was obtained, and unstimulated whole saliva (UWS) and stimulated whole saliva (SWS) were collected to determine salivary secretion rates. Sniffin`n Sticks and Taste Strips (Burghart Messtechnik GmbH, Wedel, Germany) were used for quantitative testing of olfactory and gustatory function. In addition, the participants' self-reported perceptions of smell and taste, and burning mouth sensation were investigated. RESULTS: The results showed that 34 % of the participants had reduced smell (28 % hyposmia and 6 % anosmia) and 28 % had reduced taste perception (21 % hypogeusia and 7 % ageusia). 13 % of the partcipants had a combination of smell and taste disorders. Dysgeusia was reported by 5 % and burning mouth sensation (syndrome) by 3 % of the participants. Hyposmia, hypogeusia and ageusia were significantly more prevalent among men. Significant associations were found between taste disorders and previous history of cerebral hemorrhage and heart attack, and between burning mouth sensation and gastrointestinal disorders. Disturbances in olfactory, gustatory and trigeminal function were significantly related to medication use. Ageusia and burning mouth sensation were significantly more prevalent among smokers. Except from higher prevalence of ageusia among participants with hyposalivation with respect to SWS, no significant associations were found between salivary secretion rate and chemosensory or trigeminal disorders in the present study. CONCLUSIONS: The present study revealed that one-third of 65-year-old individuals had impaired smell and more than one-fourth had impaired taste function. The prevalence of dysgeusia and burning mouth sensation was very low. Reduced smell and taste perception were more common among men than women. Furthermore, some diseases and medications were associated with chemosensory and trigeminal disorders. Ageusia was associated with SWS hyposalivation.","Sødal, Anne Thea Tveit; Singh, Preet Bano; Skudutyte-Rysstad, Rasa; Diep, My Tien; Hove, Lene Hystad",BMC Geriatr,349,20

Materials and Methods: In April and May 2020, an online survey comprised of questions regarding past and current VH practices, as well as plans for future use was distributed among eye care providers nationwide. Results: Of the 117 eye care providers who completed the survey, 96.6% were not using VH before the COVID-19 pandemic. In contrast, 77.4% reported using VH during the pandemic. The majority of visits were for red eye (64.4%, n = 56) and ocular surface complaints (58.6%, n = 51). Examination components tested virtually varied, but most respondents felt these were at least ""somewhat reliable."" Almost half of respondents (45%) felt it was ""very easy"" or ""somewhat easy"" to implement VH and the majority (53.8%, n = 43) were able to get it up and running in under a week. The majority felt the transition to VH was positive (57.5%), however, only 50.4% (n = 53) of those providers planned to use VH regularly once able to see patients safely in clinic again. Conclusions: While the majority of U.S. eye care providers who responded were not using VH before the COVID-19 pandemic, just months into the U.S. outbreak, 77.4% were using VH in their daily practice. In general, providers used these platforms for urgent examinations, adnexal disease, and postoperative care most often.

Although most COVID-19 cases are mild, some are severe or critical, predominantly due to acute lung injury. It has been widely accepted that a counter regulatory renin-angiotensin system (RAS) axis including the ACE2/ANG [1-7]/Mas protects the lungs from acute lung injury. However, recent evidence suggests that the generation of protective ANG [1-7] in the lungs is predominantly mediated by proinflammatory prolyl oligopeptidase (POP), which has been repeatedly demonstrated to be involved in lung pathology. This review contends that acute lung injury in severe COVID-19 is characterised by a) ACE2 downregulation and malfunction (inflammatory signalling) due to viral occupation, and b) dysregulation of the protective RAS axis, predominantly due to increased activity of proinflammatory POP. It follows that a reasonable treatment strategy in COVID-19-related acute lung injury would be delivering functional recombinant (r) ACE2 forms to trap the virus. Additionally, or alternatively to rACE2 delivery, the potential benefits resulting from lowering POP activity should also be explored. These treatment strategies deserve further investigation.","Triposkiadis, Filippos; Starling, Randall C; Xanthopoulos, Andrew; Butler, Javed; Boudoulas, Harisios",Heart Lung Circ,349,16

As vaccination programs roll out globally and social distancing is relaxed, future SARS-CoV-2 trends are uncertain. MethodsWe analysed prevalence trends and their drivers using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) swab-positivity data from round 12 (between 20 May and 7 June 2021) and round 13 (between 24 June and 12 July 2021) of the REal-time Assessment of Community Transmission-1 (REACT-1) study, with swabs sent to non-overlapping random samples of the population ages 5 years and over in England. ResultsWe observed sustained exponential growth with an average doubling time in round 13 of 25 days (lower Credible Interval of 15 days) and an increase in average prevalence from 0.15% (0.12%, 0.18%) in round 12 to 0.63% (0.57%, 0.18%) in round 13. The rapid growth across and within rounds appears to have been driven by complete replacement of Alpha variant by Delta, and by the high prevalence in younger less-vaccinated age groups, with a nine-fold increase between rounds 12 and 13 among those aged 13 to 17 years. Prevalence among those who reported being unvaccinated was three-fold higher than those who reported being fully vaccinated. However, in round 13, 44% of infections occurred in fully vaccinated individuals, reflecting imperfect vaccine effectiveness against infection despite high overall levels of vaccination. Using self-reported vaccination status, we estimated adjusted vaccine effectiveness against infection in round 13 of 49% (22%, 67%) among participants aged 18 to 64 years, which rose to 58% (33%, 73%) when considering only strong positives (Cycle threshold [Ct] values < 27); also, we estimated adjusted vaccine effectiveness against symptomatic infection of 59% (23%, 78%), with any one of three common COVID-19 symptoms reported in the month prior to swabbing. Sex (round 13 only), ethnicity, household size and local levels of deprivation jointly contributed to the risk of higher prevalence of swab-positivity. DiscussionFrom end May to beginning July 2021 in England, where there has been a highly successful vaccination campaign with high vaccine uptake, infections were increasing exponentially driven by the Delta variant and high infection prevalence among younger, unvaccinated individuals despite double vaccination continuing to effectively reduce transmission. Although slower growth or declining prevalence may be observed during the summer in the northern hemisphere, increased mixing during the autumn in the presence of the Delta variant may lead to renewed growth, even at high levels of vaccination.","Elliott, Paul; Haw, David J; Wang, Haowei; Eales, Oliver; Walters, Caroline E; Ainslie, Kylie E.

Pulmonary hypertension patients need persistent medical care; however, limited reports focused on them when there was an outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 in China. This national survey was aimed to evaluate the overall condition of pulmonary hypertension patients during this period. A questionnaire regarding the living condition of pulmonary hypertension patients during coronavirus disease 2019 was designed by pulmonary hypertension diagnostic experts in Wuhan Asia Heart Hospital. Pulmonary hypertension patients and their family members were invited to participate in this survey online. One-hundred twenty pulmonary hypertension patients and 23 family members participated in the survey; 64.8% (n = 87) participants came from Hubei, and others were from 15 other provinces; 98.6% (n = 141) participants were in home quarantine; 65.8% (n = 79) were pulmonary arterial hypertension associated with congenital heart disease; and 76.7% (n = 92) patients proclaimed their heart function was well maintained at class I or II. One (0.8%) patient was confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection. Two (1.7%) patients were hospitalized due to heart function worsening. Nearly 70% (n = 100) participants implied shortage in medications during coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak. A total of 24.2% (n = 29) patients indicated that medications were discontinued due to the insufficient supply. Most of the participants stayed optimistic on either coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak or their pulmonary hypertension disease, and 61.7% (n = 74) patients would go to the hospital for follow-up immediately after outbreak. These preliminary data show pulmonary hypertension patients are able to avoid severe disease when they are in home quarantine. Medication supplement is important for pulmonary hypertension patients when their heart function is well maintained. In addition, there might be increasing requirements of medical care for pulmonary hypertension patients after the outbreak.","Zhou, Hongmei; Zhang, Gangcheng; Deng, Xiaoxian; Jin, Bowen; Qiu, Qiu; Yan, Menghuan; Wang, Xi; Zheng, Xuan",Pulm.

Whereas some regions still record tens of thousands of new infections daily, other regions have contained the virus. What explains these striking regional differences? We advance a cultural psychological perspective on mask usage, a precautionary measure vital for curbing the pandemic. Four large-scale studies provide evidence that collectivism (versus individualism) positively predicts mask usage-both within the United States and across the world. Analyzing a dataset of all 3,141 counties of the 50 US states (based on 248,941 individuals), Study 1a revealed that mask usage was higher in more collectivistic US states. Study 1b replicated this finding in another dataset of 16,737 individuals in the 50 US states. Analyzing a dataset of 367,109 individuals in 29 countries, Study 2 revealed that mask usage was higher in more collectivistic countries. Study 3 replicated this finding in a dataset of 277,219 Facebook users in 67 countries. The link between collectivism and mask usage was robust to a host of control variables, including cultural tightness-looseness, political affiliation, demographics, population density, socioeconomic indicators, universal health coverage, government response stringency, and time. Our research suggests that culture fundamentally shapes how people respond to crises like the COVID-19 pandemic. Understanding cultural differences not only provides insight into the current pandemic, but also helps the world prepare for future crises.","Lu, Jackson G; Jin, Peter; English, Alexander S",Proc.

Public health surveillance is one of the cornerstones of public health practice, and it empowers decision makers to lead and manage public health crises and programs more effectively by providing timely and useful evidence. OBJECTIVE: This paper presents the protocol for a study that aims to identify, track, and monitor trends in the population in Saudi Arabia at risk of major depressive disorders and anxiety during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: This study utilizes continuous, cross-sectional, national-level mental health screening via computer-assisted phone interviews, conducted in four waves on a monthly basis (between May and August 2020). Arabic-speaking adults, aged &#8805;18 years, and living in Saudi Arabia were recruited via a random phone list. This surveillance system used the proportional quota sampling technique to achieve an equal distribution of participants, stratified by age and gender, and region, within and across the 13 administrative regions of Saudi Arabia. A sample size of 4056 participants per wave was calculated to achieve enough power to detect changes in mental health status. The questionnaire includes the Arabic version of the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) to measure depressive symptoms and the General Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) to measure anxiety. In addition, it will collect data on sociodemographic variables and potential risk factors. RESULTS: Study recruitment began in May 2020. The data analysis was completed in October 2020, and the final report is expected to be published by the end of December 2020. CONCLUSIONS: Monitoring the population's mental health status during the COVID-19 pandemic will inform decision makers of any potential deterioration in mental health on a national level and among subgroups, including across regions, age groups, and gender groups. It will allow decision makers to recognize issues and intervene sooner. It will also provide valuable scientific data to help understand the effects of epidemics and pandemics on mental health.

Here, we developed an improved and highly sensitive approach to SARS-CoV-2 detection via coupling bioluminescence in real-time (BART) and reverse-transcriptase loop-mediated amplification (RT-LAMP) protocols (RT-LAMP-BART) and was also compatible with a digital LAMP system (Rainsuit), which did not allow for real-time quantification but did, nonetheless, facilitate absolute quantification with a comparable detection limit of 104 copies/mL. Through improving RNA availability in samples to ensure the target RNA present in reaction, we additionally developed a simulated digital RT-LAMP approach using this same principle to enlarge the overall reaction volume and to achieve real-time detection with a limit of detection of 10 copies/mL, and with further improvements in the overall dynamic range of this assay system being achieved through additional optimization.","Fei, Zhongjie; Wei, Rongbin; Cheng, Chu; Xiao, Pengfeng",Int. j. mol. sci.

Since that day, COVID-19 has spread worldwide, affecting 153 million people. Education, as many other sectors, has managed to adapt to the requirements and barriers implied by the impossibility to teach students face-to-face as it was done before. Yet, little is known about the implications of emergency remote teaching (ERT) during the pandemic. This study describes and analyzes the impact of the pandemic on the study patterns of higher education students. The analysis was performed by the integration of three main components: (1) interaction with the learning management system (LMS), (2) Assignment submission rate, and (3) Teachers' perspective. Several variables were created to analyze the study patterns, clicks on different LMS components, usage during the day, week and part of the term, the time span of interaction with the LMS, and grade categories. The results showed significant differences in study patterns depending on the year of study, and the variables reflecting the effect of teachers' changes in the course structure are identified. This study outlines the first insights of higher education's new normality, providing important implications for supporting teachers in creating academic material that adequately addresses students' particular needs depending on their year of study, changes in study pattern, and distribution of time and activity through the term.","Flores, Nidia Guadalupe L'opez; Islind, Anna Sigridur; 'Oskarsd'ottir, Mar'ia",,349,21

It compelled all Educational Institutions to close down. To keep teaching-learning process continuing, massive shift is being observed from physical classrooms to virtual classrooms. Language plays a key role in learning. Hence meaningful language learning is a must. Creating a conducive learning environment to teach languages effectively online, necessitates the use of virtual classroom by Language Teachers. However, it may create various challenges, unless the mindset of the teachers is positive and ready to adapt to new situations. Present study aims to find out challenges faced by the language teachers and their adaptability towards online teaching during COVID pandemic. The researcher used descriptive survey method. The sample of the study included 51 language teachers teaching at college level in the state of Maharashtra. The sampling technique used was snowballing through known contacts. The tool used was questionnaire. Data was analysed through descriptive and inferential statistical techniques such percentage, mean, standard deviation, graphical representation and ‘t’ test. The findings of the study revealed that there is significant difference between the challenges faced by urban and rural language teachers. But no significant difference was found among urban and rural language teachers in adaptability towards virtual classroom teaching.

Both epithelial and endothelial cells of the cornea harbor primary cilia, which sense changes in the external environment and regulate intracellular signaling pathways. Accumulating evidence suggests that the primary cilium regulates corneal development in several ways, including participation in corneal epithelial stratification and maintenance of corneal endothelial cell morphology. In addition, the primary cilium has been implicated in the pathogenesis of several corneal diseases. In this review, we discuss recent findings that demonstrate the critical role of the primary cilium in corneal development. We also discuss the link between ciliary dysfunction and corneal diseases, which suggests that the primary cilium could be targeted to treat these diseases.","Song, Ting; Zhou, Jun",Zool Res,349,24

CoVs are enveloped viruses whose proteins include spike (S), membrane (M), and envelope (E) which are embedded in the viral envelope. The glycosylated S protein, which forms homo-trimeric spikes on the surface of the viral particle, mediates viral entry into host cells. SARS-CoV-2, like SARS-CoV, uses the Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2) cell surface protein for cellular entry. An attractive anti-viral approach is targeting virus entry into cells, for which three strategies are suggested: 1) direct targeting of the viral glycoprotein; 2) targeting the viral receptor on the cell surface; and 3) using soluble (s) ACE2 that binds to S protein thereby neutralizing the virus. In this article, the advantages and disadvantages of these strategies are explained. Moreover, we propose that fusion of the sACE2 to anti-CD16 to produce a bi-speciï¬c molecule could be a promising anti-viral strategy.","Sheikhi, Abdolkarim; Hojjat-Farsangi, Mohammad",Hum Vaccin Immunother,349,16

This study aims to investigate the impact of different types of rotations in various testing contexts. MethodsWe built an agent-based model of interactions among pupils and teachers based on an online survey in an elementary school in Prague, Czechia. This model contains 624 schoolchildren and 55 teachers (679 nodes) and about 27 thousands social contacts (edges) in 10 layers. The layers reflect different types of contacts (in classroom, cafeteria etc.) as described in the survey. On this multi-graph structure we run a modified SEIR model of the covid-19 dynamics. The parameters of the model are calibrated on data from the outbreak in the Czech Republic in the period March to June 2020. FindingsThere are three main findings in our paper. O_LIWeekly rotations of in-class and distance learning reduce the spread of covid-19 by 75-81% and thus represent an effective preventative measure in school setting. C_LIO_LIRegular antigen testing twice a week, or weekly PCR testing, significantly reduces infections even when using tests with a lower sensitivity: tests with a 40% sensitivity reduce infections by more than 50 percent. C_LIO_LIThe density of revealed contact graphs for older pupils is 1.5 times higher than the younger pupils graph, the teachers network is yet an order of magnitude denser. Consequently, the infection transmission between teachers is highly overproportional in our school. Moreover, teachers act as bridges connecting clusters of classes, especially in the secondary grade where they are responsible for 14-18% of infections, in comparison to 8-11% in primary grade. C_LI InterpretationWeekly rotations with regular testing are a highly effective non-pharmaceutical intervention for the prevention of covid-19 spread in schools and a way to keep schools open during an epidemic or to reopen them as the epidemiological situation improves.","Brom, Cyril; Diviak, Tomas; Drbohlav, Jakub; Korbel, Vaclav; Levinsky, Rene; Neruda, Roman; Suchoparova, Gabriela; Slerka, Josef; Smid, Martin; Trnka, Jan; Vidnerova, Petra",,349,29

METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study of the right eyes of 181 subjects: 89 POAG patients and 92 healthy subjects. Using the Triton SS-OCT device (Topcon, Tokyo, Japan), CM length (CML), area (CMA) and thickness measured 1000 µm (CMT1), 2000 µm (CMT2) and 3000 µm (CMT3) from the scleral spur were determined in the temporal and nasal quadrants. POAG patients were subjected to visual field (VF) and peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) assessment. CM dimensions were then assessed for correlation with VF mean defect (MD), mean RNFL thickness and intraocular pressure (IOP). RESULTS: Mean CMLs were 4325 ± 340 µm and 4195 ± 843 µm for the healthy subjects and POAG patients, respectively (p = 0.17). Mean CM thicknesses were CMT1 = 546 ± 56 µm, CMT2 = 326 ± 44 µm and CMT3 = 174 ± 16 µm in the healthy eyes versus CMT1 = 534 ± 108, CMT2 = 332 ± 99 and CMT3 = 183 ± 74 in the POAG eyes, with no significant differences detected (all p &#8805; 0.25). In the temporal quadrant, mean CMA was 1.12 ± 0.29 mm2 and 1.15 ± 0.24 mm2 for the healthy and POAG subjects, respectively (p = 0.45). No correlations were observed between CM measurements and RNFL thickness (p &#8805; 0.15), IOP or VF MD (p &#8805; 0.14) in POAG subjects irrespective of glaucoma severity (p &#8805; 0.19). CONCLUSIONS: While SS-OCT proved useful to measure CM dimensions in vivo, these dimensions did not differ between healthy individuals and POAG subjects. In the patients with POAG, no correlations were detected between CM dimensions and VF, RNFL or IOP.","Kudsieh, Bachar; Fernández-Vigo, José Ignacio; Shi, Hang; De Pablo Gómez de Liaño, Lucía; Ruiz-Moreno, José María; García-Feijóo, Julián; Fernández-Vigo, José Ángel",Int. ophthalmol,349,29

However, given the large pool of susceptible individuals that remain, complete relaxation of controls is likely to generate a substantial further outbreak. Vaccination remains the only foreseeable means of both containing the infection and returning to normal interactions and behaviour. Here, we consider the optimal targeting of vaccination within the UK, with the aim of minimising future deaths or quality adjusted life year (QALY) losses. We show that, for a range of assumptions on the action and efficacy of the vaccine, targeting older age groups first is optimal and may be sufficient to stem the epidemic if the vaccine prevents transmission as well as disease.","Moore, Sam; Hill, Edward M; Dyson, Louise; Tildesley, Michael J; Keeling, Matt J",PLoS Comput Biol,349,15

We found that co-infection with H1N1 and SARS-CoV-2 extended the duration of clinical manifestation of COVID-19, and enhanced pulmonary damage, but reduced viral shedding of throat swabs and viral loads in the lungs of ferrets. Moreover, mortality was increased in sequentially infected mice compared with single-infection mice.

In a general sense, acute and chronic inflammation are different types of adaptive response that are called into action when other homeostatic mechanisms are insufficient. Although considerable progress has been made in understanding the cellular and molecular events that are involved in the acute inflammatory response to infection and tissue injury, the causes and mechanisms of systemic chronic inflammation are much less known. The pathogenic capacity of this type of inflammation is puzzling and represents a common link of the multifactorial diseases, such as cardiovascular diseases and type 2 diabetes. In recent years, interest has been raised by the discovery of novel mediators of inflammation, such as microRNAs and adipokines, with different effects on target tissues. In the present review, we discuss the data emerged from research of leptin in obesity as an inflammatory mediator sustaining multifactorial diseases and how this knowledge could be instrumental in the design of leptin-based manipulation strategies to help restoration of abnormal immune responses. On the other direction, chronic inflammation, either from autoimmune or infectious diseases, or impaired microbiota (dysbiosis) may impair the leptin response inducing resistance to the weight control, and therefore it may be a cause of obesity. Thus, we are reviewing the published data regarding the role of leptin in inflammation, and the other way around, the role of inflammation on the development of leptin resistance and obesity.","Pérez-Pérez, Antonio; Sánchez-Jiménez, Flora; Vilariño-García, Teresa; Sánchez-Margalet, Víctor",,349,24

MATERIALS & METHODS: In a COVID-19 ICU-patient, the tongue became grotesquely swollen, hardened and protruding from the oral cavity after 20 h of mechanical ventilation uninterrupted in the prone position. To assess the doubtful viability of the tongue, pulse-oximetric hemoglobin O2-saturation (SpO2; Nellcor, OxiMax MAX-NI, Covidien, MA, USA) and NIRS-based, regional tissue O2-saturation measurements (rSO2; SenSmart, Nonin, MN, USA) were performed at the tongue. RESULTS: At the tongue, regular pulse-oximetric waveforms with a pulse-oximetric hemoglobin O2-saturation (SpO2) of 88% were recorded, i.e. only slightly lower than the SpO2 reading at the extremities at that time (90%). Lingual NIRS-based rSO2 measurements yielded stable tissue rSO2-values of 76-78%, i.e. values expected also in other adequately perfused and oxygenated (muscle-) tissues. CONCLUSION: Despite the alarming, clinical finding of a grotesquely swollen, rubber-hard tongue and clinical concerns on the adequacy of the tongue perfusion and oxygenation, our measurements of both arterial pulsatility (SpO2) and NIRS-based tissue oxygenation (rSO2) suggested adequate perfusion and oxygenation of the tongue, rendering non-vitality of the tongue, e.g. by lingual venous thrombosis, unlikely. To our knowledge, this is the first clinical report of lingual rSO2 measurement.","Schober, Patrick; Lust, Erik J; Heunks, Leo M A; Schwarte, Lothar A",J Intensive Care Med,349,26

Data about the sequelae after infection are scarce. The study aims to describe the prevalence of symptoms, pulmonary function tests (PFTs), and radiological changes after four months of follow-up. METHODS: A prospective, cross-sectional, multicentre study was performed. Patients with different illness severities were consecutively included (mild; moderate: hospitalized without IMV; severe: hospitalized with IMV). Clinical variables, health-related quality of life (HRQoL), PFT (spirometry, diffusing capacity of the lungs for carbon monoxide (DLCO)), and (CT) scans of the chest were obtained. The association between the risk of sequelae (DLCO <80%) and altered CT was analysed using logistic regression adjusted for confounding variables. RESULTS: 60 patients (18 mild, 17 moderate, and 25 severe) were included. Fatigue was found in 11% of the mild, 47% of the moderate and 36% of the severe group. Altered DLCO (mild: 5.5%, moderate: 41%, severe: 28%, p < .05) and change in HRQoL (mild: 50%, moderate: 94%, severe: 60%), while the severe group showed a higher prevalence of altered CT (88% vs. 64%).

It is different from the temporary, partial, and limited pollution control measures taken to ensure the regional environmental quality during several important events such as the 2008 Beijing Olympic Games and the 2014 Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC). During the COVID-19 epidemic period, extensive movement of people and almost all unnecessary industrial production (necessary industrial production refers to the production of food, epidemic prevention materials, etc.) have been severely restricted, so transportation and industrial production have been greatly reduced. This is a rare extreme emission reduction scenario that presents a unique opportunity for atmospheric research. In this study, based on hourly mass concentration data of NO2 and SO2 from atmospheric monitoring sites in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei (BTH) region during the COVID-19 epidemic period, the changes in transportation and industrial production in the region, data statistics, and spatial analysis were used to analyze the pollution changes and their causes. The results indicate that the NO2 and SO2 concentrations in the BTH region decreased significantly during the epidemic period. The spatial distribution pattern of NO2 pollution in the BTH region was ""high in the southeast and low in the northwest,"" and SO2 pollution in the BTH region was high in the southern and eastern parts of Hebei. The initiation of emergency response level 1 had an obvious effect on reducing NO2 and SO2 pollution in the region, while the impact of emergency response level 2 and below was limited. Compared with the single traffic control, the comprehensive control, similar to the emergency response, had a better effect on reducing NO2 pollution in the region. The control of major large cities in the region also had a certain effect on alleviating NO2 and SO2 pollution in the entire region. Moreover, for activities under short-term control, it is particularly important to guard against the ""retaliatory growth"" after the control is lifted. By reducing and controlling some polluting industries in industrial production, the degree of NO2 and SO2 pollution in the region can be effectively reduced. The manufacturing industry of chemical raw materials and the chemical products and non-metallic mineral products industry made a great contribution to the change in industrial source pollution emissions in the BTH region during the COVID-19 epidemic. Road traffic emissions remained an important source of NO2 emissions in the BTH region during this period. NO2 emission reduction can be effectively achieved by controlling road traffic and transportation.","Shen, Nanchi; Zhao, Xue; Li, Lingjun; Zhou, Bingfeng; Duan, Fuzhou; Zhao, Wenji",Air Qual Atmos Health,349,29

The lockdown impacted several aspects of life including the economy. Food security became a growing concern for many households. AIM: The aim of the study was to explore the diet diversity of urban households in India during the nationwide COVID-19 lockdown. METHODS: Information regarding socioeconomic status (SES), family size and information regarding availability and access to food were gathered from 450 households. Diet diversity was assessed using a 69-item food frequency questionnaire. Food variety scores (FVS) were computed for individual food groups and overall. RESULTS: The majority of the households (86.4%) belonged to the upper-middle or upper SES. Households did not experience any constraints in accessibility and availability of food except the meat group. Overall, 84% of the households had low FVS for most of the food groups except for sugar and milk and milk products. The household SES score was positively associated with the milk FVS (B = 0.039, p = 0.020) and negatively with the fat FVS (B = -0.062, p < 0.001). The number of adults (B = 6.773, p < 0.001) in the household positively predicted the FVS of cereal, vegetable, fruit, fat and total FVS. CONCLUSIONS: The higher SES households in urban India did not experience food insecurity. Despite this, their poor diet diversity is a serious cause for concern, especially in the wake of the evolving pandemic. This highlights the need to promote consumption of a diverse variety of foods.","Aneesh, Mitravinda; Patil, Rita S",Nutr Health,349,33

Often, it is impractical to apply these recommendations to resource-restricted settings, particularly in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). We report on a set of pragmatic recommendations for acute respiratory failure and mechanical ventilation management in patients with severe/critical COVID-19 in LMICs. We suggest starting supplementary oxygen when SpO2 is persistently lower than 94%. We recommend supplemental oxygen to keep SpO2 at 88-95% and suggest higher targets in settings where continuous pulse oximetry is not available but intermittent pulse oximetry is. We suggest a trial of awake prone positioning in patients who remain hypoxemic; however, this requires close monitoring, and clear failure and escalation criteria. In places with an adequate number and trained staff, the strategy seems safe. We recommend to intubate based on signs of respiratory distress more than on refractory hypoxemia alone, and we recommend close monitoring for respiratory worsening and early intubation if worsening occurs. We recommend low-tidal volume ventilation combined with FiO2 and positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) management based on a high FiO2/low PEEP table. We recommend against using routine recruitment maneuvers, unless as a rescue therapy in refractory hypoxemia, and we recommend using prone positioning for 12-16 hours in case of refractory hypoxemia (PaO2/FiO2 < 150 mmHg, FiO2 &#8805; 0.6 and PEEP &#8805; 10 cmH2O) in intubated patients as standard in ARDS patients. We also recommend against sharing one ventilator for multiple patients. We recommend daily assessments for readiness for weaning by a low-level pressure support and recommend against using a T-piece trial because of aerosolization risk.","Serpa Neto, Ary; Checkley, William; Sivakorn, Chaisith; Hashmi, Madiha; Papali, Alfred; Schultz, Marcus J",Am. j. trop. med. hyg,349,16

Previous research focuses on flight and railway passenger travel behavior and patterns, but China also has numerous suburban residents with a not-high economic level; investigating their travel behaviors is significant for national stability. However, estimating the impacts of the COVID-19 for suburban residents' travel behaviors remains challenging because of lacking apposite data. Here we submit bus ticketing data including approximately 26,000,000 records from April 2020-August 2020 for 2705 stations. Our results indicate that Suburban residents in Chinese Southern regions are more likely to travel by bus, and travel frequency is higher. Associated with the economic level, we find that residents in the economically developed region more likely to travel or carry out various social activities. Considering from the perspective of the traveling crowd, we find that men and young people are easier to travel by bus; however, they are exactly the main workforce. The indication of our findings is that suburban residents' travel behavior is affected profoundly by economy and consistent with the inherent behavior patterns before the COVID-19 outbreak.

Although it has not been widely used in outpatient neurosurgery settings, the COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) pandemic has necessitated a broader adoption. Our goal is to show the level of patient satisfaction with their telemedicine care. METHODS: We prospectively studied consecutive telemedicine patients who scheduled outpatient neurosurgery visits from May 15 to June 8, 2020. Patients were seen by the surgeon via real-time video conferencing using Google Meet, and then completed a telemedicine satisfaction survey. Our primary outcome was telemedicine satisfaction scores. We compared satisfaction scores between new and established patients and between patients within and outside of a 15-mile radius of the nearest clinic location. Sensitivity analyses were performed to account for the nonrespondents. Descriptive and univariate analyses were performed. A P value of <0.05 was considered significant. RESULTS: Five-hundred and ninety patients completed a telemedicine visit during the study period. One patient from out of state was excluded. Three-hundred and ten patients (52.6%) responded. The average age was 60.9 ± 13.60 years; 59% were female, 20.6% were new patients; the average distance to the clinic was 28.03 ± 36.09 km (17.42 ± 22.43 miles). The mean overall satisfaction score was 6.32 ± 1.27. Subgroup analyses by new/established patient status and distance from their home to the clinic showed no significant difference in mean satisfaction scores between groups.

This is likely to harm the development of new therapeutic strategies and their translation into the clinic in the long term. Recently, the need to maintain continuity in research activities in those fields has assumed even greater importance due to the accumulation of data concerning the effects of SARS-CoV-2 on the musculoskeletal system. This study is aimed at the identification of a series of safe handling practices against COVID-19 diffusion to apply in a research environment, thus allowing the maintenance of research lab activities. METHODS: The control measures to apply to mitigate the COVID-19 risk were identified and categorized utilizing the Hierarchy of Controls. We also compared our analysis with that assessed before the pandemic to consider the additional risk of COVID-19. RESULTS: Results highlighted that the most relevant implemented measures to control SARS-CoV-2 were based on protecting people through engineering (e.g., ventilation and social distancing), and administrative (e.g., hand sanitization, work shifts) measures or Personnel Protective Equipment, rather than eliminating hazards at the source (e.g., smart working). CONCLUSIONS: Work continuity in research labs during the COVID-19 emergency should be guaranteed by ensuring the protection of researchers in the workplace and considering the physical environment, the type of operators and work activity, and the proven ability of workers to face biological risks.

After equivalent coronavirus, the target DNA is separated from DNA-RNA hybridized double strand by heating, which can partly hybridize with probe 2 modified on the electrode surface and probe 1 on AuNPs' surface. Thus, AuNPs are pulled to the surface of the electrode and the abundant DNA on AuNPs' surface could adsorb a large amount of hexaammineruthenium (III) chloride (RuHex) molecules, which produce a remarkably amplified electrochemical response. The voltammetric signal of RuHex with a peak near - 0.28 V vs. Ag/AgCl is used as the signal output. The proposed method shows a detection range of 1.56e-9 to 1.56e-6 µM with the detection limit of 2.96e-10 µM for IBV H120 strain selective quantification detection, exhibiting good accuracy, stability, and simplicity, which shows a great potential for IBV detection in vaccine research and avian infectious bronchitis diagnosis.

E-cigarette flavors has driven adolescents to use these convenient, USB-like devices, designed to create a desired social image, while being seemingly unaware of the serious health consequences of their behavior. Vaping impacts protective pulmonary barriers by attenuating the mucociliary clearance and by increasing peribronchial inflammation and fibrosis. The recent SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) pandemic has been characterized by a plethora of unusual disease presentations. Among them, a unique presentation seen exclusively in children and adolescents was multisystem inflammatory syndrome (MIS-C). Seventy percent of adolescents who had MIS-C also had acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and we speculate that there may exist common denominator that links MIS-C and adolescents: the use of e-cigarettes. The virus targets the angiotensin converting receptor (ACE receptor), and studies have shown nicotine-based e-cigarettes or vaping cause oxidative stress and resulting in the upregulation of ACE2, which might worsen ARDS in MIS-C. Our mini-review highlights that adolescents using e-cigarette have alterations in their pulmonary defenses against SARS-CoV-2: an upregulation of the ACE2 receptors, the primary target of SARS-CoV-2. Their compromised immune system makes them more uniquely vulnerable to Covid-19 related MIS-C, increasing their risk for ARDS and related morbidities. Currently, studies have shown an association between MIS-C and vaping, we speculate that adolescents who vape/smoke might be especially vulnerable to serious respiratory symptoms if they develop a hyper-inflammatory state MIS-C.","Brar, E.; Saxena, A.; Dukler, C.; Xu, F.; Saxena, D.; Cheema Brar, P.; Guo, Y.; Li, X.",Front Pediatr,349,16

While the airborne SARS-CoV-2 primarily affects the lungs, viremia is not uncommon. As placental trophoblasts are directly bathed in maternal blood, they are vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2. Intriguingly, the human fetus is largely spared from SARS-CoV-2 infection. We tested whether the human placenta expresses the main SARS-CoV-2 entry factors angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2), and furin and showed that ACE2 and TMPRSS2 are expressed in the trophoblast rather than in other placental villous cells. While furin is expressed in the main placental villous cell types, we surveyed, trophoblasts exhibit the highest expression. In line with the expression of these entry factors, we demonstrated that a SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus could enter primary human trophoblasts. Mechanisms underlying placental defense against SARS-CoV-2 infection likely involve postentry processing, which may be germane for mitigating interventions against SARS-CoV-2.IMPORTANCE Pregnant women worldwide have been affected by COVID-19. As the virus is commonly spread to various organs via the bloodstream and because human placental trophoblasts are directly bathed in maternal blood, feto-placental infection by SARS-CoV-2 seems likely. However, despite the heightened risk to pregnant women, thus far the transmission risk of COVID-19 to the feto-placental unit seems extremely low. This has been recently attributed to a negligible expression of SARS-CoV-2 entry factors in the human placenta. We therefore sought to explore the expression of the entry factors ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in the different cell types of human placental villi. Using a combination of transcriptome sequencing (RNA-seq), real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR), in situ hybridization, and immunofluorescence, we found that trophoblasts, but not the other main villous cell types, express ACE2 and TMPRSS2, with a broad expression of furin. Correspondingly, we also showed that primary human trophoblasts are permissive to entry of SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus particles.","Ouyang, Yingshi; Bagalkot, Tarique; Fitzgerald, Wendy; Sadovsky, Elena; Chu, Tianjiao; Martínez-Marchal, Ana; Brieño-Enríquez, Miguel; Su, Emily J; Margolis, Leonid; Sorkin, Alexander; Sadovsky, Yoel",MSphere,349,16

Bevezetés: A COVID-19-járvány az egész világon elterjedt. A járvány Európában való elso megjelenése során megfigyelheto volt, hogy a terjedés mértéke kisebb azokban az országokban, ahol a tuberkulózis elleni védekezésül kiterjedt BCG-vakcinációt végeznek. Célkituzés: A jelen munkában olyan összefüggéseket igyekeztünk feltárni, amelyek befolyásolták a járványterjedés paramétereit, különös figyelemmel a BCG-vakcinációs gyakorlatra. Módszerek: A világ összes olyan országára vonatkozóan, ahol megfelelo minoségu statisztikai adatok álltak rendelkezésünkre, vizsgáltuk a járvány terjedésének elso hullámát. A mozgóátlagolt járványgörbéken elemeztük a járvány idotartamát, a tetozés mértékét, a fertozöttek és a halálesetek egymillió lakosra vetített számát. Figyelembe vettük az országok gazdasági mutatóit (GDP, légi forgalom, a tengeri hajózás mértéke). Statisztikai analízis: A vizsgált paraméterek nem mutattak normális eloszlást, így nemparaméteres próbákkal (rangkorreláció, Kruskal-Wallis ANOVA) statisztikai kapcsolatot kerestünk a járványterjedés mértéke, a BCG-vakcináció és más paraméterek között. Eredmények: A járvány gyorsan elterjedt a világon, de mégis, február elso három hetében a terjedésben egy szünet volt megfigyelheto. A járványhullám Európában nagyjából egyszerre ért véget. A járvány által leginkább azok az országok érintettek, ahol nem alkalmaztak rendszeres BCG-vakcinációt, bár a képet bonyolítja, hogy ezek az országok gazdaságilag többnyire fejlettek. A halálozási rátában nem mutatkozott ilyen különbség. Következtetés: Statisztikailag igazolható tény, hogy a vakcinációt végzo országokból az elso hullám alatt kevesebb fertozöttet jelentettek; az ok-okozati összefüggés bizonytalan, hiszen az országok múltja, szokásai, társadalmi berendezkedése, gazdasági fejlettsége nem azonos.

Orv Hetil. 2021; 162(4): 123-134. INTRODUCTION: The new type of coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) epidemic is widespread throughout the world. During the outbreak of the pandemic in Europe it was revealed that the rate of spread was lower in countries where extensive BCG vaccination is used to protect against tuberculosis. OBJECTIVE: In the present work, we sought to explore relationships that influenced epidemic spreading parameters, with particular reference to BCG vaccination practice. METHODS: We examined the first wave of the spread of the epidemic for all countries in the world where adequate quality statistics were available. We analyzed the duration of the epidemic, the extent of the peak, the number of infected people, and the number of deaths per million inhabitants with the moving average of epidemic curves. We took into account the economic indicators of the countries (GDP, air traffic and extent of maritime shipping). STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: The examined parameters did not show a normal distribution, so we looked for a statistical relationship with non-parametric tests (rank correlation, Kruskal-Wallis ANOVA) between the extents of epidemic spread, BCG vaccination and other parameters. RESULTS: The epidemic spread rapidly around the world, but still, in the first three weeks of February, there was a pause in the spread. The first wave of epidemics ended roughly at the same time in Europe. Those countries are the most affected by the epidemic where regular BCG vaccination has not been used, although the picture is complicated by the fact that these countries are mostly economically developed. There was no such difference observable in the mortality rate. CONCLUSION: Although this work clearly demonstrates that during the first wave of the pandemic, fewer infections were reported worldwide in countries where BCG vaccination is obligatory, however, the causal relationship is uncertain, as the countries' past, customs, social organization and economic development are different. Our results support the necessity of comparative contact tracing to clarify how BCG vaccination affects people's susceptibility to this new type of coronavirus as well as their ability to spread and transmit the virus.

METHODS: General and specialistic anamnesis were achieved and oral examination was performed. The following data were collected: age/gender, general symptoms and form of Covid-19, presence and features of taste disorders, day of appearance of the oral lesions, type and features of oral lesions and day of beginning of therapies. If ulcerative lesions did not heal, biopsy was performed. RESULTS: Many types of oral lesions were found and classified into four groups considering the timing of appearance and the start of the therapies. Early lesions in the initial stages of Covid-19 before the start of therapies was observed in 65.9% of the patients. In the histopathological analysis of four early lesions, thrombosis of small and middle size vessels was always noticed with necrosis of superficial tissues. CONCLUSION: The presence of oral lesions in early stages of Covid-19 could represent an initial sign of peripheral thrombosis, a warning sign of possible evolution to severe illness. This suggests that anticoagulant therapies should start as soon as possible.","Favia, Gianfranco; Tempesta, Angela; Barile, Giuseppe; Brienza, Nicola; Capodiferro, Saverio; Vestito, Maria Concetta; Crudele, Lucilla; Procacci, Vito; Ingravallo, Giuseppe; Maiorano, Eugenio; Limongelli, Luisa",,349,16

Despite increasingly stringent containment measures enforced by the government, the health system faced an enormous pressure, and extraordinary efforts were made in order to increase overall hospital beds' availability and especially ICU capacity. Nevertheless, the hardest-hit hospitals in Northern Italy experienced a shortage of ICU beds and resources that led to hard allocating choices. At the beginning of March 2020, the Italian Society of Anesthesia, Analgesia, Resuscitation, and Intensive Care (SIAARTI) issued recommendations aimed at supporting physicians in prioritizing patients when the number of critically ill patients overwhelm the capacity of ICUs. One motivating concern for the SIAARTI guidance was that, if no balanced and consistent allocation procedures were applied to prioritize patients, there would be a concrete risk for unfair choices, and that the prevalent ""first come, first served"" principle would lead to many avoidable deaths. Among the drivers of decision for admission to ICUs, age, comorbidities, and preexisting functional status were included. The recommendations were criticized as ageist and potentially discriminatory against elderly patients. Looking forward to the next steps, the Italian experience can be relevant to other parts of the world that are yet to see a significant surge of COVID-19: the need for transparent triage criteria and commonly shared values give the Italian recommendations even greater legitimacy.","Craxì, Lucia; Vergano, Marco; Savulescu, Julian; Wilkinson, Dominic",Asian Bioeth Rev,349,27

This then enables the robot to observe unhindered task execution, learn the new intent behind it, and add it to this repertoire. We demonstrate with both a case study and a user study that our proposed method maintains good performance when the human's intent is in the robot's repertoire, outperforms prior shared autonomy approaches when it isn't, and successfully learns new skills, enabling efficient lifelong learning for confidence-based shared autonomy.","Zurek, Matthew; Bobu, Andreea; Brown, Daniel S.; Dragan, Anca D.",,349,1

This radiopeptide is made by labelling the ligand octreotate with Lutetium-177 using the linker DOTA. After labelling, and before clinical application quality control of the radiopeptide is needed and the radiochemical purity is assessed. Acceptance limits for radiochemical purity should be within 90-110% of the label claim for radiopharmaceuticals for diagnostic use and within 95-105% of the label claim for radiopharmaceuticals for therapeutic use. Moreover, the amount of unlabelled [177Lu]LuCl3 cannot exceed 2% of the radioactive dose. Since no monograph is available for [177Lu]Lu-DOTA-TATE in the European Pharmacopeia (Ph Eur), this article describes the development and validation of a high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) method with ultraviolet (UV) detection and radiodetection. A Waters Acquity Arc UHPLC system equipped with a Waters 2998 photodiode array (PDA) detector was used coupled to a Berthold Lb 514 Flowstar detector equipped with a BGO-X gamma measuring cell. A reversed phase Symmetry Shield C18 column (4.6 mm × 250 mm, 5 µm) was used for chromatographic separation. A flow of 1.5 mL/min was maintained during analysis, using 0.1% TFA in water as mobile phase A and 0.1% TFA in ACN as mobile phase B. The retention time was around 1.7 min and 13.5 min for [177Lu]LuCl3 and [177Lu]Lu-HA-DOTA-TATE, respectively.

A [177Lu]Lu-HA-DOTA-TATE sample was prepared and injected to determine the carry over. The results showed that the method is linear over a range of 0.300-130 MBq/mL, which covers the range for clinical samples, provided that the clinical sample is diluted ten times before analysis. The LLOQ can be measured accurately even after dilution, with a signal-to-noise ratio of at least 5.

Mathematical modeling and field observations have shown that, under seasonal variation, the incidence rates of some endemic infectious diseases fluctuate dramatically and the dynamics is often characterized by chaotic oscillations in the absence of specific vaccination programs. In fact, the existence of chaotic behavior has been precisely stated in the literature as a noticeable feature in the dynamics of the classical Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) seasonally forced epidemic model. However, in the context of epidemiology, chaos is often regarded as an undesirable phenomenon associated with the unpredictability of infectious diseases. As a consequence, the problem of converting chaotic motions into regular motions becomes particularly relevant. In this article, we consider the phase control technique applied to the seasonally forced SIR epidemic model to suppress chaos. Interestingly, this method of controlling chaos takes on a clear meaning as a weak perturbation on a seasonal vaccination strategy. Numerical simulations show that the phase difference between the two periodic forces - contact rate and vaccination - plays a very important role in controlling chaos.","Duarte, Jorge; Janu'ario, Cristina; Martins, Nuno; Seoane, Jes'us; Sanju'an, Miguel AF",,349,16

Activity of the Polish legislator is also essential, which tried to introduce solutions that would correspond with current expectations and needs. Given the multiplicity of the introduced regulations, interpretation of provisions of statutes has not always been easy. In this paper, the author points to the issues of communication with a public authority by specific reflections on the principles of serving documents on beneficiaries of EU programs under which they were awarded funding for their implementation on the basis of EU regulations addressing the use of the European Regional Development Fund, the European Social Fund and the Cohesion Fund for programs implemented as part of the cohesion policy (Regulations of the European Parliament and of the Council (EU) of 17 December 2013: no. 1303/2013, no. 1301/2013, no. 1304/2013, no 1300/2013, and no. 1299/2013). The author focuses on the issues of communication with an authority in a situation where administrative proceedings are initiated against a beneficiary of EU funds, e.g., for returning the granted funding. The author points to the dynamics of the legislator's work in this respect by analyzing the rules for serving documents by a public authority on beneficiaries who are public entities and those who are not. The author's main research aim is to analyze existing provisions establishing the possibility of electronic communication with a public authority, and also to assess them critically due to the extraordinary situation caused by Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). This is intended to verify the main research hypothesis focusing on the attempt to answer a question whether existing regulations, and those created at the time of the epidemic threat and the state of epidemic in Poland facilitate citizens' electronic communication with a public authority. The author aims to answer a question about whether the Polish legislator responds appropriately to the numerous emerging challenges associated with the pandemic and whether it created regulations that effectively ensure the possibility of continuity of contact with a public authority for citizens who are the beneficiaries of public funds. This analysis may contribute to the understanding of whether and how it is possible to improve citizens' contact with public authorities, which in the future may eliminate barriers and obstacles arising in this regard. The author bases her reflections on the experience resulting from providing legal services for one of the Polish Managing Authorities of the Regional Operational Programme using at the same time a number of research methods (i.e., the method of interpretation of applicable laws to establish applicable provisions of the law that regulate admissibility of electronic communication with a public authority and to establish efficiency of such communication, the analytical method, applied in reference to the relevant state of the art in the achievements of legal scholarship, and the empirical method, based on observation and analysis of practical issues resulting from the author's cooperation with a Polish managing authority). In her conclusions, the author points to the lack of introduction of comprehensive regulations (also at the EU level-for all EU Member States) in terms of de-formalizing the principles of communication in the course of pending administrative proceedings. The author notices an absence of unambiguous regulations that allow for a scanned document signed by hand and sent my email to be qualified into the category of documents served by electronic means, through use of means of electronic communication. The author assesses this absence negatively due to the fact that such action seems the simplest in a situation caused by COVID-19.","Klich, Aleksandra",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),349,20

A higher ratio, indicative of an acute hyperinflammatory response or diminished overall physiologic health status, has been associated with poor prognoses. This study aimed to evaluate the prognostic potential of admission neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio in patients admitted to the medical ICU with coronavirus disease 2019. Design: Retrospective review of prospectively collected data. Setting: Medical ICU from a large medical center. Patients: 2,071 consecutive patients admitted to the medical ICU with laboratory-confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 between March 15, 2020, and December 30, 2020, were grouped by neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio above or below the median (7.45) at the time of hospital admission. Interventions: Complete blood count with differential at the time of hospital admission. Measurements and Main Results: A neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio above 7.45 at the time of hospital admission was associated with increased need for mechanical ventilation (45.8% vs 38.0%, p &lt; 0.0001), vasopressor therapy (55.6% vs 48.2%, p = 0.001), and decreased survival through 180 days (54.8% vs 67.0%, p &lt; 0.0001). Patients with a high neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio exhibited a 1.32 (95% CI, 1.14-1.54) times greater risk of mortality than those with a low neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio. Conclusions: The neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio at the time of hospital admission is an independent risk factor for morbidity and mortality. This prognostic indicator may assist clinicians appropriately identify patients at heightened risk for a severe disease course and tailor treatment accordingly.","King, A.

DESIGN: 213 adolescents attended private clinics at two different times: before lockdown (T0) and after completion of total lockdown (T1). In T0 and T1 a clinical examination was carried out to assess dental wear (IA) and only in T1 were they given the self-report questionnaire which focuses on the periods before and during lockdown (self-reported bruxism, state-anxiety, mobile phone and internet, social network use, physical and social activity and questions on parafunctions). RESULTS: There was a decrease in physical activity at T0-T1 and an increase in social media use, internet, state-anxiety, clinical and self-reported bruxism at T0-T1. There was a positive correlation between increased self-reported bruxism, increased social media use, mobile device use and state-anxiety. CONCLUSIONS: There has been a change in adolescent lifestyle during lockdown with an increase in the appearance of oral parafunctions and bruxism. In particular, the increase in the use of social networks at night and also in anxiety levels during lockdown are predictors of the increase in self-reported bruxism.","Carrillo Diaz, María; Ortega Martínez, Ana Raquel; Romero Maroto, Martín; González Olmo, María José",Int. j. paediatr. dent,349,1

METHODS: We launched an online survey in La Paz and El Alto, Bolivia, during April and May 2020. The questionnaire examined: Socio-demographic factors, Social media use, Risk Perception, Preventive behaviors, attitudes and the willingness to use a vaccine if it were available in the context of the COVID-19 epidemic. A logistic regression was used to evaluate factors associated with risk perception and a structural equation model (SEM) was performed to explore the pathway of the relationship among social media exposure, risk perception and preventive behaviors and attitudes. RESULTS: Among 886 participants, the most were young adults, between 18-25 years old (73.4%) and 577 (65.1%) were female. During the the week before the survey 387 (43.7%) reported be exposure to social media Covid-19 information almost always or always. Moreover 304 (34.3%) were categorized as with a high risk perception. The multivariable analyses show that being female (aOR = 1.5, CI 95% 1.1-2.1) and having high exposure to Covid-19 information on social media (aOR = 2.5, CI 95% 1.3-5.3) were associated with a higher risk perception for Covid-19. Furthermore, SEM results indicated that risk perception is associated with the adoption of preventive behaviors and attitudes (ß = 0.605, p < 0.001) including the acceptance of a vaccine if one were available (ß = 0.388, p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Social media exposure to COVID-19 information influences the adoption of preventive attitudes and behaviors through shaping risk perception. Understanding the role of social media during the pandemic could help policymakers and communicators to develop better communication strategies that enable the population to adopt appropriate attitudes and behaviors.","Zeballos Rivas, Diana Reyna; Lopez Jaldin, Marinalda Lidia; Nina Canaviri, Blanca; Portugal Escalante, Luisa Fabiola; Alanes Fernández, Angela M C; Aguilar Ticona, Juan Pablo",PLoS One,349,22

At a high level, ACOUSTIC-TURF adaptively broadcasts inaudible ultrasonic signals with randomly generated IDs in the vicinity. Simultaneously, the system receives other ultrasonic signals sent from nearby (e.g., 6 feet) users. In such a system, individual user IDs are not disclosed to others and the system can accurately detect encounters in physical proximity with 6-foot granularity. We have implemented a prototype of ACOUSTIC-TURF on Android and evaluated its performance in terms of acoustic-signal-based encounter detection accuracy and power consumption at different ranges and under various occlusion scenarios. Experimental results show that ACOUSTIC-TURF can detect multiple contacts within a 6-foot range for mobile phones placed in pockets and outside pockets. Furthermore, our acoustic-signal-based system achieves greater precision than wireless-signal-based approaches when contact tracing is performed through walls. ACOUSTIC-TURF correctly determines that people on opposite sides of a wall are not in contact with one another, whereas the Bluetooth-based approaches detect nonexistent contacts among them.","Luo, Yuxiang; Zhang, Cheng; Zhang, Yunqi; Zuo, Chaoshun; Xuan, Dong; Lin, Zhiqiang; Champion, Adam C.; Shroff, Ness",,349,1

The Australian Healthier Wealthier Families project seeks to reduce the childhood inequities caused by poverty and deprivation by creating a systematic referral pathway between two free, community-based services: universal, well-child nursing services, which provide health and development support to families with children from birth to school entry, and financial counselling. By adapting the successful Scottish 'Healthier Wealthier Children' model, the objectives of this Australian pilot are to test the (1) feasibility of systematising the referral pathway, and (2) short-term impacts on household finances, caregiver health, parenting efficacy and financial service use. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This pilot randomised controlled trial will run in three sites across two Australian states (Victoria and New South Wales), recruiting a total of 180 participants. Nurses identify eligible caregivers with a 6-item, study-designed screening survey for financial hardship. Caregivers who report one or more risk factors and consent are randomised. The intervention is financial counselling. The comparator is usual care plus information from a government money advice website. Feasibility will be evaluated using the number/proportion of caregivers who complete screening, consent and research measures, and access financial counselling. Though powered to assess feasibility, impacts will be measured 6 months post-enrolment with qualitative interviews and questionnaires about caregiver-reported income, loans and costs (adapted from national surveys, for example, the Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia Survey); health (General Health Questionnaire 1, EuroQol five-dimensional questionnaire, Depression, Anxiety, Stress Scale short-form); efficacy (from the Longitudinal Study of Australian Children); and financial service use (study-designed) compared between arms. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethics committees of the Royal Children's Hospital (HREC/57372/RCHM-2019) and South West Sydney Local Health District (2019/ETH13455) have approved the study.

A utilização de células tronco mesenquimais (CTMs) nestes casos visa modificar a progressão desta enfermidade. O objetivo do presente trabalho foi verificar o comportamento das CTMs alogênicas derivadas da membrana sinovial (CTMms) frente aos eventos inflamatórios em casos de sinovite aguda em equinos. A sinovite foi induzida utilizando 0,5ng de LPS via intra-articular (IA) e os animais foram tratados 8 horas após a indução. O grupo controle recebeu como tratamento 2 ml de PBS IA, enquanto o grupo tratado recebeu 107 CTMms IA. Foram realizados, de maneira seriada, exames físicos, exames do aparelho locomotor, análise citológica do líquido sinovial e a determinação da concentração sinovial de TGF- e PGE2. Não foram observadas diferenças entre os grupos quanto à claudicação e parâmetros do exame físico. A análise citológica revelou diminuição significativa de linfócitos e macrófagos no grupo tratado (P= 0,0059 e P= 0,0003, respectivamente) que também apresentou menores níveis de TGF- (P= 0,0467) no momento 24h. Os demais parâmetros não apresentaram diferença significativa em nenhum momento. Os dados avaliados sugerem que a inflamação aguda tenha inicialmente causado inibição da capacidade imunomoduladora das CTMs, que foi retomada após 24h, com o declínio da inflamação articular, e que a interação das CTMs com os mediadores inflamatórios presentes no líquido sinovial está diretamente relacionada à condição inflamatória articular no momento da aplicação.

The problem persists, with a happy ending not yet fully visible, even if, in due course, medical science discovers ways to reduce or eliminate this pandemic. The negative impact of the disease on people’s lives has been enormous, with millions of dead people, while at the same time it affected the global economy as well as social cohesion, making life difficult for people. Culture was also a major victim of the pandemic, as the direct contacts of artists and experts with the works of art of the world cultural heritage were immediately cut off. Greece felt the negative consequences in this area, as its history and culture are linked to tourism and the promotion of its cultural heritage has suffered a major blow. Masterpieces from the past, of great his-torical importance and aesthetic value, were found in isolation as the difficulties of being approached by the international public seemed to be unsurpassed. However, “Necessity and the gods are convinced”, as the ancient greeks said, so the Greek museums entered-with an unprecedented dynamism- in modern technologies and in the age of digital image, in order not to stop the “contact” of the public with the rich world of art. Therefore, at an extremely fast pace, special virtual tour programs were implemented and displayed in museums and places of culture and as it turned out, the attendance showed high numbers, as the cultural project became a “product” with the aim to be perceived by the cyber public as an intangible object with dimensions outside the “established” aesthetic pleasure. Furthermore, the result is considered to be particularly encouraging as the operation of the museums has acquired a new dynamic, a necessary condition in the functioning of the modern world. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Tsichla, M.

The utility of SSDs has been well reviewed and they are viewed as a high tier assessment tool in environmental risk assessment and other disciplines. SSDs seek to improve upon probabilistic extrapolation of laboratory (and sometimes field) collected ecotoxicity data for environmental protection by modeling the diversity of multiple experimental results in the form of a single statistical distribution which reduces or eliminates the need for extrapolation with deterministic assessment factors. SSDs thus depend heavily on both statistical and biological knowledge. In this commentary we review recently published literature identifying areas of improvement based on fundamental statistical theory or application in environmental assessment contexts. We reveal that sound application of SSDs relies heavily upon a grasp of probability distributions, how asymmetric confidence intervals are derived for distributions common to SSDs, the influence of sample size on parameter estimation, and how these are collectively applied across the myriad of regulatory systems globally. Statisticians and ecotoxicologists are inextricably bound together in the goal of actually improving hazard assessment using both probabilistic and deterministic methodologies.","Belanger, Scott E; Carr, Gregory J",Ecotoxicol Environ Saf,349,15

To mitigate the B.1.617.1 variant of SARS-CoV-2, deciphering the protein structure and immunological responses by employing bioinformatics tools for data mining and analysis is pivotal. OBJECTIVES: Here, an in silico approach was employed for deciphering the structure and immune function of the subunit of spike (S) protein of SARS-CoV-2 B.1.617.1 variant. METHODS: The partial amino acid sequence of SARS-CoV-2 B.1.617.1 variant S protein was analyzed, and its putative secondary and tertiary structure was predicted. Immunogenic analyses including B- and T-cell epitopes, interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) response, chemokine, and protective antigens for SARS-CoV 2 S proteins were predicted using appropriate tools. RESULTS: B.1.617.1 variant S protein sequence was found to be highly stable and amphipathic. ABCpred and CTLpred analyses led to the identification of two potential antigenic B cell and T cell epitopes with starting amino acid positions at 60 and 82 (for B cell epitopes) and 54 and 98 (for T cell epitopes) having prediction scores > 0.8. Further, RAMPAGE tool was used for determining the allowed and disallowed regions of the three-dimensional predicted structure of SARS-CoV-2 B.1.617.1 variant S protein. CONCLUSION: Together, the in silico analysis revealed the predicted structure of partial S protein, immunogenic properties, and possible regions for S protein of SARS-CoV-2 and provides a valuable prelude for engineering the targeted vaccine or drug against B.1.617.1 variant of SARS-CoV-2.","Srivastava, Vijay Kumar; Kaushik, Sanket; Bhargava, Gazal; Jain, Ajay; Saxena, Juhi; Jyoti, Anupam",Biomed Res Int,349,28

Increased antimicrobial resistance was observed for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA)s, extended spectrum beta-lactamase producing (ESBL) Enterobacterales, carbapenem-resistant (CR) Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii and Klebsiella pneumoniae. No vancomycin resistance was found for Enterococcus faecium. The highest prevalence rates of multidrug resistance were found in methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (86.6%), Acinetobacter baumannii (36.8%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (29.1%) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (24.4%). CONCLUSION: ESKAPE pathogens are frequently isolated in the infectious diseases hospital, with main antimicrobial resistance: ESBL, MRSA and CR. The local antimicrobial resistance pattern is essential in updating the local protocols and for appropriately prescribing antibiotics. Streamlining microbiological diagnosis and aligning with the European standards for antimicrobial susceptibility testing are necessary steps in harmonizing the regional network for good antimicrobial resistance control practices.","Arbune, Manuela; Gurau, Gabriela; Niculet, Elena; Iancu, Alina Viorica; Lupasteanu, Gabriela; Fotea, Silvia; Vasile, Mihaela Camelia; Tatu, Alin Laurentiu",Infect Drug Resist,349,22

The oceans provide benefits to humans such as food, coastal protection and improved mental well-being, but can also impact negatively via natural disasters. At the same time, humans influence ocean health, for example, via coastal development or through environmental stewardship. Given the strong feedbacks between ocean and human health there is a need to promote desirable interactions, while minimising undesirable interactions. To this end, we articulate two scenarios for 2030. First, Business-as-Usual, named ‘Command and (out of) Control’, focuses on the anticipated future based on our current trajectory. Second, a more sustainable scenario called ‘Living and Connecting’, emphasises the development of interactions between oceans and society consistent with achieving the Sustainable Development Goals. We describe a potential pathway to achieving the ‘Living and Connecting’ scenario, centred on improving marine citizenship, achieving a more equitable distribution of power among stakeholders, and more equitable access to resources and opportunities. The constituent actions of this pathway can be categorised into four groups: (i) improved approaches to science and health communication that account for society’s diverse values, beliefs and worldviews, (ii) a shift towards more trusted relationships among stakeholders to enable two-way knowledge exchange, (iii) economic incentives that encourage behavioural changes necessary for achieving desired sustainability outcomes, and (iv) stronger regulations that simultaneously focus on ocean and human health. We contend that these changes will provide improved outcomes for both oceans and society over the United Nations Decade of Ocean Science.

There is a lack of research assessing the efficacy of telehealth treatment in more acute, intensive treatment settings such as a partial hospital. In the face of the COVID-19 pandemic, much of ambulatory behavioral health treatment has transitioned to a telehealth, or virtual, format. In the present report from the Rhode Island Methods to Improve Diagnostic Assessment and Services (MIDAS) project, we compared patient satisfaction of partial hospital services delivered via telehealth to in-person treatment provided to patients treated prior to the COVID-19 outbreak. The sample included 240 patients who were treated virtually from May, 2020 to October, 2020, and a comparison group of 240 patients who were treated in the in-person partial program a year earlier. Patients completed self-administered measures of patient satisfaction after the initial evaluation and at the end of treatment. For both the in-person and telehealth methods of delivering partial hospital level of care, patients were highly satisfied with the initial diagnostic evaluation and were optimistic at admission that treatment would be helpful. At the completion of treatment, both groups were highly satisfied with all components of the treatment program and almost all would recommend treatment to a friend or family member. Thus, patient satisfaction was as high with telehealth partial hospital treatment as with in-person treatment.","Zimmerman, Mark; Benjamin, Isabel; Tirpak, Julianne Wilner; D'Avanzato, Catherine",Psychiatry Res,349,22

Concerns have been raised about SARS-CoV-2 vaccine responses in the large population of patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). The study aimed to explore the safety and immunogenicity of COVID-19 vaccination in NAFLD. METHODS: This multicenter study included patients with NAFLD without a history of SARS-CoV-2 infection. All patients were vaccinated with 2 doses of inactivated vaccine against SARS-CoV-2. The primary safety outcome was the incidence of adverse reactions within 7 days after each injection and overall incidence of adverse reactions within 28 days, and the primary immunogenicity outcome was neutralizing antibody response at least 14 days after the whole-course vaccination. RESULTS: A total of 381 patients with pre-existing NAFLD were included from 11 designated centers in China. The median age was 39.0 years (IQR 33.0–48.0 years) and 179 (47.0%) were male. The median BMI was 26.1 kg/m(2) (IQR 23.8–28.1 kg/m(2)). The number of adverse reactions within 7 days after each injection and adverse reactions within 28 days totaled 95 (24.9%) and 112 (29.4%), respectively. The most common adverse reactions were injection site pain in 70 (18.4%), followed by muscle pain in 21 (5.5%), and headache in 20 (5.2%). All adverse reactions were mild and self-limiting, and no grade 3 adverse reactions were recorded. Notably, neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 were detected in 364 (95.5%) patients with NAFLD. The median neutralizing antibody titer was 32 (IQR 8-64), and the neutralizing antibody titers were maintained. CONCLUSIONS: The inactivated COVID-19 vaccine appears to be safe with good immunogenicity in patients with NAFLD. LAY SUMMARY: The development of vaccines against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has progressed rapidly, with encouraging safety and efficacy data. This study now shows that the inactivated COVID-19 vaccine appears to be safe with good immunogenicity in the large population of patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.","Wang, Jitao; Hou, Zhiyun; Liu, Jianxin; Gu, Ye; Wu, Yunhong; Chen, Zhenhuai; Ji, Jiansong; Diao, Shiqi; Qiu, Yuanwang; Zou, Shengqiang; Zhang, Aiguo; Zhang, Nina; Wang, Fengxian; Li, Xue; Wang, Yan; Liu, Xing; Lv, Cheng; Chen, Shubo; Liu, Dengxiang; Ji, Xiaolin; Liu, Chao; Ren, Tao; Sun, Jingwei; Zhao, Zhongwei; Wu, Fazong; Li, Fenxiang; Wang, Ruixu; Yan, Yan; Zhang, Shiliang; Ge, Guohong; Shao, Jiangbo; Yang, Shiying; Liu, Chuan; Huang, Yifei; Xu, Dan; Li, Xiaoguo; Ai, Jingwen; He, Qing; Zheng, Ming-Hua; Zhang, Liting; Xie, Qing; Rockey, Don C.; Fallowfield, Jonathan A.; Zhang, Wenhong; Qi, Xiaolong",J Hepatol,349,20

Based on risk data, risk decision making as the standard, risk events as the driving force, and knowledge graph analysis methods as the power, the risk domain knowledge service process is decomposed into three stages: prewarning, in-event response, and postevent summary. These stages are combined with the empirical knowledge of risk event handling to construct a three-level knowledge service model of risk domain knowledge acquisition-organization-application. This model introduces the semantic reasoning and data fusion method to express, organize, and integrate the knowledge needs of different stages of risk events; provide enterprise managers with risk management knowledge service solutions; and provide new growth points for the innovation of interdisciplinary knowledge service theory.","Yang, Bo; Yang, Meifang",Neural Comput Appl,349,12

The gender difference in regards to the severity of coronavirus disease 2019 infection has not been well described thus far. Our aim was to investigate how gender difference can affect the disease severity of coronavirus disease 2019 infection. DATA SOURCES: A comprehensive literature search of PubMed and Embase databases was conducted from December 1, 2019, to March 26, 2020. An additional manual search of secondary sources was conducted to minimize missing relevant studies. There were no language restrictions. STUDY SELECTION: Studies were included in our meta-analysis if it was published in peer-reviewed journals and recorded patient characteristics of severe versus nonsevere or survivor versus nonsurvivor in coronavirus disease 2019 infection. DATA EXTRACTION: Two investigators independently screened the search, extracted the data, and assessed the quality of the study. DATA SYNTHESIS: Our search identified 15 observational studies with a total of 3,494 patients (1,935 males and 1,559 females) to be included in our meta-analysis. Males were more likely to develop severe coronavirus disease 2019 infection compared with females (odds ratio, 1.31; 95% CI, 1.07–1.60). There was no significant heterogeneity (I(2) = 12%) among the studies. CONCLUSIONS: This meta-analysis suggests that the male gender may be a predictor of more severe coronavirus disease 2019 infection.

Essentially, there are two ways of expressing an exogenous protein: the creation of transgenic plants possessing a stably integrated gene construction, or the transient expression of the desired gene following the infiltration of the gene construct. Both depend on disarmed strains of Agrobacterium tumefaciens to deliver the created gene construction into cell nuclei, usually through the deployment of virus‐derived components. The importance of efficient mRNA translation in the latter process is highlighted. Plant viruses replicate to sustain an infection to promote their survival. The major product of this, the virus particle, is finding increasing roles in the emerging field of bionanotechnology. One of the major products of plant‐viral expression is the virus‐like particle (VLP). These are increasingly playing a role in vaccine development. Similarly, many VLPs are suitable for the investigation of the many facets of the emerging field of synthetic biology, which encompasses the design and construction of new biological functions and systems not found in nature. Genetic and chemical modifications to plant‐generated VLPs serve as ideal starter templates for many downstream synthetic biology applications.","Saunders, Keith; Lomonossoff, George P.",New Phytol,349,12

Specific acute phase reactants might be useful for risk stratification. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies of serum amyloid A (SAA) in patients with COVID-19. METHODS: We searched PubMed, Web of Science and Scopus, between January 2020 and December 2020, for studies reporting SAA concentrations, COVID-19 severity and survival status. RESULTS: Nineteen studies in 5,617 COVID-19 patients were included in the meta-analysis. Pooled results showed that SAA concentrations were significantly higher in patients with severe disease and non-survivors (standard mean difference, SMD, 1.20, 95% CI 0.91-1.49, P < 0.001). Extreme between-study heterogeneity was observed (I(2) = 92.4%, P < 0.001).

This study compared the psychiatric status and sleep quality of FHWs during and after the COVID-19 outbreak in China. FHWs who volunteered to work in Hubei province (the COVID-19 epicenter) were assessed at baseline during the COVID-19 outbreak and re-assessed when they returned to their place of origin (Liaoning province) after the COVID-19 outbreak. Participants’ psychiatric status and sleep quality were measured with the Symptom CheckList-90 (SCL-90) and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), respectively. A total of 494 FHWs was assessed at baseline and 462 at follow-up assessments. The prevalence of poor psychiatric status was 10.5% at baseline and increased to 14.9% at the follow-up assessment (P = 0.04). The corresponding figures of poor sleep quality at baseline and follow-up assessment were 16.4% and 27.9%, respectively (P < 0.001). Multiple logistic regression analysis found that severe fatigue (p = 0.003, OR = 1.266, 95% CI = 1.081–1.483), poor sleep quality (p < 0.001, OR = 1.283, 95% CI = 1.171–1.405), and history of pre-existing psychiatric disorders (p < 0.001, OR = 5.085, 95% CI = 2.144–12.06) were independently associated with higher odds of poor psychiatric status among the FHWs. Poor psychiatric status and sleep quality were common among FHWs during the COVID-19 outbreak, and the prevalence increased following their volunteer experiences. This suggests a critical need for longer-term psychological support for this subpopulation.","Zhou, Yifang; Ding, Hailong; Zhang, Yifan; Zhang, Baoyan; Guo, Yingrui; Cheung, Teris; Hall, Brian J.; Shi, Tieying; Xiang, Yu-Tao; Tang, Yanqing",Transl Psychiatry,349,16

Following bioactivity-guided fractionation, eight diterpenoids (1–8) and four biflavonoids (9–12) were isolated and evaluated for SARS-CoV 3CL(pro) inhibition using fluorescence resonance energy transfer analysis. Of these compounds, the biflavone amentoflavone (9) (IC(50) = 8.3 μM) showed most potent 3CL(pro) inhibitory effect.

At the same time, such large-scale population-based designs involving multiple independent sites also must weigh competing demands. For example, the need for efficient, scalable assessment strategies must be balanced with the need for nuanced, developmentally sensitive phenotyping optimized for linkage to neural mechanisms and specification of common and distinct exposure pathways. Standardized epidemiologic batteries designed for this purpose such as PhenX (consensus measures for Phenotypes and eXposures) and the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Toolbox provide excellent “off the shelf” assessment tools that are well-validated and enable cross-study comparability. However, these standardized toolkits can also constrain ability to leverage advances in neurodevelopmental measurement over time, at times disproportionately advantaging established measures. In addition, individual consortia often expend exhaustive effort “reinventing the wheel,” which is inefficient and fails to fully maximize potential synergies with other like initiatives. To address these issues, this paper lays forth an early childhood neurodevelopmental assessment strategy, guided by a set of principles synthesizing developmental and pragmatic considerations generated by the Neurodevelopmental Workgroup of the HEALthy Brain and Child Development (HBCD) Planning Consortium. These principles emphasize characterization of both risk- and resilience-promoting processes. Specific measurement recommendations to HBCD are provided to illustrate application. However, principles are intended as a guiding framework to transcend any particular initiative as a broad neurodevelopmentally informed, early childhood assessment strategy for large-scale consortia science.","Morris, Amanda Sheffield; Wakschlag, Lauren; Krogh-Jespersen, Sheila; Fox, Nathan; Planalp, Beth; Perlman, Susan B.; Shuffrey, Lauren C.; Smith, Beth; Lorenzo, Nicole E.; Amso, Dima; Coles, Claire D.; Johnson, Scott P.",Advers Resil Sci,349,27

DESIGN: Survey of cases. PARTICIPANTS: The study included Québec HCWs from private and public institutions with laboratory-confirmed coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) diagnosed between March 1 and June 14, 2020. HCWs aged ≥18 years who worked during the exposure period and survived their illness were eligible for the survey. METHODS: After obtaining consent, 4,542 HCWs completed a standardized questionnaire. COVID-19 rates and proportions of exposures and practices were estimated and compared between ACHs and LTCFs. RESULTS: HCWs represented 13,726 (25%) of 54,005 reported COVID-19 cases in Québec and had an 11-times greater rate of COVID-19 than non-HCWs. Their secondary household attack rate was 30%. Most affected occupations were healthcare support workers, nurses and nurse assistants working in LTCFs (45%) and ACHs (30%). Compared to ACHs, HCWs in LTCFs had less training, higher staff mobility between working sites, similar PPE use, and better self-reported compliance with at-work physical distancing. Suboptimal IPC practices declined over time but were still present at the end of the first wave. CONCLUSION: Québec HCWs and their families were severely affected during the first wave of COVID-19.

The selection of the operating conditions including the pH of the electrolyte, the stirring speed, and the electrodes disposition is performed by assessing the kinetics of NBB degradation; these parameters are set to 3, 350 rpm and a parallel disposition with a 3 cm inter-electrode distance, respectively. The kinetics of Fe(III) in the electrolyte were monitored using the principles of Fricke dosimetry and simulated numerically. The model showed more than a 96% correlation with the experimental results in both the blank test and the presence of the dye. The effects of H2O2 and NBB concentrations on the degradation of the dye were examined jointly with the evolution of the simulated H2O2, Fe2+, and HOâ¢ concentrations in the electrolyte. The model demonstrated a good correlation with the experimental results in terms of the initial degradation rates, with correlation coefficients exceeding 98%.","Ferkous, Hamza; Kerboua, Kaouther; Hamdaoui, Oualid; Haddour, Naoufel; Alghyamah, Abdulaziz",Molecules (Basel),349,30

Given that use of chemical pesticides, such as organophosphates and carbamates, has known potential health impacts, there are concerns about the safety of agricultural workers, and a need for a better evidence base to underpin regulation and worker education. This study, undertaken in 9 districts in Lao PDR, Thailand and Vietnam, will interview agricultural workers to investigate how they use pesticides, their knowledge of risks and self-protective practices, and their self-reported illness symptoms. In each district researchers will recruit and interview 120 participants engaged in vegetable farming, who have recently used pesticides, making a total of 1080 subjects divided equally between the three study countries. Workers’ degree of pesticides exposure will be determined from acetyl cholinesterase concentrations in capillary blood samples collected using field test kits, and these data will be analysed together with the interview findings. Country findings will be compared and contrasted, and general patterns noted. Knowledge gained about risky behaviours, self-protective practices and degree of association with serious pesticides exposure will assist policy makers and inform health improvement programmes.","Hughes, David; Thongkum, Wisit; Tudpor, Kukiat; Turnbull, Niruwan; Yukalang, Nachalida; Sychareun, Vanphanom; Van Vo, Thang; Win, Latt Latt; Watkins, Alan; Jordan, Sue",PLoS One,349,16

The impact of COVID-19 on urological services in different geographical areas is unknown. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the global impact of COVID-19 on urological providers and the provision of urological patient care. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A cross-sectional, web-based survey was conducted from March 30, 2020 to April 7, 2020. A 55-item questionnaire was developed to investigate the impact of COVID-19 on various aspects of urological services. Target respondents were practising urologists, urology trainees, and urology nurses/advanced practice providers. OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: The primary outcome was the degree of reduction in urological services, which was further stratified by the geographical location, degree of outbreak, and nature and urgency of urological conditions. The secondary outcome was the duration of delay in urological services. RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: A total of 1004 participants responded to our survey, and they were mostly based in Asia, Europe, North America, and South America. Worldwide, 41% of the respondents reported that their hospital staff members had been diagnosed with COVID-19 infection, 27% reported personnel shortage, and 26% had to be deployed to take care of COVID-19 patients. Globally, only 33% of the respondents felt that they were given adequate personal protective equipment, and many providers expressed fear of going to work (47%). It was of concerning that 13% of the respondents were advised not to wear a surgical face mask for the fear of scaring their patients, and 21% of the respondents were advised not to discuss COVID-19 issues or concerns on media. COVID-19 had a global impact on the cut-down of urological services, including outpatient clinic appointments, outpatient investigations and procedures, and urological surgeries. The degree of cut-down of urological services increased with the degree of COVID-19 outbreak. On average, 28% of outpatient clinics, 30% of outpatient investigations and procedures, and 31% of urological surgeries had a delay of >8 wk. Urological services for benign conditions were more affected than those for malignant conditions. Finally, 47% of the respondents believed that the accumulated workload could be dealt with in a timely manner after the COVID-19 outbreak, but 50% thought the postponement of urological services would affect the treatment and survival outcomes of their patients. One of the limitations of this study is that Africa, Australia, and New Zealand were under-represented. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 had a profound global impact on urological care and urology providers. The degree of cut-down of urological services increased with the degree of COVID-19 outbreak and was greater for benign than for malignant conditions. One-fourth of urological providers were deployed to assist with COVID-19 care. Many providers reported insufficient personal protective equipment and support from hospital administration. PATIENT SUMMARY: Coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) has led to significant delay in outpatient care and surgery in urology, particularly in regions with the most COVID-19 cases. A considerable proportion of urology health care professionals have been deployed to assist in COVID-19 care, despite the perception of insufficient training and protective equipment.","Teoh, Jeremy Yuen-Chun; Ong, William Lay Keat; Gonzalez-Padilla, Daniel; Castellani, Daniele; Dubin, Justin M.; Esperto, Francesco; Campi, Riccardo; Gudaru, Kalyan; Talwar, Ruchika; Okhunov, Zhamshid; Ng, Chi-Fai; Jain, Nitesh; Gauhar, Vineet; Wong, Martin Chi-Sang; Wroclawski, Marcelo Langer; Tanidir, Yiloren; Rivas, Juan Gomez; Tiong, Ho-Yee; Loeb, Stacy",Eur Urol,349,26

This study analyzed the prevalence of community-acquired respiratory virus infection and the risk factors for hospitalization of Mexican children with severe bronchiolitis treated in an Emergency department. This retrospective study included 134 children 2 years or younger with severe viral bronchiolitis, and 134 healthy age-matched controls. The study period was September 2012 to January 2015. We determined the viral etiology and coinfections with multiple viruses and compared the risk factors detected in children with severe viral bronchiolitis with those in the control group. A total of 153 respiratory viruses in these 134 patients, single or mixed infections, were identified: respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) type A or B was the most frequently detected (23.6% and 17.6%, respectively), followed by rhinovirus (RV; 16.3%) and parainfluenza virus (PIV) type 3 (12.4%). Coinfections of 2 respiratory viruses were found in 14.2% of cases; all cases had either RSV type A or B with another virus, the most common being parainfluenza virus or rhinovirus. Exposure to cigarette smoking was independently associated with hospitalization for severe bronchiolitis (OR, 3.5; 95% CI, 1.99–6.18; P = .0001), and having completed the vaccination schedule for their age was a protective factor against adverse outcome (OR, 0.55; 95% CI, 0.35–0.87; P = .010).

METHODS: In a territory-wide cohort of 10,445 COVID-19 patients from Hong Kong who were hospitalized between 21(st) January 2020 and 31(st) January 2021, 1544 patients had received dexamethasone during hospitalization. Exposure group consisted of patients who had initiated remdesivir prior to dexamethasone (n=93), or co-initiated the two drugs simultaneously (n=373); whereas non-exposure group included patients who were given remdesivir after dexamethasone (n=149), or those without remdesivir use (n=929). Multiple imputation and inverse probability of treatment weighting for propensity score were applied and hazard ratios (HR) of event outcomes were estimated using Cox regression models. RESULTS: Time to clinical improvement (HR=1.23, 95%CI 1.02-1.49, p=0.032) and positive IgG antibody (HR=1.22, 95%CI 1.02-1.46, p=0.029) were significantly shorter in the exposure group than that of non-exposure. The exposure group had a shorter hospital length of stay by 2.65 days among survivors, lower WHO clinical progression scale scores from five days of follow-up onwards, lower risks of in-hospital death (HR=0.59, 95%CI 0.36-0.98, p=0.042) and composite outcomes; and without experiencing an increased risk of ARDS. Differences in the cumulative direct medical costs between groups were no longer significant from 17 days of follow-up onwards.

First, we apply an extended Kalman filter (EKF) to a discrete-time stochastic augmented compartmental model to estimate the time-varying effective reproduction number ([Formula: see text]). We use daily confirmed cases, active cases, recovered cases, deceased cases, Case-Fatality-Rate (CFR), and infectious time as inputs for the model. Furthermore, we define a Transmission Index (TI) as a ratio between the instantaneous and the maximum value of the effective reproduction number. The value of TI indicates the “effectiveness” of the disease transmission from a contact between a susceptible and an infectious individual in the presence of current measures, such as physical distancing and lock-down, relative to a normal condition. Based on the value of TI, we forecast different scenarios to see the effect of relaxing and tightening public measures.

As observed in other airborne viral infections such as influenza and SARS-CoV-1, healthcare workers are at high risk for infection when performing aerosol-generating medical procedures (AGMP). Additionally, the threats of a global shortage of standard personal protective equipment (PPE) prompted many healthcare workers to explore alternative protective enclosures, such as the “aerosol box” invented by a Taiwanese anesthetist. Our study includes the design process of a protective barrier enclosure and its subsequent clinical implementation in the management of critically ill adults and children infected with SARS-CoV-2. METHODS AND RESULTS: The barrier enclosure was designed for use in our tertiary care facility and named “SplashGuard CG” (CG for Care Givers). The device has been adapted using a multi- and interdisciplinary approach, with collaboration between physicians, respiratory therapists, nurses, and biomechanical engineers. Computer-aided design and simulation sessions throughout the entire process facilitated the rapid and safe implementation of the SplashGuard CG in different settings (intensive care unit, emergency department, and the operating room) during AGMPs such as bag-valve-mask ventilation, nasopharyngeal suctioning, intubation and extubation, and noninvasive ventilation. Indications for use and anticipatory precautions were communicated to all healthcare workers using the SplashGuard CG. The entire process was completed within one month. CONCLUSION: The rapid design, development, and clinical implementation of a new barrier enclosure, the “SplashGuard CG,” was feasible in this time of crisis thanks to close collaboration between medical and engineering teams and the use of recurring simulation sessions to test and improve the initial prototypes. Following this accelerated process, it is necessary to maintain team skills, monitor any undesirable effects, and evaluate and continuously improve this new device.","François, Tine; Tabone, Laurence; Levy, Arielle; Seguin, Laurence Alix; Touré, Taher; Aubin, Carl Eric; Jouvet, Philippe",Crit Care Res Pract,349,16

This study aimed to determine the ongoing trend and upcoming infection status of COVID-19 in county levels of Texas. METHODS: Data were extracted from the following sources: published literature, surveillance, unpublished reports, and websites of Texas Department of State Health Services (DSHS), Natality report of Texas, and WHO Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) Dashboard. The 4-compartment Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Removal (SEIR) mathematical model was used to estimate the current trend and future prediction of basic reproduction number and infection cases in Texas. Because the basic reproduction number is not sufficient to predict the outbreak, we applied the Continuous-Time Markov Chain (CTMC) model to calculate the probability of the COVID-19 outbreak. RESULTS: The estimated mean basic reproduction number of COVID-19 in Texas is predicted to be 2.65 by January 31, 2021. Our model indicated that the third wave might occur at the beginning of May 2021, which will peak at the end of June 2021. This prediction may come true if the current spreading situation/level persists, i.e., no clinically effective vaccine is available, or this vaccination program fails for some reason in this area. CONCLUSION: Our analysis indicates an alarming ongoing and upcoming infection rate of COVID-19 at county levels in Texas, thereby emphasizing the promotion of more coordinated and disciplined actions by policy-makers and the population to contain its devastating impact.","Hassan, Md Nazmul; Mahmud, Md.

Following the Cochrane collaboration guidelines and the PRISMA statement, our systematic search and selection yielded 178 papers covering the period 2010–2015. We observe an increasing trend in published BCMs, frequently coupled to (re)emergence events, and propose a categorization by distinguishing how information translates into preventive actions. Behaviour is usually captured by introducing information as a dynamic parameter (76/178) or by introducing an economic objective function, either with (26/178) or without (37/178) imitation. Approaches using information thresholds (29/178) and exogenous behaviour formation (16/178) are also popular. We further classify according to disease, prevention measure, transmission model (with 81/178 population, 6/178 metapopulation and 91/178 individual-level models) and the way prevention impacts transmission. We highlight the minority (15%) of studies that use any real-life data for parametrization or validation and note that BCMs increasingly use social media data and generally incorporate multiple sources of information (16/178), multiple types of information (17/178) or both (9/178). We conclude that individual-level models are increasingly used and useful to model behaviour changes. Despite recent advancements, we remain concerned that most models are purely theoretical and lack representative data and a validation process.","Verelst, Frederik; Willem, Lander; Beutels, Philippe",J R Soc Interface,349,1

Further, microvascular thrombosis has recently been demonstrated in patients with COVID-19, and has been proposed to mediate the pathogenesis of organ injury in this disease. In many of these conditions, microvascular thrombosis is accompanied by inflammation, an association referred to as thromboinflammation. In this review, we discuss endogenous regulatory mechanisms that prevent thrombosis in the microcirculation, experimental approaches to induce microvascular thrombi, and clinical conditions associated with microvascular thrombosis. A greater understanding of the links between inflammation and thrombosis in the microcirculation is anticipated to provide optimal therapeutic targets for patients with diseases accompanied by microvascular thrombosis.","Bray, Monica A.; Sartain, Sarah A.; Gollamudi, Jahnavi; Rumbaut, Rolando E.",Transl Res,349,16

We sought to determine the differences between rural and academic hospitals in VTE management and disposition of patients during the COVID pandemic. Methods: This retrospective study used data from a quality improvement database to evaluate the management and treatment of patients diagnosed with VTE in our emergency departments during the COVID pandemic between 9/1/2020 and 2/28/2021 in any one of our 6 network locations across NE PA. Three of these sites have affiliations and are considered teaching/academic hospitals, while the other 3 are located in rural settings. Results: Of 454 patients diagnosed with VTE, 291 patients were at our academic hospitals and 163 in our rural hospitals. Data include 235 males and 219 females, with an average age of 58 and 61, respectively. Patients treated for VTE in the rural hospitals had an on average shorter length of stay (LOS) prior to disposition (372 min. rural vs. 404 min. academic, p= 0.204). Further, patients seen in rural settings were less likely to be admitted than in academic settings (45.4% (N=74) rural vs. 59.8% (N=174) academic admit rate). The 30-day return rate for ‘all causes’ following an ED visit was almost 2x greater in the rural setting vs. academic (30.7% (N=50) vs. 17.5% (N=51), respectively). Despite this, the 30-day return rates attributable to VTE were similar (24% (N=12) rural, 23.5% (N=12) academic). At the 6-month mark, return rates attributable to VTE at rural locations were low but had an almost 1.6x higher rate of return (7.7% (N=2) rural vs 4.8% (N=3) academic). Rural locations utilized different rates of DOACs, with rural hospitals using rivaroxaban at a 2x higher rate than academic settings (45.3% (N=34) rural vs 20.2% (N=36) academic). Apixaban was more frequently used at academic vs rural settings (64.0% (N=114) academic vs. 41.3% (N=31) rural). Rural vs academic settings had similar rates of PCP follow-up (89.7% (N=261) vs 81.6% (N=133), respectively).

Persons with disabilities (PWDs) are one of the most vulnerable populations susceptible to marginalization. While there are existing guidelines in the Philippines that aim to assist their basic needs, a call for inclusivity in policymaking for the COVID-19 response is highly advocated. This paper aims to analyze existing policy guidelines concerning the welfare of PWDs in the country based on several policy domains. Methods: Relevant documents were acquired through extensive search of government and nongovernment websites and news agencies. Literature included memorandums, circulars, and news bulletins in the period between January 2020 to May 2021. This study conducted a framework analysis on policies enacted by the Philippine government during the COVID-19 pandemic concerning PWDs. The framework was divided into eight areas: access to (1) information, (2)healthcare, (3) education, and (4) financial support, (5) protection from infection in residential settings, (6) reasonable accommodation, (7) consideration for disabled people facing multiple exclusions, and (8) inclusion to decision-making process. Results: Fifteen PWD related COVID-19 response documents from the Philippines were reviewed and analyzed. Most policies corresponded to themes related to financial support and reasonable accommodations. Most documents were limited to proposals and suggestions with only a few documents including specific details on how the program will be implemented and monitored. Conclusion: The state has proven its cognizance for PWDs; however, implementation and its impact remain to be seen. The government needs to evaluate these efforts to identify gaps and barriers. A comprehensive national database should be implemented to centralize registration of PWDs, and efforts should be made to inform and educate PWDs of their rights and of existing programs. Most importantly, PWDs should be included in the discourse and decision-making process to ensure programs are acceptable and accessible.","Velasco, Jacqueline Veronica; Obnial, Joseph Christian; Pastrana, Adriel; Ang, Hillary Kay; Viacrusis, Paulene Miriel; Lucero-Prisno III, Don Eliseo",Health Promot Perspect,349,1

In addition, ICU admission rates were also significantly higher in patients with AKI (63% vs. 20.7%, p < 0.001). The percentage of patients with AKI who developed cytokine storm was significantly higher than patients without AKI (25.9% vs. 14%, p = 0.009). Furthermore, the in-hospital mortality rate was significantly higher in patients with AKI (47.2% vs. 4.7%, p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: AKI is common in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Furthermore, we show that AKI increases the admission rates to ICU and in-hospital mortality. Our findings suggest that AKI should be effectively managed to prevent the adverse outcomes in COVID-19 patients.","Kanbay, Mehmet; Medetalibeyoglu, Alpay; Kanbay, Asiye; Cevik, Enes; Tanriover, Cem; Baygul, Arzu; Şenkal, Naci; Konyaoglu, Hilal; Akpinar, Timur S.; Kose, Murat; Covic, Adrian; Tukek, Tufan",Int Urol Nephrol,349,3

Still, one health concept is to be adopted widely as a component of mitigation strategies to tackle the ongoing pandemic. Therefore, in terms of the magnitude of infection and potential to transmit SARS-CoV-2 to humans, our surveillance efforts should mainly focus on mustelids (especially minks, ferrets, and others) for early detection and control of infection. This will ensure that SARS-CoV-2 will not get established in the wild animal population of these susceptible species. We agree with Dr. Passarella Teixeira on the possibility of domestic and feral cats acting as an urban reservoir, subsequently transmitting the virus to human beings. However, it is less likely that such a phenomenon will be reported even if it has occurred due to the efficient and extensive human-to-human transmission of SARS-CoV-2.","Sharun, Khan; Saied, AbdulRahman A.; Tiwari, Ruchi; Dhama, Kuldeep",The veterinary quarterly,349,10

COVID-19’s emergence and rapid spread is a global public health and economic crisis. However, investigations into the disease, patient-tracking mechanisms, and case report transmissions are both labor-intensive and slow. OBJECTIVE: The pandemic has overwhelmed health care systems, forcing hospitals and medical facilities to find effective ways to share data. This study aims to design a global infectious disease surveillance and case tracking system that can facilitate the detection and control of COVID-19. METHODS: The International Patient Summary (IPS; an electronic health record that contains essential health care information about a patient) was used. The IPS was designed to support the used case scenario for unplanned cross-border care. The design, scope, utility, and potential for reuse of the IPS for unplanned cross-border care make it suitable for situations like COVID-19. The Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources confirmed that IPS data, which includes symptoms, therapies, medications, and laboratory data, can be efficiently transferred and exchanged on the system for easy access by physicians. To protect privacy, patient data are deidentified. All systems are protected by blockchain architecture, including data encryption, validation, and exchange of records. RESULTS: To achieve worldwide COVID-19 surveillance, a global infectious disease information exchange must be enacted. The COVID-19 surveillance system was designed based on blockchain architecture. The IPS was used to exchange case study information among physicians. After being verified, physicians can upload IPS files and receive IPS data from other global cases. The system includes a daily IPS uploading and enhancement plan, which covers real-time uploading through the interoperation of the clinic system, with the module based on the Open Application Programming Interface architecture. Through the treatment of different cases, drug treatments, and the exchange of treatment results, the disease spread can be controlled, and treatment methods can be funded. In the Infectious Disease Case Tracking module, we can track the moving paths of infectious disease cases. The location information recorded in the blockchain is used to check the locations of different cases. The Case Tracking module was established for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to track cases and prevent disease spread. CONCLUSIONS: We created the IPS of infectious diseases for physicians treating patients with COVID-19. Our system can help health authorities respond quickly to the transmission and spread of unknown diseases, and provides a system for information retrieval on disease transmission. In addition, this system can help researchers form trials and analyze data from different countries. A common forum to facilitate the mutual sharing of experiences, best practices, therapies, useful medications, and clinical intervention outcomes from research in various countries could help control an unknown virus. This system could be an effective tool for global collaboration in evidence-based efforts to fight COVID-19.","Lee, Hsiu-An; Kung, Hsin-Hua; Lee, Yuarn-Jang; Chao, Jane C-J; Udayasankaran, Jai Ganesh; Fan, Hueng-Chuen; Ng, Kwok-Keung; Chang, Yu-Kang; Kijsanayotin, Boonchai; Marcelo, Alvin B; Hsu, Chien-Yeh",JMIR Med Inform,349,16

Drug repurposing is currently one of the most tangible options for rapidly developing drugs for emerging and reemerging viruses. In general, drug repurposing starts with virtual screening of approved drugs employing various computational methods. However, the actual hit rate of virtual screening is very low, and most of the predicted compounds are false positives. Here, we developed a strategy for virtual screening with much reduced false positives through incorporating predocking filtering based on shape similarity and postdocking filtering based on interaction similarity. We applied this advanced virtual screening approach to repurpose 6,218 approved and clinical trial drugs for COVID-19. All 6,218 compounds were screened against main protease and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase of SARS-CoV-2, resulting in 15 and 23 potential repurposed drugs, respectively. Among them, seven compounds can inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication in Vero cells. Three of these drugs, emodin, omipalisib, and tipifarnib, show anti-SARS-CoV-2 activities in human lung cells, Calu-3. Notably, the activity of omipalisib is 200-fold higher than that of remdesivir in Calu-3. Furthermore, three drug combinations, omipalisib/remdesivir, tipifarnib/omipalisib, and tipifarnib/remdesivir, show strong synergistic effects in inhibiting SARS-CoV-2. Such drug combination therapy improves antiviral efficacy in SARS-CoV-2 infection and reduces the risk of each drug’s toxicity. The drug repurposing strategy reported here will be useful for rapidly developing drugs for treating COVID-19 and other viruses.","Jang, Woo Dae; Jeon, Sangeun; Kim, Seungtaek; Lee, Sang Yup",Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,349,20

This paper also analyzed the migration levels and diffusivity of the outer and inner cities of the GBA. Lastly, four evaluation indexes were selected to research the possibility of work resumption and the rating of epidemic prevention and control through kernel density estimation. According to the study, the amount of migration depends on the geographical proximity, relationship and economic development of the source region, and the severity of the epidemic depends mainly on the migration volume and the severity of the epidemic in the source region. The epidemic risk is related not only to the severity of the epidemic in the source region but also to the degree of urban traffic development and the degree of urban openness. After the resumption of work, the pressure of epidemic prevention and control has been concentrated mainly in Shenzhen and Canton; the further away a region is from the core cities, the lower the pressure in that region. The mass migration of the population makes it difficult to control the epidemic effectively. The study of the relationship between migration volume, epidemic severity and epidemic risk is helpful to further analyze transmission types and predict the trends of the epidemic.","Wang, Fangxiong; Tan, Ziqian; Yu, Zaihui; Yao, Siqi; Guo, Changfeng",PLoS One,349,16

This trend is puzzling because New Zealand confronted distressing health and economic uncertainties resembling those in other countries. Additionally, New Zealand's March/April 2020 COVID-19 lockdown was among the world's most stringent, requiring strict social isolation with domestic cohabitants for an unspecified period of time and with unknown effectiveness. Here, we use Bayesian multilevel mediation models to systematically test previously theorised mechanisms of health, economic, political, and social concern on pandemic distress in a nationally diverse panel sample during the first 18 days of New Zealand's lockdown against within-participant baselines from the previous year (N = 940). We observe that health concerns were not markedly elevated and that the maintenance of health satisfaction buffered people from greater distress. There was more variation in economic concern; however, sustained satisfaction with standards of living and future security prevented greater distress. Although satisfaction with the government and institutional trust rose precipitously, these gains did not diminish distress. However, distress mitigation occurred from a greater sense of neighbourhood community. Surprisingly, reduced fatigue, a byproduct of the stringent lockdown, proved to be an even more powerful distress buffer; the magnitude of this buffering suggests that fatigue reduction is an important horizon for public mental health research. Finally, most of the distress that New Zealanders experienced can be explained by challenges to personal relationship satisfaction. Overall, these results clarify how mental health was sustained and challenged during a stringent pandemic lockdown across a demographically diverse population, with insights for the present and future pandemics.","Bulbulia, J.

Recent evidence confirms that these chronic diseases increase the severity of COVID-19 infection and mortality risk. Conversely, denser transit supportive environments may increase risk of exposure to COVID-19 suggesting the potential for contrasting chronic versus infectious disease impacts of community design. A handful of recent studies have examined links between density and COVID-19 mortality rates reporting conflicting results. Population density has been used as a surrogate of urban form to capture the degree of walkability and public transit versus private vehicle travel demand. The current study employs a broader range of built environment features (density, design, and destination accessibility) and assesses how chronic disease mediates the relationship between built and natural environment and COVID-19 mortality. Negative and significant relationships are observed between built and natural environment features and COVID-19 mortality when accounting for the mediating effect of chronic disease. Findings underscore the importance of chronic disease when assessing relationships between COVID-19 mortality and community design. Based on a rigorous simulation-assisted random parameter path analysis framework, we further find that the relationships between COVID-19 mortality, obesity, and key correlates exhibit significant heterogeneity. Ignoring this heterogeneity in highly aggregate spatial data can lead to incorrect conclusions with regards to the relationship between built environment and COVID-19 transmission. Results presented here suggest that creating walkable environments with greenspace is associated with reduced risk of chronic disease and/or COVID-19 infection and mortality.","Frank, Lawrence D.; Wali, Behram",Sustain Cities Soc,349,10

She was successfully treated with coronary revascularization and stent placement, and remains on the ventilator to date as she quickly developed acute respiratory distress syndrome. We need more research in Covid-19 patients with cardiovascular involvement for early diagnosis, prevention of exposure to health care workers and effective treatment.","Siddamreddy, Suman; Thotakura, Ramakrishna; Dandu, Vasuki; Kanuru, Sruthi; Meegada, Sreenath",Cureus,349,3

This resulted in unprecedented reductions in anthropogenic activity, and reduced emissions of certain air pollutants, namely oxides of nitrogen. The UK ‘lockdown’ was enforced on 23/03/2020, which led to restrictions on movement, social interaction, and ‘non-essential’ businesses and services. This study employed an ensemble of measurement and modelling techniques to investigate changes in air quality, atmospheric composition and boundary layer reactivity in the South East of the UK post-lockdown. The techniques employed included in-situ gas- and particle-phase monitoring within central and local authority air quality monitoring networks, remote sensing by long path Differential Optical Absorption Spectroscopy and Sentinel-5P's TROPOMI, and detailed 0-D chemical box modelling. Findings showed that de-trended NO(2) concentrations decreased by an average of 14–38% when compared to the mean of the same period over the preceding 5-years. We found that de-trended particulate matter concentrations had been influenced by interregional pollution episodes, and de-trended ozone concentrations had increased across most sites, by up to 15%, such that total O(x) levels were roughly preserved. 0-D chemical box model simulations showed the observed increases in ozone concentrations during lockdown under the hydrocarbon-limited ozone production regime, where total NO(x) decreased proportionally greater than total non-methane hydrocarbons, which led to an increase in total hydroxyl, peroxy and organic peroxy radicals. These findings suggest a more complex scenario in terms of changes in air quality owing to the COVID-19 lockdown than originally reported and provide a window into the future to illustrate potential outcomes of policy interventions seeking large-scale NO(x) emissions reductions without due consideration of other reactive trace species.","Wyche, K.P.; Nichols, M.; Parfitt, H.; Beckett, P.; Gregg, D.J.; Smallbone, K.L.; Monks, P.S.",Sci Total Environ,349,26

As a result, there is a critical need for rapid and continuously updated access to the latest molecular data in a format in which all data can be quickly cross-referenced and compared. We adapted our genome browser visualization tool to the viral genome for this purpose. Molecular data, curated from published studies or from database submissions, are mapped to the viral genome and grouped together into “annotation tracks” where they can be visualized along the linear map of the viral genome sequence and programmatically downloaded in standard format for analysis. Results The UCSC Genome Browser for SARS-CoV-2 (https://genome.ucsc.edu/covid19.html) provides continuously updated access to the mutations in the many thousands of SARS-CoV-2 genomes deposited in GISAID and the international nucleotide sequencing databases, displayed alongside phylogenetic trees. These data are augmented with alignments of bat, pangolin, and other animal and human coronavirus genomes, including per-base evolutionary rate analysis. All available annotations are cross-referenced on the virus genome, including those from major databases (PDB, RFAM, IEDB, UniProt) as well as up-to-date individual results from preprints. Annotated data include predicted and validated immune epitopes, promising antibodies, RT-PCR and sequencing primers, CRISPR guides (from research, diagnostics, vaccines, and therapies), and points of interaction between human and viral genes. As a community resource, any user can add manual annotations which are quality checked and shared publicly on the browser the next day. Conclusions We invite all investigators to contribute additional data and annotations to this resource to accelerate research and development activities globally. Contact us at genome-www@soe.ucsc.edu with data suggestions or requests for support for adding data. Rapid sharing of data will accelerate SARS-CoV-2 research, especially when researchers take time to integrate their data with those from other labs on a widely-used community browser platform with standardized machine-readable data formats, such as the SARS-CoV-2 Genome Browser.","Fernandes, Jason D.; Hinrichs, Angie S.; Clawson, Hiram; Navarro Gonzalez, Jairo; Lee, Brian T.; Nassar, Luis R.; Raney, Brian J.; Rosenbloom, Kate R.; Nerli, Santrupti; Rao, Arjun; Schmelter, Daniel; Zweig, Ann S.; Lowe, Todd M.; Ares, Manuel; Corbet-Detig, Russ; Kent, W.

Here, we report that lipid rafts in Vero E6 cells are involved in the entry of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV). Infectivity assay showed the integrity of lipid rafts was required for productive infection of pseudotyped SARS-CoV. Depletion of plasma membrane cholesterol with MβCD relocalized raft-resident marker caveolin-1 as well as SARS-CoV receptor ACE2 to a nonraft environment, but did not significantly change the surface expression of ACE2. MβCD-treatment inhibited infectivity of pseudotyped SARS-CoV by 90%. Biochemical fractionation and confocal imaging confirmed that ACE2 colocalized with raft-resident markers. Furthermore, an ectodomain of SARS-CoV S protein (S1188HA) could associate with lipid rafts after binding to its receptor, and colocalize with raft-resident marker ganglioside GM1. The binding of S1188HA was not affected by depleting plasma membrane cholesterol.

BTK inhibition was shown to protect against lethal influenza-induced acute lung injury in mice. Inhibiting BTK has been hypothesized to ameliorate lung injury in patients with severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). ObjectiveTo evaluate the use of BTK inhibitors (BTKinibs) during COVID-19 and assess how they may affect patient outcomes.Evidence ReviewWe searched PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science: Core on December 30, 2020. Clinical studies with at least 5 COVID-19 patients treated with BTKinibs were included. Case reports and reviews were excluded.FindingsOne hundred twenty-five articles were identified, 6 of which met inclusion criteria. Sample size ranged from 6 to 126 patients. Patient populations included subjects hospitalized with COVID-19 (6/6) and admitted to the intensive care unit (5/6). Patient age ranged between 35 and 98 years. Four studies included patients already receiving BTKinibs for their lymphoproliferative disease, 1 for Waldenstrom’s macroglobulinemia and 3 for chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). The most common clinical outcomes measured were oxygen requirements (4/6) and hospitalization rate or duration (3/6). Differences in standard-of-care reflected the date of study and pre-existing conditions in the various patient cohorts. Full-dose acalabrutinib was evaluated in 2 studies, one study evaluated full-dose ibrutinib, and another study evaluated both ibrutinib and acalabrutinib. The remainder 2 studies described outcomes in CLL patients on multiple BTKinibs and other CLL-targeted treatments. Three studies showed decreased oxygen requirements in patients who started or continued BTKinibs. All three studies that evaluated hospitalization rate or duration found favorable outcomes in those on BTKinibs. Conclusions and Relevance﻿BTKinib use was associated with decreased oxygen requirements and decreased hospitalization rates and duration. However, randomized clinical trials are needed to validate the beneficial effects of BTKinibs for acute SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Stack, Michael; Sacco, Keith; Castagnoli, Riccardo; Livinski, Alicia A.; Notarangelo, Luigi D.; Lionakis, Michail S.",Res Sq,349,26

This report is of a 34-year-old woman from Brazil with a recent diagnosis of pulmonary lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM) diagnosed by raised serum VEGF-D levels and the finding of lung cysts on computed tomography (CT) imaging, who presented with COVID-19 pneumonia. CASE REPORT: Five months after the diagnosis of pulmonary LAM, which was based on the presence of diffuse and bilateral cystic lesions on CT scan associated with high serum VEGF-D levels, the patient presented with worsening dyspnea, drop in peripheral oxygen oxygenation, fever, and diffuse myalgia. She was using Sirolimus because it inhibits the development of LAM cells. A worsening of lung abnormalities was demonstrated in a chest CT examination, with the appearance of areas of consolidation and ground-glass abnormalities. A nasal swab sample tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection using reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction. Thus, Sirolimus was suspended because of concern about its immunosuppressive action. She received hospital support following the institutional protocol in force at the time, without the need for invasive mechanical ventilation. After 2 weeks, she was discharged from the hospital, with supplemental oxygen at home and return of Sirolimus. CONCLUSIONS: This report has described the presentation of COVID-19 pneumonia due to SARS-CoV-2 infection in a 34-year-old woman with a recent diagnosis of LAM involving the lungs.","Carneiro, Alícia Sales; Mafort, Thiago Thomaz; Lopes, Agnaldo José",Am J Case Rep,349,1

Healthcare personnel are particularly exposed during otologic surgery given the continuity with the nasopharynx, where the viral load is high, and the use of high-speed instruments. The purpose of the present study is to test a model of droplet dispersion produced in the performance of a drilling procedure on human bone to provide information about its distribution and size of the deposit in similar conditions to those of an operating theatre, to design different preventive measures. MATERIAL AND METHOD: A mastoidectomy and trans-labyrinthine approach were performed on an embalmed human corpse using for irrigation during drilling methylene blue dye in physiological saline solution (pss) at a concentration of 0.324 mg/mL. The distribution of the drops was stablished using semi-absorbent papers of size 52 cm × 42 cm covering the area around the dissection field to a radius of 150 cm and on the corpse at different heights to check vertical dispersion. The collected deposit material was analysed with the microscope at different magnification objectives. RESULTS: Droplets between 2 μm and 2.6 cm were obtained. The visualization of the coloured droplets in the horizontal plane at a magnification of 1.5 was detected at 150 cm from the focus of emission of milling particles. DISCUSSION: According to our study, bone drilling with high speed motors under continuous saline irrigation in a haemorrhagic surgical field increases the amount of aerosols exposing healthcare personnel to additional airbone particles. This risk does not end in the operating rooms as particles smaller than 2 μm can be suspended in the air for hours and could exit the operating theatre due to the use of positive pressure systems. Thus, the use of N95, FFP2, FFP3 or PAPRS should be considered and the development of hood systems to prevent the dispersion of aerosols during these procedures should be considered.","Gomez Serrano, Manuel; Santiago-Saez, Andres; Moreno Rodriguez, Rosa; Lopez Salcedo, Andrea; Poch Perez-Botija, Adriana; Aragones Sanzen-Baker, William; García Martín, Angel F.; García García, Juan Antonio; Iglesias Moreno, Maria Cruz",Eur Arch Otorhinolaryngol,349,31

Intriguingly, several developed countries with a higher quality of life have relatively higher mortality with COVID-19, compared to the middle- or low-income countries. Moreover, certain ethnic groups have shown a higher predilection to contract COVID-19, with heightened mortality. We sought to review the available literature with regards to impact of COVID-19 and comorbidities on the health and economics, especially in context to the developing countries including India. METHODS: A Boolean search was carried out in PubMed, MedRxiv and Google Scholar databases up till August 23, 2020 using the specific keywords to find the prevalence of comorbidities and its outcome in patients with COVID-19. RESULTS: All available evidence consistently suggests that presence of comorbidities is associated with a poor outcome in patients with COVID-19. Diabetes prevalence is highest in Indian COVID-19 patients compared to other countries. Majority of the patients with COVID-19 are asymptomatic ranging from 26 to 76%. CONCLUSIONS: Universal masking is the need of hour during unlock period. Low-income countries such as India, Brazil and Africa with less resources and an average socio-economic background, must adopt a strict policy for an affordable testing programs to trace, test, identify and home quarantine of asymptomatic cases.

Older adults are most susceptible to worse outcomes. The public health impact of the disease in terms of morbidity and mortality has necessitated the evolution of management protocols for effective care of older persons. This review describes our experience during this period attending to the healthcare needs of both the acutely ill and clinically stable patients at the first purpose-built facility for the care of older persons in Nigeria, the Chief Tony Anenih Geriatric Centre (CTAGC), University College Hospital, Ibadan. A major strategy recommended by the World Health Organization was a lockdown with restricted movements and laid down rules for engagement. As such, the CTAGC also embarked on steps to ensure patient safety as well as effective care. Prior to the lockdown, targeted activities included fumigation of the centre as well as health education and promotional activities. Measures were put in place to care for up to 95% of our patients at home. Thus, a “Care in Place” approach was adopted to enable them to take ownership of their care. Ambulatory older patients were seen on an out-patient basis following scheduled appointments after a telephone consultation through the hospital’s designated lines. Clients were managed for their routine health conditions which were mostly non-communicable diseases (NCDs). Also, acutely ill older patients were admitted for acute exacerbation and/or complications of their chronic morbidities. Importantly, 60% of admitted patients presented with COVID like symptoms but they all tested negative for COVID 19. Based on our experience at the CTAGC, older persons can be successfully managed through a “Care in place” approach in a resource-poor setting during pandemics with high infectivity rates such as COVID 19.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the feasibility of using noninvasive, wrist-worn wearable biometric monitoring sensors to detect presymptomatic viral infection after exposure and predict infection severity in patients exposed to H1N1 influenza or human rhinovirus. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: The cohort H1N1 viral challenge study was conducted during 2018; data were collected from September 11, 2017, to May 4, 2018. The cohort rhinovirus challenge study was conducted during 2015; data were collected from September 14 to 21, 2015. A total of 39 adult participants were recruited for the H1N1 challenge study, and 24 adult participants were recruited for the rhinovirus challenge study. Exclusion criteria for both challenges included chronic respiratory illness and high levels of serum antibodies. Participants in the H1N1 challenge study were isolated in a clinic for a minimum of 8 days after inoculation. The rhinovirus challenge took place on a college campus, and participants were not isolated. EXPOSURES: Participants in the H1N1 challenge study were inoculated via intranasal drops of diluted influenza A/California/03/09 (H1N1) virus with a mean count of 10(6) using the median tissue culture infectious dose (TCID50) assay. Participants in the rhinovirus challenge study were inoculated via intranasal drops of diluted human rhinovirus strain type 16 with a count of 100 using the TCID50 assay. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome measures included cross-validated performance metrics of random forest models to screen for presymptomatic infection and predict infection severity, including accuracy, precision, sensitivity, specificity, F1 score, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). RESULTS: A total of 31 participants with H1N1 (24 men [77.4%]; mean [SD] age, 34.7 [12.3] years) and 18 participants with rhinovirus (11 men [61.1%]; mean [SD] age, 21.7 [3.1] years) were included in the analysis after data preprocessing. Separate H1N1 and rhinovirus detection models, using only data on wearble devices as input, were able to distinguish between infection and noninfection with accuracies of up to 92% for H1N1 (90% precision, 90% sensitivity, 93% specificity, and 90% F1 score, 0.85 [95% CI, 0.70-1.00] AUC) and 88% for rhinovirus (100% precision, 78% sensitivity, 100% specificity, 88% F1 score, and 0.96 [95% CI, 0.85-1.00] AUC). The infection severity prediction model was able to distinguish between mild and moderate infection 24 hours prior to symptom onset with an accuracy of 90% for H1N1 (88% precision, 88% sensitivity, 92% specificity, 88% F1 score, and 0.88 [95% CI, 0.72-1.00] AUC) and 89% for rhinovirus (100% precision, 75% sensitivity, 100% specificity, 86% F1 score, and 0.95 [95% CI, 0.79-1.00] AUC). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This cohort study suggests that the use of a noninvasive, wrist-worn wearable device to predict an individual’s response to viral exposure prior to symptoms is feasible.

The Serbian national survey—CoV2Soul.RS—was launched to document the MH status of the Serbian population following the COVID-19 pandemic and to contribute to an international evidence base about MH prevalence rates during different phases of the pandemic. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This cross-sectional study was designed to collect a nationally representative sample (N=1200; age 18–65 years; estimated start/end—June/November 2021) using multistage probabilistic household sampling. Trained staff will conduct in-person diagnostic interviews. A battery of self-report instruments will be administered to assess the quality of life (QoL), general distress and associated protective and harmful psychological and societal factors. Analyses will be conducted to delineate the prevalence rates of MH disorders, how MH conditions and QoL vary with respect to sociodemographic variables, personality, health status and traumatic events during the COVID-19 pandemic, and to test how these relations depend on geographical region. Moreover, this study was designed to explore mechanisms linking personality and the perception of pandemic consequences and associated distress. Prevalence rates of MH disorders will be calculated using descriptive statistics. For additional analyses, we will use correlations, analysis of variance and regression analyses. The hierarchical structure of the data will be explored using multilevel random coefficient modelling. Structural equation modelling will be used to investigate the indirect effects of personality on distress through relevant variables.

Health literacy is regarded as a potential tool to reduce health inequalities and improve migrant's access to and quality of health care. Yet, little is known about the health literacy needs among these groups and how to address them. This paper outlines the protocol for a migrant community-based co-design project that seeks to optimize health literacy, health promotion, and social cohesion in support of prevention of NCDs among migrants in Lisbon using the OPtismizing HEalth LIteracy and Access (Ophelia) process. This participatory implementation research project starts with a mixed-methods needs assessment covering health literacy strengths, weaknesses and needs of migrants, and local data about determinants of health behaviors, service engagement, and organizational responsiveness. Diverse migrant groups will be engaged and surveyed using the Health Literacy Questionnaire and questions on sociodemographic and economic characteristics, health status, use of health services, and perceived impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Semi-structured interviews with migrants will also be conducted. Based on data collected, vignettes will be developed representing typical persons with diverse health literacy profiles. Migrants and stakeholders will participate in ideas generation workshops for depth co-creation discussions in simulated real-world situations based on the vignettes, to design health literacy-based multisectoral interventions. Selected interventions will be piloted through quality improvement cycles to ensure ongoing local refinements and ownership development. Through a genuine engagement, the project will evaluate the uptake, effectiveness and sustainability of the interventions. This protocol takes a grounded approach to produce evidence on real health literacy needs from the perspective of key stakeholders, especially migrants, and embodies strong potential for effective knowledge translation into innovative, locally relevant, culturally and context congruent solutions for prevention of NCDs among migrants. Given the diverse communities engaged, this protocol will likely be adaptable to other migrant groups in a wide range of contexts, particularly in European countries. The scale-up of interventions to similar contexts and populations will provide much needed evidence on how health literacy interventions can be developed and applied to reduce health inequality and improve health in diverse communities.","Dias, Sónia; Gama, Ana; Maia, Ana Catarina; Marques, Maria J.; Campos Fernandes, Adalberto; Goes, Ana Rita; Loureiro, Isabel; Osborne, Richard H.",Front Public Health,349,21

In response to the outbreaks, maternal pertussis vaccination programmes in pregnant women have been adopted worldwide, including the USA in 2011 and the UK in 2012. Following the success of the programme in England, we evaluated the health and economic impact of stopping versus continuing the maternal pertussis immunisation to inform public health policy making. METHODS: We used a mathematical model to estimate the number of infant hospitalisations and deaths related to pertussis in England over 2019-2038. Losses in quality-adjusted life years, QALYs, were considered for infants (aged 0-2 months) who survived or died from pertussis, bereaved parents (of infants who died from pertussis), and women with pertussis (aged 20-44 years). Direct medical costs to the National Health Service included infant hospitalisations, maternal vaccinations, and disease in women. Costs and QALYs were discounted at 3.5%. Changes in the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio, ICER, were explored in sensitivity analyses. RESULTS: The model supports continuing the maternal pertussis immunisation programme as a cost-effective intervention at an ICER of £14,500/QALY (2.5% and 97.5%-quantile: £7,300/QALY to £32,400/QALY). Stopping versus continuing the maternal programme results in an estimated mean of 972 (range 582 to 1489) versus 308 (184 to 471) infant hospitalisations annually. Results were most sensitive to the number of hospitalisations and deaths when stopping the maternal programme. At a cost-effectiveness threshold of £30,000/QALY, the probability of the maternal programme being cost-effective was 96.2%. CONCLUSION: Our findings support continuing the maternal pertussis vaccination programme as otherwise higher levels of disease activity and infant mortality are expected to return. These results have led policy makers to decide to continue the maternal programme in the UK routine immunisation schedule.","Sandmann, Frank; Jit, Mark; Andrews, Nick; Buckley, Hannah L; Campbell, Helen; Ribeiro, Sonia; Sile, Bersabeh; Stowe, Julia; Tessier, Elise; Ramsay, Mary; Amirthalingam, Gayatri; Choi, Yoon H",Vaccine,349,6

Plenty of studies have focused on different materials and types of fibers in combination with the concrete matrix. Experimental tests show that fiber dosage improves the energy absorption capacity of concrete and enhances the robustness of concrete elements. Fiber reinforced concrete has also been illustrated to be a material for developing infrastructure sustainability in RC elements like façade plates, columns, beams, or walls. Due to increasing costs of the produced fiber reinforced concrete and to ensure the serviceability limit state of construction elements, there is a demand to analyze the necessary fiber dosage in the concrete composition. It is expected that the surface and length of used fiber in combination with their dosage influence the structure of fresh and hardened concrete. This work presents an investigation of the mechanical parameters of HPFRC with different polymer fiber dosage. Tests were carried out on a mixture with polypropylene and polyvinyl alcohol fiber with dosages of 15, 25, and 35 kg/m(3) as well as with control concrete without fiber. Differences were observed in the compressive strength and in the modulus of elasticity as well as in the flexural and splitting tensile strength. The flexural tensile strength test was conducted on two different element shapes: square panel and beam samples. These mechanical properties could lead to recommendations for designers of façade elements made of HPFRC.","Grzesiak, Szymon; Pahn, Matthias; Schultz-Cornelius, Milan; Harenberg, Stefan; Hahn, Christoph",Materials (Basel),349,3

Patients with diabetes are more vulnerable to the disease, and the mortality is higher than in those without diabetes. We reported a severe COVID-19 patient with diabetes and shared our experience with blood glucose management. PATIENT CONCERNS: A 64-year-old female diabetes patient was admitted to the intensive care unit due to productive coughing for 8 days without any obvious cause. The results of blood gas analysis indicated that the partial pressure of oxygen was 84 mm Hg with oxygen 8 L/min, and the oxygenation index was less than 200 mm Hg. In addition, postprandial blood glucose levels were abnormal (29.9 mmol/L). DIAGNOSES: The patient was diagnosed with COVID-19 (severe type) and type 2 diabetes. INTERVENTIONS: Comprehensive interventions including establishing a multidisciplinary team, closely monitoring her blood glucose level, an individualized diabetes diet, early activities, psychological care, etc, were performed to control blood glucose while actively treating COVID-19 infection. OUTCOMES: After the comprehensive measures, the patient's blood glucose level gradually became stable, and the patient was discharged after 20 days of hospitalization. LESSONS: This case indicated that the comprehensive measures performed by a multidisciplinary team achieved good treatment effects on a COVID-19 patient with diabetes. Targeted treatment and nursing methods should be performed based on patients’ actual situations in clinical practice.","Hu, Rujun; Gao, Huiming; Huang, Di; Jiang, Deyu; Chen, Fang; Fu, Bao; Yuan, Xiaoli; Li, Jin; Jiang, Zhixia",Medicine (Baltimore),349,0

We think it could be useful in differentiating coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) stages, which could in terms of helping improve our therapeutic interventions. Methods The medical records of adult patients admitted to the hospital with probable COVID-19 were extracted and analyzed. We excluded patients with no serology and no clear outcome at the end of data collection. Patient demographics, medical history, and biochemical and clinical data were retrieved. Results A total of 202 patients were included; 57% were males, the majority were Hispanic (45%), followed by African Americans (22%). Hypertension is the most common comorbidity, followed by diabetes mellitus and chronic kidney disease. We classified them into three groups based on their serology: subacute stage (47 patients) with both immunoglobulin M (IgM) and IgG negative; acute stage (116 patients) with IgM positive and late-stage (39 patients) with IgM negative and IgG positive. We found that elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and ferritin were present in the IgM+ and IgM-/IgG+ subgroups (p-value of 0.0061 and p-value 0.0013, respectively) while C-reactive protein (CRP) and D-dimer were more elevated in the IgM-/IgG- and IgM+ subgroups (P <0.0001 and p-value of 0.0452, respectively). The IgM+ group had the worst prognosis, with high mortality despite receiving remdesivir and dexamethasone. Conclusion Our findings suggest that the use of serology in patients hospitalized with COVID-19 could predict prognosis; this will need to be validated in a larger prospective study.","Mutyala, Monica; Ali, Ruhma; Chan, Kok Hoe; Patel, Aditya; Kiwan, Chrystina; Ekmekjian, Zareh; Koneru, Kalyan; Reddy, Dhinesh V; Miller, Richard; Szabela, Maria; Slim, Jihad",Cureus,349,1

METHOD: A pre-post study was conducted using Bowen’s Framework to describe key domains of feasibility: demand (referrals), acceptability (uptake, attendance, satisfaction), implementation (resources), practicality (adverse events, costs) and limited-efficacy (function, quality of life, self-efficacy). Participants were medically stable, adult cancer survivors receiving curative or palliative treatment for cancer at the health service. Participants completed an 8-week home or hospital-based exercise program. Data were analysed descriptively. Standardised mean differences (Hedge’s g) and mean differences were calculated to determine effect size and clinical significance. RESULTS: The exercise-based rehabilitation service received 155 referrals over 6 months. Of those eligible, 73/119 (61%) commenced. Participants opting for twice-weekly, hospital-based exercise attended 9/16 (56%) sessions. Participants reported high satisfaction and there were no major adverse events. The program utilised existing resources, with the predominant cost being staff. The average health service cost per participant was AUD $1,104. Participants made clinically significant gains in function (6-min walk distance; + 73 m, 95% confidence interval 49 to 96) and quality of life (EORTC QLQ-C30 Global quality of life; + 8 units, 95% confidence interval 3 to 13). CONCLUSION: Implementation of exercise-based rehabilitation in a co-located cancer unit was safe and feasible.

This issue has been recently exemplified by the large numbers of infection rates and deaths caused by covid-19 in BAME populations. Future research has the potential to improve health outcomes for these groups. High quality research priority setting is crucial to effectively consider the needs of the most vulnerable groups of the population. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this systematic review is to identify existing research priority studies conducted for BAME health and to determine the extent to which they followed good practice principles for research priority setting. METHOD: Included studies were identified by searching Medline, Cinnahl, PsychINFO, Psychology and Behavioral Sciences Collection, as well as searches in grey literature. Search terms included “research priority setting”, “research prioritisation”, “research agenda”, “Black and minority ethnic”, “ethnic group”. Studies were included if they identified or elicited research priorities for BAME health and if they outlined a process of conducting a research prioritisation exercise. A checklist of Nine Common Themes of Good Practice in research priority setting was used as a methodological framework to evaluate the research priority processes of each study. RESULTS: Out of 1514 citations initially obtained, 17 studies were included in the final synthesis. Topic areas for their research prioritisation exercise included suicide prevention, knee surgery, mental health, preterm birth, and child obesity. Public and patient involvement was included in eleven studies. Methods of research prioritisation included workshops, Delphi techniques, surveys, focus groups and interviews. The quality of empirical evidence was diverse. None of the exercises followed all good practice principles as outlined in the checklist. Areas that were lacking in particular were: the lack of a comprehensive approach to guide the process; limited use of criteria to guide discussion around priorities; unequal or no representation from ethnic minorities, and poor evaluation of their own processes. CONCLUSIONS: Research priority setting practices were found to mostly not follow good practice guidelines which aim to ensure rigour in priority setting activities and support the inclusion of BAME communities in establishing the research agenda. Research is unlikely to deliver useful findings that can support relevant research and positive change for BAME communities unless they fulfil areas of good practice such as inclusivity of key stakeholders’ input, planning for implementation of identified priorities, criteria for deciding on priorities, and evaluation of their processes in research priority setting.","Iqbal, Halima; West, Jane; Haith-Cooper, Melanie; McEachan, Rosemary R.

The survey collected data about changes in food purchases, respondents' mood during the lockdown, conspiracist beliefs, exposure to the virus, and planned food purchasing behavior after the lockdown. We used the data to construct measures of the psychological pressure exerted by the COVID-19 emergency on consumers. We use an endogenous selection regression model to assess the impact of psychological pressure on the decision of changing food purchased. The analysis identified two opposite approaches to change in food purchasing decisions: impulsive approach and reflective approach. The former is associated with a higher probability of changing food purchase but a lower probability to keep the changes in the long run than the latter. Our results suggest that COVID-19 psychological pressure was associated with impulsive approach to buy food. Consequently, food-purchasing behavior is expected to revert to pre-COVID 19 habits when the emergency is over.","Russo, Carlo; Simeone, Mariarosaria; Demartini, Eugenio; Marescotti, Maria Elena; Gaviglio, Anna",Heliyon,349,20

To quantify the antibody decay rates among the varying levels of anti-nucleocapsid (anti-N) Immunoglobulin G (IgG) in convalescent COVID-19 patients and estimate the length of time they maintained SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies, we have collected longitudinal blood samples from 943 patients over the course of seven months after their initial detection of SARS-CoV-2 virus by RT-PCR. Anti-N IgG levels were then quantified in these blood samples. The primary study outcome was the comparison of antibody decay rates from convalescent patients with high or low initial levels of antibodies using a mixed linear model. Additional measures include the length of time that patients maintain sustainable levels of anti-N IgG. Antibody quantification of blood samples donated by the same subject multiple times shows a gradual decrease of IgG levels to the cutoff index level of 1.4 signal/cut-off (S/C) on the Abbott Architect SARS-CoV-2 IgG test. In addition, this study shows that antibody reduction rate is dependent on initial IgG levels, and patients with initial IgG levels above 3 S/C show a significant 1.68-fold faster reduction rate compared to those with initial IgG levels below 3 S/C. For a majority of the donors naturally occurring anti-N antibodies were detected above the threshold for only four months after infection with SARS-CoV-2. This study is clinically important for the prediction of immune response capacity in COVID-19 patients.","Xia, Weiming; Li, Mingfei; Wang, Ying; Kazis, Lewis E.; Berlo, Kim; Melikechi, Noureddine; Chiklis, Gregory R.",Sci Rep,349,24

Though the substrate targets of the viral nucleotidyl transferase are unknown, NiRAN active sites are highly conserved and essential for viral replication 3. We show, for the first time, the detection and sequence location of GMP-modified amino acids in nidovirus RdRP-associated proteins using heavy isotope-assisted MS and MS/MS peptide sequencing. We identified lys-143 in the equine arteritis virus (EAV) protein, nsp7, as a primary site of nucleotidylation in vitro that uses a phosphoramide bond to covalently attach with GMP. In SARS-CoV-2 replicase proteins, we demonstrate a unique O-linked GMP attachment on nsp7 ser-1, whose formation required the presence of nsp12. It is clear that additional nucleotidylation sites remain undiscovered, which includes the possibility that nsp12 itself may form a transient GMP adduct in the NiRAN active site that has eluted detection in these initial studies due to instability of the covalent attachment. Our results demonstrate new strategies for detecting GMP-peptide linkages that can be adapted for higher throughput screening using mass spectrometric technologies.

METHODS: The concordance between the cobas 8800 SARS-CoV-2 and a laboratory developed (LD) reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay was assessed on 377 combined nasopharyngeal/oropharyngeal swabs in Hanks medium. RESULTS: The positive and negative agreement between these assays were 99.3 % (95 % CI, 97.3–99.9) and 77.1 % (95 % CI, 67.7–84.4), respectively, for an overall agreement of 93.6 % (95 % CI, 90.7–95.7) beyond random chance (kappa of 0.82, 95 % CI, 0.75−0.85). Of the 22 samples positive by cobas SARS-CoV-2 only, 9 were positive only for ORF-1 gene and had Cycle thresholds (Ct) > 35.1, 8 were positive only for the E gene with Ct > 35.5 and 5 were positive for both targets with Ct > 33.9. Samples positive only with the cobas assay were more often positive with only one gene target (77.3 %) than samples positive in both assays (16.9 %, p < 0.0001). Ct values in the cobas SARS-CoV-2 assay were significantly higher in the 279 samples testing positive in both assays (32.9 %, 95 % CI 32.3–33.6) compared to the 22 samples with discordant results (36.6 %, 95 % CI 36.2–37.1; p = 0.0009). An excellent correlation (r(2) = 0.98) was obtained between Ct values of the ORF-1 and E targets in the cobas assays and a good correlation was obtained between LD RT-PCR test and cobas SARS CoV-2 ORF-1 target (r(2) = 0.82). CONCLUSION: Our study demonstrated an excellent concordance between a LD RT-PCR and the cobas SARS-CoV-2 tests on the 8800 platform.","Boutin, Catherine-Audrey; Grandjean-Lapierre, Simon; Gagnon, Simon; Labbé, Annie-Claude; Charest, Hugues; Roger, Michel; Coutlée, François",J Clin Virol,349,1

The activation pathways remain to be fully elucidated. We investigated the ability of circulating to induce dysregulated immune responses. Materials & Methods: Calprotectin and high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) were associated with ARDS in 60 COVID-19 patients. In a second cohort of 40 COVID-19 patients calprotectin at hospital admission was associated with serum levels of soluble urokinase plasminogen activator receptor (suPAR). A COVID-19 animal model was developed by intravenous injection of plasma from healthy volunteers or patients with COVID-19 ARDS into C57/BL6 mice once daily for 3 consecutive days. In separate experiments, mice were treated with a) the IL-1 receptor antagonist Anakinra or vehicle and b) Flo1-2a anti-murine anti-IL-1 monoclonal antibody or the specific anti-human IL-1 antibody XB2001, or isotype controls. Mice were sacrificed on day 4. Cytokines and myeloperoxidase (MPO) in tissues were measured. Results: Calprotectin, but not HMGB1, was elevated ARDS. Higher suPAR readouts indicated higher calprotectin levels. CHallenge of mice with COVID-19 plasma led to inflammatory reactions in murine lung and intestines as evidenced by increased levels of TNF, IL-6, IFN{gamma} and MPO. Anakinra treatment brought these levels down. Similar decrease was found in mice treated with Flo1-2a but not with XB2001. Conclusion: Circulating alarmins, specifically calprotectin, of critically ill COVID-19 patients induces tissue-specific inflammatory responses through an IL-1 mediated mechanism. This could be attenuated through inhibition of IL-1 receptor or specific inhibition of IL-1.","Renieris, G.; Karakike, E.; Xu, Z.; Gkavogianni, T.; Droggiti, D.- E.; Schubert, K.; Kafousopoulos, D.; Hermann, M.; Netea, M.

Due to the importance of the inflammatory pathways in the pathogenesis of COVID-19 patients, evaluating the effects of anti-inflammatory medications is important. Glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonist (GLP-1 RA) is awell-known glucose-lowering agent with anti-inflammatory effects. AREAS COVERED: Resources were extracted from the PubMed database, using keywords such as glucagon-like peptide-1, GLP-1 RA, SARS-CoV-2, COVID-19, inflammation, in April2021. In this review, the effects of GLP-1RA in reducing inflammation and modifying risk factors of COVID-19 severe complications are discussed. However, GLP-1 is degraded by DPP-4 with aplasma half-life of about 2–5 minutes, which makes it difficult to measure GLP-1 plasma level in clinical settings.

In many cases the common cold results in severe illness due to complications, such as fever or pneumonia. Children, old people, and immunosuppressed patients are at the highest risk and require fast diagnosis and therapeutic intervention. However, the availability and efficiencies of existing therapeutic approaches vary depending on the virus. Investigation of the pathologies that are associated with infection by respiratory viruses will be paramount for diagnosis, treatment modalities, and the development of new therapies. Changes in redox homeostasis in infected cells are one of the key events that is linked to infection with respiratory viruses and linked to inflammation and subsequent tissue damage.

Camp in a Box was a 9-week program, inclusive of a 1-week intensive camp component followed by an 8-week booster component with content focused on nutrition, mental health and physical activity education. The Camp in a Box is a Tribal/Urban Indian-University partnership, and materials were developed to replace an existing weeklong residential camp and to comply with social distancing guidelines. Fourteen American Indian families from Tribal/Urban Indian communities in the southwestern United States participated (36 children aged 2–18 years; 32 adults). The intensive camp week included daily materials for families to complete together, Monday through Friday. Materials were provided for approximately 4 h of activities per day. The booster sessions began after camp week and included approximately 4 h of supplementary activities designed to be completed at any time most convenient for the family over the course of the week. Activities were designed to encourage interaction among family members with materials and supplies for parents and youth to participate. Self-reported outcomes suggested that families changed their eating habits to include more vegetables, less sweets and junk food. Parents reported an increase in family physical activity and that the activities brought the family closer together. Our Camp in a Box program was feasible and well-received until school began. During camp week, 100% of recruited families participated; at Booster Week 8, ten families (71%) remained enrolled and active. Camp in a Box is a feasible alternative to residential camps for promotion of health behaviors associated with metabolic disease prevention among American Indian families. In contrast to residential camps for youth, Camp in a Box offers an opportunity to engage the entire family in health promotion activities.","Gachupin, Francine C.; Caston, Elissa; Chavez, Christine; Bernal, Jacob; Cager, Phoebe; Harris, Drew; John, Tara; Remitera, Joe; Garcia, Charlotte A.; Romero, Victoria M.; Gchachu, Karina E.; Gchachu, Celeste R.; Garcia, Kutz; Gchachu, Vincent; Gchachu, Brenna M.; Rens, Evelyn; Slowtalker, Jacquanette; Blew, Robert; Tracy, Keyauni; Figueroa, Ty; Thomson, Cynthia A.; Ranjbar, Noshene; Hingle, Melanie; O’Connor, Teresia; Roe, Denise J.; Grant, Vernon; Swick, Shayna; Joe, Jennie R.",Front Sociol,349,28

Such interventions, alongside more traditional public health measures, interact with baseline health, health system, and social and economic vulnerabilities in LMICs to compound negative impacts. This analysis, based on a rapid evidence assessment by the Social Science in Humanitarian Action Platform in mid-2020, highlights the drivers and evidence of these impacts, emphasises the additional vulnerabilities experienced by marginalised social groups, and provides insight for governments, agencies, organisations and communities to implement more proportionate, appropriate, comprehensive and socially just responses that address COVID-19 in the context of and alongside other disease burdens. In the short term, there is an urgent need to monitor and mitigate impacts of pandemic responses on health service provision, access and use, including through embedding COVID-19 response within integrated health systems approaches. These efforts should also feed into longer-term strategies to strengthen health systems, expand universal healthcare coverage and attend to the social determinants of health—commitments, both existing and new—which governments, donors and international agencies must make and be held accountable to. Crucially, affected communities must be empowered to play a central role in identifying health priorities, allocating resources, and designing and delivering services.","Hrynick, Tabitha A; Ripoll Lorenzo, Santiago; Carter, Simone E",BMJ Glob Health,349,16

Although in the long-term mass vaccinations remains the most promising approach to control the pandemic, evidence suggests that new variants of the virus have emerged that may be able to evade the immune responses triggered by current vaccines. Therefore despite the recent approval of a number of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines there remains considerable urgency for effective treatments for COVID-19. Severe-to-critical COVID-19 has been shown to be associated with a dysregulated host immune response to SARS-CoV-2 with elevated levels of C-C chemokine receptor type 5 (CCR5) ligands including chemokine C-C ligands 3, 4, 5, as well as interleukins 6 and 10. Leronlimab, a CCR5-specific humanised IgG4 monoclonal antibody originally developed for the treatment of HIV has been studied for the treatment of COVID-19. In the TEMPEST trial which compared leronlimab to placebo in subjects with mild-to-moderate COVID-19, a post hoc analysis showed that leronlimab led to improvements from baseline in National Early Warning Score 2 (NEWS2) at Day 14 in the sub-set of people with more severe disease. Data has also been released on a further ongoing, randomized, placebo-controlled phase 3 registrational trial of leronlimab in 394 people with severe-to-critical COVID-19. The results show that Day 28 mortality was reduced (P=0.0319) in the subset of participants receiving leronlimab plus other pre-specified commonly used COVID-19 treatments including dexamethasone administered as part of their standard of care (SOC) compared to participants receiving placebo plus other pre-specified commonly used COVID-19 treatments including dexamethasone as part of their SOC. Several cases have recently been reported demonstrated that treatment with leronlimab restores immune function and achieves clinical improvement in people with critical COVID-19. Here we report on a further case of a critically ill person who was treated with leronlimab. This person had been on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) for an extended period of time before receiving 4 doses of leronlimab. The male subject received his first dose of leronlimab on Day 79 of hospitalization he was weaned off ECMO by Day 84 and discharged from the ECMO intensive care unit on Day 91.

However, these parameters have not been observed consistently across studies. The aim of this review was to assess clinical laboratory parameters which may serve as markers or predictors of severe or critical COVID-19. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We conducted a systematic search of MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science, CINAHL and Google Scholar databases from 2019 through April 18, 2020, and reviewed bibliographies of eligible studies, relevant systematic reviews, and the medRxiv pre-print server. We included hospital-based observational studies reporting clinical laboratory parameters of confirmed cases of COVID-19 and excluded studies having large proportions (>10%) of children and pregnant women. Two authors independently carried out screening of articles, data extraction and quality assessment. Meta-analyses were done using random effects model. Meta-median difference (MMD) and 95% confidence interval (CI) was calculated for each laboratory parameter. Forty-five studies in 6 countries were included. Compared to non-severe COVID-19 cases, severe or critical COVID-19 was characterised by higher neutrophil count (MMD: 1.23 [95% CI: 0.58 to 1.88] ×10(9) cells/L), and lower lymphocyte, CD4 and CD8 T cell counts with MMD (95% CI) of -0.39 (-0.47, -0.31) ×10(9) cells/L, -204.9 (-302.6, -107.1) cells/μl and -123.6 (-170.6, -76.6) cells/μl, respectively. Other notable results were observed for C-reactive protein (MMD: 36.97 [95% CI: 27.58, 46.35] mg/L), interleukin-6 (MMD: 17.37 [95% CI: 4.74, 30.00] pg/ml), Troponin I (MMD: 0.01 [0.00, 0.02] ng/ml), and D-dimer (MMD: 0.65 [0.45, 0.85] mg/ml). CONCLUSIONS: Relative to non-severe COVID-19, severe or critical COVID-19 is characterised by increased markers of innate immune response, decreased markers of adaptive immune response, and increased markers of tissue damage and major organ failure. These markers could be used to recognise severe or critical disease and to monitor clinical course of COVID-19.","Moutchia, Jude; Pokharel, Pratik; Kerri, Aldiona; McGaw, Kaodi; Uchai, Shreeshti; Nji, Miriam; Goodman, Michael",PLoS One,349,33

While it was initially considered primarily a respiratory illness, rapidly accumulating data suggests that COVID-19 results in a unique, profoundly prothrombotic milieu leading to both arterial and venous thrombosis. Consistently, elevated D-dimer level has emerged as an independent risk factor for poor outcomes, including death. Several other laboratory markers and blood counts have also been associated with poor prognosis, possibly due to their connection to thrombosis. At present, the pathophysiology underlying the hypercoagulable state is poorly understood. However, a growing body of data suggests that the initial events occur in the lung. A severe inflammatory response, originating in the alveoli, triggers a dysfunctional cascade of inflammatory thrombosis in the pulmonary vasculature, leading to a state of local coagulopathy. This is followed, in patients with more severe disease, by a generalized hypercoagulable state that results in macro- and microvascular thrombosis. Of concern, is the observation that anticoagulation may be inadequate in many circumstances, highlighting the need for alternative or additional therapies. Numerous ongoing studies investigating the pathophysiology of the COVID-19 associated coagulopathy may provide mechanistic insights that can direct appropriate interventional strategies.","Abou-Ismail, Mouhamed Yazan; Diamond, Akiva; Kapoor, Sargam; Arafah, Yasmin; Nayak, Lalitha",Thromb Res,349,16

This model takes into account all the death, infected and recovered characteristics of this disease. To determine the extent of the risk posed by this novel coronavirus; the transmission rate (R0) is utilized for a time period from the beginning of spreading virus. In particular, it includes a novel policy to capture the R0 response in the virus spreading over time. The model estimates the vulnerability of the pandemic with a prediction of new cases by estimating a time-varying R0 to capture changes in the behavior of SIR model implies to new policy taken at different times and different locations of the world. This modified SIR model with the different values of R0 can be applied to different country scenario using the real time data report provided by the authorities during this pandemic. The effective evaluation of R0 can forecast the necessity of lockdown as well as reopening the economy.","Anzum, R.; Islam, M. Z.",,349,20

Mice do not develop COVID-19 upon infection with SARS-CoV-2 due to the strict tropism of the virus to the human ACE2 receptor. The aim of the current study was the implementation of an adenovirus-mediated infection protocol for human ACE2 expression in HLA transgenic mice. Transient pulmonary expression of the human ACE2 receptor in these mice results in their sensitisation to SARS-CoV-2 infection, consequently providing a valuable animal model for COVID-19. Infection results in a transient loss in body weight starting 3 days post-infection, reaching 20–30% loss of weight at day 7 and full recovery at days 11–13 post-infection. The evolution of the disease revealed high reproducibility and very low variability among individual mice. The method was implemented in two different strains of HLA immunized mice. Infected animals developed strong protective humoral and cellular immune responses specific to the viral spike-protein, strictly depending on the adenovirus-mediated human ACE2 expression. Convalescent animals were protected against a subsequent re-infection with SARS-CoV-2, demonstrating that the model may be applied for assessment of efficacy of anti-viral immune responses.","Chitlaru, Theodor; Bar-Haim, Erez; Bar-On, Liat; Rotem, Shahar; Cohen, Hila; Elia, Uri; Gur, David; Aftalion, Moshe; Alkalay, Ron; Makdasi, Efi; Evgy, Yentl; Falach, Reut; Israeli, Ma’ayan; Bercovich-Kinori, Adi; Achdout, Hagit; Yahalom-Ronen, Yfat; Rosenfeld, Ronit; Cohen, Ofer",Pathogens,349,20

Respiratory decline in COVID-19 is mediated by a pneumonic aberrant immune cytokine storm. Low-dose radiation was used to treat pneumonia in the pre-antibiotic era. Radiation immunomodulatory effects may improve outcomes in COVID-19. Methods: We performed a single-institution phase I/II trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of single-fraction, low-dose, whole-lung radiation for COVID-19 pneumonia. Eligible patients were hospitalized, had radiographic pneumonic infiltrates, required supplemental oxygen, and were clinically deteriorating. Results: Of nine patients screened, five were treated with whole-lung radiation from April 23-28, 2020 and followed for 7 days. Median age was 90 (range 64-94); four were nursing home residents with multiple comorbidities. Within 24 hours of radiation, three patients (60%) weaned from supplemental oxygen to ambient air, four (80%) exhibited radiographic improvement, and median Glasgow coma score improved from 10 to 14. A fourth patient (80% overall recovery) weaned from oxygen at hour 96. Mean time to clinical recovery was 35 hours. There were no acute skin, pulmonary, GI, GU toxicities. Conclusions: In a pilot trial of five oxygen-dependent patients with COVID-19 pneumonia, low-dose whole-lung radiation led to rapid improvement in clinical status, encephalopathy, and radiographic infiltrates without acute toxicity. Low-dose whole-lung radiation is safe, shows early promise of efficacy, and warrants further study in larger prospective trials. NCT04366791","Hess, C. B.; Buchwald, Z. S.; Stokes, W.; Switchenko, J.

Although there is biological plausibility for its use, the evidence supporting its effectiveness is scarce, and the risks associated with it may be significant. Thus, based on a virtual case simulation, we estimated the risks of radiation-induced cancer (RIC) and cardiac disease. METHODS: Lifetime attributable risks (LAR) of RIC were calculated for the lung, liver, esophagus, and breast of female patients. The cardiovascular risk of exposure-induced death (REID) due to ischemic heart disease was also calculated. The doses received by the organs involved in the treatment were obtained from a simulation of conformal radiotherapy (RT) treatment, delivering a dose of 0.5 Gy–1.5 Gy to the lungs. We considered a LAR and REID <1% as acceptable, 1–2% cautionary, and >2% unacceptable. RESULTS: The lung was at the highest risk for RIC (absolute LAR below 5200 cases/100,000 and 2250 cases/100,000 for women and men, respectively). For women, the breast had the second-highest LAR, especially for young women. The liver and esophagus had LARs below 700/100,000 for both sexes, with a higher incidence of esophageal cancer in women and liver cancer in men. Regarding the LAR cutoff, we observed an unacceptable or cautionary LAR for lung cancer in all women and men <60 years with an RT dose >1 Gy. LAR for lung cancer with an RT dose of 1 Gy was cautionary for women >60 years of age and men <40 years of age. No LAR estimation was unacceptable for the RT dose ≤0.7 Gy in all groups irrespective of sex or age at exposure. Only 0.5 Gy had an acceptable REID. CONCLUSIONS: A RT dose ≤0.5 Gy provides an acceptable LAR estimate (≤1%) for RIC and REID, irrespective of sex and age. The current ongoing trials should initially use doses ≤0.5 Gy to maintain the risks at an acceptable level and include only patients who fail or do not have any other treatment option.","Arruda, Gustavo Viani; Weber, Raissa Renata dos Santos; Bruno, Alexandre Colello; Pavoni, Juliana Fernandes",International journal of radiation biology,349,28

One of the most important methods for COVID-19 detection is the use of techniques such as real time RT-PCR based on a previous extraction/purification of RNA procedure from nasopharyngeal cells using functionalized magnetic nanoparticles (MNP). This technique allows the processing of ~ 10,000 tests per day in private companies and around hundreds per day at local Universities guaranteeing to reach a wide range of the population. However, the main drawback of this method is the need for specialized MNP with a strong negative charge for the viral RNA extraction to detect the existence of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Here we present a simplified low cost method to produce 10 g of nanoparticles in 100 mL of solution that was scaled to one litter by parallelizing the process 10 times in just two days and allowing for the possibility of making ~ 50,000 COVID-19 tests. This communication helps in reducing the cost of acquiring MNP for diverse biomolecular applications supporting developing country budgets constraints and chemical availability specially during the COVID-19 International Health Emergency.","Chacón-Torres, Julio C.; Reinoso, C.; Navas-León, Daniela G.; Briceño, Sarah; González, Gema",Sci Rep,349,33

Moreover, having relatives or acquaintances infected with COVID-19 was a risk factor for increasing the anxiety of college students (OR = 3.007, 95% CI = 2.377 - 3.804). Results of correlation analysis indicated that economic effects, and effects on daily life, as well as delays in academic activities, were positively associated with anxiety symptoms (P < .001). However, social support was negatively correlated with the level of anxiety (P < .001).

The SARS-CoV-2 genome encodes the 2′-O-methyltransferase nsp16, which, when bound to the coactivator nsp10, uses S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) as a donor to transfer a methyl group to the first ribonucleotide of the mRNA in the final step of viral mRNA capping. Here, we provide biochemical and structural evidence that this reaction requires divalent cations, preferably Mn(2+), and a coronavirus-specific four-residue insert. We determined the x-ray structures of the SARS-CoV-2 2′-O-methyltransferase (the nsp16-nsp10 heterodimer) in complex with its reaction substrates, products, and divalent metal cations. These structural snapshots revealed that metal ions and the insert stabilize interactions between the capped RNA and nsp16, resulting in the precise alignment of the ribonucleotides in the active site. Comparison of available structures of 2′-O-methyltransferases with capped RNAs from different organisms revealed that the four-residue insert unique to coronavirus nsp16 alters the backbone conformation of the capped RNA in the binding groove, thereby promoting catalysis. This insert is highly conserved across coronaviruses, and its absence in mammalian methyltransferases makes this region a promising site for structure-guided drug design of selective coronavirus inhibitors.","Minasov, George; Rosas-Lemus, Monica; Shuvalova, Ludmilla; Inniss, Nicole L.; Brunzelle, Joseph S.; Daczkowski, Courtney M.; Hoover, Paul; Mesecar, Andrew D.; Satchell, Karla J.

Here, we present mortality rates and case fatality rates for COVID-19 over the past year compared with other historic leading causes of death in the United States. Among the risk categories considered, COVID-19 is the third leading cause of death for individuals 40 years old and over, with an overall annual mortality rate of 325 deaths per 100K individuals, behind only cancer (385 deaths per 100K individuals) and heart disease (412 deaths per 100K individuals). In addition, for individuals 40 years old and over, the case fatality rate for COVID-19 is greater than the case fatality rate for motor vehicle accidents. In particular, for the age group 40-49, the relative case fatality rate of COVID-19 is 1.5 fold (95% CI: [1.3, 1.7]) that of a motor vehicle accident, demonstrating that SARS-CoV-2 infection may be significantly more dangerous than a car crash for this age group. For older adults, COVID-19 is even more dangerous, and the relative case fatality rate of COVID-19 is 29.4 fold (95% CI: [23.2, 35.7]) that of a motor vehicle accident for individuals over 80 years old. On the other hand, motor vehicle accidents have a 4.5 fold (95% CI: [3.9, 5.1]) greater relative case fatality rate compared to COVID-19 for the age group of 20-29 years. These results highlight the severity of the COVID-19 pandemic especially for adults above 40 years of age and underscore the need for large-scale preventative measures to mitigate risks for these populations. Given that FDA-authorized COVID-19 vaccines have now been validated by multiple studies for their outstanding real-world effectiveness and safety, vaccination of all individuals who are over 40 years of age is one of the most pressing public health priorities of our time.","Puranik, A.; Niesen, M.

The frequency and sources of mass-casualty incidents are currently changing dynamically, especially with the onset of terrorist attacks and large-scale natural disasters. Health services and emergency medical service (EMS) take part in addressing these emergencies. For this reason, this paper deals with the EMS emergency preparedness in the Czech Republic for an emergency events with a large number of affected people. EMS in the Czech Republic are not provided by the state but by individual regions. EMS in the Czech Republic do not have central management, nor do they use uniform data documentation. The investigation of the current situation has shown that the attitudes of EMS in individual regions of the Czech Republic to the tasks of emergency preparedness for mass casualty incidents are not identical. The current method of evaluating improvements in the quality of EMS emergency preparedness lacks consistency and is not comprehensively supervised. To tackle this, the paper presents an internal audit methodology for assessing the level of emergency preparedness of the emergency medical services. The authors therefore defined the decisive criteria and indicators assessing the quality level of EMS emergency preparedness at major disaster with multiple victim incident. When developing the methodological procedure of the preparedness evaluation, an algorithm was chosen, based on the gradual verification of the evaluation criteria and indicators by an expert group. Some findings and recommendations based on a research carried out in EMS in individual regions of the Czech Republic are presented.","Tušer, Irena; Bekešienė, Svajonė; Navrátil, Josef",Qual Quant,349,20

Exposure to respiratory droplets can theoretically be reduced by surgical mask usage. However, there is a lack of experimental evidence supporting surgical mask usage for prevention of COVID-19. METHODS: We used a well-established golden Syrian hamster SARS-CoV-2 model. We placed SARS-CoV-2-challenged index hamsters and naïve hamsters into closed system units each comprising two different cages separated by a polyvinyl chloride air porous partition with unidirectional airflow within the isolator. The effect of a surgical mask partition placed in between the cages was investigated. Besides clinical scoring, hamster specimens were tested for viral load, histopathology, and viral nucleocapsid antigen expression. RESULTS: Non-contact transmission was found in 66.7% (10/15) of exposed naïve hamsters. Surgical mask partition for challenged index or naïve hamsters significantly reduced transmission to 25% (6/24, P=0.018). Surgical mask partition for challenged index hamsters significantly reduced transmission to only 16.7% (2/12, P=0.019) of exposed naïve hamsters. Unlike the severe COVID-19 manifestations of challenged hamsters, infected naïve hamsters had lower clinical scores, milder histopathological changes, and lower viral nucleocapsid antigen expression in respiratory tract tissues. CONCLUSIONS: SARS-CoV-2 could be transmitted by respiratory droplets or airborne droplet nuclei in the hamster model. Such transmission could be reduced by surgical mask usage, especially when masks were worn by infected individuals.","Chan, Jasper Fuk-Woo; Yuan, Shuofeng; Zhang, Anna Jinxia; Poon, Vincent Kwok-Man; Chan, Chris Chung-Sing; Lee, Andrew Chak-Yiu; Fan, Zhimeng; Li, Can; Liang, Ronghui; Cao, Jianli; Tang, Kaiming; Luo, Cuiting; Cheng, Vincent Chi-Chung; Cai, Jian-Piao; Chu, Hin; Chan, Kwok-Hung; To, Kelvin Kai-Wang; Sridhar, Siddharth; Yuen, Kwok-Yung",Clin Infect Dis,349,33

The biggest instructional change was found to be in teaching behaviors, followed by technology use, with only small changes in beliefs about online teaching. Factors that most highly correlated with instructional change were individual educators’ technology acceptance and innovation propensity, media synchronicity of the course, and the fidelity of institutional support.

METHODS: Online cross‐sectional survey of 2777 self‐selected UK adults. RESULTS: Thirty percent of participants reported drinking more frequently in lockdown, 16% reported drinking more units per drinking occasion and 14% reported more frequent HED. For men and women, increased frequency of drinking was associated with being less likely to believe alcohol drinking would lead to greater chance of catching COVID‐19 (men: OR = 0.99, 95% CI = 0.98, 1.00; women: OR = 0.99, 95% CI = 0.99, 1.00) and deterioration in psychological wellbeing (OR = 1.27, 95% CI = 1.04, 1.54; OR = 1.29, 95% CI = 1.11, 1.51); increased unit consumption was associated with deterioration in financial situation (OR = 1.50, 95% CI = 1.21, 1.86; OR = 1.31, 95% CI = 1.05, 1.64) and physical health (OR = 1.31, 95% CI = 1.03, 1.67; OR = 1.66, 95% CI = 1.31, 2.10).

Our previous study demonstrated that PA-X decreases the virulence of a highly pathogenic H5N1 strain A/Chicken/Jiangsu/k0402/2010 in mice. However, the underlying mechanism of virulence attenuation associated with PA-X is still unknown. In this study, we compared two PA-X-deficient mutant viruses and the parental virus in terms of induction of pathology and manipulation of host response in the mouse lung, stimulation of cell death and PA nuclear accumulation. We first found that down-regulated PA-X expression markedly aggravated the acute lung injury of the infected mice early on day 1 post-infection (p.i.). We then determined that loss of PA-X expression induced higher levels of cytokines, chemokines and complement-derived peptides (C3a and C5a) in the lung, especially at early time point’s p.i. In addition, in vitro assays showed that the PA-X-deficient viruses enhanced cell death and increased expression of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in mammalian cells. Moreover, we also found that PA nuclear accumulation of the PA-X-null viruses accelerated in MDCK cells. These results demonstrate that PA-X decreases the level of complement components, ROS, cell death and inflammatory response, which may together contribute to the alleviated lung injury and the attenuation of the virulence of H5N1 virus in mice.","Hu, Jiao; Mo, Yiqun; Gao, Zhao; Wang, Xiaoquan; Gu, Min; Liang, Yanyan; Cheng, Xin; Hu, Shunlin; Liu, Wenbo; Liu, Huimou; Chen, Sujuan; Liu, Xiaowen; Peng, Daxing; Liu, Xiufan",Med Microbiol Immunol,349,24
